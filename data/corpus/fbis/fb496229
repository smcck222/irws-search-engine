<F P=106> [Unattributed "own information" report in the "Poklonnaya </F>
Hill [pun meaning the war memorial in Moscow and a place where 
one bows to authority in a bid to obtain a favor]" column: "How 
To Dispose of 111 Billion. New Facts About the Subsidy 
Commission"] 
  [Text] According to informal reports from government 
sources, Mikhail Poltoranin, current chairman of the State Duma 
Information Policy and Communications Committee, intends to head 
a subsidy commission (it will possibly be called more 
"democratically" a public council) which is being set up to 
distribute among the needy publications government funds 
allocated to maintain the domestic press. The sum of 111 
billion is not very large and therefore obviously many chief 
editors will go hat in hand to Poltoranin like in the good old 
days, and he will be making eyes at some and thumbing his nose 
at others. An important question now being aired in the Russian 
Press Committee, which has lobbied for increased government 
subsidies, is the composition of this commission. It was 
expected that the commission would include primarily experienced 
journalists, enjoying the unquestionable respect of their 
colleagues, people with a name. It seems, however, that its 
bulk will be constituted by State Duma deputies who are already 
actively seeking to take their chance to direct and boss the 
media around. In all likelihood it will be Poltoranin himself 
who will be selecting subsidy commission members. 
  It will be recalled that a similar, 1993-style, commission 
to 
distribute budget funds between the publications included two 
representatives of the State Press Committee, two deputies from 
the then Russian Federation Supreme Soviet's Mass Media 
Committee, and two deputies from the Supreme Soviet Budget 
Committee. It should be noted that the promised 111 billion is 
not available so far. At first the Finance Ministry was going 
to resolve this problem in April, but now it does not promise to 
provide the funds until the end of May. Actually the subsidy 
commission is to be established by the moment the funds come 
forth.

<F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report in the "Concept" column: "Sergey </F>
Glazyev Is Making Preparations for the Second Budget Reading. 
The People's Alliance Designs an Institution of Direct 
Democracy"] 
  [Text] Leaders of the People's Alliance held a press 
conference in the State Duma yesterday on budget and economic 
policy matters. Journalists were also presented with a draft 
federal law, On People's Legislative Initiative. This draft 
should "for the first time give Russia's citizens the right to 
submit a particular law to parliament by raising signatures." 
This draft federal law has been moved in the State Duma by 
People's Alliance member Muravyev, who in a note of explanation 
cites the experience of such an institution of "direct 
democracy" in many countries, for instance, Switzerland, Italy, 
and Brazil. Characteristically, the proposed draft grants the 
right of legislative initiative to groups of no less than 1 
million citizens. This deprives the draft of much of its 
relevance but shows an evolution in public relations methods 
characteristic of a competitive political environment where 
there is not always room for formations like the People's 
Alliance. 
  Perhaps the most substantive part of the press conference 
was 
a statement by Sergey Glazyev, State Duma Economic Policy 
Committee chairman, who expressed his attitude to the budget 
approved on the first reading and the results of the vote. 
  In Sergey Glazyev's opinion the government did not introduce 
any significant changes into the budget, limiting itself to 
local adjustments, such as: increasing the budget deficit, 
raising privatization revenues by a trillion, and so forth. 
  Glazyev sees the budget policy underlying the approved draft 
as consisting in the distribution of resources between the fuel 
and energy and the agro-industrial complexes. At the same time 
it fails to take into account the priorities of supporting 
science-intensive industry and promoting conversion which were 
set forth in the presidential message. 
  There is still a glaring contradiction between the 
government 
forecast which was used as a basis for the estimate and the 
actual decline in industry, which twice exceeds the estimates 
made at the budget formulation stage. The Economic Policy 
Committee chairman describes the volumes of recession themselves 
as an all-time record for Russia (25 percent in the first half) 
since the Civil War. 
  Glazyev believes that as a result of the current policy a 
real threat is emerging to Russia's economic sovereignty. 
  "Even if we decided that we do not need a science-intensive 
industry, the budget does not provide for any production 
mothballing funds anyway," Sergey Glazyev stated. This 
"oversight" in its turn leads to unprepared stoppages of 
enterprises, which increases the number of industrial accidents. 
There are still no changes in the investment sphere: equipment 
obsolescence is on average approximately 60 percent. 
  Sergey Glazyev supposes that "it is time to start closing 
the 
gaps." He drew the audience's attention to those expenditures 
on which he thinks financing should be increased (defense 
orders, communications, investment projects, education and 
culture) and also revenues raising, which could lead to 
problems. In particular this refers to revenues from the state 
property in state ownership, the abolition of concessions in 
foreign economic activity, and improving import control (Sergey 
Glazyev estimates the volume of smuggling, on which tariffs 
could be charged, at $5 billion). Also, taking a short-term 
view, the Duma economist proposed suspending the privatization 
of the Russian joint stock company Gazprom, whose annual 
revenues come to $7 billion. 
  Assessing the results of the voting on the draft budget in 
the first reading, Sergey Glazyev justly pointed to a lack of 
constructive opposition in parliament ("some pretend that they 
pursue liberalization, and others that they do not approve of 
this line"), which results in the invariability of the existing 
policy. 
  Glazyev's statement at the press conference was followed by 
a 
presentation from Veniamin Sokolov, author of an alternative 
draft budget. Mr. Sokolov expressed his extreme dissatisfaction 
with the fall in the rate of inflation because each percentage 
point is paid for with 5 percent of production. Having made 
some reasonable propositions about the problems of monetary 
circulation in Russia, Veniamin Sokolov stated that he could 
ensure a doubling of budget revenues as early as the end of this 
year if a tax reform and a corresponding credit and money policy 
were conducted.

  [Text] The head of a parliamentary committee said Russia's 
agrarian reforms are following "the wrong course" and might lead 
to famine. 
  "The electricity per worker ratio in the agrarian sector of 
Russia is less than one-tenth of that in Western Europe, while 
the low productivity is at present predetermining the depth of 
the abyss where the agrarian sector is quietly rolling," said 
Vyacheslav Zvolinskiy, chairman of the Agrarian Policy Committee 
of the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament. 
  The "wrong course" for Russian agriculture has been charted 
not by science but by politicians, "who are carrying out their 
reforms, both in the countryside and elsewhere, at the expense 
of the people, above all the peasantry," Zvolinskiy, who is an 
agricultural scientist, said in an interview with Interfax on 
Saturday. 
  "What we are witnessing in Russia today is a struggle among 
foreign spheres of influence forced on the country by the world 
community," he continued. For this reason, the Agrarian Policy 
Committee is determined "to defend the interests of the Russian 
peasantry to the end" and do its best to have "the executive 
branch carry out unconditionally and as accurately as possible" 
Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha's April 27 directive 
on the agrarian reform.

<F P=106> [Statement by Liberal Democratic Union of 12 December in the </F>
"Document" rubric, dated 12 May] 
  [Text] On 11 May, the Russian Federation State Duma passed 
in the first reading by a small majority of votes a draft 
federal budget for 1994 submitted by the government, and 
confirmed its main indicators: outlays, revenues, and the 
maximum level of budget deficit. 
  Our faction jointly spoke for passing this decision whereby 
it decided the outcome of the voting to a considerable extent. 
  We realize that the structure of the submitted draft budget 
only preserves the position that prevails today in the national 
economy, and suggests no radical changes in its sorry condition. 
Clearly insufficient funds are set aside for education and 
science, the outlays for the maintenance of the state apparatus 
are too high, and so on. 
  We are convinced that the size of the confirmed maximum 
level 
of budget deficit is on the verge of the so-called "controlled" 
inflation, whereas the amount of fiscal pressure allows for no 
invigoration of the economy whatever, suppresses private 
initiative, and prevents the possibility of creating new jobs on 
a large scale in conditions of growing unemployment. 
  We did realize, however, that all delays in the Duma's 
discussion of the draft budget would have led only to additional 
government concessions to various lobby groups and a further 
bloating of the size of the budget deficit, which would have 
triggered a sharp deepening of the economic crisis. 
  We realized that we could not have expected a better budget 
from the current Russian Federation Government (we could have 
expected a much worse one), and the finally passed draft still 
considerably limits the appetites of those agencies and sectors 
in the business of wasting the taxpayers' money, and puts the 
entire blame for the almost inevitable breaches of the confirmed 
budgetary indicators on the government. A nonacceptance of the 
budget would have amounted to raising the question of the 
government's resignation, something that is politically 
unrealistic today. 
  We see our decision as a show of political responsibility 
and 
we do not share the stance of some of the factions that voted 
against the passing of the budget for other, purely political 
reasons.

  [Text] Uladzimir Zamyatalin, Belarusian prime minister's 
press secretary, stated that "... implementing an agreement on 
economic and monetary union between Belarus and Russia is 
already under way." The implementation mechanism of the 
agreement's first nine items, signed by Deputy Prime Minister 
Oleg Saskavets on 30 April has, as a matter of fact, come into 
force. It provides, the press secretary underlined, for removal 
of customs duties on all types of Belarusian-Russian goods that 
represent more than 30 percent of their costs. Uladzimir 
Zamyatalin noted that Belarusian products will become 
competitive on the Russian and CIS markets if their costs are 
reduced by one-third. As early as May and June, orders received 
by enterprises and sale of products that jammed warehouses will 
tangibly influence the Belarusian economy. "According to 
commitments stemming from the agreement," the press secretary 
said, "the Republic will soon receive from the Russian side 200 
billion rubles in credits to stabilize the Belarusian financial 
system, as well as to level out prices and the average salary. 
With the first part of the signed agreement taking effect, the 
Belarusian Government can start improving a program designed to 
stabilize the national economy in 1994-95, and undertake a range 
of social protection measures. In particular, the decision 
allowing pensioners to ride suburban trains free of charge is a 
part of those measures."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Over 100,000 Signatures Were </F>
Collected in Support of S. Shushkevich"] 
  [Text] An initiative group supporting Stanislaw Shushkevich 
has collected over 100,000 signatures. This was declared by 
Henadz Shcharbinin, chief of the group for collecting 
signatures, at a news conference on 13 May. The 100,000th 
signature was placed by Belarusian National Bank Chairman 
Stanislaw Bahdankevich. Hence, the initiative group for support 
of S. Shushkevich has cleared the hurdle set by the law on 
presidential elections. According to Aleh Trusaw, chairman of 
the Belarusian Social Democratic Association, specific 
difficulties have arisen recently when signature lists had to be 
registered at the executive committees: Most of these 
administration bodies worked according to their usual schedule 
-- with a break for lunch -- making it very inconvenient for 
collectors of signatures who had to leave work to register the 
signature lists. In Byalynichi, Stolbtsy, for example, officers 
of executive councils would unexpectedly leave their offices. 
Collection of signatures was impeded in various ways: There 
were cases where authorities broke up picket lines of collectors 
of signatures in Minsk and Gomel. Usually collectors were not 
allowed to enter garrisons. The initiative group reported all 
these facts to the Central Election Commission for Presidential 
Elections. 
  Henadz Shcharbinin added that already a few days before 15 
May, regional election commissions began checking petitions 
supporting Kebich. When they discovered violations of 
legislation, they corrected petitions according to the law. 
Henadz Shcharbinin demonstrated some petitions in support of 
Kebich, on which one person signed for several people, which is 
a serious violation of the law on elections.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau], 12 May -- Moldavia [Moldova] 
will be able to restore its economy, retrieve its former 
positions, and gain a foothold on the huge Eastern market 
through the creation of a single economic space of the CIS 
countries, which will function without administrative and 
economic difficulties. This was stated today by President 
Mircea Snegur at his meeting with Christoph Parisini, Austrian 
ambassador to Moldavia. 
  Joining the CIS and the Economic Union is a natural 
necessity 
for the republic's economy, which is closely connected with the 
economies of the Commonwealth countries, Mircea Snegur stressed. 
In his words, Moldavia plans to make its goods competitive by 
modernizing its industry, including the processing industry, 
with the help of Western firms. 
  Mircea Snegur said that after conducting the first 
democratic 
elections and the sociological poll on independence, the 
socio-political situation in Moldavia gives rise to optimism. 
The well-balanced stand of the parliamentary majority creates 
prerequisites for settling the Gagauz and Dniester problems. 
  In the president's opinion, the decentralization of power by 
way of granting a special legal status to the left-bank regions 
is a sensible compromise.

  [Text] "A Russian military base by no means can be set up 
on the territory of Moldova. Such allegations are a 
falsification by mass media," President Mircea Snegur said at a 
meeting with the U.S. deputy state secretary, chief coordinator 
of the State Department for the CIS James Collins in Kishinev 
[Chisinau]. 
  Snegur acknowledged that the synchronization of the 
withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army from Moldova with giving the 
Transdniestria a special legal status "is yet a subject for 
discussions with the Russian side." At the same time, Snegur 
pointed out that he categorically objects to such an approach. 
  Collins praised "the fact of common vision by the Moldovan 
leadership of the ways to settle the problems of Transdniestria 
and villages populated by Gagauzes." 
  As an official representative of the Gagauz administration 
told INTERFAX, representatives of Gagauzes and the Moldovan 
leadership are expected to sign a conciliatory protocol in 
Komrat (the center of the self-proclaimed Gagauz republic) on 
Saturday [14 May]. The same source said that if by that time 
the existing differences are not eliminated, the sides will wait 
for the conclusions of the European Council regarding the draft 
law on the status of Gagauzia. During last week's visit by the 
European Council delegation to Moldova the draft law was handed 
by representatives of Gagauzes to this international 
organization for studying and making a conclusion. 
IF Note: On Thursday the Moldovan parliamentary commission on 
defining the special legal status for regions populated by 
Gagauzes met in Kishinev. A delegation of the Gagauz parliament 
led by Vice- President of the non-recognized Gagauz republic 
Petr Buzadzhi took part in its work. The Gagauz leaders stated 
their readiness for certain compromises, but they continue to 
insist that the law should determine the status of Gagauzia as a 
national-territorial state unit with its own constitution.

  [Text] Tehran, 14 May -- The main points on the agenda of 
the talks that will be held by Kazakhstani Prime Minister Sergey 
Tereshchenko, who arrived in the Iranian capital this morning on 
an official three-day visit, will be questions of commercial and 
economic cooperation between Kazakhstan and Iran. He is 
accompanied by a delegation that includes the ministers of power 
engineering and fuel resources, transport, the chairman of the 
Chamber of Commerce, the chairman of the central bank, and 
parliamentarians. It is intended that the Kazakhstani prime 
minister will be received by Iranian President 'Ali Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  Speaking on his arrival at Tehran's Mehrabad airport, 
S.Tereshchenko stressed that "very close and friendly relations" 
exist between Kazakhstan and Iran. He noted that a number of 
basic documents on bilateral cooperation were signed during the 
visits by the presidents of Kazakhstan and Iran to Tehran and 
Almaty. Therefore, the main aim of the present visit is to step 
up the work to implement the agreements that have been reached 
already and to remove all obstacles in the way of stepping up 
commercial and economic cooperation between the two countries. 
  Iranian First Vice President Hasan Habibi, who met 
Tereshchenko, confirmed that the talks would focus on stepping 
up the implementation of agreements signed earlier by the two 
presidents, as well as on other accords.

  [Text] Kazakhstan is poised to lease Russia facilities on 
the air defense test ground in Sary-Shagan (situated on Lake 
Balkhash in Central Kazakhstan), Kazakh Vice-Premier and 
Minister for Science and New Technology Galym Abilsiitov told 
INTERFAX Friday [13 May]. 
  He said the documents discussed during talks on the lease 
agreement in the town of Priozyorsk (where the test ground's 
personnel live) from 10-13 May were not yet finalized, but the 
main requirements and terms of the lease had already been 
established. Abilsiitov said that some of the site's facilities 
would be leased to the Russian military unit running the site, 
and that unit would pay rent and make some contribution to the 
upkeep of Priozyorsk. 
  He also said that the dates and size of the rent and 
compensation for damage had not been discussed with the site's 
commander General Anatoliy Tarasov. The vice-premier said that 
those issues would be dealt with in Almaty with 
Commander-in-Chief of Russia's Air Defense Forces 
General-Lieutenant Viktor Prudnikov. 
  Abilsiitov said the lease agreement for Sary-Shagan would 
differ from the one for Baykonur in that Priozyorsk would remain 
a fully Kazakh town. A national center for radio-electronics 
and communications, he said, was currently being set up there, 
and the ore mining company Balkhash would also finish building 
an enrichment center and begin to refine gold ores there in July. 
  Abilsiitov pointed out that those organizations would, 
jointly with the Russian servicemen, be responsible for the 
town's well-being.

and 13 of the Moskovskiy border guard unit of opposition 
militants, as well as discover and destroy arms caches in that 
area. 
  A total of 700 men, including troops of Tajikistan's Defense

"Tajik Opposition Is Unhappy With Russian Federation Foreign 
Affairs Ministry Statement. But Is Ready To Consider a Draft 
Temporary Cease-Fire Agreement"] 
  [Text] A recent statement made by the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs following aggravation in the 
situation on the Tajik-Afghan border has caused discontent in 
Tajik opposition circles. The statement said that the 
"leadership of a number of intransigent opposition groupings 
affiliated with the Tajikistan Islamic Revival Movement [TIRM] 
is getting ready to launch a spring-summer `onslaught' which is 
planned to begin with armed provocations on the Tajik-Afghan 
border. In these circumstances the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs deems it necessary to state that the Russian leadership 
regards the planned armed provocations as a threat to the 
interests of security not only of Tajikistan but also Russia ... 
and it... will take adequate steps to stop them." 
  On 11 May the TIRM came out with a response statement which 
says, "We have fought for our civil rights, for the possibility 
freely to live and work in our motherland, and we shall continue 
to fight for this.... We have nothing against the CIS 
Collective Peacekeeping Forces present in Tajikistan to protect 
the republic against foreign intervention. But they, under the 
treaty, must not interfere in the internal Tajik conflict." 
  The document also notes, "...the statement by the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs in which Russia's foreign 
policy department... threatens to take `adequate' measures 
arouses bewilderment. ...Neither Afghanistan nor any other 
country is going to threaten the security of Tajikistan or other 
CIS countries. We, the citizens of Tajikistan, temporarily 
staying outside the Republic, including in Afghanistan, want to 
return to our Motherland," while "the real threat to security... 
are those forces that prevent a peaceful settlement of the 
conflict," the authors of the document point out. 
  Nonetheless the TIRM declares its readiness to consider a 
draft temporary cease-fire on the Tajik-Afghan border and to 
observe the terms of the agreement after it has been signed. 
  The statement stresses that in the course of inter-Tajik 
negotiations in Moscow in April the opposition delegation 
proposed a draft temporary cease-fire agreement but "the other 
side did not want to discuss it, which testifies to the 
destructive position of the Dushanbe regime."

  [Text] "Rumors that the Tajik leadership is disinterested 
in finding a peaceful solution to the internal political strife 
and wants to increase Russian military presence to crush the 
opposition are groundless," Foreign Minister Rashid Alimov told 
INTERFAX. He said that Dushanbe had "sufficient good will to 
continue the dialog." 
  Alimov believes that the "current state of the internal 
dialog gives inspires a cautious optimism." He said the main 
thing was that the "negotiations process has been launched and 
the parties involved have agreed to further peace talks." 
  "We want to elevate the talks to a constructive plane and 
put 
an end to confrontation," Alimov stressed. He said the next 
round of talks between the Tajik and opposition leaders might 
even take place in Dushanbe in the first 10 days of June. UN 
representatives, he added, would decide on the final date and 
venue. 
IF Note: The UN secretary general's special representative for 
Tajikistan Ramires Piriz-Bollon is currently in Teheran, from 
where he will travel to Islamabad and then Dushanbe on 25-27 
May. He will be accompanied to the Tajik capital by the UN 
deputy general secretary for political affairs, Marek Goulding. 
The date and venue of the next round of Tajik internal talks is 
for those officials to decide. 
  Meanwhile, the Tajik Islamic Renaissance Movement issued a 
statement a few days ago on its readiness to consider a draft 
cease-fire agreement for the Tajik-Afghan border and observe its 
terms, if signed. The people behind the document recall that 
the opposition delegation at the peace talks in Moscow in April 
had proposed a cease-fire draft but that "the other side refused 
even to discuss its contents, demonstrating the Dushanbe 
regime's destructive position." 
IF Note: A joint communique on the talks between Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and Tajik leader Emomali Rahmonov 
contained support for the Tajik leadership's stance regarding 
the continuation of dialog with the aim of building a democratic 
Tajikistan. For that, firm commitment to the mutual cessation 
of hostilities, measures to restore and fortify mutual trust and 
the unhindered and safe return of refugees and forced migrants 
to the Republic were needed, the communique stated. 
  The statement mentioned that the Tajik opposition posed no 
threat to Tajikistan itself, Russia or other CIS states. "We are 
citizens of Tajikistan finding ourselves temporarily outside the 
Republic's frontiers and want to return to our homeland and live 
in our own homes," it read. 
  "Those forces which would obstruct the peaceful settlement 
of 
the conflict pose the real threat to the security of Tajikistan 
and other countries," the statement's authors said. The 
document also pointed out that the opposition was looking for a 
political way to end the conflict: "We have no objection to the 
presence of CIS Collective Peace-Keeping forces in Tajikistan to 
protect the country from inroads from outside." 
IF Note: In their communique, Yeltsin and Rahmonov highlighted 
the stabilizing role of the CIS forces in Tajikistan. "The joint 
efforts to provide reliable protection and defense for the 
southern borders, especially the Tajik-Afghan section, meet the 
interests of all CIS countries," the communique read. 
  "Our campaign is not directed against any state and in no 
way 
does it threaten the security interests of Russia or any other 
CIS country. This is a conflict between the Tajik opposition 
and a close circle of individuals who forced us to leave our 
homeland," the Islamic Renaissance Movement's statement stressed.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>
  [Text] Dushanbe 16 May TASS -- Special units of 
Tajikistan's Interior Ministry and the country's special 
services are mounting a large-scale operation "Mak-94" 
(Poppy-94) to locate and eliminate plantations of opium poppy 
and hemp, an uphill job because most of the plantations, some of 
which cover tens of hectares, are located in the mountainous 
regions of northern and eastern Tajikistan, difficult-of-access. 
This was announced in an interview with ITAR-TASS by First 
Deputy Interior Minister of Tajikistan, Major-General Gennadiy 
Blinov. 
  He explained that the owners of such plantations are, as a 
rule, were alarmed and often have tested ties with local 
authorities. [as received] 
  The wave of drug-trafficking and drug abuse continues to 
sweep Tajikistan, which has become a major base from which 
narcotics are delivered to near abroad and Western Europe, 
Gennadiy Blinov said. He stressed that practically one half of 
crimes committed in the republic is associated with the 
narco-business. 
  Since the beginning of this year, Tajikistan's security 
forces have suppressed 19 attempts at illegal exports of 
unprocessed opium and hashish and located tens of underground 
syndicates specialising in manufacturing and storing narcotics, 
the general said. A total of 200 kg of drugs have been seized. 
  However according to General Blinov, the main flow of drugs 
comes from neighbouring Afghanistan to Tajikistan's 
Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, where several drug barons 
run mafia-like groups. According to Gennadiy Blinov, the drug 
flow from Afghanistan can be suppressed by tightening control 
over the Pamir stretch of the Tajik-Afghan border, which 
regrettably remains highly transparent. 
  For a number of reasons only between 15 and 20 in each 
hundred of crimes associated with narcotics are ever exposed, 
the general said. He called for a comprehensive state programme 
and concerted efforts of the security agencies of all 
Commonwealth member-countries, whose ties have weakened 
considerably since the break-up of the Soviet Union.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent ITAR-TASS Oleg Lukin] </F>
  [Text] Ashgabat, 14 May -- The privatization of trade 
outlets and industrial sites will begin in Turkmenistan on 1 
June. This is stipulated in a resolution signed by Saparmurad 
Niyazov on 13 May. The privatization of trade outlets will be 
carried out through auctions, tenders, and sales. Retail trade 
outlets selling consumer goods will be privatized in the first 
instance. 
  The authorities in the capital and oblasts have been given 
personal responsibility to ensure that newly privatized outlets 
function effectively, while staying in the same line of business. 
  Small industrial enterprises employing up to 100 people will 
be bought by members of working collectives, and will also be 
sold to citizens of Turkmenistan and foreigners. Private 
individuals and foreign firms will have to take part in 
investment tenders and later ensure their own supplies of raw 
materials. Enterprises employing more than 100 people will be 
transformed into joint-stock companies with the controlling 
packet of shares being retained by the government. 
  The president's resolution envisages subsidies for working 
collectives during the destatification of their enterprises. In 
particular, employees will receive some shares free of charge, 
while state property will be sold to them with a 25 percent 
price reduction with up to one year credit facility. 
  Income gained from privatization will be channelled to the 
central government budget.

  [Textt] Turkmenistan will most likely deny Occidental 
Petroleum participation in a project to develop one of the 
Central Asian republic's oil and gas fields, said a senior 
official at Turkmenistan's Petroleum and Gas Ministry. 
  The refusal would come very shortly, the official told the 
Oil Information Agency. 
  He said the American corporation, which had won the right to 
work the Burun oil and gas field in western Turkmenistan in an 
international tender last November, was, under the terms of the 
tender, to form a joint venture with the Turkmen concern 
Balkanneftekhimprom, but had still not signed an agreement to 
that effect, "from time to time notifying its Turkmen partner 
about the dwindling interest in oil in the world market and 
about the difficulties of transportation of crude oil from 
Turkmenistan," while not having withdrawn from the project 
officially. 
  For this reason, Turkmenistan will most likely choose 
another 
foreign partner. A source told the Oil Information Agency that 
after preliminary negotiations, the Turkish national petroleum 
company had stated its willingness to form a project to develop 
the Burun and Barsa-Gelmez oil and gas deposits. 
  Turkmenistan is expected to make the final decision before 
the end of May. The Turkish company would be offered the same 
terms as Occidental Petroleum, namely it would have to pay a 
$20-million bonus, invest $50 million in the project within the 
next five years and receive 25 pct of the profit, the Turkmen 
partner appropriating the other 75 pct. 
  The reserves of Burun are estimated at 35 million tonnes of 
oil, those of Barsa-Gelmez at 31 million tonnes. Today the two 
fields annually yield 207,000 tonnes and 1.2 million tonnes of 
oil respectively.

  [Text] The working document that needs to be signed to join 
in NATO's Partnership for Peace program is not enough for 
Russia. This was stated in Geneva today by Andrey Kozyrev. 
According to him the NATO document is very abstract and is of a 
preliminary character. Kozyrev stated that Moscow is preparing 
its own program for cooperation with the North Atlantic 
Alliance. It consists of three component parts and covers 
matters relating to cooperation between military departments, 
conversion, and interaction in the sphere of peacekeeping.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>
  [Text] Brussels May 13 TASS -- Russia and NATO will 
possibly sign two documents on cooperation simultaneously: a 
framework document on the "Partnership for Peace" programme and 
a bilateral programme for partnership, said Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin in an exclusive interview 
with ITAR-TASS here on Friday after today's meeting with NATO 
Deputy Secretary-General Gebhardt von Moltke. 
  In the opinion of the deputy minister this "should remove 
misunderstandings and apprehensions on both sides". 
  "I have developed an impression that NATO started to 
understand better after the recent events around the Bosnian 
city of Gorazde that real partnership presupposes serious 
preliminary consulations with Russia before taking decisions," 
he added. 
  "Partnership for Peace is only a part of the general picture 
of our cooperation, although an important one," the deputy 
minister continued. "In this case, the sides should find a true 
correlation between the principle of equality of all countries 
wishing to join the programme for multilateral cooperation and 
the objective account of Russia's role and position." 
  Therefore, the sides will put signatures under the 
multilateral document already signed by 16 NATO countries and 18 
east European states, including eight former Soviet republics, 
on the one hand, and a bilateral programme of partnership 
between NATO and Russia, determining specific parameters of 
cooperation, on the other. 
  "Regrettably," Adamishin noted, "there is much confusion 
about the multilateral document in our country. In actual fact, 
it is a statement of intention to cooperate and not to conduct 
hostile actions. 
  "If we compare it with the trade and economic sphere, it is 
'a protocol of intent' which should be specified and amplified. 
But it does not impose any obligations on either side to take 
joint decisions, to conduct joint operations or to standardise 
weapons. That is, it does not tie our hands." 
  The bilateral document can and must be more specific, and 
NATO, according to Von Moltke, is waiting with great interest 
for the Russian side's ideas on this issue. 
  "Nobody will be able and does not intend to thrust upon us 
anything in the bilateral programme, which would not suit 
Russia," Adamishin stressed. 
  The deputy minister said that at today's talks, the NATO 
leadership spoke of serious importance it attaches to 
cooperation with Russia and of a desire to expand it, especially 
through contacts between the military. 
  This would help the two sides "to forget the image of an 
enemy". NATO already reveals some secrets to Russia, which were 
a relish piece for intelligence services in the recent past: 
data banks, codes, means of communications, etc. 
  Military and political contacts under the aegis of the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council are also fruitfully developing.

<F P=106> [Article by RIA Novosti correspondent Vitaliy Dymarskiy: </F>
"Daniel Tarschys' Trump Card. Russia Could Join the Council of 
Europe in Early 1995"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg, Paris -- The spring session of the 
Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, which has ended in 
Strasbourg, turned out to be stormy and memorable. Perhaps for 
the first time, mention was made of a more or less concrete 
schedule for Russia's admission to this organization, as yet the 
only pan-European organization to unite countries from both the 
Eastern and Western parts of the continent. Although an exact 
entry date was not officially stated, in the corridors "reliable 
sources" were very specific: 30 January 1995. The Council of 
Europe leadership, and Vladimir Shumeyko, who was on an official 
visit to Strasbourg at the time, and the members of the 
permanent Russian parliamentary delegation were, as behoves 
them, more diplomatic, unanimously placing the final decision on 
Russia's admission in the first quarter of next year -- are 
there not plenty of things that could happen?! 
  Nonetheless, even compared with the January session of the 
Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, a change of position 
with regard to Russia was clearly perceptible. And this is not 
because of the replacement of the secretary general, a post for 
which elections were held at this session. France's Catherine 
Lalumiere, who has done much to boost the prestige of the 
Council of Europe, until recently a little-known organization, 
hoped to be elected for a second consecutive term and was, to 
this end, counting on the representatives of Eastern Europe, 
most of which she brought into the Council of Europe in her 
five-year term. Russia's admission was another trump card in 
Lalumiere's hands, but she was stabbed in the back -- by her own 
French deputies, who were settling old scores of their own. It 
was by their two or three votes that the now former secretary 
general fell short. 
  The Swede Daniel Tarschys, who unexpectedly overtook 
Lalumiere, played the "Russian card" even more. Not only does 
he speak Russian, but his "track record" as a professor includes 
analytical works on the former USSR and Russia, on the downfall 
of totalitarianism, and on other related topics which he 
studied, in part, in Leningrad, where he did a six-month course 
in the eighties. For Tarschys, Russia's admission to the 
Council of Europe is topic number one, since this could be the 
first and biggest result of his term in the post of secretary 
general. In fact, he made no secret of this in an interview 
with your correspondent. 
  Of course, Tarschys expressed all the necessary 
reservations. 
True, the adoption of a new Constitution and free parliamentary 
elections -- this is the first and most important condition of 
admission to the European family, and it has already been 
fulfilled. But the Council of Europe and its commissions and 
experts must in the coming months make a more scrupulous study 
of Russian laws, the effectiveness of the judiciary, and the 
situation regarding human rights and national minorities. Only 
after that will there be a final decision on Russia's compliance 
with European standards. 
  Are these standards uniform? Vladimir Lukin, head of our 
delegation, asked himself that question repeatedly during the 
session, and answered in the negative. In the opinion of the 
chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, 
Russia should, of course, join the Council of Europe, but it is 
unacceptable for special demands to be made on it which are by 
no means always observed by the existing members of the Council 
of Europe. This applies, in particular, to the position of 
national minorities (in the Baltic countries, for instance), the 
presence of troops on other states' territory, etc. Vladimir 
Lukin insisted on an even-handed approach, especially since the 
Council of Europe needs Russia as much as Russia needs the 
Council of Europe. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who is now a member of the official 
Russian delegation to the Council of Europe, sought to fan the 
flames in all the debates. Admittedly this, his first visit to 
Strasbourg, will apparently also be his last, if we are to 
believe the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader's statement 
prior to his departure. Taking the "national patriotic" line to 
absurd extremes, as always, Zhirinovskiy informed the public 
that Russia does not belong in the Council of Europe or the NATO 
Partnership for Peace, or even, moreover, in...the United 
Nations, which, he said, it should immediately quit. What upset 
the "liberal democrat" most of all, however, was the theft of 
his cap during an official reception with Daniel Tarschys 
(incidentally, the Swede is also a liberal democrat, but without 
the quotation marks). Stating that "the price of my headgear at 
auction will soon go up, of course," Zhirinovskiy then left 
Strasbourg, which he found inhospitable and where, among other 
things, he was involved in a clash with demonstrators who had 
gone to the Russian Consulate building to protest the LDP 
leader's presence in France. As for his headgear, our 
delegation was immediately reminded of the old joke: "The 
October Revolution is canceled -- the leader's cap has been 
stolen!" According to that logic, fascism will not win the day 
in Russia.... 
  So, forceful passions seethed at the session, but now, after 
the stormy debates, everything shoould fall into a calm, 
workaday routine. Calm is required on both sides -- in the 
Council of Europe and in Russia. And then, probably, all the 
dates cited for Russia's entry will become real.

  [Text] Geneva May 13 TASS -- Foreign ministers of Russia, 
Belgium, Great Britain, Germany, Greece and France, as well as 
the United States secretary of state coordinated their steps to 
achieve the soonest settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, says a 
communique adopted on results of their today's meeting. 
  The ministers called on the conflicting sides to conclude a 
comprehensive agreement on termination of hostilities and pull 
efforts for the achievement of political settlement without any 
preliminary conditions. 
  They offered the Bosnian sides to begin negotiations under 
the aegis of the contact group within two weeks. The group 
includes representatives of Russia, the United States, the 
European Union and the United Nations. 
  In the opinion of the ministers, the agreement on 
termination 
of combat operations should entail separation of forces, 
withdrawal of heavy armaments and interposition of U.N. forces. 
The agreement should be concluded for four months with a 
possibility of its prolongation. The ministers think that the 
U.N. force in the conflict zone should be reinforced. 
  The fulfilment of the peace settlement agreement, including 
the troops pullback and separation, may result in a gradual lift 
of sanctions introduced by the United Nations.

  [Text] Geneva May 13 TASS -- Foreign ministers from Russia, 
the United States and five European countries met on Friday in 
the U.S. mission to the UN European headquarters. Andrey 
Kozyrev, Warren Christopher and their counterparts from Greece, 
Belgium, Germany, France and Great Britain try to elaborate a 
common position towards Bosnian settlement and bring the 
conflicting parties back to the negotiating table. 
  According to Kozyrev, the discussion is unlike to be easy. 
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival in Geneva, the Russian 
foreign minister said that "although everybody understands the 
necessity of instant termination of combat actions, every party 
(at the negotiations) tries to insert additional demands into 
this definition". 
  Kozyrev estimated chances of compromise, at least over 
principal approaches towards the problem, as 50-50, but said 
that Boris Yeltsin's recent peace proposals "have a good chance 
to become a backbone of possible decisions".

  [Excerpts] [Announcer Yevgeniy Kiselev] Another step taken 
by Russian diplomacy was the meeting in Geneva two days ago 
between foreign ministers of Russia and a number of Western 
countries, who discussed the situation in Bosnia. Moscow still 
insists that the Bosnian conflict can only be settled through 
negotiations. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] There were breaks during the 
meeting, at times some of those attending left the conference 
room to talk one-to-one. Fortunately, it did not spill out into 
any violence, but there were quite a few dramatic moments. [end 
recording] [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] Until now, until yesterday, the 
U.S. side had not once associated itself with those figures, 49 
and 51 percent. Why? Because Washington had always believed 
that the Muslim, or the Muslim-Croat, side has to be heard 
first, and that their proposals should form the basis for 
further work. In their latest proposals signed in Vienna, the 
Muslim-Croat side claimed as much as 58 percent of the 
territory. I can easily imagine, from my endless contacts with 
the sides, that both the Muslims can as yet claim up to 90 
percent, and the Serbs, who also have some hotheads among them, 
can also claim up to 90 percent, leaving their neighbors with 
just a tiny stretch of land. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Geneva, 15 May -- The first reaction from the 
Bosnian sides to the results of the ministerial meeting between 
Russia, the USA and five countries of the European Union 
indicates that it will be possible to move towards a settlement 
on the basis of the adopted document. This was announced to 
journalists in Geneva on Saturday night by Andrey Kozyrev, 
Russian Federation foreign minister. 
  "I must say that the reaction was not bad from both the Serb 
and the Muslim leadership," he noted. "We had contacts with 
Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime minister, during which it became 
clear that there is a considerable opportunity to work towards a 
settlement on the basis of the adopted document. I think that 
the Serbian side is also sending out signals that it is willing 
to begin negotiations without any preconditions, which is very 
important." 
  Nevertheless, the minister believes that considerable effort 
will be needed to bring the two sides closer. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1700 GMT on 14 May carries a 2 1/2 
minute video report by Dmitriy Voskoboynikov from Geneva on the 
13 May meeting between Russian and Western foreign ministers to 
discuss a settlement for Bosnia. Voskoboynikov, in a brief 
interview with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, asks: 
  "Yesterday seven foreign ministers worked out a coordinated 
position. Is it not the case that in a few weeks time, should 
the situation deteriorate -- around Brcko, for instance -- this 
coordination will completely disappear?" 
  Kozyrev responds, "Unfortunately, we should be prepared to 
see our cooperation put to the test, but a fairly good basis has 
been laid down for progressing forward. This is not a complete 
answer to all the questions. These are only the basic elements 
for going on to work out a joint approach which needs to be 
worked on by the parties." 
  The report then continues with a round-up of the Geneva 
meeting.

  [Text] The communique on Bosnia signed on Friday by the 
foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, Britain and 
France and the European Union, "makes unhappy those who would 
like to continue war there." The statement was made at the news 
conference in Geneva by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
following the talks there. 
  The summing-up document says that the settlement in Bosnia 
is 
possible only through talks. It fixes the idea for granting 51 
pct of the territory to the Moslem-Croatian federation (49 pct 
to the Serbs) and says about the possible stage-by-stage lifting 
of sanctions against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia if the 
settlement in materialised. 
  The Russian diplomats with whom an Interfax correspondent 
talked to, stressed those provisions in the communique which, as 
they believe, largely are based on the message by the Russian 
leader Boris Yeltsin to the presidents of the United States and 
France, Bill Clinton and Francois Mitterrand, to British Prime 
Minister John Major and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
  Among them is the need to strictly observe all UN 
resolutions, including the maintenance of the embargo for arms 
deliveries to the Moslems; to deny claims by the Moslems and 
Croats for possessing 58 pct of the Bosnian territory and the 
idea that Bosnia-Herzegovina should consist of two equal parts. 
There is still another point which, according to the Russian 
diplomats, is a "clear hint" to the Moslems that the world 
community will not tolerate hostilities around the town of Brcko. 
  According to a senior Russian diplomats, if Bosnian Serbs 
agree to 49 pct of the territory and withdraw their troops, the 
prospect for the lifting of sanctions from the Union Republic of 
Yugoslavia will be realistic. Otherwise this will mean an 
isolation, he said. 
  As Kozyrev noted at the news conference in Geneva, "our task 
is not to ease life for one side, it is to advance every side to 
reasonable solutions".

Pribytkov] 
  [Text] Geneva, 14 May -- The document from the Geneva 
meeting, which took place on Friday [13 May] clearly shows the 
need to fulfill all the world community's decisions on Bosnia. 
This applies, among other things, to the embargo and the 
sanctions established by the United Nations, Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev told journalists today, commenting on 
the recent decisions of the U.S. Senate and the Russian State 
Duma, envisaging the possibility of a unilateral revision of 
international obligations. 
  In the run-up to the Geneva meeting, we found ourselves on 
the threshold of a kind of war between parliaments. The U.S. 
Senate decision provides for the possibility of the embargo on 
arms deliveries to Bosnia being lifted unilaterally. In our 
Duma there are not a few supporters of a unilateral lifting of 
sanctions against Belgrade. It is true, the minister said, 
"Lukin's amendment" fleshed out the latest Duma decision, and it 
is "fairly balanced." 
  In the Yugoslav conflict, all sides are bearing their share 
of the responsibility, Kozyrev said. It is therefore not 
fortuitous that in the communique of the ministers' meeting on 
Bosnia, both hotbeds of the conflict -- both Gorazde and Brcko 
are mentioned -- even though we had to argue a bit in this 
connection. 
  The head of Russian diplomacy believes that unilateral 
revisions of the UN Security Council [UNSC] decisions would only 
result in the destruction of the system of international 
relations. In that case the fulfillment of international 
treaties would be out of the question, he said. That is why the 
paragraph that mentions strict observance of all UNSC 
resolutions has been included in the Geneva document.

  [Text] Geneva, 14 May -- A meeting between Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher has started at the Russian permanent mission at the 
United Nations' Geneva office. It was learned from Russian 
diplomatic circles that the sides will discuss a range of 
questions on bilateral relations and continue to exchange 
opinions on the settlement in the former Yugoslavia. 
  The Yugoslav crisis was the main topic during the meeting 
between the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, and 
five of the European Union countries, which took place on Friday 
night [13 May]. The participants in the meeting have reached 
agreements on the first steps to be taken toward resolving the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Geneva, 14 May -- The proposals that Boris Yeltsin 
sent to the heads of state before the Geneva meeting of 
ministers on Bosnia were, in fact, laid down in the foundation 
of its final communique. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said 
this to journalists after the meeting with his American 
counterpart, Warren Christopher. They managed to work out a 
single position since all the participants -- the heads of the 
diplomatic departments of the Russian Federation, United States, 
and the five countries of the European Union -- sensed an 
objective necessity to work out a joint position. 
  Replying to a question by an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Andrey 
Kozyrev said Russia would inform Belgrade about the ministers' 
meeting in Geneva. Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the 
Russian president, will leave for the FRY's capital with this 
task on 15 May. 
  In its turn, the American side will also take steps to 
inform 
the participants in the Bosnian conflict about the results of 
the meeting. Warren Christopher told journalists that he would 
meet representatives of Croatia and the Bosnian Government. 
Russia, the United States, the European Community, and the 
United Nations "are acting as a united front for the first 
time", he said. This is "the most significant result of the 
Geneva meeting."

  [Texdt] Geneva, 14 May -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher has stated that a top-level meeting to discuss the 
problem of Bosnia is possible. Such a summit meeting between 
Russia, the United States, the European Union and the United 
Nations "might be desirable," if there is progress toward a 
settlement. He expressed this view to journalists today after 
his talks with Andrey Kozyrev. 
  Warren Christopher recalled that Presidents Boris Yeltsin 
and 
Bill Clinton will meet in Naples in July, when the leaders of 
the seven leading Western countries and Russia gather there. As 
for a summit meeting on Bosnia, a specific date for holding one 
was not discussed at the ministerial meeting in Geneva on 13 
May. However, if the sides consider it necessary, it would be 
possible to arrange summit talks. The deciding factor in this 
will be the "degree of success" of joint moves toward a 
settlement. 
  Andrey Kozyrev stated in his conversation with press 
representatives that the U.S. secretary of state had "spoken 
perhaps for the first time in such a clear way of the need to 
prepare for a summit meeting on Bosnia." Only at this level, 
the Russian minister thinks, can the most complex problems 
relating to the Bosnia crisis be finally resolved. A meeting 
must certainly be well prepared.

  [Text] Geneva, 13 May -- "Our task has been to encourage 
all the parties in the Bosnian conflict toward reasonable 
decisions," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said when 
speaking on the results of the meeting held here today by the 
foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and five 
member-countries of the European Union. Speaking at a news 
conference, he noted that "the process of working out political 
decisions has been started through joint efforts." Those 
attending the talks had striven "to encourage the sides in the 
search for peaceful decisions, to prevent military actions and 
to assist in a settlement." 
  The meeting adopted a joint communique which defines the 
priority moves. "The foundation has been laid for a new stage, 
when the main political forces of the world act on an agreed 
basis," the Russian minister said. He particularly noted the 
call on the conflicting parties to stop hostilities and to start 
talks in the next two weeks. The general position on the 
territorial issue is also of great importance whereby a 
Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia could have 51 percent of 
the territory and Bosnian Serbs 49 percent. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher explained at the 
news conference that it is essentially a question in this case 
of the parameters which were specified earlier which are now 
being proposed as "a basis for further progress." 
  According to French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe the 
participants of the present Geneva meeting are prepared, if need 
be, to meet again next week.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikkov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 13 TASS -- The Russian State Duma adopted 
on Friday, on the first reading, a law which would end in 
Russia's unilateral lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
  "In connection with the unilateral use of international 
sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council against Yugoslavia, 
the absence of a reliable international legal mechanism of 
controlling their implementation (the Duma ruled) to suspend the 
participation of the Russian Federation in carrying out 
international sanctions against the union republic of 
Yugoslavia", the key article of the law says. 
  The lower house of the Russian parliament recommended all 
government agencies and enterprises to fully restore economic, 
political, diplomatic and cultural relations with Serbia and 
Montenegro which were disrupted by the sanctions. 
  The law is yet to be discussed on the second reading, but 
the 
Duma had already recommended the president, the government and 
the Foreign Ministry to "immediately undertake energetic and 
persistent efforts in the UN framework aimed at lifting 
sanctions against the union republic of Yugoslavia up to a 
unilateral refusal to implement the sanctions". 
  Besides, Russian representative at the UN was instructed to 
raise the issue of imposing sanctions against those conflicting 
parties in former Yugoslavia who reject an immediate ceasefire 
and an unconditional beginning of talks. 
  "In case of unilateral lifting of the embargo on arms 
deliveries to Bosnia, Russia should resort to adequate actions 
up to raising the issue of a unilateral withdrawal from the 
regime of sanctions", according to the document. 
  The Duma believes there is currently a real possibility for 
ensuring peace in former Yugoslavia and called on all warring 
parties to "immediately cease all combat activities and begin 
talks on ensuring peace". The chamber said it is ready to 
promote dialogue between the parties. 
  The lower house also addressed parliamentarians of the world 
to refrain from decisions "capable of destabilising the 
situation in former Yugoslavia", and mostly from those which can 
result in shipments of weapons to a warring side. 
  It also proposed to the states bordering on former 
Yugoslavia 
to hold an international conference on overcoming the Balkan 
crisis with the UN and CSCE participation.

  [Text] The factions of the Liberal-Democratic and Russian 
Unity and Accord parties in the State Duma came out with formal 
statements on the Yugoslav developments, Friday. 
  The Liberal Democrats said that, to the growing surprise and 
discontent of the fraternal Serb people, the Duma failed to take 
action on the Yugoslav developments. That damaged the Duma's 
international image. 
  The Liberal Democrats felt the Duma's strategy for the 
former 
Yugoslavia must be based on the message of the numerous 
addresses and statements made by their leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  They advised the Duma to replace discussions of the Yugoslav 
developments with resolute moves against barbaric anti-Yugoslav 
actions by the United States, Germany and other countries. 
  The Liberal Democrats suggested that Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev address, without delay, the State Duma. Depending on 
what he had to say, the Duma would decide whether he could 
remain in office. 
  The faction of the Russian Unity and Accord party in the 
State Duma said, in turn, that mistakes by the Foreign Ministry 
tended to aggravate the Bosnian conflict. The Unity and Accord 
party felt Moscow had blundered by hurrying to recognize unitary 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, favoring the idea of one-sided 
anti-Yugoslav sanctions and giving the green light to NATO's 
plans to bomb Serb positions. 
  The parliamentary faction of the Unity and Accord party 
called for immediate action on President Yeltsin's initiative 
for an international conference on the Balkans. 
  It said Russia was to be the first to propose the lifting of 
the "meaningless and unfair anti-Yugoslav sanctions". And if 
the Croats and Moslems moved to torpedo peace negotiations, 
Russia must push for the introduction of sanctions against those 
two communities.

  [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Russia must unilaterally 
halt its participation in implementing the international 
sanctions imposed against the Republic of Yugoslavia. This is 
stated in a law that deputies passed in its first reading today. 
  In the opinion of one of those who drew up the draft law, 
Deputy Vladimir Isakov, this document is important from the 
internal political viewpoint, as well as from the international 
viewpoint. 
  [Begin Isakov recording] This is the first time that we have 
moved into the sphere of foreign policy, although, according to 
the Constitution, we do have this right, precisely in the form 
of adopting a law. This was a very difficult step for the Duma, 
too. It is possible that there will be reaction not only to the 
content of the law, but also to the Duma's display of 
independence on this question. You know that the president 
reacts very painfully to any display of independence by other 
state bodies. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] It must be said that the law has yet to undergo 
its second reading and also to receive approval from the 
Federation Council and the president. If this approval is not 
received, the State Duma can adopt the law by a constitutional 
majority, that is by two-thirds of the votes. 
  Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the International Affairs 
Committee, told our radio station about the possible 
consequences if this law is approved. 
  [Begin Lukin recording] It is an extremely incompetent, 
declarative, and demagogic law. Moreover, it is also 
anti-Serbian. If this law is adopted it will mean the unilateral 
lifting of sanctions on our part. Naturally, no one will join 
in with us. On the other hand, it will also mean the automatic 
lifting of the embargo on the delivery of weapons to Bosnia. 
This will, naturally, mean massive economic, military, and all 
sorts of other aid--a sharp increase by the Western side. Well, 
if you compare our economic potential with the West's economic 
potential, then you will understand whom this law will benefit. 
[end recording]

  [Text] Moscow, May 13 (TANJUG) -- Senior Russian Foreign 
Ministry representative on Friday assessed as a `premature step' 
the decision of the state Duma, lower house of the Russian 
Parliament, to recommend the lifting of anti-Yugoslav sanctions. 
  He told TANJUG in Moscow that Duma's move was emotional, and 
as such was no different from Thursday's proposal of the U.S. 
Senate to exempt the Bosnian Moslems from the arms embargo for 
the territory of the Former Yugoslavia. 
  `Both Russian and U.S. parliamentarians were hasty,' the 
Russian diplomat said, adding that both Duma and the U.S. Senate 
should have waited for the outcome of the ministerial meeting on 
Bosnia- Herzegovina currently underway in Geneva which gathers 
representatives of Russia, the United States, the European Union 
and the United Nations. 
  The diplomat said that both Russia and the United States 
were 
civilized countries and that they should act accordingly, that 
is to consider international law above the national. This 
practically means that the sanctions against Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) and the arms embargo including the Moslems 
should remain in force until the U.N. Security Council decides 
differently. 
  The ministry representative said that Moscow's stand towards 
the sanctions against Yugoslavia remains unchanged. The 
sanctions should be lifted totally, depending on the peace 
settlement in Bosnia, he said. 
  The U.N. Security Council in late May 1992 introduced 
comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against Yugoslavia due to 
its alleged involvement in the war in Bosnia among the local 
Serbs, Moslems and Croats. 
  The Duma on Thursday passed a bill to unilaterally lift the 
sanctions against Yugoslavia, and the U.S. Senate adopted a 
resolution which recommends the exemption of Moslems from the 
arms embargo for the former Yugoslavia, which has been in force 
since spring 1991. 
  In order to become valid, both documents need to pass two 
more steps, including obtaining the signatures of presidents of 
Russia and the United States.

  [Text] The reactions of other units located on the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia have been negative in 
contrast to that of Belgrade. Davorin (Zaberscak), counsellor 
at the Croatian embassy in Moscow, commented on the new 
situation for our radio station. 
  [Begin (Zaberscak) recording] The sanctions were adopted at 
the United Nations and Russia's representative spoke in favor of 
sanctions. Any country's parliament might make a decision on 
discontinuing support for the decision, but this decision was 
made at the international level. Sanctions can only be lifted 
at the level at which they were adopted. We believe that until 
Serbia and Montenegro recognize the borders of Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as they were before the war, borders which 
the international community and this country recognized, it will 
be difficult to talk about lifting sanctions.

  [Text] Could Russia unilaterally suspend sanctions against 
Serbia? Here is Yevgeniy Prokhorov, director of the 
International Law Department of Russia's Foreign Ministry to 
speak on this from the point of view of international law. 
  [Prokhorov] It would be quite a difficult thing to do for 
one 
simple reason: We would have to leave the United Nations. The 
decision of the Security Council is of a compulsory nature and 
applies to all states of the world, even should they disagree 
with one or another decision. Therefore it would be impossible 
to unilaterally stop implementing sanctions adopted at the 
decision of the Security Council without violating the UN 
Charter.

  [Text] Moscow is not inclined to dramatize the situation 
stemming from the American Senate's decision to recommend that 
the Clinton Administration should unilaterally lift the 
international embargo on arms supplies to the Bosnian Muslims 
imposed in 1991. "This decision is unlikely to be carried out," 
a high-ranking Russian diplomat told INTERFAX on Friday. 
  According to him, "prior to becoming a law, the Senate's 
decision must be supported by the House of Representatives." 
"And this is very problematic. But even if this happens, the 
U.S. President might use his right to veto," the diplomat said. 
  American legislators, he noted, had already decided to lift 
the embargo on arms supplies to the Bosnian Muslims previously. 
"As at that time, this may be a political declaration, rather 
than instructions for action. Under American legislation the 
international law has priority over national, and therefore the 
U.N. embargo on arms supplies to the Muslims will remain in 
force till the U.N. Security Council makes its own decision," he 
said. 
  Nevertheless, the diplomat conceded that the U.S. Senate's 
decision is not the "best gift" for the conference of the heads 
of Russian, American, British, French, Belgian, German and Greek 
diplomacies on a settlement in Bosnia which opens in Geneva on 
Friday. "The U.S. secretary of state will have to reckon with 
the senators' decision in one way or another. The only question 
is to what extent," he added. 
  According to INTERFAX's interviewee, "the political 
declaration of the U.S. Senate might give rise to some response 
in Russia's State Duma." "As regards emotions our legislators 
are not second to the American. They can be expected to decide 
to lift the sanctions imposed against Yugoslavia in the near 
future. If this happens, the State Duma decision will have the 
same fate as that of the U.S. Senate," the diplomat concluded.

  [Text] Geneva, 15 May -- "As a co-sponsor of the Middle 
East peace process, Russia favors further progress towards 
settlement," Andrey Kozyrev said in Geneva on Saturday evening, 
while receiving his Egyptian counterpart, 'Amr [Muhammad] Musa, 
at the Russian Federation permanent mission at the UN European 
branch. 
  "Many factors are prompting us to pool our efforts," the 
Russian foreign minister stressed. "Many difficulties will have 
to be overcome in order to implement the Cairo agreement between 
the Palestinians and Israel. We also have to move forward in 
the matter of Israeli-Syrian relations." 
  He went on to say that Cairo was "playing a key role in the 
Middle East process and in resolving other international 
problems." We appreciate the contribution to the Bosnian 
settlement made by such member states of the Islamic Conference 
Organization as Egypt, which has adopted a balanced and 
even-handed approach on this and other issues. 
  As to bilateral relations, Moscow is "getting ready for 
President Mubarak's visit, which will be a very important 
event." The Egyptian leader is held "in the highest esteem in 
Russia." Boris Yeltsin and Husni Mubarak keep in contact and 
exchange messages. "We are moving consistently towards a 
Russo-Egyptian summit," stressed Andrey Kozyrev. 
  "Russia plays an important role in the Middle east 
settlement 
and has the trust of many sides," noted 'Amr Muhammad Musa. 
According to him, Cairo is ready to continue helping to set up 
various meetings that can advance peace. 
  The Egyptian minister stressed the "Bosnian issue occupies 
an 
important place on our agenda." This subject was discussed at 
his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on 
Saturday.

  [Text] Moscow 13 May -- The Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea [DPRK] is for a political settlement to the nuclear 
problem on the Korean peninsula, a settlement based on the 
agreements reached with the USA, Deputy Russian Foreign Minister 
Aleksandr Panov told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today after the 
consultations between the deputy foreign ministers of Russia and 
the DPRK, which took place 12-13 May. Representing the DPRK was 
Deputy Foreign Minster Yi In-Kui. For the first time, Aleksandr 
Panov said, North Korea has stated quite firmly that it welcomes 
Russia's initiative on holding an international conference on 
security in, and a non- nuclear status for the Korean peninsula. 
Pyongyang is interested in the Russian initiative and is 
studying it. 
  The issue of the DPRK's special status in the Treaty on Non- 
Proliferation of nuclear weapons could give rise, and is giving 
rise, to some concern, since this path could in the end damage 
the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons regime. The Russian 
side took account of this during the political consultations, 
Russia's deputy foreign minister said. 
  North Korea said it did not want to drag out its term under 
this status, but wanted to settle the problem. 
  Moscow expressed its concern at the situation that has 
developed with the armistice -- in existence since 1953 -- now 
that the DPRK has decided to give up this whole system and start 
direct talks with the USA. 
  Pyongyang explained the situation by saying this system is 
not operating anyway and is even being used to hide a build-up 
of American military presence in South Korea.

  [Text] Moscow, 13 May -- Russia and the DPRK favor boosting 
bilateral links, including political contacts, Aleksandr Panov, 
Russian Federation deputy foreign minister, told ITAR-TASS 
today, after the end of political consultations at the level of 
deputy heads of foreign departments of Russia and the DPRK. The 
North Korean side advocated, inter alia, Russia's participation 
in the Rajin-Sonbong free economic zone, as well as cooperation 
in Siberia and in the Russian Far East. Both sides stated both 
countries' economic potential should be put to better use. 
  Moscow and Pyongyang said a new agreement on the 
participation of the North Korean side in logging in the Russian 
east should be signed as soon as possible. North Korean workers 
staying on the Russian territory should abide by the Russian 
law. Both sides acknowledge the need for creating better living 
conditions for them, said the Russian deputy foreign minister. 
  The consultations between Aleksandr Panov and his North 
Korean counterpart Yi In-Kui took place in Moscow on Thursday 
and Friday.

  According to A. Kozyrev, relations with Argentina are an 
important element of the development of the new Russia's

  [Text] Luedwigsburg May 13 TASS -- "We have managed to 
reach an agreement on all economic issues," said Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin at a final news conference. 
  "During a meeting with leading representatives of the German 
economy we discussed concrete principles of relations between 
Russia and Germany in this field and major joint strategic 
projects. Isn't Germany interested in the construction of an 
automobile highway Moscow-Berlin, to be paid for? Or isn't the 
construction of a new high-speed railway Moscow Berlin 
interesting?" Yeltsin said. 
  "Taking into account that today's meeting was attended by 
prominent representatives of all branches of the German economy, 
we outlined immediate tasks not only for today or tomorrow, but 
for a period after the year 2000. The people of Russia and 
Germany will be the first to benefit from it," Yeltsin said. 
  Commenting on political results of the visit, Yeltsin 
pointed 
out that the withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany on August 
31 will herald a new era in Russo-German relations -- the era of 
reconciliation. "Festivities on the occasion of the troops 
withdrawal will take place in Berlin, which will set the minds 
of our society at rest. Several months later in Weimar, we 
shall arrange a joint cultural festival, inviting best Russian 
composers, writers, poets and ensembles. Let us make it a great 
cultural holiday," Yeltsin said. 
  He expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome given to him 
by the government of Baden-Wurttemberg, its Prime Minister Erwin 
Teufel whom Yeltsin had invited to visit Russia. 
  "I am leaving Germany with good and friendly feelings. We 
are crossing out the word "war" from our relations and from 
German and Russian dictionaries," the Russian president said in 
conclusion.

  [Text] At this moment President Boris Yeltsin of Russia is 
due to fly back to Moscow from Stuttgart. His official visit to 
Germany has ended. Our correspondents report on the last day of 
the trip: 
  [Begin recording] [Kondratyev] The German mass media are 
today using more complimentary than critical language about the 
results of the Russian president's talks in Bonn and the 
chancellor's home region. The last day of the visit, just as 
the previous day, began with political discussions. Klaus 
Kinkel, the German foreign minister and chairman of the FDP 
[Free Democratic Party], part of the ruling coalition, arrived 
for a joint luncheon with Yeltsin at Petersberg, where the guest 
is staying. It is Kinkel's Foreign Ministry that will have to 
implement the chancellor's promises to Yeltsin, on Russian 
membership of GATT and a number of European Union organizations, 
full membership of G-7, and signing of a separate protocol on 
Russia's special status in NATO's Partnership for Peace. 
Russia, for its part, supports the FRG's efforts to become a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  Kinkel told us after the talks that the two sides also 
discussed the role Russia and Germany could play in a Bosnian 
peace settlement. Kinkel, who is taking part in the work of the 
joint commission on return of art treasures, was not very happy 
about Russia's inflexibility over the return of works of art 
captured during World War II. Fearing charges of unpatriotic 
behavior, our country is not even prepared at the moment to 
honor its promise to hand over the Gotha Library, which is 
chiefly of significance to Germans. 
  [Kondratyev, addressing Yeltsin] Boris Nikolayevich, how do 
you evaluate the results of your talks with the German leaders? 
  [Yeltsin] All the issues that we had planned to discuss were 
discussed. We have not lost out on a single question. 
  [Kondratyev] From Bonn Yeltsin flew to Stuttgart, which he 
first visited in 1991. No doubt the warm reception that he 
received then made such an impact on the president that he 
decided to visit his friends in Baden-Wuerttemberg again. From 
Stuttgart, Boris Yeltsin will return to Moscow. He has reason 
to be satisfied with his meetings on German soil. Germany, as 
was repeatedly stressed during the visit, is Russia's main 
partner on the European continent. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 13 TASS -- Japan imposes nuclear game 
rules on the world while accusing Russia of developing new 
weapon types, concluded Russian experts when 70 kilos of 
unregistered plutonium were founded in reactors of a Japanese 
splitting fuel plant at the Tokai-Mura Nuclear Center. 
  Seventy kilos are enough to make eight nuclear warheads. 
Specialists put into question Japanese claims that the pure 
plutonium powder "stuck" to the equipment and pipes. 
  While storing unregistered raw materials for nuclear bombs 
Japan continues to spread sensational rumors on Russian 
development of a new small-size neutron bomb on the basis of red 
mercury. It gives the new bomb's parameters -- a size of a 
coffee cup, and address and possibilities of its use -- Bosnia, 
a terror weapon. 
  In the opinion of experts, this is done to conceal Japanese 
secret nuclear activities. According to IAEA norms, eight kilos 
of plutonium are enough to make a bomb and dangerous for non- 
proliferation of nuclear arms. 
  The revealed materials make one doubt "full transparency of 
the plutonium peace use programs" against the background of 
Japanese claims it is a model state in the sphere of nuclear 
control, said the experts. 
  This opinion is confirmed by a classified report of the U.S. 
Institute for Control over Nuclear Materials submitted to the 
U.S. secretary of state. Some paragraphs of the report have 
leaked and were used by the press. 
  Deputy head of the Russian Ministry for Nuclear Power 
Engineering's Information and Public Relations Department 
Vitaliy Nasonov told ITAR-TASS the report on Japanese plutonium 
requires more studies, as it is hard to reveal the plutonium 
source.

  [Text] Moscow May 13 TASS -- The Russian Federation and the 
Republic of Crimea signed an agreement on trade and economic 
cooperation in the building of the Russian Government on Friday. 
  The agreement was signed following talks between Russian 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the Crimean Vice-Premier 
Yevgeniy Saburov. This is a framework agreement laying a 
foundation to the restoration of close trade and economic 
cooperation between Russian and Crimean enterprises and 
partners. The agreement was sighed by the Vice-Premier of the 
Russian Government Sergey Shakhray and his Crimean counterpart, 
Yevgeniy Saburov. 
  "We are considerably falling behind Ukraine which has 
already 
established trade and economic cooperation with a number of 
subjects of the Russian Federation and signed the necessary 
documents," Shakhray told journalists upon completion of the 
signing ceremony. The agreement, drawn in strict conformity with 
Ukrainian laws, will make it clear both to residents of Russia 
and Ukraine that their governments have embarked upon the course 
of close cooperation, shakhray said. 
  For his part, Saburov said that the signed document lifts 
the 
problem of mutual payments and many other unjustified barriers 
which existed for Russian and Crimean trade and economic 
partners and those wishing to have a rest in the former Soviet 
resort region. 
  As for holiday makers, the Crimean Government reached an 
oral 
agreement with Kiev on considerably facilitating a customs 
inspection procedure for those arriving in the Crimea. The 
Crimean vice-premier pointed out that it is too early yet to 
speak about the Crimea joining the rouble zone. However, he 
invited all those wishing to have a rest in the Crimea to visit 
Crimean resorts, adding that they will feel comfortable there 
with "Russian roubles."

  [Text] Chilean Air Force Brigadier General Gonzalo 
Miranda, commander of the Santiago air force district, was in 
Russia for a working visit. He was received by Colonel General 
Petr Deynekin, commander in chief of the Russian Federation Air 
Force. The Chilean guest visited the Gagarin cosmonaut training 
center located in Zvezdnyy Gorodok. There he looked at the 
simulators used by cosmonauts preparing for their flight, and 
had a discussion with Lieutenant General Petr Klimuk, chief of 
the center. 
  Gen. Gonzalo Miranda confirmed that the possibility of 
purchasing Russian-made war planes, which are to replace the 
obsolete British planes, is currently being studied. But the 
final solution of the question and setting aside of the required 
funds for purchasing is up to the Chilean Government. Gen. 
Gonzalo Miranda was rather optimistic about prospects for 
Chile-Russia cooperation in the sphere of outer space. He 
pointed out that in our day and age there are actual 
possibilities for developing joint projects and their 
implementation in the interests of both countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "MiGs Contract Ready But It </F>
Will Not Be Signed Tomorrow"] 
  [Text] In yesterday's issue of IZVESTIYA our Washington 
correspondent, citing a statement by Arkadiy VOlskiy, reported 
that Oleg Soskovets, first vice premier of the Russian 
Government, had not arrived in the U.S. capital as planned to 
open an exhibition of progressive technology because he had 
flown to Malaysia to sign a contract for MiG-29 fighters. 
  According to information I received from confidential 
sources, the vice premier is still in Moscow. The 
Russian-Malaysian contract for the sale of 18 light Mig-29 
front-line fighter is indeed already ready and has been agreed 
by the participants in talks but it is to be signed in the near 
future, in the summer. A few details have to be sorted out. 
  These details concern in particular the palm oil consignment 
which will go to pay for our aircraft. As we know, when he was 
vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy visited Malaysia and suggested 
selling our MiGs in practice mainly for palm oil. But the 
Russian Government rejected such terms for a contract and 
insisted on the currency equivalent. Now there is a decision. 
It remains to be approved. 
  It is true that at the Malaysian side's request our aircraft 
builders embarked on unprecedented innovations in equipping the 
Russian fighter. Thus, the aircraft delivered to Kuala Lumpur 
will have installed on them "Takan" close-range navigation 
receivers which operate in tandem with the U.S. ground station 
produced by the same firm. The MiGs are being further equipped 
with "Collins" radio stations operating on the emergency 
frequencies used in Southeast Asia. The fighter will acquire 
the GPS-21 satellite navigation system which can get their 
bearings equally well from Russian and U.S. satellite signals. 
  At the Malaysians' request all instruments on our aircraft 
will be recalibrated from meters and kilometers to feet and 
miles, which are used in that country. The Malaysian military 
pilots will train at our air force bases and in flying 
academies. And most important Russia for the first time 
together with Malaysia is creating a fundamentally new subunit 
there to service aircraft -- the technical service center, which 
will be able to help not only Malaysian military aircraft but 
also the fighter aircraft of other states. 
  In the opinion of the exporters of our aviation equipment 
all 
this additional equipping of Russian fighter aircraft will help 
them integrate more easily with the ground-based airfield 
services of the Malaysian Air Force and will ensure their easier 
introduction into existing infrastructures and will consequently 
make the purchase of such aircraft cheaper and more accessible. 
  Our MiGs have been the basic aircraft in this region only in 
India and Vietnam so far. Now, after the signing of the 
contract with Malaysia, it is not ruled out that the Russian 
combat aircraft will appear in other Southeast Asian countries. 
  This breakthrough to new arms markets previously closed to 
Russia is regarded by specialists as a very great gain for 
Russian exporters of combat equipment.

"Into Whose Hands Does the Withdrawal of the 14th Army Play? 
Attitude to Russian Troops in Moldova May Change in the Most 
Unpredictable Way"] 
  [Text] During festivities held in Tiraspol on the occasion 
of Victory Day, the Dniester Region leaders pointedly distanced 
themselves from the command of the 14th Army. Igor Smirnov, 
president of the Dniester Region Moldovan Republic, departed 
from the city's central square after laying flowers and making a 
brief address to the veterans, leaving it to General Aleksandr 
Lebed and his subordinates to take charge of the conduct of the 
celebration -- something the Russian soldiers did a good job of. 
  This public demonstration of hostility has effectively been 
precipitated by the general context of relations between the 
Dniester Region leaders and the 14th Army command, which have 
recently been described as woefully bad. Judging by some 
indicators, the Dniester Region leaders, having soberly weighed 
all the "pros" and "cons" regarding the presence of the Russian 
troops in the region, are inclined to think that their 
withdrawal will only be welcome. After recent political 
breakthroughs toward the final settlement of the Dniester Region 
crisis, the Tiraspol authorities, who formerly prayed for the 
14th Army as their sole guardian, are no longer attaching 
crucial importance to this function of the Russian troops. 
Moreover, the republic itself presently has its own armed 
forces that are fully capable of dealing with the potential 
adversary -- the Moldovan Army. The decrease in the 14th Army's 
strategic importance in the view of Dniester Region leaders has 
brought its political role in the region to the foreground. 
This role, given the well-known stance of Gen. Aleksandr Lebed, 
who, as people here believe, has powerful circles in Moscow 
behind him, does not suit Tiraspol at all. The line pursued by 
the 14th Army commander during the past 18 months has been aimed 
at replacing the current ruling elite of the Dniester Region 
Moldovan Republic with more liberal leaders capable of striking 
a compromise with Moldova. The peculiarity of the political 
situation in the Dniester Region is that the 14th Army command 
is the sole serious opposition to the Tiraspol regime. Its 
political satellites from among local opposition figures wield 
little clout and do not pose any independent threat to the 
authorities. This is why the removal of Gen. Lebed from the 
Dniester Region is seen by some Tiraspol politicians as a fairly 
acceptable option. Moreover, the issue is precisely the 
withdrawal of the army, not just the replacement of its 
commander, because in the latter case Aleksandr Lebed will be 
replaced by another general with similar instructions. 
Suggestions that the 14th Army commander's 18-month revolt 
might be an independent action have long lost credibility with 
anyone here. 
  What is interesting in this situation is Chisinau's stance. 
They are fully aware there that as of today Gen. Lebed is the 
sole force that can weaken the current orthodox Tiraspol 
authorities, if not topple them altogether. Upon the withdrawal 
of the 14th Army from the Dniester Region, the chances of the 
local opposition will be brought to nil, and the positions of 
Igor Smirnov and Co. will receive a significant boost. The 
latter is unlikely to please the Moldovan leaders, particularly 
on the eve of an extremely difficult and prolonged stage of 
detailed negotiations on the final settlement of the Dniester 
Region problem. Therefore, the current political alignment 
suggests that they in Chisinau are objectively interested in 
having the 14th Army stay on. That this is not idle talk was 
proved by the fact that in the recent Moldovan-Dniester 
Region-Russian talks the question of withdrawing the 14th Army 
was not even raised.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kucherenko report: "Dangerous to Society! Moscow </F>
Mayor Forms 5,000-Strong Army. People's Militiamen or 
Stormtroopers?"] 
  [Text] The report of the formation of people's militias in 
the capital has provoked a contradictory reaction. Many people 
are at a loss as to exactly how to view this step by Yu. 
Luzhkov, the capital's mayor. 
  Judging by the Moscow government's decree of 19 April, 
something akin to an army is being formed, but without combat 
weapons. A blue uniform, bulletproof vests, helmets, handcuffs, 
and batons [sentence as published]. 
  Detachments are to be deployed in each of the city's 133 
administrative districts (prefectures). A distinction is being 
drawn between territorial and mobile forces (operational 
detachments), which could be attached to a city detachment. 
  E. Bakirov, vice premier in Luzhkov's government, has been 
made commander of the "blue army." The latter is also 
appointing the leadership of a city staff for the people's 
militiamen. The government is funding these forces through its 
own finance department, and the transport department is 
supplying them with automobiles and fuel. 
  Anyone who served in the USSR MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] Internal Troops will see parallels when glancing at the 
statute on these formations. Personnel are paid for their 
service. They can check documents, detain people, and 
collaborate with Federal Counterintelligence Service forces, and 
they will be trained by specialists from the city staff for 
civil defense and emergency situations. They can be used in 
operations to maintain order. And, let us observe, the decree 
was even sent to the capital's military commandant for 
compliance. The numerical strength of the people's militias is 
being estimated at a minimum of 3,000 and a maximum of 
5,000-6,000 men. 
  Of course, crime has to be combated and order maintained. 
But this must be done only according to the law. And there is 
no law on people's militias. Is the innovation by the capital's 
top brass consequently illegal? It turns out that it is in fact 
forming its own structure of repression which is subordinate to 
Luzhkov. (This is in addition to the forces of the Internal 
Affairs Main Administration and municipal militia, which are 
already subordinate to him). But if there are normative acts 
which regulate the activity of both militiamen and security 
firms' employees and which allow someone who has suffered at 
their hands to defend their rights in court, what is to be done 
here? After all, it is impossible to take to court a force 
which does not figure in the laws. This could lead to 
large-scale tyranny. 
  Generally there is no understanding of what a "people's 
militia" actually is. In the West there are people who 
voluntarily assist the police. But their function is to report 
disturbances by radio and telephone. Although they are paid, 
this is still a form of amateur civilian activity. But a de 
facto police body with the attributes of a standing army is 
being set up from the top in Moscow under City Hall and the 
prefectures. The Moscow government will maintain it and appoint 
and remove its command personnel. It is not a people's but a 
government militia! 
  Would it not be better if it were designed to protect the 
security of citizens and strengthen legal militia structures 
consisting of professionals, not amateurs? 
  Thus, the formation of the "blue army" in Moscow is 
illegal, a burden on the treasury, and senseless from the 
viewpoint of maintaining law and order. But it does strengthen 
the personal power of Mr. Luzhkov, who, as mayor and head of the 
city government, already manages the 9-million-strong city's 
land, buildings, property, budget, and tax service practically 
unchecked. He is just like the Prince of Moscow. 
Notwithstanding the fact that Russian laws do not contain the 
concepts of a "mayor," "prefect," or "head of the city 
government." This also violates the treaty on social accord, 
which prohibits the creation of militarized formations. The 
mayor has successfully gotten around this by using Khrushchev's 
old pretext of a "people's militia." 
  This is very reminiscent of the formation of Nazi 
stormtrooper detachments. And Napoleon III, in order to 
suppress the people, formed "garde mobile" detachments from 
declasse elements. Of the kind, let us observe, of which 
present-day Moscow is chock full, including people from the 
so-called "near abroad" countries. Apart from them, various 
political militants and criminal groupings currently 
masquerading as security firms are sure to rush in closed ranks 
into the power structure to which the city authority has given 
its blessing. 
  In general, there are grounds for concern. Security firms' 
employees have already been used in 1992 to evict residents of a 
block on Taganka when it was handed over to the "Khoreks [as 
transliterated] Center" joint enterprise, in which the city 
government has a share of the profits. The same year a 
federation of young law-enforcement clubs tried to seize the 
Oktyabrskiy Rayon Soviet building by agreement with the Central 
Administrative District prefect. Security firms have been used 
many times as "forceful arguments" in disputes over premises. 
What will the formation of "gardes mobiles" under the 
prefectures bring? In October 1992 similar internal affairs 
main administration forces cleared a block in Nagatino of the 
large families which were occupying it. 
  So it would be better if Mr. Luzhkov did not break the law. 
He has more than enough power as it is.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz May 13 TASS -- "The multinational people 
of the North Ossetian Republic cannot imagine its present and 
future outside Russia. Two hundred and twenty years ago our 
wise ancestors decided that their people will live within 
Russia," says an appeal to the North Ossetian people signed 
today by North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov and 
Parliament Speaker Yuriy Biragov on behalf of the North Ossetian 
Government and the Supreme Soviet. 
  The appeal lays down the basis to implement the Civic Accord 
Agreement signed in Moscow on April 28, 1994. 
  "Today we call on our compatriots to work together to 
achieve 
comprehensive accord and stop devastating processes in our 
multinational society, put Ossetia on the path of peace and 
creation, consolidation of unity and might of great Russia," 
says the document. 
  The president told the signing ceremony that the appeal is 
the first step to implement the Civic Accord idea in the

"Mordovia Supreme Soviet Ignores President Yeltsin's Edict. 
Federal Commission at Work in Saransk"] 
  [Text] The Republic of Mordovia Supreme Soviet is dragging 
its feet on reforming organs of representative power in the 
republic in violation of President Boris Yeltsin's edict. In 
February 1994, the 17th session of the Supreme Soviet called 
elections for the State Assembly for 5 June, which is clearly 
beyond the president's deadline. The next session set 27 
November as a new election date. Next the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium, clearly ignoring Boris Yeltsin's edict on reforming 
local self-government, passed a decision on resuming the 
operation of rayon and town Soviets of People's Deputies. Nor 
would Supreme Soviet deputies heed the opinion of the 
prosecutor's office and the government of the republic. 
  A commission set up by Boris Yeltsin's directive is 
currently 
working in Mordovia. It is composed of officers of the Main 
State Legal Administration and of the president's staff 
administration for work with territories, the Ministry for 
Nationalities Affairs, and the Russian Federation Central 
Electoral Commission. Mr. Stepanov, Russian Federation deputy 
justice minister, has been appointed the commission's chairman. 
The commission is supposed to establish to what extent the 
legal acts passed by Mordovia's parliament correspond with the 
Russian Federation Constitution. The Commission has met with 
Supreme Soviet deputies, Mr. Guslyannikov and members of his 
former cabinet, heads of rayon administrations, leaders of 
parties and movements, and candidates nominated for Mordovia's 
State Assembly.

  [Text] Tatarstan is seeking to be the leader in Russia's 
regional policy, Tatar Vice-President Vasily Likhachev told 
Interfax. He said that the bilateral agreement on cooperation 
with neighboring Chuvashia signed in Kazan on May 13, the first 
after the signing of a treaty with Russia on division of powers, 
proves this aspiration of Tatarstan. 
  Likhachev said that both Chuvashia and Tatarstan thus state 
their serious intention to continue the process of internal 
reform in Russia "according to the will of peoples and from 
inside." He noted that "although it is a bilateral agreement, 
there is the third party -- Russia." 
  According to Likhachev, the document signed in Kazan for the 
first time raises the problem of ensuring human rights 
regardless of nationality. Besides, the text includes an 
article taken from the practice of inter-government relations, 
i.e. the commitment of the sides to refrain from actions 
inflicting political, economic, ecological damage, etc. To each 
other." [quotation marks as received] 
  The Tatar-Chuvash agreement is unique because it enables the 
republic to grant legal aid to Tatar prisoners serving terms in 
Chuvashia, Likhachev added. He explained that under the treaty 
with the Russian Federation the Tatar president was given the 
right to mercy.

<F P=106> [Comments by V. Zakharov, chairman of the Economic Committee </F>
of the Kaliningrad Oblast Administration; place and date not 
given: "Oblast Economy Is in Alarming Situation" -- first two 
paragraphs are YANTARNYY KRAY introduction published in boldface] 
  [Text] The results of the social and economic 
development of our oblast in the first quarter of 1994 have been 
summarized. 
  We have asked V. Zakharov, chairman of the Economic 
Committee of the Kaliningrad Oblast Administration, to comment 
on those results and make a prognosis for the near future. 
  "Comparing the situation in our oblast with that of the 
northwestern region of Russia (Pskov, Novgorod, and Leningrad 
Oblasts), it is worth noting that we achieved better results in 
the production of consumer goods, in the volume of retail 
commodity circulation, in cargo shipments, and in the financial 
situation of enterprises. Also, Kaliningrad Oblast, in 
comparison with Russia as a whole and with the above-mentioned 
region, has a lower inflation rate. True, the situation in our 
agricultural sector is worse. 
  "It should be said straightforwardly -- the social and 
economic situation in our oblast is complex, contradictory, and 
extremely unstable. In spite of this, we have been able to 
reduce the rate of consumer price increases from 15-16 percent, 
in the first quarter of 1993, to 10-12 percent in the first 
quarter of 1994. The production of sausage, cheese, whole-milk 
products, and margarine has also increased. Taking into account 
the cost of 19 basic foodstuffs in April, Kaliningrad occupies 
69th place among over 120 Russian cities. Over 45,000 
apartments were privatized by our residents. We have more than 
700 joint ventures with a total capital of 6.5 million Russian 
rubles [R]. 
  "Along with this, industrial production, as compared to that 
in the corresponding period of 1993, dropped 41 percent. The 
slump in the fuel industry amounted to 8 percent; the food 
industry -- 17; electricity production -- 22; building materials 
-- 47; pulp-and-paper industry -- 48; light industry -- 58; and 
machine-building -- 78. The smallest drop was registered in 
those branches which satisfy the needs for electricity, fuel, 
and food. The other branches of the national economy suffered 
an unprecedented drop in production. 
  "The main problems in industry and other branches of the 
national economy, as well as in the entire sphere of material 
production, are the following: a crisis in the realization of 
products, curtailment of manufacturing or undertaking 
activities, nonpayments, a high level of hidden unemployment, 
and inflation. The reduction of jobs should be specified 
separately. At certain enterprises, jobs were reduced by 22-43 
percent. This refers especially to the machine-building sector. 
At the same time, the number of jobs increased at 
`Kaliningradmorneftegas,' the `Pregol' ship-repair yard, 
`AGA-GAS' joint stock companies, and `Yantarenergo.' Employment 
also increased at enterprises in the building, butter- and 
cheese-processing, milk-processing, and chemical industries. 
Thus, a tendency toward transferring labor from one enterprise 
to another has begun to show. Still -- and I will repeat myself 
-- the general situation in unemployment is very serious. At 
the current time, unemployment benefits are being paid to 6,500 
people. 
  "An alarming situation can also be seen in the agricultural 
sector. The number of livestock decreased by 12 percent, the 
production of meat -- by 22 percent. For example, in 
Krasnoznamensk and Chernyakhovsk rayons, the production of meat 
dropped by over 40 percent. Last year's level of production was 
only preserved in Gusev and Bagrationovsk rayons. The 
production of milk in the first quarter of 1994, as compared to 
that of the corresponding period last year, dropped by 24 
percent. Difficult problems are also facing the 1994 harvest. 
As of the middle of April, it was necessary to sow over 100,000 
hectares of farmland, including winter crops. 
  "Briefly about the financial situation of enterprises. The 
cost effectiveness in industry amounted only to 17.5 percent. 
Notwithstanding the fact that this index is higher than the 
average for Russia, enterprises -- due to inflation -- will fail 
to reach the break-even point. Their debt liabilities amount to 
R130 billion and in credits -- R144 billion (as of 1 April). At 
the same time, various financial operations carried out by 
enterprises involve over R15 billion, which is not connected 
with basic production activities. As of 1 April, the debts of 
agricultural enterprises to banks amounted to R13 billion. At 
the same time, significant sums are owed to agricultural 
producers by the food-processing industry. 
  "Now, about the prognosis for the next three months and the 
half year as a whole. The main problems in the branches of 
material production will remain the same as before: sales, 
nonpayments, a high level of hidden unemployment, lack of 
turnover means, and halts in production at enterprises. 
Disruptions in paying wages and a growing tendency toward 
barter deals will follow. A fall in industrial production will 
continue. If the problem of nonpayments is resolved by some 
means, a certain surge in production may be expected. The 
volume of agricultural production will be around 10-15 percent 
lower than last year. 
  "The oblast budget will suffer with ever-increasing 
expenditures connected with the increase in enrollment of the 
housing sector as well as facilities of social and cultural 
sphere on the balance sheets of municipalities. Real incomes of 
the population, as it seems, will be reduced by 10-15 percent in 
comparison with the first quarter of 1994. A share of expenses 
for municipal services and foodstuffs will increase in the 
structure of consumption. An increase in consumer prices will 
continue. The inflation rate at the end of May and in 
June-July, in my opinion, will amount to 15-20 percent due to 
the lack of state credits and repayments of debts to the state. 
However, there is a danger in that. If the experience with the 
reckoning of nonpayments and currency emissions is to be 
repeated, the inflation rate in the third quarter may reach 
45-50 percent.

  [Text] Stepanakert ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 05/13/94 -- 
Having signed the cease-fire agreement, Azerbaijan continues 
carrying military operations in the zone of Karabakh conflict. 
  The Azeri Armed Forces attempted to break the Karabakh 
defense positions in the Agdamskiy District at 0700 early in the 
morning of 12 May. The Azeris involved 500 infantry, four T-72 
tanks and three personnel carriers, attacking in the direction 
of the village of Hovsepavan (Yusifdzhanli). According to the 
RMK Defense Army Headquarters, the enemy was forced to retreat 
with great manpower and equipment losses. According to 
preliminary information, 35 Azeri soldiers were killed, eight 
Karabakh fighters injured. 
  No significant changes of the front line were registered by 
1700. Only positional shellings were reported. 
  Battles at the northern section of the front continue too. 
The Azeri troops commenced several offensives in the 
Mardakertskiy District, particularly in the direction of the 
village of Leninavan. The enemy offensive was successfully 
repulsed. 
  The RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] military 
reconnaissance reports significant concentration of the Azeri 
forces at the north of the Mardakertskiy District, particularly 
in the environs of the villages of Talysh and Seisulan. 
  At the same time the Azeri Defense Ministry reports, the 
Armenian units commenced an extensive offensive in the direction 
of the Azeri positions in the Mardakertskiy and Agdamskiy 
Districts. 
  An Azeri prisoner Melik Yakhiaev of Ujan district reported, 
the Azeri command issued a secret order to establish a special 
control over non-Azeri units fighting at the front, particularly 
over Lezgins and Avars. Most worries are caused by Avar units 
in the Belokan and Zakatala districts [last three placenames as 
received], who have to fight in the most dangerous sections of 
the front. "Jimahagh" ("People") National Liberation Movement 
of Avars is becoming very popular in the mentioned districts. 
"Jimahagh"s goal is to join the Zakatala and Belokan district 
to Dagestan.

  [Excerpts] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the 
latest incidents in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the 
border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. [passage omitted] 
  Although Azerbaijan signed the agreement for a cease-fire, 
it 
has violated the agreement several times. The NKR Defense Army 
Headquarters Press Service has informed us that fighting 
continued yesterday in Agdamskiy and Mardakertskiy Rayons. 
Azerbaijan's military forces tried to penetrate the NKR defense 
positions to reach Yusifdzhanly in Agdamskiy Rayon; however, the 
defense units counterattacked. The enemy forces lost several 
men and were forced to retreat to their former positions. 
  The NKR military subunits have succeeded in obstructing 
several attacks in the northern and northeastern part of 
Mardakertskiy Rayon. The Azerbaijan Military Command 
Headquarters is trying to amass several units in those areas at 
the present time. 
  Azerbaijan's military units fired on Vartashen in 
Martuninskiy Rayon with Grad rocket launchers the night before 
last night. Initial reports said two women were killed and 10 
residents were wounded. The attack also caused material damage. 
  No incidents have taken place in the border region between 
Armenia and Azerbaijan during the past few days. [passage 
omitted] 
  However, the Armenian Ministry of Defense Press Center has 
disclosed that the military units in Azerbaijan and the 
Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic [NAR] violated the cease-fire 
agreement in the northeastern and southeastern sectors of 
Armenia's border last night. Azerbaijan's units in 
Kyzylgadzhyly in Kazakhskiy Rayon fired on [place name 
indistinct] and Bekaber in Idzhevanskiy Rayon with mortars, 
tanks, and machine guns from 1920 to 2300 last night. The enemy 
units in the NAR fired on [place name indistinct] in Sisianskiy 
Rayon with machine guns from 2230 to 0100. Several people were 
wounded in the attack. Our border guards remained committed to 
the cease-fire agreement and refrained from launching 
retaliatory operations. 
  The same source disclosed that no other incidents occurred 
in 
the border region between last night and this morning.

  [Text] Stepanakert ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 05/14/94 -- 
Tension at the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] fronts 
persists. In spite of the new cease fire agreement, the Azeri 
units continue the attacks at the northern and eastern sections 
of the front. 
  The RMK Defense Army headquarters report, military 
operations 
in the environs of the village of Yusifdzhanli in the Agdamskiy 
District continued in the evening of 12 May. The Azeri units 
attacked the Armenian defense positions, but were forced to 
retreat to the initial positions. About 50 Azeri soldiers were 
killed. 
  The RMK armed forces repulsed the Azeri offensive in the 
Seisulan-Karmiravan section in the Mardakertskiy District. 
According to the RMK reconnaissance, the enemy continues 
concentrating new forces in this direction. 
  The enemy shelled the village of Berdavan in the 
Martuninskiy 
District in the evening of 12 May, using "Grad" installations 
stationed in the Agdamskiy and Agdzhabediskiy districts. 
According to preliminary information, two women were killed, 
more than 10 peaceful inhabitants injured. Significant property 
damage is reported. 
  The situation was rather calm on 13 May, only positional 
shellings are reported. 
  An RMK Defense Army representative Serge Arushanyan said the 
Azeri side is violating the new cease-fire agreement, and thus 
challenging not only Karabakh but also Russia and CSCE, 
attempting to fail their efforts on peaceful regulation of the 
conflict.

  [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "AZG", "HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN" 
dailies), 05/13/94 -- Russian President's Special Envoy 
Kazimirov visited Baku, presented the Russian project of 
resolving the Karabakh conflict and met the journalists. The 
meeting was probably organized in order to respond to the Azeri 
Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov's criticism regarding the new 
Russian project. 
  Gasanov disagreed with the Russian plan saying that after 
its 
implementation Azerbaijan will loose the control over military 
units in Karabakh. Kazimirov responded to this declaration with 
a rhetorical question: "Is Azerbaijan able to control the 
military operations in Karabakh?" 
  Kazimirov stressed, several countries are hindering the 
implementation of the Russian peace plan. 
  Yesterday evening Kazimirov and the CSCE Minsk group 
Chairman 
Jan Eliasson arrived from Baku to Yerevan. They were planning 
to leave for Stepanakert today. 
  RA [Republic of Armenia] President Levon Ter-Petrosyan 
accepted V. Kazimirov, J. Eliasson and Minsk Group's deputy 
chairman M. Mosberg on 13 May and discussed the problems in 
establishing a cease-fire in the conflict zone. 
  RA Minister of Foreign Affairs Vahan Papazyan, Special Envoy 
of the RA President David Shakhnazaryan, First Deputy Minister 
of Foreign Affairs Jirayr Liparityan participated in the meeting.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>
  [Text] Yerevan, 14 May -- The Armenian Foreign Ministry is 
pinning certain hopes on the new visit to the region by a 
delegation of the Minsk group of the CSCE, adviser to the 
Armenian Foreign Minister Aram Safaryan told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent on Friday [13 May] evening. In his opinion, the 
visit demonstrates an increased interest by the international 
community in the settlement of the Karabakh problem. 
  The Armenian spokesman thinks it is indicative that for the 
last two and a half years Vladimir Kazimirov, plenipotentiary 
representative of the Russian president, has arrived as a member 
of the CSCE mission. Armenia would like to see in this joint 
mission the symbol of expanding cooperation between the CSCE and 
Russia in uniting initiatives in the interests of the settlement 
of the Karabakh conflict, Aram Safaryan said. 
  It is absolutely obvious, he thinks, that the degree of 
hostility between the conflicting parties requires an adequate 
interference by international authorities who have weight and 
influence on the conflicting parties. 
  We think, the Armenian spokesman continued, that Russia is 
the only country at present that will agree to have a contingent 
of peace-making forces in the conflict region to disengage the 
forces. He said not only Russia but also some other countries 
could participate in the contingent and admitted that it was 
obvious that the willingness and readiness of Russia alone to 
resolve the conflict was not enough. Without such organizations 
as the United Nations and CSCE, it is difficult to imagine a 
comprehensive and long-term settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh, 
Safaryan said.

once again unable to fly out to Stepanakert for talks with the

decision was taken today to hold the meeting between Jan 
Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group and Vladimir 
Kazimirov, plenipotentiary representative of the Russian 
president, and the leadership of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic

  [Text] Well-informed sources in Yerevan told INTERFAX that 
the Armenian and Azeri Defense Ministers and the commander of 
the Karabakh defense forces would be meeting in Moscow under the 
mediation of the Russian Defense Minister on 16 May. 
  Serge Sarakissyan, Mamedrafi Mamedov, Samvel Babayan and 
Pavel Grachev will be expected to confirm agreements negotiated 
on 18 February in Moscow and on 4 and 5 May, under the mediation 
of the Commonwealth's Interparliamentary Assembly, in Bishkek. 
  Armenian Deputy Defense Minister Asvatsatur Petrossyan told 
newsmen in Yerevan on 14 May that within three days a peace 
agreement would be signed to put an end, as early as this year, 
to the war in Karabakh. 
  According to Petrossyan, the Moscow meeting of the defense 
ministers and the commander of the Karabakh defense forces would 
concentrate on the scheduled introduction and deployment of a 
peacekeeping contingent in the area of the Armenian-Azeri 
conflict. 
  Petrossyan said Armenia would welcome the introduction of 
Russian peacekeepers into the disputed area. 
  He said that in the past five months 50 Azeri POW's and 
hostages had been exchanged for 25 Armenians. He said as many 
as 180 Armenians were listed as missing. Some 10 to 15 percent 
of these, he said, were civilians taken by Azeris off passenger 
trains. 
  Petrossyan denied rumors on the existence of POW 
concentration camps in Armenia.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Vadim Byrkin and Tigran </F>
Liloyan] 
  [Text] Yerevan, 15 May -- During consultations with the 
leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and also Nagornyy Karabakh 
[Nagorno-Karabakh], representatives of Russia and the CSCE 
proposed that the cease-fire agreement that was reached should 
be strengthened by giving it an appropriate formula which, in 
particular, provided for the stationing of international 
observers, according to a report for the press that was 
communicated to the ITAR-TASS correspondents here. 
  Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov, plenipotentiary 
representative 
of the president of Russia in Nagornyy Karabakh, and Jan 
Eliasson, spokesman for the CSCE Minsk conference, who are 
touring the region of the conflict, also expressed satisfaction 
that the cease-fire agreement that was reached on 12 May between 
the defense ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and the commander 
of the Army of Nagornyy Karabakh, with the mediation of Russia 
and the CSCE, had led to a decline in combat activity.

  [Text] Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisyan met Aide 
of the U.S. State Secretary for Coordination on Affairs of the 
CIS new independent states, James Collins, in Yerevan on 14 May. 
They discussed guarantees for security of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
population and the stages for establishment of peace in the zone 
of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict after the cease-fire. This 
was announced to INTERFAX by the Armenian Defense Ministry press 
center. 
  During the meeting Sarkisyan considered it necessary to 
separate the conflicting parties after the armistice with 
utilization of special forces. He suggested that this would 
guarantee security for the Nagorno-Karabakh population. 
  James Collins proposed that the U.S. and Armenian defense 
structures continue to cooperate. 
  The NATO Partnership for Peace program was also discussed at 
the meeting. Contrary to Georgia and Azerbaijan, Armenia has 
not as yet joined it.

  [Text] On Saturday the Office of Chechen President Djokhar 
Dudayev supplied Interfax with a statement on relations between 
the Russian Federation and the Chechen republic. Groznyy sees 
consultations with the Chechen opposition, underway in Moscow, 
as a sign that Moscow has no intention of settling problems in 
bilateral relations by civilized and peaceful means. 
  The statement says Moscow's dialog with what is known as 
Chechnya's Provisional Council proves that Moscow "is trying to 
destabilize the situation in the Caucasus and the Chechen 
republic with a view to occupy Chechnya". 
  As a result, it is practically impossible for Groznyy to 
hold 
negotiations with Moscow. 
  The Chechen leaders repeat that a solution to the problem of 
bilateral relations can be found only by Presidents Dudayev and 
Yeltsin, in a face-to-face rendezvous. 
  Only a meeting between the two presidents can return to the 
norm relations between the Chechen republic and the Russian 
Federation, says Groznyy. All contacts with the so-called 
public and political forces, as represented by the Provisional 
Council, "will yield no result other than aggravation of 
bilateral relations". 
  Dudayev's Office rejected reports on plans to send an 
official delegation to Moscow.

  [Text] Moscow May 16 ITAR-TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin has named a new minister of nationalities and regional 
policy after dismissing Sergey Shakhray, the presidential press 
service reported today. 
  The new minister, Nikolay Yegorov, is an ethnic Cossack, who 
had made a lightning career, moving from a collective farm 
chairman to the leader of Russia's largest territory to the 
ministerial office. 
  Economist Nikolay Yegorov is 42-years-old and his last post 
was the leader of Kuban, Russia's southern frontier region. He 
is reputed to be a rational politician, capable of keeping 
stable the situation in a multinational border territory. He 
enjoys considerable authority not only in that territory but 
also among the leaders of Russia's north Caucasian republics. 
  Yegorov favours a tougher executive discipline as people are 
tired from disorder and irresponsibility and want authorities to 
be authoritative and not sideline dispassionate observers. 
  President Boris Yeltsin began his brief vacation in the 
south 
last March with a five-hour conversation with Yegorov, who was 
the head of administration of the Krasnodar territory. Their 
discussion of Kuban's problems as Russia's southern frontier 
territory, including migration of people from the flashpoints of 
ethnic tension in the Commonwealth must have impressed the 
president. Their discussion of migration and inter-ethnic 
relations continued later and may have prompted the present 
appointment.

  [Text] Rome, 15 May -- Speaking to Italian journalists, 
former USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev did not rule out the 
possibility that he would put himself in the running at the 
presidential elections in Russia. M. Gorbachev is in Venice, 
where he was invited to attend a seminar on security policy 
problems organized by UNESCO and the European Institute for 
Cooperation between East and West. 
  Asked by journalists to comment on the international 
community's initiative on the Yugoslav crisis, M. Gorbachev 
opined that the recognition by the West of the sovereignty of 
former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia and Croatia was too hasty. 
As for the possibility of the use of force by Western powers to 
settle the conflict in former Yugoslavia, in his view the 
threats that force would be used testify to the weakness of 
international diplomacy. 
  Having stressed in his conversation with journalists that 
the 
communist model has become obsolete, M. Gorbachev noted that the 
liberal model, currently widespread in Europe, was also in 
crisis. 
  That is why new ideas and new parties are needed, he 
stressed.

  [Text] The head of the administration of the Russian 
president Sergey Filatov has not seen yet the presidential 
decree relieving Deputy Prime-Minister Sergey Shakhray of the 
duties of the minister for nationalities and regional policy. 
In an interview with Interfax he said he was told that such a 
document exists. 
  "I know nothing about the reasons for the decision, if it 
was 
made," Filatov said. According to his personal viewpoint, the 
prevailing tendency now is not to let deputy prime-ministers 
have ministerial portfolios. The sphere which Shakhray is in 
charge is an especially striking example of the usefulness of 
this tendency, Filatov said.

<F P=106> [Ivan Boltovskiy article under the "After a Sensation" </F>
rubric: "Bomb Under the Constitution"] 
  [Text] It is now obvious that the protracted spin in which 
the country's economy finds itself has been caused not by the 
"democrats'" desire to improve it but by a rapacious struggle 
for the redistribution of property. In this the authorities 
have gone so far that they have set against themselves even some 
of their former patrons. 
  Almost six months after the referendum and the elections 
pro-U.S.-oriented foreign news sources suddenly reported that 
their results had been falsified: There was a voter turnout of 
less than 50 percent, which means the Constitution was not 
adopted. 
  The international observers who concealed the truth assume 
the expression of naive simpletons, pleading concern for Russia. 
Several months ago this concern made them lie, but now it makes 
them tell the truth. Love really is unpredictable. 
  So, the powers that be and the Constitution carved out by 
them have received from the West a crushing blow instead of 
credits, about which no one has breathed a word recently. And 
for the president -- a bomb under the czar's throne? Russia's 
rulers might end up on a par with their colleagues in Haiti. 
  The blow was not unexpected. Let us recall the scandal over 
the Russian spies, the Ames, which was blown up out of all 
proportion. Having kept them in cotton wool for about two years, 
for some reason they exposed them at just the time when B. 
Yeltsin was in the greatest need of foreign support. 
  There is more. When the Russian Government tried to pick up 
brownie points with its diplomatic activity in Yugoslavia, the 
United States ignored those peacemaking efforts and shot down 
Serb aircraft. There then followed the militarily pointless 
bombing of Serb territory. In response to Russia's attempts to 
show itself a great power, the United States roughly put it in 
its place, making it clear that Russia was no more than a 
provincial actress in a U.S. show. The presidential team, above 
all, was slighted. 
  Why has "friend Bill" swapped favor for anger? Or has he 
forgotten about the trillions of dollars spent on the struggle 
against communism, and is he now indifferent to what will happen 
to Russia? The stubborn show of U.S. hostility toward Russia 
can only be explained by a firm resolve to change its ruling 
clique. By what motives might the United States be guided? 
  The situation in the country is steadily deteriorating and 
will evidently be critical by the fall. The stoppage of 
enterprises and mass unemployment on the one hand. Harvest 
failure for well known reasons, a sharp fall in the livestock 
population, and the threat of famine on the other hand. Thus, a 
tight knot of very acute problems will have been tied in a 
number of regions by the fall: unemployment, a food shortage, 
and high prices. A social explosion is really in the cards. 
  Those who look at Russia with sober eyes understand that 
indignation will turn against capitalizers. Last year's 
elections convinced them of this. The people will sweep 
capitalism away, and some strong individual might accede to 
power on a broad wave of protest. The West does not doubt that 
such people still exist on Russian soil. 
  It is frequently possible to hear the surprised comment: 
"The people are being robbed, but they stay silent. They have 
simply been zombified!" This is nonsense, of course. Over the 
years of Soviet power a distinct type of social consciousness 
took shape in our country: The cells of society -- labor 
collectives -- were geared to the leaders and lived according to 
the rules of large families. Workers are not making a resolute 
protest not because they have been stupefied by somebody but 
because they cannot yet overcome a psychological barrier -- the 
president's authority. 
  The masses do not see a sufficiently strong figure in the 
opposition. When one appears, the people will wake up at once. 
They have already voiced their protest by casting their votes 
for Zhirinovskiy, although the majority take a highly ambiguous 
attitude toward him, to put it mildly. Therefore the 
peacemakers have good reason to make haste with the presidential 
election, without waiting for the masses themselves to nominate 
their leader. 
  The chief consequence of the election will not be a new 
president but a coalition government, whose creation is insisted 
on by practically the entire opposition. Being the Duma in 
miniature and being politically ill-assorted, it will not change 
the policy of capitalization. On the other hand, it will 
dissipate the working people's future discontent and carry it 
away. 
  Under these conditions the left-wing opposition must 
formulate more exactly its demand for a government of public 
confidence. In our view, the question should be raised of 
creating a socialist government which advocates the power of 
labor collectives based on the supremacy of ownership by the 
whole people and Soviet self-management. 
  It is highly doubtful that the trip to Germany will 
strengthen the president's position. It seems that there is 
still no getting away from an early election. 
  But a coalition government...is already being created, as 
evidenced by the appointment of N. Travkin, leader of the 
Democratic Party of Russia, as a minister. The fact that he 
will be without a portfolio is also symbolic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Internal Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin by </F>
Vladimir Klimov: "Providing a Contract Killing Service"] 
  [Text] [Klimov] First of all Viktor Fedorovich, I want to 
hear your assessment of the crime situation. What are its 
particular features at the moment? 
  [Yerin] Recently ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA published an Internal 
Affairs Ministry report to the citizens of Russia. It described 
in some detail both the main, very complex trends in the 
development of crime and the measures that the internal affairs 
organs are adopting to counter it. 
  We ourselves are seeking to convey to citizens our worries 
about the way some socioeconomic processes are going. Why? 
Well, because they are leading to the appearance of dangerous 
new criminal phenomena. For example, the illegal trade in 
firearms. When they fall into the hands of criminals, they 
become a threat to the lives of thousands of citizens. The 
credit and banking sphere is being criminalized and thefts of 
many billions of rubles have been identified. The same is 
happening in export-import deals. Every day we stop attempts to 
export raw materials and supplies that constitute Russian 
national assets. Serious problems are also arising in the 
privatization process and the development of the gambling 
business.... The list goes on. 
  Unfortunately the social danger of crimes of this kind is 
not 
always correctly reflected in the media. They are presented 
merely as another sensation. But the most important things -- 
the causes and conditions of crimes that jeopardize our state's 
national security and the results of the hard work to detect 
them -- escape public attention. 
  [Klimov] Contract killings have become more frequent of 
late. What are the statistics, and what do the figures tell us? 
  [Yerin] Before the mid-eighties we did not really encounter 
this phenomenon (aside from individual instances of the contract 
killing of a wife ordered by a husband or vice versa). It 
became a reality, in the first place, with the emergence of 
clients capable of paying considerable sums for the 
implementation of the criminal plan, and, second, the appearance 
of people (often with the essential combat experience) mentally 
prepared to carry out any contract, however dirty, for money. 
  An analysis shows that murders by hired killers have become 
more frequent in the past two years. In 1992 around 100 were 
recorded; in 1993 there were 2.5 times more. As a rule, each of 
them captures public attention because the victims are people 
who are pretty well known in their own milieu. 
  Increasingly we are encountering cases where violence is 
used 
as a means of pressuring representatives of the authorities, or 
as a means of intimidating or removing business rivals. 
  Militia officers prevent a large number of these crimes at 
the planning or preparation stage. Nonetheless, bloody clashes 
between criminal formations, attacks on competitors, and the 
killing of people working in commerical structures are almost 
daily events. 
  Militia officers are hard at work all the time, often 
risking 
their lives. I sincerely regret that the results of their 
dangerous work are of little interest to journalists. It occurs 
to me that it might be to someone's advantage to give the public 
the impression that the militia is not detecting this kind of 
crime, that it is not doing its duty. Far from it. In St. 
Petersburg, in February, militia officers arrested two hired 
killers from Tajikistan. They had been hired by an entrepreneur 
who was being plagued by racketeers in order to deal with his 
tormentors. The killers shot seven people, using 
submachineguns. The murderers were arrested, but the 
entrepreneur who ordered the punishment was a criminal too. 
  Some days ago officers from Moscow Main Internal Affairs 
Administration organized crime and criminal investigation 
components arrested six members of an established criminal gang 
who were providing a contract killing service. They would go 
all over Russia to commit the crimes. Believe me, it is very 
difficult tracking down and neutralizing gangs like these. But 
criminal militia officers have now accumulated considerable 
experience, mastered new methods, and are achieving decent 
results. Sure, unfortunately we are not yet managing to solve 
every murder. But we are trying to do so. 
  [Klimov] What specific cases of contract killings can you 
tell us about? 
  [Yerin] First of all I want to say that in the process of 
detecting and investigating a crime such as a contract killing 
militia officers and Prosecutor's Office staff usually encounter 
a very experienced, brutal, and shrewd opponent, who takes care 
to cover his tracks. So we cannot expect this kind of crime to 
be cleared up quickly -- in, say, a few hours. It is a long and 
painstaking job. For instance, the Udmurt Republic Internal 
Affairs Ministry organized crime administration found that a 
certain B. had been involved in more than 30 contract killings. 
He was referred to the criminal investigation department. But 
the numerous clients heard about it and, fearing exposure, dealt 
with him themselves. He was found in the woods with a bullet in 
the back of his head, together with the pistol that shot him. 
  The deputy administration chief of D. city was killed in 
Tver 
by a bullet from a revolver. The investigation team that 
analyzed the motivational aspect of the case established that 
there had been a difference of opinion between the victim and a 
group of local businessmen and dealers from neighboring 
countries over an order for the construction of a prestige 
development and the right to preferential use of the plot of 
land allocated for that purpose. All the criminals could come up 
with was the idea of hiring a killer, who removed the "obstacle" 
in the person of the leader. 
  Criminal investigation officers in Moscow exposed the deputy 
general director of a joint venture who, in an effort to conceal 
some illegal financial transactions, hired a killer, who shot 
one of his business partners. Then another strangled the 
perpetrator of the first murder, thus removing a damgerous 
witness. 
  I could continue to give examples of this kind, but there is 
something more important. Analysis shows that the bulk of the 
contract killings are committed because of conflicts in the 
sphere of commercial and financial activity arising in the 
struggle for markets, for spheres of influence, and for other 
mercenary motives. 
  [Klimov] Figures have appeared in the press that some 30,000 
murders have been committed in three months. The Internal 
Affairs Ministry is accused of doing nothing about it. What 
have you to say about this? 
  [Yerin] Accusing the Internal Affairs Ministry is a familiar 
ploy, and the normal thing to do for many people. Although it 
is forgotten that it is not the Internal Affairs Ministry system 
that causes crime. It is a product of relationships in society, 
of its diseases. 
  As for the figures you cited, I would say that they are 
untrue. In the first quarter 7,581 murders or attempted murders 
were recorded. Some 4,659 or 75 percent of them were solved 
through the militia's efforts. Three-fourths of the killers 
were arrested. A substantial and tangible result. But we still 
have a great deal to do to improve this work. 
  But let us consider something else. Last year internal 
affairs organs for the first time had to identify and solve 
murders committed in order to obtain privatized housing. In 
Moscow alone it was established that more than 20 people had 
been killed after sales contracts had been drawn up. Killings 
masquerading as cases where citizens have disappeared without 
trace are also becoming widespread. Why is it that those who 
establish and adopt the procedure for legal arrangements 
relating to privatization and inheritance fail to rectify these 
things immediately in order to prevent further tragedies? 
  Weapons have become an independent and constant factor in 
the 
deteriorating operational situation. In 1992 and 1993 the 
number of crimes in which firearms were used doubled. 
  The full-scale "Signal" and "Arsenal" operations that the 
Russian Internal Affairs Ministry is conducting are producing 
definite results. We have seized a large quantity of weapons 
and ammunition, thus preventing a number of dangerous crimes. 
But these weapons come from the enterprises that made them and 
from militarized components. Are their leaders thinking about 
ways to keep their extremely dangerous property safe? Have they 
done all they can to rule out any possibility of thefts or 
losses and illegal sales of weapons? 
  Militia operational services and the investigative 
apparatus have been under extreme pressure for a long time, 
facing two-to-four times as much work as normal. The physical, 
mental, intellectual, and emotional capacity of the officer is 
being tested to the limit. 
  Recently they have succeeded in neutralizing a whole series 
of bandit gangs. For instance, a gang headed by S., a former 
convict, was arrested for committing 15 or so assaults and 
murders of heavy truck drivers in Moscow and Moscow Oblast in 
order to seize the truck and its load. Similar gangs have been 
detained in Krasnodar and Maritime Krays and Khakasia. 
Dangerous maniac killers have even been identified and exposed 
in Moscow and Khabarovsk. 
  Our most skilled cadres are always sent in to solve crimes 
like these and arrest and neutralize the criminals. We expect 
officers to be tough and uncompromising in these extreme 
situations and use weapons and special facilities on a 
legitimate basis. Last year the militia used weapons on 2,739 
occasions; 1,561 criminals were wounded and 376 were killed. 
  In 1993 the murder rate increased by around 50 percent, this 
year it has increased by less than nine percent. For the first 
time in some years the number of killings fell in 28 regions. 
In three months the ongoing investigations of more than 4,700 
murder cases were completed as a result of measures adopted in 
conjunction with the Prosecutor's Office investigative 
components. In 29 percent of the remaining cases we now have 
defendants, and the files on them will be passed to the courts. 
  [Klimov] What and who is hindering the militia's fight 
against crime? 
  [Yerin] Briefly, first and foremost, shortcomings in the 
existing legal base and elements of inconsistency in the 
implementation of a unified legal policy. Criminal laws must be 
hard-hitting -- not savage, but capable of effectively 
neutralizing criminal activity. Their observance and unfailing 
execution will make it possible not only to curb but also to 
suppress crime. 
  The increase in crime requires a further strengthening of 
the 
staffs of operational, investigation, criminal expert, and other 
services, the improvement of vocational training and retention 
of cadres, and the provision of better equipment. And we are 
talking about not only Internal Affairs Ministry organs but the 
Prosecutor's Office, the courts, forensic medicine, and judicial 
administration. Our work on solving murders is bound up with 
investigations by the Prosecutor's Office, where the situation 
is rapidly deteriorating. For example, in a number of rayons of 
Khabarovsk Kray there are no Prosecutor's Office investigators 
at all any more. You have a similar situation in Irkutsk and a 
number of other oblasts. 
  The existing principle of merging minor with greater 
penalties looks archaic in present-day circumstances. Because 
of it defendants will be in the same position whether they have 
committed one or dozens of dangerous crimes. 
  In recent decades a liberal attitude to the application of 
the law has been gaining a foothold in investigation and 
judicial practice. I am not bloodthirsty but, if society is 
really concerned about the problem of crime, then it must ensure 
that those who break the law, especially those who do it 
deliberately, are severely punished. 
  The militia is tired of waiting for new laws reflecting the 
realities of social relations today. It is no accident that 
components of the Federation have lately begun issuing their own 
legal acts. The practice of applying them in Tatarstan, 
Bashkortostan, and Mordovia has not only demonstrated their 
effectiveness but has also revealed a curious phenomenon: 
Criminals have started actively "emigrating" from the republics 
on sensing the changes in the legal climate. 
  The Internal Affairs Ministry collegium, the leaders of the 
Internal Affairs Ministry, internal affairs admnistrations, 
transport internal affairs administrations, and other subunits 
and the vast majority of personnel are working hard to protect 
Russians from offenders. This is not an attempt to protect our 
reputation. We give no quarter to those internal affairs organs' 
officers who fall short of the high requirements of the job, who 
betray the interests of the service, or who are in cahoots with 
the criminal element. We have a great deal to do to increase 
the professionalism of the personnel and general standards. 
  At the same time, I believe that without a united front in 
the fight against crime we will not prevail. Everyone must do 
his bit to fight it: militia officer and journalist, moviemaker 
and pedagogue, deputy and scholar. It is a common cause.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Yanayev report in the "Opposition Is Looking for </F>
the Leader" column: "All Leaders Are Great but Zyuganov Can 
Become Even Greater"] 
  [Text] Russian opposition groups want to find a single 
leader and form a powerful movement around him. As the May Day 
demonstrations have shown, there are not a few wishing to become 
such a leader. Moreover, even such discarded political figures 
as Valentin Varennikov are trying to play first fiddle. 
Yesterday Varennikov was registered as a candidate for the 
Federation Council in the Chelyabinsk constituency. A founding 
congress of the Accord for Russia movement, scheduled for 19 
May, is supposed to elect a Russia-wide leader. 
  The chances of Valentin Varennikov's making it back even 
into 
a group of opposition leaders, just as of securing a seat in 
parliament, are not very good. The opposition has far more 
colorful figures capable of claiming a leadership role. These 
are primarily Aleksandr Rutskoy, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Valeriy 
Zorkin, Ilya Konstantinov, and Sergey Baburin. 
  It was originally believed that they would all rally around 
the Accord for Russia movement whose founding congress, 
scheduled for 19 May, will clear up who is the most important 
among them. It can be presumed even now, however, that one of 
the initiators of this movement, Valeriy Zorkin, will most 
likely not be such. Obviously the Accord was to have become the 
former Constitutional Court chairman's sponsoring organization 
because there are no other forces behind him. However, although 
representatives of the majority of opposition parties and unions 
have signed the program document of this movement, no mighty 
coalition has emerged. 
  "October heroes" Aleksandr Rutskoy and Ilya Konstantinov are 
currently engaged in creating a new movement, The State 
[Derzhava]; Gennadiy Zyuganov has a self-sufficient Communist 
Party which has no particular need for blocs with any other 
organizations. Generally it now turns out that the majority of 
opposition politicians are convinced that Zorkin is obviously 
unfit for the role of leader, while the Accord has no chance of 
becoming much more than a Moscow political club. 
  As for Rutskoy and Konstantinov, it is also difficult to see 
any forces standing behind them. Meanwhile Rutskoy has already 
promised that the State movement will encompass thousands of 
people, that it will have an "iron discipline," and that 
finally, it will come to power no later than in a year. Yet it 
is absolutely unlikely that the opposition will want to 
recognize Rutskoy as leader. Most politicians from this camp 
relate to him negatively. Stanislav Terekhov considers him one 
of the main culprits for the October defeat while Gennadiy 
Zyuganov is convinced that after the amnesty Rutskoy must leave 
the political arena altogether. Even Konstantinov, who calls 
Rutskoy a friend, says in private that the former vice president 
"usually changes his views three times a day." 
  The political bankruptcy of the majority of the current 
opposition leaders could prove beneficial for Communist Party 
Chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov, who will thus get rid of 
competition. The fact that Zyuganov heads Russia's largest party 
and bears no responsibility for the opposition's October defeat 
makes him the most acceptable figure for the role of Russia-wide 
opposition leader. How realistic his chances of becoming such 
will be shown by the congress of the Free Russia People's Party, 
scheduled for 22 May, whose leadership Rutskoy may give up for 
the sake of creating the State movement. Then the sole thread 
linking the former vice president to any consequential political 
movement will be broken. Also critical for Zyuganov's future 
will be the Accord for Russia congress.

  [Text] Moscow May 13 TASS -- Former parliament speaker 
Ruslan Khasbulatov is back in Moscow from his native Chechnya 
and has returned to work as the head of a desk at the Academy of 
National Economy where he used to teach before his political 
career began. 
  In an interview with the hard-line opposition "ZAVTRA" 
newspaper published on Friday, the former speaker, who was 
released from jail in February under the State Duma-proclaimed 
political amnesty, said he is not going to participate in 
opposition rallies and demonstrations and his political activity 
would manifest itself only in articles and interviews. "I am 
not a rally regular, I am not used to participating in 
demonstrations and shouting out slogans", he stressed. 
  Speaking about his arch rival Boris Yeltsin, Khasbulatov 
said 
that only "a fascist regime" could have pounded the 
parliamentary building with tanks, but stressed at the same time 
that he is sure that a big of top [as received] politicians 
wants to reform Russia on a democratic basis. 
  "Only a fascist regime could have surrounded the parliament 
with barbed wire, sent people armed to the teeth against 
lawmakers and their defenders, shot in [as received] women and 
children", he said and added "I nevertheless believed and still 
believe that a big group of policy-makers in this country 
strives to reform it on democratic grounds". 
  Khasbulatov praised his ally and former vice-president 
Aleksandr Rutskoy as "a politician with a great future, as a man 
who the people may trust". 
  During the October revolt Rutskoy behaved as a "dynamic and 
courageous" man, but his entourage failed him, according to 
Khasbulatov. "If Rutskoy with his understanding of issues in 
position of acting president was surrounded by competent 
specialists, the events could have gone in another way", he said. 
  Speaking about himself, Khasbulatov said that no 
"destructive" changes had occurred with him after he suffered a 
defeat in the October revolt and was imprisoned. "I left the 
prison just as I entered it", he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Dubinin, acting Russian minister of </F>
finance, under the "Economics" rubric: "The State Budget 
Reflects the Policy of Financial Stabilization"] 
  [Text] Following the State Duma's discussion of the draft 
federal budget, which has been finalized with due regard for 
deputies' comments, not even prejudiced observers must have any 
complaints against the government. All suspicions and rash 
accusations that the government is prepared to abandon the 
policy of financial stabilization under pressure from sectoral 
and regional lobbyists are refuted by dry figures. 
  We propose that the federal budget deficit will amount to 
68.8 trillion rubles [R] this year and that it will not exceed 
9.5 percent of GDP. At the same time the expenditure part of 
the budget is increasing by R10.1 trillion -- which, in toto, 
will give R193.3 trillion. The increase in revenue will be a 
more modest R3.7 trillion -- which, in the final analysis, will 
amount to R124 trillion. 
  These key indicators speak for themselves. Whether we will 
manage to consolidate our hold on these positions and not blow 
the budget to pieces with new "expenditure" decisions is another 
matter. But the draft's discussion in the State Duma and the 
assistance given us by deputies in the course of its correction 
make me confident that we have managed to arrange businesslike 
cooperation and work fruitfully on common problems. 
  Of course, it is impossible to reach a consensus that 
satisfies everyone without a search for sensible compromise 
solutions acceptable to both sides. In working on the draft 
budget, the Ministry of Finance endeavored to take the deputies' 
valid demands into consideration as far as possible. We agreed 
that the structure of expenditure must be shifted toward an 
increase in the size of funding for the agro-industrial complex, 
industry, and the social sphere. For example, cultural and 
health care establishments will receive an additional R968.4 
billion. Appropriations to support the mass media (particularly 
television and radio broadcasting) will increase by R434 
billion. One percent of personal income tax will henceforth 
remain at the disposal of the local authorities.

<F P=106> [Letter from ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editorial office to Vice </F>
Premier Yuriy Yarov followed by reply from Yarov: "Vice Premier 
Yuriy Yarov: Government Will Redeem its Debts"] 
  [Text]Letter from Editorial Office 
  Respected Yuriy Fedorovich! Our newspaper's editorial office 
has received a large number of letters in which our readers 
basically pose the following questions: 
  When will the Russian Federation Government be able to 
redeem 
the interest-free consumer goods bonds (against automobiles, 
television sets, refrigerators, etc.) purchased by citizens in 
1990? The period for redeeming the bonds ran out in 1993, and 
over this period the invested money has become devalued and 
confidence in the government has been falling. 
  Will deposits made in Savings Bank accounts before the 
beginning of price liberalization be indexed, and if so, when? 
<H5>  Letter to Editorial Office </H5>
  Like the editorial office of your newspaper, the Russian 
Federation Government receives quite a few letters in which 
Russian citizens ask questions about the fate of the 1990 state 
targeted interest-free loan bonds for consumer goods. 
  In 1990 the USSR Government issued bonds equal in value to 
the price of the corresponding consumer goods. It was envisaged 
that these bonds would be redeemed during 1993 by releasing the 
consumer goods -- cars, motorcycles with sidecars, color 
television sets, compact tractors, videorecorders, two- and 
three-compartment refrigerators, microwave ovens, "Zig-Zag" 
sewing machines, "Vyatka-Avtomat" washing machines, and personal 
computers. 
  Russian citizens acquired 3,654,000 bonds for various types 
of commodities, including 143,700 for cars. 
  With conditions of strict state regulation of production and 
distribution of output (in accordance with quotas and stocks 
under a system of fixed prices), and taking into consideration 
the prospects for further growth in output of consumer goods in 
high demand, honoring the pledges the government had undertaken 
was feasible. 
  With the transition to a new system of economic management 
(without state orders for the production and delivery to the 
consumer market of cars and cultural, consumer, and household 
goods) and the actual absence of a number of goods prevented the 
pledges being honored in 1993. For example, when 30,000 compact 
tractors were due in 1993 only 7,000 of them were produced, 
likewise the figures for videorecorders were 588,000 and 268,000 
respectively. Apart from this, centralized deliveries of 
certain types of goods from former union republics stopped 
(like, for example, "Tavriya" automobiles from Ukraine and 
"Minsk" refrigerators from Belorussia [Belarus]), for which 
bonds had also been issued. 
  The Russian Federation Government is preparing a package of 
documents which would allow a resolution of the problem by 
redeeming all types of state goods bonds with a partial 
indexation of their face value based on the federal budget's 
actual potential. 
  Specifically, the Russian Federation Government adopted 16 
April 1994 Decree No. 344 "On State Goods Bonds," in accordance 
with which the Finance Ministry will redeem holders' 1990 
targeted interest-free loan bonds for domestically produced 
consumer goods (apart from for cars) in accordance with present 
consumer prices, and for cars at 60 percent of their price. It 
will also pay off liabilities in respect of pledges to suppliers 
of agricultural output from the 1991 harvest. All these 
measures will be taken between 15 June 1994 and 1 June 1995 
using the federal budget's assets. In the draft 1994 budget 2 
trillion rubles have been set aside to redeem bonds. 
  That is, despite all the difficulties, the government has 
found an opportunity to repay its debt to the citizens of Russia. 
  The second set of questions concerns the indexation of 
people's deposits in the Russian Savings Bank. This is an 
important though fairly complex problem. Clearly, everyone 
understands well that to instantly restore the deposits' value 
might lead to an abrupt boosting of inflationary processes. 
Moreover, the state does not today have at its disposal the 
necessary financial resources to index all the deposits 
realistically. 
  In connection with this, one possible way of resolving the 
problem is to transfer state property, state enterprises' 
shares, and land to the depositors. But time is needed to 
identify the items of state property, part of whose value could 
be transferred to offset the depositors' losses, and to 
establish the conditions and time scales for their transfer, 
that is, it is impossible to carry out full and immediate 
indexation at the moment. 
  But the government is resolving these questions too. 
  In accordance with the Russian Federation Government's plan 
for immediate action, which was confirmed by Russian Federation 
Government Decree No. 192 of 9 March 1994, the Russian Ministry 
of Finance, the Russian State Committee for the Management of 
State Property, the Russian Ministry of Economics, and the 
Russian Ministry of Social Protection of the Population have 
been entrusted with the task of preparing the necessary 
normative acts on these questions in May of this year.

Government allocates funds for the agency's operations, 
including its expenditure on developing its material and 
technical base, capital construction, implementation of social 
programs for the agency staff, operational requirements, 
maintenance of agency offices, payment for communications 
services, provision of information services to the 
administration of the Russian Federation president, the Federal 
Assembly, the Russian Federation Government and the federal 
bodies of executive authority. 
  In accordance with the charter, RIA "NOVOSTI" is headed by 
the chairman of the board, who is appointed, as are his 
deputies, by the Russian Federation Government. The 
consultative body, the RIA "NOVOSTI" board, is made up of the 
chairman of the RIA "NOVOSTI" board, his deputies and other 
senior staff, and also of representatives of other

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "GLAGOL Closes Down, While `Echo' </F>
Dies Away"] 
  [Text] The decisions in regard to the Russian Press House 
are essentially discrimination against the mass media on the 
part of the power structures, and they abridge citizens' rights 
to get information, says a statement of the Judicial Chamber for 
Information Disputes under the Russian Federation president, 
ITAR- TASS reports. 
  As many people know, at issue is the second move for the 
Russian Press House from premises where nearly 40 mass media 
editorial offices operate. 
  The document states that the new move has paralyzed the work 
of dozens of editorial offices. The collectives are incurring 
losses running into millions. The children's newspaper GLAGOL 
has been forced to announce closure. The board of the "Echo of 
Moscow" joint-stock company made a decision on liquidating the 
"Echo Moskvy" radio station if the losses and outlays are not 
paid. In its appeal the Judicial Chamber urges the organs of 
state power "to find a wise solution."

<F P=106> [Petr Kondrashov report: "Greeks Short on Conversation: </F>
They Prefer a Quick Blow on the Head. PRAVDA's Owners Reprimand 
V. Linnik for Poor Work"] 
  [Text] An incident occurred on the evening of 11 May in 
PRAVDA Chief Editor Aleksandr Ilin's office that was probably 
the first in the oldest Communist newspaper's 82-year existence. 
According to eyewitnesses, it all started with Viktor Linnik, 
appointed PRAVDA's chief by the court, accusing Ilin of 
attempting to improve his material position at the newspaper's 
expense. However Linnik's recriminations rebounded on him: 
Sokolenko, a spokesman for the Greeks on the editorial board, 
whom Ilin called as a witness, said that the owners do not pay 
the incumbent chief editor a kopek extra and Linnik himself, 
according to Sokolenko, as leader of PRAVDA, regularly received 
large amounts of hard currency from the Greeks (and there are 
allegedly receipts to prove it), but despite this he demanded 
more. After this Linnik attacked the Greeks' representative 
like an enraged bear, but he probably got more than he bargained 
for and following a brief scuffle was well and truly thrashed by 
his former employer. 
  It is worthy of note that, despite this, PRAVDA published in 
the morning as always without a hitch.

  [Text] Vladivostok May 14 TASS -- A depot of aviation bombs 
belonging to the Pacific Fleets's air wing exploded on Saturday 
near the village of Novonezhino in the Russian Far Eastern 
maritime territory. 
  According to the duty officer of the maritime territory 
civil 
defence headquarters, the explosion occurred at 15.40 local time 
in the village which is located 100 kilometers north of the 
territory's administrative centre Vladivostok. There have been 
no immediate reports about damages or casualties. 
  Armored vehicles have been dispatched to the area to 
evacuate 
the inhabitants. A group of specialists of the federal 
counterintelligence service and the commander of the Pacific 
Fleet's air wing have departed for the area. 
  The effects of the explosion were felt in Vladivostok and 
the 
city of Artem as earthquake tremors. Alarmed people have been 
phoning the Far Eastern regional rescue service to find out what 
caused the tremors and what they should do in the situation. 
Meanwhile the civil defence headquarters has reported that there 
is no danger for the cities of Artem and Vladivostok. 
  The explosion occurred exactly two years after the Pacific 
Fleet depot in Vladivostok exploded on May 14, 1992. 
  There were no nuclear or chemical weapons in the aviation 
bomb depot of the Russian Pacific Fleet's air wing where a 
shattering explosion occurred on Saturday afternoon, sources in 
the Russian Federal Ministry of Emergencies told ITAR-TASS. 
There was no immediate information about the causes and effects 
of the explosion. 
  An electrical train has arrived at Novonezhino to evacuate 
local inhabitants, and a special group from the Russian Defence 
Ministry has left Moscow by plane en route to Vladivostok and 
the site of the explosion. 
  As reported earlier, another explosion occurred two years 
ago 
today, on May 14, 1992 at the Pacific Fleet ammunition dump on 
the outskirts of Vladivostok near the factories Izumrud 
(Emerald) and Varyag (Varangian). 
  At that time a fire broke out through negligence of the 
service personnel at the ammunition dump which held 2200 
truckloads of ammunition. 122-mm and 100-mm artillery shells 
and 120-mm mines kept exploding for several days with their 
splinters sent hurling for miles around. Civil defence and army 
units, the city militia, firefighters and ambulance cars were 
brought out in force to combat the fire. Several people, 
including military school cadets were killed and considerable 
damage was done to the storage facilities of the Russian Pacific 
Fleet in the region. 
  First Deputy Commander of the Russian Pacific Fleet Igor 
Khmelnov flew to the site of the explosion at a Pacific Fleet 
air wing ammunition dump, which occurred at 16.00 local time, 
the Russian Defence Ministry's information and press department 
told ITAR-TASS. 
  According to the same source, for the time being there is no 
direct communication with the military settlement in which the 
disaster occurred. 
  Forces and means of Pacific Fleet units have been dispatched 
to the site to look into the situation and clean up the effects 
of the explosion. 
  Interaction has been arranged between the Defence Ministry 
and the specialists of the Russian Federal Ministry of 
Emergencies. 
  The fire at the Pacific Fleet Air Wing's ammunition dump, 
which resulted from today's explosion, is being localized, 
according to the fleet's senior duty officer Vsevolod Fadeyev. 
  According to Fadeyev, groups of specialists, including 
sappers, have arrived on the scene, where first deputy commander 
of the Pacific Fleet, Vice Admiral Igor Khmelnov is in charge of 
the clean- up operations. 
  The Pacific Fleet Commander Georgiy Gurinov is at the 
fleet's 
main command post, coordinating the activity of all the forces 
involved. The fleet's structures are on the stand-by. 
  Fadeyev also said that fleet units and security forces are 
controlling the situation in the disaster area, and the 
evacuation of residents from Novonezhino is being managed 
effectively.

  [Text] Vladivostok, 14 May -- As a result of today's 
explosion of ammunition depots belonging to the Pacific Fleet's 
air wing, there are casualties. According to preliminary data 
obtained by ITAR-TASS, all windows in the settlement of 
Novonezhino, located near the accident site, were blown out by 
the shock wave [of the blast]. 
  The evacuation of the settlement's 3,000 inhabitants has 
begun. They are being taken to the towns of Bolshoy Kamen and 
Partizansk, where they are being accommodated in palaces of 
culture and sport, hotels, and hostels. The evacuation 
operation is being directed by Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, head of 
administration of Primorskiy Kray. 
  According to a report from the hospital in Bolshoy Kamen, 
the 
first casualties, with slight injuries, have arrived there from 
the vicinity of the explosion. 
  In order to avoid further mishaps, the military and the 
militia have cordoned off the accident site within a radius of 
30 km. Traffic on the Vladivostok-Nakhodka road, which passes 
through Novonezhino, has been stopped.

  [Text] This is what IMA-PRESS has to say: At 1530 local 
time [0530 GMT] today, the inhabitants of Vladivostok saw a huge 
explosive mushroom, similar to that from a nuclear explosion. 
Lieutenant-Colonel (Kuliyev), duty officer of the Maritime 
region's civil defense, reported the storage depot contained 
neither chemical nor biological nor nuclear munitions, but only 
unguided [neupravlayemiye] missiles, shells, and depth charges. 
At 2230 Vladivostok time [1230 GMT], the fire and explosions 
were continuing. The area was concealed by thick smoke, 
therefore it is difficult to assess the damage. There is 
information about a great number of injured, mostly people hurt 
by glass splinters from windows which were put out in all the 
surrounding settlements. The director of Vladivostok private 
radio station, (Dmitriy Bruzgin), informed IMA-PRESS that more 
than 10 eyewitnesses had phoned the radio with reports of people 
injured. Pioneer camps, dormitories and hotels are being 
prepared for the evacuation of settlements near to the scene.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 May -- The Chief Command of the Russian 
Navy, the Ministry for Emergency Situations, and the Pacific 
Fleet's Command are undertaking all possible measures to 
eliminate the consequences of today's explosion that resulted 
from a fire at the fleet's aviation munitions dump near the 
village of Novonezhino in Maritime Kray. 
  ITAR-TASS has been told in the press center of the Russian 
Navy that an armored group of a Pacific Fleet coastal defense 
formation, tanks, and armored personnel carriers are operating 
in the area; some of the fleet's aircraft (a plane and a 
helicopter) have been brought in to study the site of the 
accident. 
  According to data currently available, there have been no 
victims among the guards or the personnel servicing the dump. 
  According to the assessments of specialists, the distance to 
which shrapnel will scatter as a result of the munitions' 
explosions (conventional munitions were stored at the dump) 
rules out the possibility of their falling on housing and other 
buildings of the civilian population of the villages of 
Novonezhino and Romanovka. 
  The situation in the disaster area is under unremitting 
control.

  [Text] As you know a catastrophe occurred at Novonezhino on 
14 May, exactly two years after the explosions at the Vtoraya 
Rechka fleet arsenal in Vladivostok. According to witnesses the 
power of the explosion the day before yesterday was equivalent 
to the explosion of a nuclear bomb and it was a terrible scene. 
The area looks like a war zone. This was confirmed by Yevgeniy 
Nazdratenko, the kray governor, who went on the air over our 
television and radio company yesterday. He noted the 
coordination and operational efficiency of the militia, fleet, 
and administration throughout the kray, the medical services and 
everyone who was called up during the emergency. 
  Disasters unite people and in such a critical situation 
people show their best qualities. According to reports, the 
fire in Novonezhino was localized on Sunday [15 May] and people 
have returned to their homes. But how much effort and money 
will now be needed to restore normal life and eliminate the 
consequences of the disaster? The cause of the catastrophe is 
not yet known but an investigation is underway and the 
commission will report on its findings.

  [Text] Vladivostok May 16 TASS -- The gigantic blast of 
ammunition in the village of Novonezheno in Russia's Far Eastern 
Maritime Territory on May 14 lasted for several hours as nearly 
1,600 tonnes of bombs and various missiles, as well as landmines 
and artillery shells exploded one by one and in groups, 
showering the ground with fragments and splinters for miles 
around. Several shells and missiles hit the city of Bolshoy 
Kamen, many kilometres from Novonezhino. 
  This was announced on Monday at a press conference for 
Russian and foreign journalists by the head of administration of 
the Maritime Territory Yevgeniy Nazdratenko. He also said that 
units of field engineers are being brought to the Maritime 
Territory from Russia's entire Pacific rim to clean up the 
effects of the accident. They are expected to thoroughly inspect 
the entire affected territory, locate and eliminate any 
unexploded ammunition. Yevgeniy Nazdratenko said the bombs, 
missiles and shells which have remained intact in the storage 
facilities will be exploded, and the facility will never be 
restored in the same place, particularly since the local 
inhabitants had expressed their disagreement with its location 
for some time past.

  [Text] A chain of explosions was set off today by a fire at 
the Pacific Fleet aviation bomb depot, situated near the 
settlement of Novonezhino, 100 kilometers from Vladivostok. Our 
correspondent Olga Zhurman has further details. 
  [Zhurman] The fire alarm was sounded at 1520 hours. 
According to preliminary information, it was caused by the 
spring stubble burning. The shell explosions spread over a 
distance of approximately six or seven kilometers. According to 
the military, no nuclear or chemical weapons were stored at the 
depot. 
  The fire is still going on. The governor of the kray, head 
of the internal affairs department, and head of the kray's 
federal counterintelligence service are at the site of the 
accident. According to them, there are no casualties. Several 
houses in Novoneshino had their roofs blown off. The explosion 
wave broke a large glass display window of a department store in 
the town of Artem. Explosions can be heard in one of the 
Vladivostok districts across the Ussuriysk Bay, which separates 
the city from the accident site. The inhabitants of Novonizhino 
and the nearby settlements are being evacuated. The site of the 
accident has been cordoned off.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 16 May -- Military experts believe that the 
defense budget, whose first reading has been approved by the 
State Duma, may effectively deprive Russia of its strategic 
nuclear forces (SNF), which could in turn call in question the 
need to comply with the international START I and START II 
Treaties. 
  They feel that if funding remains fixed at the level of 1993 
and the first quarter of this year, meeting only 10 percent of 
the SNF's requirements, then by the year 2000 the strategic 
missile forces (SMF) will have only 90 launch facilities left at 
their disposal. 
  Three years after that there will be none left at all. So, 
the whole point of complying with the stipulations of the START 
I Treaty and of ratifying START II will have been lost. The 
aims of these documents, which set out parameters for reduction 
of strategic offensive armaments, will have been achieved and 
exceeded "automatically." 
  Colonel General Vasiliy Vorobyev, head of the main 
directorate for the military budget and funding of the Russian 
Defense Ministry, told ITAR-TASS today that the funds earmarked 
for the Defense Ministry are scarcely enough to settle debts for 
electricity, food, property services, and municipal charges. He 
said that the payment of debts for supplies of equipment and 
armaments was also in doubt. There is no funding for research 
and development work, including research in areas regarded as 
crucial to national security. 
  Military experts are of the view that the budget should be 
adjusted in order to ensure that Russia remains a nuclear power 
and does not lose its status. When defense spending comes up 
for consideration in the State Duma for a second time, it would 
be expedient, they say, to take account of the need to maintain 
nuclear parity as the main guarantee of the state's national 
security. In accordance with the international treaties, by the 
year 2000 Russia should have 900 SMF launch facilities. The 
aviation component of the SNF should have 900 weapons and the 
naval component 1,700. In line with the treaty, the total 
number of Russian nuclear warheads should be 3,500. This is 
rather fewer than the United States, but wholly sufficient to 
deter a potential enemy. This provision is enshrined in the new 
military doctrine and corresponds to the interests of national 
security.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "State Duma Denies the Army Its </F>
`Subsistence Minimum'"] 
  [Text] The 1994 state budget was given its first reading 
by the State Duma 11 May. The total budget expenditure, 
revenues, and deficit were approved. The deficit stands at 36 
percent of the budget. The Ministry of Defense request (backed 
by the Russian Federation president) that 18 trillion rubles be 
added to the defense budget failed to gain the requisite number 
of votes. Nor was any attention paid to the desperate attempts 
by the Duma Committee for Defense (chairman -- Sergey Yushenkov) 
to convince deputies that the point at issue concerned not some 
kind of excessive requirements but the elementary "subsistence 
minimum" needed by the Armed Forces to maintain the country's 
defense capability at the requisite level. 
  Acting Finance Minister Mr. Dubinin used essentially the 
same 
argument to parry all arguments in the Army's favor: Any 
appropriation of additional sums for defense would increase the 
budget deficit which, in turn, would lead to a new spiral of 
inflation and higher prices, which would mean that everyone -- 
including the Army -- would end up as losers. As a matter of 
fact, the selfsame way to curb inflation was also chosen by the 
"Russia's Choice" faction and the Yabloko bloc. 
  Recognizing the critical danger of unleashing inflationary 
processes with a budget deficit in excess of 40 percent, 
representatives of several other factions suggested different 
measures. For example, Sergey Glazyev (Democratic Party of 
Russia faction), chairman of the State Duma Committee for 
Economic Policy, questioned the need to spend such impressive 
amounts on the maintenance of the state apparatus. Furthermore, 
he assumes that the planned revenues from the privatization of 
state property have been inexplicably reduced. According to 
specialists, there are other ways making it possible to 
painlessly increase the financial support for defense, science, 
culture, and education. But the State Duma and the government 
now perceive the Army as the main "defendant" when it comes to 
anti-inflation security. 
  I would imagine that there is no need to explain to KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA readers -- whose knowledge of today's realities in the 
Armed Forces is not based on speculative surveys -- the meaning 
of the defense budget's reduction by a factor of 1.5 from the 
original estimates. Essentially this means further decrepitude 
of the Army's military-technical potential and curtailment of 
the structural changes envisaged by the military reform (the 
loudest shouts of "Where are the Army reforms?" come from those 
who refuse to allocate money for these reforms). 
  It has to be bluntly said that the shorn defense budget will 
deal a crushing blow on enterprises working on military orders. 
We all know that there are quite a few such enterprises in the 
country. Workers and engineers from the defense sector have 
only just ended their protest actions outside Government House. 
They were promised real assistance. But it appears that 
hundreds of thousands of people are again being told to switch 
to a "self-survival regime." Subsidies have also been cut for 
the long-suffering conversion which actually degenerates into 
convulsion at times, while scientific and technical work in the 
military sphere is being frozen with consequences which are easy 
to calculate. But is anyone today worried about tomorrow? As a 
matter of fact, no specific evidence was adduced during the 
debate to prove that the Army was asking for excessive funding. 
On the other hand, there was no shortage of significant dark 
hints. 
  Those who object to the 18 trillion speak of the military 
department's inability to properly manage the funds appropriated 
for defense, but it all boils down to accusations of "inflated 
corps of generals." There are no counterarguments at the level 
of professional and comprehensive analysis. Just emotions. 
Meanwhile, the situation among the troops is verging on the 
critical in many instances. Here is just one "sore spot." Much 
has been said about the nuclear missile-carrying Northern Fleet. 
Way back in August last year, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA wrote about the 
lamentable situation in the fleet, which is bearing the full 
brunt of the principle of "surplus financing." One can imagine 
the impact of the "shorn" budget on the combat ranks of a fleet 
which used to be one of the world's mightiest. 
  I will not even attempt to explain the stubbornness with 
which some deputies and ministers are trying to literally finish 
off both the country's defense industry and the Armed Forces 
themselves. In the course of private conversations they display 
absolute understanding of the problems currently facing the Army 
and the military-industrial complex but, when it comes to 
decisionmaking time, certain corporate considerations of 
"big-time politics" seem to gain the upper hand. Then 
everything becomes simple -- blame all the failures of economic 
reform on the insatiable appetite of the "military monster." 
After all, nobody suggested the idea of maintaining the 
country's defense capability at exactly the level of the sum 
contained in the government's budget. Let backstage passions 
rage, let lobbyists tear each other's shirts off, but a simple 
point must be obvious to all deputies: The Army (whether 
reformed or unreformed) cannot be maintained on starvation 
rations. It is impossible to rush into the nuclear magazine 
with "shock therapy" mentality. Unfortunately, if we were to 
judge by the results of the vote, at least 80 State Duma 
deputies believe that this can be done. 
  "This is both a strategic and a political defeat," I was 
told 
by Aleksandr Piskunov, deputy chairman of the Committee for 
Defense, after the sitting. "At best, the second reading will 
add just 1-2 trillion to the defense budget, which will not 
solve the problem." 
  Even though Aleksandr Aleksandrovich did not explain who had 
been defeated, it is clear that it was neither the military 
department nor the Army. A temporary gain at the expense of 
Russia's defense might will hardly improve the country's ailing 
economy, and the loss will not be long in coming: The Army, put 
on financial starvation rations, will hardly be able to remain a 
factor of stability in the state.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolai Burbyga: "Development of `Intellectual' </F>
Weapons One of the Main Military-Technical Priorities"] 
  [Text] The first session of the presidium of the Russian 
Academy of Missile and Artillery Science, recently resurrected 
by an edict of the Russian president, has been held in Moscow. 
  First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin stressed that 
this academy is designed to be an important organ uniting 
leading scientists of various specialities engaged in developing 
promising technologies for arms systems using artillery and 
missile weapons. Among the military-technical projects which are 
being implemented first place goes to the creation of 
"intellectual" weapons systems capable of striking primarily the 
"nerve centers" of the other side's armed forces and taking out 
the enemy's complex equipment.

  [Text] Tashkent 16 May -- Uzbekistan's President Islam 
Karimov began his first official state visit to Japan on Monday 
[16 May]. On the eve of the visit Karimov told journalists that 
long ago the great silk road, which connected the east with the 
west, established the first links between the ancient Uzbek 
state and Japan. Now life itself prompts to the two nations to 
strengthen their ties and give them a more substantive 
development. 
  During the visit of the head of the Uzbek state to Japan, he 
will hold talks with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and will be 
received by Emperor Akihito. The two countries are expected to 
sign a number of intergovernmental agreements in several fields 
of bilateral cooperation.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Golovnin] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo 16 May TASS -- Uzbekistan's President Islam 
Karimov comes to Tokyo in the hope of restoring ancient links 
with Japan, which originated at the time of the Great Silk Road, 
which connected the East with the West. President Karimov has 
taken with him to Japan more than ten projects of bilateral 
cooperation designed to lay the groundwork for new economic 
relations between the two countries. 
  President Karimov is accompanied on the trip by Deputy Prime 
Minister Otkir Sultanov and Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar 
Saidkasymov. 
  Under the Japanese diplomatic classification, the Uzbek 
president's visit falls under the heading of "official business" 
visits, and therefore the head of Uzbek state will be 
accommodated in a hotel and not in the official residence for 
top guests of the state. But this will not affect the level of 
reception in any other way. Karimov will hold talks with Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata on 19 May and will be received by Emperor 
Akihito. He will meet representatives of the Japanese business 
community. 
  The two countries are expected to sign a joint document, 
although Tokyo, pressed for time, has been unable to prepare 
specific proposals for economic assistance to Tashkent. 
  Karimov is due to spend the last part of his visit in the 
ancient Japanese capital of Kyoto, the "finishing point" of the 
Great Silk Road, which linked Europe with the Far East via 
Central Asia. The museums and temples of this ancient city keep 
exhibits which were brought by the merchants and pilgrims from 
what is now Uzbekistan more than 1500 years ago. 
  The main objective of the visit is of course to establish 
business links and attract Japanese capital and investments. 
Last year, the volume of trade between the two countries 
amounted to a mere $30 million, mainly from trade in Uzbek 
cotton and natural gas in exchange for Japanese computers and 
equipment. Islam Karimov told journalists ahead of the visit 
that Tashkent has prepared at least a dozen projects aimed at 
expanding cooperation including in the field of ecological 
normalisation of the Aral Sea and the improvement of water 
supplies. Certain funds will be allocated for the purpose along 
the line of the Japanese governmental assistance to developing 
countries. 
  Prospects for major private investments are less promising 
since Uzbekistan has not yet become a promising market for the 
Japanese companies, according to Japan's Charge d'Affaires Kozi 
Hino. The Japanese diplomat pointed to Uzbekistan's high taxes 
on foreign businesses and the absence of effective joint 
enterprises in Uzbekistan as the main obstacles. Business links 
are further impeded by the fact that Tashkent, unlike Alma Ata 
[Almaty], has not yet signed an agreement with the International 
Monetary Fund which conditions the signing on the introduction 
of tough restrictions on budget spending in Uzbekistan and a 
tougher control over the currency and financial system. 
  Islam Karimov has already told Japanese journalists that he 
sees the building of an oil and gas pipelines across Kazakhstan 
and China to the Pacific coast as a priority in cooperation with 
Tokyo. Other plans include the building of a railway to China 
via Urumqi, and the building of a highway and a railway from 
Uzbekistan via Afghanistan to Pakistan's port of Karachi. Most 
of these initiatives appear romantic enough, but Tokyo does not 
conceal its interest in the gradual expansion of contacts with 
Uzbekistan, taking into account its important strategic location 
in Central Asia, which, according to Kozi Hino, Japan cannot 
ignore in the context of its continuating territorial dispute 
with Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by GOLOS ARMENII special correspondent in </F>
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic A. Beglaryan: "On the Bishkek Meeting 
Results"] 
  [Text] NKR [Nagorno-Karabakh Republic] Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Arkadiy Gukasyan held a briefing on the results of the 
Bishkek meeting. The minister appraised as positive the 
following points: First, the realization that a political 
solution to the Karabakh problem is impossible without a 
guaranteed cease-fire; second, that it is simply impossible to 
stop the bloodshed without bringing in peacekeeping forces; and 
third, that there will be no progress in the resolution of the 
problem until Nagorno-Karabakh is recognized as a party to the 
conflict. A. Gukasyan noted that declarations should now give 
way to concrete cease-fire mechanisms and a guarantee of the 
nonresumption of military actions. In the opinion of the NKR 
head of foreign affairs, this mechanism should include the 
following components: the signing of a cease-fire agreement 
between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh (preferably with the 
participation of Russia and the CSCE Minsk Group); the fixing of 
the contiguity line; the symmetric withdrawal of conflicting 
parties' forces; maintenance on the front line of a minimal 
armed contingent necessary for defense but insufficient for an 
offensive; and so on. 
  The following steps are necessary in the political sphere: 
lift the communications blockade and provide guarantees that new 
ones will not be possible, and discuss the issue of political 
status, which should be resolved within the framework of a CSCE 
conference. According to A. Gukasyan, it could be foreseen from 
the very beginning that Azerbaijan would not sign the document, 
because it sent the second-ranking person in its parliament to 
the meeting. As is known, a few days ago the Republic of 
Azerbaijan leadership did indeed sign a protocol after making 
two changes to it: replacing the expressions "occupied 
territories" with "seized," and "bringing in observers" with 
"bringing in international observers." However, despite the NKR 
Ministry of Foreign Affair's requests to get a copy of the 
signed protocol from Kazimirov, it still has not been received. 
  "I cannot preclude the possibility that Guliyev has indeed 
signed the protocol;" said the minister, "however, we should not 
draw far-reaching conclusions. The Bishkek protocol calls for 
actions but does not go into detail on the implementation of the 
points it contains," continued A. Gukasyan. The minister did not 
preclude the possibility that the signed document may be another 
tactical move on the part of Azerbaijan. In the minister's 
opinion, now is the right moment to bring the Russian and CSCE 
initiatives closer together.

  [Text] The press service of the Karabakh defense forces 
says that in the past 24 hours fighting continued in the Agdam 
and Mardakert directions of the Armenian-Azeri theater of 
operations. 
  According to the press service, Azeri forces attempted, 
Thursday evening, to break the line of Karabakh defenses near 
the village of Yusifdjanly of the Agdamski District only to be 
driven back to their former positions Friday [13 May] morning. 
  Karabakh forces rebuffed several attacks in the north and 
north-east of the Mardakertski District where intelligence 
sources report a continued buildup of Azeri troops and military 
hardware. 
  On Thursday Karabakh forces took control of the village of 
Seisulan of the Mardakertski District. 
  Also on Thursday, at approximately 2030, Azeri forces opened 
rocket fire on the village of Berdashen of Karabakh's 
Martuninski District. According to preliminary counts, two 
women were killed and a dozen villagers received injuries. 
  Chief Serge Arushanyan of the defense forces' press service 
told INTERFAX Friday that Azerbaijan had violated yet another 
cease-fire agreement and would keep doing so until a 
peace-keeping contingent entered the troubled area. The warring 
forces were to have ceased fire at Thursday midnight. 
  In the meantime a well-informed source on the Azeri 
President's staff accused the Armenians of torpedoing the 
cease-fire negotiated Wednesday night by the Armenian and Azeri 
Defense Ministers and the commander of the Karabakh defense 
forces. The source told INTERFAX the Armenians were not ready 
to halt fire. 
  According to a source on the staff of Azerbaijan's Defense 
Ministry, Azeri forces wage trench warfare in Azerbaijan's 
Ter-Terski District which lies in the north-east of the theater 
of operations. Friday morning the Armenians resumed attacks in 
the direction of Ter-Ter. 
  The source said two Armenian tanks and three MICV's [as 
received] were destroyed over the past 24 hours.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdulayeva, </F>
Viktor Shulman] 
  [Text] Baku 13 May TASS -- Important problems pertaining to 
the settlement of the Armenian-Azeri conflict and the 
liquidation of its consequences are being discussed in Baku 
today. 
  At noon, Azeri President Geydar Aliyev met with the chairman 
of the Minsk CSCE group on Nagorno-Karabakh, Jan Eliasson, his 
deputy, Matthias Mosberg and plenipotentiary representative of 
the Russian president and special envoy of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, Vladimir Kazimirov, who arrived in the region on a 
special mission late on 12 May. 
  According to Aliyev, the current meeting in Baku means the 
beginning of a new stage in the Karabakh settlement. He 
believes that recently, the Minsk CSCE group has extended the 
framework of its activities and has taken a more realistic 
approach to the possibilities of the conflict settlement, 
relying on efforts made by all of its member-states. A positive 
assessment was given to its contacts with Russia and the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, in particular, for the purpose of the conflict 
settlement. 
  According to the Azeri president, "this can be regarded as a 
new qualitative level in the peace-keeping process." 
  Aliyev shares the opinion of Eliasson and Kazimirov about 
the 
importance of ceasefire as the necessary condition for the 
process of settlement. "I believe that the cease-fire should be 
followed by concrete practical steps, including immediate 
withdrawal of Armenian armed formations from the occupied 
territories, strengthening measures of confidence and carrying 
out a programme envisaged by CSCE documents and Russia's 
proposals," Aliyev said. He is convinced that there should be 
no interval between these stages, since only on this condition 
real results in the settlement can be achieved. 
  Aliyev pointed out that the signing of the Bishkek protocol 
by Azerbaijan, which was received in Azerbaijan not 
unequivocally, was a correct step leading to cease-fire and the 
creation of conditions for lasting and reliable peace in the 
region, saying that there are the necessary grounds for this 
process. It is calm today in the area of the conflict, he said. 
  "Now we have to see to it that international observers make 
their contribution to what was achieved, taking under control 
the process of demilitarization and the withdrawal of occupying 
troops. This will inspire everyone with confidence that the 
peace-keeping process is irreversible," the Azeri president said.

  [Text] President Geydar Aliyev received CSCE Minsk Group 
Chairman Jan Eliasson and Vladimir Kazimirov, President 
Yeltsin's special envoy, today. Aliyev welcomed his guests and 
said that he highly appreciates the role of the CSCE Minsk Group 
and the Russian Federation in the effort being made to resolve 
the Karabakh dispute. He said: The talks have entered a new 
stage. We have held talks with the leading officials of the 
CSCE Minsk Group and the representatives of the Russian 
Federation on the solution to the Karabakh problem. The 
significance the CSCE Minsk Group and the Russian Federation 
attach to the ending of the Karabakh dispute is in conformity 
with the laws. However, I am convinced that more work can be 
done if the CSCE Minsk Group and the Russian Federation adopt a 
common approach on the solution of the problem. We believe that 
more effective measures have to be taken and an optimal approach 
has to be adopted for the ending of the dispute. 
  Jan Eliasson stressed: We have reached a formative 
[preceding word in English] and responsible era in the effort 
being made to resolve the Karabakh dispute. A new opportunity 
has been created for the solution of that problem. We are 
convinced that a cease-fire must be implemented as the first 
step and then international observers must be sent to the 
disputed zone. We have agreed on those matters with the Russian 
leaders in Moscow and the CSCE's leading officials. We have 
also informed the UN Security Council. A group of international 
observers is ready to leave for the disputed zone. We need 
official approval on that matter. A [words indistinct] is being 
drawn up for the work of the observers. Later, measures will be 
taken in stages. 
  Vladimir Kazimirov said that he highly regards Jan 
Eliasson's 
views. He said: Russia is very interested in the resolution of 
the dispute and the establishment of peace. The sphere of our 
[word indistinct] and relations is very wide. The military 
units must withdraw from the occupied areas and problems related 
to the exchange of prisoners of war, refugees, and other issues 
must be resolved after the cease-fire agreement is implemented. 
  President Aliyev said that he is convinced that the 
initiatives made by the CSCE Minsk Group and the Russian 
Federation will quickly yield results and that the [words 
indistinct] will be realized. 
  Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Azerbaijan National Assembly; 
Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov; and Vefa Gulizade, state adviser 
on foreign policy, attended the meeting.

Viktor Shulman] 
  [Text] Baku 13 May, TASS -- Vladimir Kazimirov, Russia' 
plenipotentiary representatives and special envoy of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, described today's meeting in Baku attended by 
Azeri President Gaydar Aliyev and leaders of the CSCE Minsk 
Group as an event of great importance. 
  "It is not accidental that the world community and all the 
people of good will interested in the cessation of the 
Armenian-Azeri conflict have focused their attention on the 
meeting in Baku," Kazimirov said. In the opinion of the Russian 
envoy, "in any case, a prospect for the continuation of the 
bloodshed should be rejected," he said. 
  Kazimirov welcomed the concept of beginning a peace-keeping 
process from a cease-fire. "The most important thing now is to 
prevent the cease-fire and cessation of military operations from 
being disconnected from the next stage, in other words, to 
prevent the situation from coming to a deadlock, Kazimirov said. 
  "We must ensure the integrity of the process of settlement, 
and strictly consistent actions should be a reliable commitment, 
rather than a promise, by all parties concerned," the Russian 
envoy said. In his opinion, this can be achieved by means of a 
tangible political agreement binding the sides to observe it and 
on which the world community can rely on with certain confidence. 
  According to Kazimirov, the main goal of the Russian side as 
a mediator is to promote reliable, rather than prompt settlement 
of the conflict. The talks between the Azeri president, leaders 
of the Minsk Group and the special envoy of the Russian 
president were held behind closed doors and continued about four 
hours. 
  Late on Friday [13 May], the mediatory mission is leaving 
for 
Yerevan.

"Azerbaijan"] 
  [Text] The Azerbaijani Party of National Independence 
[APNI] has demanded that the Azerbaijani parliament speaker 
should resign. "By signing the Bishkek protocol together with 
Karen Baburyan, representative of the self-proclaimed 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and thus effectively recognizing this 
entity, Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Chairman Rasul Guliyev 
committed an act of national treason that has drastically 
aggravated the sociopolitical situation in the country," the 
statement of the Republic's largest opposition movement says. It 
also emphasized: "Recognizing Russia as the sole mediator in 
the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and signing 
the Bishkek protocol on 8 May, the Azerbaijani authorities have 
ratcheted up tensions in the Republic to a critical point. The 
signing of this document together with the so-called Nagorno- 
Karabakh Republic [NKR] will lead to international recognition 
of the NKR, the introduction of Russian troops into the conflict 
zone, and finally Azerbaijan's loss of control over part of its 
territory. Given that, the APNI states that it does not 
recognize the Bishkek protocol and requests that the National 
Assembly make a decision on the speediest possible dismissal of 
Speaker Rasul Guliyev, who has committed an unconstitutional act 
and overstepped his powers, and also that the president of the 
Republic express his attitude to the document.

ITAR-TASS headline; by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] 
  [Text] Yerevan 16 May TASS -- "Karabakh want to be an 
independent state, although it does not rule out the possibility 
of reunification with Armenia in the future," the Republic's 
Defence Minister Arkadiy Gukasyan said in an interview with the 
newspaper AZG published in Yerevan, capital of Armenia. 
[sentence as received] 
  Gukasyan said Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh are fully 
independent of each other in their foreign political activity, 
which does not rule out coordination of certain positions. The 
views of Yerevan and Stepanakert differ on a number of points, 
but Armenia does not pressure Karabakh at all, the minister said. 
  According to Gukasyan, Nagorno-Karabakh republic's foreign 
policy is worked out in Stepanakert, and "if it does not 
coincide with the viewpoint of Armenian authorities, Yerevan 
understands that the Karabakh side must stick to its own view."

belonging to the AZADLYG independent newspaper and demanded that 
the newspaper's employees leave it. The police threatened to 
throw in the street all property of the edition, including 
computers, if its employees did not leave the building 
voluntarily. 
  The police stated that the measure had been carried out 
under 
the order of Baku Mayor Rafael Allakhverdiyev. 
  The Baku Mayor's Office refused to comment on the decision 
of 
the mayor saying he was not present at the office. 
  The AZADLYG was the newspaper of the Azerbaijani People's 
Front (now in the opposition) before summer, 1993. Now the 
newspaper reflects the point of view of the opposition and the 
Azerbaijani People's Front remains one of its sponsors. 
  On the same day the Turan independent news agency and 
several 
other editions which occupy the same building with the AZADLYG 
were demanded to leave it. 
  Editor of the AZADLYG newspaper Gyundyuz Tairli told 
journalists that he considered the actions by the police a a new 
wave of oppressions against independent media.

building of the Tbilisi State Armenian Drama Theater, where 
there was an explosion during a performance today. Speakers at 
the rally said an attempt had been made to wreck the 
centuries-long brotherly relations between the Georgian and the 
Armenian people. They urged not to yield to the provocations of 
the enemies of both peoples and to oppose them with unity and 
joint actions for the sake of peace in the Caucasus. 
  Sandro Kavsadze, chairman of the committee on inter-ethnic

  [Excerpts] A large-scale operation against the criminal 
world was carried out in Tbilisi today. [passage omitted] 
Operations aimed at establishing peace and challenging criminal 
gangs and mafia clans were carried out in eight towns and rayons 
in the Republic. 
  This morning, Tbilisi was completely sealed off. Roadblocks 
were put up at the city's key junctions, and police, security 
and guard units started apprehending crime suspects, 
confiscating fire-arms and explosives from the population and 
unmasking drugs dealers. 
  More than 40 suspects, including 11 people wanted for 
serious 
crimes, were detained by 1000 in the morning. Some 30 automatic 
guns, machine-guns, dozens of hand grenades, pistols and grenade 
launchers were confiscated from citizens and criminals. The 
police discovered 100 stolen cars. A large number of drug 
addicts and dealers were unmasked. The operation is still under 
way. 
  It can be said that operations like this, especially when 
hundreds of law-enforcement officials are involved, can rarely 
be prepared in absolute secrecy. Nevertheless, one can say that 
the criminal world suffered a telling blow. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] As for the fact that 
there is military hardware in the streets, I would like to 
stress that the Ministry of Internal Affairs and its units have 
nothing to do with politics. We are not taking part in 
political discussion. Roadblocks were erected in order to give 
peace to our city. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Georgian and Abkhazian delegations to Moscow 
agreed on the disengagement of forces and the deployment of a 
Commonwealth peacekeeping contingent on the confrontation line 
on the Inguri river. 
  In line with a formal agreement signed Saturday [14 May] 
night, the Georgian and Abkhazian units are to move 12 km away 
from the river and a peacekeeping contingent is to take up 
positions inside the 24-km buffer zone. 
  On Sunday, a member of the Abkhazian delegation and a 
special 
emissary of the chairman of the Abkhazian parliament Andrey 
Djerghenia said Russian troops would most likely serve on the 
disengagement force. 
  He said the 2,500 to 3,000 strong contingent would be 
introduced before the end of May. Russian units deployed in 
Abkhazia would make part of it. 
  On Georgian demand, peacekeepers would patrol the Kodor 
canyon after the withdrawal from it of Georgian forces, 
Djerghenia said. 
  According to Djerghenia, the introduction of a peacekeeping 
contingent into Abkhazia paved a way to the repatriation of 
refugees, first of all to the Galski District. 
  In Moscow, the Georgian and Abkhazian negotiators agreed to 
form a joint commission on practical problems in the fields of 
power production, transport and comunication, environmental 
protection, etc. The four-member commission would be expected 
to start work on 1 June in Sochi. 
  The delegations agreed to discuss the status of Abkhazia 
next 
month in Geneva.

  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze says that any 
refusal to sign an agreement on cease-fire and troop 
disengagement with Abkhazia during peace talks in Moscow would 
mean that Georgia was opting for a military solution. 
  In a televised interview late on Saturday [14 May], he said 
that "this could not be justified either from the point of our 
possibilities or morally." 
  Shevardnadze rejected opposition charges saying the Saturday 
peace deal infringed on Georgia's territorial integrity. "There 
is no word about Abkhazian sovereignty or statehood in the 
paper," he said. 
  This problem, he said, is to be solved at a later stage, and 
Abkhazia shall be given a new political status but within 
Georgia itself. 
  Nor did he accept one other allegation saying Russia wanted 
to send troops into the region to assert Abkhazia's independence 
and secession from Georgia. He expressed confidence about 
recovering the region soon. 
  Shevardnadze said that although he raised the question of a 
confidence vote in the head of state and transfer of power to 
parliament at private hearings on Friday, the deputies had not 
enough courage to discuss it. He spoke of staying away from the 
Saturday session to help them take a decision "but they failed 
to do so". 
  Shevardnadze said he was once again convinced how fatal it 
would be to transfer power to the incumbent parliament. 
  Meanwhile, Georgian deputes after two days of debates on 
Friday and Saturday have failed to reach any agreement what is 
to be done with the Moscow peace deal which provides for the 
disengagement of the warring sides and introduction of 
peacekeepers into a buffer zone along the Ingur river. 
  Our correspondent says it appears that the parliamentary 
resolution banning the Georgian delegation to sign any documents 
in Moscow has no legal force. By law, it is the country's head 
of state who is vested with powers to conduct negotiations or 
sign any papers on Georgia's behalf. 
  This must have been an eye opener to many deputies who would 
not have continued this pointless dispute for two days in a row 
otherwise, Deputy Speaker Vakhtang Rcheulishvili who leads a 
parliamentary majority supporting Shevardnadze told INTERFAX. 
  However, opposition leader Boris Kakubava disagrees. In an 
interview with Interfax, he said that the government's dismissal 
of the parliamentary resolution amounted to its disregard of the 
law. In his words, there can be no question of democracy in 
Georgia once a capitulatory deal has been signed in Moscow. 
  On the agreement itself, Kakubava said it helped Abkhazia to 
legitimize the genocide against the Georgian people and write 
off thousands of lost lives. "Our organization, the Alliance of 
the Liberation of Abkhazia expressing the interests of most 
refugees from Abkhazia is not going to put up with this," he 
said adding "we have our own way of how to return to Abkhazia." 
  The army will obey any orders from commander-in-chief and 
head of state Eduard Shevardnadze, a defence ministry spokesman 
in Tbilisi told Interfax. Troops and weaponry will be pulled 
back from the Ingur river and a buffer zone for peacekeepers set 
up, he said.

  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze told a closed 
parliamentary meeting Friday [13 May] that he would have to 
resign as head of state, deputy Tengiz Sigua told journalists. 
  Commenting on his decision, Shevardnadze said that if an 
agreement on a settlement in Abkhazia was not signed, Abkhazians 
would start to shell Zugdidi, Western Georgia. 
  According to Sigua, not only the parliamentary opposition, 
but also a number of representatives of the majority usually 
supporting Shevardnadze this time opposed his proposal to sign 
the Georgian-Abkhazian agreement on settlement in Abkhazia. In 
particular, deputy Nodar Natadze said that if the agreement was 
signed as it was, it would mean Tbilisi's complete capitulation 
before Abkhazian leaders. 
  Earlier this afternoon, deputies prohibited the Georgian 
delegation in Moscow from signing any documents during 
negotiations with Abkhazia until a special parliamentary 
decision had been taken. The ban was caused by unacceptable 
concessions envisioned by the agreement, which was planned to be 
signed in Moscow Friday. 
  However, parliamentary sources in Tbilisi reported that the 
ban was of a recommendatory character. Though as many as 88 
deputies voted in favor of the decision, it was insufficient for 
a qualified majority of 112 votes. The Georgian parliament is 
expected to continue the discussion of the Georgian-Abkhazian 
settlement agreement Saturday, 14 May.

clarifying an earlier item from there, which said that Eduard 
Shevardnadze had resigned. 
  Well, he has not resigned, the RIA agency reports. He has 
proposed a switch to a different form of government. An agency 
correspondent was told by someone in Shevardnadze's entourage 
that an address by the head of the Georgian state at a closed

  [Text] Today's special session of the Georgian parliament 
debated the supreme legislative body's protocol decision 
[protokolnoye resheniye] adopted by a majority of votes 
yesterday that does not allow the Georgian delegation to sign 
any documents at the Moscow talks on the Abkhazian conflict. 
  During today's session, a number of parliamentarians put 
forward the issue of stripping the head of state of his special 
powers relating to reaching a settlement in Abkhazia. However, 
owing to the absence of the quorum at the evening sitting, the 
issue was not put to the vote. 
  Since some deputies believed the protocol decision adopted 
yesterday had no legal power, a proposal was made firstly to 
hold a vote on stripping the head of state of his powers 
regarding Abkhazia and then vote for a second time on 
yesterday's protocol decision. 
  This resulted in heated debate among deputies, which 
signaled 
the end of the session.

  [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian Supreme Council 
chairman and head of state, met James Franklin Collins, a U.S. 
State Department envoy, the chief coordinator of relations with 
the newly-created independent states [name and title as 
received]. The meeting was attended by Kent Brown, the U.S. 
ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Georgia, 
Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze; Valeriy 
Vashakidze, the chairman of the committee for Refugees and 
Displaced People, and other officials. 
  I am happy to get yet another opportunity to demonstrate 
support for Georgian democracy and the progressive course taken 
by the Georgian Government, said James Franklin Collins. The 
guest regarded as useful the discussion he had had with the 
Georgian head of state over current difficulties in Georgia, 
basically on the issue of retaining the territorial integrity of 
Georgia. We have repeatedly expressed our political support 
over this issue, he said. 
  Members of the U.S. State Department delegation have 
emphasized that the Abkhazian issue is a very difficult 
political and humanitarian issue. Therefore, the United States 
has not and will not spare efforts to draw the attention of the 
world community to democratic processes under way in Georgia. 
We can assure you that the United States has a significant 
interest in a democratic Georgia, they said. 
  The head of state expressed special gratitude for the visit 
of the U.S. delegation and emphasized the importance of meetings 
held in various ministries, departments, and organizations. He 
said, in particular, that this was the implementation of 
agreements on bilateral cooperation signed in Washington. Each 
step from your side is of a vital importance for Georgia, said 
the head of state in conclusion.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 13 May -- The Georgian Parliament is 
discussing the Georgian-Abkhaz draft agreement. Eduard 
Shevardnadze is not attending the session despite the deputies' 
call on him to do so. His absence was supposedly justified by 
the fact that he was meeting a U.S. delegation, but this turned 
out to be untrue. 
  The draft envisages separation of the sides, a cease-fire, 
and the introduction of peacekeeping forces along the 
confrontation line. The draft caused a protest from not only 
the opposition but the governing majority as well, for the 
following reasons: 
  A. The draft envisages introduction of peacekeeping forces 
not throughout the whole Abkhaz territory but solely along the 
Enguri River; 
  B. The draft envisages withdrawal of the Georgian Army 
formations from the Kodori gorge, which is the only base for the 
Georgian armed forces in Abkhazia; 
  C. Peacekeeping forces will not be responsible for the 
defense of the refugees, which means that the refugees will not 
be able to return to Abkhazia. 
  The leader of Abkhazia's Liberation Organization, Boris 
Kakubava, demanded Shevardnadze's immediate resignation and 
called his supporters traitors to the country. 
  Opposition members put to a vote the draft resolution, which 
forbids the Georgian delegation to sign any document in Moscow 
before the Georgian Parliament makes a decision. A 
parliamentary majority then left the hall, resulting in there 
being no quorum, but the issue was still put to vote. 
  The decision was adopted not in the form of a resolution, 
but 
a recommendation, which enables the Georgian delegation to sign 
the agreement as a recommendation, which has no legal force. 
  The situation remains tense.

  [Text] Tbilisi 13 [May] -- Talking to an IBERIA news agency 
correspondent, a deputy of the Georgian parliament, Nodar 
Natadze said a draft agreement on a cease-fire and separation of 
forces worked up during current Abkhaz-Georgian talks in Moscow 
is a shameful and capitulatory document. 
  Nodar Natadze said that the UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali's change of stance is difficult to understand. 
Also difficult to understand is Georgian Head of State Eduard 
Shevardnadze's role in the issue.

  [Text] A statement by the parliamentary majority: 
  On 13 May, 88 deputies unanimously passed a protocol 
resolution in the absence of quorum at a closed session of the 
parliament. This resolution demanded that the delegation 
authorized to hold meetings on the Abkhazian issue in Moscow not 
sign any agreement or memoranda without the parliament's 
consent. Another 39 deputies associated themselves with the 
resolution later. 
  According to legislation currently in force in Georgia, a 
protocol resolution has no juridical power. Namely, it is not 
recognized by the Law on State Authorities. It can neither be 
called an official resolution because a required procedure has 
not been accomplished. However, this decision has a political 
significance because it demonstrates the attitude of members of 
parliament towards the document, some articles of which are 
painful for the Georgian party. 
  Meanwhile, a considerable part of deputies regards an 
overall 
wreck of the talks as impossible. Two days of debates have 
demonstrated that the parliament failed to take responsibility 
for the process of talks. Besides, we take into consideration 
that the head of state received important guarantees, which give 
hope for the favorable development of the process for us. 
  We believe the only correct way out in the present critical 
circumstances is the head of state's action on the authority 
conferred to him by law. 
  We believe today a real way to secure a dignified return of 
refugees to Abkhazia and a final restoration of Georgia's 
territorial integrity is through cooperation with Russia, which 
will become a basis for the levers of the collective security of 
the CIS countries. 
  We believe the United Nations, which has been actively 
involved in the settlement of the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict since 
the very beginning, will not spare efforts to ensure the 
implementation of its peacekeeping mission in Abkhazia is in 
full accordance with paragraphs of the UN Charter and the 
interest of the Georgian statehood. We also pin hopes on the 
CSCE participation in the peaceful settlement of this conflict. 
  The process has started and its cessation could only bring 
our state to a chaos and territorial disintegration.

  [Text] James Franklin Collins, The U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's assistant and chief coordinator of 
relations with the newly-created independent states [name and

was met by Kent Brown, the U.S. ambassador in Georgia, Georgian 
Foreign Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze, and other officials. 
  [Begin Collins recording, in English with superimposed 
Georgian translation] I have arrived in Tbilisi to speak to 
Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian head of state, and assure him 
of our support. I also want to make my own contribution to the 
settlement of the Abkhazian conflict. I am sure that Eduard 
Shevardnadze feels this support and he makes all efforts to 
reach a political [word indistinct] and further economic 
development. [end recording] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Later, the U.S. delegation had 
a 
meeting with the Georgian foreign minister during which the 
parties spoke about the current difficult political and economic 
situation in Georgia, humanitarian aid for Georgia, and the 
Abkhazian issue. 
  [Begin Chikvaidze recording] The current situation and 
circumstances in Abkhazia were still the chief issue at the 
meeting. They have eagerly demonstrated their viewpoint on this 
issue. They want to provide maximum help to Georgia. There is 
no second thought about the preservation of Georgia's 
territorial integrity. They wanted to know if any progress was 
observed in the issue of Abkhazia's political status. I 
revealed our position to them. As for the latest talks about an 
incredible formula of an ostensible alliance of two countries, 
Abkhazia and Georgia, we rule this out categorically. I have 
told them that the only thing we could consent to was what 
Abkhazia had had before, an autonomous republic and Georgians 
and Abkhazians living side by side as they used to, and we will 
not go beyond this. [end recording]

  [Text] Tbilisi, 14 May (AFP) -- Several armored cars took 
up positions Saturday in the Georgian capital Tbilisi ahead of a 
debate in parliament on President Eduard Shevardnadze's 
challenge to deputies to abolish the post of presidency. 
  The armored cars were reinforcing police checkpoints already 
in place for several days in the center of the town, witnesses 
said. 
  Shevardnadze submitted Friday [13 May] his resignation and 
proposed abolishing the presidency to protest the deputies' 
refusal to ratify an accord towards settling the conflict with 
the separatist republic of Abkhazia in western Georgia. 
  Ramaz Sakavarelidze, Shevardnadze's press officer, quoted by 
the Georgia news agency IPRINDA said that Shevardnadze would 
remain parliamentary speaker, a post to which he was elected in 
October 1992. 
  Shevardnadze has been head of state since his election in 
November 1992. 
  The deputies fear the accord will authorize the secession of 
Abkhazia. The accord, to be signed Sunday by Georgian and 
Abkhazian delegations in Moscow, calls for deploying 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) troops in a 
12-kilometre (7.2 mile) security zone separating Abkhazia from 
the rest of Georgia. 
  Georgia has been hit since becoming independent in 1991 by a 
series of political crises, including two civil wars and the 
Abkhazian secession struggle, at a time when the national 
economy is in ruins.

Abkhazia, gathered in front of the Georgian parliament today. 
They wrote a statement that was later read at the evening 
sitting of parliament. The statement demands that the 
Georgian-Abkhaz agreement should not be signed and yesterday's 
decision by parliament should be complied with. In the case of 
the opposite happening, a hunger-strike would be staged outside

  [Text] Today Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia 
received an EBRD delegation led by (Jonathan Roberts). The 
meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Zurab 
Kervalishvili. 
  The bank's seven representatives and 11 consultants have 
spent three weeks working in Georgia. Mr (Jonathan Roberts) 
said their task was to gather full information on the situation 
in Georgia and report to the bank's board, which is to meet in 
the first week of July. 
  The conversation outlined the main aspects of the assistance 
program for Georgia. These include restoring Georgia's energy 
potential, developing the transport industry and 
telecommunications. Georgia will receive vital credits if it 
takes into account World Bank, IMF, and EBRD recommendations 
which envisage raising tariffs to world levels. 
  It was noted that a number of necessary laws still did not 
exist. 
  The prime minister thanked guests for their fruitful work 
and 
expressed the hope that it would be followed by tangible 
assistance. Reviving the country's industry depends on the 
development of power engineering and therefore it should be 
given special attention. As for the transition to the market 
economy, it is an irreversible process.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk told Friday 
Ukrainian journalists that from the end of May US ballistic 
missiles would not be targeted at the republic. He said he 
obtained the information from U.S. officials. 
  Kravchuk said that for its part, Ukraine would also observe 
the three-partite statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the 
United States and Russia and continue deactivation of the 
strategic missiles situated on its territory. 
  Kravchuk said that all 46 SS-24 strategic missiles have been 
deactivated in Ukraine. All in all, there are 176 strategic 
missiles on the territory of the republic. 
  Kravchuk said that earlier Ukrainian warheads "were targeted 
at the United States, but we did not control them". 
  According to statements by the republic's leaders, Ukraine 
is 
unable technically to change the flight tasks for the missiles 
being deployed by Russia. But they could be launched from the 
territory of Ukraine only with consent of the republic's 
president. 
  According to US Ambassador in Kiev, William Green Miller, 
Ukrainian officials confirmed to him that all strategic missiles 
on the republic's territory are not targeted at the United 
States.

  [Text] A ceremonial signing of a memorandum on mutual 
understanding between the governments of Ukraine and the United 
States of America about the transfer of missile equipment and 
technologies took place in the White House. Ukraine's Deputy 
Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov and U.S. Vice President Al Gore 
signed the document. 
  Proceeding from a common interest in maintaining and 
consolidating international peace and security, says the 
document, the governments of both countries are ready to jointly 
counteract the proliferation of missile equipment and 
technologies which could contribute to the elaboration of 
acquisition of missile systems for delivering mass annihilation 
weapons. 
  The memorandum envisages a package of measures aimed at 
strict control over the proliferation of missile technologies, 
the carrying out of joint inspections and consultations in this 
field, and exchange of relevant data in case missile equipment 
and technologies are transferred. 
  Meanwhile, the memorandum emphasizes that the regime of 
control over the missile technologies rules out the creation of 
obstacles in the way of creating Ukraine's national space 
program or its cooperation with other missile and space states 
in this sphere. 
  By signing this document the United States of America, as a 
matter of fact, recognized Ukraine's just interests in 
preserving and further promoting the scientific, technological 
and production capacity of Ukraine in the missile and space 
field. This agreement also means that Ukraine is recognized as 
an equal participant in international cooperation and a subject 
of the world aerospace market. 
  The second important result of the work done by the 
Ukrainian 
delegation, led by Valeriy Shmarov, in the U.S. capital was the 
adoption of a joint statement in which the governments of both 
countries reaffirm their loyalty to building relations of 
partnership, mutual trust and respect, and further developing 
new relations in the cause of security and defense. 
  Recognizing Ukraine's positive contribution to the cause of 
nuclear disarmament, the specific steps toward deactivating 
missile installations in Ukraine and the implementation of the 
trilateral statement as a whole, the Government of the United 
States of America, in response, announced that after 30 May this 
year the U.S. strategic missiles will no longer be targeted at 
Ukraine. 
  This document also emphasizes that as from this date the 
U.S. 
missiles will not be targeted at the territories of other 
countries, which will testify to the lessening of nuclear threat 
in the world as a whole. 
  Speaking at the signing ceremony in the White House, U.S. 
Vice President Al Gore underlined that by its actions in many 
fields over the year Ukraine has proved that it is a reliable 
and responsible partner. 
  The adoption and signing of these important 
Ukrainian-American documents is yet another concrete step toward 
fulfilling the program of a broad development of bilateral 
relations signed by the presidents of Ukraine and the USA Leonid 
Kravchuk and Bill Clinton. An agreement was achieved on further 
contacts between both sides. 
  On behalf of the president and the government of our state 
Valeriy Shmarov invited the U.S. Vice President to visit Ukraine 
at a time convenient to him. The invitation was accepted with 
gratitude.

  [Text] Talking to newsmen in Simferopol, the chairman of 
the Crimean Supreme Soviet Sergey [Serhiy] Tsekov refused to 
believe that the Ukrainian parliament would kill Crimean 
autonomy. Tsekov felt there were a sufficient number of 
sober-minded individuals among the Ukrainian lawmakers and they 
were knowledgeable about the Crimean problems. If, however, the 
Ukrainian parliament moved to kill Crimean autonomy, Tsekov 
said, the peninsula would break off all relations with Kiev. 
  And moves to sever relations were not likely to be peaceful, 
he said. 
  According to Tsekov, Leonid Kravchuk could play up the 
Crimean problem to win support in Ukraine's western provinces. 
  First of all, Tsekov said, the Crimean parliament must 
concentrate efforts on independent statehood, and then -- on the 
restoration of unity with Russia. That was what the lawmakers 
called for before they were elected, Tsekov said, and they had 
to meet their electoral pledges. 
  In Tsekov's view, the first thing the parliament must do, 
was 
to restore the Constitution of May 6, 1992 which said Crimea's 
relations with Ukraine were limited to the treaty on bilateral 
relations. 
  Next, Tsekov said, the peninsula's executive and legislative 
branches would have to send a joint mission to Kiev. The 
mission would try to convince the Ukrainian leaders of the need 
to address the Crimean problem. 
  According to Tsekov, the Constitution of May 6, 1992 could 
be 
restored in a matter of two weeks, after a discussion by 
parliament. 
  Tsekov said Crimea would first sign a treaty of economic 
union with Moscow, and treaties on a political and military 
union would soon follow one after the other. 
  A treaty on a military and political union could, however, 
be 
signed between Russia, on the one hand, and Crimea and Ukraine, 
on the other. In Tsekov's view, Kiev would sooner or later come 
to realize the necessity of building a union, if not a 
confederation or federation, with Russia. 
  The territorial integrity of the Republic of Crimea must be 
insured in the context of the Commonwealth's Collective Security 
Treaty but, Tsekov said, Crimea must have its own Guards.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Moscow in Russian to 
Tajikistan at 1600 GMT on 12 May, in its "Slavyanka" program of 
the Russian Defense Ministry, broadcasts a 12-minute segment on 
naval affairs devoted to the Black Sea Fleet. An unidentified 
reporter begins his report by saying that he has just returned 
from Sevastopol, where he saw no sign of "interethnic enmity" 
either among the inhabitants of the Crimea or between the 
sailors of the Ukrainian navy and the Black Sea Fleet. The 
Fleet issue has become a media football, he says, adding: "The 
politicians have decided that the Black Sea Fleet is a joint 
one." 
  But the sailors cannot understand this, he goes on. "The 
Fleet's traditions," the reporter notes, "like the pro-Russian 
leanings in the Crimea, seem to be stronger than political 
decisions. For the men of the Black Sea Fleet, and not only for 
them, it is clear today that the division of the Fleet will lead 
to its destruction. It is clear that the Ukraine cannot 
maintain the Fleet." There have been no new ships for years, he 
notes, and the youngest vessels are 17-18 years old. "The Black 
Sea Fleet is supplied by the Russian Ministry of Defence," the 
reporter concludes. 
  The next item in the Black Sea Fleet program concerns the 
patriotic uplift given to the sailors by such measures as the 
adoption of individual vessels by Russian cities and the 
consequent provision of apartments in those cities for the 
sailors. An unidentified reporter notes that both Russia and 
Ukraine have their own views on the Black Sea Fleet's future, 
but that the opinion of a third party, the Crimean Government, 
cannot be ignored. The reporter says that he met with Yevgeniy 
Saburov, deputy prime minister of the Crimean Republic. "Our 
conversation followed a somewhat unexpected course," the 
reporter notes. "It seems that Yevgeniy Saburov regards the 
Black Sea Fleet as a factor in the Crimea's economic stability. 
Judge for yourselves." 
  The reporter then plays a recording of Saburov saying: "I 
was 
very happy about the decision that Russia has its own legal base 
for the Black Sea Fleet in accordance with all the agreements. 
That is a very good decision. It looks as though it really 
will be implemented. We have already become used to promises 
being given, treaties being signed, and then nothing being 
carried out. Let us hope that this time the decision will be 
implemented. 
  "Apart from that, I must say that a very big part here is 
played, in my opinion, not by the military aspect, but by the 
economic aspect. Who will be selling any written-off ships? 
Who will the rent be paid to? And the reluctance of the 
Ukrainian side to allow the Crimea into the talks on the subject 
really does suggest a mercenary interest in making use of the 
benefits of the Russian proposal. It is only the Ukrainian 
leadership that is not allowing the Crimea in. 
  "In fact, I can see a very large commercial interest here. 
It looks extremely unsavory, it must be said, and in a sense 
incomprehensible. The point is this: For example, if the Crimea 
received the rent, what would it do? It would be a completely 
legal matter, since Sevastopol's sewers, water supply and food 
supply...[Saburov pauses] This money would not go into anyone's 
pocket. It would benefit Sevastopol. It would remain on the 
spot. The decisions must be made to be economically justified 
and serve to benefit Sevastopol, the Fleet, and the families of 
the sailors who live there. Otherwise it will be spent on 
incomprehensible purposes and God knows where." 
  Speaking about the Black Sea Fleet becoming a joint 
possession of the Ukraine and Russia, Saburov says: "A joint 
fleet is out of the question. Of course, we dreamed of coming 
together and of integration. We thought that there would be 
close cooperation between the Slav states. But it isn't 
happening. As for a Ukrainian fleet, without looking at all the 
other aspects of the matter, I just think it is impossible for 
the Ukraine to maintain it. There's only one solution here: It 
must be a Russian fleet." 
  The reporter then asks Rear-Admiral Nikolay Kostrov, deputy 
commander of the Ukraine's Naval Forces, to explain his 
government's actions with regard to the Black Sea Fleet. 
  Kostrov says: "We must not take a narrow view of the 
problem; 
it needs a broader view. Either there are independent states or 
there aren't. If there aren't, then there is no problem. If 
they do actually exist, then one can talk about the subject of 
the Black Sea Fleet. If the Black Sea Fleet exists, then today 
it is legally and politically subordinate to two presidents." 
  The reporter says: Rear-Admiral Nikolay Kostrov also talked 
about the establishment of the Ukraine's naval forces and the 
problems of their structural organization." 
  Kostrov goes on to say: "Our naval forces don't come under 
any agreement at all, incidentally. The Defense Ministry passed 
nothing on about structures for the forces which have been 
formed in a vacuum. There were no structures. There were no 
ships. We accepted the ships that came, newly built, from the 
shipyards. We took on personnel that came from the Ukrainian 
state, and we slowly...[pauses] Russia, unfortunately, is not 
helping us and is trying to put pressure on us and to stop us 
from emerging, since we seem to be out of favor. There are many 
self-seeking things here which transcend the bounds of military 
concepts. There are many far-fetched political attributes that 
have been imposed on the Black Sea Fleet. It is a problem. It 
is all done artificially. Even at the latest meetings of the 
defense ministers -- you know their outcome, a very sad outcome, 
unfortunately. But one cannot act in this way. We must respect 
one another as Slavs. If we have separated, then let us observe 
the sovereignty of Russia and the sovereignty of the Ukraine, 
and respect the armed forces of Russia and the armed forces of 
the Ukraine." 
  Kostrov continues: "I am Russian by nationality, although 
I ws born in the Ukraine. It is my home. I have no other home. 
Why must we now quarrel over nationality? We must draw closer 
together now. Since we have a real existence within the borders 
of sovereign states, we must respect those sovereignties. We 
must help one another rather than increase the front of 
confrontation." 
  The program concludes with a recapitulation of April's 
events 
in Odessa and hope is expressed that the differences between the 
two states will, in the future, be resolved peacefully.

  [Text] The commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Eduard 
Baltin, distrusts the latest agreements on dividing the Black 
Sea Fleet reached between Moscow and Kiev. "As its predecessor, 
the latest agreement will fail to work," he said in an exclusive 
interview with Interfax. 
  Furthermore, Baltin said he is puzzled by Ukraine's 
insistence that the two countries' fleets should share the same 
naval base in Sevastopol. 
  "This runs counter to common sense and has no precedent in 
international practice. Such a situation has already resulted 
in aggravating tensions between Russian and Ukrainian 
servicemen," the Black Sea Fleet commander said. 
  Some Ukrainian naval units stationed in the Crimea, he 
noted, 
have been disconnected from the Fleet's energy system. "The 
Ukrainian Navy's debt to the Fleet has reached 4.5 billion 
rubles. There are no political motives in this. Politics and 
economics must not be confused," the admiral stressed. 
  His fleet has no newly-built ships, Baltin complained. He 
deplored Ukraine's inability to finance the work of the 
shipyards in Nikolayev, and said he hopes that in the near 
future Russia will be able to provide his fleet with modern 
ships from Russian shipyards in the Baltic region and the 
Northern Fleet. 
  In answer to Interfax's question about the fleet's attitude 
to the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, Baltin said: "He is a picturesque personality. 
From the point of view of humour he adds some color and 
animation to the work of the State Duma, but nothing more."

underlined. 
  The Ukrainian Embassy to Russia announced that some 
Ukrainians had found a refuge on Russian trade boats and others

33.7 percent, Germany 11.6 percent, the USA 11.1 percent, Cyprus 
and Switzerland 4.2 percent each, Britain and Poland 2.9 percent 
each. 
  Russian investments in the Ukrainian economy amount to 1.7

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 19 , 2-7 May 94] </F>
  [Text] President Leonid M. Kravchuk signed a decree, which 
makes amendments to his June 12, 1993 Decree "On Measures To 
Reduce Cash Circulation". 
  Considering earlier amendments, which were made by his 
decrees of July 6, 1993, and October 22, 1993 the Decree's 
latest tenor looks like this. 
  With a view to normalize currency regulation and reduce 
money 
emission rates 
  1. All juridical persons in Ukraine, irrespective of their 
proprietorial form status and kinds of activities, as well as 
natural persons including Ukraine's citizens, foreigners and 
stateless persons, who are subject of business activities, 
  -- should effect one-time settling among themselves for 
commodities, works, services and securities, the value of which 
exceeds six minimal wages, on a cash basis only. Banks are 
authorized to supply, within a calendar month, cash to 
enterprises, organizations and institutions, which employ up to 
3,000 personnel, for their current needs, in amounts within 
fifteen minimal wages, and to those, which employ over 3,000 
personnel, in amounts within thirty minimal wages. Cash, which 
is needed for service trips, is not included in the above 
current needs and is supplied by banks in accordance with the 
established order; 
  -- should store cash at their counters within the 
established 
limits. Procedures for cash limits and control over their 
observance are determined by the National Bank of Ukraine; 
  -- are entitled to keep at their cash counters sums in cash, 
which exceed the established limits, only for payments of wages, 
social welfare bonuses, stipends, pensions, and only for 
periods, not greater than three work-days, including the day of 
cash supply by banks. 
  Validity of paragraph 2 of this Article does not extend to 
settling by collective agricultural enterprises and farmers with 
trade organisations and institutions. 
  Provisions of paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article do not 
extend 
to natural persons, who are subjects of business activities. 
  2. Limits for cash balance for juridical persons should be 
set by commercial banks servicing them based on settling data 
submitted by them. In case of such settling data lacking, the 
said limits are set by commercial banks on their own. 
Commercial banks effect cash supply only on presenting to them 
relevant substantiation, and exercise control over cash 
application, as has been specified. 
  3. Juridical and natural persons, who are engaged in 
procurement of agricultural products, wild fruits and berries, 
herbs, waste paper and fabrics, glass containers and scrap from 
the population, as well as juridical persons, who carry out 
mortgage operations, are entitled to get cash to the full extent 
of their settling with the population. 
  Trucking and automotive delivery enterprises and 
organisations (which specialize in rendering transportation 
services), which are engaged in inter-regional carriage, are 
entitled to get cash to pay for fuels, which are purchased 
beyond the boundaries of their location regions. 
  Control over advance sum spending (payments for fuels) is 
exercised by the commercial banks. 
  Sums, which are due to citizens for products, which they 
sell, may be remitted to their savings accounts only of their 
own free will. 
  4. Banks should provide to juridical persons, who are 
engaged in insurance activities, means to pay insurance sums 
(insurance compensations) against insurance agreements of 
voluntary and compulsory insurance, on a non-cash basis, except: 
  -- sums, payable to citizens in cash upon expiration of 
their 
insurance agreements or the agreements' preterm termination; 
  -- compensations payable to citizens in the form of 
insurance 
sums and insurance indemnities. 
  5. Enterprises, institutions and organisations including 
those engaged in trade, which have permanent monetary returns 
and which use them to pay wages, pensions and to purchase 
agricultural products, are entitled to retain cash at their cash 
counters for only three work days preceding payment terms 
without limitations on cash spending. 
  6. Control over observance of this Decree's provisions by 
juridical persons with the exception of commercial banks, and by 
natural persons, who are subjects of business activities, is 
exercised by the commercial banks, state taxation service 
bodies, bodies of the state auditing service and the Ministry of 
the Interior of Ukraine. 
  7. Sales of manufactured goods to citizens by trading 
organisations and other enterprises and organisations, as well 
as settling with natural persons, who deliver for commission 
commodities (for units or batches, irrespective of their kind or 
denomination) in excess of 200 minimal wages, should be effected 
through Ukrainian banks' checks or through remittance of payment 
orders to the depositors' personal accounts. 
  Check issuance by banks and money transfer to the citizens' 
personal accounts in excess of the above stated amount of 
minimal wages, are effected free of charge. 
  8. State taxation inspection bodies, based on materials of 
their audits and documents, submitted to them by the commercial 
banks, state auditing service, Ministry of the Interior of 
Ukraine, the National Bank of Ukraine, should impose financial 
sanctions, in the form of penalties in amounts of excessive 
settling operations or extra-limit cash sums at cash counters, 
on enterprises, institutions and organisations, which are guilty 
of non-observance of this Decree's provisions, irrespective of 
their proprietorial form and kind of activity, as well as on 
natural persons, who are subjects of business activities and who 
are guilty of similar offenses. 
  Liability for violation of requirements stated in paragraph 
2 
of Article 1 of this Decree involving exceeded sums of one-time 
settling is incurred on juridical and natural persons, who paid 
in cash. 
  In case of this Decree's violation by commercial banks, 
financial sanctions in the form of penalties are imposed on them 
at the National Bank's suggestion: 
  -- for cash payment without due reasons, in amounts of sums 
unduly paid. 
  Penalties, provided for by this Article, are levied to the 
state budget as unappealable. 
  9. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine together with the 
National Bank of Ukraine should define procedures for 
implementing this Decree's provisions. 
  [signed] L. Kravchuk, President of Ukraine 
  [dated] Kiev, April 29, 1994

  [Text] Kiev -- President Leonid Kravchuk today visited the 
"Kiev Spring Fair-94" exhibition, which opened at the Sports 
Palace. After Leonid Kravchuk had viewed the exhibits he 
answered journalists' questions. 
  Speaking about the new parliament, Leonid Kravchuk pointed 
out that it is too early to draw a conclusion that the 
parliament has become politicized, because its formation is 
still under way. 
  Assessing a possibility that the parliament will consider 
the 
law on the delimitation of functions between the president and 
the government, Leonid Kravchuk declared that the result of the 
work done by the initiative group is not yet the opinion of the 
parliament and the commissions. "Changing the Constitution is a 
problem, which should be coordinated with the executive bodies 
and the president. The situation with Crimea can serve as an 
example. In 1990 it was granted autonomy. However, there are no 
documents whatsoever that would regulate relations between 
Ukraine and the autonomy. Only in two years' has a document on 
the delimitation of their plenary powers been approved. Over 
this time Crimea has approved so many various decisions that now 
they must be brought in line with the Constitution of Crimea and 
the Constitution of Ukraine. We found ourselves in a difficult 
situation, failing to adopt in 1990 the documents on mutual 
relations between Ukraine and its autonomous part. If now, 
before the election of the president, we again have no documents 
determining relations between the center and the territories, 
the president and the executive structures, we will again find 
ourselves in a difficult situation. It is necessary to 
introduce amendments and additions to the Constitution 
immediately, and not to hold elections for the sake of 
elections. As far as the plenary powers of the president are 
concerned, the executive power should be in one pair of hands: 
If it is in the hands of the president, no premier is needed, 
then this is a presidential state and this will lead to changes 
in the Constitution and laws. If the plenary powers are vested 
in the Cabinet of Ministers, it is necessary to determine its 
status and the status of the president. There is no perpetual 
scheme in this situation and one should proceed from historic 
peculiarities. 
  Replying to a question from a UNIAN correspondent on his 
attitude to the stance taken by Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, Ukraine's 
acting prime minister, toward the Ukrainian Interbank Currency 
Exchange, and on whether the ban on circulation of freely 
convertible currency in Ukraine's monetary market would lead to 
collapse, Leonid Kravchuk, noted: "This issue should be studied. 
Only one currency is in circulation in other countries of the 
world and there is no collapse. As regards misgivings 
concerning a lack of cash, calculations will be made with 
Ukraine's National Bank. In the world, "when a state is a 
state," it has one currency, and it has banks and bureaux de 
change, which can convert any currency "at a fair exchange rate" 
into the national one. When five or six currencies are in 
circulation in the country, you will not bring order to the 
currency system. One should not approach the issue of the 
Ukrainian Interbank Currency Exchange in a simplistic way; one 
should take account of the current situation, all of the "pros" 
and "cons." I am convinced that if we introduce the hryvna in 
accordance with all the rules, all market and financial 
structures will be made to correspond to it, including the 
Ukrainian Interbank Currency Exchange. 
  To a question about what to do to make Ukrainian goods 
appear 
in the shops, which have become known in the world market, 
Leonid Kravchuk noted in particular: "There are two problems: 
to earn money and to pay people for labor in accordance with the 
existing norms. The problem is not a lack of money, but the 
lack of a mechanism to restrain the money earned. There are 
people who receive unearned money and who buy products such as 
foreign-made cars, but those who work cannot receive money. We 
cannot increase pensions and wages on the basis of goods 
produced. We should enliven production, make profits and then 
increase social payments."

  [Text] "Crimean Tatars will have to go a long way to be 
formed as a people and as a state," Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk said at a solemn meeting dedicated to the fifty-year 
anniversary of the deportation of the Crimean-Tatar people in 
Kiev on Saturday [14 May]. 
  He stressed that Ukraine had to face the problem of deported 
peoples alone, although the Ukrainian leadership had addressed 
the CIS states with a request to help it. 
  Kravchuk repeated that the CIS agreement on mutual 
assistance 
with settlement of problems concerning deported peoples signed 
in 1992 had not been ratified by the CIS parliaments and had 
never come into effect. 
  Kravchuk said that migration had become spontaneous. 
Displaced persons often find themselves in Ukraine with no 
means for living since they fail to sell their property for fair 
prices. He urged the Ukrainian parliament to adopt a law which 
will clearly define the status of deported peoples, including 
Crimean Tatars. 
  Deputy Chairman of the Crimean-Tatar parliament, Refat 
Chubarov, called on the Ukrainian leadership to address the UN 
in order to solve the problems of Crimean Tatars. He suggested 
the assistance on the part of the UN would also improve the 
situation in Crimea in general. 
  Chubarov pointed out that the issue could be resolved only 
through joint actions by the Ukrainian and Crimean authorities 
and the Crimean-Tatar parliament. 
  Currently, there are about 250,000 Crimean Tatars living in 
Crimea. In accordance with the quota given to them, Crimean 
Tatars have fourteen seats in the new Crimean parliament.

  [Text] In an interview with INTERFAX Friday [13 May], 
Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy rejected, in no 
uncertain terms, information on Ukrainian troop buildup on the 
Crimean Peninsula. Earlier, the Chairman of the Russian State 
Duma's Commission on Commonwealth Affairs Konstantin Zatulin 
said that Kiev sent mostly residents of its western provinces to 
serve in Crimea and that it had increased to 50,000 the strength 
of its Crimean contingent. 
  Radetskyy did not know where Zatulin found the figure and 
said residents of all provinces were sent to serve in Crimea. 
  According to Radetskyy, the Black Sea Fleet, police force, 
elite police units and paramilitary guards taken together would 
number 50,000.

  [Text] Two more deputy factions have been set up at the 
Crimea Supreme Soviet session. These are the "Reform" faction 
made up of 12 deputies under Vladimir Shevyev, cochairman of the 
Crimean Economic Revival Party, and the 10-seat Agrarian faction 
under Yuriy Velyukh, a well-known Crimean entrepreneur operating 
in the agro-industrial sector. It is expected that yet another 
faction -- "Republic" -- will be set up that will fully support 
the Crimean Tatar Assembly faction. According to observers, it 
may include some deputies from the "Russia" faction. The 
session has also elected chairmen of nine of the Crimea Supreme 
Soviet's 12 standing commissions and formed the parliament's 
Presidium made up of the Supreme Soviet chairman, his two 
deputies, and nine chairmen of Supreme Soviet standing 
commissions.

  [Text] The current first session of Crimea's Supreme 
Soviet registered a "Russia" faction on 12 May. It comprises 47 
deputies, exactly half the parliament. Far from all the 
deputies-members of the "Russia" election bloc, which numbers 
155, joined the faction. In observers' estimates, the fact that 
the Supreme Soviet chairman and his lieutenants will be backing 
the faction, the deputies comprising it will be able to pass any 
decisions (with the exception of constitutional ones) ignoring 
the other parliamentarians' will. "Russia" is the second faction 
of Crimea's new parliament. The first to have been registered 
was the Crimea Tatar People's Assembly faction comprised of 14 
deputies.

  [Text] All proposals concerning amendments to the Ukrainian 
Constitution were only the results of the work of a deputy 
group, which must be coordinated with the executive power, 
including the president. This was stated by Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk in Kiev today when commenting on the draft 
amendments on the reduction of the president's powers. 
  Kravchuk stressed it was necessary to develop a clear 
legislative basis defining the powers of all state bodies. 
Kravchuk said that Crimea was an example of an unsettled 
legislative basis since Crimea had received the autonomy status 
in 1990 with no legislative acts regulating its relations with 
Ukraine. 
  Kravchuk said that after this Kiev had been placed in a very 
difficult situation and had to coordinate decisions on Crimean 
autonomy with the Ukrainian Constitution. "If we come to the 
elections with no documents defining the powers of those who 
will be elected we will be in the same situation as with 
Crimea," Kravchuk suggested. 
  He emphasized that the executive power must be in the hands 
of a single person. "If it is in the hands of the president the 
premier will be of no need. Then it will be a presidential 
state," Kravchuk stated. 
  He confirmed that he would take no moves if the Ukrainian 
parliament did not agree with the proposal to postpone 
presidential elections. 
  Answering a question of a reader of the Ukrainian Youth 
newspaper who had urged Kravchuk to force the parliament to put 
off presidential elections, Kravchuk said he could not act by 
force and violate laws. He suggested that to use force would 
mean to return to totalitarianism. 
  On relations with Moscow, Kravchuk said he was not afraid of 
Russia but would do everything so that "our children do not 
start fighting." Kravchuk believes that the Russian leadership 
supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

  [Text] [No dateline as received] In an interview with a 
UNIAN correspondent today, District Electoral Commission 
Chairman Heorhiy Romanovskyy said preliminary data shows that of 
all the contenders for a Ukrainian presidential candidacy in 
Nikolayev oblast, former premier Leonid Kuchma has collected 
most signatures. There were 8,380 votes in his favor. He is 
followed by Socialist Party leader Oleksandr Moroz, with 5,746 
signatures, Education Minister Petro Talanchuk, with 4,963, 
President Leonid Kravchuk, with 4,011, former economy minister 
Volodymyr Lanovyy, with 2,690, and parliamentary speaker Ivan 
Plyushch, with 2,576. 
  Independent experts point out that the only surprise is the 
third result, that by Ukrainian Education Minister Petro 
Talanchuk. However, they explain it by the somewhat command-like 
manner of signature collection at Nikolayev's teachers' training 
institute, which the minister visited in April.

"Extraordinary Fascism"] 
  [Text] When, in the summer of 1992, Lvov was literally 
covered with leaflets of Ukraine's Social Nationalist Party 
[SNPU], nobody attached any significance to its party emblem 
shaped like a stylized swastika: After all, following the 1991 
putsch, people's anti-communist convictions were attributed to 
their progressive views. 
  The newly created party had at its core members of the 
organization "Rukh [Ukraine's People's Movement for Perestroyka] 
Guards" [Varta Rukhu] who had been trained in martial arts by 
instructor and psychiatrist Yaroslav Andrushkiv, the future 
leader of the party. The "Varta" started its activities with 
guarding rallies and demonstrations as well as the most 
frowned-upon dissidents. 
  Then dissidents became deputies, and rallies ceased to be 
objects of provocations and, eventually, disappeared completely. 
The last straw that exhausted "Varta's" patience in its 
relations with Ukraine's People's Rukh [NRU] was the latter's 
refusal, during the 1991 putsch, to conduct mobilization 
measures for possible resistance. The "Varta" became an 
independent organization and assumed the image of the present 
UNSO [Ukraine's National Self- Defense]. However, it lacked an 
ideological foundation: Patriotism alone was no longer 
sufficient. A new and very dense political spectrum was taking 
shape at a very fast rate. There only remained space at the end 
of that spectrum. 
  The SNPU got the young peoples' confidence in October 1992, 
during the second picketing of the Supreme Council by students. 
At that time, the youth movement had already acquired 
structure: The Union of Ukrainian Youth [SUM], the Students' 
Brotherhood, the "Heritage" [Spadshchyna], and the scout 
organization "Layer" [Plast] had formed and actively functioned. 
There no longer remained sources from which the SNPU could 
recruit dynamic young people, as was the case of the 
aforementioned organizations. 
  Leaders of the SNPU started active work with members and 
leaders of those organizations and, as a result, the 
overwhelming majority of them joined the party, both officially 
and unofficially. The youth organizations, which had until then 
been liberal, became, as if by magic, the arena for internal 
discussions on the primacy of the national idea over everything 
else. The discussions paralyzed the activity of the 
organizations for one or more years, split them, or destroyed 
them. 
  However, centralized control is necessary, including control 
over the property of organizations. By that time, the 
aforementioned organizations (with the exception of the "Layer") 
had been united in the Lvov regional foundation "Young Ukraine" 
[Moloda Ukrayina]. In a short while, representative of the 
Social Nationalist Party for ideological issues Yuriy 
Kryvoruchko became chairman of the foundation's board. 
  After that, a new phase of development started: Almost the 
entire "Heritage" and one of the three local "Ukrainian Afghan 
War Veterans" organizations joined the Social Nationalists. 
However, some young people turned out to be lacking in 
nationalist consciousness and decided not to join the SNPU, for 
example, the SUM. Then the SUM was placed in such conditions 
when it either had to give up its premises or join the party. 
The SUM vacillated too long -- it was simply ousted from the 
foundation. Then the Lion Society [Tovarystvo Leva] was also 
expelled. 
  However, attempts to encroach upon the newspaper POST-POSTUP 
did not end successfully for the SNPU: It failed to take the 
newspaper under its control. Legally, the foundation still 
remains the founder of the newspaper. However, there also 
remains the most influential and prestigious organization 
Students' Brotherhood, which is also the most numerous one. 
  During the holding of the World Ukrainian Students Congress, 
the entire leadership of the SNPU and about a dozen party 
members arrived in Kiev, for the first time in their party 
uniform -- black shirts and with metal emblems. The Latin -- or 
Old Ukrainian -- "N" is crossed vertically by the "I," which 
symbolizes the cornerstone of the party teachings -- the "idea 
of the nation." 
  After a series of the president's incoherent political 
zigzags and the Massandra agreement, the SNPU decided to take 
over the struggle for Ukraine's salvation. At the invitation of 
the Social Nationalists, their proclaimed Committee for the 
Salvation of the Nation and the State was joined by 
ultra-right-wing organizations -- with the exception of UNA 
[Ukrainian Nationalist Assembly]-UNSO, which the Social 
Nationalists did not risk to invite. The Lvov Students 
Brotherhood also decided to respond to the calls by the 
Salvation Committee and joined it. 
  Then some cells -- the largest of them, the Students 
Brotherhood of the Lvov Polytechnic Institute -- declared their 
separate opposition. Following that, the premises occupied by 
the Brotherhood at 12 Hlyboka Street were raided and the 
nonconformists were beaten up. Lvov deputy Parubiy, a member of 
the SNPU, sent away the militia detail that had been summoned. 
In his subsequent interviews, Yuriy Kryvoruchko stated that the 
SNPU had not been involved in the events at 12 Hlyboka Street. 
Such a way of resolving problems was also applied to other 
organizations. 
  Thus, a concise listing of the SNPU actions in Lvov 
looks as follows: 
  1. The report and election conference held by Rukh (in 
the Lort Palace): The interference by the SNPU members into the 
course of its work and the disruption of the conference (threat 
of physical reprisals against Rukh members and the beating up of 
seven persons). 
  2. The Rukh conference at 13 Shevchenko Prospekt 
[Avenue]: The beating up of several Rukh members, a reporter, 
and the municipal militia by the SNPU members. 
  3. The beating up by the SNPU members of Myroslav 
Soldat (chairman of the SUM) and Andriy Sokolov (deputy chairman 
of the SUM), as well as of several other SUM members. The SUM 
was physically evicted from the building at 23 Shevchenko 
Prospekt. 
  4. The beating up of several members of the "Lion 
Society" and the physical eviction of the organization from the 
building at 23 Shevchenko Prospekt. 
  5. The beating up by the SNPU members of an official of 
the "Fund for Social Adaptation of Young People," subordinated 
to the Cabinet of Ministers, and the eviction of the 
organization from the building at 23 Shevchenko Prospekt. 
  6. Actions by members of the SNPU (approximately 30 
persons altogether) in the building of the Lvov Oblast 
Organization of the Ukrainian Republican Party (there were 
threats to hang O. Pavlyshyn [Republican Party activist] and to 
shoot M. Horyn [chairman of the Ukrainian Republican Party]). 
  7. Pressure upon Lvov's mayor Mr. Shpitser (at the City 
Council and at home). 
  8. On 8 October 1993, the attack by 40 members and 
supporters of the SNPU on the office of the state university 
"Lvov Polytechnic" Students' Brotherhood members, who were among 
organizers of the well-known students' hunger strike in 1990 -- 
Andriy Salyuk, Ihor Slipetskyy, and Andrian Klishch.... 
  It is of interest that, during the election campaign, the 
SNPU claimed credit for holding the students' hunger strike and 
the students' movement in general. This gave rise to written 
protests by true participants in the first picketing of the 
Supreme Council building that were not given much publicity in 
the press. 
  During the first round of elections to the Supreme Council, 
Lvov not only abounded in hook-shaped "ideas of the nation," but 
also in long [fascist] occupation-style banners. Credit must be 
given to the party organizers of the election campaign -- from 
the psychological point of view, the propaganda was very 
skillful and used a broad range of measures -- from 
demonstrating unity with Academician Yukhnovskyy to threats of 
physical reprisals against participants in the nonaligned bloc 
"New Wave" [Nova Khvylya] and their supporters. 
  It was precisely the intensity of the psychological 
brainwashing of the population that resulted in an opposite 
reaction. The number of swastikas seems to have gone beyond the 
critical borderline, and Lvov residents became concerned. The 
SNPU candidates, who had been nominated at all electoral 
districts, got negligible numbers of votes, not higher than 5 
percent. However, it does not by any means follow from this 
that Ukrainian fascism has no future. If we make a comparison 
with Russia, then the SNPU is the early stage of "Pamyat" [a 
Russian fascist organization] under the leadership of a somewhat 
forgotten Russian fuehrer Vasilyev: Black uniforms, military 
bearing, anti-Semitism, and a mixture of Christianity and 
paganism. Then, the events in the SNPU must logically develop 
in the direction of its internal split and further evolution -- 
toward legal discussions (this may be exemplified by a quite 
frank article published by Anatoliy Shcherbatyuk [convicted for 
the dissemination of interethnic hostility] in which the author 
calls for the creation of detachments to carry out Ukraine's 
ethnic cleansing) and toward creating an underground similar to 
Barkashov's [leader of Russian fascists]. 
  The unique "Ukrainian" feature of the above phenomenon lies 
in the fact that Nazis throughout the world select Jews, 
immigrants, or ethnic minorities as targets for demonstrating 
their patriotism, whereas the patriotism of the SNPU began to 
manifest itself through beating up Ukrainians. "Bad taste" -- 
this is how Andriy Shkil, one of the leaders of UNA-UNSO 
qualified the beating up of students by the "Nazis" at Hlyboka 
Street. 
  Sleep quietly, Ukrainian citizens! The dissociation of the 
state information area is so great that you will never find out 
about any unpleasant events in an adjacent oblast, provided that 
these events rate as less serious than the Chernobyl catastrophe. 
  The Ukrainian liberators of eastern Ukraine and of the 
Crimea 
from Communists and Muscovites prefer doing so largely in 
Galicia. Despite the fact that in neighboring Volyn, the people 
who opted for socialism led Communists to the second round of 
parliamentary elections and that in neighboring Transcarpathia, 
the word "Ukraine" will soon be associated with abroad. It is 
not without the help of the SNPU that scared stiff the Lvov 
residents that Communist Holub got 8 percent of votes. 
  Sleep and rest assured that the psychiatrists from the SNPU 
can cure you from the chimera called conscience.

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 19, 2-7 May 94] </F>
  [Excerpt] On Thursday, 5 May, President Kravchuk signed a 
decree, which liberalizes Ukraine's export procedures with a 
view of expanding exports of Ukrainian commodities and thus spur 
foreign currency incomings. 
  The decree specifies, in particular, that a list of 
commodities is approved, for which quota and license issuance 
regulations are nullified in 1994, as well as that license 
issuance procedures are no more applicable to commodities, not 
covered by the quota regulations. 
  The decree specifies that exports of coal, ammonia, 
ethylene, 
benzene, methanol, mineral fertilizers and ferrous metals are 
effected following the established procedures without 
specifically authorized subjects of foreign economic activities. 
  The Cabinet of Ministers is instructed to determine, on a 
quarterly basis, amounts of export quotas for the above listed 
commodities to be realized at auctions by the Ministry for 
Foreign Economic Relations. 
  The Cabinet is further instructed to draft, within a month's 
term, and submit to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a law on 
necessary amendments to Cabinet decrees, which regulate exports 
of commodities and services, and to adjust, within a fortnight's 
term, its own resolutions to this decree. 
  The institute of "special exporters" was set up by the 
Cabinet's resolution of 22 December 1993 allegedly with a view 
to make more orderly Ukraine's exports and pursue unified and 
CIS-co-ordinated pricing-export policies, as well as to ensure a 
more regular flow of hard currency to the state budget. 
  The Cabinet resolution approved a list of organisations and 
agencies, which were thus authorized to act as Ukraine's 
exporters of certain commodities. 
  On 5 March and 26 April 1994 the list was substantially 
complemented. 
  According to Valentin Kulichenko, deputy minister for 
industry, these "special exporters" charged from 0.5 to 5 per 
cent of the contract-specified amounts of export proceeds. As 
Mr. Kulichenko maintains, all the "special exporters" 
transferred their currency accounts to the Ukrainian 
Export-Import Bank by the first quarter's close. 
  Meanwhile, as observers believe, the Decree was issued under 
pressure brought to bear by certain commercial (that is, 
nongovernment-owned) structures, which used to deal in metals, 
other raw materials and products before the special exporter 
institute was introduced. 
  So, formally from now on, any juridical person, who 
possesses 
enough means, may buy export quotas at auctions held by the 
Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. However, as experts 
maintain, quota acquisition is not at all tantamount to a 
quota's factual application, since certain structures are 
obviously in a very good position to block the quota application 
process. 
  Besides, according to information furnished by the Industry 
Ministry, last year, none of Ukraine's exporter-manufacturers 
were able to fully realize their quotas. In particular, about 
10 million tons of metals failed to be exported under the issued 
quotas. 
  Thus, as analysts insist, Ukraine's export quota market is 
doomed to remain shared among the very same old and 
long-established influential groups. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Leonid Kapelyushnyy: "Ukrainian Supreme Council </F>
in Addition to 124 Important Issues Will Examine a Paramount, 
125th Issue: Electing a Speaker"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- Before electing a speaker the Ukrainian 
parliamentarians have decided to instruct a provisional working 
presidium of five people to hold the first session. 
  Their candidacies have been discussed in the factions and in 
a certain sense they reflected the parliament's multilevel 
composition. And complex composition. When the five sat down 
at the table the auditorium guffawed loudly -- the central seat 
was taken by Vasil Durdinets, who heads the centrists' faction. 
To the right was Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the socialists and 
a presidential candidate. On the left was Vitaliy Masol, first 
premier of the independent Ukraine, who was "swallowed up" by 
the students' hunger strike. To his left was Petr Simonenko, 
leader of the Ukrainian Communists, who gained 86 seats out of 
350 in the parliament and represent the most powerful faction. 
And next to them was Vyacheslav Chornovil, the eternal 
opposition member and romantic knight of anticommunism. The 
People's Rukh which he heads received about 30 seats and in the 
present situation could seriously influence the adoption of 
important decisions. 
  The word faction is a new one in the Ukrainian dictionary of 
party work. The old Supreme Rada was quite homogenous. At the 
new elections the candidates ran not on party lists but under 
party slogans and now in the first hours of its work the session 
has raised the tough question of identifying allegiances. 
  The more than 100 deputies who are reluctant to join anyone 
and, like Kipling's cat, prefer to "walk by themselves" are of 
some inconvenience to the members of all five factions. Without 
particularly consulting with them they are trying to unite them 
into a mixed group whose status and rights are not completely 
clear to anyone. 
  One of the most curious documents in the first package of 
documents proposed to the deputies is the guideline list of the 
most important issues for examination at the first session. 
There are 124 of them. They include acute, socially painful 
questions of privatization, price formation, the use of nuclear 
energy and radiation energy, the credit and monetary system, and 
others. The rayon to which the village of Shumlyany in Ternopol 
Oblast will belong is probably also a very important question 
for the village's inhabitants but without curbing corruption and 
crime, without checking inflation and creating an effective 
system for all branches of power, Ukraine will simply cease to 
exist as an independent state. 
  The 124 questions include a report by Leonid Kravchuk on the 
political and socioeconomic situation, a Ukrainian Government 
report, the formation of the government, and many other truly 
fateful questions. Like, for instance, the point on additions 
to the law on the demarcation of powers between the organs of 
state power of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea, they contain 
only a hint of their acute nature. Yet the Crimean pickets 
arrived before anyone at the Mariyinskyy Palace and were the 
last to leave. But in contrast to the Sevastopol inhabitants 
with their red flags and portraits of Lenin and Stalin, to whom 
we are accustomed, these stood with yellow and blue banners and 
demanded that the Ukrainian Parliament protect Crimea's 
Ukrainian population from psychological terrorism. The demand 
of a deputation of Crimean public and political organizations 
that the question of the situation in Crimea be included on the 
agenda for the first session was distributed among the deputies 
and journalists. Otherwise, the petition-bearers threaten, they 
are prepared to declare a long-term hunger strike in front of 
the Supreme Council, to appeal to the world public and Ukrainian 
people for support, to urge the people to civil disobedience, 
and to create in Crimea an alternative representative organ of 
Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars, claiming that all responsibility 
"for the further development of events in Crimea will rest with 
the Ukrainian Supreme Council." 
  The deputies' outward lack of haste and boring 
meticulousness on questions of standing orders and procedural 
details are not concealing the tension behind the scenes. One 
of the main issues of the first session is the election of a 
chairman and his deputies. In the opinion of analysts Aleksandr 
Moroz, Vasil Durdinets, and Ivan Plyushch, who is still in the 
shadows, have the greatest chances of becoming speaker. The 
very important question of holding presidential and local 
council elections or, as Leonid Kravchuk insists, of putting 
them off until later, is also so far outside the picture.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- At the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council's afternoon plenary sitting yesterday, it was 
decided that as deputies had not been sufficiently informed 
about their powers they should settle the issue of their labor 
relations with the Supreme Council and resign from any 
previously held office by 1 July. A total of 22 people's 
deputies, representing various political forces, suggested that 
a resolution should be considered with regard to recognizing the 
powers of People's Deputies Volodymyr Hrynyov and Pavlo 
Kudyukin. The draft resolution made provision for "additionally 
verifying the presence of grounds for the elections in their 
constituencies to be deemed invalid, and only then passing a 
decision on the interim credentials commission's submission." 
  This resolution was voted down by a majority, with as few as 
100 of the 338 deputies present having voted for it. 
Representatives of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms [MBR] 
proposed that a special deputies' commission should be formed to 
deal with this issue. That proposal, however, was rejected, too. 
  The sitting also examined the draft resolution "On deputies 
groups (factions) in the Supreme Council of Ukraine." Most 
criticized were the articles on the numerical strength of 
groups, the provision of them with technical means [to organize] 
their work, the institution of groups (factions) on a regional 
or territorial basis, and the possibility for a deputy to work 
in several groups (factions). This resolution is to be adopted 
today after the proposals are generalized. 
  It has already been reported that MBR cochairmen Leonid 
Kuchma and Volodymyr Hrynyov are to hold a news conference at 
1400 today. The venue is the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists 
and Entrepreneurs, 36 Khreshchatyk, Kiev.

  [Text] 
<H5>  Industry </H5>
  The Ukrainian Ministry of Statistics made public its data 
about the national economy's status in the first quarter of 1994. 
  According to the ministry's report, Ukraine's production 
slump accelerated with GNP having dropped by 34 per cent and 
national income by 36 per cent versus the first quarter of 1993. 
  Ukraine's industrial production was particularly hard hit by 
the economic crisis with industrial output having reduced by 38 
per cent and labor productivity by 32 per cent, as compared with 
the same period of 1993. Over three thirds of Ukraine's 
industrial enterprises reduced their output. 
  Ukraine's ferrous metallurgy, chemical, petrochemical, oil 
refining, light, pulp and papermaking industries are listed 
among those hit worst of all by the crisis. 
  Production of basic fuel amounted to 27.3 million tons of 
the 
so-called conditional fuel in 1994's 1st quarter, which was by 
4.3 million tons, or 14 per cent, less than a year ago. Primary 
crude petroleum treatment halved with resultant drastic 
curtailment of automotive gasoline, diesel fuel and oil fuel 
production. 
  Production drops affected the bulk of products, manufactured 
by the chemical and petrochemical industries, such as mineral 
fertilizers, automobile and truck tires, synthetic resins and 
plastics. 
  The timber industry's curtailed production resulted in a 
fivefold reduction in pulp, paper, and cardboard manufacture. 
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  The vernal sowing campaign is underway across Ukraine. As of 
early May, collective and state farms sowed spring crops to 
cover 10 million ha [hectares], which was an increase by 64.5 
per cent versus the same date in 1993. 
  1,145,900 ha were sown with white beet, 592,300 ha with 
sunflower and 73,800 ha with potato seeds. 
  The situation in Ukraine's animal husbandry remained 
complicated, though early and promising stabilization trends 
appeared. Livestock's productivity and fodder supply somewhat 
improved. Thus, averaged per cow milk yield was 424 kg versus 
413 kg in 1993's 1st quarter. However, meat production in 
slaughter weight dropped by almost a third, same as egg 
production (by 21 per cent). 
  Ukraine's livestock and poultry capita reduced by 11 per 
cent. 
<H5>  Construction </H5>
  Ukraine's housing, industrial and societal construction 
decelerated, too. Total dwelling area construction amounted to 
967,000 sq. m., which a reduction by 46 per cent versus 1993's 
1st quarter. 
<H5>  Carriage </H5>
  Industrial and agricultural production curtailment, ruptured 
economic bonds with partner enterprises in "near abroad" 
nations, widespread non-compliance with obligations and chronic, 
acute fuel shortages could not but have a most adverse effect on 
the Ukrainian transport's performance with its aggregate cargo 
haul having dropped from 336 million tons in 1993's 1st quarter 
to 206 million tons this year. Cargo carriage by rail reduced 
by 35 per cent. 
  Trucking reduced by over two times (52 million tons of 
freightage were carried). 
  Marine shipment appeared less affected having hauled a total 
of 6.3 million tons of freightage, which was a meager 8 per cent 
drop versus the year before. 
  A total of 1.1 b. [billion] passengers were carried by rail, 
which was an 18 per cent reduction. 
<H5>  Finances and Prices </H5>
  Disbalanced finances were an important aspect of Ukraine's 
total economic crisis. The state budget's deficit reached 8.6 
trillion krb. [karbovantses]. Monetary emission totalled 10.8 
trillion krb. in the first quarter of 1994, which was 36 times 
the 1993 figure. 
  Happily enough, inflation rates decelerated from month to 
month with January's rate of 119 per cent, February's rate of 
112.6 per cent and March's rate of 105.7 per cent. 
  Overall price growths in the first quarter of 1994 averaged 
1.4 times versus 2.7 times in 1993's 1st quarter. It should be 
noted that averaged food price growths were not as great as 
those for manufactured goods and paid services. The latter 
category's price growths were twofold, as compared with food 
prices. 
  Prices for meat, butter, eggs, citrus fruits even lowered, 
though other fruits and vegetables became even more expensive. 
  Children's wear, footwear, books, newspapers, 
pharmaceuticals 
and office equipment were particularly affected by price hikes. 
  Transportation services topped the list of most 
price-hike-affected paid services, primarily due to 
significantly raised prices for passenger carriage by rail and 
air (by 2.8 times), followed by health resort and recreational 
services and barber and beauty parlor services. 
  As of early January, Ukraine's unemployment rate averaged 
0.29 per cent of the able-bodied adult population. 
  Relief per jobless individual averaged 169,000 krb. in March 
versus 100,000 krb. in January. 
  Ukraine's population was estimated at 52.1 million, as of 1 
April 1994. The number of deaths exceeded that of births by 
75,000 in the first quarter. 
<H5>  Consumer Goods Production </H5>
  Consumer goods production reduced by 39 per cent to total 55 
trillion krb., of which over 45 per cent were contributed by 
enterprises under the State Committee for food industry and the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs, which were followed by 
enterprises under the State Committee for light and textile 
industries (almost 20 per cent of the sum total).

  [Text] On 14 May a conference on issues of settling 
accounts for natural gas was held at the Ukrainian Cabinet of 
Ministers under the chairmanship of Ukraine's Acting Prime 
Minister Yefim Zvyahilskyy. The conference was attended by 
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk and leaders of a 
number of ministries and departments. 
  It was pointed out at the conference that the indebtedness 
of 
enterprises and organizations for gas by 12 May this year 
reached over 14.5 trillion karbovantsi. This is leading to the 
growth of Ukraine's indebtedness to Russia's GazProm [gas 
industry] and is fraught with a stoppage of the natural gas 
deliveries from Russia. 
  The main debtors are the enterprises and organizations 
subordinate to the Ministry of Power Engineering, the Ministry 
of Industry, the Ministry of Machine-Building, the State 
Committee for Housing and Utilities, and the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food. 
  In connection with this, the domestic gas and transport gas 
subunits of DerzhKomNaftoHaz [state oil and gas committee] were 
instructed to stop gas deliveries to the consumers should they 
fail to pay for gas in advance or fail to pay out their debts in 
good time. The cases against persistent defaulters will be 
passed to the court of arbitration. 
  At the same time, the ministries and departments have to pay 
off their debts in compliance with the the worked out schedules 
and take measures to save energy resources.

<F P=106> [Indira Dunayeva report under the "Parliament" rubric: </F>
"State Duma's Debut in a New Place. Lawmaking Activity Resumed 
With New Vigor"] 
  [Text] At the State Duma's new head office (the former 
building of the USSR State Planning Committee) yesterday, a 
number of Duma committees that have had time to move there held 
their meetings. 
  The Legislation and Judicial-Law Reform Committee passed its 
opinion on the draft federal law "On the Basic Guarantees of 
Citizens' Electoral Rights," which was discussed by the 
committee back on 25 April. The opinion says that the draft's 
content is inconsistent with its name -- in particular, 
"regarding the extent to which a number of the draft's 
provisions, for instance, on electoral commissions, are related 
to the guarantees of citizens' electoral rights." Committee 
members think it arguable that the electoral commissions should 
be defined as bodies of state power and the Central Electoral 
Commission as a federal state body. In the committee's view, 
the law gives an unreasonably narrow interpretation of citizens' 
electoral rights, which boil down to the right to elect and to 
get elected, while the nomination of candidates, the conduct of 
electoral campaigns, and so forth have been left outside the 
term. In addition, the draft does not establish an upper age 
limit upon reaching which the citizen may not get elected. When 
assessing the document in general, however, the committee 
proposed that it be submitted to the State Duma for 
consideration, while at the same time setting up for further 
work a joint group made up of deputies, Duma committee staffers, 
and also representatives of the Russian president and the 
Central Electoral Commission. 
  Having considered the draft federal law "On Making 
Amendments 
and Additions to the RSFSR Code on Administrative Law 
Violations," the Legislation Committee made numerous editorial 
amendments to it and recommended that the draft be brought in 
line with the Russian Federation Constitution, after which it 
should be put before the State Duma Council. 
  The Committee on the Affairs of Public Associations and 
Religious Organizations was preoccupied with preparations for 
two roundtables -- 16 May, on the draft law on political 
parties; and 19 May, on the draft law on trade unions. The 
roundtables will be attended by representatives of parties and 
trade union leaders. Yesterday, a commission preparing 
parliamentary hearings on the threat of fascism in Russia held 
its meeting at the same committee. 
  The Committee on Information Policy and Communications 
considered amendments to the Law on Coverage of Government 
Authorities' Activity by State-Owned Mass Media. According to 
Igor Yakovenko, a committee member, the law is currently leading 
in the number of amendments made to it. The committee decided 
to back only those that eliminate excessive regulation of mass 
media activity. In addition, the committee elected its 
representatives -- Igor Yakovenko ("Yabloko") and Valentin 
Chikin (Communist Party of the Russian Federation) -- to sit on 
the commission on state support for the mass media at the 
Russian Press Committee.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich has announced he 
will call for a review of the country's foreign trade policy 
shortly. 
  In an exclusive interview with Interfax, Kebich made it 
clear 
that his cabinet did not like the situation in which "major 
western powers are granting Belarus paltry quotas" for the sale 
of Belarusian goods in the West, especially textiles, which were 
used widely there, and potassium produced in the republic. 
  The premier said that those commodities were of good quality 
and highly competitive on the world market, a fact proven by the 
fact that the quotas for Belarusian cloth and fertilizers for 
sale in the West would be used up as early as May. 
  IF Note: In April this year, a Belarusian governmental 
delegation headed by Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Mechislav 
Hryb visited Strasbourg in France to try to resolve the problem 
in hand at consultations with a deputies from the European 
Parliament. During the talks the Belarusian delegation received 
pledges of tangible assistance in raising quotas for textiles 
and potassium salts. 
  Kebich stressed: "If the West does not allow Belarus on to 
its markets, why, then, should Belarus ignore the fact that 
leading European firms are selling their cars, confectionery, 
radios, beer and spirits, cigarettes and other commodities 
without restriction in Belarus and without quotas being issued 
by ourselves?" The premier was certain that "some products, for 
example those manufactured by the Minsk Kommunarka 
confectioners, are far superior in quality to their western 
counterparts which are currently flooding the Belarussian 
markets." 
  Kebich commented that "the problem with finding sales 
outlets 
exists for practically all CIS states besides Belarus. 
Therefore, it would be a good feasible to resolve these matters 
together." He said he intended to submit the relevant proposal 
to all other CIS prime ministers at their very next summit.

  [Text] During a two-day visit of Kazakh Prime Minister 
Sergey Tereshenko to Iran starting on 14 May, discussions will 
focus on cooperation in reprocessing and transportation of 
Kazakh oil through the Caspian Sea to the northern ports of Iran 
and the possibility of shipping an adequate amount of oil from 
its terminals in the Persian Gulf in return for Kazakh exports. 
This was said to INTERFAX by Kazakh Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vyacheslav Gizatov. 
  According to Gizatov, the discussions will also concern 
"specific plans of funding the construction of a plant for the 
production of machine oils in Atyrau, former Guryev, located on 
the northern coast of the Caspian Sea." 
  Gizatov noted that Iran is interested in imports of Kazakh 
grain, meat, coal and iron ore pellets. Kazakhstan in turn is 
willing to increase imports of consumer goods from Iran. 
  Tereshenko will discuss with the Iranian side the practical 
aspect of supplies to be carried out through the Caspian Sea. 
According to Gizzatov, it is expected that agreements be signed 
on coast trade, creation of a joint trade/commerce chamber, and 
easier procedures for mutual business trips.

  [Text] Tokyo May 15 -- Russia will take part for the first 
time in a political summit of the G-7 countries scheduled in 
Naples on July 8-10. All G-7 members-states, including Japan 
and the United States, which had earlier objected to this, 
agreed to such a modification of the previous formula "seven 
plus one", under which the Russian leader met G-7 leaders after 
the programme of the G-7 summit was comleted, the TOKYO SHIMBUN 
said today with reference to sources from the Japanese 
Government. 
  The political discussion is expected to focus on the 
situation on the Korean peninsula, in connection with suspicions 
that North Korea is involved in the development of nuclear 
weapons, the Bosnian crisis, the progress of peaceful 
settlement in the Middle East, war in Yemen and the situation in 
South Africa following presidential elections. The problem of 
North Korea might be brought up in light of strengthening the 
regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons not only in asia, 
but in the whole world. 
  Russia's problem will be discussed only at an economic 
conference of G-7 leaders. The discussion is expected to focus 
on the expansion of the framework of aid to Russia as it 
switches over to the market economy. 
  Joint measures taken by the G-7 countries in combating 
organised crime in the world are expected to be high on the 
agenda of the economic conference, and in particular, preventing 
the practice of money laundering by drug dealers and drug 
trafficking. 
  The TOKYO SHIMBUN newspaper pointed out that Russia's 
participation would make some corrections in final documents of 
the Naples summit. "In respect of the stance taken by Japan and 
the United States" G-7 member-states decided not to adopt a 
traditional political declaration, but outline the course of the 
discussion in a brief statement made by Italy which would chair 
the summit.

Pribytkov] 
  [Text] Geneva, 14 May -- Russia is actively involved in 
preparing the final document of the summit of the seven leading 
countries in the West and the Russian Federation, which will be 
held in Naples in July. 
  Andrey Kozyrev told journalists in Geneva today that the 
first consultations of representatives of foreign policy 
departments was recently held in Italy. Deputy Foreign Minister 
Sergey Lavrov took part in them on the Russian side. "The 
sessions were positive, we have already put forward our 
proposals regarding the text of the document, and other 
countries have also presented their proposals," the head of 
Russian diplomats said. "Thus, practical work is under way to 
draw up the final document of the `G-8' regarding issues of the 
world's security policy. I think we are on the right track 
here." 
  Commenting on the process for linking Russia to the new 
export control system intended to replace Cocom [Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls], the minister 
observed that in that respect the dialogue had not yet reached 
the necessary level. Russian experts "are not as yet directly 
involved in the work, although we do have assurances from the 
American side." "Additional complications have arisen" in this 
regard. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov 
recently met his counterparts from the United States. The same 
question was discussed today during a conversation with Warren 
Christopher. "It was confirmed once more that the next meeting 
of experts to draft the new COCOM regime will take place with 
the direct participation of Russia," Andrey Kozyrev pointed out. 
"I said quite unequivocally: We shall be simply unable to join 
in a regime that has been drafted without our equal 
participation."

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Baltic Sea Fleet Press Center in </F>
Kaliningrad; date not given] 
  [Text] On 29 March 1994, the Latvian newspaper DIENA -- 
referring to an interview in the Estonian daily HOMMIKULEHT with 
Juri Pihl, director general of Estonia's security police -- 
published an article entitled "Russian Officers Are Accused of 
Trading in Radioactive Substances." 
  The publication includes a number of statements which need 
to 
be clarified as follows. 
  First: In February 1993, the command of the Tallinn Naval 
Base, with the permission of higher authorities, concluded an 
agreement with the Estonian "Bankers" firm on the disposal of 
scrap metal from two decommissioned hovercraft minesweepers. 
The decommissioning was carried out over two months at a dock 
in Kopli harbor. Provisions of the agreement, including those 
concerning payment, were fulfilled by both sides. According to 
a representative of the user of these ships, there were no 
radioactive substances in the units or systems of the 
minesweepers. That is to say, information contained in the 
above-mentioned article concerning "components with radiation 
levels of 200 Roentgen per hour" does not correspond to the 
facts. The command of the Tallinn Naval Base has not received 
any complaints from any side with regard to this. 
  Second: A statement by the paper concerning a collection 
point for scrap metal, which was allegedly opened on the Naval 
Base under the authorization of the Tallinn garrison chief, does 
not correspond to the facts, as well. 
  Third: The publication points out that "the background 
radiation in the Mine Harbor exceeds natural radiation levels by 
40 times." Obviously, this statement has its origin in the 
following real fact. 
  In March 1994, workers on two decommissioned minesweepers in 
the Mine Harbor of the Tallinn port unscreened remote-controlled 
pickup units with one radioactive "Cesium-137" unit in each. 
This caused a brief period of excess natural background 
radiation. On 22 March, the screens of the pickup units were 
reestablished; on 30 March, they were dismantled and stored in a 
special depository at the Paldiski garrison. The ensuing 
measurements, which were taken in the Mine Harbor by naval 
specialists along with representatives of the Estonian side, did 
not detect any excess levels of natural background radiation. 
  The distortion of real facts and the dissemination of 
corresponding "sensations," which take place in various Latvian 
and Estonian media, do not assist in the normal, planned process 
of withdrawing Russian troops and naval forces from the 
territory of these republics.

<F P=106> ["Shakhray Dismissed To Normalize Russo-Chechen Ties" -- </F>
ITAR-TASS headline; by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] 
  [Text] Moscow May 16 TASS -- Sergey Shakhray has "yielded" 
his office of minister for nationalities and regional policies 
to head of the Krasnodar territory administration, economist 
Nikolay Yegorov, 42. 
  Shakhray indirectly confirmed the information on May 13, 
when 
he signed a Russo-Crimean treaty in his capacity of a Russian 
vice- premier and then explained that it was his sole post now. 
  According to a well-informed source inside the Russian 
Government, who shared the above information with ITAR-TASS, 
"the presidential decree on appointing the new nationalities 
minister was not signed as yet, therefore, press reports on 
forthcoming cabinet reshuffle were a leak of reliable 
information." 
  As a vice-premier, Shakhray will continue to supervise 
various issues of nationalities and regional policies. 
  His dismissal may be associated with a stand taken by the 
Chechen leaders, who did not want Shakhray to represent Russia 
at bilateral talks. 
  President Dzhokhar Dudayev of Chechnya possibly bears a 
grudge against Shakhray because the latter repeatedly emphasized 
that Russo-Chechen talks could begin on the condition that 
pre-term elections be held in Chechnya first. 
  Hopefully, the new nationalities minister Yegorov will 
manage 
to find a more flexible approach to reaching a bilateral 
agreement with Chechnya.

  [Text] Ufa May 14 TASS -- "I have not seen a presidential 
decree on my dismissal, so I cannot comment on reports about my

  [Text] Moscow, 12 May (TURAN)--The meeting between 
President Aliyev and Armenia's President Ter-Petrosyan is due to 
take place in Moscow in the up-coming days, reports sources from 
the Russian Foreign Ministry. Russia is acting as initiator and 
organizer of the Armenian-Azerbaijani summit. 
  "The presidents of both republics are expected to sign an 
agreement providing for a ceasefire, withdrawal of troops from 
captured territories, and a restoration of communications," 
reported the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry reports that the leadership of 
Nagorno-Karabakh will sign the agreement as well. 
  The agreement is to be based on the agreement signed in 
February 1994 by Azerbaijan's and Armenia's Defense Ministers 
as well as representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  The key point of the agreement is the introduction of 
peacemaking separating forces in the zone of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. 
  "In line with the agreement, Moscow will be the guarantor of 
the Armenian-Azerbaijani truce. The peacemaking forces can be 
referred to as international element to the CIS peacemaking 
forces, but they will be headed by Russian armed forces," told a 
highranking diplomatic source to Moscow's TURAN's correspondent.

  [Text] Kiev May 13 TASS -- The process of dismantling and 
pullout of nuclear warheads from Ukraine into Russia is under 
full control and goes ahead as scheduled. A total of 180 
warheads had been removed from Ukraine to the Russian Federation 
by now, said Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in an interview 
with ITAR-TASS at an opening ceremony of the Kiev spring fair on 
Friday. 
  "It is no secret for anyone that combat nuclear missiles 
stationed on the Ukrainian territory were not under Ukraine's 
control since the 'nuclear button' was in Moscow. Besides, 
Ukraine never sought to take possession of such dangerous 
weapons," the Ukrainian president said. He confirmed Ukraine's 
intention to implement in full a tripartite agreement signed by 
the Russian, Ukrainian and the U.S. presidents at the beginning 
of 1994. 
  "We signed the agreement, hoping that other nuclear 
countries 
would take adequate measures and begin disarmament," Kravchuk 
said. He pointed out that according to information at his 
disposal the United States intends to make large-scale cuts of 
their nuclear arsenals, fulfilling agreements reached during the 
Moscow meeting. 
  He went on to say that by the end of May all American 
missiles targeted at Ukraine would be re-coded. "The time comes 
when our countries will really switch over from words of 
friendship and cooperation to concrete deeds," he said.

  [Text] Kiev -- Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk took 
part in a phone-in today for readers of the MOLOD UKRAYINY youth 
newspaper. Answering a question from a UNIAN correspondent on 
whether the decision to run in the presidential election on 26 
June is final, Leonid Kravchuk said: "I would like the Supreme 
Council to consider my appeal. If it postpones the election, I 
will withdraw my candidature; if the decision by the previous 
parliament remains in force, I will run in the presidential 
election." 
  "If the election, nonetheless, does take place, who of the 
other contenders for the post of president would you regard as a 
possible rival?", asked the UNIAN correspondent. Leonid 
Kravchuk replied: "It is difficult to say this. The main 
contenders, who have made a good showing and who have the 
appropriate image are Ivan Plyushch and Leonid Kuchma. I know 
that certain circles like young contenders Valeriy Babych and 
Volodymyr Lanovyy. Oleksandr Moroz and Petro Talanchuk are also 
taking an active part in the election. That is to say, I would 
not like to distinguish anyone -- everyone has his chance and 
time will show who takes advantage of it."

  [Text] At a meeting between the defense ministers of 
Armenia and Azerbaijan and the commander of the Karabakh Army 
today, an agreement was signed envisaging a reliable ceasefire 
in Karabakh. 
  [Correspondent Murtazin] To judge by all events, for the 
first time in the six years of the Karabakh conflict, today the 
warring sides have reached a final accord on a ceasefire. This 
is to take place at midnight on 16-17 May. Pavel Grachev has 
taken the process of disengaging the troops into his own hands. 
Journalists were invited to the meeting, which probably 
witnesses to the fact that all fundamental issues had already 
been settled. 
  The main thing is a total ceasefire along the entire 
frontline. According to the Russian minister's plan, by 25 May 
the warring sides should be withdrawn to a distance of between 5 
and 15 kms from the contact lines. The security zones thus 
created will be occupied by Russia's peacekeeping forces under 
the command of First Deputy Defense Minister Georgiy Kondratyev. 
  Issues relating to the withdrawal of troops from the 
territory of Azerbaijan will be resolved not by the military, 
but by politicians: it is they who will determine the staus of 
Nagorno-Karabakh.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 May -- The leaders of the defense 
departments of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh should 
issue an order today to cease-fire starting midnight 16-17 May. 
An accord on this was reached in Moscow today during the talks 
between the defense departments of the three sides, with the 
mediation of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. 
  Questions of the first stage of settling the 
Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict with a cease-fire and separating 
the sides within the framework of the protocol that was signed 
on 18 February this year were discussed. 
  Under the accords that will be signed by the leaders of the 
military departments tomorrow, the lines of contact from which 
the troops will be withdrawn beginning 25 May -- to a distance 
of five to 10 kilometers, depending on the local conditions -- 
will be set. It is intended to create and set up by 24 May 49 
observation posts along the demarcation line. Russian officers 
will command the posts, but their companies will comprise 
representatives of the sides, possibly of the CIS states, and 
the CSCE. It is proposed that special peacekeeping forces of 
Russia or the CIS states numbering around 1,800 should be set up 
to guarantee the safety of the posts. 
  Moreover, a reserve of forces and weapons on the scale of 
one 
motorized rifle battalion will be set up. 
  It has been provisionally agreed that the peacekeeping will 
be funded equally by Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  The parties agreed that the protocol on today's meeting 
would 
stipulate the commencement of the second stage -- elimination of 
the consequences of the conflict, withdrawal from Azerbaijani 
territory, and return of refugees -- immediately after the first 
stage. The question of Nagorno-Karabakh's status will then be 
decided at a political level. 
  General supervision of the peacekeeping has been entrusted 
to 
Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy minister of 
defense. Plans for this peacekeeping operation are to be drawn 
up by 19 May for approval by the Russian president and agreement 
with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  For the first time, the talks were held with the press 
present. The military delegations of the participants in the 
talks were headed by Azerbaijani Defense Minister Mammadrafi 
Mammadov, Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan, and Samvel 
Babayan, the commander of the Nagorno-Karabakh self-defense 
army. The Armenian and Azerbaijani ambassadors and Russian 
Ambassador-at-Large Vladimir Kazimirov also took part.

  [Text] The talks in Moscow on the Karabakh settlement have 
ended in failure. The signing of that protocol was actually 
thwarted by the Armenian side, which demanded that the status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh be defined and that, in parallel, troops from 
the seized Azerbaijani territories be withdrawn. 
  Unfortunately, the Armenian mission in Moscow also confirmed 
that the talks have ended in nothing. It blamed everything on 
the Azerbaijani delegation, which allegedly refused to sign the 
document.

  [Text] Tokyo May 17 TASS -- Interviewed here by ITAR-TASS, 
Uzbek President Islam Karimov, currently visiting Japan, today 
called for genuine economic integration of the republics of the 
former USSR. He expressed the view that the "Commonwealth of 
Independent States was used by some politicians as a screen 
behind which they could carry on their affairs". 
  "I stand for the quickest possible economic integration of 
the republics of the former USSR, lack of which brings 
sufferings to all of them -- Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan and all the rest," Karimov noted. He stressed that 
Uzbekistan backed the idea of setting up an economic union 
within the frameworks of the CIS. "This is why," the president 
said, "Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan concluded an 
agreement at the end of April on a single economic space 
covering the three. Karimov pointed out that the tripartite 
economic union was open for Russia and all the other republics 
of the former USSR. Russian President Boris Yeltsin was 
informed about this. 
  "We presume that the single economic space, created by the 
three republics, is a prototype of the economic union that must 
be set up within the frameworks of the entire Commonwealth of 
Independent States," the president said. He denied as 
groundless all the press reports claiming that the Central Asian 
republics were shutting themselves off from the other republics. 
  Karimov expressed great doubts about the feasibility of the 
idea of setting up a Euro-Asian union on the basis of the CIS 
republics. He urged to "fully implement the CIS idea through 
economic integration".

  [Text] TALLINN, May 16, BNS -- A social affairs and 
related areas ministers-level meeting of Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania in Tallinn today signed a memorandum on social 
security and protection. 
  The document, prepared at a meeting in the Lohusalu seaside 
resort near Tallinn last weekend, deals with the developing of 
the social security and social protection systems, health care 
and labor market organization. 
  The problems of the three countries in this field are very 
much the same and are mainly connected with shortage of funds, 
Estonian Social Affairs Minister Marju Lauristin said. All 
three countries are aiming toward creation of a social security 
framework that would be suitable for a poor country and cover 
the entire population, she added. 
  Also the health care structures of Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania are facing common problems in their transition to a 
so-called family doctors' general practitioner system to form 
the basic level in their health care structures. 
  The third most topical issue is coordination of decisions 
concerning the labor market and protection of the labor market, 
the minister told reporters. 
  While introducing changes in these three areas the Baltics 
are keeping in view their possible joining with the European 
Union and are proceeding from the standards now valid in Europe. 
  The meeting also set up five different commissions -- on 
social security issues, on social protection, on issues of the 
work force market, on employment, and on health care. The three 
countries are to draw up a common social development project to 
be presented to European and worldwide forums. 
  This was also the first time for the social and related 
affairs ministers from the three Baltic countries to meet at a 
common table.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 17 -- The Russian national newspapers 
comment of the blast that destroyed a considerable amount of 
ammunition of the Russian Pacific Fleet. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
quotes Maritime Territory Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko as 
saying that the accident was a result of the "thoughtless 
practice" of reducing the army and the navy and insufficient 
funding, which have led to the weakening of discipline in units 
and formations. 
  TRUD suggests that "as always we will now calculate the 
damage which could have been avoided, and continue to hope for 
the better. There will probably be no next blast. But who can 
guarantee that more people will not have to flee their burning 
houses and bury their loved ones hit by unsparing shell 
fragments?". 
  The newspapers also comment on the explosion in Tbilisi's 
Armenian theatre. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports that "the 
Georgian leader made a statement saying the act of terror was 
aimed not at the Armenians residing in Georgia but personally at 
the head of state and his policy". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA daily says the investigator in charge 
has no doubt that "it was just another routine act of 
diversion". An unofficial version is that the accident is an 
echo of the Karabakh war. Acts of subversion on Georgian 
territory against Armenians and Azeris are a permanent headache 
for Georgian security forces." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carried an interview with the secretary 
of the council of defence ministers of the Commonwealth 
member-countries Leonid Ivashov. Asked whether the Baltic 
countries have shown any interest in interacting with the CIS 
member countries in the military field replied, "no active steps 
have yet been taken but I am sure that this process is bound to 
begin earlier or later. The past two years have convincingly 
shown that playing up to the public in politics is one thing and 
real life is something else. We, former Soviet republics, are 
necessary to ourselves and to other ex-Soviet republics. The 
rest of the world has a different interest in us. The 
politicians should start thinking about the future of their 
children and grandchildren. It does not take a lot of brains to 
destroy things...". 
  The same newspaper comments on last week's Geneva talks on 
Bosnia: "What happened at the Geneva meeting of the foreign 
ministers of Russia, the United States, France, Britain, 
Germany. Belgium and Greece, as well as of representatives of 
the United Nations and the European Union, was evaluated by all 
the participants as the world community's breakthrough in the 
Bosnian direction. For the first time the parties immediately 
involved in the settlement of the crisis reached a uniform 
understanding of the problem and took a common stand". 
  ROSSIYSKIE VESTI publishes a viewpoint of Russian 
parliamentarians on the current elections in Ukraine, as 
formulated by Yevgeniy Krinitskiy, an expert of the State Duma 
Committee for Commonwealth affairs and relations with 
compatriots. According to him, "our observers have no doubt 
that the public opinion vector in Ukraine is clearly shifting 
towards pro-Russian sentiments. This is not a theoretical 
assumption, as the fact has been confirmed by a republic wide 
poll. Russia's position should be oriented toward strengthening 
ties with Ukraine without any infringement of its national and 
state dignity, on the basis of mutual respect and mutual 
benefit". 
  The same newspaper carries and interview with Bulgarian 
Ambassador to Russia Kristo Miladinov who points out that "the 
disruption of links is painful and affects the wellbeing of both 
countries. The attempts of our (Bulgarian) entrepreneurs to 
find a niche in the West has led nowhere. Even given an 
agreement with the European Union we cannot force our way onto 
the European: We cannot compete in either prices or quality of 
our products or in stability of deliveries, i believe -- and 
many people agree with this -- that the Commonwealth and Russia 
first of all must remain our main trade partners". 
  NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA (New Daily) reports that "the 
chairman of the Russian State Committee on Defence Industries 
has announced that Russia pans to increase its arms exports by 
50 per cent this year. Given that the Russian gas and oil 
industry is experiencing hard times, arms exports can become one 
of the main sources of Russia's hard currency earnings. 
Russia's main clients in this field are China and India who buy 
between them one half of all the arms Russia sells abroad. in 
addition, the country is planning to make its way onto new 
markets, among which the Middle and Near East is the most 
promising". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reports that "according to the Georgian 
health minister, Avtandil Dzhorpenadze, 17 thousand of the 
republic's inhabitants have been infected with rabies and are in 
need of urgent medical treatment. Several deaths have already 
been registered. The minister thinks an epidemic is likely to 
flare up in summer unless emergency measures are taken to 
enforce sanitary order. A special commission of the Health 
Ministry has reported that the situation is the worst in 
Adzharia.

<F P=106> [Yuliy Semenenko "Pertinent Remarks": "Who Is My Militia </F>
Protecting?"] 
  [Text] Krasnodar Kray -- The people of the Kuban will 
recall seeing in early March an abundance of people in militia 
uniform, and also civilians, who had been drilled to precision. 
They filled the streets, squares, and highways of the kray 
center and environs. "Some VIP's have come, evidently," the 
shrewdest onlookers decided, glancing around apprehensively. 
  The ordinary people of Kransodar were clairvoyant. In fact, 
Internal Affairs Minister V.F. Yerin had flown into the kray to 
attend a session of the kray administration collegium to discuss 
the crime situation, which has become critical. Our big chiefs 
are automatically kept away from the people, given the kid glove 
treatment. Because the people are a multitudinous mass, there 
is no need to be particularly protective toward them. If 
someone is killed or goes missing he will immmediately be 
replaced by several law-abiding or not very law-abiding 
citizens. At least, that was the case before the reforms, when 
Russia's women, without shirking and without delving into 
politics, would unfailingly keep the population topped up. 
  Now they are clearly falling down on the job. Are they on 
strike, perhaps, or are they too politicized? The more we 
democratize, in fact, the more noticeably thin our ranks become. 
Well, what of it? Some people would say there are too many 
people in the country anyway. So they fire pistols, 
submachineguns, and tank guns at the people and at their elected 
representatives. They have crack units on the ready, so that 
the people know their place. While their leaders, not fearing 
and not made to feel awkward by the "common folk," confidently 
drove wherever they needed to go -- toward the yawning heights 
of capitalism. 
  So it is probably no accident that Viktor Fedorovich paid 
such keen attention to the actions of "Cobra" -- a crack subunit 
of the special purpose militia detachment -- during his visit to 
the kray. And there was certainly something to see. These 
Russian equivalents of the U.S. supermen were expertly 
restraining and blocking the "mob" and stopping the 
"toublemakers" operating. 
  On this occasion the special militia was showing off its 
combat training in a demonstration exercise. The guys acted in 
the proper manner -- swiftly, vigorously, resolutely, without a 
moment's hesitation. So they would not let anyone down in 
future incidents. The minister liked the militia subunits' 
combat equipment, although the fact that the kray does not have 
a mounted militia is in his view a major deficiency. 
  Anyway, while the bosses were inspecting their subordinates 
and having their meeting, life went on as usual in the Kuban. 
The criminals, who, despite the constant swelling of the law 
enforcement ranks, still outnumber the militia and who were 
ignorant of Mr. Yerin's visit, carried on their business as 
usual -- robbing, killing, raping, thieving, stealing cars. Yet 
another remarkable fact now from the life of your 
coprrespondent. At the very moment when Yerin arrived in our 
crime-infested kray, the head of a Krasnodar organization which 
leases rooms to various offices, including the firm for which 
the aforesaid journalist's wife works, was visited by two 
racketeers with a business proposal -- without causing a fuss 
and without needlessly bothering the militia (we have our people 
working in the militia, they said) he must come up with 6 
million by such and such a day, or else... 
  The boss was somewhat flabbergasted and tried to show that, 
in the first place, he did not have that kind of money, because 
he lived on his modest pay, and second, he was already paying a 
regular amount through the proper channels, and he gave the name 
of a specific representative of the "Kuban business world." No 
dice! The uninvited guests were insistent. Where it will all 
end no one knows.... 
  To round off, I would like to borrow the words of the poet, 
paraphrase them somewhat, and ask the question: "Who is my 
militia protecting?"

<F P=106> [Svetlana Shipunova report: "Kuban Without Power"] </F>
  [Text] Krasnodar -- The Kuban is one of the few regions in 
Russia where the new representative power has still not been 
elected. The election date has been set three times and has 
been postponed three times -- the last time until 20 November 
1994. The majority of the kray's political forces have come out 
sharply against this, including the "Otechestvo" patriotic 
movement with the biggest mass appeal here, the All-Kuban 
Cossack Host, and the kray organization of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia. Moreover, "Otechestvo's" 
Coordinating Council has even brought a court action against 
Kray Administration Head N. Yegorov for violating citizens' 
constitutional electoral rights. 
  This situation has now been exacerbated by a new 
development. 
It was learned right after the May holidays that Nikolay Yegorov 
had been appointed a Russian Federation minister (it has not yet 
been divulged what his functions will be in the government). 
According to unofficial data, V. Gladskoy, first deputy head of 
the kray administration, has categorically refused to take up 
this post and is still merely acting governor. 
  Thus, the Kuban is at present without both legislative power 
and executive power in the person of a legitimate administration 
head. Yu. Skokov, previously the leader of a major Krasnodar 
Kray enterprise; V. Samoylenko, the present mayor of the city of 
Krasnodar; and some others are being named here among the 
possible candidates for this post. 
  It is not, however, a question of which of them the 
president 
will choose and whom he will appoint in his edict, already for 
the third time, to rule the Kuban. Public opinion is 
unequivocally inclined to hold an election of the administration 
head. The Kuban deputies in the State Duma have sent a letter 
to B. Yeltsin and V. Chernomyrdin demanding the holding of 
simultaneous elections of the kray administration head, the kray 
legislative assembly, and the organs of local self-management no 
later than September (in other words right after the end of the 
cereal grain harvest). Today the same demand is being advanced 
by the Cossacks and a number of the kray's political and public 
organizations. As for the population, it advocated elections in 
a referendum as long ago as 25 April last year. 
  If the country's leaders do not heed public opinion this 
time 
either, the political situation in the kray might be sharply 
exacerbated by the beginning of summer.

  [Text] The Russian Constitution is being contravened in 
Mordovia. That is the finding of a special commission formed by 
the Russian president, which investigated whether laws and legal 
enactments adopted in the republic conform to the Constitution. 
According to our Saransk correspondent, Nikolay Vechkayev, the 
commission found among other things that the Mordovian 
parliament's decision to abolish the republican constitutional 
court was a breach of the constitution. It also ruled that the 
Mordovian Government had no right to carry out the [Mordovian] 
Supreme Soviet's decision to provide the heads of urban and 
district administrations with powers to call local elections on 
their own initiative. This is the responsibility of the 
republic's supreme body of power.

<F P=106> [Natalya Ostrovskaya report: "Catching Illegals from Abroad </F>
in Maritime Kray"] 
  [Text] Vladivostok -- In just two days of the operation 
code-named "Foreigner" in Maritime Kray, more than 200 violators 
of passport and visa regulations have been apprehended from 
China, Korea, Mongolia, and nearby foreign countries -- the 
former Union republics. 
  Some 48 of them (mainly Chinese) had absolutely no reason to 
be in our country. Consequently, they were swiftly put on buses 
and sent to the Maritime Kray settlement of Pogranichnyy. From 
there the indisciplined foreigners were expelled by rail, in a 
reserved car. The Maritime Kray militia reported that the 
expulsion went quietly and professionally. 
  Operation "Foreigner" will continue until 20 May. Apart from 
Vladivostok, the hunt for violators of passport and visa 
regulations will be carried out in Ussuriysk, Nakhodka, and in 
border settlements through which tourists, Chinese "traders" 
[chelnochniki], and other foreign guests enter the kray and, 
from there, other parts of the country. 
  Violators of passport regulations are not always quietly 
expelled. In the first two days of the operation six criminal 
cases have been brought against foreigners. The charge for all 
of them is the same -- [Article] No. 196 (forgery, and the sale 
and use of deliberately forged documents). As a rule, the 
document in question will be a Soviet passport. Just how simply 
and openly these forgeries are carried out is shown by the case 
of a certain Choe Ko-un, a DPRK citizen. 
  He traveled to Vladivostok and rented an apartment in the 
city center, but under the name of Andrey Vyacheslavovich 
Khodykin rather than Choe Ko-un. He explained at the 
investigation that he had acquired our hammer-and-sickle 
passport in Ussuriysk from some strangers, paying 200,000 rubles 
for it. It seems that it is not just the Russian ruble that is 
being devalued.... What prospect does Choe Ko-un face? If he 
is lucky, a year's imprisonment; if not, two years. 
  Operation "Foreigner" is extensively under way on several 
fronts. Hotels, hostels, and private apartments rented by 
foreign guests are being raided. Conferences are being held 
with the leaders of local tour firms. These people often fail 
to monitor the tourists' return home. 
  As a result, more than 4,000 Chinese have entered Maritime 
Kray as tourists since the start of the year, but only slightly 
over 1,000 have returned. So the figures quoted at the start of 
this article for the number of foreigners detained in the course 
of the operation are truly just a drop in the bucket. 
  Judging by the results of a raid on a famous Chinese flea 
market in Vladivostok, it is time to open a permanent 
specialized militia detachment there. Thus, in just one raid, 
forces from the Special Purpose Militia Detachment and several 
rayon internal affairs departments arrested 80 Chinese without 
the necessary documents. The task of permanent militia 
monitoring is made easier by the conditions in the local trading 
system -- the flea market is surrounded by a strong barbed-wire 
cordon, and the territory allocated to it is minimal. 
  Nobody today knows what the correlation between the local, 
Maritime Kray population and the foreigners is. No estimate at 
all can be made of the number of the latter, because of the lack 
of registration and records for people crossing the border. The 
range of opinions about their arrival is just as great as the 
difference between the actual and the officially registered 
"foreign presence" in Maritime Kray. 
  All we know is that, in comparison with last year, "foreign" 
crime in the kray has grown threefold. There are 7,000 
foreigners officially registered -- and, therefore, living 
legally -- in Vladivostok alone. The overwhelming majority of 
them are Chinese. They work at 200 enterprises in the kray 
center and observe the passport and visa formalities. By all 
accounts, they will not be affected by Operation "Foreigner."

<F P=106> [Correspondent Aleksandr Chernykh report: "Poor Little Rich </F>
Man -- the Nuclear Version"] 
  [Text] Tomsk -- This winter rumors spread around Tomsk 
that the Siberian chemical combine in Seversk (Tomsk-7) could be 
shut down. In particular, that coal reserves had reached a 
critical level because of the financial crisis. 
  At a press conference combine director G. Khandorin did not 
rule out the possibility that the enterprise could be shut down. 
Although he naturally expressed the hope that the government 
would not allow this. Otherwise a social explosion would 
follow, because one-fifth of the city's inhabitants are directly 
employed at the combine. Counting their families, the number 
increases about threefold. The main thing is that over one-half 
of the local budget comes from payments and taxes received from 
the combine. 
  The combine's specialists believe that even a brief closure 
will have unpredictable consequences, and economic computations 
show that ensuring the safety of a closed combine is in no way 
cheaper than the cost of operating it. 
  All these arguments were set out in a letter addressed to 
Head of Government V.S. Chernomyrdin. It was signed by atomic 
energy first deputy minister Konovalov and oblast administration 
head Kress. Tomsk inhabitants are requesting financial support. 
Not the one-shot kind but support in the form of regular 
credits, and even at the usual rather than a preferential 
interest rate. 
  Someone might protest here: Russia's entire economy is in 
crisis and the budget deficit is enormous, yet nuclear power 
workers are asking for credit, and regular creditat that. But 
the whole paradox is that the Siberian chemical combine is a 
profitable enterprise. A fact, strange as it may seem. Even 
though in the first quarter the combine received 22 billion 
rubles [R] less than it should have. The "Tomskenergo" 
joint-stock company failed to pay a debt of around R8 billion. 
In turn the combine owed R17.4 billion for fuel for the AES 
[nuclear electric power station) and for coal for the TETS 
[thermal power station]. 
  Yet the nuclear power workers say confidently that they will 
settle up with everybody at the end of the year. The letter to 
the government says unequivocally that all credits will be 
repaid with guaranteed interest. A profit of R150 billion is 
even planned by the end of the year. This can be explained very 
simply: The Siberian chemical combine has reliable partners in 
distant foreign countries. 
  "The point is that Western partners pay only in two 
instalments," Yu. Samarin, the combine's deputy economics 
director, explains. "Once immediately prior to the moment when 
a contract starts to be implemented, and the second time when 
the final settlement is made. So it turns out that we have a 
positive balance for only three to four months a year. But on 
the whole we are in credit for the year. Even though money to 
acquire fuel and materials is needed every month." 
  The Siberian chemical combine finds itself in the role of a 
poor little rich man. This will continue until the nonpayments 
crisis is eradicated and until a mutual settlement system which 
operates efficiently has been established. But until these 
times of plenty arrive the nuclear power workers need regular 
credits. Chernomyrdin responded to the letter positively. It 
has been passed to the relevant authorities with an appropriate 
resolution. There could still be slip-ups at this stage of 
agreements and settlements. The Finance Ministry is quite 
capable of making a negative finding. There is no spare money 
in the budget. Yet this is a special case. Both nuclear safety 
and the interests of an oblast of a million people must be borne 
in mind. The main thing is that it is not just another 
bottomless pit where credits disappear, never to return. As the 
saying goes, the product is guaranteed.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Vakhrin report: "Will There Nonetheless Be a </F>
Referendum?"] 
  [Text] Kostroma -- Kostroma's "Greens" are stepping up 
their onslaught on the local administration. They have held a 
rally demanding that a precise date be set for a referendum on 
the future of construction work on the Kostroma AES [nuclear 
electric power station]. 
  A year ago local opponents of the construction near the city 
of Buy collected the number of signatures needed to demand a 
referendum in the oblast. But the leaders of the government 
ignored it and they are today pretending that "nothing of the 
kind is happening." That is understandable since the local 
authorities are pininng their hopes of major financial 
injections in the oblast's economy on the construction work. At 
any rate that is what the Ministry of Atomic Energy has 
promised. But the oblast environmental movement "Life" has no 
intention of backing down, and Oblast Governor Valeriy Arbuzov 
will evidently have to go to court in the near future as 
defendant in a case brought by the "Greens," who are charging 
him with opposing the holding of a referendum.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report from </F>
Chelyabinsk-65 by Sergey Sergeyev and Viktor Sosunov, identified 
by caption] 
  [Text] A train carrying spent nuclear fuel from the 
Finnish nuclear power station in Lovisa originally built with 
Soviet assistance arrived in the notorious city of 
Chelyabinsk-65 at the beginning of May. This happened despite 
the efforts to stop the train by activists of the international 
Greenpeace organization. The local Greens are also vigorously 
protesting against the importation of foreign nuclear waste to 
the southern Urals. Activists of the Movement for Nuclear 
Safety have mounted a picket at the oblast administration 
headquarters and are collecting signatures to prevent 
Chelyabinsk Oblast from being turned into a world nuclear waste 
ground. 
  Meanwhile the train carrying spent nuclear fuel from Finland 
has been unloaded and the said material is now in one of the 
Mayak Chemical Combine's plants. Uranium will be extracted from 
this material and returned to the nuclear power industry; the 
Ministry of Atomic Energy will receive a substantial sum of 
money in dollars; and by all accounts the waste will remain, as 
ever, in Chelyabinsk Oblast, whose territory has long since been 
declared an ecological disaster zone.

ITAR-TASS reports under the "Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow" rubric: 
"Rains Help"] 
  [Text] Grain farmers in Altay Kray have sown the first 1 
million hectares of grain. The rains in Altay Kray proved 
highly opportune: The ground became saturated with moisture, 
which has been lacking since the winter. 
  Sugar beet farmers have also brought sowing equipment into 
the fields. Around another 2,000 hectares have already been 
sown to this crop. Over one-half the allocated area has been 
sown to sunflowers. Specialists estimate that the current pace 
of the sowing campaign in Altay Kray is no worse than last year.

  [Text] Minsk, 16 May -- Fulfilling the decision of the Holy 
Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Belarusian clergy will 
not take part in the Republic's first presidential election. 
  A BELINFORM correspondent was informed at the office of the 
diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church that there is no 
substance in reports that the clergy are canvassing for one 
candidate or another or participating in groups. At the same 
time some church ministers have until now been actively engaging 
in politics; deputies at various levels are permitted to 
complete their term in office as set out by the law.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 13/5/1994 -- The 
professionalization of the Army will be one of the main tasks of 
the Defence Ministry in the near future, states to the newspaper 
PACEA CIVICA (CIVIC PEACE) Pavel Creanga, Moldovan defense 
minister. By late 1995, professionals will represent the 
largest portion of military specialists in the Army units and 
subdivisions. Later the whole Army, from soldiers to generals, 
will become professional. Creanga rejects certain people's 
proposals to liquidate the Army. He says that Moldova should 
have "sufficiently numerous regular troops mobile and capable of 
confronting eventual threats to its security." Referring to the 
instruction of officers, Creanga specified that by late 1995 at 
"Alexandru cel Bun" Military College courses for retraining 
different military specialists will begin. He also said that 
other special schools for instructing professional soldiers will 
be opened as well. About 100 graduates from the CIS military 
schools will begin serving this year in the Defense Ministry. 
Many Moldovan Army soldiers are studying in France, Romania, 
the U.S.A., and Greece, Says Creanga.

  [Text] Deputy speaker of Moldova's parliament, Dmitry 
Motspan, who leads the Agrarian Democratic Party (INTERFAX note: 
parliamentary majority party) qualified the call for setting up 
a Russian military base in Moldova as political speculation. 
"Having proclaimed itself a demilitarized zone, Moldova does 
not accept the idea of turning Russia's 14th Army into a 
military base or maintaining the army on its soil under some 
other status," he told INTERFAX on Monday [16 May]. 
  "To define a political status for Trans-Dniestria and for 
the 
localities populated largely by the Gagauzi is a primary problem 
requiring urgent solution," Motspan said. According to him, 
"it would be good to determine the status of Trans-Dniestria and 
Gagauzi-populated localities prior to adopting a new 
Constitution, so that it could be reflected in the fundamental 
laws." 
  "A new constitution will have to be adopted no later than 
this autumn in any case," the deputy speaker said. "By that time 
some of the problems connected with the special status of 
Moldova's southern and eastern areas might remain unresolved," 
Motspan said. 
  If a new constitution is adopted earlier than a special 
status for Trans-Dniestria and the Gagauzi-populated areas is 
determined, "no amendments to the Constitution will be 
required," Motspan said. "The fundamental laws will state that 
Moldova is an independent state, and the establishment of a 
federation or confederation on its territory is inadmissible," 
he said. 
  The leader of Moldovan agrarians believes that another armed 
conflict in Trans-Dniestria must not be allowed to take place. 
At the same time he expressed willingness to "cooperate in the 
endeavors to resolve this and other problems with any political 
forces, even if they are not represented in the parliament."

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 13/5/1994 -- During the two 
months of the Parliament's activity, 99 important documents were 
adopted, stated Dumitru Motpan, chairman of the Moldovan 
Agrarian Democratic Party (PDAM), at a press conference held 
today by the governing party. The PDAM leader pronounced 
himself in favor of conducting elections to the local 
administrative organs in the near future and excluding from the 
future Constitution the words "federalization" and 
"confederalization." Motpan promised that "no later than 
November the Constitution will be adopted." Referring to 
detainee Ilascu's [Ilie Ilascu, sentenced to death by a Dniester 
court] problem, he expressed the certainty that Ilascu will not 
be executed. Motpan believes that Tiraspol tries to increase 
the price for Ilascu's release. He said that he knows nothing 
about some alleged guarantees made by Tiraspol leaders that 
Ilascu's life is out of danger. He also pointed out that during 
the last meeting between Moldovan and Gagauz representatives, 
"Gagauzians sent some extremists who want more the more they 
receive."

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 13/5/1994 -- The inflation rate 
during April in Moldova was 5 percent; this is a significant 
decrease in comparison with the previous months, indicates the 
State Department of Statistics report. In January, inflation 
stood at 44.5 percent, in February and March respectively 26.4 
percent and 13.4 percent. "The decrease in inflation, the 
recent fall in the interest rate and the stability of the 
national currency are signs that the economic reforms promoted 
by the Moldovan Government and National Bank begin to show their 
effects," states a communique of the IMF representation in 
Moldova. Michael Blackwell, IMF representative in Chisinau, 
believes that the fall in inflation will undoubtedly lead to 
economic growth and the awaited improvement of living standards. 
"The interest in investing in the Moldovan economy continues to 
grow," states the communique. It emphasizes that "the IMF and 
World Bank will continue to grant Moldova financial assistance." 
[words indistinct] financial-crediting policy attempting to 
reduce inflation to 1-3 percent by the end of the year and make 
it remain at the levels registered in European countries.

  [Excerpts] [no dateline as received] Prime Minister 
Tereshchenko has held a meeting with members of the government, 
heads of departments, major enterprises, national and joint 
stock companies, and holdings, and deputy heads of oblast 
administrations. Views were exchanged on the serious economic 
situation. Reports on the situation in their industries were 
presented by ministers of industry Salomatin; of power and fuel 
resources Baykenov; and of transport Isingarin. 
  As was pointed out at the meeting, production continues to 
decline. In the first quarter of this year it fell by 30 
percent. Extraction of oil dropped by 14.5 percent; of coal by 
10 percent; and of natural gas by 35 percent. Electric power 
output declined by 14 percent. 
  Despite the mutual writing-off of debts, mutual debts have 
reached a total of 24 billion tenge. Curbing inflation has 
become the most difficult task for the government. [passage 
omitted] 
  One tonne of oil is likely to cost $191 by yearend. Even now 
prices for fuel on the domestic market are higher than the world 
level. If the debts are not repaid, production of electricity 
will be reduced by a significant degree. 
  The main conclusion drawn during the meeting was the 
necessity to change pricing, first of all prices for fuel.

  [Text] By the beginning of May this year, workers at the 
Uzenneft Oil and Gas Recovery Directorate achieved good results, 
having recovered 272,509 tonnes of oil. This good result was 
achieved through reconstruction and the efficient use of 
technology and personnel. All eight oilfields worked 
concertedly along with other units of the Mangistaumunaygas 
production amalgamation. The fact that 91 wells have been 
commissioned from the mothballed fund and 10 wells automated has 
also played its role.

  [Text] Residential housing construction is a complicated 
matter, not only for a newly independent republic, but for any 
other developed nation. For this particular reason, measures 
envisaged by the president's decree and the law on residential 
housing are targeted at both creating a national housing market 
and promoting construction. One of the specific steps in this 
direction is setting up a housing banks network which will make 
low rate mortgages available for building detached houses and 
blocks of apartments. These banks will give priority in 
granting mortgages to people in great need of housing. 
  For the first time ever, mortgages will be given if secured 
against property collaterals. The state-owned housing will be 
built only for the socially unprotected groups of the 
population. Currently six housing banks are being set up in the 
Republic. One of them is located in Kokshetau. Now its 
leadership, together with the oblast administration and national 
bank's directorate, is training personnel and looking for 
finance. The oblast will now have 15 banks.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 17 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The situation on the 
Tajik-Afghan border has undergone virtually no significant 
change and remains tense. Military sources report that on 16 
May Russian border guards foiled two attempts by small groups of 
Tajik [opposition] fighters to cross the border in the Pyandzh 
and Khorog sectors. A day earlier, in the Shuroabad sector of 
the Moskovskiy border troop detachment, Russian border guards 
eliminated a group of Tajik fighters who penetrated into 
Tajikistan in order to perpetrate acts of sabotage. In the same 
sector, Russian border guards discovered a major clandestine 
arsenal of rockets belonging to the Tajik mujaheddin.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>
  [Text] Dushanbe, 14 May -- In the view of Col. Gen. Valeriy 
Patrikeyev, commander of the collective peace-keeping forces in 
Tajikistan, the sociopolitical situation in the Republic is 
gradually returning to normal. Making this statement at a news 
conference today, he linked this positive development with the 
constructive policy pursued by Tajikistan's leadership and with 
the efforts of the collective peace-keeping forces stationed 
here. This was the first public appearance before the press of 
the new commander, who replaced his predecessor on the post, 
Col. Gen. Boris Pyankov. 
  Valeriy Patrikeyev went on to emphasize that he had reached 
these optimistic conclusions following two weeks of officially 
studying the situation in Tajikistan and holding numerous 
meetings and discussions with the Republic's residents from 
virtually all regions, as well as with Tajikistan's top 
leadership. 
  At the same time the Russian general described as expedient 
the decision of the council of CIS heads of state held in Moscow 
on 15 April to extend the mandate of the collective 
peace-keeping forces until 31 December 1994, in view of 
continuing tensions on the Tajik-Afghan border. In the 
general's view, the intransigent Tajik opposition has not 
renounced its plans to destabilize the situation on individual 
stretches of the border; armed provocations against Russian 
border guards are continuing, as are attempts by armed fighters 
to break into Tajik territory. 
  The situation is particularly alarming in the Pamir sector, 
where enemy personnel and hardware concentration is continuing 
in the Afghan provinces bordering on Tajikistan. In the words 
of the commander, the obvious purpose of this provocation is to 
attempt to break through the border on a mass scale with 
subsequent deep penetration into the Republic's territory in 
order to conduct combat operations against the present 
government. However, all these attempts are doomed, the 
commander said. The collective peace-keeping forces and the 
national armed forces have sufficient resources to deal 
decisively with all these ventures. 
  At the same time Gen. Patrikeyev expressed himself in favor 
of political settlement of the Tajik conflict, noting that the 
military option was a dead end. "My dream is of the collective 
peace-keeping forces becoming redundant in the Republic with 
regard to their participation in hostilities. And I will do all 
I can in my capacity to settle the conflict by peaceful means," 
concluded the commander of the collective peace-keeping forces.

  [Text] The next round of talks between the Tajik leadership 
and the opposition is planned for 4 June in Tehran, one of the 
leaders of the Tajik opposition, former Muslim leader of the 
Republic and now Deputy Chairman of the Tajik Islamic Revival 
Movement, Akbar Turandzhonzoda, told INTERFAX on Monday [16 May]. 
  He said that the terms of the talks were agreed with the UN 
General Secretary's special envoy for Tajikistan Ramiro Prisi 
Bolion and Deputy UN General Secretary for political issues 
Marek Goulding. 
  Turadzhonzoda confirmed the opposition's readiness to sign 
an 
agreement on a temporary cease-fire. "I am surprised Dushanbe 
did not agree to sign this agreement during the first round of 
talks in Moscow on 5-19 April," he pointed out. 
  In the meantime, Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid Alimov did 
not 
confirm to INTERFAX that the talks with the opposition would 
continue in Tehran on 4 June. "In this issue we are oriented by 
UN representatives, but not Taradzhonzoda," he noted. 
  According to Alimov, a visit by UN representatives Bolion 
and 
Goulding to Dushanbe is planned for 25-27 May.

Shishlin] 
  [Text] The repatriation of all refugees by the end of this 
year is likely to double the country's rate of unemployment, 
Labor and Employment Minister Shukurjon Zuhurov told INTERFAX. 
  However, Zuhurov who leads a government delegation in peace 
talks with Tajik opposition entrenched in Afghanistan said the 
gloomy prospect would be able to force Dushanbe to go back on 
its main goal of getting all refugees return safely to their 
homes in Tajikistan. 
  The minister put last year's number of jobless at less than 
one million, but the figure may sour up to 1.5 million after the 
refugees come back from next door Afghanistan. 
  Asked whether it was worth bothering about repatriation at 
all then, Zukhurov said the government's main priority was to 
get the refugees back home while the problem of unemployment, 
also besetting other countries, would be resolved in the order 
of the day. 
  The minister said that the cabinet-proposed plan provides 
for 
only 100,000 new jobs if "the industry functions normally and 
proper investment is made," conditions that are likely to emerge 
only in five years from now. 
  One solution to the problem is to sign agreements with CIS 
states having their own Tajik communities on exports of extra 
workforce there, he said. 
  As an example, Zukhurov pointed to Turkmenistan hosting an 
estimated 50,000 Tajik refugees at the moment, but the local 
laws do not provide for their right to employment or housing or 
social security benefits. 
  Overall, the minister is optimistic about the prospects of 
normalization in Tajikistan. 
  And so is new commander of Russian troops in the region 
General-Colonel Valeriy Patrikeyev who spoke of things going 
back to normal in that country. 
  Speaking on Saturday, he said that Tajikistan was recovering 
from the shock of civil war following government measures and 
efforts taken by peacekeeping troops. At the same time, he 
spoke of high crime rates in the Republic and high tension on 
its border with Afghanistan.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridnyova] </F>
  [Text] Dushanbe 16 May TASS -- The Tajik Communist Party 
has called for the restoration of a renovated Soviet Union in 
the form of a federation as the only means to ensure the 
development of the political, economic, and spiritual potential 
of former Soviet republics. 
  Tajik communists' leader Shodiy Shabdolov told ITAR-TASS on 
Monday [16 May]that the disintegration of the Soviet Union and 
the parade of sovereignty that followed it have led to economic 
and political chaos in all republics. Radical market reforms 
"imposed by quasi- democrats" and "wild privatisation" have 
enriched a small group of nouveau riches and plunged the rest of 
the population in poverty and hunger, he said. 
  The mass drive for sovereignty was accompanied by armed 
inter-ethnic conflicts in many ex-Soviet republics and outburst 
of nationalism. Tajikistan was hit most hard. The civil war in 
the Republic claimed the lives of more than 100,000 people, 
Shabdolov said. 
  He noted that the majority of the population support Tajik 
communists' call for the restoration of the Soviet Union. Over 
one million people, about two-thirds of the adult population, 
signed appeals "for unity, brotherhood and friendship of the 
peoples of the USSR" adopted by numerous conferences and 
meetings held all across the Republic. 
  Supporters of the restoration of a renovated union held a 
founding congress of their movement in Dushanbe on Saturday. 
Apart from the communist party, the founders of the new 
movement include Tajik trade unions, the Union of Tajik Women, 
organisations of veterans and ethnic and cultural associations. 
  "We are confident that our movement is growing so strong 
that 
it cannot be stopped," Shabdolov said. He stressed that it will 
act within the framework of the law and use only constitutional 
methods. "We are against barricades and use of force," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, 17 May -- "Russia is losing Uzbekistan's 
market," Uzbek President Islam Karimov warned in an interview 
with ITAR-TASS today. The president arrived for a four-day 
visit to Japan on 16 May. 
  "It appears that Moscow does not realize that Russia could 
be 
squeezed out of Uzbekistan as a result of intensifying 
international competition for the emergent market in our 
republic," the president said. "Furthermore, we are eager to 
win foreign investment in order to develop our economy and to 
establish close ties with foreign enterprises and attract them 
to our market." Islam Karimov stressed that Uzbekistan wanted 
"to retain former links with Russia, but on a new basis." 
  The president of Uzbekistan called for the establishment of 
Russo-Uzbek joint ventures based on close ties between 
industrial enterprises in the two countries dating from the 
Soviet period. "We are establishing joint ventures with firms in 
various foreign countries. There are now about 1,500 joint 
ventures in our republic, but there is not one Russo-Uzbek 
company," the president noted. He pointed out that Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin also fully agreed that the two republics 
should set up joint ventures. 
  Islam Karimov stressed that "the peoples of Russia and 
Uzbekistan are bound by close spiritual ties." "The Russian 
people have always stood beside us during those times in our 
history when things were very difficult for us, and we do not 
forget this," the president said.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, 17 May -- Uzbek President Islam Karimov told 
ITAR-TASS today that Uzbekistan will conclude an agreement with 
the IMF this summer. He said Tashkent has officially endorsed 
this important document. The president, who is currently 
visiting Japan, said that the absence of this kind of agreement 
was delaying the implementation of Western programs to assist 
the Republic in its transition to a market economy. 
  The president noted that "unlike certain other former Soviet 
republics, which meekly agree to all IMF terms in order to gain 
access to foreign investment, Uzbekistan is approaching the IMF 
agreement with great circumspection, since its main concern is 
to develop the Republic's industrial base." Islam Karimov 
acknowledged that "the talks with the IMF about the agreement 
have been very long and difficult," but the work has now been 
completed. The Uzbek president said: "The document has been 
initialled by Uzbekistan" and will be officially endorsed by the 
IMF management this July, after which it will be signed. 
  Referring to Tashkent's economic policies, Islam Karimov 
noted that ever since embarking on reforms aimed at bringing in 
a market economy, Uzbekistan's objective is to "build a socially 
orientated economy" based on private enterprise, but to retain a 
significant regulatory role for the state. "We have never 
sought to force the pace of reform, believing that it is 
necessary to build a new house before destroying the old one," 
the president said. He warned other former Soviet republics 
that are building a market economy against being too hasty in 
what they do, pointing out that "attempts to force the pace of 
reform could discredit the market economy in the eyes of the 
public."

  [Text] Tokyo 17 May TASS -- "Work is now nearing completion 
on the foundation for the rapid development of economic 
relations between Uzbekistan and Japan," Uzbek President Islam 
Karimov told ITAR-TASS. Karimov arrived for a four-day visit to 
Japan on Monday. According to the president, the key purpose of 
this visit is to promote economic cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  "Japanese businessmen are very cautious in their approach to 
the tapping of the Uzbek market, which is new for them," Karimov 
said. "They have been carefully studying Uzbekistan for the past 
one and a half years, focusing their main attention to the 
assessment of the political stability in the Republic, which is 
an inalienable precondition for the development of economic 
cooperation. Now this work is nearing completion." Today, 
Japan is adopting important decisions on economic cooperation 
with Uzbekistan at government level. Some major Japanese 
private companies are getting down to business on the Uzbek 
market, the president added. 
  At the same time, Karimov complained against the shortage of 
information on Uzbekistan in foreign countries, including Japan. 
He noted that the new Uzbek laws and government decisions, 
aimed at creating optimal conditions for the operation of 
foreign companies, were still unknown in Japan. In connection 
with the claims of the Japanese press that foreign companies 
were heavily taxed in Uzbekistan, Karimov said that there was an 
Uzbek law exempting joint ventures, in which there are more than 
10 per cent of foreign capital, from state taxation for a period 
of five years. All customs duties on imported goods are fully 
annulled in the republic until 1 July 1995. "We have created 
all the necessary conditions for foreign investors," the Uzbek 
president said. 
  Touching on his visit to Japan, Karimov noted that 
Uzbekistan 
was planning to study most seriously Japan's experience in 
restoring its economy after the war and to use it in the 
Republic.

  [Text] The achievement of economic independence by 
Uzbekistan "will require time," and in the meantime the country, 
relying on CIS mechanisms, must develop economic integration and 
also attract foreign aid, Republic President Islam Karimov 
stated in an interview in Tashkent with a group of Japanese

  He noted that the idea of setting up a "Eurasian community" 
in the place of the CIS, proposed by Kazakhstani President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev, "is only a new slogan, deliberately put 
forward with the aim of strengthening this leader's personal 
authority."

  [Text] The concluding talks on economic cooperation between 
the representative of Uzbekistan's Government and a delegation 
from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and 
Development was held yesterday [13 May] in the Uzbek Cabinet of 
Ministers. As is known, the German delegation, led by Berhard 
Schweiger, has been in our country for a week. The members of 
the delegation have familiarized themselves with the work of the 
first joint Uzbek-German enterprises and the activities of 
various ministries and departments. The members of the 
delegation also visited Bukhara, Urgench, Khiva, and Nukus. 
  The results of the talks were discussed in the Cabinet of 
Ministers. An intergovernmental protocol and an agreement on 
financial and technical cooperation were signed. The documents 
were signed by Uzbekistan's Deputy Prime Minister Sultanov, and 
Berhard Schweiger from the German delegation. The protocol 
outlines cooperation in such areas as research, training of 
personell, joint implementation of projects in agriculture, 
increasing the effectiveness of the communication system, 
reconstruction of the airport in Tashkent, and cooperation in 
public health. 
  We have found sincere and reliable people here, stated the 
head of the German delegation on the concluding day of the 
talks. I hope that our friendship will become stronger, not 
only in words but in actions. This is shown by the signed 
documents, which are aimed at stregnthening our cooperation. 
The German state will continue to provide all-round support for 
the economic reforms being carried out by the Government of 
Uzbekistan. 
  We are confident that the Republic of Uzbekistan will become 
our most close partner in Central Asia. Doctor Karl-Heinz 
Khuna, plenipotentiary and ambassador extraordinary of Germany 
in Uzbekistan, participated in the talks.

  [Text] Yerevan, 16 May (SNARK)--A meeting of CSCE's Minsk 
Group representative Ian Eliasson and Russian President's 
Special Envoy Vladimir Kazimirov with the leaders of 
Nagorno-Karabakh was held in Yerevan. The meeting was 
transferred there from Stepanakert, where it was supposed to be, 
at the request of the CSCE and RF [as received] representatives. 
The reason was the bad weather that did not allow them to visit 
the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  As acting Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Soviet Chairman Karen 
Baburyan told SNARK, the sides agreed that it was necessary to 
combine CSCE's and Russia's intermediary efforts in order to 
obtain stable and guaranteed truce. The latter will be the 
cornerstone of the further gradual settlement of all the 
problems connected with Nagorno-Karabakh. The Karabakh side, 
represented by the Supreme Soviet Chairman, as well as the 
Chairman of Karabakh State Committee for Defence Robert 
Kocharyan, and Foreign Affairs Minister Arkadiy Gukasyan, put 
forward their proposals. 
  "I consider this meeting to be positive, at least because 
the 
representative of Russia came to Karabakh together with the 
Minsk Group representative," said, in particular, Karen 
Baburyan. In his words, this fact testifies to the tendency of 
combining the efforts of CSCE and Russia in the way of peaceful 
settlement of the conflict.

<F P=106> [Interview with RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] </F>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Arkadiy Gukasyan by an unidentified 
correspondent in Stepanakert on 14 May] 
  [Text] Stepanakert ("AZG" daily), 05/14/94--[Correspondent] 
What's the external policy of the RMK Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs? 
  [Gukasyan] A public opinion survey, carried in Mountainous 
Karabakh, has shown that our people voted for independence. 
Today the RMK Ministry of Foreign Affairs is implementing the 
will of Karabakh people. Our work is directed to stipulate 
recognition of the RMK independence. 
  [Correspondent] In what way is this work coordinated with 
negotiations within CIS, CSCE and UN frameworks? 
  [Gukasyan] The work, carried out within CIS, CSCE and UN 
frameworks, is of tactical nature. But the strategy remains the 
same. We have to deal with the international community, with 
the opinions of foreign countries and international 
organizations, with international law norms. In our opinion, if 
we succeed in shifting the struggle from the battlefield into 
the political arena, if we sit at a negotiations table, we'll 
have an opportunity to present our arguments, which, we believe, 
are sufficient for recognition of the RMK. 
  Our main problem is to stop the military operations. Only 
then will it be possible to resolve political problems. 
Azerbaijan is not ready to a cease fire today. In my opinion, 
the Azeri Government didn't give up the idea of resolving the 
Karabakh problem by force yet. They still hope that military 
success may create a favorable political situation for future 
negotiations. This is a mere illusion, and the Azeri Government 
will have to meet the reality, and sit at the negotiations table 
together with the RMK authorities. I do not exclude the 
possibility that this may be already a new government of 
Azerbaijan. 
  [Correspondent] In your opinion, how many ways for resolving 
the Karabakh conflict are offered by different political forces 
in Azerbaijan? 
  [Gukasyan] There is only one opinion in Azerbaijan regarding 
the resolution of the Karabakh conflict. I can't see other 
forces in Azerbaijan, which would act today differently than the 
current Azeri government. The problem is -- which politicians 
will be smart enough to give up force methods. And as long as 
Aliyev is unable to give these up, the situation may end up with 
a shift of power in Azerbaijan. 
  [Correspondent] Do you agree with the concept of 
"Territories 
for peace", as suggested by the Chairman of the RA [Republic of 
Armenia] Supreme Council? 
  [Gukasyan] We agree with the concept but we always try to 
explain what "peace" means in essence. In our opinion, peace is 
only possible after a final status of Mountainous Karabakh is 
defined. Without resolving the problem of status, the danger 
will persist. In other words, as long as the problem is not 
resolved finally, peace is impossible. 
  [Correspondent] You agreed with stationing disengagement 
forces along the whole length of the front line. Do you think, 
these forces may become an obstacle to the goals of the RMK? 
  [Gukasyan] The risk factor has always existed. It was 
present when we pulled the problem of Mountainous Karabakh and 
took the responsibility for defending (our country) from an 
Azeri aggression, and now, when we try to shift from the sphere 
of war and to switch into the sphere of peace. We have been 
always taking risk. Risk is inevitable. But if resolution of 
the problem is related with a choice between war or peace, we 
always prefer peace. Though risking, the RMK government will 
try to gain not only international guarantees in the stage of 
transition to peace, but will take measures to insure security 
with our own forces. 
  [Correspondent] Azerbaijan does not accept the idea of 
stationing peace-making forces. Which forces would you prefer 
-- CSCE or Russian? 
  [Gukasyan] The most important thing for us is to have 
international guarantees. The more guarantees, the better. CIS 
guarantees are good, UN guarantees are even better, and to have 
both together would be an ideal case. In our opinion, the 
status of Mountainous Karabakh should not depend on will of 
Azerbaijan or other countries. 
  [Correspondent] Azeri journalists have been clearly 
indicating that third forces hinder, and have been pointing at 
Russia. In your opinion, could the current situation be 
possibly reached by means of bilateral negotiations? 
[Gukasyan] If there is such a notion in Azerbaijan, then I 
can't understand why the Azeri leaders are not willing to sit at 
the negotiations table with the RMK. Unfortunately, this is not 
true, and this proves once again that the Azeri government is 
not sincere in its evaluations. 
  [Correspondent] Azerbaijan continues stating, that Karabakh 
continues implementing the policy of Armenia. How would you 
evaluate the Armenia-Karabakh relations in the sphere of 
external relations? What's the rate of their influence upon 
each other? 
  [Gukasyan] Armenia and the RMK are completely independent in 
their external policies. Of course, this does not exclude some 
agreement in our positions. Our opinions differ in several 
questions. We do not face any pressure by Armenia in this 
regard. Karabakh carries an independent external policy. 
Regarding the policy of Azeri leaders -- they have 
psychological difficulties in understand the fact that 
Mountainous Karabakh is now a separate military and political 
entity. We are in friendly relations with the Armenian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. Our different positions regarding several 
questions do not hinder to carry a coordinated policy. 
  The RMK external policy is developed in Stepanakert, and if 
it doesn't coincide with the opinion of the Armenian 
authorities, they understand that Karabakh should defend its 
opinion. 
  [Correspondent] How do you see the future of Armenia-RMK 
relations? Would it be a single entity or separate units? 
  [Gukasyan] I see Mountainous Karabakh as an independent 
country, though I do not exclude the possibility that Karabakh 
may become a part of Armenia.

friendship." 
  The Armenian leader expressed the confidence that the 
accident will not affect relations between the two nations and 
that the Georgian authorities will take all necessary measures 
to find and punish the terrorists and prevent terroristic acts

relatively calm in the Karabakh conflict area. 
  At the same time several population centers in two border 
districts of Azerbaijan -- Kazakh and Tauz -- came under fire. 
This resulted in neither casualties nor destruction. 
  In the meantime, the headquarters of Nagorno-Karabakh's 
Defence Army reports that Sunday [15 May] night and Monday 
morning Azeri troops opened fire on the positions of Karabakh 
forces in the Mardakert, Agdam and Askeran directions, wounding 
two soldiers.

  [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the 
latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the 
border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  The mediation effort by Russia and the CSCE to restore peace 
in the region has begun to yield positive results. The 
cease-fire agreement, which will be signed at the talks between 
the defense ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan and the 
representatives of the NKR Defense Army to be held in Moscow 
today, will be a step in that direction. However, several 
forces, establishments, and organizations opposed to the leading 
officials in Azerbaijan have seriously criticized that 
republic's signing of the Bishkek protocol. 
  It is no coincidence that, compared with the situation of a 
few days ago, the number of intensive combat operations in the 
region has considerably decreased. However, exchanges of fire 
have not completely ended. Undoubtedly, many military officials 
in Azerbaijan support the opposition forces in that republic. 
  We stressed earlier that the Armenian side is trying not to 
return fire in order to avoid worsening the present situation. 
In fact, it is trying to counter any activity that may violate 
the Bishkek protocol. However, the Azerbaijani forces have 
maintained intensive operations. Nevertheless, to be fair we 
must note that the present operations are in the form of 
positional fighting. The situation is complex. 
  The NKR Defense Army Headquarters Press Service has 
disclosed 
that the NKR positions in Mardakertskiy, Agdamskiy, and 
Askeranskiy Rayons were fired by various types or arms last 
night and this morning. Two NKR freedom fighters were wounded. 
The NKR defense forces remained committed to the NKR Defense 
Army Headquarters' order to refrain from opening fire. They 
refrained from launching retaliatory operations. 
  Meanwhile, intelligence units have reported that Azerbaijan 
is presently massing reinforcements and military vehicles in the 
northern part of Mardakertskiy Rayon. 
  No incidents occurred on the border between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan last night and this morning. Nevertheless, the 
situation is tense.

comes out for the solution of the Karabakh conflict by means of 
international organisations and welcomes the presence of 
international forces. 
  Aliyev pointed out that "once Baku realised the importance 
of 
reconciliation, one can say that we have approached a final 
solution of this problem." Aliyev pointed out the importance of 
the realisation of the closeness of positions on concrete 
matters which recently appeared, taking into account the 
complexity of the situation for each side concerned. 
  The Azeri president expressed satisfaction at close 
interaction between Russia and the CSCE. 
  For his part, Eliasson said that they are as close to the 
settlement of the Azeri-Armenian conflict as never before. It 
is important not to miss the chance, he said. 
  In his opinion, there are a number of factors offering a 
real 
chance for the settlement of the conflict: There is a good 
alliance of leaders capable of taking bold decisions; CSCE 
streamlines cooperation with Russia in the negotiating process, 
in particular, as far as the deployment of observers in the zone 
of the conflict is concerned; the activities of the Minsk Group 
are supported by CSCE countries. 
  Eliasson believes it is important to strengthen the regime 
of 
the ceasefire by means of a mechanism of monitoring with the 
CSCE participation, to work out joint measures for the 
comprehensive implementation of given tasks. All this was 
reflected in the document worked out by the Minsk Group, which 
was submitted to the Azeri and Armenian sides, taking into 
account Azerbaijan's proposals.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on interview with Jan Eliasson, </F>
chairman of the CSCE Minsk Conference on Nagorno-Karabakh, by 
unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent: "J. Eliasson in Favor of 
Joint Actions"] 
  [Text] Jan Eliasson (Sweden), chairman of the CSCE Minsk 
conference on Nagorno-Karabakh, has expressed support for close 
collaboration between the CSCE and the CIS in settling the 
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 
  "At the present stage, I think it is essential to 
consolidate 
the state of cease-fire in accordance with the commitments, 
which the sides have undertaken," he stated in an interview with 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the eve of his trip to the crisis 
region, which begins this week. The cease-fire, J. Eliasson 
believes, should be accompanied by specific measures. It is 
necessary to try to form an observer group with the 
participation of both the CSCE and the CIS, so that the 
observers can work together as closely as possible. 
  "I hope that we will be able to take other steps too, 
including the withdrawal of troops, the removal of obstacles to 
transportation, the return of refugees, and the establishment of 
military and political guarantees," the chairman of the Minsk 
conference noted. "It is exceptionally important that we take 
measures now, otherwise the risk of an escalation of the 
conflict will be great. Joint actions on our part are extremely 
important." 
  J. Eliasson sees the task of his forthcoming trip to the 
conflict zone as trying to "stabilize" as far as possible the 
cease-fire situation, which is to be monitored by CSCE and CIS 
representatives. He intends to hold meetings with "all 
leaders." It is proposed that the visit will last one week.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>
  [Text] Yerevan, 16 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Our main task is to 
put an end to military activity and only then will it be 
possible to settle the political questions, said 
Nagorno-Karabakh's Foreign Minister Arkadiy Gukasyan. In an 
interview with the Yerevan newspaper AZG, he said he does not 
think Azerbaijan is ready today for a cease-fire and that the 
leaders of that republic are unable to abandon the illusion that 
the Karabakh problem can be settled using force. The 
Azerbaijani authorities, A. Gukasyan said, hope that military 
victories will create political conditions, which will act in 
their favor during subsequent talks. But Azerbaijan's 
leadership will very soon have to acknowledge the real situation 
that has taken shape and sit at the talks table with the leaders 
of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, the minister believes. "I 
do not rule out that it will be a new Azerbaijani leadership 
[that sits at the table]," the Karabakh representative said. 
  The issue is whether they in Azerbaijan can find the 
strength 
in themselves to renounce force as a means of settling the 
conflict, A.Gukasyan said, and since Geydar Aliyev cannot do 
this, there is a likelihood of developments leading to a change 
in Azerbaijan's leadership, the Karabakh minister said. 
  We have to take into consideration the international 
community, the opinions of various states and organizations, and 
the norms of international law, the head of Karabakh's Foreign 
Ministry continued. Karabakh believes that if the fighting on 
the battlefields can be brought within the framework of a 
political struggle, then Stepanakert will have the opportunity 
to present its arguments, which, the people of Karabakh believe, 
suffice to justify recognition of the independence of the 
Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  A. Gukasyan also said that full peace in the region will 
only 
be possible after the issue of Karabakh's status had been 
settled once and for all. Without this, there will always be 
the danger that military activities will be resumed, he said. 
Peace is not possible without settling the issue of Karabakh's 
status, the minister said.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 May -- At the Russian Foreign Ministry in 
Moscow, the Georgian and Abkhazian sides signed today an 
agreement on a cease-fire and disengagement of forces in the 
area of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, the Russian Foreign 
Ministry has reported. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry reports the Russia Federation 
Government made a statement regarding the signing of the 
agreement in which it expressed satisfaction with this important 
step aimed at ensuring a stable peace. 
  The statement says the aim of a safety zone which is to be 
created in line with the agreement and which will be used for 
the deployment of CIS peacekeeping forces is to help prevent the 
resumption of military actions and make it possible for refugees 
to return to their places of permanent residence and, first and 
foremost, to Gali Rayon. 
  The Russian Government expressed confidence that the sides 
in 
the conflict would strictly follow their commitments. On its 
part, Russia is aware of its responsibility and it is prepared, 
jointly with the United Nations, to help achieve a full-scale 
settlement and to strive towards a situation in which the 
current stage is followed by new efforts aimed at restoring 
peace and mutual understanding in the region.

    [Editorial Report] Tbilisi Radio Tbilisi Network in 
Georgian at 0515 GMT on 16 May was intercepted in progress 
broadcasting a debate between Aleksandre Kavsadze, a senior 
Georgian negotiator with the Abkhazians, and Deputy Ivliane 
Khaindrava, one of the leaders of the opposition Republican 
Party. 
  At the beginning of the intercept Kavsadze presents a 
clause-by-clause interpretation of the Georgian-Abkhaz agreement 
signed in Moscow 14 May. He says that, unlike previous 
agreements, the only signatories to this deal are the Georgian 
and Abkhaz sides. The Moscow agreement has not been signed by 
either Russia or the United Nations, he says, and continues: 
  "The first article of the cease-fire and disengagement 
agreement says that the sides bind themselves to stop 
hostilities and not to use force against each other. This was 
also mentioned in other documents signed since December last 
year. However, this time we have an agreement, rather than a 
statement, a memorandum of understanding, or some other 
document. It is an agreement signed by two sides -- the 
Georgian and the Abkhaz sides. 
  ``The second article says that the armed forces should be 
disengaged from each other. It also outlines the disengagement 
principle. The reason why I am not paying too much attention to 
the absence of disengagement charts is that only a principle of 
disengagement was formulated, rather than an entire procedure. 
Under this principle, the sides are to be separated and the 
buffer zone is to be filled by a peace-keeping force. That is 
what the principle is. 
  ``The third article is about who should be deployed and how. 
It says: The precise marking of the lines of disengagement and 
a detailed chart for the disengagement of forces is to be drawn 
up by the sides within the framework of a stage-by-stage 
full-scale settlement. [Preceeding sentence spoken in Russian] 
In this connection, a working group is to be formed, which will 
clarify these issues, draw up a chart, which will show who 
should be deployed where in order to maintain peace. 
  ``The fourth article outlines in general terms the mandate 
of 
this force. The aims and purposes of this peacekeeping force 
are still to be finalized. Its main function should be to 
maintain peace and create conditions for the return of refugees. 
  ``The agreement also includes articles five, six, and seven. 
  ``The fifth article says that full-scale negotiations on 
conflict settlement are to be continued. 
  ``The sixth article requests the UN and its Security Council 
to renew and broaden the mandate of UN military observers in 
Abkhazia, so that their involvement can be more active and 
efficient.'' 
  After further remarks which are indistinct owing to poor 
reception, Kavsadze concludes by saying that this agreement 
alone only lays the foundation for the return of ethnic Georgian 
refugees to Abkhazia and that another deal is needed for the 
actual process to get started.

  [Text] The Georgian leader, Eduard Shevardnadze, has 
described the agreement to cease-fire and disengage the Georgian 
and Abkhazian units reached in Moscow on Saturday [14 May] as 
"genuine foundations for the return of refugees to Abkhazia." 
  In his traditional interview for Georgian radio given on 
Mondays Shevardnadze noted that the process of deploying 
peacekeeping forces in the conflict area "will not be long." A 
plan for deploying disengagement forces will be worked out soon, 
he said. According to Shevardnadze, Russia is playing a 
particularly active role in this work. The U.N. Security 
Council and the CIS Collective Security Council will consider 
the plan in the near future. "I think that we'll get support in 
both organizations," Shevardnadze said. 
  With reference to the work of the country's parliament the 
Georgian leader said that different political forces call for 
early parliamentary elections. They include the opposition and 
the party he leads -- the Union of Georgian Citizens, he said. 
"This issue remains open," Shevardnadze said. "My own stand 
will depend largely on how constructive the parliament's work 
will be." 
  The Georgian leader expressed solidarity with the demands of 
"some sections of society, particularly intellectuals," for 
strengthening the country's executive authorities. 
  With reference to the visit to Tbilisi by President Geydar 
Aliyev of Azerbaijan expected this week, Shevardnadze said that 
their discussions will focus on the situation in the Caucasus. 
"A dialogue on the situation in the Caucasus must be constant 
between the leaders of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia," 
he pointed out.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 92 (582): </F>
Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] The head of state Eduard Shevardnadze has turned 
down the accusations of the opposition which saw encroachments 
on the territorial integrity of Georgia in the Georgian-Abkhaz 
agreement signed last Saturday [14 May] in Moscow. He said 
there is not a word about the sovereignty or state system of 
Abkhazia in the document. 
  He said the problem would be resolved later and Abkhazia 
would get a new political status, but within integral Georgia. 
  Shevardnadze also denied the speculations of his opponents 
in 
parliaments claiming that Russia wants to send its troops to the 
conflict zone to secure the independence of Abkhazia and its 
separation from Georgia. He declared that divided Georgia is 
not in the interests of Russia and expressed confidence that in 
the near future Abkhazia would be returned. 
  IF [INTERFAX] Note: At the talks that ended in Moscow on 14 
May the Georgian and Abkhaz delegations agreed on the separation 
of troops and deployment of a CIS peace-keeping force on the 
confrontation line. Under the agreement, the formations of the 
two sides should withdraw 12 km from the Inguri river thus 
forming a 24 km buffer zone that will be occupied by the 
peace-keepers. 
  According to a member of the Abkhazian delegation, a special 
envoy of the chairman of the Abkhaz parliament Andrey Jergenia, 
Russia troops are most likely to become the separating force. 
He said that the deployment of the peace-keeping force should 
be completed by the end of May. There will be a total of 2500 
to 3000 peace-keepers. Russian units stationed in Abkhazia will 
be used among others. Jergenia said the Georgian side insisted 
on including in the agreement a provision on the patrolling of 
Kodor canyon in Abkhazia by peace-keepers. 
  In an interview with local television Shevardnadze also said 
that if the Georgian delegation had refused to sign the 
cease-fire agreement in Moscow on which Georgian MP's insisted, 
it would mean that Georgia was giving up a peaceful settlement 
and opting for a military solution. Shevardnadze is convinced 
that Georgia could not afford that either morally or from the 
viewpoint of its possibilities. 
  IF Note: The decision of parliament prohibiting the Georgian 
delegation to sign any documents in Moscow had no legal force 
because in making it the parliament exceeded its powers. Under 
acting legislation, the head of state has the right to hold 
talks and sign any documents on behalf of the country. The 
powers were given to Shevardnadze by the parliament. 
  In an interview with INTERFAX the opposition leader Boris 
Kakubava said that the disregard for the decision of parliament 
means complete arbitrariness of the authorities. He believes it 
is impossible to speak of any democracy in Georgia after the 
binding agreement was signed in Moscow. 
  Speaking of the essence of the agreement Kakubava declared 
that it allowed the Abkhazian side to legalize the genocide of 
Georgians and wrote off thousands of lost lives. He said:"Our 
organization, the Union for the Liberation of Abkhazia that 
represents the interests of the overwhelming majority of 
refugees from Abkhazia cannot agree to that. We have our own 
road back to Abkhazia." 
  At the press center of the Georgian Defence Ministry 
INTERFAX 
was told that the armed forces will carry out any orders from 
the head of state and Supreme Commander Eduard Shevardnadze. 
Troops and military hardware will be withdrawn from the Inguri 
river and a buffer zone will be formed that will be occupied by 
a peace-making force, a press center official said. 
  In a traditional Monday radio interview Shevardnadze called 
the Moscow agreement a practical foundation for the return of 
refugees to Abkhazia. He said the process would not be long. 
  Shevardnadze said a plan of sending a peace-keeping force to 
the conflict zone is being made which gives an especially active 
role to Russia. In the nearest future the plan is going to be 
discussed by the UN Security Council and the CIS Collective 
Security Council. The Georgian leader hoped for support from 
both organizations. 
  Shevardnadze described the activities of parliament as 
confrontational and said that different political groups are 
demanding early parliamentary elections. He said the question 
is raised by the opposition as well as the Union of Georgian 
Citizens he heads. "The question is open so far. My stand is 
going to largely depend on the degree of constructiveness of the 
parliament," Shevardnadze said. 
  According to the Georgian leader, certain social groups, 
intellectuals in particular, demand stronger executive power 
with the purpose of restoring order in the country. 
Shevardnadze said that today he favors greater toughness and 
responsibility. 
  On the coming visit to Tbilisi by the president of 
Azerbaijan 
Shevardnadze said that the talks will center mainly around the 
situation in the Caucasus and ways of resolving local problems 
as well as bilateral relations which he said are developing 
perfectly. 
  "I think that a dialogue on the situation in the Caucasus 
should become regular between the leaders of Georgia, Armenia, 
Azerbaijan and Russia," Shevardnadze said.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 16 May -- The Abkhazian Liberation Union 
brought an action at the Georgian Supreme Court for instituting 
criminal proceedings against Eduard Shevardnadze, head of the 
Georgian state, on the basis of Clause 65 of the Criminal Law of 
the Republic of Georgia. The clause deals with the betrayal of 
the country manifested in the fight against the country's 
territorial integrity and independence. The above-mentioned 
action was caused by the Georgian delegation's signing of the 
agreement reached at the Georgian-Abkhaz talks in Moscow.

<F P=106> [Report by GIA for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Tbilisi 16 May TASS -- Chairman of the Georgian 
parliament, Eduard Shevardnadze, met with visiting lawmakers of 
the Russian state Duma, deputy chairman of the Duma Committee 
for Affairs of the Commonwealth, Vyacheslav Igrunov, and 
chairman of the Duma Counting Commission, Khachim Karmokov, on 
Monday [16 May]. 
  The delegation of Russian parliamentarians arrived in 
Georgia 
to attend a session of the political committee of the 
parliamentary assembly for economic cooperation of Black Sea 
countries. Participants pointed out that they are pinning great 
hopes on the assembly as another factor of strengthening peace 
in the world. 
  The talks between Shevardnadze and the Russian lawmakers 
focused on Russo-Georgian relations. It was pointed out that 
the break off of political, economic and cultural ties which 
traditionally existed between the Russian and the Georgian 
people runs contrary to their interests. The sides pointed out 
that considerable efforts should be made to bring these 
relations to a new level. Prerequisites for this have been 
created by documents signed by the Russian president and the 
Georgian leader in Tbilisi. Parliamentarins of the two 
countries should consider the documents with a great sense of 
responsibility and ratify them in time, the sides said. In this 
connection, both sides expressed an intention to step up 
contacts between Russian and Georgian parliamentarians. 
  The meeting was attended by the Russian ambassador to 
Georgia, Vladimir Zemskiy.

  [Text] It will be impossible to ensure a ceasefire and 
return of refugees without the introduction of CIS peacekeeping 
forces to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. This was 
stated by Russian presidential envoy, Deputy Russian Foreign 
Minister Boris Pastukhov in an interview with INTERFAX today. 
  Pastukhov suggested that the talks between Georgian and 
Abkhazian representatives, which finished in Moscow on 14 May 
had been "absolutely necessary." The talks showed that the 
parties were "moving towards a dialogue and their permanent 
contacts were of great importance," he added. 
  Pastukhov highly praised the Georgian-Abkhazian documents 
signed in Moscow. They include the agreement on ceasefire, 
separation of the troops, deployment of the CIS peacekeeping 
contingency between the conflicting parties and the 
establishment of a joint coordinating commission on energy 
supply, transport communications, etc. The commission will have 
its permanent seat in Sochi from 1 June. "The most valuable 
thing about this commission is that the parties will always be 
looking into the faces of each other and openly discussing what 
worries them," Pastukhov underlined. 
  Commenting on the deployment of CIS peacekeeping forces on 
the Inguri River, he emphasized that details of the operation 
must still be worked on. "The CIS heads of state will express 
their opinion on the operation. Thereafter, the plan will be 
discussed with the conflicting parties. We take as our basis an 
initial number of about 3,000 people for the peacekeeping 
forces," Pastukhov said. 
  He stressed that the issue on CIS peacekeepers had been 
worked on during numerous consultations with the UN and the 
CSCE. "We hope that the peacekeeping operation itself will be 
carried out with the active participation of international 
observers in the conflict zone. It will probably be reasonable 
to widen their mandate and to increase their number," Pastukhov 
suggested. 
  He said the Russian party was quietly optimistic on 
implementation of the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia. 
"Earlier, we had also had rather strong decisions which 
unfortunately were never carried out. It is necessary to say 
less and to do more," Pastukhov accentuated. 
  He announced that Georgian and Abkhazian representatives 
would meet in Geneva on 13 June in order to work out solutions 
with which everyone would be satisfied.

  [Text] Riga, 13 May (LETA) -- On Thursday [12 May] Latvian 
Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs received the Russian Ambassador, 
Alexander Rannikh, who presented a fixed timetable for the 
Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia. During the handover of 
the document the Deputy Commander of Western Military Group 
Fedor Melnichuk, the Commander of the Latvian defence forces, 
Dainis Turlais, and other officials were present. 
  Under the document Russia pledges to withdraw all military 
ships from Liepaja and Ventspils by 1 June. However, as the 
Latvian premier stated after having viewed the timetable, the 
document is a detailed variant of the previous one handed over 
earlier and indicates 14 military units whose presence Latvia 
was not aware of. The agreement provides that Russia must 
present a full timetable of its forces pullout which is to be 
accomplished in June under the agreements signed in Moscow. 
  Speaking on whether the Russian Army will be withdrawn 
earlier than by 31 August, Birkavs said that the new timetable 
indicates only this date as a deadline, although Mr. Melnichuk 
reminded during the talk that Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
has instructed Minister of Defence Pavel Grachev to speed up the 
process. All issues concerning troop withdrawal will be 
discussed at the special government session on Friday where 
commissioners for the control over the Latvian-Russian 
withdrawal agreements were confirmed. 
  The prime minister highlighted unpleasant news reported from 
the firing ground in Adazi, whose installations were destroyed 
and plundered. This incident will be specially discussed with 
the commandment of the north-western military group.

  [Text] Riga, 13 May, BNS -- Latvia's foreign and defense 
ministers will join the Western European Union's [WEU] sessions 
and the Latvian Government will build closer contacts with WEU 
Governments since the Baltic country received associate 
partnership of the group, Justice Minister Egils Levits told 
reporters Thursday [12 May]. 
  The partnership of the European Union's fledgling defense 
group will help Latvia regulate relations with Russia, Levits 
said. 
  Levits described cooperation with the WEU as "entrance into 
NATO via detour." 
  As reported, the three Baltic republics of Latvia, 
Lithuania, 
and Estonia, as well as six East European countries, were 
offered WEU "associate partner" status Monday in Luxembourg. 
  In addition, the Baltic defense ministers met in Luxembourg 
by themselves and decided to join efforts to refute Russia's 
"alternative Partnership for Peace" program in the forthcoming 
Nordic defense ministers' conference, said Latvian Defense 
Minister Valdis Pavlovskis.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas </F>
Slezevicius by Ruta Grineviciute under the "Opinions" rubric; 
place and date not given: "VAT -- Against S. Urniezius"] 
  [Text] [Grineviciute] For the second week running, 
RESPUBLIKA has failed to receive a reply as to how much money 
the VAT [value-added tax] will contribute to the state budget. 
Finance Minister E. Vilkelis has said: "No one can say how 
much budget revenues will increase." Maybe you know the answer? 
  [Slezevicius] While debating the budget law, the Seimas 
[parliament] estimated budget revenues from the VAT at 967 
million litai, or 25 percent. 
  The VAT is a long-term rather than a temporary economic 
policy measure. This tax does not uphold the government's 
popularity, because its introduction increases prices. On the 
other hand, however, the VAT makes the collection of taxes more 
effective and, thus, disciplines the community. 
  [Grineviciute] Prior to the VAT, you used to say that the 
total of collected taxes accounted for about 30 percent. What 
is the VAT ratio in this respect? 
  [Slezevicius] This should be assessed by experts. I myself 
have not drafted such predictions. One can say, however, that 
the collection of taxes in our state is ineffective, and that 
there are many ways to evade them. The tax system that is being 
projected now should improve the situation. 
  Another aspect of the same problem is responsibility for the 
nonpayment of taxes. We are planning to rally a group of 
lawyers who will draft specific laws on combating this 
phenomenon. These documents will be of the same type as the law 
on preventive detention. 
  [Grineviciute] Are you drawing a parallel between the 
nonpayment of taxes and organized crime? 
  [Slezevicius] The latter are alike, according to the 
importance, severity, and effectiveness of these measures. 
  [Grineviciute] However, if in cases of businessmen who do 
not 
pay taxes, we resort to measures similar to those that are 
applied to organized criminals, we could jail all businessmen 
after doing our best. 
  [Slezevicius] I suppose that there are quite a few companies 
and firms (I have worked in business and I know this) that do 
not engage in illegal trade. Every respectable businessman is 
moving away from the shadow economy. Finally, we will apply 
economic rather than physical (imprisonment -- R.G.) measures. 
  [Grineviciute] In your opinion, can these laws be 
retroactive? Should they create conditions for law enforcement 
institutions to inquire into the manner in which the capital 
stock of firms was accumulated? 
  [Slezevicius] Certainly, we should choose the zero option 
and 
leave history intact. 
  [Grineviciute] How would you comment on the fact that over 
the first days after the VAT introduction, contrary to the 
predictions of government experts, gas and bread prices went up 
by about 30 percent, while lines appeared on the border, because 
customs services began to collect the VAT? 
  [Slezevicius] We have always said that this temporary price 
hike is linked with the desire of separate commercial structures 
to earn surplus profits over the short term. There are no 
objective reasons for the price rise to exceed 18 percent (the 
VAT). Traders will have to reduce their prices, otherwise, 
their turnover will decline. 
  The rush at the border should not be explained by the 
unpreparedness for the VAT introduction, but it should be 
interpreted as the businessmen's great desire to bring goods 
into our country before 1 May. 
  [Grineviciute] How do you plan to collect the VAT? Thus far, 
this has depended on a person collecting the VAT, on his "price." 
  [Slezevicius] This tax is perfect because it does not allow 
an official alone to decide whether or not to pay it. This tax 
is paid in the entire "chain." One can receive compensation 
from the budget only after paying everything. This system 
forces one to pay. 
  [Grineviciute] Recently, S. Urniezius, "Duke Vilgaudas of 
the Gediminaiciai" [leader of young people's patriotic 
organization bearing the name of Lithuania's 13th-century Grand 
Duke Gediminas], announced his plans to sell cheap alcohol. In 
the opinion of experts, only contraband liquor could be so 
cheap. How will you force Mr. Urniezius to pay taxes? 
  [Slezevicius] Measures that we are introducing now are 
directed against such citizens as S. Urniezius -- he seems to 
represent a noble family, but his actions can hardly be called 
noble. He is trying to sell and promote contraband goods. This 
demoralizes the community. We are preparing to toughen the 
rules for applying excise bands. This will be done not at 
customs warehouses, where one has the chance of leaving transit 
goods illegally in our country, but at the producer's place. 
When goods are imported to Lithuania, it must be clear where 
they will be sold. We will apply the same requirements to local 
producers. For example, "Philip Morris" exports production and 
does not pay us any taxes, but its products "settle down" here. 
We must look for an antidote! True, those who do not pay taxes 
are looking for an "antidote" against them. 
  [Grineviciute] What is a VAT antidote? 
  [Slezevicius] Such recommendations are not my function. Let 
us not discuss issues that are not the matter of our discussion. 
Laws are binding on everyone. 
  [Grineviciute] Will the increased rate of inflation due to 
the VAT require an adjustment in the litas-dollar exchange rate? 
  [Slezevicius] The increased rate of inflation is estimated 
at 
10 percent. We hope to compensate it by raising people's wages 
and pensions. 
  [Grineviciute] In this case, however, the fixed exchange 
rate 
will be unreal. 
  [Slezevicius] There is a lot of mismanagement in production. 
The consumption of energy and resources is overly large, and 
technologies are imperfect (therefore, production costs are so 
high). The difference in the level of inflation should be 
offset by increased effectiveness of production. These reserves 
will last us for a long time, and we will not have to talk about 
the devaluation of the litas. 
  [Grineviciute] Recently, the government cancelled the 
payment 
of debts and taxes for a number of state-run enterprises. How 
long will our state budget be used for the artificial sustenance 
of bankrupt enterprises and reduction of unemployment? 
  [Slezevicius] Those enterprises were not exempt from taxes. 
We wanted to separate the moribund ones from those which have 
some chances of survival. Taxes were cancelled for the Alytus 
refrigerator plant, some electronic enterprises, the cotton 
mill, and others. These are enterprises which will survive, and 
they should not be placed in an awkward situation. 
  [Grineviciute] How should business, which cannot get loans 
or 
their guarantees, to say nothing of the cancellation of taxes, 
survive under the conditions when government support is extended 
only to state-run firms? 
  [Slezevicius] The shortage and costliness of credit 
resources 
is one of our key economic problems. The Currencies Council and 
the Law on Commercial Banks should increase possibilities to 
receive loans and reduce their prices. The government does not 
distribute credits any longer. This is accomplished through 
commercial banks. It is the latter that will decide to whom 
credits should be extended.

  [Text] Vilnius, 13 May, ELTA -- Prime Minister Adolfas 
Slezevicius met leaders of health organizations on Thursday [12 
May] and talked about threatening economic situation of 
Lithuanian health care. 
  Health Minister Jurgis Bredikis told a news conference on 
Friday that hospitals were overburdened by huge debts. Six 
million Litas are unpaid by them only for municipal services. 
  There is a great lack of medicines, equipment, dressing, 
clothes and other necessary things in hospitals. Bredikis said 
9 million Litas were still not transferred from the budget for 
the needs of the health system. 
  Bredikis also said that, because of difficult economic 
situation and before creating the medical insurance system, an 
amount of paid medical services would be increased.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian Interior Minister Romasis </F>
Vaitekunas by Nijole Versinskiene, under the "Pressing" rubric; 
place and date not given: "The Constitution Protects the 
Victim"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Versinskiene] You must 
agree that criminals become particularly impertinent if their 
crimes are not exposed, and if they go unpunished. 
  [Vaitekunas] Yes, explosions, the beginning of 
privatization, 
innovative economic changes -- all these things are interrelated 
and they manifest themselves in the criminal world in the most 
repulsive manner. When I assumed this office, my colleagues and 
I primarily stated that we could not pursue normal results 
without a normal instrument, that is, the law. This is from 
what we began. A department was set up at the ministry to 
prepare draft laws. Where did the law on preventive detention 
originate? At the ministry. Certainly, the Seimas [parliament] 
had to bring itself to adopt such an untraditional decision. 
However, we did not see a better option under the conditions of 
that time. No one proposed such an option. This played an 
important role in stabilizing the situation. We believe that the 
perspective is linked with the law, where our initiative is 
essential. 
  Certainly, our influence on the criminal situation is the 
greatest through the exposure of offenses. I suppose that it is 
the exposure of some brutal and impertinent crimes which has 
allowed us to stabilize the situation slightly and forced 
criminals to change "forms" of work. Crimes are becoming more 
intelligent... [passage omitted] 
  [Versinskiene] Let us go back to the law on preventive 
detention. How many people were detained in our country under 
this law? Are there any situations when courts send the work of 
investigators down the drain, when criminals are released from 
court rooms, or when they receive very mild punishments? 
  [Vaitekunas] We detained 270 people over the four months it 
was in effect last year, and more than 90 individuals this year. 
  I would not dare accuse courts, but the situation is hardly 
favorable. We have agreed with the prosecutor general to hold a 
coordination meeting in the near future. Courts often return 
criminal cases so as to add new facts to the investigation, 
while their motives concern the uncertainty about the 
restriction of witnesses and their evidence. Some lawyers claim 
that this restriction should be interpreted in a very specific 
manner -- the restriction of persons themselves rather than 
their evidence. What would such restriction mean then? We 
disagree with such a position. Therefore, we have already 
submitted for government's consideration and coordination a 
package of amendments to laws that would really allow to 
classify witnesses, victims, and their evidence as secret. 
Opponents say that this restricts their right to defense, that 
the defender and the accused are not allowed to familiarize 
themselves with all material, and that constitutional human 
rights are violated. Yes, this sounds nice. However, we all 
enjoy these rights. If the latter are endangered, the 
Constitution protects the victim. [passage omitted] 
  [Versinskiene] Your relations with the press are rather 
complicated. Why do journalists often fail to receive 
information from officials? 
  [Vaitekunas] The press is meant for the reader. Therefore, 
it goes without saying that it wants to provide operative 
information. We are interested in the press, because it is also 
our way of communicating with people. If an official providing 
information feels responsible and comments on an event or fact 
in line with his duties, there should not be any 
misunderstandings. I am being frank -- I have a special 
sentiment for your paper. RESPUBLIKA has been of great help for 
me not only as a human being, but also as an official in my 
difficult duties. I have already said and I can repeat again 
that RESPUBLIKA and I are on the same side of the barricade. 
However, one must always remember that all people, even 
journalists, make mistakes. Thus, one should also admit one's 
mistakes. I miss one thing in the press -- I would like to see 
not only recorded facts and superficial descriptions, but also 
more thorough analyses. Journalists are people who look to the 
perspective and who have broad views. Therefore, their 
possibilities to influence various processes are also very large. 
  [Versinskiene] My last question concerns the perspective in 
particular. There are plans to transfer border defense to your 
ministry. Are you ready for that? 
  [Vaitekunas] It is the Seimas that will adopt the final 
decision. Amendments to relevant laws have already been 
drafted. First of all, this means very considerable physical 
work for us -- the number of jobs alone in this system is 6,000. 
On the other hand, there is great responsibility. After all 
legal issues are settled, they will demand the immediate 
introduction of order on the border. However, no one can 
promise this, because it is a process rather than a one-day job. 
Nevertheless, there is no other way. We also have a virtual 
need for this. Looting, car thefts, drugs, contraband -- 
everything travels across the border. We will assume all the 
responsibility then, and there will be no one to accuse.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian Interior Minister Romasis </F>
Vaitekunas by Ceslovas Skarzinskas; place and date not given: 
"Criminals Are Becoming More Impertinent, But the Police Are Not 
Idling Around"] 
  [Excerpts] [Skarzinskas] Mr. Minister, you expressed your 
joy at the enlarged Interior Ministry collegium meeting that you 
managed to stabilize the criminal situation in Lithuania over 
the first quarter of this year. Unfortunately, a new wave of 
killing and plundering has recently engulfed the country. Why 
has this happened? 
  [Vaitekunas] The Interior Ministry collegium meeting only 
provided criminal statistics pertaining to the first quarter of 
this year. They partially reflect the general decline in crime. 
On the other hand, the exposure of crimes has improved. This 
indicator is the key one in assessing the work of criminal 
police. 
  The increasing number of grave crimes, particularly of 
premeditated murders, is cause for concern. [passage omitted] 
  [Skarzinskas] President A. Brazauskas recently issued a 
decree establishing the Coordination Committee for Crime 
Prevention, to which you also belong. I wonder what joint 
action you have taken against offenders? 
  [Vaitekunas] This is not a new institution. Back in 1993, a 
decree of the Lithuanian president established a working group 
for combating organized crime and corruption. This group was 
very active in proposing draft laws. It also assisted in 
preparing the Penal Code and the Criminal Proceedings Code, and 
revisions and amendments to the law on operative actions. 
Enlarged meetings of this group, which are also attended by the 
president of the Republic, address the most pressing issues of 
crime, the activities of law enforcement and other institutions, 
and grant specific obligations to officials and offices. In my 
opinion, this helps concentrate and coordinate actions. 
  [Skarzinskas] You said at the ministry collegium meeting 
that 
you succeeded in striking a blow to criminal groups and 
splitting their ranks. However, your opponents, including 
Seimas [parliament] Deputy Chairman E. Bickauskas, are rather 
skeptical about the criminal situation in Lithuania. How could 
you comment on your opponents' arguments? 
  [Vaitekunas] We do not work for single reports. There is the 
sole desire to stabilize crime, which is manifesting itself in 
increasingly new forms. I would say that it is incorrect to 
ignore any positive changes in our work. No one argues that we 
want to accomplish more by prompt actions. However, this is not 
production. [passage omitted] 
  [Skarzinskas] The Interior Ministry is planning to establish 
additional economic police subunits. What will be their 
specific duties? 
  [Vaitekunas] The Government of the Republic of Lithuania has 
adopted a decision to create an additional 100 jobs at the 
Interior Ministry Department for Investigating Economic Crime 
and its subdivisions in all towns and regions. Officials of 
these new subunits will specialize in the financial system and 
closely cooperate with tax inspections so as to better expose 
these crimes. The number of such crimes has increased recently. 
Our task is to enlarge the state budget through operative means. 
  [Skarzinskas] Will the legalization of firearms for 
self-defense as of 1 April really help people protect themselves 
against criminals in the slightest manner? 
  [Vaitekunas] One can only predict this. The position of the 
Interior Ministry is that we do not intend to issue mass permits 
for acquiring firearms. Life will show how much this law affects 
crime. Thus far, the number of crimes committed with firearms 
has not dropped. We draw on the experience of foreign countries 
in our activities, and we do not want to commit any grievous 
mistakes. 
  [Skarzinskas] Most of our readers are interested in the 
current number of political prisoners in Lithuania. 
  [Vaitekunas] There are three persons imprisoned for crimes 
against the state. [passage omitted] 
  [Skarzinskas] The popularity ratings of the police are the 
lowest among legal institutions. Why is the community's trust 
in the police so moderate? 
  [Vaitekunas] First of all, you are slightly incorrect. Out 
of the 10 most often rated institutions in Lithuania, the police 
occupy eighth place. These ratings also include courts, which 
rank close to us in the opinion polls. The police is trusted by 
30 percent of those polled. Why this percentage? There are 
many reasons. Our strategic goal is to seek greater trust among 
the people. This is necessary not only for us, but also for 
those who are in trouble. The police ratings primarily depend on 
the results of our work. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Ruta Skatikaite: "The Choice of the Ignalina </F>
Nuclear Station"] 
  [Text] A competition on the dismantling of the third block 
at the Ignalina nuclear power station has ended. Following its 
announcement of the competition, the nuclear station was visited 
by representatives of enterprises from Vilnius, Jonava, and 
Panevezys. Several German and Norwegian firms also expressed 
interest in this venture. Foreigners immediately refused the 
structure of the third block, because, in their opinion, its 
dismantlement would require additional government assignations. 
From among the Lithuanian enterprises, the station chose the 
trade stock company "Lina." The latter has already concluded 
agreements with construction and transportation organizations in 
Visaginas. "Lina" was not daunted by the most difficult 
condition of the competition -- to dismantle the block at its 
own cost. 
  The Ignalina nuclear power station has passed on information 
concerning the results of the competition to the government, 
which will have to decide whether or not to allow "Lina" to 
dismantle the third block.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Historical Sciences Irina Zhinkina, </F>
member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of the 
United States of America and Canada: "The Aim of the 
Maneuvering over the ABM Treaty"] 
  [Text] The Clinton administration is making increasingly 
strenuous efforts to have the provisions of the 1972 ABM Treaty 
reviewed. The intensive hearings on this problem that are being 
held in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee provide evidence 
of the fact. Recently, for example, it examined once more the 
White House's proposals to lift the restrictions on the number 
of ABM systems capable of destroying missiles with an 
operational range of up to 2,000 miles. 
  In this connection it should be noted that a law on ABM 
defense went into force in the United States back in December 
1991. It incorporated the old approaches of strategic nuclear 
deterrence and new ones which reflect the trend toward the 
regionalization of U.S. military policy. The law obliged the 
defense secretary to step up the development of theater ABM 
systems with a view to the subsequent selection of the most 
promising options for deployment in the mid-nineties, using cost 
and efficiency as the criteria. 
  The law also talks about the creation of ABM systems to 
protect the country's territory against limited ICBM strikes, 
including those resulting from accidental and unauthorized 
launches, as well as missile attacks from Third World countries. 
It should be noted in this context that under the 1972 ABM 
Treaty both the USSR and the United States are allowed to have 
only one ABM complex each -- around Moscow and at the Grand 
Forks air base respectively. Nevertheless, the U.S. ABM law 
envisages the modernization of the complex at that air base as 
an initial step in the deployment of an all-embracing ABM system 
for the continental United States in the near future. But that 
is nothing less than a clear departure from the 1972 Treaty. 
The Clinton administration has not only confirmed its readiness 
to implement these amended Reagan plans but even, by all 
accounts, intends going further in that direction. 
  Thus the law leads one to conclude that the United States is 
trying to split ABM defense into two parts and "separate" 
strategic ABM defense from theater ABM defense. It is doing 
this, on the one hand, to retain greater freedom in case Russia 
insists on the precise observance of the 1972 Treaty and returns 
to the old principle of the comprehensive examination of 
offensive and defensive arms. On the other hand, some of the 
strategic tasks formerly assigned to strategic nuclear arms are 
being "reassigned" to nonnuclear systems, which will then be 
dispersed and stationed where possible outside U.S. territory. 
And finally, while continuing the program of creating an ABM 
defense system in this new interpretation, the United States 
retains the lead in the sphere of the latest military 
technologies. 
  But why did the idea of ABM deployment not disappear into 
the 
past along with the end of the Cold War? The threat of 
communism seemed to have been "dispelled." Russia and China are 
taking the path of market reforms and the democratization of 
society, and the main U.S. adversary -- the USSR -- has 
disintegrated. Treaties on unprecedented reductions of 
strategic offensive arms have been signed. The 1994 accord on 
the mutual non-targeting of nuclear weapons against 
installations in the United States, Britain, and the CIS is 
being implemented. The nuclear weapons remaining outside 
Russia's territory are gradually being dismantled and there are 
prospects of further progress in this direction. Thus the issue 
is not solely one of communism and the "Soviet threat." 
  For the United States one problem now is how to maintain 
and expand its sphere of influence in the world and how to 
ensure the further promotion of U.S. interests and capital in 
the absence of the old consolidating factor -- the threat to the 
West from the communist camp. It is no coincidence that, with 
the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and the USSR, U.S. experts 
began trying to foist on world public opinion a new "scare" to 
the effect that Moscow could not control its own missiles and 
nuclear weapons and that they would now be sold off and 
proliferate around the world. 
  Of course, it may be conceded that these fears are to a 
certain extent justified. But that problem could have been 
settled in the process of bilateral relations without a 
clamorous worldwide propaganda campaign. You cannot help 
suspecting that this campaign has been undertaken for the 
purpose of preparing public opinion for the possible deployment 
of new U.S. arms systems, including theater ABM defense. In any 
event the Pentagon is already modernizing the ground-launched 
Patriot missile and the sea-launched Aegis missile right now for 
use against short-range missiles. Work is also in progress to 
create an ABM complex to destroy high-altitude targets or THAAD, 
as it is known. 
  A quite specific question arises here: In that event, what 
is Russia supposed to do? It must be stressed here that, 
whereas previously the USSR was still able to link the ABM 
problem to the question of reducing strategic offensive arms, 
Russia no longer has that ability now. In 1989, first E. 
Shevardnadze at the meeting in Wyoming and then M. Gorbachev in 
Malta agreed, under pressure from the Americans, to abandon the 
comprehensive examination of the problem of strategic offensive 
weapons and ABM defense. Admittedly, in the event of a 
full-scale American deployment of a strategic ABM defense system 
we can announce our withdrawal from the START treaties. But 
from the military viewpoint that will probably be too late, and 
from the political viewpoint it will not be very productive. 
  It may also be assumed that the United States will try to 
share the blame for breaching the ABM Treaty with Russia by 
offering it some participation in its own program, with 
appropriate rewards. Such attempts are already being made. 
However, let us not flatter ourselves about the results. 
Suffice it to recall how the United States treated the British 
at the dawn of the nuclear era: The Americans made use of their 
interim achievements in the creation of nuclear arms and then 
broke their promise to share the end results of that work. 
  Nevertheless, it would be wrong to think that Russian policy 
is ready to let the ABM question slide. Our country is 
conducting a fairly intensive negotiation process with the 
United States in which it is upholding the inviolability of the 
1972 ABM Treaty. Its position is also based on the opinion of 
those American politicians and specialists who believe that the 
revision of that treaty's provisions could undermine the 
international efforts to ensure the nonproliferation of 
especially dangerous types of armaments. 
  As for theater ABM defense, this problem must be resolved in 
two areas, in my view. One is to work with the United States to 
define the criteria for this type of armament and formulate them 
in, for instance, an additional protocol to the ABM Treaty. The 
other is to discuss at international level the possible 
consequences of the deployment of new U.S. regional weapons 
systems, including theater ABM defense. It probably makes sense 
to propose holding talks on these problems with those countries 
on whose territory they might appear first. Efforts must be 
made to prevent the emergence of new ABM systems -- which would 
undoubtedly provoke countries to create arms capable of 
overcoming them. In practice this will lead to a new round of 
the arms race.

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin article: "U.S. Administration's Attitude to </F>
Russia Could Change If Russian Authorities Follow Opposition's 
Foreign Policy Recipe"] 
  [Text] Washington-Moscow -- "The day when Russia joins the 
`Partnership for Peace' program will be a great day for Europe." 
Bob Graham, Democratic senator from Florida and a close friend 
of President Clinton, is convinced that Russia will continue to 
be one of the administration's main foreign policy concerns in 
the foreseeable future. 
  During a trip to Washington organized by the U.S. NATO 
mission for journalists from 22 European countries, the subject 
of Russian-U.S. relations overshadowed all other issues, with 
the sole exception of the Bosnia crisis. Officials and experts 
from the State Department, the Pentagon, the National Security 
Agency, and the Congressional Research Service made no secret of 
the fact that many points of concern to Washington have recently 
emerged in Russian policy. 
  First and foremost there is Moscow's skepticism about the 
"Partnership for Peace" program. Russia's unexpected decision 
to delay joining the "Partnership" indefinitely was a nasty 
surprise for the Americans. When nationalists and Communists in 
the Duma oppose military cooperation with the West, that 
surprises nobody, but it is quite another matter when the 
president and defense minister start adopting that stance.... 
  Washington finds the arguments put forward by Moscow against 
"Partnership" less than convincing. "Russia is demanding 
special status in relations with NATO. But it will have such a 
status," was the assurance given by a high-ranking Pentagon 
official who was speaking to journalists, like most officials, 
anonymously. "Perhaps not everyone in Moscow realizes that 
`Partnership for Peace' is actually not one partnership but 
many. Each side implements its own cooperation 
program with NATO. When Russian colleagues tell me that they do 
not want to be playing the same role as Albania, I say: `Look 
at the map. Yours is a huge country with a very powerful army, 
you are a nuclear power. Who would think of comparing you with 
Albania?' Naturally, we will have an entirely special 
relationship with Russia -- a closer and a detailed 
relationship. I see no serious reason why Russia should 
renounce participation in `Partnership' and deliberately condemn 
itself to isolation." 
  In the Americans' opinion, Moscow's vacillation over both 
cooperation with NATO and the much-troubled Russian-U.S. joint 
maneuvers is due to domestic factors. Following the reformers' 
failure in the December elections, Yeltsin has changed the 
emphasis in foreign policy, espousing some of the opposition's 
ideas. These include -- however unpalatable it may be for 
Washington to recognize it -- the arbitrary anti-Americanism of 
the Russian "patriots." 
  Researchers from the "security policy research center," who 
regularly send reports to the White House, Congress, and the 
State Department, are convinced that since December the Russian 
authorities have lost their reformist potential, that a rapid 
retreat into the past has begun, and that the world is on the 
threshold of a new era of confrontation between Washington and 
Moscow. Frank Gaffney, one of the center's leading experts, 
believes that it would be a mistake to involve Russia in 
"Partnership for Peace" and that the program in general is of no 
value to the West -- the functions of restraining Russian 
expansionism could be successfully handled by NATO. Former 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former National Security 
Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski are of a similar opinion. 
  The White House is in no hurry to follow their 
recommendations. Washington's policy toward Moscow is 
determined to a considerable extent by Strobe Talbott, deputy 
secretary of state, who is a Yeltsin supporter and believes that 
Russian reform will succeed. It is premature to talk about a 
revision of the U.S. approach to Russia. In the opinion of most 
of the specialists to whom I talked during the trip, the Clinton 
administration has staked too much on Yeltsin to suddenly 
deprive him of support and recognize that the tone in Russia is 
now set by the nationalists rather than the democrats. "We are 
proceeding on the basis that the Russian Government is keeping 
faith with the reform policy, does not plan to implement an 
imperial policy toward its neighbors, and is geared to 
cooperation with the United States," a high-ranking State 
Department official stated. 
  Concern over Russia's relations with the other republics of 
the former USSR was repeatedly evident during my meetings with 
U.S. officials. They clearly indicated that, if Yeltsin and his 
entourage follow the hard-line opposition's recipe in their 
foreign policy (above all in resolving territorial disputes with 
neighbors), the Clinton administration's approach to Russia 
could change. The Americans consider the Kremlin's increasing 
pressure on the Baltic states and the troop withdrawal delay 
unacceptable, and, in the event of any infringement of Ukraine's 
territorial integrity, Senator Graham has promised to employ 
"effective economic and political measures." 
  But as far as the stepping up of the Kremlin's role in the 
Transcaucasus and Central Asia is concerned, none of the people 
I spoke to condemned Moscow -- as if tacitly admitting that the 
states which have taken shape there form part of its sphere of 
special interest. No longer seeing Russia as the strategic 
enemy of the United States, U.S. diplomats clearly prefer 
Moscow's influence in these explosive regions to be strengthened 
in preference to that of fundamentalist Iran or other Islamic 
states.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 May -- During the address to NATO leaders 
and to the heads of the bloc countries' military departments, 
which is planned in Brussels for 24 May, Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev will put forward the main tenets of 
Russia's military doctrine and proposals for the Partnership for 
Peace program. Grachev told this to journalists today after his 
meeting with the leaders of the military departments of 
Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh. "I am ready to 
answer any question so that nobody has any doubts about anything 
after this meeting," Pavel Grachev stated. 
  As far as the Partnership for Peace program is concerned, 
Pavel Grachev and U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry will hold 
another telephone conversation on this at 1915 this evening. 
  The Russian minister said that he does not intend to submit 
an alternative to the Partnership for Peace program in Brussels, 
rather its Russian version. "We are nontheless still a 
superpower," Pavel Grachev stated, "and it is not quite right to 
put us on the same level as other states, we have to be reckoned 
with. We should have our own view of partnership."

  [Text] Beijing, 14 May -- The first official visit to China 
by a Russian Federation legislative body--the Russian State 
Duma--is under way. Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian Duma, 
is heading the visit. The Russian delegation arrived in Beijing 
at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress. The visit is being carried out within the 
framework of the accords on the development of all-round ties 
between the two neighboring states--reached during the visit to 
China by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin in December 
1992. 
  In an interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent at Shoudu 
airport, Rybkin said: "The purpose of the visit by the 
delegation from the State Duma is to promote the development of 
good relations at the executive level, as well as to promote 
legislative authority in the two great neighbors. Everything 
must be done to strengthen constructive cooperation between the 
State Duma and the Federation Council of Russia and the National 
People's Congress. There is enormous potential for cooperation 
between the two friendly states." 
  The representative delegation of the State Duma will hold 
talks with (?Qiao Shi), chairman of the Standing Committee of 
the National People's Congress, and will familiarize itself with 
the law-making work of the PRC's supreme body of state authority 
in conditions of the transition to the market, while Chinese 
economic reform is in progress. 
  It is expected that the Russian delegation, the members of 
which include representatives of practically all parliamentary 
factions, will be received by President Jiang Zemin and Li 
(?Lanquing), deputy premier of the PRC State Council. 
  The delegation is scheduled to make a trip to Shanghai, as 
well as to the special economic zone at Shenzhen, in southern 
China. That is the site of an experimental laboratory for 
Chinese reforms and the policy of openness. The itinerary 
includes meetings and conversations with the heads of the 
national congresses of Shanghai and Shenzhen, visits to 
industrial and agricultural enterprises, trade and economic 
complexes, and familiarization with the work of the local bodies 
of state authority.

  [Text] Beijing May 14 TASS -- Russian State Duma Chairman 
Ivan Rybkin called for strengthening Russian-Chinese relations. 
  "I am confident that Russia will overcome the crisis in its 
development. Boosting interaction with China will become one of 
the factors facilitating the quest for ways to improve the 
situation in the region," Rybkin said at a meeting with Chinese 
Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi. 
  Rybkin is in China on an official visit. 
  "We are bound to live together by destiny and must 
supplement 
each other through close cooperation for our mutual benefit," 
Rybkin said. Russia is going through radical transformation and 
has serious interest in Chinese reforms, he said. 
  The Russian leadership is determined to continue "serious 
work in the interests of strengthening bilateral relations." 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit is 
viewed as part of this policy, Rybkin said. 
  Qiao Shi shared his words, adding that "China and Russia are 
neighbours. We value good neighbourly and friendly relations 
between the two countries which were not easy to establish." 
  He pointed out that China's policy aims at developing 
friendly relations with all countries, including Russia, on the 
basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence. Qiao Shi 
expressed the hope that bilateral cooperation between Russia and 
China will expand and grow. 
  Rybkin invited Qiao Shi to visit Russia. 
  He also met with Deputy Chinese Foreign Minister Tian Zenpei 
who confirmed that relations with Russia are one of the 
priorities of the Chinese foreign policy. He noted that the two 
countries have similar positions on many issues. 
  Speaking about recent hearings in the State Duma on 
Russian-Chinese relations, the Chinese diplomat said that Duma 
factions have close positions on relations with China, despite 
disagreements over other matters. 
  He said the Chinese Foreign Ministry stands for further 
development and strengthening of relations between the Russian 
and Chinese parliaments.

  [Text] Beijing May 15 TASS -- "Talks with leaders of the 
permanent committee of the Chinese Assembly of People's 
Representatives and other Chinese officials are being held in a 
businesslike atmosphere," said visiting chairman of the lower 
house of the Russian Parliament, Ivan Rybkin, in an interview 
with ITAR-TASS on Sunday. 
  According to Rybkin, Chinese representatives reiterated that 
"Russia's coordinates are of priority importance in the Chinese 
foreign policy." He pointed out that during the talks between 
the Russian parliamentary delegation and Chinese officials there 
was a broad exchange of opinions on problems of bilateral ties 
and international politics. 
  Rybkin pointed out a great role played by the State Duma in 
the formation of Russian diplomacy and the public opinion, which 
can be seen from recent parliamentary hearings on the entire 
spectrum of Russo-Chinese relations. 
  Touching upon prospects for trade and economic cooperation 
between Russia and China, Rybkin pointed out that there is a big 
potential in this sphere which was not used up. 
  "The chairman of the Chinese of the State Planning Committee 
put down in his note-book our proposal to supply Siberian goods 
to nearby Chinese areas. Russian goods are cheaper than those 
imported by China, for instance, from Canada, are no worse in 
quality and more accessible, taking into account a short 
distance between the partners," Rybkin said. 
  "I believe that a joint Russo-Chinese commission will work 
to 
mutual advantage. Russia, possessing the necessary technologies 
and highly-qualified experts, might take part in a competition 
for the construction of the hydro-power complex Sanxi on the 
Yangtze river, which is the biggest in the world. The Russian 
"Elektrosila" plant in St. Petersburg is unrivalled in this 
field," Rybkin noted. 
  Later in the day, Rybkin laid a wreath at the monument to 
people's heroes in Beijing.

  [Text] Beijing May 16 TASS -- Russian Federation State Duma 
Chairman Ivan Rybkin, who is in Beijing at the head of a 
delegation of Russian lawmakers, had a meeting today with 
Chairman of China Jiang Zemin. During the talks they exchanged 
views on a wide range of questions of bilateral relations. 
  The Chinese leader expressed confidence that the great 
people 
of Russia can overcome all their difficulties, and success 
awaits them. "There is a need of stability and concord. They 
are prerequisites of any kind of reforms," Jiang Zemin 
emphasised. 
  "I am very glad that the State Duma maintains friendly ties 
with All-China Assembly of People's Representatives. This will, 
undoubtedly, play an important role in the development of our

  The State Duma chairman conveyed greetings to the Chinese 
chairman from Russian President Boris Yeltsin and on his behalf 
reaffirmed invitation to Jiang Zemin to visit Russia. He 
expressed the hope that during his visit to Russia the Chinese 
leader will meet the State Duma deputies and tell them about the 
experience of Chinese reforms. 
  During the meeting Ivan Rybkin elaborated on work of the 
State Duma. In particular, he told that Russian lawmakers have 
already held readings on Russian-Chinese ties. "Irrespective of 
political bias, we have decided that relations with great China 
are of top priority for us," he noted.

  [Text] Beijing May 16 TASS -- The Russian State Duma views 
China as a priority for both political and economic cooperation, 
according to Speaker Ivan Rybkin who added that Beijing should 
not be concerned by Russian plans to join the NATO "Partnership 
for Peace" programme. 
  "With all the contradicting views and political sympathies 
of 
Duma factions we have agreed that the Chinese direction in 
foreign policy and foreign trade is a priority", Rybkin told a 
press conference on Monday. 
  He added that trade turnover between the two countries went 
up by 30 per cent in 1993 and that Russia enjoys a three-billion 
dollar favourable balance in it. 
  During talks in Beijing the Russian delegation offered 
concrete cooperation projects which can be supported by the 
governments and parliaments, according to Rybkin. He stressed 
that Russia is proposing to China unique technologies which "are 
very important for solving the burning economic problems of 
China". 
  "Russia's joining `Partnership for Peace' plan should not 
cause concern of the great eastern neighbour" as Russian armed 
forces would remain independent anyway. Russia wants to 
"preserve the originality of its army, both in armaments and the 
organisational structure. Thus we shall preserve the 
independence of the army which is not the last in the world", 
the speaker said. 
  Speaking about the health of Boris Yeltsin, Rybkin said that 
at his nearly 50 years of age he envies the fitness of the 
president who is 63. "He feels well, has a strong handshake, 
good logics and an intensive work schedule", the speaker added.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Andrey Kirillov and Aleksandr </F>
Romanov] 
  [Text] Moscow May 16 ITAR-TASS -- The year of "shuttle 
trading" between Russia and China is not yet over but its end is 
in sight, a Chinese Embassy official told ITAR-TASS. 
  The official, Ho Chushen, said the future belonged to major 
trade and industrial associations capable of ensuring 
high-quality deliveries. The Chinese diplomat said there was no 
ground behind allegations that China is implementing 
"expansionist plans" in Russia through its numerous individual 
traders. "We are striving exclusively for the development of 
trade and to our mind there is nothing bad about it," he said. 
  Trade between Russia and China amounted to 5.6 billion 
dollars in 1992 and rose to 7.68 billion dollars in 1993. This 
growth can be accounted for by the complementary character of 
the two countries' economy, Ho Chushen said. The Chinese 
leadership considers the Russian direction a priority one and 
China imposes practically no restrictions on export-import 
operations with Russian partners. 
  "The Russians are hardly likely to find a more capacious 
market for their goods than China," Ho Chushen said. 
  Chinese modifications of the Russian airliners and transport 
aircraft, the Il's, the Tu's and the yak's, are in high demand 
in present-day China, as are Kamaz trucks, Lada cars, steel and 
timber. 
  Russia is now delivering 12 power units for Chinese thermal 
power stations with a total capacity of 5.4 million kilowatt, 
worth 1.8 billion dollars. Work continues on designing and 
building a nuclear power station in northern China with Russian 
assistance, although some financial questions have yet to be 
resolved. 
  The Chinese diplomat said it was expedient for Russia to 
adopt a law on investments to stimulate the establishment of 
joint Russian- Chinese ventures, particularly in the production 
sphere. 
  Barter trade is being replaced with trade for hard currency, 
which both countries consider to be more promising. Last year 
it reached between 30 and 50 per cent of the total bilateral 
commodity exchange. 
  Although favourable tendencies prevail in the 
Russian-Chinese 
commercial relations on the whole, the volume of trade 
diminished by half in the first two months of this year as 
compared with the same period last year. According to Chinese 
specialists, this is partially due to the delay in the signing 
of the intergovernmental agreement on mandatory deliveries of 
goods, the growth of Russian customs duties and the expansion of 
licensing of export commodities. One of the main reasons for the 
reduction is a tougher approach to the issue of visas in both 
countries. There have been failures in the execution of 
contract obligations by both sides. 
  Ho Chushen thinks it necessary to involve banks and 
insurance 
companies in Sino-Russian trade relations to provide necessary 
guarantees of commercial operations. 
  China is concerned about the problem of ownership in Russia, 
where the Chinese, as well as other foreigners, are hard put to 
understand who owns what and who is responsible for what. In a 
broader context this question relates to the country's social 
and political stability. 
  China and Russia do not have open political contradictions, 
like those which complicate China's trade with Western 
countries. The main problems for the two countries are 
transportation and finances. Another acute problem is security 
of railway haulage. 
  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's forthcoming 
visit to China this month and China's Chairman Jiang Zemin's 
visit to Russia scheduled for the third quarter of this year 
will undoubtedly facilitate the development of mutually 
beneficial trade and economic relations, Ho Chushen said. 
According to experts, the value of bilateral trade is likely to 
exceed 11 billion dollars by the end of the century.

  [Text] Beijing May 16 TASS -- The respectable Grand Hotel 
in the very heart of the Chinese capital was for the past three 
days the residence of chairman of the State Duma [Ivan Rybkin], 
who is leading a Russian parliamentary delegation on its 
official visit to China. The delegation includes the leaders of 
many committees of the lower chamber of the Russian Federal 
Assembly. This enabled the delegation to discuss the most 
important aspects of Russian-Chinese with their counterparts in 
this country. [sentence as received] They met chairman Jiang 
Zemin, chief of the Chinese parliament Xiao Shi and other 
Chinese leaders. Both sides spoke out in favour of a consistent 
development of the Sino-Russian interaction along all lines 
including trade, economic, cultural, military and technical 
cooperation. 
  According to Jiang Zemin, friendly ties between the Chinese 
parliament and the Russian State Duma will surely play an 
important role in the further expansion of goodneighbourly 
relations. 
  The leader of the Russian delegation conveyed President 
Boris 
Yeltsin's greeting to the Chinese chairman and confirmed the 
invitation to visit Russia. 
  In briefing the Chinese leader on the parliamentary hearings 
concerning relations between the Russian Federation and the 
Chinese People's Republic he stressed that the Russian 
parliamentarians were convinced that relations between Russia 
and great China are a high priority for the Russian Federation. 
  Upon completing the Beijing part of the visit's programme, 
the delegation from the Russian State Duma left for Shanghai on 
Monday afternoon. In the country's largest industrial centre 
the Russian will look into reforms at state enterprises and 
study the experience of attracting foreign capital to major 
projects.

<F P=106> ["Short commentary" by station observer Mulatov; from the </F>
"Half an Hour With Wang Xiao" program] 
  [Text] Listener friends: A Russian parliamentary 
delegation, led by State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin, is continuing 
its visit to China. The Russian lawmakers met and held talks 
with their Chinese counterparts in Beijing. The delegation will 
also visit Shanghai and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. 
Here is a short commentary by station observer Mulatov: 
  The Russian parliamentary delegation's visit to China is yet 
another step toward expanding good-neighborly cooperation 
between the two countries. Actively strengthening contacts 
between the two parliaments is part of the constructive 
partnership between Russia and China. Foreign observers have 
noted that the parliamentary delegation's visit to China 
precedes the official visit by a delegation headed by Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin. The Russian prime minister will visit 
China from 26-29 May. During the visit, some documents on 
expanding concrete areas of Russian-Chinese cooperation will be 
signed. A second Russia-China summit will be held later on, 
probably in late summer or early autumn. The first summit was 
held in December 1992, when President Yeltsin paid an official 
visit to China. This time, Chinese President Jiang Zemin will 
reciprocate the visit. Holding a second Russia-China summit 
will promote and raise to a new high the constructive 
partnership between Russia and China. 
  The development of Russian-Chinese relations on the basis of 
good-neighborly and wide-ranging cooperation has gradually 
become an important positive factor that has a bearing on the 
international situation, in the Asia-Pacific region, and in the 
world at large. 
  In conclusion, Station observer Mulatov says: To Russia, 
which is a large Eurasian country, its equality-based 
partnership with China is of great importance as is its new 
relationship with West Europe and the United States.

  [Text] Beijing -- Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's 
trip to Beijing, scheduled for late May, crowns the "Russian 
spring" in the Celestial Empire, which has seen a series of 
visits from high-ranking guests from Moscow. 
  It started with Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Army 
General 
Staff. He was followed to Beijing by State Duma Chairman Ivan 
Rybkin, Deputy Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, and, finally, the 
premier himself. In the opinion of a number of Chinese 
observers, such a rapid expansion in mutual contacts shows that 
a "new old love" has bloomed again between Moscow and Beijing. 
Admittedly, the Beijing newspaper BEIJING QINNIAN RIBAO 
provided a more prosaic explanation for Moscow's intentions. It 
claims that, not having received the loans it was promised, 
Russia is disenchanted with its Western partners and is now 
banking on restoring its traditional ties with the East. 
  What do official Chinese circles think? A prominent Foreign 
Ministry official diplomatically replied that he saw no shifts 
in Russia's foreign policy. Talking about Russo-Chinese 
relations, he did not refer to love or even friendship, but 
talked about mutual interest -- primarily in the sphere of 
economic cooperation. 
  Until this year trade between our countries had been rising 
rapidly. Then suddenly, in the first quarter of 1994, the 
volume of reciprocal shipments fell by 40 percent. 
  The leadership of Heilongjiang Province, which borders 
Russia, attributes the slump to the fact that Moscow introduced 
visa restrictions on Chinese "shuttles" and businessmen. But 
our trade experts believe that the roots of the crisis go deeper 
than that. The PRC authorities, striving to curb inflation, are 
currently holding back the growth of capital investment -- 
particularly in construction. And this, in turn, has led to a 
fall in demand for some of our traditional exports -- metals, 
timber, and machinery. Russian exports are becoming less 
competitive on the Chinese market as a result of rising prices 
for raw materials and transportation. 
  Relations between neighbors may also be complicated by 
differences about who owns what islands in the Amur and Argun 
Rivers. Judging by the statement from the head of the 
Khabarovsk Kray Administration printed in the Moscow newspaper 
SEGODNYA, five Chinese warships attempted to penetrate the 
border 40 km from Khabarovsk. Our border guards prevented this 
from happening. Weapons were not used. 
  But, according to information received by IZVESTIYA from 
Khabarovsk, there were no "five warships." The border guards 
merely recorded a violation of sailing regulations by a single 
Chinese cutter, and, according to them, such incidents often 
occur, but do not constitute military provocations. As the 
aforementioned PRC Foreign Ministry staffer put it, what 
occurred were "not clashes, but disputes." 
  Disputes arise because the 1991 border agreement states that 
sailing regulations along the Amur and Ussuri Rivers will be 
further elaborated. But they do not yet exist. The Chinese are 
insisting that their ships are entitled to sail down the main 
channel of the river -- that is, between the center of 
Khabarovsk and Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarov Islands. But 
the Russian side is trying to prove that since the two islands, 
which are part of the city, are our territory, Chinese ships 
sailing through this stretch of the river are obliged to observe 
the regulations existing in Russia's internal waters. 
  Whatever happens, we should not whip up feelings over these 
incidents, much less call for the denunciation of the 1991 
agreement -- as certain politicians in Khabarovsk are doing. 
The stability of our Far Eastern borders, which was achieved 
after long, hard negotiations with the PRC, is at stake.

<F P=106> [From the "Half an Hour With Wang Xiao" program] </F>
  [Text] The value of trade between Russia and China reached 
$7.7 billion last year, an alltime high. Border trade accounted 
for almost half of the total amount. Heilongjiang Province is 
Russia's major Chinese trading partner. It is no accident that 
Heilongjiang ranks top in Sino-Russian trade because, of all 
China's northeast provinces, Heilongjiang shares the longest 
common border of over 3,000 km with Russia. Some 20 trading 
points along the border serve passenger and commodity transport. 
In addition to road and rail transport, there are direct 
shipping and air services between Russia and Heilongjiang. One 
characteristic marks Heilongjiang's trade with Russia, that is, 
Heilongjiang, taking advantage of its geographical position, 
serves as a trade intermediary between Russia and more developed 
provinces in east and southeast China. Therefore, the structure 
and nature of Heilongjiang's external trade reflect an overview 
of Russian-Chinese trade. Barter trade remains the main form of 
trade between Russia and Heilongjiang. Although both sides 
strive to diversify trade operations and to improve account 
settlement systems, barter trade still accounts for nearly 
two-thirds of the total trade volume. Both the export trade 
structure of Russia and China have undergone great changes. 
Russia has reduced the amount of raw material sold to China and 
increased industrial equipment, automobiles, and aviation 
technology exports. At present, machinery equipment exports 
account for 80 percent of Russian exports to China. China has 
also reduced exports of shoes and garments to Russia, and 
increased foodstuff supply. In recent years, border trade has 
shown an upward movement in terms of both quantity and quality. 
However, this year's prospects do not look good. Border trade 
was down by nearly half in the first quarter of this year from 
the same period last year. Was it just temporary or will the 
trend become a pattern? Heilongjiang's Vice Governor Wang 
Zongzhan analyzed the situation when interviewed by station 
reporter Mazhinkov. 
  [Beging Wang Zongzhan recording] We attach great importance 
to developing Sino-Russian border trade. Trade relationships 
between China and Russia have developed rapidly in recent years. 
The trade figures between Heilongjiang and Russia in the last 
three years were as follows: The trade amount in 1991 was one 
billion Swiss francs; in 1992, two billion Swiss francs; and 
1993, nearly 3 billion Swiss francs. Trade volume dropped 
sharply in the first quarter. The main reason was Russia's 
implementation of a visa system [words indistinct]. Complex 
procedures and lots of requirements to get a visa as well as low 
efficiency in visa issuance have dampened the enthusiasm of 
Chinese businessmen doing business in Russia [words indistinct]. 
We call on the Russian Government to adopt a policy of 
encouragement so as to facilitate [words indistinct] because the 
development of [word indistinct] is in accord with the interests 
of the two countries, and the two peoples. The development of 
Sino-Russian border trade in recent years has greatly 
contributed to the harmony, stability, and to the growth of the 
two countries' economies. Both sides need to work out 
preferential policies to solve such problems as the method of 
account settlement, prices, and tariffs. [end recording]

Another Path Will Link Russia and China"] 
  [Text] Chita -- A new interstate railroad will link Russia 
and China: 410 km of track will run from the city of Zabaykalsk 
to Irsha Station. A treaty has been signed by Chita Oblast 
Administration and the Manchurian Government. Both sides are 
very keen for tracklaying equipment to traverse the local 
steppes as quickly as possible. The point is that the existing 
"rail-link" is overloaded at this section, and at times up to 
7,000 railcars accumulate on the border. Our foreign trade 
vector is shifting ever more toward the East, Aleksandr 
Dovgyallo, chief of the Transbaykal Railroad, believes.

  [Text] Vladivostok May 17 -- Three Chinese warships arrived 
for a friendly visit to the port of Vladivostok under the flag 
of the Chinese Northern Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Wan Jin. 
  The group comprises missile command ship "Zhuhai", another 
missile command ship "Huainan" and rescuer "Changxingdao". 
  At the approach to Vladivostok, the Chinese ships were met 
by 
three Pacific Fleet ships -- the big anti-submarine ship 
"Admiral Vinogradov", the big anti-submarine ship 
"Petropavlovsk" and cruiser "Bystry". 
  A guard of honour was mustered on the pier. Pacific Fleet 
Acting Commander Vice Admiral Igor Khmelnov and Chinese Vice 
Admiral Wan Jin exchanged greetings and the two national anthems 
were played. Both sides expressed the hope that friendly ties 
between Russian and Chinese seamen will strengthen and develop 
and cooperation in the military field will continue thanks to 
mutual familiarisation with each other's achievements in 
military theory and technology, organisation of command of naval 
forces and means. 
  The Chinese sailors are touring the city's landmarks and 
memorial places. They will leave Vladivostok on May 20.

  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Russia plans to send 
2,500-3,000 peace keepers to the area of the Georgian-Abkhazian 
conflict to implement the agreement on ceasefire and 
disengagement of forces in Abkhazia, which was signed on May 13, 
Russian Deputy Defence Minister Gyorgiy Kondratyev told 
journalists here on Tuesday. 
  The general participates in the talks between the defence 
ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh in Moscow. 
  The draft document on dispatching of Russian peace keepers 
to 
Abkhazia was submitted to President Boris Yeltsin for approval. 
  The deputy defence minister noted that the peace-keeping 
force will be stationed in the security zone along the Inguri 
river as well as in the Galskiy district and the Kodorskoye 
Gorge to control the ceasefire and assist the return of refugees 
and displaced persons. 
  Kondratyev claimed that differences in the Georgian 
parliament will not interfere with the implementation of the 
agreement signed in Moscow. "Wisdom should subdue ambitions. 
The present situation in Georgia is less advantageous than that 
in Abkhazia. Therefore, its leadership should make some 
concessions," the general said. 
  According to the Moscow agreement, apart from disengagement 
of the sides along the Inguri river, the Georgian side is to 
withdraw its troops to places of their deployment outside 
Abkhazia from the Kodorskoye Gorge under the control of a 
peace-keeping force from the Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CIS) and U.N. observers. 
  At the same time, all voluntary detachments which arrived 
from outside Abkhazia, should be disbanded and withdrawn. 
  The sides requested the Council of the heads of CIS member 
states to take a decision on the use of collective peace keepers 
in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. 
  ITAR-TASS learnt at the press service of the Georgian 
Embassy 
in Moscow that it is highly probable that peace keepers will 
enter the conflict zone on June 1. The process of disengagement 
is to be completed no longer than within ten days from the time 
of its beginning.

  [Text] There is again hope of settling the Karabakh 
conflict. On Monday talks were held between Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
and Nagorno-Karabakh with Russia's mediation. Marina Chernukha 
reports: 
  [Chernukha] Open talks were held at the Russian Defense 
Ministry. Pavel Grachev insisted on it, in order that, as he 
put it, journalists could decide for themselves who is 
interested in settling the conflict and who is not. Probably, 
this had an affect as the sides agreed on a cease-fire already 
from the night of 16-17 May. An interstate group of experts 
will be working in Moscow throughout this night so that on 
Tuesday the leaders of the delegations could sign a protocol on 
a cease-fire and on settling the conflict. After this, as 
Grachev reported, on 19 May the protocol will be handed over to 
the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan for coordination and to 
the Russian president for his approval. Taking into account 
that this is the third attempt to settle the conflict with 
Russia's mediation, many people expressed doubts regarding its 
success. What is needed for it? 
  After the talks we posed this question to Pavel Grachev: 
  [Begin Grachev recording] Desire has to come from both 
sides, 
not from the people, but from the leaders of both sides. I hope 
there will be peace. Evidently it is the people who will not 
allow fighting. Enough is enough. At this time, in such a part 
of the world...you understand that when something is not working 
out and after a truce fighting flares up afresh, then somebody 
has a wish for and profits from this fighting. But remember 
that those who issue commands regarding military actions, they 
never take part in a war, they won't even go to the frontline. 
They always issue commands from the rear. [end recording] 
  [Chernukha] Well, probably this time the politicians will 
act 
more carefully.

  [Excerpts] Moscow, 17 May -- "The problem of 
Nagorno-Karabakh is unlikely to be resolved if the leaders of 
the conflicting sides do not have the political will," a 
high-ranking Russian Foreign Ministry official told ITAR-TASS 
today. [passage omitted] 
  ITAR-TASS has learned that the talks between the Azerbaijani 
and Armenian defense ministers and the commander of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh army of self-defense forces, which began on 16 
May, were resumed at 1000 this morning at the Russian Defense 
Ministry. 
  Experts were instructed last night to finalize the final 
document on a cease-fire and disengagement of the sides as the 
first stage in the settlement of the Karabakh conflict and 
prepare it for signing. 
  However, according to reports from Stepanakert today, the 
Azerbaijani Army, despite yesterday's accord on a cease-fire 
effective 0000 on 17 May, fired mortars on Karabakh positions 
north of Mardakertskiy Rayon and on the Agdam-Askeran stretch. 
  ITAR-TASS has received no information on the situation in 
the 
conflict zone from Azerbaijani sources or on the reaction of the 
Azerbaijani leadership to yesterday's accord in Moscow.

  [Text] Belgrade, 16 May -- Following my recent meeting with 
Bosnian Premier Silajdzic and today's conversation with 
President Milosevic, I now believe that representatives of the 
Bosnian sides should within the next few days be invited to sign 
an agreement on halting hostilities. Vitaliy Churkin, the 
Russian president's special envoy, who today held a meeting with 
the president of Serbia, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent this 
in an interview today. [passage omitted] 
  The Russian deputy prime minister [Vitaliy Churkin] said 
that 
the president of Serbia is in favor of submitting issues 
relating to the future structure of Bosnia and the territorial 
demarcation for consideration by the Bosnian Serbs themselves. 
Vitaliy Churkin is of the view that "they understand that what 
they are now being offered wholly corresponds to their 
interests, and that it is unrealistic for one of the Bosnian 
sides to demand more than half the territory for themselves. In 
general, he added, percentages are no longer a subject of 
negotiations. The percentages have been designated; now it 
remains to mark these percentages on the map, and the sides will 
be assisted in this by the international contact group." 
  The problem of disengaging the sides in Brcko was also 
discussed with President Milosevic, and, as I understand it, the 
Serbian side agrees to UN peacekeeping forces being deployed in 
this region, taking account of territorial particuliarities, 
Vitaliy Churkin announced.

  [Text] Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian 
president, has arrived in Belgrade on a very brief working 
visit. After meeting Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, he 
shared his impressions with Russian journalists and gave an 
interview especially for "Vesti." 
  [Begin Churkin recording] I was sent to Belgrade and met 
President Milosevic to explain to the Serbian side the content 
of the document that was adopted on 13 May at the ministerial 
meeting in Geneva, which opens up a real opportunity for the 
completion of the political settlement of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in keeping with the interests of all sides, 
including those of the Bosnian Serbs, and, apart from anything 
else, which opens up real prospects for lifting the sanctions 
against Yugoslavia. 
  One practical result of my meeting with President Milosevic 
is that, as I was convinced, the Serbian side is ready to 
immediately sign an agreement on the cessation of hostile acts 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Pavel Vasilyev report under the "Trouble Spots" rubric: </F>
"Bosnians Offered `Territorial Compromise'"] 
  [Text] The ministerial meeting on a settlement of the 
Bosnian crisis involving Russia, the United States, and five EU 
countries ended in Geneva last weekend. On returning to Moscow 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev noted that conditions 
for a political settlement of the conflict in Bosnia had been 
created in Geneva and that the opposing sides had regarded the 
ministers' efforts with understanding. 
  "I must say that the response from both the Serb and Muslim 
leadership was pretty good," the Foreign Ministry head stated. 
"We were in contact with the prime minister of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Haris Silajdzic, during which time considerable 
scope for work on a settlement based on the adopted document 
emerged. I consider that signals of a readiness to embark on 
talks without preconditions are also forthcoming from the Serb 
side, which is very important."

<F P=106> [Report by Maksim Yusin: "New Plan for Territorial Division </F>
of Bosnia: 51-49. Will Serbs and Muslims Accept Initiative by 
Russia, United States, and European Union?"] 
  [Text] The Geneva meeting of the foreign ministers of 
Russia, the United States, and five European Union [EU] 
countries at the end of last week enabled the "great powers" to 
overcome for the first time in a long time the differences in 
their approaches to the Balkan crisis and come up with a joint 
initiative on the settlement on the conflict in Bosnia. 
  The Russian and West European diplomats' main achievement 
was 
the change in Washington's stance: Overcoming their original 
skepticism, the Americans accepted the initiative proposed by 
the EU and backed by Moscow on the division of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. In accordance with it, 49 percent of the republic's 
territory will pass to the Serbs and 51 percent to the Muslims 
and Croats. 
  The most difficult question now is how to implement the 
plan. 
Both the Serbs and the Bosnian Government have their own views 
of the territorial rearrangement of the republic, and neither 
side is in a hurry to support the "51-49 option." The leaders 
of the Muslim-Croat federation are insisting on the transfer of 
58 percent of the territory to them. As for the Serbs, at 
present they control more than 70 percent of Bosnia and, 
naturally, they do not have a burning desire to return the 
captured territory to their enemies. 
  Will Moscow, Washington, and the EU be able to make both 
sides consider their opinion? There will be no big problem with 
the Muslims and Croats, apparently. In claiming 58 percent of 
the teritory they were presumably well aware that this proposal 
would not be seriously considered either by the Serbs or by the 
international mediators. The Bosnian Government is following 
the classic rules of haggling: First name an unacceptable 
price, and then gradually lower it. 
  Unlike their enemies, the Serbs will have to make not 
imaginary but very real concessions and surrender more than 20 
percent of the territory they control. According to the Geneva 
meeting participants' plan, the compensation for this would be 
the gradual lifting of the sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia. The 
question is: Will this compensation be sufficient from the 
Serbs' viewpoint. For Slobodan Milosevic and the other Belgrade 
leaders the prospect of emerging from isolation and averting the 
looming economic catastrophe is certainly attractive. But many 
Bosnian Serb leaders are radically inclined: Radovan Karadzic's 
latest pronouncements about the unacceptability of significant 
territorial concessions do not breed optimism. 
  The Geneva talks did not clear up what is perhaps the most 
delicate aspect: Will the "great powers'" diplomatic initiative 
be backed up by military arguments in the event of either side's 
refusing to implement it. 
  The United States, Russia, and the European Union evidently 
have yet to agree on the severity of their present and future 
joint actions. If they do not do so, the "51-49" option could 
be just an empty declaration, as has happened with innumerable 
peace plans put forward by the United Nations, the CSCE, and 
international mediators in the two years of the Bosnian war.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- A statement of the Russian 
Federation Council's committee for international issues 
expressed concern over the U.S. Senate decision on unilateral 
lift of the embargo on arms delivery to Bosnia. The embargo 
introduced by the United Nations Security Council. [sentence as 
received] 
  In the opinion of the committee members, such unilateral 
measures may hamper successful implementation of the 
Russian-U.S.-European policy on Bosnia. The committee calls 
against the delivery of any arms to the conflicting sides and 
believes that suspension and further lift of sanctions against 
Yugoslavia as a result of Serb implementation of the peace plan 
would help the achievement of lasting peace in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. 
  The committee stands for comprehensive development and 
consolidation of the Russian-U.S. relations proceeding from the 
fact that Russia and the United States carry special 
responsibility for peace and stability in international 
relations and could act as guarantors in settlement of the 
Bosnian conflict. 
  The soonest termination of combat operations in 
long-suffering Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponds to the 
interests of the international community, thinks the committee. 
Arms deliveries to the conflict zone will entail the deepening 
and expansion of the conflict. 
  The committee is ready for consultations and coordinated 
actions with the U.S. Senate in solution of the Bosnian problem, 
says the statement.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Nechayev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 16 TASS -- The Duma faction of the Party 
of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES) headed by Sergey Shakhray 
protested against attempts to depict Russia as an anti-Muslim 
country, which is being done by certain mass media in connection 
with its stand in the Bosnian crisis, and warned that such an 
image threatens Russian national interests. 
  "They want to clash us with Muslim states of the CIS, with 
traditional partners in the Arab world", according to a 
statement of the PRES distributed on Monday and which also 
called on the CIS countries to promote military-political 
consolidation in order to "rule out suspicions of anti-Muslim 
moods in Russia". 
  "There is an impression that somebody wants to transform the 
local Bosnian conflict into a global contrapposition of the 
Muslim and Orthodox civilisations", according to the document. 
  The PRES accused mass media of "deliberately ignoring" the 
fact that 15 million people in Russia are Muslims and warned 
that Muslim-Orthodox conflict in Bosnia "threatens to spread to 
the Russian territory". 
  The faction said that the Russian Foreign Ministry is also 
to 
blame for the current situation in Bosnia as it "hastily 
recognised the unitarian state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, supported 
the unilateral sanctions against Yugoslavia and then actually 
untied the hands of NATO for air strikes on Serbs". 
  Russia should initiate the lifting of UN sanctions against 
Yugoslavia and at the same time insist on imposing sanctions 
against Croats and Muslims if they sabotage peaceful talks, 
according to the document. 
  The PRES supported the proposal of the Russian president to 
convene a conference on Bosnia with the participation of Russia, 
the United States, the UN and the EU [European Union], demanded 
to stop recruiting mercenaries for the warring sides and called 
on mass media to objectively cover the Bosnian conflict.

  [Text] Moscow May 16 TASS -- Russia and Argentina initialed 
the agreement on the principles of relations between the two 
countries in Moscow on Monday. 
  The agreement was initialed by Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev and his Argentinian counterpart Guido di Tella. 
They also signed a protocol on consultations and an agreement 
allowing the diplomats of the two countries to travel to and 
from Russia and Argentina without visas. 
  The signed documents are the basis and at the same time only 
the tip of the iceberg of cooperation between Russia and 
Argentina which are connected by long-standing historic ties, 
Kozyrev said. 
  Argentina is a U.N. Security Council member and its 
cooperation with Russia is not just of bilateral, but global 
importance, he added. 
  Additionally, Argentina is one of the key countries in Latin 
America and Russia is launching active work in this direction to 
expand and develop contacts with regional political and economic 
organisations, primarily the Organisation of American States. 
"Guido di Tella's visit to Moscow is a big event, a landmark not 
only in bilateral, but also Russian-Latin American relations," 
Kozyrev said. 
  The talks focused on a wide range of issues and were held in 
a business-like and friendly atmosphere. 
  The Argentinian minister said that the talks in Moscow have 
brought relations between the two countries to a new level and 
revealed the proximity in the positions of the two countries. 
This is a sign that Russia and Argentina are moving together to 
a new world order based on peace, cooperation and mutual 
respect, he said.

  [Text] The development of cooperation with Argentina is a 
"very important element of Russia's relations with Latin America 
as a whole, said the head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, 
after a meeting with the Argentinian Minister of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade, Guido Di Tella. 
  As he said, relations between the two countries "entered the 
phase of close cooperation." "Considering Argentina's weight 
and influence in Latin America, cooperation with it is very 
important to us," Kozyrev said. 
  Upon conclusion of their talks the two men signed a protocol 
on consultations between their ministries and an 
intergovernmental agreement on visa-free travel for the holders 
of diplomatic and service passports; they also initialled a 
basic political document on the fundamentals of relations 
between the Russian Federation and Argentina. "The documents we 
signed are the basis and at the same time only the tip of the 
iceberg of our close cooperation," Kozyrev said. 
  According to him, relations between Moscow and Buenos Aires 
develop not only on bilateral foundations, but also on the 
"global level." "Argentina is a key state in Latin America, and 
at the moment we are engaged in active work on that continent, 
establishing cooperation with the Organization of American 
States and with regional economic structures," Kozyrev said. 
  As he said, Russia is interested in promoting interaction 
with Buenos Aires also in the framework of the U.N., since at 
present Argentina is a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security 
Council. 
  For his part Guido Di Tella pointed out that Argentina views 
Russia as a great world power. We closely follow what happens 
in Russia, and we believe that your reforms deserve great 
respect, he said. 
  According to him, the two countries' stands on many 
international issues approximate or coincide. When discussing 
the problems of world security and the future world structure, 
we speak in one language of cooperation and mutual respect, he 
concluded. 
  As the political adviser to the head of Russian diplomacy, 
Galina Sidorova, told journalists, during the talks with his 
Argentinian counterpart Kozyrev drew his attention to the 
incident involving the Russian fishing ship Orel detained by the 
Argentinian authorities since February, 1993. 
  "Our ship was detained on the pretext that it was engaged in 
fishing in the Argentinian economic zone. We view this pretext 
as far-fetched, and hope that an acceptable solution to this 
issue will be found after all," Sidorova said.

and the return of overthrown president Jean-Bertrand Aristide to 
the country, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's information

  In his words, Russia is concerned over the military junta's 
proclamation of a member of the Haiti Supreme Court temporary 
president in evasion of constitutional procedures. 
  "The recent illicit action of the Haiti regime testifies to 
its unwillingness to listen to the insistent appeals of the 
international community for restoration of Haiti democratic 
institutes. It will make more complicated the uneasy 
achievement of political settlement in Haiti," stressed the 
Russian diplomat.

  [Text] Delhi, 16 May -- "I regard India as Russia's most 
valuable partner in arms trade," Viktor Samoylov, director 
general of Rosvooruzheniye, the state company for exports and 
imports of arms and military hardware, said in an ITAR-TASS 
interview. Today he arrived on a working visit in India to take 
part in talks with the leadership of the republic's Defense 
Ministry and the commanders in chief of the Army, the Air Force, 
and the Navy. 
  The schedule of his week-long stay also includes visits to 
the wharfs in Bombay and Goa, where patrol combat ships are 
being built for the Indian Navy with Russian assistance. He is 
to assess in detail the progress in implementing a number of 
programs connected with production under licence in India. The 
head of the state company also intends, in his own words, to 
contribute to "speeding up the Indian sides' proposals 
concerning the purchase of special equipment in Russia." 
  India is an attractive trade partner for us for many 
reasons, 
V. Samoylov said. We have been cooperating for a long time, and 
the Indian side "has always paid its bills and has often placed 
major orders in Russia, expressing interest not only in 
ready-made products but also in new technologies. Our 
partnership is equal and mutually beneficial. The main 
indicator of our relations is stability, which allows the 
Russian Federation industrial complex to feel serious support."

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Russia will give the Palestinians aid in equipping 
and, partially, training their policemen stationed in the Gaza 
Strip and in the city of Jericho. "We are resolving these 
issues in practical terms," a senior member of Russia's Foreign 
Ministry, Viktor Gogitidze, told Interfax. 
  The decision to give aid to the Palestinian police was taken 
in principle during the recent meeting between President Boris 
Yeltsin and the PLO leader, Yasir 'Arafat, in Moscow, he noted. 
"This concerns the granting of light firearms and some other 
types of equipment. Each of these types is to be endorsed by 
the Israelis," he explained. 
  When the Israelis and the Palestinians signed their 
Gaza-Jericho first agreement in Cairo, the coordinating 
committee for giving aid to the Palestinian police force, Russia 
is a member of, held a session. "We studied everything done in 
terms of giving aid to the Palestinian police force, and 
considered what else they need," he said. 
  According to Gogitidze, despite the difficulties the 
Palestinian police and security forces are ready to take the 
greater part of functions connected with maintaining law and 
order in Gaza and Jericho upon themselves. "This is 
particularly important because under agreements the withdrawal 
of Israeli troops and the process of transferring power from the 
civilian and military administration to the Palestinian 
structures in Gaza and Jericho should be concluded before the 
end of May," he said. 
  As Interfax's interviewee noted, "the process of Middle East 
settlement will depend largely on how the Israeli-Palestinian 
talks on the West Bank, that is on the autonomy as such, will 
proceed." "Gaza and Jericho will be the sample under which the 
further spread of autonomy in the West Bank will be built. The 
problem of settlements and the issues of jurisdiction, 
particularly territorial, are the most complicated, he said. 
These talks should necessarily be resumed, since the agreement 
on Gaza and Jericho is good, but it is insufficient and too 
isolated." 
  Talks in the other directions, such as Israeli-Syrian, got 
stalemated, the diplomat conceded. "On the whole the situation 
is favorable for breaking the impasse. As far as we can judge, 
the Israelis realize that Syria is a key country in the Middle 
East. Movement forward in the entire peace process is 
unthinkable without progress in the Syrian direction, he said. 
The Syrians also realize that the situation is changing for the 
better. Everything hinges on the circumstance that they expect 
the Israelis to make a clear statement as to their willingness 
to comply with Resolution No. 242 issued by the U.N. security 
Council, that is withdraw from the Golan Heights altogether."

  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- According to Vladimir 
Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council (Russian 
parliament's upper house), "most serious" sentiments prevail 
inside South-African business community, which favour further 
development of trade and economic relations with Russia. 
  He came to the conclusion after a meeting with leading 
South-African businessmen in Cape Town. The two parties 
exchanged views on prospects for building up mutually beneficial 
bilateral relations. Shumeyko led a Russian delegation invited 
to attend the inauguration of the new South-African President 
Nelson Mandela in Pretoria. 
  South-African businessmen displayed interest in broadening 
trade and economic relations with Russia, Shumeyko said in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS. There is a lot of fields for 
developing bilateral cooperation. Let us take, for instance, 
mining industry: Both Russia and South Africa extract gold, 
diamonds and rare-earth metals. 
  South Africa has a well-developed processing and packing 
industries. Bilateral cooperation in military field has good 
prospects, too, Shumeyko emphasized.

  [Text] Ukraine will join the Russian-U.S. freedom space 
station project, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov 
said. 
  Shmarov headed a delegation, which had been to the United 
States to discuss Ukraine's joining the treaty on the 
nonproliferation of nuclear technologies, the implementation of 
the START II treaty by the former Soviet Republic, and its 
cooperation with America in nuclear power engineering and 
defense convesrsion. 
  Shmarov said a joint memorandum issued during the visit and 
on the American side signed by Vice President Al Gore "offers 
Ukraine broad opportunities for research and operations in the 
field of space rockets." 
  He said a Ukrainian-U.S. statement had also been released 
reflecting all aspects of implementation of the trrilateral 
statememnt by the Russian, Ukrainian and U.S. presidents on 
Ukraine's nuclear disarmanent. Both sides expressed 
satisfaction with the progress made in the work, Shmarov said. 
  He said Ukraine wpould shortly launch construction of 
facilities to produce fuel for its nuclear power plants on the 
basis of a technology to be provided by the American company 
Westinghouse. 
  The head of Ukraine's National Space Agency, Vladimir 
Gorbulin, said at the same news conference that Kiev "will 
become an equal partner in space cooperation." He said Ukraine 
in July would send a delegation to the Unted States representing 
all sectors of the country's space industry.

  [Text] All nuclear warheads will be pulled out of Ukraine 
within three to four years, Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy 
Radetskyy told journalists in Kiev on Monday [16 May]. 
  He said the arrangements for one train with warheads takes 
about one month. As of today, Radetskyy said, three trains with 
180 nuclear warheads have been sent from Ukraine to Russia. 
"Everything is going according to schedule," Radetskyy assured 
journalists. According to information available, at the end of 
1993 Ukraine had approximately 2,000 nuclear warheads. 
  Radetskyy also said that Ukraine will be controlling the 
process of re-targeting American strategic missiles earlier 
targeted against Ukraine. With this purpose a Ukrainian 
delegation is due to visit the USA soon. 
  By 30 May the USA is to change the flight program of its 
missiles so that they are not aimed against Ukraine any more.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- The People's Movement 
of Ukraine [RUKh] circulated an appeal to the Council for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe and the UN Security Council 
  "Events that have recently taken place in the Crimean 
autonomous republic, which is an inalienable and constituent 
part of the Ukrainian state, are testimony of the real 
possibility of the region turning into a zone of permanent 
threat to peace and stability in Europe," the document says. 
The authors of the appeal note that "flagrant violations of 
Ukraine's constitution based on including on the agenda for a 
session of the Supreme Council of Crimea issues on the creation 
of Crimea's own armed forces, the introduction of dual 
citizenship, completely ignoring the interests of the indigenous 
Crimean Tatar and the Ukrainian population, and the redeployment 
of military formations from the territory of Russia to the 
Crimean peninsula, are acts aimed at violating civic peace on 
the territory of Crimea thus creating the grounds for the 
emergence of an armed conflict." 
  In RUKh's view, the situation arose as a result of direct 
and 
permanent interference by state officials of the Russian 
Federation in the affairs of a neighboring state. The Black Sea 
Fleet is being used by Russia as an instrument of forced 
pressure. 
  Vyacheslav Chornovil, who signed the appeal, stressed that 
under these conditions the "process of the further withdrawal of 
nuclear warheads from Ukraine in accordance with the trilateral 
agreement should be suspended." 
  RUKh appeals to the Council for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe and the UN Security Council since, in RUKh's view, "only 
the intervention of institutions that are called on to maintain 
security in Europe can defend peace in the region and prevent 
the creation of a new zone of international tension."

  [Text] In the near future the research and production 
association Hartron (Kharkov) will sign a contract with the 
American Westinghouse company for the production of modernized 
nuclear reactor protection systems for Ukrainian nuclear power 
stations. This was disclosed to INTERFAX-Ukraine by the 
marketing director of Hartron Alexander Bek. 
  On 17-19 May, American representatives are to visit Hartron 
to work out the details of a business plan. 
  During the visit to the U.S.A. of a Ukrainian Government 
delegation led by Vice-Premier Valeriy Shmarov an agreement was 
signed on the American government offering five million dollars 
for the project. It was the first bilateral agreement promoting 
the conversion of the Ukrainian defence industry. 
  Hartron was named by Ukraine as a leading organization for 
reconstructing control systems for nuclear power stations. It 
is known in Ukraine as an experimental producer of control 
systems used in missile and space programs. 
  According to Bek, the money offered by the American 
Government should be spent on the purchase and installment of 
new equipment, the organization of testing and the training of 
personnel. 
  Bek said that according to unwritten rules the contribution 
of Westinghouse is going to be four times greater than that of 
the American Government. 
  As its own contribution to the project Hartron is offering 
its production capacities, premises, staff and intellectual 
potential. 
  In Bek's opinion, the contract with Westinghouse should be 
long-term and not limited to this project.

  [Text] Kiev -- An agreement on the "development of military 
cooperation between Ukraine and Austria" was signed on 16 May 
during a visit to Ukraine by Austrian Defense Minister Werner 
Fasslabend. It envisages an exchange of experience in the area 
of military construction, cooperation in training special UN 
troops, and setting up information links between the two 
countries. 
  At a news conference on 16 May, Ukrainian Defense Minister 
Vitaliy Radetskyy said that "being a non-nuclear and nonaligned 
country, Austria is very close to Ukraine. But the concept of 
"neutrality" today requires clarification. In conditions of 
regional instability, noninterference in existing conflicts 
would be incomprehensible." 
  Werner Fasslabend noted that "the aim of his visit was to 
learn about Ukraine's experience in military building since the 
stability of other countries created stability in Europe."

<F P=106> [Armen Khanbabyan report in the "Armenia" column: "Yerevan </F>
Does Not Believe in the Purity of Moscow's Intentions" under 
general headline: "The Military Leaders of Baku, Yerevan, and 
Stepanakert Have Set in Motion Russia's Plan for a Karabakh 
Settlement"] 
  [Text] The past weekend has been extremely tense for 
Armenian leaders and intermediaries involved in the peacemaking 
activities around the Karabakh conflict. Ian Eliasson, head of 
the Minsk CSCE group; Vladimir Kazimirov, ambassador at large of 
the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs; James 
Collins, assistant to the U.S. Secretary of State and the State 
Department's chief coordinator on the CIS countries, have 
shuttled actively between Baku and Yerevan in an effort both to 
coordinate the sides' positions and to bring closer the 
approaches of the intermediaries themselves. Bad weather in the 
region has prevented their flying in to Stepanakert. 
  According to Vladimir Kazimirov, much has been achieved, and 
never before has peace been so close at hand as now, and today 
everything depends on the conduct of the opposing sides: "It is 
to dispel the widespread opinion that the sides in the conflict 
are incapable of achieving a cease-fire or observing it on their 
own." The Russian diplomat stated that Moscow remains committed 
to the idea of a peacemaking action with the forces of an 
international military contingent. In his opinion, subdivisions 
of neutral European countries -- Austria, Sweden and Finland -- 
could take part in the operation. On the other hand, no one has 
yet expressed such readiness. Nonetheless Vladimir Kazimirov 
believes that Russia will not agree single-handedly to disengage 
the Karabakh and Azerbaijan forces. 
  For his part Armenian presidential press secretary Levon 
Zurabyan stated that some hopes are being pinned on the 
quadripartite meeting of defense ministers in Moscow which, he 
expects, will make it possible to transform the lull into a 
stable peace. At the same time Mr. Zurabyan denied reports by 
some media that the Moscow meeting between Levon Ter-Petrosyan 
and Heydar Aliyev is already a foregone conclusion. "There is 
no specific decision on this count," the press secretary 
stressed. This was also confirmed by Vladimir Kazimirov, who 
added however that it is essential to work out a substantive, 
legally binding agreement on terminating the conflict and 
overcoming its consequences. This agreement could be signed by 
leaders of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Russia as 
an intermediary. Possibly, Kazimirov added, this document will 
be also joined by Swedish diplomats who are now presiding over 
the CSCE Minsk group. 
  Meanwhile fears are mounting in Armenia that the transition 
from war to peace will not only be very complicated but could 
also entail unwelcome implications. In particular Suren Zolyan, 
a deputy in the Armenian Supreme Soviet, said that "the 
peacekeeping troops could very easily turn into occupiers" and 
therefore it is vitally urgent to consider the limits of powers 
of both observer and disengagement units in areas of their 
disposition. Unless all the intermediaries' powers are defined 
clearly today, tomorrow any provocation will serve as cause to 
introduce these units into the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh 
proper, which could lead to a repetition of the 1920 situation. 
At that time the Russian army also entered Karabakh as a 
neutral force to reconcile the warring sides but soon 
transferred that region under Azerbaijan's control. In this 
connection there are doubts that Moscow will agree with the CSCE 
proposal whereby international observers are to monitor not so 
much the actions by sides to the conflict as the activity and 
movement of the peacekeeping forces. This leads to the 
conclusion that Russia will try to thwart the CSCE efforts and 
will start forming a CIS troop contingent (also "international" 
in name), which will naturally require some time and at best 
delay a settlement.

  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- The Russia-brokered talks on 
Nagorno-Karabakh which began in Moscow on Monday between the 
defence ministers of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh 
failed on Tuesday and the defence chief of Azerbaijan flew to 
Baku for consultations with the president. 
  The sides failed to sign the final protocol on the ceasefire 
and the disengagement of troops, Russian Deputy Defence Minister 
Georgiy Kondratyev told TASS. The major provisions of the 
document were agreed upon thanks to mediation by Russian Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev. 
  Armenian Ambassador in Russia Feliks Mamikonyan told TASS 
that Azerbaijan insisted that its territories be freed 
simultaneously with the beginning of troops disengagement. He 
added that it was that question which demanded additional 
consultations with Baku. 
  However, Kondratyev told TASS that Mamadrafi Mammadov, as it 
turned out, was not authorised to sign the final document and 
requested additional time for consultations with the president 
of Azerbaijan. 
  The embassy of Azerbaijan in Moscow confirmed that the 
republican defence minister had left for Baku, but refused to 
comment on the disagreements at the talks. 
  Kondratyev expressed hope that the protocol would be signed 
in the near future. 
  According to the Armenian ambassador, representatives of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Russia had signed the ceasefire 
and disengagement protocol.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Shapovalov report: "Peace Plan for </F>
Nagorno-Karabakh. Vladimir Kazimirov Proposes Phased Settlement 
of Conflict"] 
  [Text] The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which was never 
resolved under the Union, is our most difficult legacy. The six 
years of confrontation have accounted for around 30,000 lives. 
Hundreds of thousands of people have been turned into refugees. 
  Time has also been lost today. Literally the entire world -- 
through the efforts of representatives from Russia, the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly, the CSCE Minsk Group, and the 
United Nations -- is trying to resolve the conflict. But there 
has been little success. It is hard to change anyone's mind -- 
there is too much distrust, toughness, and hatred in the 
confrontation zone. 
  What is happening needs to be recognized in the natural, 
usual way, this ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent was told by 
Vladimir Kazimirov, official representative of the Russian 
Federation president and leader of the Russian mediation 
mission, in the realization that recognizing reality and turning 
toward peace is an exceptionally difficult process that is made 
harder -- apart from anything else -- by propaganda. 
  Russia's actions should be particularly balanced and wise -- 
and this is what it is striving for, campaigning above all to 
organize good and effective relations (this is its sole aim) 
with both Azerbaijan and Armenia. 
  There is constant advice and counsel on offer, but only 
Russia has a conceptual approach, Boris Yeltsin's representative 
believes. The essence of the Russian plan is to give preference 
to a phased settlement of the conflict without undermining the 
elaboration of package measures. We are proposing three phases, 
V. Kazimirov said, which could either be superimposed on each 
other or come one after the other. 
  Phase one includes a cease-fire, the cessation of 
hostilities, and a reliable consolidation of this state of 
affairs. Like any first step, this phase is the most difficult. 
Appeals to political, legal, moral, or any other criteria will 
be useless. All our hopes will be pinned on military-technical 
measures envisaging the suspension of hostilities, the 
observance of the cease-fire, and the disengagement of the 
forces. Implementing this will take just six days. 
  Phase two envisages the liberation of all captured 
territories (apart from Shusha and Lachin), the rapid exchange 
of prisoners and hostages, the restoration of communications, 
and the return of refugees to their homes. This phase will be 
of immense importance, in both humanitarian and psychological 
terms. All this will take 34 days. 
  Phase three will be the negotiating phase, during which the 
question of Nagorno-Karabakh's status will be examined. 
  Are the sides ready for the measures proposed by V. 
Kazimirov? The meeting in Bishkek and the talks with Armenian 
and Azerbaijani parliamentarians have shown that a number of 
politicians are hesitating when they take a closer look at 
implementing the move toward peace. And it is not hard to 
understand that. After all, peace poses a threat to the careers 
of certain political leaders. Consequently, it is of little 
concern to them if the continuation of hostilities costs 
thousands of lives. Only a full appreciation of this fact can 
make politicians ignore career considerations. Will they have 
enough sense and willpower to do so?

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Russian Army Once Again Arrives </F>
in Caucasus. First in Abkhazia, Then in Karabakh and 
Azerbaijan"] 
  [Text] Over the next few days around 5,000 Russian 
soldiers and officers from Leningrad Military District's 45th 
Motorized Rifle Division, the Volga District's 27th Motorized 
Rifle Division, and units stationed in the Moscow area will fly 
out to the Transcaucasus on a peacemaking mission in order to 
take up combat positions along the contact line between the 
Georgian and Abkhazian troops and the Nagorno-Karabakh and 
Azerbaijani troops. Your IZVESTIYA correspondent learned of 
this from a well informed Russian Defense Ministry source. 
  Bearing in mind the fact that there are already around 
25,000 
troops at Russia's military bases in Georgia and Armenia and on 
Abkhazian territory, the total grouping will be fairly 
impressive although it will not exceed the limits laid down by 
the treaty on reducing conventional arms. 
  Furthermore, 2,500-3,000 Russian "blue helmets" may turn up 
in Abkhazia far sooner than they fly to Azerbaijan. Agreement 
was reached to that effect during the Abkhazian-Georgian talks 
in Moscow 14 May. The draft of the relevant directive is 
already on the Russian president's desk and, although the 
Georgian parliament's negative reaction to this agreement is 
well known -- some deputies in Tbilisi even described it as 
"total capitulation" -- Eduard Shevardnadze's support for it is 
assured and the document is expected to be signed any day now. 
  The Russian troops are to be stationed along the Inguri 
River 
on the Abkhazian side and also in Galskiy Rayon and the Kodor 
Gorge. Many experts believe that this is the only means of first 
stopping the bloodshed in this area and creating the conditions 
for the return of refugees, who, according to various sources, 
number over 250,000. 
  The talks held at the Russian Defense Ministry on the eve of 
the publication of this edition of the newspaper involving the 
leaders of the Russian, Azerbaijani, Armenian, and 
Nagorno-Karabakh military departments were also filled with 
concern to stop the bloodshed. They were headed by Army General 
Pavel Grachev. As in recent years, the "older brother" had a 
tough, exacting discussion with his "foolish younger brothers," 
sometimes resorting to ultimatums. He even made a threat: 
Unless the sides agree right now on a cease-fire and fulfill 
the protocol signed 18 February, they can clear off home. 
  The "younger brothers" agreed submissively. The Azerbaijani 
minister's feeble attempt to link disengagement with the 
immediate liberation of the occupied territories was cut short 
by Grachev's remark that this point is already been enshrined in 
the February protocol and it is the military's task to resolve 
not political issues but issues within their direct purview. 
  The military decided on a cease-fire as of 0000 hours on 17 
May and also agreed to determine the lines of disengagement 
between the warring forces and their materiel prior to 24 May; 
moreover, the Russian minister indicated this line in advance -- 
the distance from the contact line was agreed at a symmetrical 
5-10 km. In some cases, where the neutral zone passes through 
population centers, the disengagement will be asymmetrical, the 
aim being to protect the interests of the population still 
living in these areas and not create fresh floods of refugees. 
Gen. Grachev said: "There will be no refugees wherever my 
soldiers are. I give you my guarantee of that." 
  Following the disengagement of the warring parties' forces 
and materiel 1,800 CIS soldiers and officers will be brought 
into the security zone. "The CIS is Russia," Grachev said. In 
addition, Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, leader of Russia's 
peacemaking forces and Grachev's deputy, will be given a 
reinforced motorized rifle battalion to respond immediately to 
any truce violators. Forty-nine well armed observation posts, 
including infantry fighting vehicles and tanks, will be set up 
along the border between the warring sides with the task of 
keeping the peace. 
  The Azerbaijani side's request for the Russian peacemakers 
to 
include CSCE observers won unconditional support, but it was 
agreed not to wait for them. The cost of each day of bloodshed 
is all too great. All parties pledged to pay for the Russian 
troops' presence in the conflict zone. Azerbaijan, Armenia, and 
Nagorno-Karabakh each pledged to pay 33 percent of all 
expenditure, while Russia was allocated 1 percent, although 
everyone realized that you can hardly wait for money from anyone 
and Russia will have to pay for everything. 
  Needless to say, the protocol on the introduction of troops 
into the Azerbaijani-Karabakh conflict zone, like the agreement 
to station Russian soldiers between the warring sides in Georgia 
and Abkhazia, does not resolve all the problems. Moreover, they 
even exacerbate them: The United Nations has not given Russia a 
peacemaking mandate for its army, the consent of the parliaments 
of the states involved in the conflict has not been secured, the 
Russian troops' presence on the territory of sovereign countries 
has no legal status, the presence of observation posts alone is 
still no guarantee of peace and tranquillity in the region -- 
there are all too many weapons there and all too many people 
have gotten accustomed to feeding themselves not by working but 
by war and looting -- but.... There is hope of an end to the 
large-scale bloodshed, an end to the wars in the Caucasus -- 
incidentally these wars have been going on for 130 years now, 
and that is quite some time. 
  The war-weary peoples of the Transcaucasus are still relying 
on Russia and its army. Politicians must not kill that faith.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 18 ITAR-TASS -- Negotiations in Moscow on 
the settlement of the Karabakh conflict, in which Azerbaijan, 
Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh took part, is one of the leading 
topics in today's national press in Russia. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA says the ceasefire orders issued by the 
defence ministers of the three negotiating parties mark the 
beginning of implementation in practice of the first stage of 
the process which is expected to put an end to the bloodletting 
conflict. The newspaper stresses that the agreement between the 
three caucasian parties was achieved "through the mediation of 
Russian Defence Minister, Army General Pavel Grachev". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA points out that further negotiations 
were 
regrettably disrupted by the refusal of the Azeri Defence 
Minister, Mamedrafi Mamedov to sign the document on ceasefire. 
The minister left for Baku without as much as saying goodbye. 
"Many observers believe that after the Azeri delegation refused 
to sign the Moscow accord, the Azeri leadership will continue to 
pursue the old policy and seek to rectify the situation at the 
front with the help of new offensive", the newspaper said. "The 
hope for peace in Karabakh has proved futile", the headline of 
the comment reads. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI comment on the resignation of centrist 
Sergey Shakhray as the minister of nationalities and regional 
policy and concludes that "another reshuffling is taking place 
at the top". The newspaper notes that attempts had repeatedly 
been made earlier to divorce Shakhray and "the nationality cause 
which he had espoused". The newspaper finds surprising the 
promotion to the cabinet of Nikolay Travkin, the leader of the 
Duma faction of the Democratic Russian Party. The daily 
suggests that he is likely to replace Vice-Premier Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha, "a most influential figure in the government", who 
is in charge of reforms as a whole and of agricultural sector in 
particular. 
  TRUD is baffled by the fact that Sergey Shakhray "failed to 
clear up his own understanding of the reasons behind his sacking 
and evaded direct answers to direct questions from journalists". 
TRUD concludes that "traditions seem to have remained the same 
on the Russian political olympus which existed on the Soviet 
one: The veil of secrecy guards closely whatever is happening in 
the tope echelons of power, where everything is not half so 
idyllic as Russian citizens would like to believe". 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA cites several versions of the scenario 
behind the firing of Sergey Shakhray as the minister of 
nationalities. One is that Nikolay Yegorov has been appointed 
to replace Shakhray in order "to weaken the political influence 
of Shakhray as the leader of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord (PRES). 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publish an interview with President Martti 
Ahtisaari of Finland who told a group of Russian journalists in 
the eve of his departure for Moscow that the present stage in 
relations between Russia and Finland is particularly good and 
stressed that his visit to Russia would facilitate their further 
development. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA publishes an article about President 
Boris Yeltsin by vice-president of the Russian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Valentin Feodorov, who used to 
be deputy economics minister of Russia. "This is my third 
article about Boris Yeltsin, written just as the previous ones, 
from the positions of his critically-minded supporter", Feodorov 
says. He points out that "people are unable to keep pace with 
soaring prices, they eat less and worse and die prematurely, as 
they carry the burden of the price liberation which is a 
"grandiose affair". 
  PRAVDA offers an interview with Duma Deputy Anatoliy 
Lukyanov, who declares that "the (December 1993) referendum in 
the country was illegitimate: the Constitution was supported by 
less than one-third of the voters. The rest were against the 
policy pursued by the president's team. It means that the 
Yeltsin Constitution cannot serve as the basis for advancement".

<F P=106> [Phone-in interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk </F>
by moderator Volodymyr Bodenchuk, chief editor of the MOLOD 
UKRAYINY newspaper; phone-in takes place at the newspaper's 
office in Kiev on 13 May -- recorded] 
  [Summary from poor reception] [Bodenchuk] Leonid Kravchuk 
has taken part in a similar phone-in at the newspaper's office 
before, about a year ago, and this is a continuation of those 
conversations. 
  [Caller] Is a monument to Mykhaylo Hrushevskyy, president of 
the Ukrainian People's Republic, going to be erected in Kiev, 
and if so when and where. 
  [Kravchuk] Such a monument will be erected and the plan for 
this has been elaborated. Its location has not yet been 
decided, but it is expected to be erected by 1995. 
  [Caller] Three or four years ago, when Ryzhkov was still in 
the former Union, bonds were distributed. In 1993, we should 
have received the goods from them, let us put it like that -- 
cars, refrigerators, and so on. How is this issue being 
resolved, and will it be resolved or not? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, this issue is extremely complicated for us, 
from the aspect that considerable funds are needed for this. 
But the fact remains that it should be resolved -- you remember 
that this issue has been raised two or three times at Supreme 
Council sittings. At the last Supreme Council sitting an 
instruction was issued to the executive power -- in particular 
to the Cabinet of Ministers -- to find a mechanism to compensate 
in full the debts from indexation of deposits and everything 
connected with the paying back of debts to the people. 
  There are two main proposals now: The first is to include, 
for instance, savings, property subject to privatization. There 
are other proposals too. We are currently elaborating all of 
those versions that are possible, so that they are realistic, so 
as not to simply promise something to people, as before, and 
then not to hand it over. Because, if I know today that I have 
no funds in the budget, but I tell you that I will pay back to 
you, well this will be just hot air, and there is no need to 
engage in this. We are studying the versions. But the fact 
that it should be paid back to people, and that it will be 
returned -- there can be no other talk, as they say. The talk 
can only be about how to do this most efficiently and 
realistically -- so as not to promise, but to resolve. 
  [Caller, in Russian] I am an engineer and mother of two from 
Kherson. My family is facing problems due to low earnings and 
food shortages. I had to take an extra job to make ends meet. 
How long can I hold out like this? 
  [Kravchuk, in Russian] Today no one is the enemy of his own 
people and the state and all people should support one another 
in these hard times. Today one should not engage in populism 
and make hollow promises, thus deceiving the people, because 
people will finally lose their faith in the authorities. All 
these elections will be rendered meaningless. I appreciate her 
efforts to cope with the difficulties independently and promise 
that the state will do everything possible to support the people 
who find themselves in such difficulties. 
  [Bodenchuk] There was a letter from Ivan Piven who works at 
an agricultural firm in Lvov who calls on the president of 
Ukraine to exercise all his powers to stop the political orgy 
connected with the plot of the procommunist councils. Everyone 
understands that the early election of the president and the 
election of the local bodies of power are disastrous for the 
state, which is just beginning to feel the first signs of 
stabilization. 
  [Kravchuk] One can agree with the second part of this 
proposal, this letter, that it is necessary to prepare a legal 
basis at first and then to hold elections. This is the right of 
the people and the right, after all, of the Supreme Council too, 
and the right of all to determine what system our state will be 
based upon. Whether it will be a unitarian state, or a 
federative one, as some people propose. All this is the right 
of the people, I repeat this, and not only a concrete person. 
This is a very, well, large-scale problem dealing with, 
probably, every man -- even the one who has not yet been born. 
What kind of a state will we have? We cannot solve this 
problem quickly and spontaneously. This is why I say that it is 
necessary to create a legal basis -- to determine plenary 
powers, to determine the status. 
  Some leaders at oblast level are unaware of the nature of 
their relations with the central bodies of power and have no 
plan of action. 
  If this move is not backed up with a legal basis, this can 
be 
disastrous for the state, and I agree with this. By the way, we 
also have Crimea's experience. I was talking with journalists 
today. Autonomy was granted to Crimea in 1990. Only two years 
later the law on the delimitation of plenary powers was adopted 
and over these two years Crimea has covered the distance that 
should now be backed up with a legal basis, but it is much more 
difficult to go back than to do what should be done from the 
very beginning. 
  As for stopping them, for example, only by the powers 
granted 
by the people, there are nuances here. It is necessary to act 
in compliance with the law. If every one of us starts to 
violate the law and act only by the force of 
authority...[pauses]. The authority is strong only when it is 
legitimate. If it is illegitimate, it can be strong but then it 
is not a democratic but a totalitarian authority. If I make 
this step, say, toward totalitarianism and act proceeding not 
from law but from the position of strength and fear, or 
compulsion or pressure, then this will be a return to what we 
already learned and what we had already lived through. I cannot 
fully agree with the first point, but I agree with the second 
part 100 percent. 
  [Caller] Does the president, as a presidential candidate in 
the forthcoming presidential election, have an anticrisis 
program. 
  [Kravchuk] The following should be said here: Ukraine and 
its president do have an anticrisis program. What is more, it, 
in principle, was also adopted by the Supreme Council. It 
consists of three parts. Part one is the anti-inflation program 
that was approved. Second, there is the program of concrete 
steps, and third the program that was included in the 
socioeconomic development plan and the budget. That is to say, 
all those documents represent this program. 
  What is the problem then? The problem is not the absence of 
a program but the mechanisms of its' implementation, and this is 
where we continuously stumble. We have not yet worked out the 
mechanisms that would allow us, let us say, to work effectively. 
  For example -- here is an example to make it clearer -- the 
anti-inflation program that we approved, for instance, is 
oriented toward market mechanisms, such as privatization and 
demonopolization, i.e. toward the processes that again are in 
the program. But if privatization and demonopolization progress 
today is poor for various reasons -- which I will not speak 
about now -- such as issues of communal and state ownership, and 
the laws that have been produced, which is a whole, great topic 
for a conversation and I do not want to approach it now -- if 
there is no privatization and demonopolization yet, (there can 
be no) anti-inflation program. In other words, the program is 
ahead of time and is more our wish than our possibilities. 
  It is not only the programs that are wrong. He who thinks 
that we lack a program is mistaken. We have enough programs but 
we have not got enough people capable of carrying out a program, 
and we are again short of fully developed mechanisms because of 
a lack of certain experience in carrying them out at banks, 
financial and commercial structures. 
  Yesterday, for instance, I signed a directive on Ukraine's 
holding companies. There is no law determining the principles 
that a holding company is based on. After its' finalization in 
all structures, we have, for one and a half months, been working 
with specialists in order to settle this issue of principle. 
After all, holding should become a form of joint stock 
organization [aktsionuvannya] and a form of corporatization, 
which is the shortest way to market mechanisms and market 
structures. So, however one looks at it, it should be started 
from scratch. 
  But even that is not a problem. The problem is that everyone 
should want to start, and make quick progress, which, 
unfortunately, is what is lacking. The program, however, is 
there. 
  [Caller] [question indistinct] 
  [Kravchuk] So, tell me what you would have done if you were 
me? Well, just what would you have done immediately had you 
been elected president tomorrow? What would your first steps in 
relation to Russia have been? 
  [Caller] I would have considered the example of other 
states. 
I would have considered the conduct of Estonia, for instance, 
where the president is a brave man protecting his land. He is 
not afraid of this (giant) that Russia is. 
  [Kravchuk] In this case, one cannot but be afraid -- one 
should fear no one. [sentence as heard] One should, however, 
act so that tomorrow our children will not go to war. Your 
point of view, you see, is this. Apart from Kiev, for example, 
there is also -- (I will generalize), the (eastern) part of 
Ukraine. All in all, around 9 million Russians live somewhere 
there, in the east. So, suppose we should declare today, all of 
a sudden, that we want to have nothing in common with Russia 
because it is so and so, turn our backs on Russia, if that part 
of our body could be described by that word, and go some other 
way. 
  First, what would start in Ukraine itself, is the expression 
of various points of view on this. There would then be no need 
for anyone to make peace among us as we would fall out among 
ourselves, the east with the west, the center, the east, and the 
south. So what one should do is to maintain peace. No one is 
afraid of Russia, no one wants to be under Russia, and my 
position is clear: With Russia, but not under Russia! 
  [Caller] Yet, it is time now for us to show that we do not 
just grovel to someone. 
  [Kravchuk] This is exactly what we show. But why, for 
example, have we now found ourselves in the situation where we 
have not got energy carriers or this or that? We have to 
compromise and have a flexible policy in order not to lose our 
statehood. We would always lose statehood when we would not 
compromise, when we would fall out and when we would not take 
account of real forces. It was then that we would lose our 
state. 
  We need patience. We have to compromise today in order to 
become stronger. Once we are stronger and more powerful, our 
voice will grow stronger. Now, however, screaming and having 
nothing to support us is somewhat reminiscent, you know, of 
screaming by someone who is very weak but saying: I will get 
you, I will get you, I will get you! -- yet running the other 
way. 
  Joking aside, the truth is that we cannot take the risk. We 
cannot risk our people. We cannot risk our state. We have to 
act wisely, calmly and considerately. 
  I can understand you, caller. I absolutely understand you. 
You want our Ukraine to be strong, for its voice to be heard 
worldwide. Do I not want this or does anyone else not want this? 
You want Ukraine to have prestige. Do I not want this? Maybe, 
I want it more than anything else in the world, but, trust me, I 
do know the distribution of forces and the situation, and I do 
so better than you -- no hard feelings. I do know that if I 
take a wrong step today, we will lose everything tomorrow. 
  [Caller] Well, what about Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev behaving as he pleases in our (Crimea)? 
  Kravchuk: Never mind. The main thing for us is to hold the 
fort and then we will tell him how to behave himself. 
  [Caller] The people are losing hope. Hopelessness is what is 
(frightening). 
  [Kravchuk] The people should understand -- and you must say 
this as well -- that nihilism should not be sown now. (You must 
tell them) that every time one is starting to build something, 
one should build it and then be independent. But in the 
situation where we have not yet built our state and are still 
building it, facing everyone at once and, shall we say, showing 
force, requires that force to be there. 
  In general, I am against any force. I am for living in 
peace. You can see what the show of force has led to for those 
who practiced it. They, up till now, have not been able to make 
both ends meet. Take Yugoslavia: Two million of its people are 
now living outside that country, have become refugees or are 
wandering worldwide. I have recently spoken to Azerbaijani 
President Aliyev: 200,000 people are living in tents at that end 
of the country, in Iran, Iraq, and so on. We have so far 
restrained ourselves. We are not destroying anything. We are 
in the process of building. We need patience and flexibility 
and we need to compromise -- although you are saying that this 
should be ended and so on -- in order to build it. Once we have 
built it, then the attitude toward us will change accordingly. 
Once we have had enough wisdom to build it, we will be 
respected. 
  Trust me, I have as great a desire as you do. One cannot, 
however, have a desire alone if it is not backed by any real 
possibilities. 
  [Caller] I am a correspondent from Radio Liberty's Moscow 
bureau. Our first question is on the possibility of the 
presidential election now indeed being cancelled by the current 
Supreme Council... 
  [Kravchuk, interrupts in Russian] Well, it is difficult for 
me to tell you whether it will or will not be. I have presented 
to the Supreme Council a message where, in what seemed to me to 
be a well-founded manner, I tried to explain why the election 
today -- ahead of settling all legal and other issues at 
constitutional level -- would not only be, as it were, 
undesirable for Ukraine, but might also become a danger. What 
the parliament will decide, I cannot say. The only thing I do 
know is that 120 deputies, approximately two weeks ago, backed 
this proposal. It is supported by local councils, enterprises' 
work-forces, scientists, people. In other words, this question 
is such that it should be addressed at parliamentary level and 
such a document has been sent to parliament. 
  [Caller, in Russian] My second question is this: (You know 
that) an economic agreement may be signed between Russia and 
Crimea. How do you feel about these bilateral ties between 
Russia and Crimea? 
  [Kravchuk, in Russian] Well, as for a trade and economic 
agreement, we can say that Ukraine, for example, has its own 
trade and economic relations with Tatarstan. We have also 
signed an appropriate agreement. That is why I cannot see any 
problems if the Crimean autonomous republic were to sign trade 
or other relations of an economic nature with other entities. 
  I hope you understand that it is trade and economic ties 
that 
we are talking about, provision for which was, on the whole, 
made in our documents and decisions, as it were. We are not 
talking about the conclusion of any political treaties as an 
entity of international law. That Crimea might act as an entity 
in international law is not provided for and, let us say, is 
today excluded. 
  [Caller] Here is my question. Since the Supreme Council of 
Crimea and its current leadership tend to operate a pro-Moscow 
policy rather than a pro-Kiev one, do you think the transition 
of Crimea to Russia is a possibility? How does the Russian 
leadership feel about this with regard to the international 
situation? 
  [Kravchuk] I will answer your question. The leadership of 
Russia is a broad notion, to a certain extent. There are 
executive authorities within the leadership of Russia. 
  [Caller] Yes, I have in mind the top leadership. 
  [Kravchuk] For example, the president. For example, Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin, President Yeltsin, and others. As 
official statements read, they support Ukraine's integrity and 
this is stipulated in our treaties and the trilateral agreement. 
The inviolability of borders, the integrity and sovereignty of 
Ukraine are supported by both the executive authorities in 
Russia and other states: The United States of America, France, 
Great Britain, and Germany. That is to say, we enjoy full 
international support as far as this issue is concerned. This 
is the first thing. 
  Second, it is Russia's representative structures that are 
conducting a crafty policy today. I have in mind the Russian 
Duma. Well, the Duma's deputies and others arrive and allow 
themselves to declare that Crimea is the territory of Russia, 
that it was and will belong to Russia, that the fleet belongs to 
Russia. The local authorities in Crimea also support such 
statements by these people but these are their wishes only. 
  No international agreements, no other documents or 
agreements 
between Ukraine and Russia envisage -- on the contrary they 
stipulate that Ukraine, as a state, is integral and inviolable. 
We will conduct this very policy. However, there is no doubt 
that, well, such a trend, such a stand, such a desire on the 
part of the people in Crimea does exist. To prevent this we 
must do everything possible so that life becomes better both in 
Ukraine and in Crimea. Believe me, when it becomes better, these 
issues will be relegated to the background. 
  [Caller] [passage indistinct] 
  [Kravchuk] Well, it may well be that this, let us say 
openly, 
is propaganda, because Russia cannot be assessed by what Moscow 
and St. Petersburg are like. Let them go deep into Russia and 
see for themselves what there is.... 
  [Caller, interrupts] Why take three Russian cities and say 
that Russia is better-off. 
  [Caller] Leonid Makarovych, this is [name indistinct] 
calling 
you. I am an engineer and work as deputy department head [words 
indistinct] Statistics Ministry. I do not think that 
privatization in Ukraine fully takes account of the interests of 
the Ukrainians proper. The impression is that there are no rich 
businessmen and entrepreneurs of Ukrainian nationality. The 
state does not take proper care with the participation of 
Ukrainians in business. So the question of how many Ukrainians 
of Ukrainian origin have businesses is very important. 
  Leonid Kravchuk mentioned the United States of America as 
an example of a country where business circles are represented 
by the people of various nationalities. If we approach business 
proceeding from ethnic belonging, we will not last long, believe 
me, he added. 
  The caller then referred to American Indians who, in his 
opinion, achieved more in the United States than Ukrainians in 
Ukraine. He said they concluded a treaty with the occupants, as 
he put it, in compliance with which they receive compensation 
for the use of their land to the value of $400. He then said 
that privatization in Ukraine, if carried out by all kind of 
swindlers, may affect the interests of the Ukrainian population. 
  [Kravchuk] I will take your remarks into account. But I 
would like to repeat that one should act in this case proceeding 
from the following criterion: If a person is doing something 
good to Ukraine, proper conditions should be created for this 
person. Because, excuse me for saying this, but there are such 
Ukrainians with whom I would not like to communicate and there 
are such Russians and Jews with whom I would like to sit and 
have a cup of tea. This is a normal phenomenon. 
  [Koltsov, in Russian] Good afternoon. I am Vladimir Koltsov 
of the Moscow-based radio station Yunost [youth] of the 
Ostankino Company. 
  Leonid Makarovich, I have this question: The thing is that 
yesterday the Supreme Council did not put the issue on 
postponing the early election of the president on the agenda. 
What do you intend to do next in this situation? 
  [Kravchuk] No, it seems that you are not quite precise. 
Yesterday the Supreme Council made up the agenda for three days 
only. That is to say, it put only organizational issues on the 
agenda. Namely, the election of the presidium, then the 
formation of the working bodies of the Supreme Council, that is 
the election of the chairman, deputy chairmen, and the formation 
of the committees. Today they are tackling issues connected 
with the setting up of groups and groupings, the time limit, and 
so on. That is to say, the Supreme Council did not put on the 
agenda the issues other than those dealing with the organization 
of the work of the Supreme Council itself. However, it did 
enter the issue on postponing the election in the list of issues 
to be discussed by the Supreme Council after the organizational 
issues are solved. 
  [Koltsov] But Leonid Makarovich, what do you think, in your 
view, will the deputies agree to postponing the presidential 
election, as very little time now remains until that date. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, you see, the issue here, whether little or 
much time remains, for instance, the deputies have now divided 
into two sections. Some of them are in favor of postponing the 
elections of both the president and of local bodies. The 
others, say, are in favor of only postponing the presidential 
election, but to hold elections, say, to the local bodies. 
Whether they agree or not, I understand it thus, that any 
issue, no matter whether it is resolved late or early, even if 
it is not ready, it must be resolved correctly. 
  The problem is not the time period. The problem is the 
rightness and necessity of the issue. Because, for instance, if 
one is faced with such a dilemma -- today something bad has to 
be done, it is planned to do something bad, little time remains 
to stop this bad thing, and we consciously agree to a bad step, 
for instance, being guided only by the idea that there is little 
time left. This does not happen. There is political 
advisability, need, necessity, importance, and, as one says, 
political consequences. That is the main thing. So, I have 
presented, one can say, all of the arguments to the Supreme 
Council. Their job is to decide, to decide finally, that is to 
decide. And all those, who should go to the elections, will 
decide. 
  [Koltsov] Leonid Makarovich, tell me, how do you evaluate 
the 
future of the further, let us say, dispute between Russia and 
Ukraine on the matter of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  [Kravchuk] We should resolve this issue, as, incidentally, 
the day before yesterday or thereabouts, I dispatched a letter 
to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, about us, well, on the 
whole, embarking on a continuation of these talks at a higher, 
if one can express it thus, level of representation, about us 
instructing our governments, or at the level of deputy prime 
ministers or prime ministers, to sit down and make specific 
proposals, and sign them, not passing them over to other 
authorities. Because when we assemble there, for instance, with 
the president, with the government, we resolve issues. Then we 
hand them over to authorities, ministries, departments. They 
begin to go the rounds and to wreck, as one says, these issues 
right there. Therefore, they should be resolved at a 
substantial level and submitted for signature, fundamentally--it 
seems to me--elaborated and coordinated. Now the goodwill and 
understanding of the interests of both Ukraine and Russia are 
needed. 
  [Unidentified caller] Tell me please, might one call your 
decision to stand in the presidential election on 26 June a 
final one? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, you see, I want the Supreme Council to 
examine my appeal and to decide on it. If the Supreme Council 
postpones the election, then naturally I will withdraw my 
candidacy from the voting. If the Supreme Council leaves the 
decision of the old Supreme Council in force, that is, it does 
not postpone or stop the election, that means that I will take 
part in the election like all the others. 
  [Caller] If the election nevertheless, takes place, who of 
the other contenders for the post of president do you consider 
to be your main competitor? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, it is difficult to say now. You see, the 
situation is changing. Clearly the main ones, I think, the most 
credible contenders, who have already made themselves known, 
whom Ukraine knows about and who have the right image, are Ivan 
Plyushch and Leonid Kuchma. For instance, I know that certain 
circles, certain structures and certain people have a favorable 
attitude to the young contenders too, in particular to Valeriy 
Babych and Volodymyr Lanovyy. I think that Oleksandr Moroz too, 
has some possibilities for taking an active part in the 
election, and so do others, that is Petro Talanchuk. That is, I 
would not want to belittle anyone now or to single anyone out. 
Everyone has a chance. But the voting will show who has made 
use of it. 
  [Prytula] Leonid Makarovych, this is Volodymyr Prytula, a 
journalist from the Crimea. Leonid Makarovych, at a news 
conference today Serhiy Tsekov, chairman of Crimea's Supreme 
Council, spoke in favor of Crimea forming its own National 
Guard. What is your attitude to this, and in general what 
measures will you take regarding this? 
  [Kravchuk] The Crimea is not a state; the Crimea is an 
autonomous republic, and according to Ukraine's legislation, the 
formation of its own armed forces or a guard or something else 
is not envisaged by the Crimea. 
  [Prytula] [passage indistinct] 
  [Kravchuk] No one in the Crimea will accept it, because it 
is 
not a subject of international law. 
  [Starozhytska] This is Mariya Starozhytska from the 
television news agency "Vikna" [Windows]. Yevgeniy Saburov and 
Aleksandr Shokhin are to sign an accord in the Crimea tomorrow 
[14 May] on cooperation between the Crimea and Russia. What is 
your attitude to this as president of Ukraine? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, this needs to be formulated more precisely. 
They are to sign an agreement on trade and economic cooperation. 
We have also signed, Ukraine has signed corresponding 
agreements on economic and trade cooperation between, for 
instance, Ukraine and Tatarstan. And, let us say, Russia did 
not become warm nor cold because of this, and we could work 
normally with Tatarstan. We also sign corresponding trade and 
economic agreements with other regions of Russia. And there is 
no problem, for instance, when precisely a trade and economic 
agreement between the Crimea and Russia is concluded, but this 
is not, as you say, on cooperation, partnership, or something 
else. This is not a political--not a document with the nature 
of a treaty--this an agreement on trade, on economic relations. 
This is envisaged. There is no problem with this. But if, for 
instance, it had been about a treaty between two states, if, for 
instance, Russia had signed some kind of interstate document 
with the Crimea, or military-political, or some other kind of 
document--this is impossible now, because the Crimea is not a 
subject of international law. The Crimea is an autonomy within 
the composition of Ukraine. But it can have economic relations 
with any state. 
  [Bodenchuk] Here is a question sent in by representatives of 
the U.S. magazine EASTERN ECONOMIST: The United States and other 
Western states conditioned the allocation of a certain financial 
aid to Ukraine by the implementation of economic reform. New 
economic programs should be drafted and submitted toward that 
end. If they are being drafted, who is engaged in this process? 
When and how can one expect that the implementation of this 
reform will get under way? 
  Answering this question Leonid Kravchuk said that such 
programs, although they are not perfect, do exist. He also said 
that an expert group of the International Monetary Fund is 
expected to arrive in Ukraine soon to complete the elaboration 
of Ukraine's program that may be backed up financially. The 
problem of setting up a stabilization fund may also be solved. 
  [Kravchuk] That is to say, after this visit we will be able 
to say definitely to what extent this program complies with the 
norms adopted by these international financial structures, if it 
is approved and adopted. This will mean that the green light 
will be given to investments, [word indistinct], Western 
economic aid, including [words indistinct]. However, at this 
point one should know the difference: These $700 million 
earmarked by the United States for Ukraine--$350 million for 
military and nuclear issues and $350 million in economic 
aid--are not directly linked with economic reform. Nobody means 
to say that this money will not be allocated if economic reform 
makes no progress. This is an absolutely different thing. The 
talk is about the large-scale, let us say, movement of capitals 
both along state lines, along commercial lines, along lines of 
private investments, and so on. True, this movement of capitals 
is directly linked with the progress of economic reform. 
  Well, it is worthwhile mentioning that, although with 
difficulty, but one can say definitely that this movement, as 
they say, is already carried out. Both the privatization 
program...[pauses] You, probably, write and read and see this 
yourself. They already mention specific numbers of enterprises 
that are being privatized. Preparations are under way for the 
introduction of our own currency unit the hryvna. Serious 
restructuring processes are taking place in the banking, credit, 
and financial structure. There is some stabilization today. We 
have sharply reduced inflation rate. They say this is so 
because money is not available. But one should not just receive 
money, one should earn it. 
  That is to say, the statements to the effect that the reform 
in Ukraine is at a standstill, although they have already been 
driven into people's heads, they do not correspond to reality in 
full measure. The reform is moving forward today. True, it is 
moving forward with difficulty. True, it is moving forward in a 
complicated manner. It is moving forward slowly, this is also 
true. But one should take into account our specific features. 
  [Bodenchuk, in Russian] Here is a telegram from Volonovakha, 
Donetsk Oblast: In order to coordinate further work for your 
support, please inform us urgently of a time for an appointment 
in Kiev so that we can leave immediately--the independent youth 
of the rural areas. 
  [Kravchuk] That is interesting, Ukraine's youth for the 
president. That is interesting. We should invite someone from 
the group to contact us. Well, why should they all have to come 
to Kiev. Perhaps I could go to them. 
  [Bodenchuk] Here is a telegram from Kobelyaki in Poltava 
Oblast: There is nowhere to retreat to. More political will is 
needed. We wish you success most sincerely. Ukraine is with 
you. Mykola Androfiv, Kobelyaki. 
  [Kravchuk] Great. Thank you Mykola Androfiv from Kobelyaki-- 
that is in Poltava Oblast is it not? Truly for us to retreat, 
it is not so much that there is nowhere to which to retreat, but 
it is impossible. Even if there were somewhere to retreat to, 
it would be impossible, because I tell everyone, and I have to 
say it here, you know, this is a chance that history has given 
to us to survive. And I say that there all possibilities for 
doing this, all possibilities. 
  There was a time, in November-December of last year for 
instance, when inflation reached 80 percent each month, 
incidentally this is what the previous government did, we had 
these consequences. I really thought that the economy would 
collapse if we did not get any help, there was this nuclear 
pressure, all channels were closed, we were being deprived, one 
by one they were reporting that credits were being suspended, 
and so on. This was terribly difficult, terribly difficult. 
But, now that we have gone down this road, the attitude toward 
us has changed. We have acquired some sort of experience. 
  Well, we were the first of the CIS countries, if we are to 
take the sea as an example, to feel the sand at the bottom of 
the sea. We were the first. We were the first to touch the sand 
because we were the first to endure the blow of prices for 
energy-carriers. We were the first to have, say, the fiercest 
economic sanctions applied against us, perhaps not sanctions, 
but economic levers, let us say. We have endured this. These 
prices increased by tens of thousands of times. There was 
nowhere to turn. We were at the bottom. This was sand. To go 
lower would just mean to dig ourselves into the sand, or 
possibly submerge ourselves in it. This means, that we can now 
go, and we are beginning to go along the sand, for now very 
slowly, but not downward now. 
  Perhaps we are even going up. For instance, [words 
indistinct] has increased by 12 percent compared to the 
corresponding period. There is the expectation and hope now 
that we can survive economically. If we can survive 
economically, then we will survive from the state, political, 
and spiritual aspect without fail. Those countries, who have 
not reached the sand, are currently experiencing greater blows. 
I am thinking of the Central Statistics Directorate, the press, 
contacts, for instance, with the Asian republics. They are 
still sinking for the moment. 
  Therefore, there is a chance--not just for us, but for 
everyone. If we are going to talk to one another about helping 
each other within the CIS framework, and not set some kind of 
ambitions or political aims, then we can survive and live in 
friendship and partnership with all countries and peoples. 
Naturally the will is needed, the strength is needed, support 
is needed. People have also understood much over this time. 
  When some part, say, of the political forces and their 
leaders, are widely shouting that again Ukraine will not 
survive, that it can survive only under Russia. Some say with 
Russia, but in fact it means only under Russia, because you know 
if we do not have our own banks, our own armed forces, our own 
currency, what kind of equality is this? We should just put 
this out of our mind and have done with it, because why deceive 
the people. They should say that we cannot live otherwise--we 
need someone above us--and they could just go their own way. 
Whoever wants to can go in that direction, whoever does not 
want to- well, that is the way it is. Naturally, each person 
will work it out. But there is no need to deceive the people 
because independence is independence. It cannot be that there 
is independence in just one thing--for instance, independence to 
go out onto the street in the evening. [passage indistinct] We 
can and will go out. But I would like everyone to understand 
this. I wish you all the best.

  [Excerpts] President Leonid Kravchuk was in Donetsk oblast 
on a working visit today. He was met at the airport by his 
representative Yuriy Smyrnov and by Vadym Chufrun, chairman of 
the oblast council. Leonid Makarovych stressed that the Donbass 
is a special industrial region which together with the other 
industrial oblasts of Dnepropetrovsk, Lugansk, and Zaporozhye 
defines the state of the economy in our country. 
  The president of Ukraine held talks in Yenakiyevo with the 
heads of the state administrations of these oblasts and also 
with directors of metallurgical, coke oven, and coal industries. 
First, though, the inhabitants of this town surrounded Leonid 
Makarovych. Obviously, people are primarily concerned with 
social issues: prices, wages, housing, and medicines. As the 
president noted, they may be fully resolved when our state's 
economy begins to work as it should. 
  The directors asked the president to adopt decrees that 
would 
solve the problems of credits, exports, and mutual nonpayment. 
The miners alone owe their subcontractors more than 5 trillion 
karbovantsi. Ilyushenko, director general of the Donetsk 
Vuhillya production association, said that these are the results 
of the unsuccessful actions of Kuchma's government. Hrihoriy 
Pyatachenko, Ukraine's minister of finance, and Viktor 
Yushchenko, the chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, 
explained to the directors that the present government is 
tackling precisely these problems and invited them to come to 
Kiev as a group next Monday in order to adopt a final decision 
aimed at pulling the Ukrainian economy out of the economic 
crisis. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording] Ukraine was one of the first 
countries in the CIS to suffer the biggest economic shocks, 
above all, with regard to prices of energy sources, taking into 
account the great dependency of our industrial sector on energy 
sources. At the end of 1993, as you remember, we simply had a 
terrible rate of inflation, prices increased, and everything 
negative followed from this. 
  Because of these shocks, Ukraine's economy sank very low. 
Thanks to the steps that were taken by the government, 
regardless of your criticism of it, we succeeded in holding out, 
although I should honestly tell you that in December I had some 
terrible feelings that we could lose control over the economy 
and even the situation. 
  This is not a positive aspect which one should be proud of 
but, nevertheless, we could say that Ukraine held out. And now 
we are standing on the ground. The time has come when we, 
standing here on this ground, should now start a new stage in 
our economic activity and should build a foundation on it. 
Well-considered steps and extremely radical steps are required. 
We must therefore combine considered actions with radicalism 
and executive activity, discipline, order, and organizational 
ability. [end recording]

  [Text] The Military Council of Ukraine's Naval Forces has 
expressed a strong protest against the provocative actions and 
statements by some officers and admirals of the Black Sea Fleet, 
as well as by high-ranking officials and activists of Crimean 
pro-Russian public organizations. Convinced of their impunity, 
reads the Military Council's statement disseminated on the 
occasion, individual military officials of the Black Sea Fleet 
declare increasingly aggressively about their readiness to 
violate by force the integrity of existing borders. Moreover, 
Crimean President Yu. Meshkov accuses, without any 
substantiation, the Command of Ukraine's Naval Forces of 
allegedly calling for confrontation. Ukrainian servicemen 
decisively refute such allegations and confirm their readiness 
to maintain friendly relations with the Black Sea Fleet.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Oleksandr Skipalskyy, chief of </F>
the Ukrainian Security Service Military Counterintelligence, by 
Anatoliy Ben; place and date not given: "If Not by Numerical 
Strength, Than by Skills"] 
  [Text] "We will vote for people wearing epaulets. Perhaps 
they will restore order in the country..." -- one could often 
hear such opinions during the latest election campaign, and the 
voters were doing just that. As a matter of fact, not many 
people in epaulets -- officers and generals of the Army, the 
Militia, or the Security Service -- dared to engage in the 
electoral battle. Many of those who braved the election, 
however, won an overwhelming majority of votes in the first 
round. Among them was Major General Oleksandr Skipalskyy, chief 
of the Ukrainian Security Service Military Counterintelligence. 
He does not consider himself the leader of a possible 
parliamentary faction of "people in epaulets." He believes that 
there are not enough such deputies in the new Supreme Council. 
Yet, it should not be forgotten that they are disciplined and 
mobile people, that they fight not by "numerical strength, but 
by skills," and that they do not play the least important role 
in the configuration of parliamentary forces. Such servicemen 
as O. Skipalskyy, who has gone through the mill of political 
battle and earned experience working at the Security Service, 
are not remaining in the shadows. Our correspondent began his 
interview with the following question: 
  [Ben] Oleksandr Oleksandrovych, what prompted you to trade 
in your Military Counterintelligence Service identification card 
for a seat in parliament? 
  [Skipalskyy] I and my colleagues were led to the Supreme 
Council primarily by our concern over Ukraine's political and 
economic instability. External enemies are trying to rock our 
state. This is a purposeful action, and there is a vast area of 
legislative work ahead of us, specialists who have long been 
working in law enforcement bodies, particularly, in the Security 
Service, to disarray our foes in the legislative way. 
  [Ben] I recall Suvorov's [19th century Russian commander] 
saying that "they fight not by numerical strength, but by 
skills." Nevertheless, as I believe, there are too few "people 
in epaulets" in the new parliament, and there are not many of 
your followers either. 
  [Skipalskyy] Based on the most important thing -- the 
development of the independent Ukrainian state -- I expect that 
there will be an absolute majority of my followers in the new 
Supreme Council. 
  As for my followers on issues of military policy and 
development, the situation here is more complex. Among the new 
legislators, there are really too few servicemen who have 
experience in developing a new armed forces. Parliaments of 
civilized countries comprise many military officials who have 
participated in combat operations, which guarantees that 
mistakes will be avoided while forming military policy. 
  In the current parliament, there are almost 10 people who 
wear military uniforms. I think that they will contribute to 
the development of our Armed Forces and other power structures. 
  [Ben] Could you name them? 
  [Skipalskyy] Of course. I am convinced that such deputies 
as Colonel Omelchenko and Lieutenant Colonel Yermak will do a 
lot in the parliament, and that Admiral Kozhyn will contribute 
to the development of the Ukrainian Navy. I can also name Gen. 
Chykalo, deputy chief of the Zhytomyr Corps, Lieutenant Colonel 
Bilous, and Col. Bilas. There is a large group of reserve 
officers. 
  [Ben] Are your followers planning to form a separate 
faction in parliament, or are they going to unite in some other 
way? 
  [Skipalskyy] Everything will depend on the atmosphere in the 
Supreme Council. We have discussed this issue and come to the 
conclusion that factions are useful, but if there are too many 
of them, this can trigger fierce and sometimes even useless 
discussions. We are ready to join a faction which will 
implement progressive economic reforms, and we will be 
politically sympathetic with all supporters of the development 
of our independent sovereign state -- Ukraine. 
  [Ben] In your opinion, as a serviceman, what laws must 
currently be adopted, or which laws already in force must be 
amended or altered, for a more effective military policy of our 
state and the development of its Army? 
  [Skipalskyy] Unconditionally, the most important thing today 
is a new constitution. It is absurd when a state forms its new 
political and economic platform and its fundamental law remains 
unchanged. 
  I would not like the new parliament to get excited over a 
revision of laws in force. Certain laws, however, must be 
changed or amended. We are particularly concerned over the 
"delayed action bomb" implanted by the Supreme Council to 
strengthen separatist positions in Ukraine. I have in mind the 
direct elections for new oblast council heads. Excuse me, but 
this resembles independent principalities we saw in our history. 
We know what came about then. 
  Regarding legislative acts concerning the sphere of military 
policy, certain amendments must also be made here. We have 
worked out a legislative basis, and it is in force. We must 
immediately apply measures, particularly legislative ones, to 
strengthen military discipline. Legislation on military police 
must also be adopted. We currently do not have a precisely 
defined structure which would fight against crime in the Army. 
Such legislation has already been drafted. The crime-breeding 
situation in the Army requires that we adopt this legislation 
immediately. I think that legislative acts, which regulate 
conscription of our young men into the Army, must also be 
changed. Currently, a great many conscripts are evading 
military service: Those who have money -- buy their way out; 
those who do not -- serve in the Army. I could list a whole 
range of issues that should be resolved at the parliamentary 
level. 
  [Ben] There are currently many debates concerning problems 
related to reforming the system of military education. The 
current chiefs of the military department claim that their 
predecessors, particularly Gen. Prokofyev, "messed things up," 
and that the situation requires substantial changes. I would 
like to know your opinion in this regard. 
  [Skipalskyy] My opinion is unequivocal. I was once 
supporting (and I still support) many of Gen. Prokofyev's 
innovations. At the same time, I agree with those military 
specialists who consider Prokofyev's miscalculation the fact 
that he did not establish a mechanism for implementing his 
concepts of military education. Obviously, certain educational 
institutions were reformed too soon. 
  However, I would not dramatize the situation as a whole; I 
would not draw hasty, revolutionary conclusions, as certain 
people who are far from the Army do. Necessary corrections must 
be made in a calm manner. 
  I would like to note here that we fully endorse the position 
of the current Defense Minister Radetskyy on protecting 
Ukraine's interests in the Crimea and strengthening military 
discipline, and that we support him in achieving this. 
  [Ben] Thus, if I have correctly understood your intentions, 
deputies-servicemen are not going to demand cardinal changes in 
our state's military doctrine? 
  [Skipalskyy] Perhaps it will be worthwhile to amend the 
military doctrine in a certain period of time. Yet, in general, 
it currently conforms to Ukraine's political course. The main 
thing is to implement it, and to resolve painful problems.

  [Text] A coup is planned in Crimea with all-round support 
from the Russian Federation. This statement was made in a 
Monday [16 May] interview with INTERFAX-UKRAINE by the leader of 
the Ukrainian RUKh (Movement) Vyacheslav Chornovil. According 
to him, on 20 May the Crimean parliament intends to return to 
the question of restoring the 1992 Crimean constitution which 
actually proclaims Crimea an independent state. 
  Chornovil thinks that after deciding on dual citizenship all 
key posts and control over processes in Crimea would be given 
over to Russian teams. He was also alarmed by the fact that 
high-ranking officials from Russia are taking part in the work 
of the Crimean parliament. 
  He stressed that in their speeches at plenary sessions of 
the 
Crimean parliament the head of the CIS committee of the Russian 
State Duma Konstantin Zatulin and a member of the Russian 
presidential council Andronik Migranian supported the idea of 
the new Crimean constitution and even promised all-round 
assistance in drafting it by several Russian MP's. Chornovil 
claimed that Russia has set up a constitutional development 
foundation which is involved in drafting the new Crimean 
constitution. 
  According to the RUKh leader, Russian high-ranking officials 
are prompting to Crimean leaders the idea of Crimean membership 
in the CIS and joint command as an independent member and 
suggesting that Crimea raise the question of the withdrawal of 
Ukrainian armed forces from its territory. 
  Chornovil said RUKh is planning to appeal to the UN Security 
Council, the CSCE as well as the president, parliament and 
Supreme Court of Ukraine to take immediate resolute steps 
following the attempts of the Crimean leadership to violate 
Helsinki accords.

  [Text] The Ukrainian RUKh has called for immediate tough 
measures against the Crimean leadership. A Monday [16 May] 
appeal to the Ukrainian president, parliament and Supreme Court 
says that in order to preserve the territorial integrity of the 
country foreign interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine 
should be rebuffed and an armed conflict provoked by separatist 
moves by the Crimean authorities prevented. 
  The document points to the illegality of the actions of the 
Crimean president and parliament, disregard for the Ukrainian 
and Crimean Tatar communities and the policy of separation from 
Ukraine. The document also claims that the Black Sea Fleet is 
used for pressurizing Ukraine. "In these circumstances the 
process of withdrawal of nuclear warheads under the trilateral 
agreement should be stopped," RUKh believes. 
  Also on Monday RUKh sent a message to the CSCE and the UN 
Security Council that claims that the present situation became 
possible as a result of direct and constant interference of 
Russian Government bodies in the affairs of a neighboring 
country contrary to all declarations of the Russian president 
and other top leaders about the observation of the principles of 
inviolability of frontiers and guarantees of territorial 
integrity.

power set of the Khmelnitskiy nuclear power station has once 
again been switched on to the grid following the completion of 
scheduled preventive maintenance work that lasted a little over 
a week. Nothing has been reported regarding the performance of 
the equipment. The radiation situation at the station and at

  [Excerpt] Charles Freeman, assistant secretary for regional 
security at the U.S. Defense Department, will arrive in Estonia 
today. More details now from Peeter Kaldre: 
  [Begin recording] [Kaldre] A U.S. working group on defense 
matters will arrive in Estonia today, led by Charles Freeman, 
assistant secretary for regional security. He will have 
meetings with Defense Minister Indrek Kannik and Defense Forces 
Commander Aleksander Einseln. 
  Defense Minister Kannik, what has brought about a visit to 
Estonia by such a high U.S. defense official? 
  [Kannik] A joint meeting of Estonian-U.S. working groups on 
defense issues will take place today. During the meeting both 
Assistant Secretary of Defense Charles Freeman and European 
[Principal Deputy Assistant] Secretary at the State Department 
Alexander Vershbow will provide a survey of the United States' 
European policy. Freeman will focus in his speech on the United 
States' positions on issues to do with the Partnership for Peace 
program, and Vershbow will speak about the new security 
situation in Europe. 
  Defense Forces Commander Major General Aleksander Einseln 
and 
myself will speaking on behalf of Estonia at this seminar. Maj 
Gen Einseln will introduce the current process of drafting a 
defense conception as well as defense reorganization in Estonia 
-- that is, the organization of Estonian defense forces and 
their aims. He will also provide a survey of the issues to do 
with the formation of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion. 
  I will speak about the Estonian security considerations in a 
broader sense, within the European context. 
  [Kaldre] You say that a joint Estonian-American working 
group 
exists. When was it set up and how often does it meet? 
  [Kannik] In this case it would be more correct to call it a 
joint seminar, with corresponding people from the U.S. working 
group and Estonian representatives meeting. There is no set 
time (?for the meetings) but the intention is that they should 
be held on a regular basis. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Estonian President Lennart Meri and Mrs. Helle Meri 
held a reception to the diplomatic corps accredited to Estonia 
on Tuesday [17 May], president's press service told ETA. 
  In the foreign policy part of his speech to the corps Meri 
stressed Estonia's wish to join NATO, pointing out granting the 
Baltic states West European Union associated [WEU] membership as 
a major event. During the next few months Estonia is to sign a 
free trade agreement with the European Union, Meri said. The 
European stability pact by the European Union offers good 
opportunities of cooperation to Estonia, especially as concerns 
integrating aliens into Estonian society and Estonian-Russian 
border problems, Meri said. As to the interior policy, 
President Meri criticized the unsatisfactory work of the 
Citizenship and Migration Board which has created additional 
tension. He was worried about the low standard of living of 
pensioners and other people with low income, the improvement of 
which depended on effective development of economy, Meri said. 
President also dwelt upon Estonian-Russian relations, saying 
that Estonia wanted friendly relations with Russia despite the 
wish to sign an agreement on withdrawal of all Russian troops 
from Estonia by August 31, 1994. 
  The answering speech was held by the doyen of the diplomatic 
corps, Ambassador of Sweden Lars Grundberg.

  [Excerpt] TALLINN, May 16, BNS - Initialing a troop 
withdrawal agreement like the one between Russia and Latvia 
would have ended with a no-confidence vote to the government in 
the Estonian parliament, parliament Speaker Ulo Nugis said in 
his comments to reporters after last weekend's session of the 
Baltic Assembly. 
  Latvia and Russia signed a framework agreement in April on 
Russian troop withdrawal together with a package of additional 
treaties, including one on the social protection of retired 
Russian military living in Latvia. Estonia so far has refused to 
make any concessions to Russia over the issue of the retired 
military, which has become a major reason for the current 
deadlock in the talks between the two countries. 
  Nugis in his remarks said the agreements signed between 
Latvia and Russia in no way influenced the relations between 
Estonia and Latvia. He said Estonia honors the right of Latvia 
as an independent country to sign whatever agreement it wishes. 
But he added that the signing of the treaties in Moscow had had 
a certain negative impact, leaving Estonia to some degree 
isolated. 
  The parliament speaker stated that Estonia is not going to 
make any concessions to Russia over the military pensioners' 
issue, because such is the government's "firm position and the 
people's will." He also said any such concessions would 
contradict the country's legislation and have an effect opposite 
to what is wished as to the country's demographic situation.

  [Text] TALLINN, May 16, BNS - Appointing a new Estonian 
delegation to continue the talks with Russia would mean acting 
in Russia's interest, Estonian MP Vardo Rumessen said today. 
  Rumessen was speaking at a protest meeting in front of the 
Russian naval headquarters in Tallinn. Weekly pickets are being 
held in front of the naval headquarters each Monday, and 
activists from the Estonian National Independence Party say 
protests will continue until Russian military have left the 
country. 
  "The situation at the talks is very good for Estonia," 
Rumessen said today. "It's Russia's problem that the talks have 
run into a deadlock." 
  Another MP, Enn Tarto, added that bending to pressure from 
Russia would mean acknowledging Moscow's policy of the so-called 
near abroad. 
  "Russia wants to make Estonia put up with the situation when 
Estonia would depend on Russia," Tarto said. 
  In Rumessen's words Russia is doing everything to overthrow 
Estonia's current government "with the help of her agents here." 
  Another well-known political activist, vice-president of the 
Organization of Unrepresented Nations Linnart Mall, called on 
the Russian military to leave Estonia. "Russian soldier, I love 
you; please go home and build up your home country," he shouted 
in his speech. 
  More emotional spots were added to today's picketing by the 
singing of Gaudeamus men's choir from Tartu.

  [Text] TALLINN, May 16, BNS - Estonia had 19,522 
officially registered unemployed as of May 1, who make up 2.32 
percent of the country's population in the working age groups. 
  The total number of registered jobless rose only by one 
person from the preceding month, said Inge Rauba, chief 
spokeswoman for the Labor Market Department. 
  But as Estonia in the meantime shifted from its previous 
reference basis for the number of potential workers of Dec. 1, 
1991, to a new basis of Jan. 1, 1994, the jobless rate rose one- 
tenth of a percent to 2.32 from April's 2.22 percent, she added. 
The number of people in the working age groups at the beginning 
of this year was 840,790. 
  The unemployment rate as of May 1 remained highest with 8.4 
percent, or 3,824 registered jobless, in the northeastern town 
of Narva. Next came the southern Polvamaa and Vorumaa 
agricultural regions, both with 6.09 percent, and the 
northeastern Ida-Virumaa region with its capital Kohtla Jarve 
with 5.39 percent. 
  Only 670 persons, or 0.26 percent of the work force, were 
registered as out of job in Tallinn. Unemployment rates remain 
under the one-percent line also in the northern Laane-Virumaa 
region and the western Laanemaa region with its capital Parnu.

  [Text] Estonia's most efficient major firms are based on 
private capital, Finance Ministry section head Toivo Mungel told 
a news conference yesterday. 
  The fifty most successful firms were chosen according to 
seven main indicators, including circulation, profit, 
profitability, growth rate and export potential, he explained. 
The role of wood processing is increasing while that of metal 
trading and processing has started to decrease, Mungel said. He 
pointed out that the food industry is stable, but the share of 
high-technology production needs to be increased. 
  The average growth rate of export was 7 per cent per month 
in 
1993, Mungel told the news conference, adding that the top 50 
also included a one-man firm.

  [Text] RIGA, May 16, BNS - The Latvian defense and other 
security-related officials met with a U.S. delegation Saturday 
[14 May] to discuss the further bilateral cooperation in the 
security sphere. 
  The Clinton administration has asked the U.S. Congress to 
extend financial resources to support the projected Baltic 
Peacekeeping Battalion, Charles Freeman, U.S. deputy defense 
secretary, told reporters after the meeting. 
  If the funding is allotted, it will be used for training and 
equipment purchase, Freeman said. 
  Latvian Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis said the meeting 
also touched on Latvia's involvement in NATO's Partnership for 
Peace program, Latvian defense forces reorganization and 
potential U.S. technical assistance to defense forces and Home 
Guard. 
  The foreign assistance to the Latvian defense forces should 
be based on clearcut plans and programs, said Pavlovskis. 
  American specialists mentioned the lack of uniform armament 
and provision system as the main problem for the setup of 
efficient Baltic defense forces. The Baltic military commands 
will try to settle the problem, Pavlovskis said. 
  The U.S. delegation also toured the Latvian naval base at 
Bolderaja and reconnaissance battalion at Suzi.

  [Text] Riga, May 17, BNS -- The Latvian Farmers' Union and 
its allied organizations decided Tuesday [17 May] against 
leaving the ruling parliament coalition, which it forms with the 
Latvia's Way faction. 
  The Farmers' Federation Council, which includes the Farmers' 
Union, said it would continue talks with the government to 
tackle the problems of farmers and ensure policy favorable for 
the development of agriculture. 
  On the other hand, the federation plans to propose a popular 
no confidence vote to the government and the parliament if they 
fail to settle privatization of food processors, to protect food 
market, to finance and credit farmers and to introduce favorable 
taxation before the Aug. 1 deadline. 
  In addition, the federation demands a leadership shake-up in 
the Economics Ministry because Minister Ojars Kehris is said to 
be responsible for the unfavorable economic situation. 
  The Latvian Farmers' Union faction will not propose Kehris' 
resigning in the Saeima (parliament) but will discuss it in 
coalition sittings, said faction head Andris Rozentals. 
  Latvia has 180,000 individual farms at the moment, said 
Farmers' Federation deputy chairman, Andris Auzins. From those, 
only 1,000 are well-off, 7,000 to 8,000 "make the ends meet," 
while the rest live on family allowances and retirement 
pensions, he said. 
  The agriculture suffers most from the chaotic situation on 
the domestic market and the uncontrolled import of food stuffs, 
Auzins said. 
  Agriculture Minister Janis Kinna argued that the Latvian 
food 
market was the best protected in the Baltics in view of the 
introduced import tariffs on farm produce. 
  The Latvian Farmers' Union ran for the incumbent Saeima 
together with the Farmers' Federation, the Unlawfully Repressed 
Persons Association and the Daugavas Vanagi organization. In 
the Saeima, it joined Latvia's Way to form the ruling coalition, 
which now unites 47 deputies. From those, three have been 
suspended on KGB collaboration charges.

  [Text] RIGA, May 16, BNS - The Bank of Latvia decided to 
finish the exchange of Latvian rubles for lats before July 1, 
its spokesman Edzus Vejins told BNS. 
  The Latvian ruble was introduced in May, 1992, as a 
provisional legal tender. After the introduction of the national 
currency, the lat, on March 5, 1993, the Latvian rubles were 
circulated in parallel with the lats. 
  The Bank of Latvia gradually withdrew the rubles from 
circulation and exchanged them for lats against the exchange 
rate 1:200. 
  According to information at the central bank's disposal, 
residents hold around 0.2 percent of the totally issued Latvian 
rubles.

<F P=106> [Leonid Mlechin article: "Moscow's Absurd Game with NATO </F>
Will Open the Bloc's Doors to East Europe and the Baltic"] 
  [Text] The Partnership for Peace [PFP] program was an act 
of courtesy to Russia on the part of the West. Why has this 
been forgotten in Russia? "The process of drafting a joint 
Russian-NATO document be dragged out for months or even years," 
a high-ranking Russian diplomat told IZVESTIYA. 
  If that happens, there is little chance of signing a 
document: The closer the presidential elections come, the less 
desire there will be to establish partnership relations with 
NATO. Will Defense Minister Pavel Grachev drop a hint to the 
NATO members about this? He is awaited in Brussels, where they 
hope he will finally be able to explain to the North Americans 
and West Europeans what it is Russia wants from NATO. Although 
it does not seem that Moscow itself knows the answer to that 
question. 
  "The signing of the Partnership for Peace program is 
secondary to Moscow," the Russian diplomat explained to 
IZVESTIYA. "The establishment of new relations with NATO in the 
political sphere and the recognition of Russia's special role on 
the continent and its right to influence decisionmaking are 
primary. NATO appreciates what has caused the delay in signing 
the Partnership for Peace document and is not putting pressure 
on us...." 
  NATO's Partnership for Peace program, which has provoked a 
storm of objections in the Russian political world, emerged as a 
result of a request (not to say a demand) from Moscow that the 
East European and Baltic states not be admitted to NATO. At the 
end of last year this was a very important task for Russian 
diplomacy on the European plane. 
  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel invited Andrey Kozyrev 
back to his own home in order to explain to him in an unofficial 
setting that all Moscow's former satellites wanted to join NATO 
and that NATO had no grounds whatsoever for refusing them. What 
did Moscow want from the West? 
  Russia's vigorous diplomacy was crowned with the utter 
humiliation of East Europe and the Baltic states: At the 
top-level NATO forum in January the latter were not admitted to 
the North Atlantic bloc. Mindful here of Russia's interests, 
the Americans devised Partnership for Peace, a vacuous program 
which binds no one to anything. The lofty words uttered at the 
time about "the importance of the first move" were only going to 
fool the greenhorns. 
  Only a few months have now passed, and Moscow, forgetting 
this background, is making complaints to the Americans and West 
Europeans: How dare you try to foist such a document on a great 
military power, a document which has been signed by the likes of 
Albania, Georgia, Lithuania, and other minor states? 
  The games being played over Partnership for Peace are the 
result, first, of a knee-jerk desire on the part of the 
opposition to reject anything proposed by the president and 
government, and, second, an atavistic hatred and fear of NATO. 
  The opposition refuses to understand here that the United 
States signed the same treaty establishing NATO in 1949 as 
Belgium or the Netherlands. However, this formal parity changes 
nothing as regards the correlation of real political weight and 
is forgotten when decisions are made. The vagueness of the NATO 
program is offensive to the East Europeans but convenient to 
Russia: You can negotiate about whatever you like. 
  Cynically speaking, in the whole East European area NATO is 
really interested only in building relations with Russia. Our 
country's participation or nonparticipation in the Partnership 
for Peace program changes nothing in that regard. 
  However, an ostentation reluctance to sign the program will 
have one obvious consequence: East Europe and the Baltic states 
will obtain yet another indisputable argument in their struggle 
to gain a NATO membership card. The readiness of above all the 
United States and Germany to oppose their pressure is in inverse 
proportion to Moscow's anti-NATO game.

  [Text] The Russian defense minister, Pavel Grachev, will go 
to Brussels on the 23d of this month on a three-day visit. He 
will submit at the NATO headquarters Russia's proposals for the 
NATO program Partnership for Peace. Here is what our observer 
Anatoliy Potapov writes about Russia's relations with NATO: 
  It is hard to guess what proposals the Russian defense 
minister will take to NATO. Most likely it is not going to be 
one of those documents currently under preparation by Russian 
experts. Apparently General Grachev intends to talk about the 
terms in which Russia will participate in the NATO program. 
  Given some statements made recently by President Boris 
Yeltsin and other Russian leaders, there are no objections to 
Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace program. 
The single document, obligatory for signing by all the member 
states, does not perceive any concrete actions or joint 
decisions. As many European politicians describe it, it is only 
a declaration of intentions. The signing of the document will 
not commit Russia to anything. The document does not outline 
any prospects for cooperation. Then what is this partnership 
all about? 
  The point is that Russia is seeking serious, large-scale, 
equal cooperation with NATO. Russia has the right to expect 
NATO will not disregard its special geopolitical situation, its 
role on the world scene and, finally, its military might no 
other European state can boast of. Thus it is necessary to find 
a reasonable combination of the equity of all participants in 
the NATO program and Russia's special role in it. This is the 
essence of the problem of Russia's partnership with NATO. As 
for Russia, it is preparing a bilateral document with clear-cut, 
concrete parameters of partnership. 
  So far, the concept of the future document is a matter of 
guesswork. Hopefully it will reflect the principles of 
preserving the organizational structure and the unique character 
of the Russian army, now numbering some 3 million, and the 
standards of its often unique armaments. Russia is a European 
but also an Asian state. It would be reasonable to word the 
future document so as to rule out all possible fears and 
speculations on the part of its Asian neighbors. 
  It's worthy to note that some East European countries regard 
the NATO program only as the first stage of their full-fledged 
membership in this bloc. Some statements by prominent Western 
politicians support such aspirations. While Russia's idea of 
the Partnership for Peace is different, Russia wants all 
European states to join efforts to promote stability on the 
continent. It does not see this document as a way to extend 
NATO in the eastern direction, a way to a new splitting of 
Europe. Russia is open and straightforward about this, seeking 
to provide a firm basis for its wide-range [as heard] 
cooperation with the North Atlantic bloc.

"`Technologies From Russia' Astound United States"] 
  [Text] The three-day conference "Technologies From 
Russia-94" in the United States has been a real triumph for 
Russian applied science and leading sectors of industry. But 
the exhibition of the latest achievements of Russian designers 
and manufacturers held simultaneously at the Washington 
conference center evoked even greater interest among American 
entrepreneurs. Over 200 Russian firms presented the latest 
developments in the sphere of machine building, the aerospace 
and medical industries, information technology, and 
communications for the verdict of U.S. specialists. 
  Judging by the U.S. press reaction, what made the greatest 
impression on visitors to the exhibition was the "Thermoplane" 
[Termoplan] -- the product of a consortium of enterprises in the 
Russian oil and gas complex and mining and timber industries. 
It is an airship of a fundamentally new design in the form of a 
"flying saucer" capable of carrying 3.5 tonnes of freight or 
15-20 passengers. The industrial version of the "Thermoplane" 
will be capable of delivering up to 600 tonnes of freight 
distances of up to 5,000 km -- superb transportation for the 
north and taiga and desert regions. 
  Transatlantic businessmen also showed interest in units for 
the production of synthetic diamonds and metal-cutting tools 
produced on the basis of them, whose productivity is 7-10 times 
higher than metal tools. The six-wheeled minitractor employing 
technology from our "lunokhods" [moon buggies] also aroused 
public curiosity. In general, many of the projects on show at 
the exhibition were characterized by extensive use of conversion 
developments. 
  Over two dozen contracts for joint production or further 
development of promising technologies and technical prototypes 
have already been signed as a result of the conference and 
exhibition.

  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Russia wants to pay only 40 
per cent of its foreign debt payable in 1994 and hopes the Paris 
Club of creditors would accept the proposals at talks in the 
second half of June, according to Deputy Prime Minister 
Aleksandr Shokhin who told a press conference on Tuesday that 
such a position is called by the existing financial 
possibilities of the country. 
  Shokhin, who is the main foreign debt negotiator, said the 
federal budget envisages only a little over four billion dollars 
to cover all external debts while Russia owes the Paris Club one 
billion dollars of interest only for the first quarter of this 
year. The total Russian debt amounts to 80 billion dollars. 
  Shokhin said that if Russia is made to cover the whole debt 
payable in 1994 this would mean curtailing of other budget 
appropriations or higher inflation. "We hope that the Western 
partners will understand that if Russia fulfils its foreign debt 
commitments in full volume, this would inevitably result in 
surpassing the budget-fixed amount for servicing the foreign 
debt which means either curtailing other appropriations or 
spiraling up inflation", he stressed. 
  Shokhin recalled that the Paris Club had twice met the 
requests of the Russian Government taking into consideration the 
difficult reforms in the country. The creditors had first 
agreed to freeze for 15 years the payment of 15 billion dollars 
of the Russian debt and then rescheduled the payment of last 
year interest for the first four months of 1994. 
  Russia is currently preparing concrete proposals to the 
Paris 
Club which will be submitted before the G-7 summit in Naples, 
according to Shokhin.

  The FSK chief said Yeltsin was aware of the incidents of 
government corruption and taking appropriate measures. He also

"who is just as tough as the president" on matters of government 
corruption. 
  The FSK chief also spoke of anti-terrorist squads being set 
up in Moscow and parts of Russia.

  [Text] Turkmenistan has resumed gas exports to Ukraine in 
full after the Russian and Ukrainian state gas companies reached 
agreement on the terms of gas delivery via Russian territory on 
Saturday, a Russian company official told Interfax. 
  Turkmenistan ceased gas exports to Ukraine early this year 
after Kiev's failure to service its gas bill of 600 million 
dollars. Until recently, Moscow was helping Ukraine by stepping 
up its own gas exports to that country under a deal the two 
sides struck in the Russian capital on March 10. 
  It is now known that Russia and Ukraine are due to start 
talks in Moscow on Tuesday to discuss the whole range of 
bilateral relations including Kiev's failure to service its debt 
for gas imports from Russia. 
  Kiev does not follow the schedule of debt repayment put down 
in a protocol the two sides signed on April 12, a senior 
official of Russia's Gazprom company said. 
  He also said that Belarus' gas debt did not increase as fast 
as Ukraine's and Moldova's debt (Russia cut back gas exports to 
Kishinev [Chisinau] by 30 percent in April). 
  The official said Moldova was holding talks with a number of 
European banks to try to get loans to be able to repay its debt 
to Moscow. 
  Under bilateral agreements, Russia's gas exports to Belarus, 
Ukraine and Moldova this year will run at 16.4, 54.8 and 3.1 
billion cu meters respectively.

  [Text] At the Russian-Ukrainian talks held in the Russian 
Ministry for Cooperation with the CIS countries 
(Minsotrudnichestvo) on Tuesday, the Ukrainian side "pledged to 
take measures for repayment of part of its debt to Russia for 
fuel supplies." The Agency of Oil Information learned this from 
well-informed sources in Minsotrudnichestvo. According to them, 
the debt as of May 1 is more than 1,485 trillion rubles, 
including for gas -- 1.22 trillion rubles, for oil -- 200.6 
billion rubles, electricity -- 29 billion rubles, coal -- 21.8 
billion rubles, oil products -- 6.5 billion rubles. Ukraine's 
debt for Russian fuel increased last month by 440 billion rubles 
(in all CIS countries -- by 900 billion). 
  Sources noted that during the talks which "passed in a 
businesslike and friendly atmosphere," in particular, a 
timetable for repaying debts for Russian oil was set up, under 
which Ukraine will pay Russia 125 million dollars by the end of 
May. 
  As for the debt for Russian gas supplies, in the opinion of 
Minsotrudnichestvo officials, close and permanent contacts 
between the Russian Gazprom and the Ukrainian Ukrgazprom bring 
"positive results." 
  The sources noted that Gazprom has no intention of cutting 
gas supplies to Ukrainian consumers in the near future, although 
Ukraine is failing to implement a number of provisions in the 
Russian-Ukrainian protocols of March 10 and 12. "This is not 
the time for such drastic actions," they noted. 
  During the talks the two sides agreed to carry out "joint 
control" over supplies of Ukrainian equipment and 
material-technical resources for repayment of debt to Gazprom 
and to speed up the signing of a contract for the construction 
of 170,000 square meters of housing for gas workers by Ukrainian 
construction organizations.

  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Ukraine is ready to sell 42 
strategic bombers which it inherited from the former Soviet 
Union to Russia, but claims eight billion U.S. dollars for them 
(15 trillion roubles), while Russia believes 217 billion roubles 
are enough. 
  Although Russia needs the planes it will not pay such a 
price 
for them. "If Ukraine does not agree to our terms the planes 
will remain on its territory," Liutenant-General Yuriy Merkulov 
from the Defence Ministry told TASS. 
  Military experts told TASS on Tuesday that Russia needs the 
bombers as they are not liable to reduction under the START I 
Treaty. They will be decommissioned only after their service 
time expires. 
  At present the Russian Air Force has 77 heavy bombers and it 
is hard to build new ones because of financial difficulties. No 
changes are planned by the Defence Ministry regarding the number 
of bombers. 
  Defence Ministry sources also told TASS that Russian 
estimates were made in 1993 prices and took into account 
ammortization costs, but Ukraine objected to such an approach. 
  At the same time Kiev has no money and technical 
possibilities to maintain the bombers in proper order by itself.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Andrey Serov, Lev Rumyantsev, </F>
and Lev Frolov] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg May 18 TASS -- Prince Charles, 
currently visiting here, called for the creation of "easier 
conditions" for foreign investors in Russia. Addressing the 
forum of leaders of the business world, now under way here, the 
Prince of Wales expressed satisfaction with the fact that 
Russia, particularly St. Petersburg, was already carrying out 
several concrete projects with the participation of British 
businessmen. He said that if St. Petersburg was regarded in 
Russia as a window into Europe, it was for him a window into 
Russia. He believes that the cityscape of any centre of 
population is important for the successful development of 
entrepreneurship and St. Petersburg was lucky in this respect. 
The monotype architecture of many other modern megapolises 
makes them spiritless, which has a negative effect on business, 
he stated. 
  The prince dwelt on the responsibility of entrepreneurship, 
on the need to ensure proper balance between wealth and the 
social sphere. In his opinion, a market economy cannot decide 
by itself the task of building up a sound society, but can 
combat such phenomena as hunger and poverty. It is most 
important, at the same time, to safeguard the environment. 
  Addressing the forum, St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak 
said that the West realises that Russia has lived through the 
most difficult stage of the reforms. If no new mistakes are 
made in the course of the ongoing reforms, the country's economy 
will begin to perk up by the end of 1994. Sobchak criticised 
the Western mass media which frequently speculates on such 
subjects as growing crime in Russia and its alleged 
neoimperialist designs. This desire to slur Russia is explained 
by their realisation that the reviving Russian economy will 
become an increasingly active competitor on the international 
market. The mayor believes that such negative tendencies are 
not be seen in relations with Great Britain and that cooperation 
between that country and Russia has "brilliant prospects." 
  On Tuesday, the British guests called at the St. Petersburg 
Mariinskiy Hospital. Its building was designed by architect 
Giacomo Quarenghi early last century. It, so to speak, 
illustrates the extraordinary history of Russia's first 
multi-profile clinic. The hospital was intended for the poor 
and was patronaged by the imperial family until the revolution 
of 1917. It was backed by generous charity donations. As the 
entire Russian public health service, this hospital, catering to 
more than 30,000 patients a year, is today badly in need of 
investments. "The positive emotions, evoked by Prince Charles' 
visit, had, without doubt, a curing effect on our patients," 
chief physician of the Mariinskiy Hospital Alla Popova said. 
  Prince Charles talked with a group of St. Petersburg 
businessmen in the library of the hospital. They discussed 
possible investment projects in the humanitarian sphere. "It is 
yet difficult to say anything certain about the initiatives of 
our potential British patrons, but our foundation is ready to 
cooperate with them in the sphere of charity," ITAR-TASS was 
told by Lyudmila Nurusova, president of the Mariinskiy 
Foundation. 
  Prince Charles' St. Petersburg agenda includes a visit to 
one 
more medical establishment -- the hospice clinic for incurables. 
The distinguished guest plans to visit it on May 19, the last 
day of his stay in Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Pascal Delumuraz, chief of the Swiss </F>
Department of Public Economy, by Konstantin Pribytkov: 
"Switzerland Comes Closer For Russians"] 
  [Text] Bern -- Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, federal adviser and 
chief of the department (minister) of public economy of 
Switzerland, has been visiting Moscow at the invitation of Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. During his visit an agreement was 
signed on trade and economic cooperation between our two 
countries. 
  On the eve of the trip ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin 
Pribytkov interviewed Mr Delamuraz. The minister said, in 
particular: 
  "I am sure that Russian-Swiss relations have a big future. 
The agreement we have signed is intended to start a new chapter 
in partnership links between the two states. Switzerland wants 
the transformations in Russia to succeed. Everything that 
contributes to strengthening the liberal order in the world is 
of fundamental significance, in the Swiss government's view. 
The trip is a public expression of the Swiss will for 
cooperation with the Russian Federation." 
  The federal adviser sees the present level of trade and 
economic relations as "relatively modest and much lower than it 
could be." While the average annual volume of trade with the 
former USSR exceeded two billion Swiss francs, last year it was 
approximately 700 million, which is "clearly not enough." 
"Russia needs us, and we need an economically developed Russia." 
  [Pribytkov] How did the collapse of the former USSR affect 
bilateral trade? 
  [Delamuraz] It was destructive, certainly. We are currently 
at the stage of reestablishing our economic contacts along 
decentralized lines. Where we used to have one partner, we now 
have dozens. I think one major problem is finance and the need 
to create an effective and reliable banking system. 
  [Pribytkov] Investments in Russia are still regarded by some 
Western businessmen as very risky. Do you agree? 
  [Delamuraz] Indeed, capital investments in Russia are 
particularly risky. As we get to know one another better and 
establish relations of personal trust, these risks will become 
easier to calculate and predict. A reliable juridical system is 
of paramount importance in this respect. Swiss investors are 
notoriously cautious. But once they get down to the job they 
remain dedicated to it and prove themselves to be reliable 
partners. I hope that our relations in the investments sphere 
will become more intensive in the next few months and years. 
  [Pribytkov] As is known, Switzerland has instituted credit 
guarantees to help countries with transitional economies. What 
is the future of these credits? 
  [Delamuraz] Our assistance for Russia and the other CIS 
states is only now becoming effective. I might mention the 
recently instituted line of credit guarantees for Russia in the 
sum of 100 million Swiss francs. We are also studying and 
implementing a number of specific projects in the spheres of 
technical assistance and infrastructure development. This is 
just the initial stage. But no matter what foreign governments 
do, state funds are always limited, so, ultimately, economic 
cooperation must be driven by private entrepreneurs and 
investors. 
  [Pribytkov] Russian officials are urging Western partners to 
lift trade restrictions. This would help the reforms even more 
than other forms of assistance. What do you think? 
  [Delamuraz] I entirely agree that trade is better than aid. 
Trade partners are responsible for what they say. Markets have 
to be even more open. In our case, I think I can say that the 
Swiss market is wide open to all foreign goods, regardless of 
their provenance. 
  [Pribytkov] What spheres of economic cooperation can be 
regarded as the most promising, in your view? 
  [Delamuraz] I think there are many spheres in which our two 
countries could cooperate more intensively and obtain mutual 
benefit. The foundation of Swiss industry is made up, in 
particular, of small and medium-sized enterprises. As for 
specific sectors of industry, our companies have acquired a 
worldwide reputation in such spheres as machine building and the 
chemical, pharmaceutical, watchmaking, and food industries. 
Most of these sectors are distinguished by highly intensive 
research and know-how. Swiss financial and insurance services 
are highly specialized and competitive.

  [Text] Moscow may 17 TASS -- "You can be optimistic, 
because the reforms, which took the other countries several 
decades to accomplish, are proceeding at a much faster pace in 
your country," Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs Guido di 
Tella, currently paying an official visit to the Russian 
capital, told ITAR-TASS. 
  "Much is being written in the Western press about the 
catastrophic situation in Russia," he said. "However, I got 
quite a different impression. I am witnessing a country which 
is attaining its goals in spite of huge difficulties. The 
situation in Russia is difficult, indeed, but it should not be 
gauged by the same yardsticks as in Western Europe. They must 
be different for Russia. In my opinion, Russia is today enjoying 
great respect on the international arena," the minister stated. 
  Touching on his talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, Guido di Tella described them as frank and friendly, 
conducive to the raising of mutual relations to a qualitatively 
new level. 
  Assessing the present state of the Argentine-Russian 
relations, the minister said that they were unquestionably 
better than at any other past period, because "it is very 
difficult to be on friendly terms with communists". It is 
possible to promote friendly business relations with Russia 
today, "because we speak the same language, think in like terms, 
adhere to principles of tolerance and constructive relations". 
  The minister believes that Russia has a great future. 
"Naturally," he said, "development never runs smoothly. There 
are always ups and downs." Noting that Russia was using 
different means to promote its reforms, the minister stressed 
that it was achieving successes in spite of all the existing 
difficulties. In his opinion, the only thing that Russia needed 
today was "some order in the country. It must not invent any 
new social systems".

  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- The Russian-Argentinean 
documents recently signed in Moscow bring the bilateral 
relations onto a new level, said Argentinean Foreign Minister 
Guido di Tella. 
  Argentina is a key Latin American state, and Russia is 
working to expand and establish contacts with regional political 
organizations and economic groups. 
  Although no economic cooperation documents have been signed, 
it is not accidental Guido di Tella is accompanied by a large 
group of Argentinean businessmen. In the words of Secretary for 
Foreign Economic Relations of the Argentinean Foreign Ministry 
Jorge Campbell, the visit opens up broad prospects for the 
expansion of bilateral trade and economic cooperation in various 
spheres. 
  When in St. Petersburg and Moscow the Argentinean 
businessmen 
met local entrepreneurs and were received by Deputy Russian 
Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Vladimir Karastin. Upon 
his return from St. Petersburg, Guido di Tella said that his 
ministry will render comprehensive political support to all new 
forms of bilateral trade and economic cooperation if the 
business community initiates the expansion of bilateral 
relations. 
  The Russian-Argentinean diplomatic relations were 
established 
in 1885. Now that Argentina is a major member of the South 
American common market, Russian interest in this state has 
considerably increased. Argentina also has a large Russian 
diaspora. 
  The Moscow documents is the basis and the upper part of the 
"bilateral cooperation iceberg", said Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev upon the completion of negotiations with his 
Argentinean colleague. Argentina is a member of the United 
Nations Security Council, and the Russian-Argentinean 
cooperation has both bilateral and global dimensions, he 
stressed. 
  The Moscow visit of Guido di Tella is a landmark in 
bilateral 
and Russian-Latin American relations, he said. 
  In his turn, the Argentinean foreign minister believes in 
the 
Russian future and considers the Russian Federation to be a 
great world power. The only thing necessary is to put the 
country in order and abstain from inventing new social systems, 
he said.

trawler "Vostochnoye Okno-1", belonging to this Russian firm, 
has been arrested in the Walvis Bay port on the Atlantic Coast 
of Namibia, under a supreme court of Namibia decision. The 
Namibian branch of the company owes a huge sum to its partners. 
  Two fishing companies of Namibia, "Erongo Sea Products" and 
"T.N.P. Fishing", sued the Russian company for over two million 
Namibian dollars (about 550,000 U.S. dollars). This amount was 
made up from the cost of supplying ships and credits paid 
against future fishings. Recently the court ruled the claims 
justified. 
  The Namibian representation of the "Vostochnoye Okno" was 
fishing in Namibia's coastal zone with the help of four 
trawlers. Now this fleet is disintegrated. The "Vostochnoye 
Okno-2", one of the vessels, was transferred to recover debts to 
the "Sovrybflot", the joint-stock company set up to replace 
former all-union foreign trade amalgamation. The crew of the 
second ship, "Alma", has established direct ties with Namibians. 
At last, the leased trawler "Venera-4" from Odessa, suspecting 
something wrong, headed home on "French leave" in March together 
with its fish catch, which was to be delivered to Zaire. As a 
result, the Odessa-based fishing amalgamation "Antarktida" has 
been declared company non-grata in the southern Africa. 
  Currently there are about 30 trawlers from Russia, Ukraine, 
Lithuania and Estonia, fishing for four companies off the 
Namibian coasts.

  [Text] Abijan May 18 TASS -- The Russian ship Zolotitsa has 
been detained in the capital of Liberia for "an illegal call at 
the port of Monrovia and unauthorized delivery of 81 foreigners 
to the country", the Liberian Ministry of Justice said in a 
statement released on Tuesday. The statement says that eleven 
employees of the immigration service in the port have been 
charged with "neglecting their duties". 
  The ship arrived in the port two weeks ago, and 81 persons 
suspected of being mercenaries disembarked, the statement says. 
They landed and disappeared before the immigration service 
employees had time to understand what was happening. It was not 
immediately known from what country they arrived and what was 
Zolotitsa's last port of call before Monrovia. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS to comment on the incident, a Liberian 
Embassy official in Cote d'Ivoire replied that "he does not have 
any details of the case". 
  The other day the leader of one of the military-political 
groupings of Liberia's United Liberation Movement for Democracy 
Roosevelt Johnson accused the leader of another faction of the 
same grouping, Alhaji Kromah and his supporters from the 
Mandingo tribe of using the services of foreign mercenaries in 
fighting the ethnic group of Kran. 
  Kromah rejected the allegations as "groundless, slanderous 
and aimed at provoking unrest".

  [Text] Moscow May 22 TASS -- The Russian Government pledged 
to see to it that agreements with "De Beers" international 
diamond giant are observed and no unauthorized shipments of 
Russian diamonds to the world market are made, according to a 
joint communique on the first round of Russian-De Beers talks 
forwarded to BUSINESS-TASS on Wednesday. 
  Russian Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin and "De Beers" 
chairman of the central selling organisation Nicky Oppenheimer 
also agreed after two-day talks which ended on Wednesday to 
abide in their cooperation by the agreement which expires in the 
end of 1995. 
  Russia wanted to change the agreement which envisages that 
95 
per cent of its diamonds are marketed through "De Beers" and 
five per cent independently. It strives to increase the 
independent share. 
  "Until the moment when any changes are agreed the sides 
remain adherent to the terms of the agreement which is valid 
until the end of 1995. Both sides pledge to adopt the necessary 
measures to cease shipments of Russian jewellery diamonds to the 
world market by bypassing the existing agreements on the sales 
of the products", according to the communique. 
  The sides also pledged their mutual responsibility for the 
fate of the world diamond market and the well-being of all 
diamond producers. They expressed hope that a new series of 
talks would restore the stable basis for future cooperation and 
thus will create guarantees for a further development of the 
diamond business for the benefit of both sides and the world 
diamond industry.

  [Text] Moscow takes a positive view of Baghdad's 
cooperation with the UN in the field of disarmament and hopes 
that this trend will consolidate, Viktor Posuvalyuk, Russian 
president's special Middle East envoy said at a briefing in 
Moscow Tuesday. 
  He said that this kind of cooperation would make the lifting 
of international sanctions against Iraq a real possibility. He 
said that it was essential that Iraq made up its mind about 
disarmament, allowed international observers in and recognized 
Kuwait's independence and borders. 
  Posuvalyuk said that the Syrian-Israeli settlement was at 
the 
moment the decisive element of an overall Middle East solution. 
He took note of the fact that the Syrian demand that Israel 
leave the Syrian territory captured in 1967 was difficult to 
reconcile with the Israeli demand that the border situation be 
normalized and security provided first. 
  He said that this issue was under discussion both in direct 
negotiations and through mediators and that hopeful signs were 
visible. 
  Posuvalyuk also said that he would go to Damascus shortly 
for 
consultations with officials of Syria and other Middle East 
nations involved in the peace process. 
  He said that 696 Russian nationals had been evacuated from 
Yemen before May 15, notably 453 from the north and 249 from the 
south. A total of about 400 Russian remained there, notably 
those who stayed on business and Russian women who had taken 
permanent residence there. 
  Posuvalyuk said that some of them did not bother to register 
with Russian offices in the country. 
  He called on the leaders of the two parts of Yemen to stop 
the fratricidal war. He went on to say that the calls had had 
no effect but Russia continued a dialog with Yemeni officials. 
He added that Russian diplomats were in continuous contact with 
the Yemeni leaders.

  [Text] Moscow highly appraises cooperation between the UN 
and Baghdad in the sphere of disarmament and hopes that it will 
increase. This was stated by Russian president's envoy to the 
Middle East Viktor Posuvalyuk at a briefing in Moscow today. 
  He said this would create real conditions for the partial 
lifting of the international sanctions against Iraq. "It is 
necessary that Iraq define its position on disarmament and let 
international observers in. Baghdad also must recognize the 
independence of Kuwait and inviolability of its borders," 
Posuvalyuk pointed out. 
  Commenting on a settlement in the Middle East, Posuvalyuk 
stressed that relations between Syria and Israel were the main 
direction there. "Contradictions are very serious here. 
Damascus demands that Israel liberate the Syrian territories 
occupied in 1967 and Israel demands complete normalization of 
the situation on the border and security," he said. 
  Posuvalyuk emphasized that this issue was being discussed at 
direct talks between the parties and through mediators. He said 
that encouraging progress had been achieved. 
  He announced that he would go to Damascus in the next few 
days where he would hold consultations with representatives of 
Syria and other Middle East countries involved in the peace 
settlement in the region. 
  Posuvalyuk spoke on the situation in Yemen in details. He 
announced that 696 Russian citizens had been evacuated from 
Yemen by May 15.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- "The Libyan republic is in no 
way involved in the so-called `Lockerbie case'. It condemns 
manifestations of terrorism in all their forms and is prepared 
to take part in the investigation of this tragic incident in 
order to punish the guilty," ITAR-TASS was told today by Libyan 
Ambassador to Russia Muhammad 'Husni Sha'ban. 
  The ambassador dwelt on the charges advanced against Libya 
the United States and Great Britain. Two Libyan citizens are 
known to be suspected of organising an explosion on board a 
Pan-American liner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988. 
France accuses Libyan agents of blowing up a French liner, 
belonging to the UTA air company, in Niger in 1989. These 
incident claimed the lives of 449 people. 
  The ambassador noted that Libya had insisted on a "fair and 
just" investigation of the charges brought against its citizens, 
who should be first tried by a Libyan court. Later it had 
softened its stand and agreed that the investigation should be 
conducted by The Hague International Court. The United Nations 
and the Arab League could find an appropriate legal basis for 
this. It had also offered to conduct a joint investigation by 
representatives from the United States, Great Britain, Libya and 
several other states. According to Sha'ban, all these proposals 
were rejected by Washington and London. They continue to insist 
on the unconditional extradition of the suspects, to which Libya 
cannot agree, of course. The Arab League even offered to try 
the two Libyans by a court of Scottish judges and according to 
Scottish laws at The Hague International Court, but this 
compromise was turned down by the British side. On the whole, 
the Libyan leadership holds that the two Libyan citizens, whose 
crime has not been proved, are merely suspects, not even 
defendants. Hence, the demand for their extradition is legally 
ungrounded. "We decided to put off the case indefinitely, 
because we have exhausted all our arsenal of reasonable 
proposals and are now looking forward to constructive steps from 
the other side," Sha'ban said. The Arab League, the African 
Unity Organisation, and the Islamic Conference Organisation, 
accounting for the majority of the U.N. membership, have 
condemned the U.N. sanctions against Libya, imposed on Western 
insistence." 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS to describe the current state of 
Libyan-Russian relations, the ambassador noted that, in his 
opinion, the U.N. Security Council Resolution 748 of May 31, 
1989, imposing international economic sanctions on Libya, was 
primarily intended to cause material and moral damage to 
Tripoli. Moreover, it was a deliberate blow, inflicted by the 
masterminds of the resolution on Libyan-Soviet relations, and on 
relations between Libya and the USSR's successor -- Russia. 
  "The carefully worded boycott resolution," he said, "is 
spearheaded against the delivery to my country of armaments and 
other military hardware, which mostly came from Moscow. The 
embargo on air traffic was also mainly directed against Russia, 
with which we were then conducting talks on the improvement of 
air carriages. At the same time, the oil, which is being used by 
the West, remained outside the embargo. As a result, the damage 
caused to Libya and Russia amounted to several billion U.S. 
dollars. The treaties, agreements and contracts are to expire 
in all the spheres they cover only in 1997, but they have 
already been suspended, just as payments for Russian services in 
the sphere of economic deliveries, personnel training, 
maintenance of technical facilities, including military 
installations. In other words, the process of cooperation 
between the two countries was suspended. 
  The ambassador refused to give the exact figures of this 
cooperation, but, according to information received by ITAR-TASS 
from other sources, Tripoli's debt to Moscow totalled 21 billion 
U.S. dollars in the period from 1970 until today. Approximately 
18 billions have already been paid. 
  In conclusion, Sha'ban expressed regret that Russia was 
voting in the U.N. Security Council for further sanctions 
against Libya. At the same time, he expressed satisfaction with 
the fact that Moscow was lately trying to mediate between 
Tripoli and the other parties to the conflict, but so far its 
initiatives have not evoked any response from the West.

Federation. He completed his working visit to Islamabad today. 
  During his visit, the Russian diplomat discussed the 
situation in the region, and particularly in Tajikistan, with 
President Faruq Leghari and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The 
Pakistani leaders said that Islamabad was ready to strain every 
effort so as to reduce tension on the Tajik border and to help

  [Text] Shanghai May 17 TASS -- "I was told that May will 
become a `Russian month' in China. I think there should also be 
a `Russian year' and a `Russian decade'," visiting Russian Duma 
Speaker Ivan Rybkin said here today. 
  "We can and must cooperate. Friendship with great neighbour 
China was created by many generations and it would be sinful to 
break it," Rybkin told ITAR-TASS after meeting Secretary of the 
Shanghai City Council of the Chinese Communist Party Wu Bangguo. 
  In the words of the Duma speaker, the official Chinese visit 
of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to begin next week 
will result in signing of several agreements, which are 
essentially important for the Russian economy. 
  The current visit of the Duma delegation aims to search for 
ways of bilateral cooperation. Despite the lack of time, the 
Russian parliament deputies have met Chinese Chairman and 
General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central 
Committee Jiang Zemin, Parliament Head Qiao Shi, Deputy State 
Council Premier Li Lanqing and Deputy Foreign Minister Tian 
Jiangpei. 
  The delegation is interested in the Chinese experience of 
economic reforms, stressed the Duma speaker. "When in Shanghai, 
a major industrial center of China, we saw that the most 
vulnerable layers are protected in the course of market reforms. 
People are sure of their future", he added. 
  In the opinion of Rybkin, the Chinese market can become a 
most promising for Russian businessmen. From 1.5 to two billion 
U.S. dollars are transferred from Russia abroad each month, much 
of this money is invested in inefficient real estate. This 
money could be better used in creation of Russian-Chinese 
ventures, he said. 
  "Thousands of Shanghai joint ventures include only four with 
participation of Russian capital. It is too small. I am 
convinced that Russian-Chinese ventures are promising," said the 
speaker. 
  "Being the law-makers, we will support all decisions aiming 
to develop Russian-Chinese cooperation," he said. 
  On the same day, Ivan Rybkin visited a Chinese major 
metallurgical plant of Baoshan and the vegetable-growing farm of 
Luodian. 
  After meeting the Chinese communist leader, the Duma speaker 
left for the Shenzhen economic zone in the Chinese south, which 
is considered to be a model of the Chinese economic reforms.

<F P=106> [Boris Reznik report: "Khabarovsk Kray Governor Calls for </F>
Denunciation of Border Agreement With China"; accompanied by 
IZVESTIYA PRESS SERVICE report citing Russian Federation Foreign 
Ministry staffer] 
  [Text] Khabarovsk Kray -- Viktor Ishayev, head of the 
Khabarovsk Kray Administration, has called the border agreement 
between Russia and China that was signed in May 1991 unfair and 
an infringement of Russian interests. This document, in his 
opinion, has not resolved the border problems that exist between 
our giant countries. 
  At a news conference Ishayev referred to "submerged reefs" 
that could create new problems in Russo-Chinese relations. For 
instance, Article 5 of the agreement claims that the border 
between China and Russia in navigable rivers runs down the 
center of the main channel, while in nonnavigable rivers it runs 
down the center of the river or the center of its main branch. 
And Article 4 prescribes that a joint demarcation commission 
should "determine in line with Article 5 of this agreement the 
ownership of islands...." 
  Russia could lose many valuable lands, Viktor Ishayev 
claims. 
In Maritime Kray alone China could gain around 1,000 hectares of 
fertile pastureland. The people of Khabarovsk are also put out, 
for instance, by this entry in Article 8 of the agreement: "The 
contracting parties agree that ships of various kinds, including 
warships, can sail from the Ussuri River into the Amur River 
past Khabarovsk and back again without let or hindrance...." 
Who would like foreign ships -- much less, warships -- to be 
sailing virtually in the city center?... The people of the Far 
East again find it impossible to come to terms with their 
Chinese neighbors' claims to the age-old Russian Bolshoy 
Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarov Islands. 
  The governor cited numerous examples of Chinese ships 
navigating our internal waters past Khabarovsk without let or 
hindrance. They often deviate from the main channel, enter 
other channels, take depth measurements, and photograph the area 
and installations. 
  IZVESTIYA PRESS SERVICE report: "Russian Foreign Ministry 
Disagrees" 
  "Press reports of statements from the head of the Khabarovsk 
Kray Administration denouncing the agreement on the eastern 
stretch of the border between Russia and China are of concern to 
us," IZVESTIYA has been told by a senior Russian Foreign 
Ministry official. He refrained from making a definitive 
assessment, citing the fact that his department does not have 
any accurate information on these statements by the 
administration head. "We are trying to corroborate the accuracy 
of these reports," the diplomat said. 
  The Foreign Ministry proceeds on the basis that the 1991 
agreement is a fair agreement based on generally accepted norms 
of international law -- specifically, on drawing the border in 
navigable rivers down the middle of the main channel, and in 
nonnavigable rivers down the middle of the river or its main 
branch. 
  The senior Foreign Ministry official asked for it to be 
clearly stressed that never before in history had the islands in 
the Amur and Ussuri Rivers been divided up between Russia and 
China by treaty. The specific ownership of the islands -- which 
is, indeed the reason why feelings are running high -- will be 
determined in the course of the border demarcation currently 
being carried out. 
  The Foreign Ministry can in no way share the administration 
head's indignation about the passage of Chinese ships in the 
Khabarovsk area. This is normal practice, the diplomat said, 
when foreign vessels enter our ports or internal waters. 
  The diplomat admitted, however, that regulations governing 
navigation have not yet been elaborated in line with the 
bilateral agreement. A Russian delegation comprising experts 
from different departments -- including the Amur River Shipping 
Company -- is currently holding talks with the Chinese on 
drawing up such regulations. Conclusion of this work will make 
it possible to avoid any complications or misunderstandings in 
the future, the diplomat said.

  [Text] Khabarovsk May 18 TASS -- The 12-day meeting of the 
joint Russo-Chinese commission for the demarcation of the border 
was rounded off here by the signing of a joint protocol. 
  "We did not tackle any territorial disputes during our 
negotiations, but merely fixed the borderline in keeping with 
earlier signed Russo-Chinese treaties," ITAR-TASS was told by 
Genrikh Kiriyev, roving ambassador and leader of the Russian 
delegation. "The adopted joint protocol reflects many problems 
linked with demarcation. We have studied very carefully the 
depth of border rivers. Not all the problems have been solved 
and the negotiations will be continued at the next session of 
the joint commission." 
  Kiriyev noted during a press conference here that he did not 
deem it possible to revise separate articles of the agreement 
concluded with the People's Republic of China in 1991 on the 
eastern stretch of the Russo-Chinese border, because their 
revision was tantamount to the revision of all the agreement. A 
denunciation of the agreement is also out of the question," he 
stated. 
  Asked about the future of the Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy and 
Tarabarov Islands near Khabarovsk, Kiriyev stressed: "We insist 
firmly and persistently that these islands belong to Russia. 
The population of the Amur region can rest assured that nobody 
wants to give up the islands." 
  The Russian delegation included representatives from the 
Foreign Ministry, the chief command of the Federal Borderguard 
Service, the Defence Ministry, and heads of the governing bodies 
of the border territories and regions of the Russian Far East.

  [Text] Moscow, 17 May -- While being in possession of 
powerful technologies and facilities for processing and 
recycling toxic waste, the West, nevertheless, prefers to export 
this waste to other countries in Africa, South America, East 
Europe, or the CIS, which do not have such facilities. This is 
not an economic move but a purposeful political action in order 
to save themselves from the harmful anthropogenic effects of the 
waste. The West sees Russia as the preferred candidate for a 
world garbage dump, Valeriy Timofeyev, representative of the 
Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service, said today at a 
meeting of the interdepartmental commission for ecological 
safety of the Russian Security Council. 
  Judging by the report made by Aleksey Poryadin, first deputy 
minister for the protection of environment and natural 
resources, there are causes for concern. Russia produces 
annually about 7,000 million tonnes of waste, of which only 
2,000 million (28 percent) are then used in the national 
economy. To date, 1,600 million tonnes of toxic waste have 
accumulated in the country. The situation that has come about 
in Russia with the formation, use, de-activation, storage, and 
burying of waste results in irreversible damage to the natural 
environment and poses a real threat to the health of Russian 
people. 
  Russia already has "waste storages" that can cause 
ecological 
catastrophes, but despite this, the import of foreign toxic 
substances to this country continues. There is an increasingly 
clear tendency to conclude deals on importing and recycling 
dangerous waste under the guise of foreign economic projects on 
recycling raw materials to extract valuable substances or on 
giving humanitarian aid.

  [Text] The International Affairs Committee of the Russian 
parliament's Federation Council expressed its concern over the 
unilateral lifting of the embargo against Bosnia by the U.S. 
Senate. In its Tuesday statement, made available to Interfax, 
the committee said that such steps could obstruct the joint 
Russian, U.S. and EU policy in Bosnia and said that weapons 
should not reach the warring parties. 
  The committee thought that as the Serbs complied with the 
peace plan the suspension and, at a later stage, lifting of the 
sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) would 
promote peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  The upper house deputies expressed their willingness to 
consult and act jointly with the U.S. senators in resolving the 
Bosnian crisis. 
  The State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, 
had earlier passed a resolution under which, if the embargo on 
weapons supplies to Bosnia were unilaterally lifted, Russia was 
to respond adequately, going as far as lifting its own sanctions.

  [Text] Moscow, 18 May -- The Federation Council will reject 
the 1994 budget approved by the State Duma. This prediction was 
made by Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. Speaking 
to correspondents today, he explained that this "will not be to 
spite the government or its prime minister, whom I hold in high 
esteem," but merely in the interests of Russia's regions. 
Vladimir Shumeyko disclosed that the chamber was actively 
discussing the reform program, and deputies do not agree with 
all its provisions. 
  The budget will be discussed with interregional economic 
associations. Vladimir Shumeyko said this was why the next 
session of the Federation Council was being postponed from 23 
May, the date originally scheduled, to 30 May. A number of 
questions connected with the economy have been proposed for the 
draft agenda.

  [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- Russian lawmakers have moved 
for inviting presidential parliament spokesman Aleksandr 
Yakovlev and Chairman of the Federation Council Vladimir 
Shumeyko to one of its forthcoming sessions to report on the 
situation inside the Russian procurator-general's office. 
  They expressed concern about the fact that in accordance 
with 
a presidential decree, all of the Russian procurator-general 
deputies had been dismissed and wanted to know the reasoning 
behind the decision. 
  Russian legislators also voted on Wednesday to invite head 
of 
presidential administration Sergey Filatov to a plenary session 
of the State Duma to answer to their inquiries related to 
President Yeltsin's letter in regard of the law on the status of 
a State Duma deputy, which he signed earlier. 
  They were dissatisfied with explanations which were offered 
by the chief of the Main Legal Department under the Russian 
president Ruslan Orekhov at a plenary session of the Duma last 
Friday.

  [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- One of the contenders of 
presidency in Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko, today called for 
unification of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus at a plenary session 
of the Russian State Duma. Given the floor by a majority 
decision in the Russian parliament's chamber he urged the three 
countries to set up a joint parliamentary group and to go to 
work on the documents, on the basis of which the three 
republics, which initiated the creation of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, will be able to reunify. 
  Lukashenko called that decision "a mistake made in December 
1991", which should be recognised as such. 
  Chairman of the Duma Committee for Commonwealth Affairs 
Konstantin Zatulin then proposed that a record be made in the 
minutes of the chamber's plenary meeting to the effect that the 
speech of the Belarusian colleague "in no way reflects the State 
Duma's position". 
  Russia's Choice also disavowed Lukashenko's statement. Its 
representative Boris Zolotukhin called for declaring 
Lukashenko's address to the Duma "inappropriate, as being 
directly connected with his presidential election campaigning". 
He recalled that according to parliamentary standards, the Duma 
can only be addressed by a representative of the official 
parliamentary delegation from Belarus.

  [Text] Elections for the Federation Council and the oblast 
Duma have been held in Chelyabinsk Oblast. A. Starikov, general 
director of the Magnitogorsk Metallurgy Combine joint-stock 
company, and Professor M. Isayev, a prominent Urals economist, 
were elected to the upper chamber of the Russian legislature. 
  Unfortunately, Army General V. Varennikov, Hero of the 
Soviet 
Union, who was nominated by the oblast's communists, could not 
garner the requisite number of votes. But the southern Urals' 
voters were wise enough to vote down the candidate of the 
extreme right -- Conservative Republican Party Chairman L. 
Ubozhko, a staunch anti-communist. 
  In the oblast Duma elections, supporters of the "For Urals 
Revival" opposition movement under P. Sumin, former Russian 
people's deputy and chairman of the oblast council, won a 
majority of votes. The oblast legislature will be clearly Soviet 
both in its lineup and its spirit.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Province" rubric: </F>
"Federation Council Promises `Equal Rights' to Regions. 
Associations Give Up State-Owned Status `Not To Expose 
Themselves'"] 
  [Text] A protocol of intentions has been signed with 
representatives of all eight Russian interregional associations 
-- Central Russia, the North-West, the Chernozem zone, the 
Siberian Accord, the Association of North Caucasian Krays and 
Oblasts, the Greater Volga, the Urals Regional Association, and 
the Far Eastern Association. According to Federation Council 
Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko, "the country's leaders have paid 
dearly for their misconception that authority is concentrated in 
Moscow alone." Mr. Shumeyko reaffirmed that from now on the 
federal authorities will see interregional associations as "an 
equal subject of regional politics and a participant in all 
talks." 
  The protocol that was signed calls for a cooperation treaty 
to be negotiated between the federal parliament and the 
associations, which, as the interregional association leaders 
expect, will be followed by the adoption of "a law on 
interregional cooperation" in which the associations will have a 
key role to play. Moreover, Vladimir Shumeyko hinted at the 
possibility of conferring "a state- legal status" on the 
associations. 
  The discussion on substance was held in strict secrecy from 
the press. 
  Aleksandr Danusiya, general director of the Central Russia 
association, told your SEGODNYA correspondent that "most 
association chiefs categorically opposed the proposal to finance 
them from the budget." "First, because this would necessitate 
accounting..." But the main reason for the interregional 
association chiefs' reluctance to assume "state status," 
Aleksandr Danusiya acknowledged, is that "one should not rush 
into the idea of enlarging the associations..." He is certain 
that "the associations are a prototype of a future management 
structure, but when they can become such -- in 10-15 years or in 
two years -- will depend on the situation..." 
  However, even at this stage interregional association 
leaders 
call themselves "the sole body that can coordinate and actually 
implement all decisions on the ground." For instance, according 
to Anatoliy Dolgolaptev, coordinator of the Council of 
Interregional Associations, "the adoption of the 1993 
privatization program was delayed so long precisely because we 
disagreed with it, and it was finally passed only after 
appropriate amendments were made." 
  The Federation Council speaker is so far inclined to take a 
fairly ironical view on the possible evolution of interregional 
associations into government structures. If Federation 
components are enlarged and the 89 components are merged into 
eight (according to the current number of associations), then 
the Federation Council will consist of only 16 members, and it 
will be easier to work with them," [quotation marks as 
published] Shumeyko joked at a news conference after the 
protocol was signed, noting, however, that "this joke may have a 
grain of truth in it."

Tuesday [17 May]. 
  During the meeting, which lasted a little over 30 minutes,

and especially to make it clear that Russia seeks to carry out 
its interests through Kaliningrad," Slezevicius told reporters 
after the meeting. 
  The Lithuanian premier said he also asked the French 
Government to assist Lithuania in its efforts to get integrated 
with European economic structures. 
  Slezevicius and an accompanying Lithuanian Government 
delegation arrived in Paris Tuesday for meetings with 
top-ranking French officials and to attend a World Bank 
conference devoted to the Baltic states. 
  On the first day of their stay in Paris, Lithuanian

  [Text] Vilnius, May 17, BNS -- The U.S. Department of 
Defense and the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense intend to sign a 
memorandum on defense cooperation already this year, according 
to the results of talks held in Vilnius Monday [16 May]. 
  Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius said he 
expects 
the memorandum to serve as a basis for other documents that 
would define specific forms of defense cooperation, including 
acquisition of weapons by Lithuania. 
  The assistant U.S. secretary of defense for regional 
security 
affairs, Charles Freeman, said the memorandum, which is under 
preparation, provides for wide-ranging cooperation and expressed 
hope that Lithuania and the United States will smoothly approach 
its signing. 
  At a press conference in Vilnius Monday, Freeman said the 
United States intends to sign similar accords with all countries 
in East and Central Europe, except a majority of former Soviet 
republics. The official said the fact that the Baltics are 
offered such cooperation witnesses the continuity of a policy 
according to which the United States never formally recognized 
the annexation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by the Soviets 
in 1940. 
  U.S. and Lithuanian delegations, headed by Linkevicius and 
Freeman, met Monday to discuss possibilities for closer defense 
cooperation, as well as to exchange views on the preparation of 
Lithuania's "Partnership for Peace" presentation document, the 
defense doctrine, the national security concept and the creation 
of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion. Both delegations met with 
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas. 
  U.S. experts gave a positive evaluation of Lithuania's 
defense doctrine, the national security concept and the 
partnership presentation document. Linkevicius said the latter 
document should be submitted to NATO for consideration May 25. 
The U.S. delegation welcomed the Baltic peacekeeping battalion 
initiative. 
  Freeman said the U.S. Congress is expected to decide soon on 
assistance to peacekeeping initiatives in East and Central 
Europe. He said the U.S. Government wants to see political, 
economic and defensive integration of the Baltic states into 
transatlantic systems. As regards Lithuania national defense 
system, Freeman said the country made a step forward and 
continues to move in the right direction.

<F P=106> [Report by Ruta Skatikaite: "The Choice of the Ignalina </F>
Nuclear Station"] 
  [Text] A competition on the dismantling of the third block 
at the Ignalina nuclear power station has ended. Following its 
announcement of the competition, the nuclear station was visited 
by representatives of enterprises from Vilnius, Jonava, and 
Panevezys. Several German and Norwegian firms also expressed 
interest in this venture. Foreigners immediately refused the 
structure of the third block, because, in their opinion, its 
dismantlement would require additional government assignations. 
From among the Lithuanian enterprises, the station chose the 
trade stock company "Lina." The latter has already concluded 
agreements with construction and transportation organizations in 
Visaginas. "Lina" was not daunted by the most difficult 
condition of the competition -- to dismantle the block at its 
own cost. 
  The Ignalina nuclear power station has passed on information 
concerning the results of the competition to the government, 
which will have to decide whether or not to allow "Lina" to 
dismantle the third block.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Ardayev: "New Kazakhstani Parliament: </F>
Drama or Farce?"] 
  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- It may be that the current 
process of reform of the legislature in Kazakhstan will go down 
in history as something of an enigmatic phenomenon. Let me 
remind readers that, unlike Russia, Kazakhstan has done without 
tanks and rallying crowds, but immediately after the October 
events in Moscow an "epidemic" of self-disbandment suddenly 
broke out in Kazakhstan, affecting soviets at all levels -- from 
village soviets right up to the Supreme Soviet -- and witnessed 
the sudden demise of the latter. The president and government 
categorically rejected suspicions that they were somehow 
involved in this process, even though its organized character 
left no room for any such doubt. So then, to use the well-known 
aphorism of Red Army man Sukhov, "the East is a subtle thing...." 
  In mid-December the Supreme Soviet ceased to exist, having 
transferred its legislative powers to the president and 
scheduled elections for a new supreme legislative organ of power 
for the beginning of March; this new body was conceived as a 
compact parliament (177 deputies, two fewer than in the former 
Supreme Soviet) working on a professional basis. President N. 
Nazarbayev himself described the significance and purpose of 
what had happened in the clearest terms: The Supreme Soviet, 
which had basically been elected during a different historical 
period and which contained all the old party nomenklatura, from 
the head shepherd to the rayon committee secretary, had outlived 
its usefulness, just like Soviet power itself with its arcane 
system of soviets at all levels. What was needed was a united 
and integrated legislative organ capable of single-mindedly and 
competently providing a legal base for the reforms policy in 
Kazakhstan. 
  It is hardly worth describing in detail all the ups and 
downs 
of the elections which have just taken place. Alternative 
political forces contested seats in parliament on a legal basis 
for the first time, but realistically the opposition's 
opportunities during the elections were extremely limited. 
Consequently the parliamentary majority was made up of deputies 
from the so-called "state list," i.e. deputies nominated by the 
president and the government in conjunction with representatives 
of the National Unity Alliance, the political organization 
supporting the president. Generally speaking, practically the 
entire new parliament is yet again made up of people from the 
nomenklatura. Some 90 percent of the deputies are leaders of 
various kinds of government, state, and quasi-state structures: 
Ministries and departments, local administrations, state 
enterprises, kolkhozes and sovkhozes, law-enforcement organs, 
and so forth. The president has gotten what he knows to be a 
loyal parliament, whose objective qualities, however, mean that 
it is able to act as a kind of hidden opposition, if not to the 
president himself then at least to the reforms policy he is 
pursuing. 
  Meanwhile, the "open" political opposition which finds 
itself 
in a definite minority is making its presence felt in vocal 
fashion. Some 15 parties and social organizations of various 
stripes -- communists and socialists, social democrats, national 
patriots and the Slav movement "Harmony," which opposes them -- 
have joined forces and established the "Republic" coordinating 
council headed by S. Abdildin, former speaker of the 
self-disbanded Supreme Soviet. "Republic" has proclaimed a 
course of establishing a "constructive opposition" in parliament 
and has declared its objective to be the formulation and 
protection of a program to ensure Kazakhstan's survival -- in 
the opinion of coordinating council members, the state is going 
to rack and ruin: Its economy is collapsing, the population has 
been brought to the brink of penury, and the political reforms 
are leading to the establishment of a dictatorship. 
  [Text] Although familiar communist terminology 
predominates in the opposition's statements and their panicky 
tone clearly betrays the desire of political failures to have 
their revenge, as is so often the case there is no smoke without 
fire -- the socioeconomic and domestic political situation in 
Kazakhstan is indeed becoming more and more worrying. Since the 
second half of last year, when illusions about the possibility 
of preserving the ruble area came crashing down and Kazakhstan 
set about introducing its own national currency, its economy has 
gone into a steep dive. The decline in production has 
accelerated and the number of enterprises that have either 
stopped working or are working on minimum capacity is nearing 
the critical mark -- according to official statistical data, by 
the start of this year alone 732 enterprises and organizations 
with a total workforce of over 350,000 people had stopped work 
either partially or completely. And the situation is steadily 
worsening. The payments deficit is growing, and this year there 
are plans to cover it exclusively by means of loans from 
international organizations. 
  The commodity production crisis is in turn whipping up 
inflation in the young Kazakhstani currency. The speed of 
inflationary processes is growing -- during the six months it 
has been in existence, the tenge has seen its value fall six 
times, i.e. average monthly inflation has reached the 
100-percent mark. In this respect the new currency has already 
outdone the old. Even the old-style ruble, which was withdrawn 
from circulation in Russia last August and which Kazakhstan 
continued to use until mid-November, did not plunge so rapidly 
at first. 
  The government has not only failed to take any measures to 
achieve monetary stabilization, it has even taken extremely some 
illogical steps which have actually exacerbated the inflationary 
situation. It has no choice in the matter, however: Its 
budgetary resources for keeping prices in check are exhausted. 
At the same time the increase in prices has not only become 
evidence but also a cause of the devaluation of the national 
currency, and the process has acquired an avalanche-like and 
uncontrollable character. It is a vicious circle: Each new 
fall in the tenge's exchange rate provokes a price hike, 
including an increase in the price of energy sources, which in 
turn jacks up the price of goods and services even more, which 
in turn fuels the next inflationary spiral.... 
  The president's staff and the government are not shouldering 
the budget expenditure cuts themselves. A decision made 
recently by N. Nazarbayev to separate the presidential and the 
Cabinet of Ministers staffs demonstrates on the one hand that 
the head of state is as it were dissociating himself from the 
activity of the government he heads, which is likely to result 
in the rapid replacement of its leadership -- this was also 
confirmed by N. Nazarbayev's speech at the first session of 
parliament in which he was sharply critical of the Cabinet of 
Ministers, saddling it with the blame for exacerbating the 
crisis processes. On the other hand, however, the separation of 
the two staffs means their duplication, and consequently the 
duplication of expenditure on officials' pay, which is already 
fairly substantial. 
  Attempts are being made to cut expenditure, but squarely at 
the population's expense. The decision of the president and the 
government at the start of the year to abolish all previously 
established social benefits and replace them with monetary 
compensation caused a furor -- within the space of a month in 
inflationary conditions these compensatory amounts had turned 
into something like alms. When thousands of elderly people 
organized a noisy rally outside the parliament building on the 
opening day of the first session of parliament, N. Nazarbayev 
issued an edict reinstating the benefits -- but only for the 
disabled ex-servicemen and war veterans. Invalid children and 
workers and similarity disabled people continued to be deprived 
of their benefits. For example, a blind person is currently 
obliged to buy a streetcar ticket, and someone without the use 
of his legs must pay his phone bill in full and fill up his car 
with gasoline at the standard, very expensive price. Another 
example: Under the president's edict, the new arrangements, 
which have only just been adopted regarding taxation of 
individuals' income even envisage levying income tax 
on...unemployment benefit. 
  As far as income itself is concerned, by the time the 
session 
started its work the president's edict had stipulated that the 
minimum wage and old-age pension in the Republic should be 
increased by 150 percent to 100 tenge a month -- even according 
to official exchange rates when the edict was published this 
does not even amount to $5 or 9,000 Russian rubles. This is the 
minimum. Accordance to the government codes, the maximum cannot 
exceed 10 minimums.... Despite price levels that are no lower 
than in Russia. 
  Basically, ever since the Republic's Executive Branch has 
subsumed the Legislative Branch, the situation has significantly 
worsened. A whole tangle of problems does in fact require 
competent and major intervention. Of course, it is laughable to 
hope that the advent of a new parliament -- however strong it 
might be -- would in itself be able to change anything right 
away, but at any rate there is a chance that skilled collegial 
revision by the deputies of the situation that has developed and 
the activity of the government and president, and their 
corrections to that activity, could inspire hope of finding a 
way out of the crisis. On one condition, of course -- provided 
parliament turns out as it was intended: A competent and 
professional legislative organ. 
  The start of the first session's work exceeded all 
expectations. First of all, the parliamentary leadership is 
mainly composed of representatives of the president's "team." 
The 55-year-old journalist, writer, and experienced ideological 
worker Abish Kekilbayev was elected speaker; in the Kazakhstan 
Communist Party Central Committee he was head of the Interethnic 
Relations Department, and recently he has worked as a state 
counselor in charge of the same issues in the government. 
  Second, as is normally the case, parliament began with 
organizational questions. The work was thorough -- 10 days of 
work were required to elect leaders, to form commissions and 
committees, and also to examine issues regarding backup for the 
deputies' activities. 
  Following heated debates, the deputies awarded themselves 
ministers' salaries with a 50-percent additional amount to cover 
expenses connected with performing their deputies' duties, 
despite having ensured that many communal services such as 
transportation and communications are provided for them free of 
charge. In addition, they enjoy official apartments, personal 
cars, free removal expenses enabling 120 deputies to relocate to 
accommodations in the capital, health benefit in the form of a 
lump sum equivalent to two months' salary, and individual 
offices.... And when the initial stage of the first session of 
the new parliament had finished, the deputies dispersed for six 
weeks' vacation. 
  The second round of the session opens 13 May. It is hard to 
make any precise predictions as to what it will be like, but 
judging by the results of the first round, the president and 
government's hopes of forming a loyal parliament in Kazakhstan 
composed of state functionaries who are experienced in their 
work have been completely realized: They have gotten what they 
wanted, so to speak. 
  If everything subsequently follows the same scenario, it is 
not hard to predict how events will develop. In conditions of 
virtual one-man rule by the president (and hence one-man 
responsibility), when the domestic political and socioeconomic 
situation deteriorates further it will not be an effective 
solution simply to replace the government cabinet. Taking new 
and unpopular measures at a time when living standards are 
steadily worsening and problems of an irreversible nature are 
cropping up (stoppages by more and more enterprises and 
increased unemployment owing to the fact that practically no new 
jobs are being created) could provoke a negative reaction among 
more and more sections of the population. And this could fuel 
an increase in the prestige of opposition structures -- as has 
already happened in Russia, where V. Zhirinovskiy's fascist 
party "unexpectedly" achieved a majority at the polls. Another 
danger faces Kazakhstan in this respect: Either political 
forces of a pro-communist stripe will come to power, or, more 
likely, the present executive branch will strengthen its 
position little by little until it establishes a real 
dictatorship. Both alternatives are equally unpalatable.

  [Summary] The production output of the agricultural 
machine-building concern, Aktyubinskselmash, is 62 percent of 
the output from the same period last year. The main cause of 
its trouble is insolvency of its partners both in Kazakhstan and 
the CIS states.

  [Text] Dushanbe 17 May TASS -- A powerful missile attack 
was launched today on the 11th post of the Moskovskiy 
borderguard unit, guarding the Tajik-Afghan border. The attack, 
launched both from the territory of Afghanistan, controlled by 
General Kozi Kobir's 55th Afghan Infantry Division, and from 
mojaheed positions in the rear of the Russian borderguards, 
lasted from 0800 to 1100. The enemy gun emplacements were 
smashed by Russian retaliatory blows. There were no casualties 
among Russian servicemen. The losses of the Tajik opposition 
have not been reported, ITAR-TASS learned today from military 
sources in Dushanbe. 
  It was stressed in this connection that the irreconcilable 
Tajik opposition, entrenched in the northern provinces of 
Afghanistan, became active again from 15-17 May. Several of its 
attempts to break through the positions of the Moskovskiy and 
Pyanj borderguard detachments were thwarted. The redeployment 
of armed groups of militants, supporting the Islam movement for 
the revival of Tajikistan, from the Hunduz and Tahor provinces 
of Afghanistan to the Afghan part of Badakhshan is continuing. 
Some of the armed groups are being massed opposite the 
Shuroabad sector of the Tajik-Afghan border, near the positions 
of the Moskovskiy borderguard unit, and the others -- in the 
immediate proximity of the Pamir sector of the border. 
  According to a trustworthy military source in Dushanbe, the 
purpose of these redeployments is to break through into 
districts, bordering on the Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous region 
of Tajikistan, in order to launch further operations against the 
government forces of the Republc. The source said that all 
these attempts were futile. The Russian borderguards and the 
national defence forces of the republic have taken additional 
effctive measures to strengthen the Tajik-Afghan border and the 
highland areas of the Republic adjoining it.

framework and in other international organizations for the sake 
of peace and security in the world, the document stated. 
  According to the document, Uzbekistan has pledged to 
contribute to ensure stability in central Asia, and also carry

Uzbekistan, together with his wife Tatyana Akbarovna and 
accompanying officials, has arrived in Tokyo on an official 
visit. This is the first-ever top-level contact between Japan 
and Uzbekistan -- previously this country simply did not exist. 
  He is the third president from the former Soviet expanses of 
Central Asia to visit Japan in the last few months. The season 
was opened by the visit to Tokyo by Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] President 
Askar Akayev in April last year; this April saw the arrival of 
Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
  The Uzbek leader's itinerary is one of sightseeing tours, 
although it is also replete with the necessary and traditional 
protocol events -- a reception and dinner with the emperor, 
short talks, and lunch with the prime minister. There is a 
meeting with business circles, and a long and varied tour of the 
sights. In fact, the working part of Karimov's four-day visit 
to Japan is essentially restricted to one event. Bilateral 
contacts have so far been scanty, and there is virtually nothing 
of substance to talk about. 
  The Japanese knew in advance that the guest would be asking 
for money and other aid in various forms, while talking about 
the Republic's potential wealth. Incidentally, everyone 
willingly recognizes Uzbekistan's raw-materials potential, but 
there seems to be some hesitation about providing material 
confirmation of this in the form of investment, loans, and 
participation in joint-venture projects. Several Japanese 
business delegations have visited Uzbekistan of late, studying 
market conditions and assessing Uzbekistan's potential to meet 
Japanese requirements -- but no large-scale program for Japanese 
participation in boosting Uzbekistan has yet been arranged. Of 
course, the first-ever visit to Tokyo by an Uzbek president will 
not go unmarked, and there will be some economic "souvenirs" to 
take away, but people in the know believe that the 
Japanese-Uzbek dialogue during the summit trip will probably not 
go beyond symbolism. It is believed behind the scenes in Tokyo 
that the phrases "it is important to start small and not rush" 
and "a long journey begins with a single step" will be to the 
fore in the upcoming Japanese-Uzbek talks. 
  The Japanese media are preparing their audience in their own 
way for the important Uzbek guest's visit. Thus, for instance, 
the newspaper ASAHI featured a long article by Yusuke Matsuzaki, 
who is the senior and the only Japanese adviser to the Uzbek 
Vneshekonombank [Foreign Economic Bank]. The adviser openly 
notes that in the run-up to his pension he was looked upon as 
"unnecessary garbage" in Japan, but in Uzbekistan he can still 
show what he is capable of at age 60. The adviser talks about 
the promising plan to produce teflon frying pans in Uzbekistan 
with Turkish assistance, and writes about loans from the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, on whose 
distribution the Uzbek Vneshekonombank is currently working. 
Another newspaper -- MAINICHI -- published a leader to mark 
Karimov's arrival, reporting on Uzbekistan's natural resources, 
its proximity to Turkey, and the fact that it is important for 
Japan to correctly develop relations with the former Soviet 
Central Asia. And the newspaper noted that, although diplomacy 
should be determined by cool calculation and proceed on the 
basis of Japan's own interests, in the case of Central Asia in 
general and Uzbekistan in particular they should make allowances 
and permit a bit of romance to enter the equation. The romance, 
in MAINICHI's opinion, lies in the fact that Uzbekistan lies 
astride the old "Silk Road" -- so expanding the dialogue with it 
will be romantic and touching.

<F P=106> [Report by Marina Lebedeva: "Human Rights Conference Not </F>
Yet Open, But Arrests of Participants Already Under Way. These 
Are Being Carried Out by Uzbek Militia on the Territory of 
Sovereign Kazakhstan"] 
  [Text] The international conference on human rights 
organized by the Russian-American Bureau for Human Rights will 
start work in Alma-Ata [Almaty] 17 May. But at least two 
invitees will not be taking part; they are Talib Yakubov and 
Vasilya Inoyatova, activists of the Uzbek people's movement 
Birlik. 
  Yakubov was arrested in the apartment of relatives 10 May. 
Vasilya Inoyatova, whose name is still on many people's lips 
over last year's trial (she was accused of impugning the honor 
and dignity of President Karimov by her poetry) was arrested 
while still on Kazakhstani territory, in the settlment of 
Chernyayevka, 12 May. 
  The car in which Inoyatova was traveling was stopped by 
pursuing Zhigulis. Inoyatova and those accompanying her were 
taken to the city militia administration in Tashkent where they 
underwent a five-hour interrogation, conducted by Deputy Chief 
Khudaybergenov. All, except Inoyatova, were released with a 
warning to sever all links with members of Birlik. 
  Reports about the arrests of Yakubov and Inoyatina came from 
the U.S. human rights organization Helsinki Watch and the 
Society for the Defense of Human Rights in Central Asia. 
  After reporting these arrests, human rights campaigners 
noted 
that there has recently been a growing number of unlawful 
actions by the Uzbek militia and special services on the 
territory of other sovereign states, the authorities of which 
are taking no serious measures whatsoever. Last year, at the 
end of a similar conference, Abdumannov Pulatov, the well-known 
defender of human rights from Uzbekistan, was picked up right in 
front of the Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] militia. He was saved from prison 
only thanks to the intervention of human rights workers of many 
countries, journalists, and statesmen from the United States. 
  The Uzbek writer Yadgar Obid has been beaten up twice in 
Moscow in the last six months; however, the culprits have not 
been caught or punished. 
  So what, then, can the participants in the conference in 
Alma-Ata expect? Will they be able to discuss the theoretical 
problems connected with human rights or will they in practice 
have to defend their own rights straightaway, as it were? 
Yesterday we received a new report: Another two people invited 
to the conference, Mikhail Ardzinov, deputy chairman of a human 
rights society, and Mamura Usmanova, chairman of the Society of 
Free Women, Tumaris, have been arrested in Tashkent.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo 18 May TASS -- President Islam Karimov of 
Uzbekistan declined to comment on press reports about the arrest 
by Uzbek police of Talib Yakubov and Vasiliy Inoyatova, 
activists of the popular movement Birlik in Uzbekistan. 
Replying to an ITAR-TASS question at a press conference in 
Tokyo the president said he has "no knowledge about these 
persons," and added that "this question is not in the 
president's competence." 
  According to press reports, the arrested activists were 
expected to take part in the international conference on human 
rights organised by the Russian American human rights bureau in 
Alma-Ata [Almaty], Kazakhstan. Russian Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Grigoriy Kerasin announced on Tuesday [17 May] that in 
its relations with all foreign countries, including commonwealth 
member-states Russia would defending the activity of all human 
rights organisations as a necessary condition of the normal 
functioning of any democratic society. [sentence as received] 
  "If the arrest reports are true to fact, it will be 
necessary 
to find out to what degree this conform to the provisions of the 
Commonwealth Charter and the CIS Declaration of Human Rights, as 
well as to relevant documents of the United Nations and the 
Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe which provide 
for the strict observance of human rights and freedoms," the 
Russian official said. 
  As concerns political freedoms in Uzbekistan, President 
Islam 
Karimov told ITAR-TASS that "all political parties which now 
exist in Uzbekistan will take part in the forthcoming 
parliamentary elections in December. The law on elections which 
we have promulgated has successfully passed critical assessment 
in the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the 
United Nations. 
  On Islamic fundamentalism, Islam Karimov declared that 
Tashkent is "fully aware of the danger it poses to Uzbekistan. 
We are categorically against any ideological expansion, 
including in the form of Islamic fundamentalism," the president 
pointed out. "We see a safeguard against the pressure on the 
part of the champions of Moslem fundamentalism in integrating 
Uzbekistan as soon as possible in the world community of 
democratic states," he stressed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Pavlov, chief of the Council of </F>
Ministers Office for Coordinating the Activities of 
Administrative Bodies, by A. Makarov; place and date not given: 
"I Believe in 'The Good Hereafter' of the Belarusian Armed 
Forces"] 
  [Text] Not long ago, the State Secretariat for Fighting 
Crime and National Security was transformed into the Council of 
Ministers Office for Coordinating the Activities of 
Administrative Bodies. The very fact of this transformation as 
well as tasks facing the newly formed structure have already 
been discussed in the Belarusian press. Our correspondent has 
asked Chief of the Office Valeriy Pavlov to speak on the steps 
planned by the government to eliminate the difficulties that 
worry the people in uniforms. 
  [Pavlov] A normative act is to be adopted soon stipulating 
that those servicemen who served 20 or more years in the Army 
receive apartments while in active service. While this used to 
be a mere wish and a kind of declaration by both the Council of 
Ministers and the Defense Ministry, we now believe that this 
declaration should be provided with a legal footing. To achieve 
this goal, housing construction will be continued at the expense 
of the government and will involve foreign investments; credits 
will be granted to retired officers. The 9 billion rubles 
obtained from selling surplus arms will also be spent on 
implementation of the housing program for servicemen in 1994. 
  Aside from this, as we all know, compensations for food 
rations were increased as of 15 April. In May, the office will 
draft a resolution on changing salaries paid for military ranks. 
The government has requested that we review the issues of 
medical care, improve the norms of servicemen's allowances of 
food and clothing. 
  [Makarov] Nevertheless the planned measures will hardly 
bring our living standards close to those in the neighboring 
states. 
  [Pavlov] It is hard to compare the economic situations in 
Belarus and Russia -- the comparison would definitely be to our 
disadvantage. However despite this, the state is doing 
everything in its might for the Army. 
  I do not deny that we still have certain officials who tend 
to compare incomparable things. For example they suggest 
replacing two or three regiment exercises with personnel work in 
the economic sector. One should understand that every man and 
every state structure should be engaged in their business. If 
we stop holding exercises and reduce the scope of planned combat 
training, the Belarusian Army will change likewise. 
  [Makarov] How do you treat those forces in the Republic that 
promise to pour riches from "the horn of plenty" as soon as they 
come to power? 
  [Pavlov] I would ask them to answer just one question: How 
are they going to finance those promises? Unfortunately there 
is no source other than the state budget. The latter, 
incidentally, has its limits. 
  [Makarov] Speaking of the eternal sore point -- that of 
money -- what should the Armed Forces expect from the 
unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus? 
  [Pavlov] The unification of monetary systems will allow us 
to maximally integrate our efforts in the spheres of military 
construction, material supplies for the Army, and improvement of 
our scientific research. The current artificial exchange rate 
of Belarusian and Russian rubles does not permit carrying out 
these strategic tasks. Moreover, defense enterprises are 
overstocked and their products are not competitive because of 
excessive prices. 
  Of course, we will receive a real chance to more easily 
rearm 
and re-equip the Belarusian Army; more servicemen will acquire 
rare professions in Russia. A decrease in prices for power 
resources will provide for full implementation of the program 
for combat training of troops. 
  [Makarov] However the Republic's Armed Forces are comprised 
of people who suffer many hardships.... 
  [Pavlov] This is why immediately upon joining the single 
ruble zone, the wages of Belarusian officers will be reviewed. 
The wages of our officers will not be lower than those of 
Russian ones. We will also try to correct certain drawbacks 
that we have in the system of payments for the military. It is 
no secret how insignificant is the difference in wages paid for 
military ranks and jobs. Very often officers working with 
personnel are paid the same salaries as those who do not have to 
occupy themselves with test-range exercises or spend nights in 
the barracks. We are going to suggest that those officers who 
have commanded subunits ranging from company to division for a 
long time are paid certain bonuses. 
  We will also review post differentials for servicemen on 
combat duty, servicemen who serve far from oblast cities, under 
difficult conditions, in remote units. Of course, we will not 
have differentials similar to those paid in the Far East or in 
polar regions simply because there are no places with similar 
conditions here in Belarus, but salaries of the military will be 
targeted for review. 
  [Makarov] When will people feel the tangible results of 
all this? The transition to the ruble zone may take a long time. 
  [Pavlov] We have already gotten down to work and have 
completed some 30 percent of it. In fact, two out of our four 
departments have been "shoveling" Belarusian and Russian legal 
acts dealing with officer service, comparing, and thoroughly 
analyzing them. Everything that depends on us, we are doing 
right now. 
  [Makarov] Once the monetary systems are unified, will 
officers going abroad on vacation be entitled to travel 
allowances, as was the case in the past? 
  [Pavlov] An agreement between the Belarusian and Russian 
Defense Ministries is being prepared for signing, in accordance 
with which Belarusian servicemen will be entitled to travel 
allowances on the territories of ruble zone states. We should 
keep in mind that more than 35 percent of our officers and 
warrant officers have relatives in Russia. The system of 
treatment in recuperation and holiday centers will also be 
reviewed. 
  [Makarov] Speaking at the Baranovichi House of Culture on 3 
May, Stanislaw Shushkevich said that retired officers had not 
created material wealth, while the share of their pensions in 
the total pension fund, unlike the share of civilians' pensions, 
is incommensurably higher than their contribution. According to 
Shushkevich, Russia should pay pensions to the retired officers 
who used to serve in the Soviet Army. How would you comment on 
this? 
  [Pavlov] I believe that those statements do not deserve any 
comment. To know all the hardships of military service one 
should move with his family thousands of kilometers to new 
places of service every couple of years and be the only 
breadwinner in his family. Army life should not be discussed at 
meetings held at breweries. 
  Unfortunately, a majority of our politicians regard the 
liquidation of the Army and revision of bonuses for the military 
as the primary way to increase people's welfare. 
  [Makarov] But frankly, do you believe that our Army will be 
strengthened and that it has a future? Officers seek 
termination of service, graduates of military colleges prefer 
civilian life. 
  [Pavlov] Not only do I believe in the good hereafter of the 
Army. I am sure that the Belarusian Armed Forces will manage to 
overcome the current problems. The state will spare no efforts 
to support its defenders and make military service a respected 
profession. There are all grounds for such optimism. The point 
is that the forming of an economic union with Russia and the 
signing of the CIS collective security treaty permit a cardinal 
revision of the issues of the development of the Belarusian 
Army. The implementation of these documents will put an end to 
the Army's self-isolation, which in fact amounted to continual 
degradation. The issues of developing military science, 
supplying the Army with modern equipment, training of personnel, 
and many others will be resolved on the basis of integration 
with Russia, proceeding from the unity of defense interests. As 
early as this summer, as stipulated by an appropriate agreement, 
Belarusian formations and air-defense units will have a chance 
to hold field firing and intensive training of gun squads at 
Russian test-ranges. 
  I am fully confident that the fate of our Army -- just as 
our 
economy, our people, and all of Belarus -- depends on how fully 
we are able to restore what we have thoughtlessly ruined. A 
union with Russia gives us a chance to do this. It is sad that 
the candidates for Belarusian president do not seem to 
understand this.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Kovalev: "Belarusian Missile Workers </F>
Hope To Conduct Field Firing in Russia"] 
  [Text] For two years now, units and subdivisions of the 
Belorussian [Belarusian] Army Air Defense Force, which are 
equipped with long-range antiaircraft missile complexes, have 
been deprived of an opportunity to make combat launches. There 
are no corresponding test sites on the Republic's territory. 
When there was just one army, Belorussian Air Defense units 
went to testing grounds in Russia. Yet since the 
"nationalization" of armies the road there has been closed. 
  According to Lt.-Gen. Valeriy Kostenko, commander in chief 
of 
the Belorussian Air Defense Force, this summer Belorussian 
missile workers can again practice combat firing in Russia. Our 
countries, he said, do not intend to destroy the integral air 
defense system.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 13/5/1994 -- The threefold 
increase in prices for utilities was made "without the 
Government taking efficient measures for paying the salary 
arrears and before revising the minimum salary," states the 
protest signed by a group of Moldovan trade unions. The protest 
demands suspension of the decision on raising utilities prices; 
otherwise the trade unions "will mobilize people to protest in 
front of the government building" and proceed to more energetic 
protest actions such as a manifestation in the Great National 
Assembly Square in Chisinau. The presidium of the Federation of 
Independent Trade Unions (FITU) issued today a similar protest 
saying that the increase of the utilities prices is nothing "but 
a mockery." The FITU "demands immediate suspension of the 
decisions on increasing these prices" and adds that "ignoring 
these demands will provoke social instability." Sources from 
the Federation say that the FITU Presidium had to make this 
decision under the pressure of several branch trade unions. 
Previously, the FITU had launched the idea of abstaining for 
six month from protest actions. Today, during the press 
conference of the Moldovan Agrarian Democratic Party, Moldovan 
deputy speaker Dumitru Motpan stated that measures have already 
been taken to suspend the implementation of the increased 
tariffs.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau, 17 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Fearing a social 
explosion, the Moldovan Cabinet today suspended for ten days a 
local authority decision to increase the cost of municipal 
services. It was decided last week to increase these almost 
threefold. 
  One of the main reasons was Moldova's chronic indebtedness 
for fuels imported from Russia and other CIS countries. The 
republican federation of independent trade unions sharply 
criticized the price rises, with the federation's leaders 
threatening to organize mass demonstrations. Trade union 
leaders say that the majority of the population today cannot pay 
for housing and services even at the old prices, and can hardly 
make ends meet because of growing unemployment and low wages. 
  Within the next 10 days a government commission hopes to 
find 
a way out of the situation, though this very day the government 
informed citizens that Moldova owes the Russian Federation 
Gasprom joint-stock company about 200 billion rubles for gas 
alone.

<F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Feliksova: "Moldavia Enters CIS Amid </F>
Screams From Opposition"] 
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] -- Moldavia [Moldova] has 
entered the CIS amid screams from the opposition about the loss 
of independence and a new form of imperial oppression. But the 
opposition can hardly now exert influence on the decisions 
adopted by the ruling Agrarian majority. Especially since 
everyone is aware that the people who are screaming most loudly 
about the loss of the republic's independence are those who are 
least interested in it. They are mainly people who favor 
unification with Romania and who regard Moldavia's joining the 
CIS as another major obstacle to realizing their secret dream. 
  However, the question of the CIS should not be viewed solely 
in black and white. It is far more complex. Among its 
opponents are also people who are not dying to join Romania, but 
who are afraid that a powerful country like Russia will dictate 
its political and economic will and turn Moldavia into a 
satellite. "That is the mentality of small countries," I was 
told by economist A. Muravskiy, an Agrarian deputy. "They 
differ from large countries in their pathological sensitivity to 
any encroachment on their rights." 
  The so-called "Westerners," seeking a panacea to all ills in 
the opposite direction to the east, also take a suspicious view 
of the CIS. But many economists believe that the Republic will 
be unable to break into the Western market in the near future. 
For instance, during the first two months of the year imports 
from the wider world were quadruple the amount of exports. 
Moreover, the bulk of the deliveries were paid for in hard 
currency. 
  Paradoxically enough, it is easier for Moldavia to get 
closer 
to the West via the eastern market. Experts think that Western 
investors regard it as a kind of bridge in that direction. So, 
however you look at it, the CIS may be a case of bleak or 
longed-for necessity, but necessity nonetheless. 
  Based on the results of the first two months of the year 
Moldavia's foreign trade turnover with CIS countries totaled 
around 75 percent, with Russia remaining the main player. It 
accounts for almost 62 percent, followed by Ukraine (8.5 
percent) and Belorussia [Belarus] (2.3 percent). But here too 
the balance of trade is by no means in Moldavia's favor. 
Imports exceed exports by 137 million leu, of which gas 
shipments from the Russian Federation make up the lion's share. 
  Joining the CIS means hope for Moldavia -- according to the 
corresponding article of the treaty -- of freer movement of 
goods, services, money, and manpower, coordinated money-credit 
and tax policy, and more acceptable customs duties.... 
  However, what is for some people a long-awaited and for 
others an unwanted decision will not per se instantaneously ease 
the situation. That is already clear to even the staunchest 
supporters of the Commonwealth -- people who have gotten over 
the period of naive romanticism, when it was thought that all 
that was needed was to sign the treaty and the economic wheel 
would turn toward stabilization. The political train has gone a 
long way, crushing the old economy. Time will tell whether it 
has gone forward or backward, but the fact that different 
realities have taken shape is indisputable. Just as something 
else is also obvious: A new economy has not so far emerged to 
go with them. At the moment losses are being calculated. 
Moldavia has been left without an industry. Whereas a few 
years ago it accounted for 67 percent of the budget, last year 
the figure was only 9.3 percent. And the slump has not stopped. 
Orientation on the agro-industrial complex alone is depriving 
the republic of any hope of ranking as a developed country. 
Even the CIS itself still looks pretty vague and unsteady. So 
it will hardly prove possible rapidly to restore the severed 
ties. And it is the loss of these ties that Moldavian Premier 
A. Sangheli sees as one of the main reasons for the current 
crisis, added to the vast material losses that the Republic 
sustained owing to its refusal to ratify the treaty in the first 
place. This refusal not only cost Moldavia a large sum of 
money, but also brought about the early resignation of the 
former corps of deputies and the government. The election 
winners have come to power; and rapidly signed the treaty. The 
first step has been taken. It is still hard to say whether they 
have won or had victory thrust upon them, although a policy of 
interest and compromise does seem to be replacing the policy of 
confrontation in Moldavia. However, it is too early to say 
whether this is the end of the story. There is probably more to 
come.

  [Text] Yerevan 18 May 18 -- Armenian Defence Minister Serzh 
Sargsyan has expressed satisfaction with the results of the 
meeting of the heads of the military establishments of Russia, 
Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh, which ended in Moscow 
on Tuesday. Together with other members of the armenian 
delegation, he returned to Yerevan late at night on 17 May. 
  Interviewed by ITAR-TASS at the Yerevan airport, the 
minister 
stressed that the meeting was on the whole normal. "Our desire 
to achieve peace in the region was echoed by the Russian side, 
which did everything it could as mediator to settle the Karabakh 
conflict," Sargsyan stated. "God knows that the Azeri decision 
to sign the offered document or not did not depend on us," he 
added. 
  Touching on the Azeri delegation's stand at the Moscow 
meeting, the Armenian defence minister expressed the view that 
the Azeri side would not be able to refuse for long to sign the 
document and would finally quite soon. "The current refusal is a 
temporary obstacle," Sargsyan believes. "The peace-making 
process in the region will without doubt continue. There is no 
alternative to it," the Armenian defence minister stated.

on the settlement of the Karabakh problem with participation of 
defense ministers of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Commander of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Army mediated by Russian Defense Minister Pavel

Moscow claimed that Armenia insisted on considering the status 
of Nagorno-Karabakh along with the withdrawal of troops from 
seized Azeri territories. 
  Press-secretary of the Armenian president Levon Zurabyan 
declined to comment on the situation around the talks until the 
return of the Armenian delegation from Moscow.

  [Text] Yerevan 17 May TASS -- A statement of the Armenian 
parliament presidium circulated here today expressed concern 
over the terrorist act in the Armenian drama theatre in Tbilisi 
last Sunday [15 May]. 
  The statement says that this encroachment upon ethnic 
Armenian residents of Georgia is not the only one. It provokes 
alarm over the safety of the Armenian population of Georgia. 
  The parliament heads hope the Georgian authorities will do 
their best to find the criminals in the near future and severely 
punish them, as well as work to prevent similar actions in 
future. The Armenian parliament leaders expressed sympathy with 
the explosion victims and their families. 
  Georgian State Head Eduard Shevardnadze telephoned Armenian 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan today in connection with the 
incident. He assured the Armenian leader that the Georgian 
authorities will do their best to reveal the terrorists and 
punish them, sources at the Armenian president's press service 
report. 
  A statement of the Armenian Foreign Ministry has been made 
in 
connection with the terrorist act. The ministry accused of the 
incident "the forces hampering regional stabilization and 
striving to turn the Karabakh confrontation in a regional 
conflict and involve Armenia in the war." In his turn, Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan described the terrorist act as a provocation 
against the traditional Armenian-Georgian friendship.

  [Text] A joint Russian-Armenian commission set up to 
coordinate works on bringing on line the Armenian nuclear power 
station considered financing the project and the progress in the 
station's state analysis in Moscow this week. 
  The Russian Atomic Energy Ministry told INTERFAX that the 
date of the station's new launch was unclear as financing the 
works remained unsettled. 
  However, Yerevan is to entirely finance all works on the 
station carried out jointly with Russia in accordance with the 
17 March treaty. 
  According to the treaty, Russia committed itself to take 
part 
in examining, reactivating and bringing on-line the station's 
main installations as well as additional activities to ensure 
its safety. Moscow also said it would supply the station with 
nuclear fuel. 
  In late April, Armenian Vice Prime Minister Vigen Chitechyan 
said his republic had completed preparatory works on the station 
closed down in March 1989 under heavy public pressure which 
followed the December 1988 earthquake. Yerevan plans to launch 
the station by the end of this year. Taking into account 
Armenia's highly unstable seismic conditions, the station must 
withstand an earthquake of force nine on the Richter scale. To 
reactivate the station, a minimum of $70 million is needed. 
  The republican government decided to bring the station 
on-line again as it used to cover more than 40 percent of the 
republic's energy consumption as far back as a year ago. At 
present, power is mainly produced by hydroelectrical stations 
which are capable of covering only 25-30 percent of the demand.

  [Text] Baku, 16 May (TURAN)--On the evening of May 15, the 
police vacated the building of the AZADLIQ editorial office 
which was controlled for the entire day. 
  The previous day, the police told the employees of the 
newspaper that Baku's mayor, Rafael Alakhverdiyev, issued a 
decree stating that the editorial office had to leave the 
building. 
  On May 15, State Advisor, Gabil Guseinli, told Deputy 
Ibragim 
Ibragimli that "the matter concerning the removal of the 
newspaper was adopted by the government and I have nothing to do 
with it". 
  Meanwhile, on May 15 the authorities revoked their own 
resolution and the police left the building. On the same day an 
employee in of the Presidential staff told TURAN's correspondent 
that "the resolution concerning the removal has been annulled". 
However, Baku's mayor also issued a decree concerning the 
evacuation by the independent TURAN agency, Centre for Strategic 
Researches, Polyglot International Centre, Centre for 
Azerbaijan's Democratic Reforms, AZADLIG editorial office from 
the building. 
  On May 14 the closure of independent television channel, 
BMT, 
was reported which caused severe criticism. 
  On the next day, 16 of Azerbaijan's political parties 
condemned the authorities' activities and demanded an end to 
such illegal activities. 
  It is difficult to say why the authorities changed their 
position. But it is clear that the actions by the current 
leadership are becoming more and more unreasonable and may lead 
to heightened tension.

  [Text] Azerbaijan's military forces fired on the Armenian 
defense positions in Mardakertskiy Rayon on the night of 15 May. 
The incident took place after a two-day lull in the fighting. 
As reported earlier, the Armenian side refrained from returning 
fire. 
  Although an agreement has been reached in Moscow to end the 
fighting, the situation in the confrontation areas between the 
Nagrono-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and Azerbaijan continues to be 
unstable. Azerbaijan National Army subunits have violated the 
cease-fire agreement from time to time. The NKR Defense Army 
Headquarters Press Service has disclosed that Azerbaijan's 
military units fired on the Armenian positions in the northern 
part of Mardakertskiy Rayon and the central areas in Agdamskiy 
Rayon last night and this morning. One NKR military man was 
wounded. However, the defense units continued to heed the NKR 
Defense Army Headquarters' order not to return the enemy fire. 
The same source also disclosed that the situation on the other 
parts of the NKR front line has been relatively peaceful. 
  The situation in the border region between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan was peaceful last night and this morning, that is, as 
of noon today. 
  Peace and security must prevail on the border between the 
two 
republics. Regardless of the tension between the two sides, the 
relations between the two republics must be restored. Our 
people lived as neighbors in the past; they will continue to 
live as neighbors in the future. It is common knowledge that 
close neighbors are [words indistinct] than distant countries. 
Therefore, it is time to end the hostile activities between the 
two sides.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva and </F>
Viktor Shulman] 
  [Text] Baku May 17 TASS -- Azerbaijan denounced Armenian 
statements that Nagorno-Karabakh can be proclaimed a republic 
and join Armenia in future and qualified such plans as a "rude 
distortion of the essence of the negotiating process, an actual 
appeal to the resumption of combat activities." 
  The press service of the president of Azerbaijan said in a 
statement on Tuesday that "the sides directly involved in the 
conflict should by their practical activities and statements 
promote the creation of a political atmosphere for a further 
development of the negotiating process which has just begun." 
  Also on Tuesday Azerbaijan refused to sign a cease-fire 
protocol in Moscow and its defence minister left for Baku for 
additional consultations. 
  But the press service of the leader of Azerbaijan said the 
"republic stands for a just and peaceful settlement of the 
conflict, as well as for constructive Russian proposals." 
  "Azerbaijan proceeds from the fact that the mentioned 
efforts 
and proposals should be implemented in the framework of 
generally-recognised norms and principles of international law, 
first and foremost, in the context of ensuring the sovereignty, 
territorial integrity and inviolability of frontiers of the 
Republic of Azerbaijan," according to the statement.

  [Text] Baku 17 May TASS -- "The position of Azerbaijan 
remains unchanged. It stands for the settlement of the Karabakh 
problem in the CSCE framework", Vafa Gulidze, the republican 
state adviser on foreign policy, told TASS on Tuesday after 
Azerbaijan refused to sign a ceasefire protocol brokered by 
Moscow between the warring sides. 
  He rejected mass media reports that Azerbaijan had accepted 
only the Russian plan according to which Russian peace-keepers 
are to be deployed in the zone of conflict. "These allegations 
are absolutely groundless and can be assesseed as pressure on 
the republic", Gulidze said. 
  "We are not against cooperation with Russia, however the 
Armenian-Azeri conflict has acquired an international character 
and can be resolved only in the framework of the CSCE of which 
Russia is a member", he stressed. 
  According to Gulidze, neither the president, nor the foreign 
minister, nor he himself have seen the document discussed in 
Moscow. 
  At the same time he recalled that Azerbaijan had agreed on 
Monday with the document proposed by the chairman of the CSCE 
Minsk Group for Karabakh which envisages a ceasefire, 
disengagement of troops and a simultaneous withdrawal of 
Armenian forces from occupied Azeri territories. 
  Armenians have in words agreed with the proposal too, but 
did 
not sign it explaining that they are unaware of the results of 
the Moscow meeting of defence ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia, 
and Russia, according to Gulidze.

  [Text] Baku 17 May TASS -- "Having complete authority to 
sign the final protocol offered at negotiations in Moscow, I did 
not do it only because some aspects required additional 
studies," Azeri Defence Minister Mamedrafi Mamedov, who headed 
the Azeri military delegation to Moscow negotiations of 
Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, told AZERTADZH today. 
  In his words, the document can be signed only after the 
Azeri 
specification of some items of the protocol, whose major 
provisions have been basically coordinated. 
  Mamedov said the Azeri troops staying in the Armenian-Azeri 
conflict zone have been ordered to cease fire despite the fact 
Azerbaijan has not signed the final protocol. The cease-fire 
agreement is being observed by both sides, he stressed.

  [Text] Baku (May 16) TURAN: "We are on the threshold of a 
very important stage in the settlement of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict," said President Aliyev during 
yesterday's reception for a delegation from the US Department of 
State headed by the Coordinator for the Newly Independent States 
(NIS), James Collins. 
  President Aliyev mentioned that Azerbaijan stands for a 
settlement of the conflict on the basis of the principles of the 
CSCE. He said that the representative of the CSCE Minsk Group 
must take part in Moscow's meeting of Defense Ministers between 
Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, which is scheduled for 
today. 
  As far as the status of Nagorno-Karabakh is concerned, 
President Aliyev said that this matter must be discussed in the 
context of territorial integrity and inviolability of 
Azerbaijan's state borders. 
  Touching upon the matter of the oil contracts, President 
Aliyev said that "the talks concerning the joint development of 
Azeri oil-fields have entered their final stage." 
  According to several sources, an oil contract with the 
consortium of Western firms will be signed by the end of 
December. According to TURAN, the consortium of western 
companies is not ready for signing the contract in the near 
future.

  [Text] Baku, MAY 17 (TURAN)--Russian Deputy Defense 
Minister, Colonel General, Georgiy Kondratyev, has been 
appointed the Commander of the Russian military contingent in 
the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict zone. 
  Georgiy Kondratyev is one of the Deputy Defense Ministers 
who 
is close to Pavel Grachev and who can be called a player on his 
team. In the Defense Ministry he was called "a hero of the 
October events". According to his colleagues, it was he who 
headed all arrangements concerning the neutralization of the 
Russian Parliament supporters. Earlier Kondratyev was in 
command of the Turkestan Military District and in 1991 he 
created the first CIS military commercial centre which was 
engaged in the sale of military automobiles and tractors. 
Kondratyev is fond of sport, film and military music. He is 
also a specialist in emergency situations. 
  According to military sources, Kondratyev sharply differs 
from Generals Gromov and Mironov who held in high respect among 
the officers and generals of the Russian Army. 
  A year ago, Kondratyev headed the operation concerning the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia. However, this fact 
caused Shevardnadze's dissatisfaction since he was against 
Kondratyev's appointment. Later, the Georgian party said that 
instead of a withdrawal of troops from Abkhazia, Kondratyev 
supplied supporters of Ardzinba with military hardware and 
ammunitions. At the same time, Kondratyev acted as coordinator 
between the Russian Defense Ministry and Abkhazia's military 
commandant.

  [Text] Baku, May 17 (TURAN) -- "The agreement which was 
signed yesterday by the Defense Ministers of Azerbaijan and 
Armenia as well as the Commandant of Nagorno-Karabakh in Moscow 
threatens Azerbaijan's independence", the Deputy Chairman of the 
Popular Front, Asim Mollazadeh, told TURAN's correspondent. 
Mollazade said that the stationing of Russian troops will mean 
the restoration of Moscow's military control over Azerbaijan. 
The second danger is that the United Nations and the CSCE will 
be out of the game concerning the settlement of the conflict. 
  The leader of National Independence Party, Etibar Mamedov, 
said that "it is impossible to call troops of another state to 
Azerbaijan without permission from the Parliament. We will 
oppose the return of the Russian empire to Azerbaijan". 
  "The Defense Minister has no right to sign a document 
concerning the deployment of troops of another state in the 
country since it is among his duties. That is why I think that 
this agreement has no legal force", the leader of Musavat Party, 
Isa Gambar, told TURAN. State Advisor, Gabil Guseinli, speaking 
with a correspondent from AZADLIG said that "we are speaking 
about CSCE observers with an additional military contingent and 
not about Russian troops. Moreover, that extra contingent will 
submit itself to the CSCE observers".

  [Text] Head of the Georgian delegation at talks on a 
settlement in Abkhazia, Dzhaba Ioseliani, told INTERFAX that the 
main aim of the agreement on a cease-fire and troop separation 
signed in Moscow on 14 May was "setting up a security zone for 
the return of refugees with the help of peace keeping forces." 
  He said that this zone would include territory from the 
Western Georgian city of Zugdidi to Gali -- a regional center in 
Southern Abkhazia. 
  He said that the peace keeping forces (2,500 to 3,000 men -- 
INTERFAX) will enter the "security zone,", which will be set up 
after the withdrawal of Georgian and Abkhaz formations from the 
Inguri river, by the end of May. At the beginning of June 
refugees will start to return to the Gali region. He said that 
88 UN observers based in Abkhazia would also control the 
situation in the security zone and that an increase in their 
numbers was currently being discussed. "No Georgian or Abkhaz 
troops will be in the security zone," he emphasized. 
  Ioseliani also reported that mobile patrol groups made up of 
up to 400 peace keeping soldiers would be formed in the Kodor 
canyon, from which Georgian and Abkhaz troops must withdraw. 
  He stressed that all these are initial moves and that talks 
would continue and a plan worked out for returning all the 
refugees to Abkhazia. 
  He said that at the end of this week military 
representatives 
of Georgia, Abkhazia and the CIS would meet. The meeting will 
establish the exact position of the peace-keeping forces.

<F P=106> ["Edict of the Georgian Head of State on Urgent Measures To </F>
Strengthen the Struggle Against Drug Addiction and the Drugs 
Business"] 
  [Text] The difficult socioeconomic situation that exists 
in the Republic of Georgia, the deterioration of the crime 
situation, and the weakening of border controls have contributed 
to the spread of drug addiction in the country. It is also 
significant that the drugs mafia in different countries is 
showing a particular interest in Georgia as a country that is 
convenient for the transit of drugs. An internal market is 
arising in Georgia for the production and sale of drugs derived 
from plants. The spread of drug addiction among minors and 
adolescents is arousing particular concern and drug addiction 
among women is also a serious problem. 
  In order to plan, coordinate, and control measures aimed at 
the comprehensive prevention of drug addiction in the Republic 
of Georgia, the implementation of a single state policy in this 
sphere, and to combat drug addiction and the illegal circulation 
of narcotic substances, a government commission has been formed 
under the chairmanship of Georgian Deputy Prime Minister I. 
Menagharishvili. The commission is made up of representatives of 
the Republic of Georgia Cabinet of Ministers and scientific, 
health, and youth organizations. 
  In order to strengthen further the struggle against drug 
addiction and the drugs business, it is decreed: 
  1. To accept the proposal of the government commission and 
to create a national bureau for combating drug addiction and the 
drugs business on the basis of the Republic of Georgia Ministry 
of Internal Affairs Department for Combating Drug Addiction and 
the Drugs Business. 
  2. The Republic of Georgia Ministry of Internal Affairs is 
to ratify the rules and structure of the National Bureau for 
Combating Drug Addiction and the Drugs Business within a period 
of 10 days. 
  3. The Republic of Georgia Ministry of Justice, along with 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs, is to prepare within one month 
draft legislative acts on controlling the legal circulation of 
narcotic and psychotropic substances, on combating their illegal 
circulation, and on conferring the right to the Republic of 
Georgia Ministry of Internal Affairs National Bureau for 
Combating Drug Addiction and the Drugs Business to sell 
valuables confiscated by a decision of the court in this 
category of cases. 
  4. The Republic of Georgia Ministry of Communications is to 
provide the service with modern means of communication by 1 May 
of this year. 
  5. The Republic of Georgia Cabinet of Ministers and the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs are to provide the National Bureau 
for Combating Drug Addiction and the Drugs Business with a 
material and technical base within a period of one month. 
  6. In order to protect the rule of law in matters concerning 
the struggle against drug addiction and the drugs business and 
exercise supervision, a department is to be created within the 
Republic of Georgia Procurator's Office to supervise cases 
concerning the illegal circulation of narcotic and psychotropic 
substances. 
  7. The Republic of Georgia Customs Department is to create a 
corresponding service in order to strengthen organized control 
over the transfer of narcotic and psychotropic substances at 
customs checkpoints. To report the results to the Government 
Commission for Combating Drug Addiction and the Illegal 
Circulation of Drugs. 
  8. The Republic of Georgia Ministry for Health Protection is 
immediately to create a republican inspectorate to control the 
legal circulation of narcotic and psychotropic substances. 
  9. The Republic of Georgia Ministries of Internal Affairs 
and Health Protection are to provide a register of [those 
involved in] the drugs business and users of drugs for 
nonmedical purposes and ensure the effective implementation of 
Georgian Head of State Decree 32 of 5 February 1994. 
  10. The Republic of Georgia Television and Radio 
Broadcasting Corporation and the Republic of Georgia Information 
and Publishing Corporation are to cooperate closely with the 
Republic of Georgia Ministry of Internal Affairs National Bureau 
for Combating Drug Addiction and the Drugs Business and the 
Republic of Georgia Ministry of Health Protection Drug Research 
Institute in order to disseminate efficiently the appropriate 
information on television and in the press.

  [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Members of 
Ukraine's working delegation to Washington attended a briefing 
at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry on 17 May. Ukraine's Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov, who led the delegation, believes the 
signing of the memorandum on mutual understanding between the 
governments of Ukraine and the United States on the transfer of 
missile equipment and technology has become an important step in 
Ukraine's accession to the world distribution of labor in the 
implementation of space programs, since no country owns a 
complete production cycle in this area. The document also 
illustrates the fact that "Ukraine has joined the group of 
civilized countries, instead of falling to the level of Iraq or 
North Korea." 
  In the course of negotiations, the Ukrainian side managed to 
persuade the United States to lift the clause in the agreement 
on space cooperation between the United States and Russia that 
concerns the countries of the former Soviet Union as one which 
infringes upon the rights of the third party. 
  Giving a generally favorable assessment of the trip's 
results, Valeriy Kazakov, deputy minister of machine-building, 
military-industrial complex, and conversion, said that despite 
U.S. assurances of a fine state of relations between the United 
States and Ukraine, economic cooperation and work in the sphere 
of conversion is proceeding slowly. A great deal of attention 
during the visit was paid to the intensification of conversion 
programs. For example, it was possible to agree to a list of 35 
enterprises subject to immediate restructuring. The U.S. side 
has allocated $20 million to this end. 
  Asked by UNIAN to comment on the breakthrough in the U.S. 
attitude to Ukraine, Deputy Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk said 
it reflected international reality and our country's consistent 
policy stance. Tarasyuk emphasized that this change began after 
the signing of the trilateral statement by Ukraine, Russia, and 
the United States.

Foreign Affairs point out, however, that the agreement cannot be 
regarded as an international treaty, since one of the sides (the 
Republic of Crimea) has no international legal status, being an 
autonomous constituent part of Ukraine. 
  The agreement that was signed stipulates its aim as that of 
promoting further development of ties between the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Crimea as a part of Ukraine on 
the basis of the Russo-Ukrainian intergovernmental agreement on 
trade and economic cooperation in 1994. What the Ukrainian side 
is concerned about is the very procedure of signing this 
agreement, since Russia had previously stated to all countries 
and international organizations that entities within the Russian 
Federation signing foreign trade agreements must coordinate 
their actions with the federal authorities. 
  In its relations with the Russian Federation, Ukraine 
strictly adheres to the proposed procedure. Thus, direct trade 
agreements between Ukraine and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) 
and the Republic of Tatarstan were signed only after necessary 
consent was obtained from the Russian federal authorities. 
Ukraine informed the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a 
respective note dated 29 March that the Republic of Crimea is 
required to coordinate its actions with Ukraine's central 
authorities in setting up international and foreign trade links. 
But this was not done and Russia has once again violated the 
principle of reciprocity in international relations.

<F P=106> [Report by Konstantin Parishkura under the "Neighbors" </F>
rubric: "Crimea Wants Out of Ukraine"] 
  [Text] A session of Crimea's parliament will reinstate in 
the next few days the 6 May 1992 Constitution of the Republic of 
Crimea under which Crimea is not part of Ukraine. This was 
announced to journalists by Sergey Tsekov, speaker of the 
Crimean Supreme Council, in his first news conference on 15 May. 
The Crimean Supreme Council's final objective is to restore 
unity with Russia, he said. This is recorded in the programs of 
the Republican Party and the "Russia" election bloc from which 
the majority of the deputies and President Yuriy Meshkov were 
elected. The speaker also intimated that a Crimean national 
guard will soon be set up. 
  Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the People's Rukh of 
Ukraine, 
has stated in this connection to the "INTERFAX-UKRAINE" news 
agency: "A coup is under way in Crimea with all-round support 
from the Russian Federation." In his view, the fact that 
"ranking officials from Russia are taking part" in the work of 
the Crimean parliament is also a matter for concern. They "are 
suggesting to Crimean leaders the idea that Crimea join the CIS, 
and that Crimea should raise the question of the withdrawal of 
Ukraine's armed forces from its territory."

<F P=106> [Article by MOLOD UKRAYINY special correspondent Vitaliy </F>
Portnykov: "Meshkov Holds Negotiations With Luzhkov"] 
  [Text] During his recent visit to the Russian capital, 
Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov signed an agreement on economic 
cooperation with Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov. Of course, the 
press was not so much interested in the list of goods that the 
Crimea is going to trade with Moscow, as in the very fact of 
Meshkov's meeting with one of the most prominent Russian 
politicians who was recently named among plausible successors to 
either Boris Yeltsin or Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  The content of the negotiations between Meshkov and Luzhkov 
has remained a secret for journalists as also the content of the 
huge bag that Meshkov presented to the Moscow mayor (Luzhkov 
presented the Crimean president with a vase decorated with the 
Russian coat of arms). At the news conference given after the 
signing of the agreement on economic cooperation, the Moscow 
mayor recalled that Moscow already has similar agreements with 
both former Soviet republics and subjects of the Russian state. 
However, the agreement with the Crimea is, after all, special: 
The mayor considers the political processes on the peninsula to 
be incomplete and calls upon Russians to assist the Crimea. 
Luzhkov characterized going to the Crimea on vacations as a 
patriotic duty of every Russian citizen. 
  The head of the autonomy was less fastidious in his 
statements. He expressed confidence that the fact of both sides' 
being apart was temporary, as "the economy will unite all of 
us," proposed that the problem of the Black Sea Fleet be 
resolved in the course of bilateral negotiations between 
Russia... and the Crimea (!), and bitterly complained at the 
conduct of [Ukraine's defense minister] General Radetskyy, who 
had imprudently reminded Meshkov of the actual meaning of his 
"autonomous post." While characterizing "Ukraine's economic 
collapse," Meshkov reminded the audience that every nationalism 
has two paths: One toward economic dislocation and the second 
-- toward a civil war. "For the time being, Ukraine has opted 
for the former, but it is at a dangerous brink," stressed 
Meshkov, who tried, in all of his other statements, to adhere to 
the role of a well-wishing director of a holiday home and 
guaranteed the Russians every security, if they finally 
succumbed to the joint persuasions by the mayor and president 
and go to the Crimea. In Yuriy Meshkov's opinion, it is only 
now that the holiday-making in the Crimea is so cheap, since the 
Crimean leader sees his peninsula precisely in the ruble zone, 
perhaps, next to Tajikistan involved in conflicts.... 
  Therefore, everybody must be in a hurry.

  [Text] Ukraine and Austria, which are separated by only a 
few hundred kilometers, should influence one another, and my 
meetings with Ukrainian officials are yet another step toward 
preserving peace in Europe. This was said at a news conference 
by Austrian Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend, who is currently 
on an official visit to Ukraine. As Ukrainian Defense Minister 
Vitaliy Radetskyy noted, both countries advocate the development 
of mobile and effective armed forces. The exchange of 
experience at all military levels between Ukraine and Austria 
will play an important role in ensuring European stability. The 
defense ministers spoke in positive terms about NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program, which envisions equal conditions 
for all countries. They also announced the signing a joint 
statement on cooperation between the Ukrainian and Austrian 
Defense Ministries. Dr. Werner Fasslabend also met with Dmytro 
Chernenko, Ukraine's minister of machine-building, defense 
industries, and conversion.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Mokrishchev: "Thefts at the Level of </F>
`Accidents'"] 
  [Text] Donetsk Oblast -- ...The night shift at the 
"Shakhterskaya-Glybokaya" pit was in full swing. The shipment 
of coal was preceding normally. When suddenly the alarm on the 
control panel went off -- one of the skip elevators had broken 
down. They replaced the electronic part of the instrument, but 
there was no change.... The duty engineer discovered the cause 
and reported that a sensor containing a radioactive source of 
cesium 137 had been stolen. Only with the help of this device 
is it possible to spot in the shroud of coal dust the critical 
moment which is followed by an inevitable accident. 
  Several hours had passed after the emergency situation near 
Shakterskiy, when a still more alarming signal came from the 
city of Dzerzhinsk. Here three vials disappeared at once during 
the work shift. The robbers did not stand on ceremony, and 
carried them off together with their lead containers, which 
weigh 100 kg each. 
  The disappearance from industrial enterprises of radioactive 
isotopes with an activity of three curie is no laughing matter. 
Hence, the events were immediately reported to officials of the 
Donetsk Oblast Association for the Protection of Public Health. 
The official investigation uncovered many circumstances of the 
theft of the lethal vials -- customers have been found abroad 
and, for the sake of relatively paltry sums of hard currency, 
people are exposing themselves to the risk of a slow death. 
  These thefts, which are taking on the character of a real 
disaster for Donbass enterprises, are already becoming 
customary. Twenty-one such "accidents" -- this is how the 
emergency situations involving radioactive isotopes are 
described in official documents -- have been recorded in the 
oblast. But whereas until recent times 14 cases were caused by 
unpremeditated actions and circumstances, seven in the last few 
months have been the result of thefts.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev 17 May TASS -- A statement of the press service 
of the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of Ministers on the 
Crimean situation has been circulated by mass media today. 
  The statement runs as follows: 
  "The recent developments in the Crimea, statements and acts 
of the Crimean officials provoke Ukrainian and international 
concern over a possibility of sharp deterioration of the Crimean 
social and economic situation and formation of a danger and 
instability spot in Central Europe. 
  ``The new leadership of the autonomy has passed over from 
declaration of its intentions to actions aiming to change the 
legal status of the Autonomous Republic of the Crimea as an 
integral party of Ukraine. 
  ``For instance, a regular meeting of the Crimean Supreme 
Soviet plans to discuss the return to specific provisions of the 
Crimean Constitution in the edition of 6 May 1992, which ran 
counter to the Ukrainian Constitution and were changed by the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet itself in September 1992. Thus, an 
attempt is being made to revise the current Crimean constitution 
and create grounds for the Crimean separation from Ukraine which 
would be a gross violation of the Ukrainian territorial 
integrity. 
  ``Attempts of the Crimean leadership to legalize Crimean 
citizenship, create the Crimean Armed Forces and change the 
status of the city of Sevastopol provoke alarm. 
  ``All this runs counter to the Ukrainian Constitution and 
laws, as well as universally-recognized principles of the 
international law. 
  ``Ambitious strivings of some Crimean politicians run 
counter 
to the Ukrainian goodwill to contribute to the comprehensive 
social, economic and cultural development of the Crimea. It was 
the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet that gave the Crimean region a 
status of the autonomous republic within Ukraine, adopted a law 
`on division of powers between the Ukrainian and Crimean state 
power bodies.' The Ukrainian president issued a decree `on 
regime of open economy on territory of the Crimean Republic.' 
The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers has regulated with the 
Crimean Government the property issues, the formation of the 
budget and implemented a number of measures to stabilize the 
Crimean economy. 
  ``Ukraine is holding a policy to restore historical justice 
as regards the deported peoples, and helps the return of Crimean 
Tatars to their historical motherland. 
  ``Instead of fully using the possibilities to overcome the 
economic crisis, certain political forces of the Crimean 
Autonomous Republic have adopted a different course. They are 
clearly speculating on economic difficulties in Ukraine and 
other Commonwealth states. Even under these complicated 
conditions Ukraine finds it possible to cover the deficit of 
Crimean financial and material resources. Despite the objective 
realities, anti-Ukrainian and anti-state feelings are being 
stirred up among the Crimean population. 
  ``The facts show that dangerous processes in the Crimean 
Republic not only have purely Crimean nature but also, to a 
considerable extent, encouraged by certain Russian political 
forces, whose actions are growing into clear interference in the 
Ukrainian internal affairs. 
  ``In accordance with the Ukrainian Constitution and the 
current legislation, the Republic of Crimea is an integral 
autonomous part of Ukraine, which has broad rights in the sphere 
of the economy, the use of natural resources, ecology, culture 
and public life. Being an integral autonomous part of Ukraine, 
the Republic of Crimea is not a carrier of state sovereignty and 
cannot have political relations with foreign states. 
  ``The Ukrainian Constitution is valid throughout Ukraine, 
including the Crimea. The Ukrainian territory is single, 
indivisible, inviolable and integral. The Republic of Crimea 
cannot have its own, separated from Ukraine, citizenship. 
Citizens of the Crimean Republic are also citizens of Ukraine. 
The autonomy cannot have its own armed forces. 
  ``The press service of the Ukrainian president and the 
Cabinet of Ministers is authorized to state that the Ukrainian 
president and the Supreme Soviet will take all measures 
necessary to stabilize the Crimean political situation and 
ensure territorial integrity of Ukraine. The Ukrainian 
president will provide for unconditional observation of the 
Ukrainian Constitution and laws throughout territory of the 
state, including the Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine. 
  ``The press service of the Ukrainian president and the 
Cabinet of Ministers calls attention to the fact that some 
Russian politicians and public figures are breaking the rules 
and norms of behavior on territory of a foreign state. In this 
connection any further attempts to interfere in the Ukrainian 
internal affairs will be resolutely stopped in accordance with 
the current Ukrainian legislation.''

  [Text] At the first session of the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council, many deputies pointed to certain incongruities between 
the legislation on people's deputies elections and the current 
Ukrainian Constitution. In this regard, Central Electoral 
Commission Chairman Ivan Yemets yesterday provided his 
explanations to the Ukrainian Radio and Television Company. 
  [Begin Yemets recording] Actually, there are many such 
incongruities between the Constitution and Electoral Law. 
First, in four constituencies, the elections were held with the 
participation of one candidate, since others had withdrawn their 
candidacies. Article 89 of the Constitution says that any number 
of candidates can be included in a ballot. Following is a 
characteristic example. In the 147th constituency of Donetsk's 
Artemivskyy rayon, two candidates -- Chuprun and Panasovskyy -- 
were running in the elections. Panasovskyy won 49.3 percent of 
the votes, and all other candidates won less votes. Chuprun 
withdrew his candidacy, and the remaining five people refused to 
run, realizing that they had no chance. What should be done in 
such a case? Where to find one more candidate, if there are 
none in sight? Another question is the implementation of 
Article 48 of the Electoral Law. Who runs in run-off elections? 
As you know, run-off elections have been scheduled in 112 
constituencies in Ukraine. In 92 constituencies where the 
elections were held but none of candidates won the required 
number of votes -- 50 percent -- those people cannot run again 
in the run-off elections. However, there are 20 constituencies 
in which the voters did not participate in the elections for 
some reason. The question arises as to whether those people who 
won in these constituencies can also participate in the run-off 
elections or not. The Central Electoral Commission has 
therefore asked the Supreme Council to provide its 
interpretation of these articles of the Electoral Law, and 
certain other articles, since there are many contradictions with 
the Constitution and other laws. This is why we have asked the 
Supreme Council to provide an interpretation of this law. [end

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 20, 9-15 May 94] </F>
  [Text] The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, proceeding from 
the President's Decree "On measures to liberalize Ukraine's 
export policies" (see UBN no. 19), adopted a resolution on 6 May 
to set up the Ukrvneshtorg (Ukraine's Foreign Trade) Concern to 
be composed of the state-owned Ukrvneshprom (Ukrainian Foreign 
Industry), Slavutych-Ruda (Dnieper Ore), Slavutych-Stal (Steel), 
Ukrtsvetprom (Ukraine's Nonferrous Metallurgy), and 
Ukrvneshkhimprom (Ukraine's Foreign Chemical Industry) foreign 
economic associations. 
  Ukrvneshtorg is designed to export produce (commodities and 
services) within the framework of the State Order and State 
Contract involving nomenclatures to be determined by the Cabinet 
of Ministers. 
  The State Contract's amounts were specified by the Cabinet's 
resolution, which was adopted in mid-March 1994.

  The Ukrvneshtorg Concern's president is appointed by the 
Cabinet on the former's submission. Presently, Vadim Plotkin is 
its acting president. He is to register the Concern within a 
10-day period. 
  Commenting on the resolution at UKRINFORM's request, 
Alexander Nasekan, the Industry Ministry's foreign economic 
relations agency superintendent, said the Ministry would, to a 
certain extent, take part in Ukrvneshtorg's activities. However, 
specific forms will be clear only after its statute has been 
drafted and approved. 
  The role to be played by the former so-called "special 
exporters" remains unclear. One is left to wonder, if the move 
was purposefully prompted by the director corps to make a show 
of supposedly rigid control under the Cabinet's pressure, or 
whether it should be interpreted as the government's step toward 
a more centralized system of effort distribution and sharing 
export incomes. 
  However, the details and underlying goals of the changes 
underway are likely to surface in a matter of days.
