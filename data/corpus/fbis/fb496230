<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 20, 9-15 May 94] </F>
  [Text] A February resolution by the Ukrainian Cabinet of 
Ministers provides for serial production by the Kiev Aircraft 
Production Association, KAPA, of AN-70 military transport 
aircraft and AN-70T transport planes equipped with D-27 engines. 
  The aircraft order's break-down is 400 planes for Russia and 
100 for Ukraine. 
  The Antonov research-and-development and production complex 
is supposed to start the AN-70 prototype's flight trials in the 
second quarter of 1994. The plane's stand trials were in January. 
  Negotiations are reported underway with France, Britain, and 
Pacific Rim nations to sell the advanced plane to them. 
  The AN-70 project is the collective brainchild of over 100 
enterprises in Ukraine, Russia and Uzbekistan. 
  The Ukrainian and Russian governments signed an agreement on 
AN-70 serial production by the Dnepropetrovsk Yuzhny Engineering 
Plant (it used to manufacture space rocketry), and Russia's 
aircraft factory in Samara. 
  The D-27 engines, which were designed by the Progress bureau 
in Zaporozhye, are to be manufactured by Zaporozhye's Motor-Sich 
and Ufa's (Russia) engine manufacturers. 
  After a cost analysis, however, the Ukrainian Government 
decided to abandon the idea of placing the order for AN-70's 
with the Yuzhny manufacturers and put its stake on KAPA instead, 
which started preparations for AN-70 serial production together 
with the Antonov complex as early as 1997. 
  Concurrently, the government decided to relieve KAPA of its 
previous assignment, which involved manufacture of the AN-218 
aircraft. The latter aircraft will be manufactured by the 
Aviastar production association in Ulyanovsk (Russia).

<F P=106> [Interview with Vice Admiral Aleksandr Ivanovich Frolov, </F>
people's deputy of the Crimean Supreme Soviet, by B. Glinskiy; 
place and date not given: "The Black Sea Fleet Is Holding Out 
Thanks to Russia"] 
  [Excerpt] [Glinskiy] Aleksandr Ivanovich, over the past two 
years, the destiny of the Black Sea Fleet has been sorted out. 
The Russian and Ukrainian presidents signed protocols in Yalta, 
Zavidovo, Moscow, and Massandra; they agreed on an urgent and 
honest resolution to the problem that worries our people. 
Impressive statements in the press and television followed 
these meetings. However, when the presidents returned home, 
their statements acquired another meaning and the protocols' 
clauses remained unfulfilled. What, do you think, is the reason 
for this? 
  [Frolov] We will soon celebrate the 10th anniversary of 
perestroyka, but the old guard still holds the power. 
  People cannot keep the administration in check. To prolong 
its existence, the powers-that-be exercise the meanest methods: 
They set the Ukrainian and Russian peoples against each other. 
These people have been living in peace for over 300 years. 
What is terrible is that the army is involved in political 
battles. Over 50,000 servicemen of the Ukrainian Armed Forces 
are stationed in the Crimea. The Crimean president's decisions 
are adamantly opposed. The young democracy is under the heel of 
bureaucracy. 
  [Glinskiy] Aleksandr Ivanovich, our editorial office 
receives 
many letters and phone calls. Crimean residents ask: What 
should we do? They voice concern over the situation around the 
Black Sea Fleet. You participated in the recent negotiations 
and I would like to know your opinion: Who is to blame for 
their failure? 
  [Frolov] I would not draw your attention to the details of 
the work, which was conducted by the delegations and groups of 
experts at the Black Sea Fleet headquarters. Mass media 
published a detailed report on this event. The participants in 
the negotiations adopted a resolution to divide the fleet. The 
agreements on the separate location and division of its 
infrastructure were not implemented. Instead, old bureaucratic 
tricks were used. The Ukrainian side used dual interpretation 
of the clauses of the Moscow agreement: The breakdown of the 
Russian-Ukrainian negotiations was prompted by nothing else but 
a regular political order from the bureaucracy during the 
campaign for electing Ukrainian president, setting up a new 
legislature, and, hence, a new government. Young generals use 
this high political wave for career purposes. 
  [Glinskiy] Was public opinion or the wishes of the local 
authorities considered at the negotiations? 
  [Frolov] By the time the Russian and Ukrainian delegations 
began working, Crimean President Yu. Meshkov and V. Semenov, 
chairman of the Sevastopol City Executive Council -- who had 
their own opinion and stance on the issue -- arrived at the 
Black Sea Fleet headquarters. For example, one in every four 
Sevastopol residents is directly or indirectly connected with 
the Black Sea Fleet. 
  Ukrainian Defense Minister V. Radetskyy, head of the 
Ukrainian delegation, categorically opposed the participation of 
the representatives of the Crimean and Sevastopol executive 
branches, even as observers. This is how military bureaucracy 
views the local authorities. 
  Public opinion is taken into account in civilized states. 
However, we have another approach. Bureaucrats, who never loved 
the people and only gave orders, currently do not want to take 
public opinion into consideration. 
  [Glinskiy] You know that the Army is maintained at 
taxpayers' 
expense. But our bureaucrats forget about this. Let us, for 
example, take the Ukrainian Navy with only three ships that are 
moored and do not go out to sea due to lack of fuel, ammunition, 
etc. At the same time, the Ukrainian Navy headquarters has 
eight admirals, over 500 officers and warrant officers! They 
have official cars, high expenses, and apartments. They are 
satisfied with their "duties." Billions of karbovanetses of 
people's money are spent. 
  [Frolov] It would have been incorrect on my side to speak 
about the military readiness of the Ukrainian Navy. However, 
there is no smoke without fire. The [Ukrainian] Defense 
Ministry has a voracious appetite, however, if wishes were 
horses, beggars might ride. Having, for example, taken control 
over two first-class military colleges in Sevastopol, the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry simply cannot maintain them. Unique 
equipment is dismantled and buildings fall into disrepair. 
Cadets and teaching staff live in poverty. On the basis of 
these two colleges, a military-naval institute was established. 
Nothing came of this. Currently, they are speaking about 
setting up a military academy. 
  Ukraine has not been financing the Black Sea Fleet since 
last 
October. Not because it does not want to, but because the 
coffers are empty. I do not pin hopes on any replenishment in 
the near future. 
  The Black Sea Fleet is holding out thanks to Russia. It does 
not simply hold out on its own. I am a deputy fleet commander 
for combat training. Last year, the Black Sea Fleet ranked 
second in combat training in comparison to the Northern one.

  [Text] In order to attract foreign investments for the 
development of Ukraine's merchant fleet and in conformity with

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukraine's minister of finance Hryhoriy </F>
Oleksandrovych Pyatachenko by Serhiy Vlad; place and date not 
given: "Does The Payments Crisis Have Only Drawbacks?"] 
  [Text] When finance minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko 
maintains that budget policy has had a considerable effect on 
the improvement of the inflation climate in Ukraine, it is 
difficult to disagree with his statement. Because the payments 
crisis has not only drawbacks, but, however paradoxical it may 
sound, it also has its pluses. It forces one to reduce budget 
expenditure as much as possible, which stabilizes the state's 
monetary circulation. Minister of Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko 
tells what came of this policy in the first quarter. 
  [Pyatachenko] As is known, budgetary receipts were in line 
with the structure of the plan for socioeconomic development in 
1994 and had to account for about 40 percent of the total annual 
revenue. It was, therefore, necessary to take advantage of the 
Supreme Council's permission to grant credits amounting to 10 
percent of quarterly expenditure. 
  During the first quarter, the budget received 67.5 trillion 
karbovantsi [K], including K8 trillion from the National Bank in 
the form of credits to cover the intra-annual gap between the 
receipts of revenues and the need to carry out expenditure. In 
the first quarter, the expenditure constituted K64.1 trillion. 
Thus, you can see that the revenue was K3 trillion 400 billion 
greater than the expenditure. 
  [Vlad] Hryhoriy Oleksandrovych, the budget did not receive 
all those revenues, which had been expected.... 
  [Pyatachenko] The value-added tax came to K12 trillion 96 
billion, or, to put it differently, to 110.6 percent of what had 
been planned. Taxes on the profits of enterprises contributed 
K13.5 trillion or 121.6 percent of what had been expected. 
  The situation is much worse with regard to the receipts of 
excise duty. It was expected that K4.3 trillion would be 
contributed, but only 1.6 trillion (36.5 percent of plan) was 
recorded. This is due to the fact that we established 
exceedingly high rates of excise duty on alcoholic beverages, 
television sets, and a number of other goods. This situation 
will change in the second quarter, because the rates have been 
lowered. The state must regain its lost ranking in product 
sales. Besides, we received more taxes on citizens' profits 
than had been planned, despite the considerable decline in 
production. 
  [Vlad] Not only in terms of prices, but also in terms of 
commodities.... 
  [Pyatachenko] In terms of prices, everything is fine because 
the price factor has played its role, as well as the payment of 
much higher wages than planned, but you are, indeed, right about 
the commodities. 
  [Vlad] In the first quarter, the profit from the external 
economic activity was to amount K6 trillion, but in fact.... 
  [Pyatachenko] K2.4 trillion, or 40 percent. Besides, the 
budget only received 10 percent of the capital earned through 
implementing the privatization program. 
  [Vlad] Despite the more or less satisfactory statistics you 
are quoting, the financing, on the part of the state, of the 
social sphere in the first quarter seems not to have stood up to 
criticism.... 
  [Pyatachenko] We planned to allocate K13.3 trillion for the 
social protection of the population, but only allocated K7.9 
trillion. Support for the state's sociocultural institutions 
was somewhat better.... 
  [Vlad] What did defense industry expenditures amount to in 
the first quarter? 
  [Pyatachenko] It was expected that we would remit K4.7 
trillion, but, in fact, it received only K2.4 trillion. 
  [Vlad] What can you say about crediting industrial 
enterprises from the budget? 
  [Pyatachenko] In order to give support to those enterprises 
that underwent a profound payments crisis, the National Bank 
issued a credit of K11 trillion for three months at an interest 
rate of 120 percent. However, this is outside the budget. 
  [Vlad] Everything that the budget failed to finance in the 
first quarter has already gone down the drain? Well, 
inflation.... 
  [Pyatachenko] What we could not do for lack of time, we will 
catch up with in the second and third quarters. 
  [Vlad] Hryhoriy Oleksandrovych, in the past, budget 
expenditure was covered at the expense of credits and the 
credits -- at the expense of budget receipts. Is this tactic 
undergoing a change? 
  [Pyatachenko] A radical change. This is already a strategy, 
rather than a tactic. We no longer grant credits. Financing 
from the budget is done exclusively within the limits of 
receipts. The National Bank's emission is in conformity with 
the "ceiling" of the increase in the gross domestic product.

  [Text] On 30 April 1994, the Ukrainian president signed 
the edict "On Trade and Economic Missions Within Ukraine's 
Diplomatic Delegations Abroad." In accordance with the edict, 
trade and economic missions will be created within Ukraine's 
diplomatic delegations abroad. They will represent and protect 
Ukraine's interests in the sphere of external economic activity 
in the relevant countries. Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers has 
been authorized to ensure the implementation of measures for 
organizing the work of the trade and economic missions. 
  The edict approves the Regulations on the Trade and Economic 
Missions Within Ukraine's Diplomatic Delegations Abroad. These 
Regulations specify the main work and functions of the trade and 
economic missions, their structure, and procedures for financing 
and resolve the question of interrelations between the missions 
and ministries and other central organizations of Ukraine's 
state executive authority, and so on. 
  In view of the creation of trade and economic missions 
within 
Ukraine's diplomatic delegations abroad, Ukrainian Presidential 
Edict 313 of 17 August 1993 "On the Regulations on Ukraine's 
Trade Missions Abroad" has been invalidated.

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 20, 9-15 May 94] </F>
  [Text] The Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine published on 
6 May 1994 its first-ever data about foreign capital investment 
increments over the first quarter of 1994. According to the 
Ministry's press release, as of 1 April 1994, foreign capital 
investments in Ukraine totalled $180.5 million having increased 
by $66.7 million over the January-March 1994 period. 
  Canada topped the list of major investors (32.7 per cent of 
the aggregate amount), followed by Germany (11.6 per cent), the 
United States (11.1 per cent), Cyprus and Switzerland (4.2 per 
cent each nation), the United Kingdom and Poland (2.9 per cent 
each nation). 
  Russia topped the list of former Union nations, which 
invested in Ukraine (1.7 million US dollars, or 73.7 per cent of 
the former Union nations' total investments). 
  Other nations' investments in Ukraine's economy were much 
more sluggish and totalled $3.9 million by the first quarter's 
close, or just one-forty-fifth of the total investment amount. 
However, their first quarter increment amounted to 2.9 million 
dollars in the first quarter of 1994. 
  Ukraine's capital investments in the January-March 1994 
period were channeled predominantly into economies of European 
nations (99 per cent of the total) with Austria having topped 
the list of recipient nations ($2.9 million). 
  The table below presents the first quarter's foreign capital 
investment break-down.

  Foreign capital investments' aggregate total is estimated by 
Ukrainian experts at between $1.2 and $1.5 billion. 
  Ukrainian enterprises with foreign investments, in 
particular, those located in Kiev, are basically engaged in 
trading and go-between activities (80 per cent of the total 
amount of enterprises). Product manufacture and rendering 
services are basic types of activities for respectively 15 and 5 
per cent of the enterprises. 
  The Cabinet's Decree of 20 May 1993, "On the State Program 
for foreign investment attraction", provides the legal 
foundation for effecting foreign capital investments in Ukraine. 
Following the Decree's provisions, the Law on the State Program 
for foreign investment attraction was passed in December 1993 
(see UBN no. 7/1994). 
  The State Program is designed to stimulate investments in 
large state-owned enterprises with preference given to 11 key 
branches of the national economy. 
  Ukraine's very immediate foreign capital investment 
requirements to cover just a few years to come are estimated at 
$5 billion. 
  The Ukrainian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations is 
currently drafting a list of Ukrainian enterprises, which need 
foreign capital perfusions with specified amounts of 
investments, forms of cooperation and areas of activities. The 
list is supposed to be annually revised and complemented.

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 20, 9-15 May 94] </F>
  [Text] On 13 May 1994 President Leonid Kravchuk signed a 
decree on establishment of the Ukrneftegaz (Ukraine's Oil and 
Gas) National Joint-Stock Company (NJSC) of a holding type. 
  On 14 May, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers discussed a 
draft plan for NJSC stock placing. 
  Enterprises, which belong to the Ukrainian oil and gas 
industry, are supposed to be amalgamated in NJSC as the latter's 
affiliates through contributing their stocks to its authorized 
fund. These enterprises constitute a special group, for which 
the President's decree specified certain conditions involving 
their transformation into joint-stock societies ("On holding 
companies, which are set up in the process of corporatization 
and privatization", of 11 May 1994). 
  The Cabinet approved a decision to set up NJSC as early as 
12 
April 1994. However, its materialization will be possible only 
after the aggregate property, which belongs to the enterprises 
to be NJSC's stock-holders, has been evaluated. (For more 
details see UBN no. 14/1994). 
  Tentative estimates appraise it at over $22 billion (in 
1992's prices). However, it is subject to great variation 
depending on evaluation approaches and methods and the number of 
affiliate enterprises to undergo the merger. 
  In the meantime, the decision on Ukrneftegaz's establishment 
has triggered ambivalent responses from the interested circles. 
  Prior to making the decision, top-placed officers of the 
State Committee for Oil and Gas repeatedly urged NJSC 
establishment as a national agent, capable of speedily resolving 
the crucial problem of Ukraine's indebtedness to Russia for its 
fuels supplied to Ukraine, as well as of accumulating enough 
means, foreign investments included, to develop the oil and gas 
industry. They did not conceal the fact that the National 
Joint-Stock Company would be a monopolist structure. Since there 
were no other options, the holding company idea had to be 
accepted. Nonetheless, in view of Ukraine's very peculiar mode 
of denationalization, which, among other things, provides for 
the State's invariably controlling parcels of stocks in all the 
supposedly denationalized enterprises, the little trivial 
peccadillo of monopolism on the part of the State per se, may be 
overlooked. 
  Since, as the State Committee for Oil and Gas maintains, the 
affiliate enterprises are supposed to retain relative 
independence on NJSC, they may well develop into the latter's 
competitors, in due time. 
  Contrary to this upper echelon mood, the grass-roots 
sentiment tends to doubt NJSC's expediency as a unified and 
integrated structure. As managers of enterprises under the 
Ukrneft (Ukraine's Oil) and Ukrgaz (Ukraine's Gas) associations 
(substructures of the State Committee for Oil and Gas) maintain, 
NJSC will likely channel the thus pooled means to targets, other 
than the enterprises' development, which will reduce to naught 
the generally laudable concept of the industry's 
denationalization and individual enterprises' privatization, as 
well as badly compromise their stabilization chances. 
  NJSC's inexpedience is further predicted on grounds, it will 
form yet another unnecessary administrative suprastructure among 
the none too few Ukraine's bureaucratic institutions. 
  Such misgivings and apprehensions are not altogether 
groundless, since the Cabinet's thinkers are rumored to be very 
busily engaged in masterminding yet another ministry 
specifically to exercise control over NJSC (along the lines of 
Russia's Ministry for Power and Fuels). 
  Presently, Ukraine's oil and gas industry has basically four 
levels of hierarchy: immediate producers, seven major pipe-line 
agencies, the Ukrgaz, Ukrneft, Ukrgazprom associations, and the 
State Committee for Oil and Gas on top of them. NJSC and 
probably the new ministry will likely make up as many as six 
levels. 
  Such a restructuring mode will likely result in renaming the 
old structures and setting up new administrative bodies. 
  As attentive observers maintain, it is hard to predict, 
which 
trend will prevail, since the two options are dictated by the 
involved parties' ambivalent and often clashing opinions, which 
make the resultant vector too dim and obscure.

  [Text] Russia's Ministry for Fuel and Power and Ukraine's 
State Committee for Oil and Gas are reported to have reached an 
agreement on tariffs for Ukrainian petroleum piping and 
transshipment services. 
  Thus, an earlier (December 1993) agreement may materialize, 
which provides for increasing Russian petroleum piping across 
Ukraine's territory to Central and West European nations from 
5.5 million tons in 1993 to 8 million tons this year. 
  The issue of transit piping and transshipment tariffs 
involving the Odessan petroleum transshipment facility remains 
unsettled, though, same as Russia's schedule of export petroleum 
piping. 
  Ukraine has agreed to lower its averaged $3 per ton tariff, 
though no exact figure has been divulged. Nonetheless, as 
spokespersons of the Ukrainian State Committee for Oil and Gas 
maintain, the deal is mutually profitable. 
  Under the Russo-Ukrainian General Agreement the Koneks firm, 
which was co-founded by major Russian petroleum extractors, has 
been granted the exclusive right to export Russian crude 
petroleum and petroleum products. 
  Russia's Transneft joint-stock company is in charge of 
piping 
petroleum to Ukraine's border. The Russian joint-stock company 
agreed specific schedules of petroleum delivery to Ukraine's 
border with its Ukrainian partner, Ukrtransneft, which is in 
charge of further Russian petroleum piping across Ukraine's 
territory to the Odessan petroleum transshipment facility. (For 
more details see UBN no. 13/1994). 
  Besides, Ukrtransneft concluded additional contracts with 
foreign firms, engaged in Russian petroleum exports, in view of 
the Odessan transshipment facility's 15 million tons a year 
capacity. 
  Currently, Ukrtransneft has such contracts signed with 
Lukoil, Telf, Stanford and Galaxy.

  [Text] As Mikhail Kovalko, chairman of the Ukrainian State 
Committee for Oil and Gas, tipped off in an interview to 
UKRINFORM's correspondent, Turkmenistan notified Ukraine on 7 
May about resumption of its natural gas supplies to Ukraine. 
  However, the entire amount, which was piped from the Central 
Asian nation, has settled in Russia, according to the Ukrgazprom 
concern's dispatching service. Its factual piping from Russia to 
Ukraine is expected to occur by 17 May. In this way, daily 
Turkmen gas piping is supposed to average 75 to 80 million cu. m 
[cubic meters]. By that time, Ukraine's delegation is to 
finalize an agreement with the Russian Gazprom supplier on 
charges for Turkmen gas transit piping through Russia's 
territory to Ukraine's border. 
  The Ukrainian delegation was in Moscow on 15 and 16 May. 
  On 19 May Gazprom's delegation is expected to arrive in Kiev 
to negotiate this and other issues of mutual interest with the 
Ukrainian Government. 
  More likely than not, the Russian delegation will push for 
Russia's hand in Ukrainian joint-stock societies to be set up as 
a result of denationalization of Ukraine's oil and gas complex 
(in the context of President Kravchuk's decree on establishment 
of the holding-type National Joint-Stock Company). 
  Turkmenistan's announcement about gas supply resumption (if 
ever Turkmen gas reaches Ukraine) probably occurred quite 
unrelated to the problem of Ukraine's indebtedness to 
Turkmenistan for the latter's natural gas supplies, though it 
was precisely this reason that Turkmenistan mentioned, when it 
terminated gas supplies to Ukraine in mid-February. 
  So far, there has been no official confirmation of the 
"Republika" concern's repayment of Ukraine's debt, which 
intention was widely rumored in March (see UBN No. 16/1994), 
since the concern was authorized to do so by the Ukrainian 
Government. Moreover, on 5 April acting Prime Minister 
Zvyahilskyy complained that he could not contact Igor Bakai, the 
concern's president, and that the government did not possess 
money enough to repay the debt on its own. 
  Should Turkmen gas supplies prove regular, Ukrgazprom would 
stock them in underground storages, as well as natural gas 
amounts, economized by domestic consumers, to be utilized during 
the fall-winter heating period. 
  In this way, Ukraine could receive about 20 billion cu. m. 
of 
Turkmen gas (1994's original figure was set at 28 billion cu. 
m.). The issue of repayment remains open, however. 
  Russian natural gas supplies within the 6 through 13 May 
period exceeded the planned amount by 247.2 million cu. m. (they 
totalled 3,959.2 million cu. m.). Their daily amount averaged 
565.6 million cu. m. 
  Ukraine's gas consumption during the same period amounted to 
1,448.3 million cu. m. versus the expected figure of 1,847.3 
million cu. m. with the daily consumption average of 906.9 
million cu. m.

  [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry has informed the 
British Foreign Office that the 6 May statement by Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev amounts to a misunderstanding. 
This is what Estonian Government Press Secretary Ain Saarna 
told journalists today. According to INTERFAX, Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev stated at a press conference on 6 May 
that 2,500 Russian servicemen will stay in Estonia so long as 
the issue of the Russian military pensioners is not resolved. 
As is known, both President Lennart Meri and Prime Minister 
Mart Laar have reacted to this statement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis by Sarmite </F>
Elerte, Ainars Dimants and Aivars Ozolins; place and date not 
given: "Somebody Has To Lead the Team Forward"] 
  [Excerpts] [Elerte] After your and Mr. Birkavs' press 
conference, at the end of last week, it was quite clear that you 
are pretty sure that Russia will admit the fact of occupation, 
as well as that Russia will comply with the concluded 
agreements. What makes you feel so positive about this? To 
what extent is this a concept conveyed by Yeltsin, Gratchev, and 
Kozyrev? Are there any democratic forces in Russia's background? 
  [Ulmanis] Mr. Birkavs gave a very precise answer at the 
press 
conference: The only thing one can be absolutely sure of is 
death. I could answer any question connected with Russia in the 
same way. Consequence in the realm of politics deals with the 
same kind of question. 
  I went to Moscow with the idea that President Yeltsin would 
talk to us for 20 minutes and then turn his back and walk away, 
and all the rest would be settled through the ordinary 
bureaucratic system -- as has happened to many country leaders 
who have visited him. Russian officials themselves warned us: 
Do not get annoyed should talks turn out to be very brief, and 
the rest is carried out by clerks. However, an hour passed, 
then another, then a third, and Yeltsin did not show any signs 
of withdrawing. He did not look tired and did not avoid any of 
my questions. I asked him all the questions I had in mind: 
Concerning the occupation, and the repressions, and Karlis 
Ulmanis [Latvia's last prewar president, grand-uncle of Guntis 
Ulmanis], and the KGB. The only question we never mentioned was 
human rights. He was in an extremely creative and rational 
mood. At first, I thought we would talk tete-a-tete, but later 
we asked our assistants to be present, so that he could 
instantly issue orders concerning all matters brought up by me 
-- on `chekist' archives, on the grave of Karlis Ulmanis, on 
admitting to Stalin's repressions in 1940 and 1949. 
  [Elerte] Also on admitting to the 1940 occupation? 
  [Ulmanis] Concerning the occupation -- as you roughly 
mentioned -- we both left this topic for another time. I had 
the feeling that we had already achieved much, and that this was 
enough for the present, otherwise the tension would have become 
too strong. It might have harmed what we had already gained. 
Yeltsin talked extensively about the tragedy of the Russian 
people, and he definitely condemned imperial thinking. On my 
way to Moscow, I was prepared for their imperial way of 
thinking, and for having to point out that Latvia is an 
independent state. But no, on his own initiative, he declared 
that Russia endeavors to do its best to eliminate imperial 
thinking. Although, he said he was not absolutely sure whether 
they will succeed. Russia is tired of internal fighting. He 
told me about Bashkiria, Tatarstan, about other autonomous 
states. He said: It is all very well that you have regained 
your independence, and we do wish to withdraw from this region 
as quickly as possible, and to settle this issue between us. 
  This might be a diplomatic game in part. We should take 
energetic and pragmatic action immediately, so that what was 
said by us would not fade into emotional memories. In any case, 
I do not have any illusions that the most difficult matters are 
already completed. The most difficult part is still ahead of 
us. This was only the first time that we undertook to form a 
new relationship with Russia, and that Russia spoke frankly with 
Latvia. 
  [Dimants] What is your opinion regarding Russia's next move 
concerning admitting to the 1940 occupation? When will 
Yeltsin's official announcement regarding this issue take place? 
  [Ulmanis] My wish is that admitting to the occupation would 
be expressed in actual support of Latvia's sovereignty -- that 
the Army would be withdrawn, and that the situation with the 
military personnel would become stable. As soon as Russia will 
prove through its actions that it respects us as a sovereign 
state, and will cease its ideological pressure on Latvia, then 
admitting to the 1940 occupation will follow as a natural result 
of eliminating the consequences of the occupation. By the way, 
one of Yeltsin's promises was that the Russian side -- as much 
as it will be possible to stop the propaganda machinery -- will 
not throw any more dirt on Latvia; the television, press, and 
embassies abroad cannot continue to refer to Latvia at every 
possible occasion as a virtually semi-fascist state. 
  I feel an internal contradiction while talking to Yeltsin, 
because I realize they are struggling to build a new country, 
with a new mentality, trying to free themselves of the heritage 
of the Soviet Union and of Soviet Russia. While they are 
building something totally new, I would be telling them at the 
same time: This something new is not sufficient; you should 
first admit to the occupation by the USSR! In private 
conversations, they do admit it. But on the state level -- we 
still have work to do. 
  [Dimants] But who admits it? Yeltsin or, as you stated at 
the press conference, in talks with others? 
  [Ulmanis] Look, I cannot be incorrect toward persons with 
whom I held confidential talks. They said: There are no 
doubts, that is how it was. But as soon as we speak on an 
official level, they are not ready to admit it. Now, I cannot 
declare openly that they have admitted the occupation, because 
if I did so, they would be forced to deny it, due to their 
internal situation. I should have given myself the benefit of 
the doubt. When one has met and talked so much on such a level, 
about one third of the contents of what was said should be kept 
to oneself, for further work in the future. In due time, it 
will develop and become public. 
  [Dimants] At the press conference you stated that in the 
near 
future there could be a change expected in this regard. What did 
you mean by that? 
  [Ulmanis] Yes, we spoke about it -- if everything will go 
smoothly with the withdrawal of the army. Also the European 
processes are very important. Both Yeltsin and I touched upon 
the NATO issue. He is thinking and having doubts. We looked at 
each other in such a way -- how would we look as partners in the 
framework of NATO. Probably it seemed somehow strange to him to 
imagine me as his partner in NATO, because I do not possess a 
single tank or a decent airplane, whereas he has plenty of them. 
  I came to two conclusions. First, we did the right thing by 
not delaying our meeting with Russia. Second, it is essential 
that Russia preserve its standpoint for the time being while the 
baby born during our talks has time to grow up. 
  I must have confidence, because somebody has to lead the 
team 
forward. The result of the battle might not be known even to 
the commander, but he still believes that he will win. I also 
believe that I shall win. When I was leaving for Moscow, I was 
feeling bad, but now I am determined not to quit the process 
which I have begun, because I have the inner conviction that the 
current year will be crucial for Latvia. Let us not make 
guesses as to whether Yeltsin will stay or not. After meeting 
with him, I am sure that neither Zhirinovskiy nor Rutskoy will 
ever take his place. For the time being, the Kremlin is ruled 
by reasonable people. 
  [Ozolins] Did you get any feeling as to who could replace 
Yeltsin, should he leave his post? 
  [Ulmanis] Yeltsin looked so firm the thought never for a 
moment occurred to me. 
  [Dimants] You mentioned you were also discussing issues 
concerning Europe and NATO. Did you feel any discouraging 
attitude toward Latvia's integration into Europe? 
  [Ulmanis] No. This was a separate question I was constantly 
analyzing -- if there were any hidden meanings. But I did not 
notice any. Naturally, before my trip, I had read many memoirs 
about visits to Russia in the 1930's and 1940's by our envoys. 
And I wondered if I shall be met with the same cunning and 
false politeness, and if in the end I shall be the loser. But I 
understood that they have many more difficult and serious 
problems, that the elite that currently holds power in Russia, 
is busy with different problems. Therefore, I thought: In the 
meantime, while they are occupied with other problems, we should 
take advantage of the moment to stabilize our position. Maybe a 
year from now they will say that they overlooked something. 
Kozyrev seemed to be quite indifferent when we talked to him. 
I did not feel that he was hiding some tactical maneuvers up 
his sleeve. Of course, it might have been a stalling tactic. 
But if it really was, then we must work with much greater 
intensity. 
  [Ozolins] You talked with Mr. Yeltsin about his possible 
visit to Riga... 
  [Ulmanis] He spoke about it very cordially, recalling his 
pleasant memories of Riga and Jurmala [seaside resort in Latvia]. 
  [Ozolins] But was it his idea? 
  [Ulmanis] When the conversation drifted to more lyrical 
topics, we talked about his previous visits to Latvia. I had to 
convey to him regards from Mr. Gorbunovs, who was his host at 
the time. Yeltsin remembered very well his stay in Jurmala and 
Riga. By the way, he said he would be pleased to have a rest 
there again. 
  [Ozolins] Do you foresee that during his visit to Riga, if 
it 
took place for instance next summer or at any other convenient 
time, Yeltsin would officially, from the rostrum -- just like he 
did in Hungary and in Poland -- let us say in front of the 
Saeima [parliament], condemn the 1940 occupation? 
  [Ulmanis] Maybe, we shall keep this in mind. We would 
welcome it. I have already been thinking of what you suggested. 
At present, I am preparing a letter to Yeltsin. At first, I 
thought it would be the usual letter of gratitude after a visit. 
We shall prepare it as such, but, with a prospect for the 
future, we shall emphasize the idea of another possible meeting 
when a deeper moral vindication could take place. As you see, I 
do not abandon this thought. 
  [Ozolins] To the last moment, Mr. Birkavs maintained that 
he will definitely not go to Moscow, but in the end he decided 
to accompany you. Was it perhaps a violation of diplomatic 
protocol in some way? 
  [Ulmanis] No. International agreements, attributed to a 
foreign army, can be signed, without the authorization of the 
Saeima, by three people -- the state president, the prime 
minister, and the minister of foreign affairs. The minister of 
foreign affairs was "buried" one day before our journey. By 
means of the "sacks" [KGB archives] the foreign minister was 
practically excluded from the game. If it was not formulated in 
the draft decision -- to give the president the powers to sign 
-- I could sign without any doubt, because in principle I do not 
need any authorization. But the Saeima rejected this 
authorization in general, because there was no quorum. 
  I could take a risk. But then a group of lawyers arrived 
from the the Saeima and said: Mr. President, you may take the 
risk, but then there will be a Constitutional Court, and we 
shall claim your signature on the documents was illegal. We 
decided with Birkavs that we shall not undertake any risky 
decisions. At the same time, if we wanted to sign the first 
document, we needed the signature of the Russian president. In 
addition, according to the Latvian Constitution, the president 
can sign any document, if it is countersigned by the government, 
because the Constitution does not foresee political 
responsibility on the side of the president. 
  Actually, it is not important, who signed the documents. The 
game is now being played on a new level, where the president and 
the government together are bearing responsibility for the 
processes that are developing in connection with the agreements. 
Both Birkavs and I do not stress who signed which agreement. 
This is now a team game. We are not having any further 
discussions because the responsibility is taken on by the entire 
team. 
  [Ozolins] I understand this, but all the same it looked a 
bit 
strange that on behalf of Russia the agreements were signed not 
by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, but by his First Deputy Soskovec. 
  [Ulmanis] Chernomyrdin had departed for Orenburg. Russia is 
a big country, and such trips are planned long in advance. Mr. 
Yeltsin said to me -- if the first deputy does not suit you, we 
can postpone all this for a few days and ask Chernomyrdin to 
come, he has no hidden agendas. Actually, the document was 
signed by the Russian Cabinet of Ministers. To exclude any 
possible doubts, Yeltsin said: Chernomyrdin will certainly come 
to your country and sign all other economic agreements. The 
prognostics can vary. Time will show, why they were so correct, 
so composed, and so calm. 
  [Elerte] How do you assess the possibility of regaining the 
missing KGB archives, which was also discussed during the Moscow 
talks? 
  [Ulmanis] Yeltsin put it this way: We have returned such 
documents to Poland, and Hungary, and there is no reason why we 
should not return them to you. This is what he said, but we do 
not know, what the Russian middle level is thinking. Maybe they 
are plotting something, and maybe it is in their interest to 
keep certain parts of the documents. There are opinions, that 
the most important documents are being kept in Moscow. In the 
next few days I shall get in touch with Mr. Skrastins [Latvian 
General Prosecutor], who on his part will get in touch with the 
Russian General Prosecutor. I think Yeltsin has already given 
orders to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other ministries 
connected with this matter. In any case, Kozyrev, Gratchev, and 
Yeltsin have promised to help. [passage omitted] 
  [Ozolins] But does it not seem now, that we have left 
Estonia 
alone, in a deadlock situation? 
  [Ulmanis] It was essential for Latvia to conclude these 
agreements because Latvia is situated in the very center of the 
Baltic region, not only politically but also militarily. The 
center of the activities of the Russian Army is located here, 
the headquarters and all the generals reside here -- all the 
arteries of the Russian Army go through Riga. If this is 
removed, who will support the infrastructure in Estonia? They 
will be forced to find a solution to this situation very soon. 
  And there is another circumstance. Maybe the ambition and 
principality of the Estonians has led them to such a position, 
from which they cannot get out. The fact that we have moved 
forward, that we have the agreements now, and that no tragedy 
has resulted from it, on the contrary -- stability has 
increased, which will help Estonians assess the situation and 
accept a normal solution. [passage omitted] 
  [Dimants] To what degree, when speaking of these problems, 
do 
you represent the LZS [Farmers Union]? 
  [Ulmanis] None at all. I am simply careful not to forget 
about the future. I think of what will occur in two or five 
years. Sometimes, we have consultations, but usually they do not 
ask my advice, and I do not pressure them, because I have 
formally refused to participate in the activities of the party. 
  [Elerte] To phrase the question concerning a possible crisis 
more precisely -- I understand that currently you do not feel 
that you should seek a person who would be entrusted to 
construct a new government? 
  [Ulmanis] No, I have no such feeling. Yet, I am thinking 
about it. I have to consider such a possibility. I had very 
uneasy thoughts when the deputies voted with their feet [they 
left the session and there was no quorum]. They had calculated 
then, that the opposition will always be able to win, by voting 
with their feet. Even if 49 deputies would vote "for," and not 
one would be against or abstain, there would be no possibility 
of accepting a decision when the rest vote with their feet. 
That night I understood -- now they have found a trick, and if 
they repeat it again and again, I shall be forced to announce 
that the Saeima is not able to continue its work. 
  [Ozolins] Mr. President, are you not afraid that the 
opposition might use you as a means of overthrowing the 
government, if they were to set their minds to it? 
  [Ulmanis] Well, there is a deadlock. If the opposition acts 
in this way, it is refusing to work. The deputies have been 
elected by the people, and I have the moral grounds to dismiss 
them. Still, I hope they do not go that far, because the people 
will simply scorn them. Moreover, some of them are quite 
reasonable people. I think they will have the reason to now 
behave in such a manner. Besides, I am not sure that the 
opposition would be pleased if parliament were dismissed. 
  [Elerte] What will be the next important question for the 
president, in which he could express his fundamental and, in a 
sense, decisive opinion? 
  [Ulmanis] Upon my return from Moscow, I thought to myself -- 
may God allow me to work on this Russian question during my last 
two years in office. I would like it to be possible to resolve 
all of these problems, to stabilize our relationship, and to 
prove that the fourth agreement will not turn out as envisioned 
by the opposition. We still have to await ratification. I can 
tell you frankly, that no one is going to establish a 
joint-venture with Russia on the basis of a hospital. No one 
intends to give away apartments or building sites. 
  I think that, from a political point of view, Russia needed 
these agreements. For the military personnel, it was like a 
drop of water in the ocean. They just had to prove to the world 
that this is yet another Russian victory: We achieved the legal 
protection of our people and we did it in a civilized manner, 
hurrah! 
  From the point of view of recognizing the 1940 occupation, 
we 
have kind of lost, but at the same time we have grabbed hold of 
a gigantic lever -- we can decide for ourselves what the fate 
will be of these military personnel in Latvia. 
  The institution of president in Latvia is the weakest in 
East Europe, in terms of legal backing, and has the least amount 
of power. I have only moral levers -- moral categories, if you 
will -- at my disposal. It may be that the Latvian president, 
regardless of whether it is me or somebody else, by introducing 
the institution of a moral category, will turn it into a 
powerful force in our country. To me, this might show the 
cleverness of our Constitution. Because, if I had the power to 
give orders to the administrative branch, I might have chosen 
the easiest way -- to summon, order, and punish if something has 
not been done. But I do not have the power to give orders to 
anyone. I can only show the way toward fulfilling my ideas and 
aims. 
  [Dimants] Returning to the question of a candidate for the 
post of prime minister -- would he come from the right wing of 
parliament? 
  [Ulmanis] No, not at the moment. Let them work, let them 
create their shadow cabinet. At present, I do not see anyone in 
the right wing who could form a team and lead the country. 
  We can quarrel with one another, but we have no rights to 
risk anything when it comes to the most important factors -- 
Latvia, the Latvian people, and the future of our state. In my 
opinion, the right-wing forces do not often understand this, 
they are just playing with any toy they can get their hands on. 
They do not treat anything seriously. 
  You see, after the vote of confidence, the government became 
even more "leftist," because the result of the vote was decided 
by the "Concord for Latvia" faction. This time, it was the left 
wing that saved the government. They unmasked me, before I had 
time to frighten them. The Concord understood that the moment 
the vote came out negative, I would have had Birkavs form a new 
government. They were afraid the we would succeed in creating 
an even more successful government, and they would remain the 
losers. That explains why they voted for us in the 
no-confidence motion. 
  [Dimants] Will the conclusion of the agreements with Russia 
strengthen the government and the coalition? 
  [Ulmanis] That all depends on their implementation. 
  I would like the Farmers Union, in its opinions and 
political 
thinking, to become more stable. Sometimes something comes over 
them, and half of them "for" something and half vote "against" 
it. 
  Still, there are people who are against these agreements, 
people for whom they are inconvenient. The withdrawal of the 
Russian Army was the center of all our hatred and problems. 
Now, all of a sudden, this focal point has vanished. The right 
wing has lost their footing. They have to look elsewhere, for 
something new on which to harp. I do not know yet what, if 
anything, they will find. If they start to look for national 
harmony, this could become their focus. 
  [Ozolins] The question of citizenship will be coming up 
soon. 
  [Ulmanis] I am of the view that there is a rational enough 
model for this, and we should accept it sometime in May. We now 
have a positive image throughout Europe, and they are sending us 
cables of congratulations. If we, for example, accept this law 
in a couple weeks' time and Russia begins to howl, it will not 
be easy for Europe to turn against us. 
  [Elerte] If the West views these agreements as an inevitable 
and clever concession on the part of Latvia, the pressure on the 
citizenship law may not be very strong? 
  [Ulmanis] We often think that we have won the war, that we 
have at least the same power as Russia, that we are talking to 
the USSR or, at least, to Red Russia. We keep forgetting, 
however, that this is a new, democratic Russia, which is 
practically our only salvation. We should help them in every 
way possible, but this is seldom emphasized. We have now added 
to Russia's political prestige. Being small -- almost as small 
as the tip of a needle -- we have helped build the international 
prestige of Russia. They understand and appreciate this. 
  [Dimants] I would like to put a question to you concerning 
the right-wing forces. Is there a threat that they could turn 
and support a socialist way of developing the Latvian economy? 
  [Ulmanis] It is perfectly clear that one cannot last long on 
nationalism alone. Nonetheless, the intellectual sector is also 
essential. We should find our approach to the young people. 
Thus far, we have neglected this aspect -- the aspect of 
molding the young people of our country. We model ourselves 
after the old ones -- Berklavs, Lambergs, Krastins, Kirsteins, 
and Milbergs. I can name hundreds of people about whom 
everything is clear. But where are the young people from 1989, 
from 1990? Where will they lead Latvia? 
  This spring, I shall begin a new tour around Latvia. It will 
be orientated a little differently -- more toward intellectuals 
and young people. Human emotions are no longer sufficient for 
me, and I seek something more difficult. Just in this 
situation, right after concluding the agreements with Russia, I 
wish to rush to Aluksne, to Gulbene, and meet thousands of 
people, looking them in the eyes. Let them express their 
dissatisfaction right away -- I am of the personal conviction 
that I shall be able to explain my actions to them -- to all 
those who are willing to listen. 
  You know, sometimes I think about the popularity rating of 
the president. I would like it to reflect only this one aspect. 
I am indifferent to the other directions. I would like to feel 
that on the basis of this rating, the Farmers Union will get 
stronger. Then I could be sure that I have achieved my mission, 
and can put an end to it.

  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Kazakhstan wants to invite 
U.S. experts to dismantle Russian-made nuclear missiles which it 
had inherited from the former Soviet Union and the decision 
causes concern among the Russian military. 
  "The access of experts of third countries to Russian missile 
complexes for their dismantling contradicts the Russian-Kazakh 
agreement on strategic nuclear forces and the treaty on military 
cooperation", Aleksandr Volkov, first deputy commander-in-chief 
of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces, told TASS on Tuesday. 
  Russian experts are currently removing nuclear warheads from 
the missiles, extracting them from silos and preparing for 
transportation, according to Volkov who added that Russia had 
pledged to transfer to its territory all nuclear components for 
elimination by May 1, 1995. He stressed that financial aspects 
of dismantling and elimination have been fixed in a separate 
Russian- Kazakh agreement. 
  In the meantime, three U.S. companies want to eliminate the 
SS-18 missiles in Kazakhstan and are planning to request the 
U.S. Congress to appropriate 75 million dollars for that, 
according to Kazakh mass media which reported that the main bulk 
of the missiles is to be destroyed, while ten of them are to be 
used as spacecraft carriers. The Kazakh-U.S. cooperation idea in 
the sphere has emerged after the visit of President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev to the United States. 
  The invitation to U.S. experts to dismantle Russian missiles 
affects not only the Russian interests, but also of missile 
constructors in other CIS countries. According to Aleksandr 
Piskunov, deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma committee on 
defence, the Kazakh decision ignores the right to intellectual 
property and thus contradicts international norms.

  [Text] Poland, Hungary, Ukraine, and the United States in 
June and July will be doing the first military exercise under 
NATO's Partnership for Peace scheme, Ukrainian Defense Minister 
Vitaliy Radetskyy said. 
  He told a news conference in Kiev on Monday [16 May] that 
each country would detail a motorized infantry company for the 
exercise, to take place in Poland. 
  Radetskyy said Ukraine's Odessa and Cis-Carpathian Military 
Districts had already prepared training grounds for future 
Partnership for Peace exercises. 
  He said none of the participant states should be allowed to 
"enjoy priority" in the scheme, which "some of the states seek." 
  Earlier the same day Radetskyy said "the content of the 
neutral status of Ukraine needs a more precise definition." 
"Our noninterference in efforts to ensure the security of the 
common European home would be difficult to understand," he said 
at a news conference held for him and his visiting Austrian 
counterpart, Werner Fasslabend. "It is not only the security of 
Ukraine that is our concern. What's happening to our neighbors 
also concerns us. If there's trouble in a neighboring state, it 
may speread to our country too," he said.

  [Text] A government delegation headed by Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov returned to Kiev yesterday from the 
United States. A news conference devoted to the results of the 
visit was held at Boryspil airport. Our correspondent Yuriy 
Horban has the details. 
  [Horban] Aside from Valeriy Shmarov, the delegation 
comprised high-level officials from the Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs, Machine-Building, and Defense Industry and Conversion, 
as well as of the National Space Agency of Ukraine. As the 
deputy prime minister noted, the wide range of issues discussed 
in the United States primarily included Ukraine's joining the 
international convention controlling the proliferation of 
missile technologies and equipment, and its implementation of 
provisions stemming from START I. Also discussed were 
possibilities for cooperation in the power industry, 
particularly, in nuclear power engineering and the conversion of 
defense enterprises. Summarizing the negotiations held in the 
United States, Valeriy Shmarov said the following: 
  [Begin Shmarov recording] There is a certain degree of 
success in our cooperation with the United States -- its 
recognition of Ukraine as a partner. The U.S. Administration 
noted in a joint statement that Ukraine has become a reliable 
partner. There is no attitude of, as the saying goes, an elder 
or stronger brother -- regular work based on parity is being 
carried out instead. Regarding our cooperation in RKRT 
[expansion unknown], we signed a memorandum. For the U.S. side, 
it was signed by Vice President Gore, from ours, I was 
commissioned to sign it. The memorandum virtually opens for 
Ukraine the possibility to conduct studies, as well as to launch 
production and operation in the space-missile industry. This is 
very important. I believe that it is a very important document 
that makes it possible for our state to use and develop its 
potential. A second aspect important for the future is that, 
having analyzed the implementation of commitments stemming from 
the tripartite declaration [on nuclear disarmament] and the 
START treaty, the U.S. and Ukrainian Governments issued a joint 
statement, in which Ukraine's actions and consistency in nuclear 
disarmament were praised. The fact that the United States 
announced in the joint, bilateral statement that all missiles 
pointed at Ukraine will be retargeted by 30 May, I regard as our 
important achievement; not only political but also a practical 
achievement. 
  Regarding conversion, pilot projects were assigned, and one 
of the projects -- concerning cooperation between the 
Westinghouse and Kharprom corporations -- has already been 
signed, meaning that the first step toward real cooperation has 
been taken. In general, I would say that we have begun real 
work in all directions of our cooperation, meaning that we are 
moving from political intentions toward practical cooperation.

  [Text] Charles Freeman, assistant secretary on regional 
security at the U.S. Defense Department, is visiting Estonia 
today. The U.S. visitors had a meeting with Prime Minister Mart 
Laar, Defense Minister Indrek Kannik, Foreign Minister Juri 
Luik, and Defense Forces commander Major General Aleksandr 
Einseln. Freeman said at a news conference that during the day 
a substantial amount of work had been done in Estonia. He 
appreciated the structure of the Estonian defense system and 
noted that the United States supports comprehensively Estonia's 
integration with NATO. Indrek Kannik said at a news conference 
that issues to do with the Partnership for Peace program had 
formed the focus of their discussions as well as U.S. assistance 
towards the formation of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion. 
Kannik noted that Estonia is now able to obtain military 
equipment also from the United States, an option that did not 
exist previously. Tonight President Lennart Meri will also 
receive the U.S. visitors.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaly Trubetskoy and 
others] 
  [Text] Russia has joined preparations for the political 
part of the Naples summit which will involve eight countries, 
Interfax was told Tuesday by Deputy Russian Foreign Minister, 
Sergey Lavrov, who recently returned from Rome where he took 
part in the meeting of deputy foreign ministers. 
  He said that the political part of the summit will involve 
eight countries. As to the economic part of the summit, 
countries will act according to the formula "seven plus one". 
  Obviously, the G-7 will consider behind closed doors the 
macro-economic situation in the world, for example, the currency 
and financial relations. 
  At the meeting in line with the formula "seven plus one" the 
delegates will consider the pace of cooperation in support of 
the Russian reforms, he said. "We need concrete deeds and 
further shifts to materialize the understandings which were 
reached in the past years. I do not think we need more aid 
packages or graphic figures. Now it is a matter of the quality 
of cooperation, or what could be described as 
non-discrimination, open markets, the lifting of artificial 
obstacles on the road of Russia goods, services and capital." 
  Lavrov believes that one should not change the official name 
for the Group of Seven. The economic part is the basis for the 
group's activities. The "political eight" is a reality and the 
term used during the preparations for the summit, as well as 
during the correspondence between Russian President Yeltsin and 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev with their counterparts, 
he said. 
  The deputy foreign minister is confident that joining the 
G-7 
in political terms would enhance Russia's ability to exert 
influence on world political processes. "Russia influences world 
politics regardless of its membership in one organization or 
another," Lavrov said. 
  He referred to the foreign ministers' conference on Bosnia 
held in Geneva recently as an example. "This kind of 
qualitatively new partnership, when the leading powers work out 
a common attitude and seek to pursue it through different 
organizations -- the U.N., the CSCE, and the like -- reflects 
our influence as well as our and our partners' readiness to take 
each other's interests into account and act jointly. This is 
the essence of what we call the political G-8 and multilateral 
strategic partnership." 
  "Considering the fast development of events on the world 
scene, it's hard to say what will be the essence of political 
statement to be issued by the summit in Naples on behalf of its 
chairman, the Italian Prime Minister," said Interfax's 
interviewee. "But the general topics are already evident -- the 
situation in Bosnia, conflicts in Central America and in Africa, 
the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula, human rights...," 
he said. 
  "Russia maintains a full-scale political dialogue, turning 
or 
already turned into partnership, with each of the G-7 
countries," Lavrov pointed out. "Such relations have their own 
specificities, of course, but this does not prevent us from 
finding common approaches to international problems. There are 
no fundamental differences or substantial disparities in the 
approaches to international affairs -- to, say, 
non-proliferation problems, peace-keeping, the efforts to 
strengthen and raise the effectiveness of the U.N., regional 
conflicts and crises," he said.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Portanskiy article: "Yeltsin Will No Longer Be </F>
Just a Guest at the G-7 Meeting in Naples"] 
  [Text] World news agencies have reported that the world's 
seven leading industrial powers have finally consented to 
Russia's full and equal participation in the political part of 
the next G-7 summit to be held in Naples in July. 
  This means that President Boris Yeltsin will be able to 
partly cast off the status of a guest, which he had at the 
previous meetings in Munich and Tokyo, and to start feeling that 
he is on equal terms with the members of the prestigious world 
club. 
  As much as a year ago, before the last G-7 meeting in the 
Japanese capital, Moscow had advocated that Russia should take a 
full and equal part in the political debate and that a common 
statement by the eight leaders should be adopted on its results. 
But there was insufficient time then to work out a new formula 
for our involvement in the work of the summit, and the scheme 
was not realized. 
  Moscow has now advanced the same initiative in good time, 
and 
it has been supported, in principle, in the capitals of the 
seven most developed states. In fact, however, there is no full 
coincidence of opinions among the members of the club concerning 
the form of Russia's admission to it. 
  Different opinions exist in respect of the formula for 
Russia's participation in G-7 conferences: "Seven plus one" or 
"eight," Japanese Foreign Minister K. Kakizawa declared 
recently. But, in any case, Tokyo believes that Russia must 
play a constructive role as a member of the world community. 
This politely streamlined wording conceals, in actual fact, the 
special position of the Land of the Rising Sun. 
  A whole number of Japanese leaders, including Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, say that it is "too soon" at present to speak of 
granting the Russian Federation full and equal membership of the 
group of seven leading industrial powers and that they should 
confine themselves at this stage to the "seven plus one" 
formula, on whose basis Moscow has been admitted to regular G-7 
summits since 1992. Tokyo's main argument here is that the 
Russian Federation is a recipient of international aid, which is 
being given to it precisely by members of the G-7 club. 
Therefore it would allegedly be strange to see donor states and 
a recipient state sitting at the same table on equal terms. 
  This logic is far from impeccable, however. Russia, as our 
top government figures emphasize, occupies a special position 
because, on the one hand, it needs support for the reforms 
while, on the other hand, it is a donor itself in respect of the 
CIS republics and some developing countries. The burden of this 
aid is no less than that of the G-7 in respect of Russia. In 
order to prevent unnecessary debate and misunderstandings 
arising in this sphere, it is necessary to record Russia's 
credits to the republics of the former Union as credits of 
international financial organizations. This position is held 
both by Moscow and by the IMF leadership. 
  While acknowledging Russia's leading role in world affairs, 
particularly in settling the conflict in the Balkans, 
nevertheless Tokyo would not like to admit it yet to full and 
equal participation in G-7 meetings even in a curtailed form, in 
other words only in the political part of the debate, until it 
has secured some concessions on the issue of the "northern 
territories." 
  Moscow, for its part, certainly is not seeking to force 
events, realizing that conditions are not yet ripe for 
full-scale participation in meetings of the seven leading world 
powers -- this requires more serious market transformations in 
the economy. But, at the same time, Russia cannot wait, as in 
former times, for all the chief issues to be discussed without 
it and for them to invite its leader only afterward and to brief 
him on the decisions adopted.

  [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin said that Russia and the Caucasus are inseparable and 
added that the dreams of Caucasian peoples for well-being and 
flourishment can come true only through solidarity in 
constructing a democratic society, through public and 
interethnic accord and civic peace. 
  "In our conscience Russia and the Caucasus are inseparably 
linked notions. One cannot be imagined without the other", 
Yeltsin said in an address to the Caucasian peoples on Tuesday 
in connection with the 130th annivesary of the end of the 
Caucasian war which resulted in the incorporation of the 
Caucasus into the Russian empire. 
  "The events of a more than a century-long history return us 
to those years when the interests of the Russian empire, Great 
Britain, France, Iran and Turkey clashed in the struggle for the 
Caucasus. All those states bear a share of moral responsibility 
for the sufferings of the highlanders", the president said. 
  Yeltsin admitted that in various times the Caucasian war was 
assessed in different ways. "At present, when Russia is building 
a law-governed state and recognises the priority of human 
values, a possibility emerges to objectively assess the 
Caucasian war as courageous struggle of the peoples of the 
Caucasus not only for survival on their own land, but also for 
the preservation of their self-styled culture, the best traits 
of the national character". 
  The president added that the problems inherited from the 
Caucasian war, including the return of descendants of Caucasian 
refugees back to their historic motherland, should be solved at 
the international level through negotiations of all the 
interested parties. 
  The Caucasus should be "forever with Russia" -- these words 
are dear for every Russian, Yeltsin stressed.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Fyodor Ignatov] </F>
  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] 17 May TASS -- "The special 
services of Kazakhstan and Russia have never worked against each 
other, nor will they do it in the future," Director of the 
Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey Stepashin 
told a press conference here after signing several documents on 
cooperation between the special services of the two countries. 
Stepashin added that if Russia did not help set up 
counterintelligence services in the CIS countries, this would 
have been done by others. "The Russian Federation is least of 
all interested in this," Stepashin said. 
  An agreement on cooperation and interaction between the 
former Russian Security Ministry and the Kazakh KGB was signed 
for the first time in March 1992. However, as it was noted 
during the press conference, no mechanism for its implementation 
was worked out and the important document remained paralysed. 
It was of a purely declarative nature. The protocols first 
signed in Moscow and now in Alma Ata [Almaty] give it concrete 
substance. 
  The heads of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service 
and the Kazakh National Security Committee have signed protocols 
in Alma Ata [Almaty] on cooperation in combatting international 
terrorism, in ensuring the safety of civilian air traffic, in 
conducting economic counterintelligence operations and 
combatting smuggling, as well as protocols on joint actions to 
combat drug trafficking and corruption, to make effective use, 
in mutual interests, the operational and technical facilities of 
the radio-counterintelligence units and to ensure the security 
of special military and other international railway carriages. 
It was noted during the press conference that such broad 
cooperation was undertaken for the first time in the CIS 
countries. 
  Replying to an ITAR-TASS question, Stepashin said that his 
current visit to Alma-Ata [Almaty] was planned in advance and 
was in no way linked with the signing in Dzhambyl on 12 May of 
the agreement on operational interaction between the special 
services of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. "Kazakhstan 
is an independent state and it decides itself whom to cooperate 
with," Stepashin added. 
  This statement was confirmed by sat Tokpakbayev, chairman of 
the Kazakh National Security Committee. The special services of 
Kazakhstan, he noted, have established close contacts with their 
colleagues in the United States, Great Britain, France, FRG, and 
several other countries. They are constantly coordinating their 
actions to combat international terrorism. This work is not 
directed against any third country. 
  Stepashin and Tokpakbayev made no bones of the fact that 
there were quite a few problems yet in the difficult work to 
coordinate the actions of the special services of their two 
countries, because it was quite a new area of cooperation. The 
heads of the special services of Russia and Kazakhstan are sure 
that all the problems, cropping up on their way, will be 
settled, because there is a mutual desire to do it.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo 16 May TASS -- Uzbek President Islam Karimov, 
who arrived in Japan on his first visit on Monday [16 May], is 
confident that his four-day visit to Tokyo will enable to create 
a reliable basis for the development of economic ties between 
the two countries. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS Karimov said that "Uzbekistan 
has tremendous resources of raw materials, and Japan, in turn, 
possesses the most advanced modern technologies. "It is in the 
interests of both countries to join our resources," Karimov said. 
  He pointed out that no bilateral political agreements would 
be signed during the visit. According to the Uzbek president, a 
joint statement would be adopted as a result of his talks with 
the Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. The document will 
contain the main principles Japan and Uzbekistan will abide by 
in bilateral relations," the Uzbek president said. 
  Addressing representatives of Japanese business circles on 
Monday at a meeting arranged by the Uzbek-Japanese economic 
committee, Karimov laid the emphasis on the fact that Japan and 
Uzbekistan, whose trade turnover in 1993 amounted to $58 
million, have all prerequisites for the development of economic 
cooperation. 
  However, Karimov refrained from commenting on the problem of 
high taxes levied on foreign enterprises in Uzbekistan, which 
Tokyo believes to be one of the main factors impeding Japanese 
investments into the Uzbek economy. 
  In his speech the Uzbek president pointed out that Japan, 
like Uzbekistan, is an Asian country and there are many factors 
uniting the people of the two countries. "We have great 
respect for the purpose-oriented people of Japan and we want to 
learn from them," the Uzbek president said. 
  Upon completion of the meeting a ceremony of signing an 
agreement on cooperation between the Uzbek-Japanese Committee 
for Economic Cooperation and the Japanese-Uzbek Economic 
Committee was held. The document proclaims the intention of 
both sides to promote the development of economic cooperation 
between the two countries, carry out an exchange of experts and 
look for ways of resoloving problems impeding the development of 
bilateral economic relations and submit corresponding reports to 
the Government of Uzbekistan and Japan.

  [Text] Baku (16 May) TURAN: On 14 May the speaker of 
Parliament, Rasul Guliyev, spoke on national TV. As was earlier 
reported, the opposition accused him of "betraying interests of 
Azerbaijan" when he signed the Bishkek protocol. He rejected 
these accusations and said that he signed the Bishkek protocol 
"since there is no other way out of the situation." 
  At the same time, Guliyev accused the opposition of 
attempting to seize power and warned that they will bear a 
responsibility for that. 
  The statement by Rasul Guliyev coincided with an assault by 
an armed group on the headquarters of the National Independence 
Party, the closure of the independent television channel, "BMT," 
and an order from Baku's mayor Alakhverdiyev for evacuating 
"AZADLIG," the opposition newspaper, 
  From their premises [sentence as received]. It should be 
mentioned that all the abovementioned organs of the media and 
parties have been severely criticizing Rasul Guliyev over the 
past days due to his signing of the Bishkek protocol. 
  Beginning on 14 May, the police took the control over the 
building where the AZADLIG editorial offices are located (for 
the third time this year) and warned the employees that they 
must evacuate the building. The leadership of the newspaper was 
not presented officially represented with an order by Baku's 
mayor. 
  The authorities are demanding the evacuation from the 
premises by the following organizations: TURAN News Agency, 
Azerbaijan's Centre for Democratic Reforms, Centre for Strategic 
Researches, AZADLIG newspaper and Polyglot International Centre. 
All the above-mentioned organizations are independent and 
non-governmental.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" Report No. 19 of 12 May 1994] </F>
  [Text] At the end of April the Estonian President Lennart 
Meri received at Kadriorg Palace in Tallinn a group of Russian 
journalists invited to Estonia by the Foreign Ministry. During 
the meeting the president answered questions from Aleksandras 
Budris and Boris Grishchenko of INTERFAX. 
  Corr.: Mr. President, what do you think of the present state 
of Estonian-Russian relations? 
  Lennart Meri: Thank God, the bitterness, the sense of insult 
which Estonians felt for Russia are disappearing. I think that 
the psychologically most difficult period in our relations was 
in 1988-89 when the local Russian community found itself in an 
absolutely new position. 
  Russians in Estonia, mostly unconsciously, considered 
themselves proponents of state policies, kulturtregers [as 
received] in a way. It was insulting for us to hear that before 
occupation Estonia was an illiterate country. Such were the 
convictions of persons who knew little even about Russian 
culture and history. They would work for five years on the 
Baykal-Amur railway, then for five years somewhere in West 
Siberia. They did not take root anywhere as they were always 
after big money. They never cared about the state in which they 
left the places which they "developed," as it was said in those 
days. 
  The rapid change of the past few years took many people 
unawares. I am very glad that our northern coolness never gave 
cause for real clashes. The well-organized rallies of Estonians 
served as a model for the meetings of the Russian community. I 
am satisfied with the fact that in Estonia we can speak calmly, 
in a civilized manner of the problems that naturally exist now. 
  However, two years ago I was more optimistic in this 
respect. 
I thought that all the existing problems could be resolved in a 
peaceful and friendly way, even the ones inherited from the 
criminal agreements between Stalin and Hitler. I believed that 
we could disregard the past and switch to normal relations. 
  It so happens that there has never been hatred or prejudice 
between us in our history. The relations were quite good and 
normal. In the Middle Ages old believers persecuted in Russia 
always found refuge in Estonia and could peacefully follow their 
religious canons. We want the same today. These aspirations 
are not shared by everyone in Russia or Estonia, because the 
extremism on one side always arouses extremism on the other. 
  We are realistic enough, though, to realize that Russia will 
always remain our closest neighbor. And from our common past we 
would want to keep the positive, not negative experience. Here 
we could recall the influence St. Petersburg, which was a 
leading center of European culture, had on Estonia. The 
cultural ties between Tallinn and St. Petersburg remain strong. 
  Corr.: Are you satisfied with Estonian-Russian talks? How 
do you think they could be stepped up and channelled to concrete 
decisions? 
  L.M.: I cannot say that I am satisfied with the state of 
Russian-Estonian negotiations. The recent 18th round marked the 
second anniversary of the process. Naturally we would want to 
advance much faster. 
  I get the impression that if for two years delegations are 
arguing about details, it becomes natural to go deeper and 
deeper and get submerged under these details. There is the 
danger of losing the most important in these arguments - the 
purpose for which we are negotiating. 
  I think that my meeting with President Yeltsin could break 
this vicious circle. Both sides can openly speak of their 
willingness to establish not simply neighborly but friendly 
relations in all spheres beginning with the economy and ending 
with culture. 
  Corr.: Do you have direct contacts with Yeltsin? 
  L.M.: We exchange letters. This does not mean, of course, 
that a postman knocks on my door. It is usually the Russian 
ambassador who brings me messages from Boris Yeltsin. 
  Corr.: Lately there has been talk in Estonian political 
circles about the need to invite Finland as a mediator to 
Russian-Estonian negotiations. What is your opinion of the 
proposal? 
  L.M.: I welcome any step that would improve relations 
between Estonia and Russia. I think the mediation of an 
experienced politician, the President of Finland Martti 
Ahtisaari, could to a certain extent disperse the depressing 
atmosphere at the talks. I want to repeat that for two years 
despite regular meetings the delegations have made virtually no 
progress. 
  Martti Ahtisaari has declared that if Russia and Estonia 
wish 
so, he is ready to try to use his ample experience of working 
with the United Nations. I know that President Ahtisaari is 
closely linked with the UN. I do not doubt that the 
organization will also help us in this respect. 
  I would like to remark that the withdrawal of troops from 
Estonia and Latvia would benefit Russia itself. I am convinced 
that after the withdrawal economic relations between our two 
countries will grow more active. And this means that we are 
speaking of mutual benefit, not a victory of one side over the 
other. 
  Estonia is a small country but it is also capable of 
benefitting such a continent as Russia. Take for example, our 
geographical location, our good sea ports. Can one say today 
that the port of Rotterdam belongs to just one country? It 
belongs to the whole of Europe and serves many countries. Hence 
the Swiss, the Hungarians or the Austrians will never think of 
conquering it in order to break a window into Europe. 
  There remains a strong tendency of thinking in 19th century 
categories in Russia. Estonia wants this stage to end and see 
Russia as a modern European nation get down to finding spheres 
of active cooperation with both big and small countries. I am 
sure that this time is slowly but steadily approaching. 
  Corr.: What do you think of the differences between Estonia 
and Russia on the border problem? 
  L.M.: I will try to give a very cautious answer to this 
important question. In 1940 the border between Russia and 
Estonia was absolutely different and it was drawn in keeping 
with the treaty signed in 1920 in our university town Tartu. 
(The town was founded in the 11th century by the Russian Grand 
Prince Yaroslav the Wise and was part of Russia for almost 900 
years -- INTERFAX.) The borderline was to the east of the 
present one. 
  However, "the father of nations" Josef Jugashvili (Stalin) 
with an arbitrary hand took away part of Estonian territory in 
1944. The territory that went to Russia was very small -- 
approximately 5 percent of Estonia. It is even smaller on the 
Russian scale. Still it is of great emotional significance for 
Estonians. 
  It might sound strange but the collection of folklore in 
Estonia is a kind of a national sport. That area which is 
called Setumaa after the Setu people living is a treasure-box of 
folklore. I can compare it with Central Karelia where Finnish 
folklore experts collected the most colorful parts of the 
Finnish national epic "Kalevala." 
  We know that in modern Europe borders are a very delicate 
matter. It is like Pandora's box, which is probably best left 
closed. This constitutes a sphere in which we should look for 
and find a reasonable compromise. 
  It is possible to simply put off the matter for five or ten 
years finding some civilized solution to keep a normal border, 
not an iron curtain. 
  The border should equally protect Estonia and Russia from 
criminals, smugglers, drug and arms trade, from everything that 
can provoke a conflict. It should be a good filter and assume 
European nature. 
  Corr.: How do you think the problems of non-Estonians, 
non-citizens can be resolved? 
  L.M.: I do not think the question should be resolved by 
politicians. The choice of citizenship is the right and duty of 
each concrete person. It is a very intimate decision. Let 
every person decide which country his heart longs for. 
  Probably we have failed to explain in simple and friendly 
words how the problems should be tackled. There have also been 
mistakes on the other side. Some Russian politicians thought 
that they have the right to act as guardians and speak on behalf 
of Russians, Ukrainians, Georgians living in Estonia. This 
aroused mixed feelings among those people -- Georgians, Kazakhs, 
Ukrainians as well as Russians many of whom are descendants of 
Estonian citizens and have no problems with getting full 
citizenship now. 
  Many Russians are quite loyal to Estonia even though we have 
not reached the stable atmosphere that was inherent in pre-war 
Estonia where even frontdoors were not locked up. 
  I could compare this big group of people to a column the 
beginning of which clearly knows the direction while the people 
in the tail are doubtful: what should be done? 
  All these are practical difficulties. They can and probably 
have aroused bewilderment. I think it is an open secret that 
Estonian bureaucracy is no better than Russian. The 
comparatively simple matters that could have been resolved two 
years ago took the bureaucrats unawares as always. 
  When it is said that non-Estonians in Estonia should defend 
their rights, I ask: what particular rights? Our opponents 
find it difficult to answer the question, this is even more 
difficult for us. It is good that our northern placidity has 
allowed to keep the debate peaceful and civilized. 
  Corr.: What do you think of the role of NATO in the world 
today? 
  L.M.: For decades Europe was divided by the Berlin wall. 
NATO, "an instrument of treacherous imperialists for capturing 
the Soviet Union," was on one side of the wall, the Warsaw 
Treaty Organization existed on the other "to rebuff the 
treacherous imperialists." 
  Then one fine day the wall disappeared. The peoples that 
used to be under the iron fist of the Soviet aggressive policy 
restored their independence. But NATO remained and has no 
enemies now. Naturally in this fundamentally different world the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization wondered about its mission. 
I think it should become a parallel body of the United Nations. 
  NATO does not have adversaries, except seats of instability, 
that might grow into sources of major international conflicts. 
In other words, the alliance has transformed from a military 
bloc into a kind of a fire brigade. It acts in a disciplined 
and coordinated way. Its might is not directed against anyone, 
it is meant to protect international stability. That is why our 
attitude to NATO is quite trusting. 
  Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania can set up a peace-making 
battalion together. The tragedy of Yugoslavia has proved once 
again that a peaceful Europe where human rights are truly 
guaranteed and social problems are resolved step by step is 
being born in pain.

  [Text] Tallinn, 13 May, BNS -- Prime Minister Mart Laar 
returned Thursday [12 May] night from a working visit to the 
United Kingdom. During the visit Laar and Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd signed intergovernmental agreements on reciprocal 
promotion and protection of investments and on avoidance of 
double taxation and prevention of tax evasion. 
  Government spokesman Ain Saarna told reporters Hurd 
emphasized at the meeting with the Estonian premier that Russian 
troops must pull out from Estonia without setting extra 
conditions. Other subjects Laar and Hurd touched upon were 
Estonia's prospective European Union membership, defense 
cooperation between the two countries, and purchasing equipment 
for the Estonian border guard. 
  President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development Jacques de Larosiere hosted Thursday a luncheon in 
honor of the Estonian premier. The two reached agreement in 
principle on setting up risk capital and trade development 
capital funds for Estonia. Laar had yesterday a meeting also 
with the British Industry Confederation. 
  While staying in Great Britain, Laar received a letter from 
Prime Minister John Major expressing his country's firm support 
for Estonia's integration into European structures and for the 
demand that Russian troops be withdrawn from Estonia by 31 
August 1994. 
  The Estonian premier met also with Minister of State Douglas 
Hogg. Saarna said Hogg, too, stated that he supports 
unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops and Estonia's 
integration into Europe.

  [Text] Chairman of the Trade Unions Central League Raivo 
Paavo expressed his "amazement" at some claims of Prime Minister 
Mart Laar made in London last week. 
  Laar was quoted as saying that the government should sell 
everything possible to private owners, irrespective of price. 
The premier also allegedly claimed that granting excessive 
rights to the trade unions may threaten the state's economy. 
  Paavo pointed out that such claims could be made by a 
right-wing politician, but not "a prime minister of a democratic 
state, a leader of a coalition government which includes Social 
Democrats." He also pointed out that the premier's statements 
contradict the Estonian law on privatisation which stipulates 
profitable sale of state property. As for the rights of the 
trade unions, Paavo stressed that the Estonian trade unions obey 
the Estonian laws as well as the conventions of the 
International Labour Organisation, ratified by the Riigikogu 
[parliament].

  [Text] Foreign Minister Juri Luik held a news conference 
on Friday [13 May], describing his visits to Warsaw, Brussels, 
and Luxembourg last week. 
  The admission of the Baltic states in the Western European 
Union [WEU] as associated members is a clear sign that the 
European Union considers them its future members, Luik told the 
news conference. He stressed that the decision had been made at 
the initiative of the French and German foreign ministers, 
although the associate membership agreements are to be concluded 
in the autumn only. The foreign minister added that the WEU is 
an increasingly defence-oriented organisation, whose membership 
will increase the security of the Baltic states. 
  Most European states demand the withdrawal of the Russian 
forces by 31 August Luik went on. He stressed that support to 
the claim had been expressed by Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski and the representatives of the Council of Europe 
Committee of Ministers at the Strasbourg session of the 
committee. 
  The Polish foreign minister also recommended that the Baltic 
leaders should take advantage of President Clinton's visit to 
Poland in July and meet the U.S. President. 
  Luik also mentioned the hope of Russian Ambassador Aleksandr 
Trofimov that Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will 
attend the meeting of the Baltic Sea countries' foreign 
ministers meeting in Tallinn on 24-25 May.

  [Text] Further defence projects with Israel are possible, 
Defence Minister Indrek Kannik announced in a telephone 
interview during his visit to Israel. 
  Kannik announced that the Israeli company "El-Bit" has 
expressed its interest in participating the contest for 
suppliers of radar and surveillance systems for the border 
guard. The Israel Aircraft Industries had mentioned possible 
supply of aircraft, but Kannik stressed that both military and 
financial aspects of the issue must be considered, due to 
Estonia's limited resources. 
  The company TAAS Israel Industries had expressed its 
interest 
in the privatisation of the Estonian electronics factory Tarkom 
in order to organise the production of telephones there. Kannik 
also hoped that an agreement could be made, enabling to replace 
the unusable weapons by fit ones. The Estonian General 
Headquarters will have to present a list of equipment that needs 
to be replaced, Kannik said. 
  Kannik met Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on Friday 
[13 
May] and discussed mostly general political issues, including 
the Estonian-Russian negotiations.

  [Text] Estonia does not intend to purchase significant 
amount of weaponry in the near future. This was stated by 
Estonian Foreign Minister Indrek Kannik [title as received] at 
the airport today after his return from Israel. 
  During a week-long trip he had also visited Luxembourg and 
France. 
  Kannik announced that Estonia needed electronic systems for 
surveillance over its marine and land borders in order to ensure 
its security. This issue was discussed during his visit to 
Israel on the invitation of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. 
  France, Italy, and Sweden have also proposed that Estonia 
purchase their radio radar equipment. 
  Kannik said a special working commission would make the 
final 
decision on the issue. However, the seller state will have to 
allot the appropriate credit to Estonia since its budget 
situation provided for no direct deal. 
  Kannik stressed that in any case this would not be such a 
big 
contract as that of the last year concluded with the Taas 
Israeli company, which had sold to Estonia weaponry costing a 
total $49 million. 
  Kannik repeated that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania had been 
given associated partner status in the Western European Union at 
the meeting of the defense and foreign ministers of this 
organization in Luxembourg. Kannik emphasized that on this 
issue the Western European Union made no difference between the 
Baltic states and Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and 
Slovakia. 
  Speaking on his visit to France, Kannik pointed to the 
agreement on cooperation between the French and Estonian defense 
ministers signed in Paris.

  [Excerpts] Tonu Kaljumae will now report about the Baltic 
Assembly's sitting, which has ended in Jurmala. 
  [Begin Kaljumae recording] Today the fourth session of the 
Baltic Assembly ended in Jurmala. A whole string of documents 
were prepared in the course of three days and today Estonian, 
Latvian, and Lithuanian representatives signed them. Ulo Nugis, 
the Estonian delegation's leader, which of the adopted documents 
-- and there are about a dozen of them -- is the most important 
in your view? 
  [Nugis] I would not underestimate any of them, but it seems 
to me personally that the most important documents are to do 
with the topical political issues, in particular relations with 
Russia and the Russian troop withdrawal. I would rate the 
Baltic Assembly's statement as number one, on the Russian 
Federation's statements of pressure on the Baltic states. In 
essence, let us say, it amounts to support from two Baltic 
countries -- Latvia and Lithuania -- to Estonia. Its preamble 
states clearly that the Russian defense minister has threatened 
Estonia with additional troops, and the Baltic Assembly states 
that, both at present and in the future, threats or exertions of 
pressure to any one Baltic state, whichever form they take, will 
be viewed as a threat to the security of all three Baltic 
states. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] A World Bank (WB) delegation has arrived in Tallinn 
for talks to discuss the terms of a 20-million-U.S.-dollar aid 
package to Estonia. 
  The visit is the fourth and probably the last one of its 
kind 
before a final decision on the loan is taken, WB representative 
in Tallinn Hillar Lauri told INTERFAX. The money to be allocated 
to the Estonian Government is to be later distributed among 
commercial banks. 
  The agreement on the 15-year loan at an annual 7.43 percent 
rate is to be ratified by the State Assembly, Estonian 
parliament. 
  The fund is intended to help local banks build up their 
basic 
assets and provide long-term credits to enterprises. 
  Lauri stressed that an increase in basic assets of the 
commercial banks will enable them to grant long-term credits to 
local plants and by definition, speed up economic stabilization. 
  At this point the country has 22 commercial banks. A minimal 
ceiling of 15 million Eesti Kroones (8 Kroones equal DM [German 
marks 1]) has been set up to help create new banks. This is to 
be increased by 10 million Kroones annually in the next two 
years. As a long-range prospect, the minimal ceiling is to be 
raised to 75 million Kroones which is a minimum that the 
European Union set up for private banks. 
  Earlier, Estonia borrowed $30 million from the World Bank to 
help reorganize its economy.

  [Text] Tallinn, 13 May, BNS -- The balance sheet of the 
North Estonian Bank for April shows that the volume of deposits 
grew in one month from 452.5 million to 560.8 million kroons or 
by more than 100 million kroons. 
  Most of the money was placed in demand deposits. The bank 
completed in March and April sanitization of its loan portfolio 
and weeded out all bad loans. The loan portfolio grew last 
month by almost 8 percent amounting to 307.4 million kroons. 
  The account of the North Estonian Bank in the Bank of 
Estonia 
contained over 150 million kroons most of which was used for 
extending overnight loans. The bank extended in April a total 
of nearly 700 million kroons in loans to other banks, which made 
it one of Estonia's major lenders. 
  The bank's solvency last month was 9.32 percent, liquidity 
58.11 percent, and risk concentration 423 percent. 
  The balance volume of the North Estonian Bank amounted to 
950.63 million kroons, which placed it among the top five 
Estonian banks. Its capital stock stands at 43 million kroons.

  [Text] Vilnius, 13 May, BNS -- Lithuanian Prime Minister 
Adolfas Slezevicius on Thursday [12 May] named five candidates 
for ministers of economics, forestry, environment protection, 
culture, and education. 
  The candidacies were reportedly submitted to President 
Algirdas Brazauskas for consideration. 
  The premier proposed the social and economic policy adviser 
to the president, Aleksandras Vasiliauskas, to fill the vacant 
post of economics minister, and nominated the director of the 
Dubrava Forestry Research Institute, Albertas Vasiliauskas, for 
the post of forestry minister. 
  Three other nominations are related to the law on 
government, 
which is likely to be adopted next week. The government law 
provides for 18 ministries instead of the present 16. 
  Slezevicius proposed the deputy director general of the 
Environment Protection Department, Bronius Bradauskas, to head 
the new Environment Protection Ministry. 
  According to the law on government, the Ministry of 
Education 
and Culture would be divided into two separate ministries. 
Dainius Trinkunas, who now heads the ministry, announced his 
intention to resign. The director general of the Vilnius 
Philharmonic, Gintautas Kevisas, was nominated for minister of 
culture. The post of education minister has been offered to the 
head of the Pedagogics and Psychology Department of the Kaunas 
Physical Culture Institute, Kestutis Miskinis.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] An aide of the Russian president, Georgy Satarov, 
has granted an exclusive interview to Vyacheslav Terekhov of 
Interfax [IF]. 
  IF: Does it not seem to you that the abundance of 
organizations signing the Pact on National Accord as well as the 
nature of some of them (athletic, children's) diminish the 
political weight of the document? 
  SATAROV: I do not think so. One of the purposes of the pact 
was to promote the strengthening of a civic society through 
involving public institutions in the conciliatory mechanisms 
provided for by the document. Through these mechanisms public 
organizations can discuss their problems and work out 
recommendations which allows them to influence the government 
increasing the status, the weight of these organizations. Taken 
together they form institutions of a civic society confidence in 
which is a necessary element of democracy. 
  IF: In other words: the more, the better. Do you think the 
number of signatories makes the accord stronger? 
  SATAROV: Yes, because the nearest task is to invite all 
these organizations to round-table meetings to resolve concrete 
matters. These round-tables should not be formed only of 
government representatives. 
  IF: Can you sum up any results of signing the pact? 
  SATAROV: It is too early to speak of results. I would 
compare that to asking about the results of family life after 
wedding. The main thing is that people live together, have 
children and raise them. Still no one is cancelling the wedding 
ritual, and the attitude to it is more or less serious. In this 
case we can speak of a similar ritual. 
  It is not over, of course, as there is a big group willing 
to 
join the pact: associations of workers of culture, science and 
the media as well as major manufacturing amalgamations and 
employers, a big number of parties and organizing committees of 
parties. The process of signing will not be closed after they 
join, though it will evidently become less pompous. Still if 
new parties appear and wish to join the pact in, say, six 
months, they will be given the chance to do that. 
  IF: The irreconcilable opposition has recovered from its 
shock last October and made a number of harsh verbal attacks on 
the regime. Do you think that these attacks launched by 
judicial bodies is an attempt of the authorities to remind their 
opponents that if they continue their radical line, they are 
going to land in prison again? 
  SATAROV: No. In this case there is only one consideration: 
the need to observe acting legislation. 
  IF Note: The office of the Moscow Prosecutor has started 
checking the unlawful actions that took place during an 
opposition rally in Lubyanskaya Ploshchad in Moscow on May 9. 
Investigators are studying video-tapes of the rally and 
procession. The former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, the 
leader of Working Russia Viktor Anpilov, the head of the 
National Salvation Front Ilya Konstantinov and others have been 
invited to the office to offer explanations. IF: The law 
prohibits calls for overthrowing the regime by force. However, 
when Aleksandr Rutskoy spoke of celebrating the 50th anniversary 
of V-E Day under a different regime, he did not mention armed 
struggle. 
  SATAROV: There were also other speeches. For example, calls 
were made to the army, the security forces and so on. I would 
want to remind you that immediately after the amnesty on 
February 23 the chairman of the Duma Ivan Rybkin made a 
statement imposing certain obligations on the amnestied. It did 
not mean the restriction of political activities as such, but 
they should be within the framework of law. 
  IF: You mean that calls for changing the system or president 
are part of normal political life? 
  SATAROV: Yes. They were made earlier too. 
  IF: Let us imagine an impossible situation that someone of 
the "irreconcilables" wishes to join the pact. What will the 
presidential team do? SATAROV: The question is within the 
competence of the conciliatory commission of the pact that is to 
be set up in the nearest future. 
  IF: In other words will they be able to sign the document, 
if they wish? 
  SATAROV: Theoretically speaking, yes. Why not?

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report: "May Demonstrations by </F>
Intransigent Opposition Have Shaken Authorities"] 
  [Text] The so-called "working people's May 
demonstrations," which ended with the burning of a Russian flag 
and calls by A. Rutskoy and his associates to overthrow the 
present "police" regime before the 50th anniversary of Victory 
Day, have not passed unnoticed in the Kremlin. V. Shumeyko, 
speaker of the upper chamber of parliament, came to see 
President B. Yeltsin about this incident 17 May, and he was 
closely followed by Premier V. Chernomyrdin. 
  V. Shumeyko told your IZVESTIYA correspondent that during 
their discussion about the problem of ensuring stability in 
society, opinion had been unanimous: Any actions by 
intransigent elements that violate Russian Federation laws and 
the Russian Federation Constitution must be stopped. For 
example, with regard to the burning of the national flag: Video 
footage showed specific individuals, and the Prosecutor's Office 
should initiate criminal proceedings immediately. The same 
applies to A. Rutskoy's appeals. Extremely gross violations of 
the Constitution and Russian laws are plainly evident, and these 
cannot be allowed to occur without some sort of reaction from 
the authorities. 
  Of course, the problem of meeting the commitments agreed 
under the Treaty of Accord was also discussed, V. Shumeyko said. 
At issue are the principles of establishing an observer 
commission to implement this document. Unless both chambers of 
parliament take part in forming the commission, the operation 
will be impossible. It is most likely that the commission will 
include representatives of the most influential and largest 
political forces. The commission chairman, I think, should be a 
politically neutral person who is prepared to accept proposals 
from any political group. Academician Topornin figures in this 
list, but I would not like to deflect him from his business in 
the Public Chamber, V. Shumeyko stressed.

  [Text] Moscow May 22 TASS -- Speaker of the Federation 
Council Vladimir Shumeyko believes the resignation of Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin "is extremely undesirable in the 
current situation". 
  He told reporters on Wednesday that "Russia was lucky that 
Chernomyrdin became the head of government". 
  On Tuesday leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord 
Sergey Shakhray predicted that Chernomyrdin may resign in August 
if urgent measures are not taken to improve the economic 
situation. 
  But Shumeyko doubts that Chernomyrdin would resign. He 
characterised him as "a fighter". 
  Despite his serious contradictions with Economics Minister 
Aleksandr Shokhin, Shumeyko believes that the latter should 
remain in the government. "Such a highly-skilled professional as 
Aleksandr Shokhin should work in the government", he said. 
  The speaker also welcomed the appointment to the government 
of Nikolay Travkin who used to work as a head of a district in 
the Moscow region. "It is necessary to gather the experience of 
every Russian region", he commented. 
  Shumeyko believes that the dismissal of Shakhray as the 
nationalities minister would hardly trigger new conflicts in 
Russia. "The number of interethnic conflicts will not change 
after Sergey Shakhray left the government", he said. 
  The speaker also played down fears caused by Shakhray's 
predictions that a new stand-off of authorities, worse than the 
one which took place last October, is in store for Russia in 
August. He said such forecasts have been made each spring and 
autumn. "A normal way out can be found from even the most 
difficult situation", he stressed. 
  Shumeyko does not believe it necessary to introduce a state 
of economoic emergency in the country, but called to pay more 
attention to the military-industrial and the agricultural 
complexes which suffer a lot in the course of reforms. 
  Speaking on his relations with the president, Shumeyko 
stressed that he "supported and would support Boris Yeltsin as a 
reformer".

  [Text] The former vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy was 
summoned to the office of the Moscow Prosecutor on Thursday. 
This was reported to Interfax by a member of the Duma and the 
leader of the People's Party of Free Russia Vasiliy Lipitskiy. 
  The office of the Prosecutor General has given instructions 
to the Moscow Prosecutor to check the lawfulness of a number of 
statements and calls by opposition leaders during mass actions 
on May 9 in Moscow, including calls to destroy the current 
regime, and to evaluate the burning of the Russian flag in 
public. 
  Other summons have been sent to the leader of Working Russia 
Victor Anpilov, the head of the National Salvation Front Ilya 
Konstantinov who together with Rutskoy were released from jail 
last February under an amnesty of the Duma.

  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- One of two blasts ripped the 
air in downtown Moscow where a joint stock society of the closed 
type was located. 
  ITAR-TASS learnt at the Moscow Chief Militia Department that 
an explosive device without a shell went off due to careless 
handling. The society's driver brought it to the office due to 
some reasons. 
  He received several lacerated wounds, and both his hands 
were 
torn away. He soon died from the loss of blood. Militia found 
two cartridges, two electric detonators and two radio 
transmitters at the place of accident. The blast was so 
powerful that the society's door was blown out, and all glass 
was shattered at the house entrance foyer. 
  The second explosion sounded in Moscow's suburb (2, 
Varshavskoye highway). An explosive device was planted into a 
Lada car which belonged to the managing director of the 
Grigori-91 firm. Luckily, there were no casualties. Only the 
Lada car and nearby Zaporozhets car were damaged. Windows were 
shattered at a house. 
  Investigation was started in both cases.

  [Text] Moscow May 18 -- Russian civil aviation pilots went 
on general strike at 9:00 A.M. Moscow time today. The personnel 
of over 90 per cent of civil aviation enterprises from all over 
Russia, beginning from Kaliningrad in the extreme west of Russia 
to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in the Far East, have confirmed their 
intention to participate in the strike, ITAR-TASS learned from 
the strike headquarters. 
  The protest action began on Tuesday when Moscow pilots 
staged 
pickets outside the building of the State Duma. The strikers 
hope to make the government meet their demands which were 
formulated in a package of documents which had been submitted to 
the government for consideration in February. 
  President of the trade union of Russian Pilots, Alfred 
Malinovsky, told ITAR-TASS that they suggest lifting unjustified 
tariffs for transportation imposed on civil aviation and 
introducing an efficient system of non-cash payments. He 
pointed out that it is important to create an employment fund 
for the aviation personnel to promote that experienced pilots 
remain on staff of civil aviation enterprises, at present, 
around 7,000-8,000 experienced pilots aged from 27 to 37 are 
facing redundancies, Malinovsky said. 
  Among other demands pilots propose to introduce a new 
aviation code to meet international rules, ensure the safety of 
flights, normal pensions for pilots and their social insurance. 
  "All these problems are quite solvable and part of them 
might 
be resolved within a few months. However, the problem of 
pensions should be settled until May 18. Since it requires no 
particular modifications in the legislature or additional funds. 
But despite all our efforts, the authorities declined to open a 
dialogue with us to discuss our demands," Malinovsky said. 
  Pilots engaged in sanitary aviation, air search teams and 
some other kinds of civil aviation are not taking part in the 
strike.

  [Text] Moscow, 18 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Not all flight crews 
are supporting the nationwide strike called for today by the 
Russian pilots' union. Services are continuing on many routes, 
above all those operated out of the capital's airports. 
  Nevertheless, as the public relations department of the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Transport told ITAR-TASS, 
departures have been cancelled or delayed in a number of cities. 
In Ufa, for instance, nine flights were cancelled, and two in 
St. Petersburg. 
  Meanwhile, the office of Russia's procurator-general has 
filed suit against the pilots' union, calling for the strike to 
be declared illegal. The case will be heard today.

  [Text] Chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
(FSK) Sergey Stepashin in an interview with Interfax on Tuesday 
said he was opposed to the imposition of federal rule in North 
Ossetia's Prigorodny Region, which is at the center of a dispute 
between the Ossetian and Ingush communities. He described 
special rule as a form of territorial claim. 
  Stepashin said the misguided article six of the law 
rehabilitating the deported people which provides for territory 
changes had ignited the whole of the Northern Caucausus. While 
the introduction of special rule in Prigorodny Region could blow 
up the whole of Russia, he said. "We have already gone through 
this in Nagorno-Karabakh," he added. 
  The FSK chief believes the parliament must ban any attempt 
to 
redraw borders and prevent all announcing of territorial claims. 
  Pointing to what he called Chechnya's "visible and 
invisible" 
presence in any region of the Northern Caucausus, Stepashin said 
that Chechen leader Johar Dudayev stood to benefit from the 
conflict between Ossetia and Ingushetia whether maintaining the 
role of a potential peacemaker or directly involving itself in 
the conflict. 
  Stepashin said his agency was capable of improving the 
situation in Chechnya itself by ensuring the safety of railway 
trains which come under attack there. One way of resolving the 
problem is to replace ordinary trains for armored ones 
accompanied by military escorts, he said. 
  Stepashin said that different states including Turkey and 
the 
U.S. had begun to consider the region as an area of their vital 
interests over the years of regional instability. "Their 
intelligence services employ military and trade emissaries, 
professional agents and foreign nationals to carry out espionage 
in the region," he said. "The FSK is planning a series of 
operations to try to root out these practices," Stepashin said. 
He stressed that FSK activity in the Northern Caucausus would 
become part of government policies given the crisis situation 
there.

  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- The amount of annual payments 
made by Russia for servicing its external debt exceeds that paid 
by the former Soviet Union to its foreign creditors. The 
Russian Government has had to stop the issue of state guarantees 
to the Western creditors who fund joint projects in Russia, Vice 
Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, who is also economics minister, 
announced at a press conference today. 
  The vice premier stressed that enterprises wishing to obtain 
centralised credits, including from the package of Western 
financial assistance to Russian market reforms will from now on 
have to decide what property -- land, buildings or securities -- 
they can mortgage in case their project turns out to be 
loss-making. 
  As concerns the insolvent debtors, under whose obligations 
the Russian Government now has to pay in accordance with the 
country's foreign commitments, the Cabinet of Ministers is now 
working on a scheme of making them pay federal authorities, 
including through the court of arbitration, Shokhin said.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1800 GMT on 17 May carries a three-minute report on a news 
conference given by Russian Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin. 
  The correspondent says that Russia has declined an 
invitation 
to take part in a meeting of the Paris Club of the country's 
creditors on 2-3 June. The correspondent reports that at a news 
conference on 17 May, Shokhin said that he considered the recent 
granting of credit by the IMF as sufficient reason for 
concluding a new agreement with the Paris Club. In a recording, 
Shokhin says that two weeks would not be sufficient time to work 
out repayment proposals based on Russia's budget. 
  Shokhin says: "It is necessary to hold preliminary 
consultations with the members of the Paris Club so that the 
meeting, itself, should produce results. We do not yet have the 
basic concept for restructuring the 1994 payments and we are 
simply physically unable to draw up this concept by 2-3 June. 
And for this reason we have asked for the meeting to be held in 
mid-June." 
  Shokhin concludes by saying that the important thing is for 
a 
realistic repayment figure to be reached.

<F P=106> [Report by Yelena Chepkasova and Ivan Zasurskiy in the </F>
"Presentation" column: "Boris Fedorov Proposes Making the Bank 
of Russia A Locomotive Of Reform. The Central Bank Does Not 
Care for the Monetarist Bill"] 
  [Text] Yesterday an enlarged session of the Central Bank's 
subcommittee on money and credit policy discussed a draft law 
presented by Boris Fedorov: On the Central Bank of the Russian 
Federation. The session was attended by ex-Finance Minister 
Boris Fedorov, now chairman of the [State Duma] subcommittee on 
the Central Bank; Aleksandr Khandruyev, deputy chairman of the 
Central Bank; and representatives of commercial banks and the 
Moscow Interregional Currency Exchange. 
  Although the discussion of the draft law was not in the 
confrontational spirit of old, it was interrupted by some rather 
sharp interventions by representatives of the legislative and 
monetary "power branches." 
  At the session, the draft law on the Central Bank was 
disseminated, whose basic provisions are contained in Articles 
19, 20, 75, 79, and 122. 
  In particular Article 19 resurrects the Central Bank from 
the 
ashes of former battles as a powerful phoenix: "Legislative and 
executive bodies may not interfere in the activity of the Bank 
of Russia in exercising its powers enshrined in laws or make 
decisions which hinder the Bank of Russia's activity. In the 
event of an intervention attempt, the Bank of Russia shall 
ignore the illegal injunctions and advise the State Duma." 
  Boris Fedorov's draft provides only for "a week-long freeze" 
on Central Bank decisions on matters pertaining to its powers, 
and this prerogative is concentrated in the hands of the finance 
minister who may (Article 20) suspend Central Bank decisions for 
this period of time. 
  Viewed from the angle of political practice, these decisions 
show that Boris Fedorov has not lost the hope of becoming head 
of an independent Central Bank, while for the Finance Ministry 
loss of power is to be offset by the possibility of deriving a 
profit from collaboration with commercial structures. 
Incidentally, Fedorov sees the president's position as a source 
for his hopes to get "Gerashchenko's scalp": Article 122 
proposes a new procedure for appointing and dismissing the 
Central Bank chief. As of now the Russian president will have 
an overriding power (while the State Duma will be able to make 
such decisions in a limited enumeration of cases) 
  Articles 75 and 79 of the draft are of major importance. 
Thus, Article 75 empowers the Central Bank to license all 
currency operations by "banks and other credit institutions," 
including the import and export of capital. Article 79 strips 
commercial banks of the right to commercial secrets (insurance 
companies, investment funds and companies, in full; and 
brokerage firms, their associations, and regulating bodies, 
partially) if the Central Bank demands relevant data from them. 
The same article, however, obligates the Central Bank not to 
pass on such information to anybody else. 
  On the whole, the draft law proposes that the Central Bank 
be 
used as a locomotive of monetarist economic reform, with 
Fedorov's Central Bank model being closest to Latvia's. There 
they have a president of the Bank of Latvia, Eynars Repshe; the 
lat stands at $1.50; and industry is winding up the production 
of RAF minivans.

  [Text] Vladivostok May 18 TASS -- An investigation into the 
explosion at aviation ammunition depots of the Pacific Fleet 
showed that the explosion was caused by outrageous negligence 
and lax discipline of the guards. 
  The explosion occurred 100 kilometers off Vladivostok at 
16:00 local time. A fire broke out which caused other 
explosions with unexploded shells scattered within the range of 
over 10 kilometers. The fire reduced to rubble 200 out of 800 
wagons with ammunition, a service room for the guards, 
soldiers' barracks and other constructions and partially damaged 
the railway. It was only on Sunday that the fire was 
extinguished. Luckily, there were no casualties among the 
guards and the personnel of the ammunition depot. 
  According to preliminary estimates made by experts, civilian 
constructions in nearby settlements of Novonezhino and Romanovka 
were out of reach of fragments of shells scattered by the 
explosion. Later, numerous damages of buildings and economic 
facilities were detected. Over 2,000 people were evacuated from 
the villages of Novonezhino, Romanovka, Smolyaninovo. A total 
of 22 civilians who were injured by broken glass smashed out by 
the explosion applied for medical aid. 
  Conter-intelligence officers of the Pacific Fleet 
established 
that one of the soldiers on guard, after his shift was over, 
found an electric igniter of a gun-powder rocket accelerator and 
began to disassemble it with a knife. The knife set the 
gun-powder accelerator on fire and the soldier threw it into the 
bushes, setting dry grass on fire. Rocket shells piled up 
nearby caught fire and several minutes later an explosion 
occurred. 
  The soldier and his teammate who was nearby escaped from the 
scene of the explosion without notifying the command about the 
accident. 
  The military prosecutor's office of the garrison has 
instituted criminal proceedings. An investigation into the 
explosion continues.

  [Text] Last evening a man was arrested as a suspect in the 
explosion of the Pacific Fleet Air Force ammunition dump. The 
suspect is a member of the garrison who was acting for mercenary 
motives; this according to an ITAR-TASS correspondent who 
received this information from a source in the Pacific Fleet. 
  According to another version filed by ITAR-TASS, the 
explosion was caused by the carelessness of those guarding the 
dump.

  [Text] Vladivostok May 18 -- The Pacific Fleet ammunition 
storage facility exploded on May 14 because of irresponsibility 
and negligence in guarding the facility, the local 
counterintelligence service reported, denying earlier rumours 
about an alleged act of subversion and the arrest of a suspect 
whose actions were motivated by pecuniary interests, and search 
for an accomplice. 
  According to Pacific Fleet counter-intelligence sources, a 
guard off duty found a discarded electric device, part of a 
rocket acceleration unit which incorporates a gunpowder charge, 
left unattended on the premises. He took the thing up an began 
to dismantle it with the help of a penknife, with another guard 
off duty watching him do it. The knight slipped and struck the 
charge which ignited on impact. The first guard hurled the 
burning unit aside where last year grass caught the fire at 
once, setting aflame a stack of jet shells. 
  The frightened soldiers fled from the scene without doing 
anything to extinguish the fire or notifying the unit commander 
of the incident. The first explosion followed within minutes. 
  The military prosecutor of the garrison has instituted 
criminal proceedings and the investigation continues.

<F P=106> [Natalya Ostrovskaya report: "Bombs Exploding in the </F>
Maritime Kray Again. But the Explosions Two Years Ago Have 
Still Not Been Investigated"] 
  [Text] Vladivostok -- The Maritime Kray marked the second 
anniversary of the notorious explosions at the Pacific Fleet 
arsenal in Vladivostok (14 May 1992) with a far more powerful 
"salute" at the Pacific Fleet air forces central air weapons 
dump, which is 100 km from the city, near the settlement of 
Novonezhino. 
  On precisely 14 May, at approximately 1500 hours local time, 
there were reports from the dump that a fire had started, that 
the guard was unable to handle it alone. Some minutes later 
there were explosions -- a first, followed by a second.... 
According to witnesses, and there were plenty of them, since an 
electric train from Vladivostok was pulling in to Novonezhino, 
the third explosion was the biggest. According to Maritime Kray 
governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, appearing on local television the 
next day, the explosion at the Pacific Fleet dump was equivalent 
to that of an atom bomb. At any rate, Vladivostok was rocked, 
as if a small earthquake had occurred: Windows shook and the 
inhabitants of housing developments in Tikhaya Bay and Russkiy 
island felt their floors vibrate. 
  It made a big impression on 66 children from Tokyo on 
holiday 
at the "Okean" children's camp. It is on the opposite shore of 
Ussuriyskiy Bay from where the incident occurred. The shock 
wave from the explosion blew out all the windows in the central 
complex, where the young Japanese were at the time. But the 
guests kept their heads, spilled out onto the street, and 
organized... a disco. 
  The inhabitants of Novonezhino and other settlements within 
a 
radius of six-eight km from the exploding dump -- Anisimovka, 
Romanovka, Smolyaninovo, and nearby garrisons and way stations 
-- were clearly not in a dancing mood. Some 2,000 people from 
Novonezhino, mainly women and children from officers' families, 
were evacuated by electric train during the explosions, as 
chunks and fragments of metal whistled by over distances of 
kilometers. Every minute counted, since the track, embankment, 
and contact rails were soon broken or wrecked. 
  What can you say about the "theater of combat actions," 
when, 
according to information confirmed by the kray civil defense 
staff, several very long-range projectiles flew from the site of 
the explosion as far as the city of Bolshoy Kamen -- home, as is 
known, of the "Zvezda" defense plant, which now specializes in 
dismantling submarines with nuclear reactors. 
  As on 14 May, a black day for the Maritime Kray, so today, 
when these lines are being written, there is no information on 
the victims of the tragedy. There is every reason to believe 
that the future holds the key, as in the case of the affair of 
two years ago. For instance, the latest victim of the previous 
explosions at the Pacific Fleet arsenal was a Vladivostok boy 
who found a shell two weeks ago. And his was by no means the 
only death. The casualty radius of accidental explosions in the 
Pacific Fleet's undeclared war on its own territory against 
itself and its own civilian population is great not so much in 
spatial terms as in terms of time. 
  We have been told that no one in the military or in the 
civilian population was particularly badly affected. There are, 
though, instances of trivial injuries: Cuts and lacerations and 
bruises -- no more than that. On Sunday 15 May, thank goodness, 
the rain came right on time, the fire was doused, and, as the 
kray leadership reported on the radio, the danger of further 
explosions passed and it was decided to people should return to 
their homes. Arond 3,000 people had been evacuated in all. 
  It was also announced that the Pacific Fleet air forces 
central air weapons dump contained only weapons with powder 
charges (around 5,000 aerial bombs, guided and unguided 
missiles, 800 truckloads of pyrotechnics, and an amount of TNT 
in the dump stores equivalent to two nuclear warheads). It was 
stated that there were no chemical, bacteriological, or nuclear 
weapons there. 
  But there is no dump any more following the disaster. The 
extent of the devastation is such that the facility cannot be 
resurrected. As it happens, it also contained ammunition made 
in 1937, long out of date. What the military had failed to do 
on schedule has been achieved by accident. 
  As for the reasons for the fire at the central dump, so far 
silence. The investigation of the incident is in the hands of 
the Maritime Kray Administration of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service. But we already know the two main 
versions of the incident. The first comes from a Pacific Fleet 
spokesman, and what it boils down to is the traditional spring 
taiga fires. Apparently, there was a gale on 14 May, which 
spread the fire to the territory of the protected facility. 
  This version is totally rejected by governor Nazdratenko. 
According to his information, fire originally broke out not on 
the outskirts, but in the center of the dump. It was there that 
the first explosion occurred. Perhaps someone wanted it to 
happen? Incidentally, local people have their own "domestic" 
version concerning a unit commander arrested recently for 
trading in weapons. So now the tracks had to be covered.... 
Incidentally, the latest major theft of weapons from Pacific 
Fleet dumps took place actually in the vicinity of Novonezhino. 
  What the competent bodies are going to say about the tragedy 
and whether they will say anything at all is the big question. 
The experience of the investigation of the explosions that 
occurred the year before last at the Pacific Fleet arsenal in 
Vladivostok suggests that it is not just a unit commander who is 
covering tracks. In fact, no one has yet been properly called 
to account for the sudden combat actions on the streets of 
Vladivostok on 14 May 1992; the investigation into the incident 
is still not complete.

<F P=106> [Sergey Avdeyev report: "Terrible Mushroom Grows in </F>
Maritime Kray Taiga"] 
  [Text] The devil is evidently laying his hands on military 
arsenals: Ammunition dumps of the Red-Banner Pacific Fleet have 
blown up once again. The memorable Vladivostok explosion of two 
years ago now looks like child's play -- on Saturday 14 May the 
major arsenal of the fleet's air force thundered forth in 
Maritime Kray. This was the equivalent of the blast from a 
five-kilotonne atom bomb. 
  The mushroom that grew near the village of Novonezhino was 
very similar to the familiar silhouette in textbooks on nuclear 
security -- the height of a substantial hill, black and crimson, 
it terrified the local inhabitants. It was a sunny day, and 
people were digging in truck gardens. The shock wave bowled 
them all over. They got up and ran to the houses. A second, 
mightier blast caught them 40 seconds later. After the third 
one they could enter the houses from any side: They had neither 
windows nor doors, indeed some people had no walls left either. 
  Panic set in. For some reason mothers began pushing their 
children under the beds. Grandmothers shouted "It's war!" and 
started praying. Cats went crazy, dogs howled. A sickening, 
acrid smell of burning hung in the air.... 
  There were not, however, any nuclear or chemical charges in 
this arsenal. Aerial bombs, missiles, and shells, brought here 
from the Baltic region, were exploding. The dumps were very 
well guarded, and the military took pride in them. The arsenal 
was also located well from the safety viewpoint: The villages 
were quite a long way off and were protected by hills. This 
saved the inhabitants. So far there has not been a single 
casualty. The fire was extinguished by the next morning. 
Sappers, militia, and counterintelligence officers are working 
there now. 
<H5>  From KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA's File </H5>
  Free-flight rocket -- based on tanks, aircraft, and ships. 
Range -- 10-15 km. Explodes on impact by self-detonation. 
  Antitank guided missile -- based on aircraft, ships, and 
infantry fighting vehicles. Equipped with self-destruct device. 
Self-detonated, could hit chance target, i.e. function in line 
with combat launch. Range -- 20-25 km. 
  The evacuation of people was organized professionally. The 
military, the authorities, and the militia secured a lot of 
buses amazingly promptly and evacuated five villages: 
Smolyaninovo, Romanovka, Novonezhino, and two small 
farmstead-railroad halts. All the locals had long known from the 
military that if THAT blew up, everything would be destroyed for 
30 km around. So they evacuated people beyond the 30km zone -- 
to Shkotovo and Bolshoy Kamen. 
  Fortunately it was not the entire arsenal that blew up. But 
even what did was enough to cause a minor earthquake. Windows 
were broken even in buildings in Vladivostok and in blocks at 
the "Okean" children's camp, which are a good 50 km away as the 
crow flies. There is scarcely a single building in the villages 
that did not suffer. 
  A Vladivostok-Partizansk electric train was approaching the 
"Kilometer 53" halt at the moment of the first explosion. When 
the engineer caught sight of the mushroom from the explosion, he 
stopped braking and took the train through the falling debris to 
the next station. A couple of minutes later the railroad was at 
a standstill -- the contact wires had been broken, and debris 
and blocks were falling right onto the permanent way. 
  "Not many people in the village were injured," Divisional 
Militia Captain Viktor Bityuk said. "Some were hit by bricks 
from a falling chimney, some were cut by broken glass, and some 
did not open their mouths or put their hands over their ears in 
time and now cannot hear." 
  On that day Viktor himself had only just finished his shift 
and was getting ready for bed. Now it is 48 hours since he 
slept. He was leading people out of their yards, and they were 
stopping vehicles on the road until the buses arrived.... 
  "Imagine, there was not a single instance of a private 
driver's refusing to take people in his vehicle further away 
from the blast," he said in surprise. "On the contrary, there 
were volunteers who offered their help and first-aid kits. They 
released the sailors locked up in the garrison guardhouse and 
made them help me. I set them to guarding stores and the 
savings bank. Believe me, there was not a single robbery!" 
  Just one case of looting has been recorded so far. Fish 
protection inspector Vladimir Snurnik was leading people from a 
danger zone by the river while his own village of Romanovka was 
being evacuated. He found himself nearby and called at his 
home. Everything there had been turned upside down, and the safe 
had been opened. They had evidently been looking for his 
pistol, which he had with him at the time. 
  Weapons, incidentally, have always drawn thieves and bandits 
of various kinds to the arsenal. The small arms of all the 
nearby military units were kept there. Last year a major 
robbery occurred, for which a unit commander and six of his 
accomplices were arrested. The investigation also links the 
present disaster to the problem of weapons thefts. 
  Almost everyone is certain that this was no chance ignition. 
There are eyewitnesses who say that the first fire broke out 
right in the middle of one of the dumps. Rockets at once flew 
in various directions and started a fire right around the 
perimeter of the huge arsenal. 
  Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy commander in chief of 
the Navy, who has arrived in Maritime Kray with a group of 
experts, is still very cautious in his assessments of the cause 
of what happened. He has said just one thing unequivocally: 
The destruction is colossal, such as I have never seen before 
in my life. 
  ...A friend and I were once collecting ferns in these 
places. 
There were so many of them on the slopes of the hills that we 
could pick them without straightening up. These hills that are 
turning green are now strewn equally thickly with unexploded 
shells and debris. I walked with Anatoliy Panteleyevich 
Shevchenko, head of Smolyaninovo Administration, through the 
streets of the deserted settlement. There was still 
intermittent rumbling, and he showed me which hill had taken the 
most terrible blow and which one had saved 100-year-old 
Romanovka, which has lived through two wars and now, so it turns 
out, also a third one. 
  "Where can I find that much window glass now?" the head 
grieved, looking at the gaping windows. 
  Yes, we will all need a lot more window glass. This Pacific 
Fleet arsenal is not the last one....

<F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F>
Ministry] 
  [Text] A difficult situation has arisen among Russian 
nuclear workers. This was confirmed by last week's explosion in 
Snezhinsk nuclear center in the Urals [on 13 May] that injured 
two of the center's workers. In the opinion of the center's 
leadership, the incident was caused by the unstable 
psychological state of the creators of Russia's nuclear weapons. 
This is occurring because of the extremely tense situation that 
has arisen in the sector. 
  The state's debts to the Urals' nuclear workers are now 
approaching 30 billion rubles. This has virtually caused 
nuclear research to come to a halt. The leaders of the federal 
nuclear center have again called on the country's government to 
change their attitude to the nuclear complex.

  [Text] Talking to the Black Sea Fleet's veterans in Moscow, 
the First Deputy Commander of the Russian Navy Admiral Igor 
Kasatonov said the Russians were the predominant force in Crimea 
and the Black Sea Fleet had been and would remain Russian. The 
Black Sea Fleet was an integral fighting unit of the Russian 
Navy, Kasatonov said. 
  According to Kasatonov, the most difficult stage in the 
efforts to decide the Fleet's fate was over. Negotiations were 
underway, he said, and moves were being made to find political 
solutions to the remaining problems. 
  Before the breakup of the Soviet Union, Kasatonov said, the 
Black Sea Fleet enjoyed, with support from the Rumanian 
[Romanian] and Bulgarian Navies, superiority in both the Black 
and Mediterranean Seas. It was also supported by submarines of 
the Northern Fleet, he said. 
  According to Kasatonov, three quarters of the Black Sea 
coast 
had been working to protect the southern borders of the Soviet 
Union, Rumania [Romania] and Bulgaria. At that time there was 
not a single Turkish ship or submarine in the southern part of 
the Black Sea, Kasatonov said. 
  If a plane took off in Turkey or a naval target appeared, 
Kasatonov said, the Black Sea Fleet came to know about it in no 
time. 
  Kasatonov wished the Ukrainian armed forces had not moved 
its 
attention away from NATO and switched it to the Black Sea Fleet. 
As of date, Kasatonov said, up to 60,000 Ukrainian special and 
other troops were stationed in Crimea. The Black Sea Fleet had 
3,000 Marines and Coast Guards in the same area. 
  Kasatonov said "the destructive Ukrainian forces and the 
British" were planning to celebrate something to be known as the 
Day of the British Soldier in Sebastopol [Sevastopol], to pay 
tribute to the memory of the British troops killed in the 
Crimean War of 1856. Kasatonov said the Russians had four months 
to prepare to honor the memory of the Russian soldiers killed in 
the same war.

"Oleg Soskovets Promises To Liberalize Arms Export"] 
  [Text] Oleg Soskovets, Russian first deputy prime 
minister, who is on a three-day tour of the Volga and Urals 
regions to visit local military-industrial enterprises, has 
attempted to ease tension in the regions over the government's 
failure to pay for defense production manufactured in 1993-94. 
On Monday, in Udmurtia, where the military-industrial sector 
accounts for 80 percent of overall industrial production and 
employs half of all workers, Mr. Soskovets said at a meeting 
with the personnel of the Izhevsk Engineering Plant that some 
problems facing defense enterprises could be resolved by 
liberalizing the export of military goods. 
  "Of course, political objectives must be taken into account, 
but nonetheless we will enable the enterprises to export their 
products on their own," the deputy prime minister said. In his 
words, the state plans to restrict only the export of high-tech 
products that could affect the country's defense capabilities. 
Otherwise, "we will sell whatever they will buy," Mr. Soskovets 
promised. The deputy prime minister also promised on behalf of 
the government that debts to the defense industry will be repaid 
once the federal budget is approved. 
  Also on Monday, a joint meeting of the Russian Federation 
State Defense Industry Committee and the Udmurt Government was 
held. As a result, Viktor Glukhikh, chairman of the State 
Defense Industry Committee, and Udmurt Prime Minister Aleksandr 
Volkov signed an agreement on cooperation in the conversion and 
development of military-industrial sector enterprises. The 
document, which will be in force until 1998, defined areas of 
the development of management, economic, financial, and legal 
ties. The Udmurt government believes that the obligations 
undertaken by Russia will help the republic's economy remain 
more or less stable when converting the defense enterprises for 
civilian uses. 
  Yesterday, Oleg Soskovets arrived in Cheboksary, where he 
met 
with Chuvash President Nikolay Fedorov and visited a number of 
plants -- Khimprom, Promtraktor, and Dieselprom. Today, in 
Ulyanovsk, he is scheduled to visit Russia's largest aviation 
enterprise -- the Aviastr plant.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Yelkov: "If MiGs Could Raise Pollock"] </F>
  [Text] 
<H5>  Bad Luck Army </H5>
  You can still remember the time when all military units 
without exception were anonymous? They dealt with the anonymity 
with military resolve. All the units acquired numbers and many 
of them acquired renown: the 14th army, the 12th post.... 
  Many but not all. The 10th air defense separate army made a 
serious bid for popularity in connection with the violation of 
the air border by a Cessna. But not the Cessna on which Rust 
flew in in May 1987. Later: On 29 May 1988 Mattias Rust's 
instructor tried to repeat his exploit by flying into the zone 
of responsibility of the 10th separate army from the North. 
They did not shoot down the Cessna but simply expelled it. The 
incident because of the speculative interest in facts of a 
directly opposite nature remained unnoticed by the press. The 
10th air defense army nonetheless acquired some renown: After 
the arrest of a general who was chief of the army rear services 
and several of his subordinates. The journalists called the 
trial "the air defense case." A renown which is highly specific 
and even offensive to thousands of officers honorably serving in 
the not very comfortable conditions of the Arctic. Actually, as 
the famous cartoon character wisely noted, good deeds do not 
bring you fame. 
  The 10th army includes all the air defense forces units and 
formations covering the Russian North from the Arctic Amderma to 
Karelia. Hundreds of fighters, powerful radar, and air defense 
missiles. Headquarters in Arkhangelsk. Subordinate to Moscow. 
During the Cold War its regiments and divisions stood loyally as 
a buffer on the routes of strategic bombers to the capital. To 
get through to Moscow they would first have had to destroy the 
10th army. 
  The most modern MiGs and missiles were always in the 10th 
army. But so were the Northernmost townships and garrisons. 
  Today a high price has been paid for former priorities. The 
state has deemed it unnecessary to maintain radar stations and 
airfields in the Arctic. God be with the hardware, but people 
went with the hardware: They had destinies, plans, hopes.... 
On the Arctic islands they have had to abandon considerable 
material assets, homes, barracks (they took decades to settle in 
and just months have been assigned for the evacuation). Perhaps 
the army's reduction will ease the federal coffers? Neither 
today nor in the next year or two. According to the figures of 
Aviation Lieutenant General Gennadiy Vasilyev, commander of the 
10th army, the withdrawal of a few units has cost eight times 
more than their maintenance. 
  The general mood is quite pessimistic. The majority are 
holding out but a feeling of futility and uncertainty has 
already lodged in many hearts. And that is a terrible state. 
It brings any ordinary psychological problem to a dramatic 
finale. On 25 april on a small island of the Novaya Zemlya 
archipelago Captain Andrey Proskurdin, commander of a radar 
company, shot his wife with an assault rifle and then took his 
own life. He left no note. 
  It is not only the regiments of the 10th army that are being 
reduced. No one knows what will happen to the army itself 
tomorrow. In an attempt to prevent mental ferment tempting 
prospects are being outlined for the officers. In newspapers 
Moscow generals discuss the creation of military space defense 
forces. 
  Space is all very well. But it is increasingly difficult 
for the air regiments to break away from the earth. There is no 
kerosine or spare parts. Kilp-Yavr is the 10th army's forward 
airfield not far from Murmansk. Colonel Nikolay Ovechkin's SU-7 
regiment is based here. The pilots' flying time last year 
averaged 30-40 hours. They will hardly fly any more this year. 
Is that a lot or a little. In the Saudi Arabian air force a 
fighter pilot spends 20 hours in the air. But not in a year. A 
month. 
  Incidentally, Western air reconnaissance operators as though 
out of spite are increasing their activity at our borders. 
  The commander of a Norwegian "Orion" ASW aircraft receives 
something like $6,000 a month. Ovechkin's boys, who prevent the 
"Orions" from brazenly covering our submarines with 
hydroacoustic buoys, at least in Russian territorial waters 
(U.S. submariners simply ignore our sovereignty) have not 
received a ruble since January. The coffers of the financial 
section are hopelessly empty. The airmen are writing letters to 
the Chief Military Prosecutor's Office and threatening to go on 
strike. And...they are on duty and guarding the border 
passionately as though to spite someone. 
  Major Vladimir Yelgin, commander of the airfield technical 
backup battalion, says that he has developed a sixth sense as 
yet unknown to science: An inner voice tells him when he should 
leave the headquarters for the airfield to avoid meeting the 
officers' wives. The women bring their children and go to the 
headquarters to ask for the money they themselves and their 
husbands have earned. But where is the battalion commander to 
get this money? 
  In the nearby air defense missile brigade commanded by 
Colonel Sergey Tikhov, the state of affairs as regards paying 
money is similar but here all the scientists have actively been 
procuring mushrooms and berries and dry-curing fish since the 
fall. 
  The brigade is armed with the most sophisticated missiles 
including the "star" of the Abu-Dhabi exhibition, the S-800 
system. Its NATO codename is "Grumble." A most inept name. 
Both the men and the system are remarkable ungrumbling. The 
missiles have been stored in containers without servicing for 10 
years. Such is their design. It must be supposed that is in 
case the Defense Ministry's money dries up completely even for 
the purchase of food for rations and the troops begin to faint 
from hunger. 
  No, no one here is against peace. Even those whose 
profession is preparation for the opposite. But who said that 
an insulting attitude toward the men who carry guns is the path 
toward peace and stability?

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Stanislav Kochemasov by </F>
Aleksandr Dolinin under "Topical Theme" rubric; place and date 
not given: "The World Is Changing, But the Need for Alert Duty 
Remains"] 
  [Text] Articles have been appearing in the press of late 
expressing concern over the status of Russia's Strategic Nuclear 
Forces [SNF]. Some publications are bluntly trying to convince 
the reader that ICBM's are unnecessary. Our correspondent 
turned for clarification to Colonel General Stanislav 
Kochemasov, chief of the Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff. 
  [Dolinin] Stanislav Grigoryevich, what is meant by Russia's 
Strategic Nuclear Forces today? 
  [Kochemasov] The term signifies first and foremost the 
Strategic Missile Forces, the basis of Russia's nuclear might, 
strategic ballistic missile submarine task forces, and strategic 
aviation. We have always been in favor of preserving this triad 
-- only the balanced development of all its components can 
provide the guarantee of high combat effectiveness and the 
capability to execute designated tasks. You know, each 
component of the SNF has its own advantages and the qualities 
attributable to it alone. But given the financial and manpower 
constraints, it will evidently be necessary to grant priority to 
the development of weaponry and troops alike, and to integrate 
offensive and support systems. There was a discussion of these 
questions in the General Staff in April. 
  [Dolinin] How do you envisage integration? 
  [Kochemasov] In order to centralize SNF command and control 
and to determine responsibilty, it would be expedient to set up 
an operations command authority [operativnoye komandovaniye]. 
Administrative leadership, however, would remain with the 
commanders in chief of the various branches of the Armed Forces. 
The preconditions for this already exist, as does the 
possibility of creating a unified system of military command and 
control. But you have to look before you leap.... 
  [Dolinin] What is the place of the Missile Forces in the 
structure of Russia's SNF? 
  [Kochemasov] The Strategic Missile Forces remain their basic 
component -- both in terms of quantity of warheads and in terms 
of a number of other characteristics. This is the objective 
situation now, and it will persist in fact until 2003-2005 -- 
something which is determined not by someone's wish but by the 
building and development of the SNF in previous years. 
  [Dolinin] It seems that in the future, too, the Strategic 
Missile Forces will remain the basis of the SNF. But already, 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA readers are getting the impression that the 
troops are all but completely disarming. Which nuclear missile 
weapons will Russia still have in the years to come? Is it not 
the case that we have been bled dry by the well-known 
Russian-American treaties? 
  [Kochemasov] Several hundred launchers have been withdrawn 
from the effective strength of the Strategic Missile Forces. 
Basically, these are missile complexes [kompleksy] which have 
been in service for twice the warrantied service life. Not a 
single launcher has been removed from alert duty if its 
warrantied service life has not been exhausted. We have kept 
intact the grouping [gruppirovka] of modern missiles. We are 
continuing with the planned commissioning, albeit in a lesser 
quantity, of the Topol mobile missile complexes, which your 
newspaper has already written about. In order to preserve the 
armament and hardware of the two combined units from Belorussia 
[Belarus] we plan to redeploy them to Russia intact. We are 
including an RS 12M complex in the grouping. This complex will 
be the first created exclusively by the cooperation of Russian 
design bureau and plants. Preparations for testing it are 
progressing as planned. An experimental and test base has been 
set up at the Mirnyy test site. The first missile for testing 
systems and power units [sistemy i agregaty] was delivered to 
the test site at the end of 1993. In accordance with an edict 
by the president, the Missile Forces and industrial 
organizations have set about testing the complex. 
  The system of military command and control is being 
improved and modernized. All this is being done so that combat 
potential is maintained at a level guaranteeing deterrence of 
any aggressor. 
  [Dolinin] Are the cutbacks affecting the combat readiness of 
troops? With the elimination of old complexes and the transfer 
to new ones the need for officers does not lessen but, on the 
contrary, increases.... 
  [Kochemasov] First, within the framework of the impending 
modernization of the grouping we plan to retain the existing 
position areas and their attendant infrastructure, 
accommodations, and social and cultural facilities, in order to 
ensure normal living conditions. Second, upon withdrawing 
missile complexes from the effective strength we are leaving 
some of the officer personnel in the newly formed units [chasti] 
or else relocating them to other combined units [soyedineniya]. 
The main problems concern a lack of accommodations, although we 
have steadfastly fulfilled the plan for housing construction 
over the past three or four years. 
  Cutbacks may affect combat readiness to some extent if 
measures are not taken. But the main thing is that we preserve 
a system of centralized military command and control. This 
allows us to maintain the attained level of combat readiness. 
  [Dolinin] The program for developing the weaponry of 
Russia's SNF through the year 2005 stipulates that the basis of 
the Missile Forces will be the Topol single-warhead 
solid-propellant missile for the mobile off-road complex, and 
the Topol M for silo basing. How far does the missile meet this 
purpose, and how reliable is it? How are preparations for 
testing the Topol M progressing? 
  [Kochemasov] The future lies with single-warhead missiles. 
MIRVed missiles will be withdrawn from effective strength as 
their operational life expires, as envisaged by the START II 
Treaty on condition of its ratification. Moreover, 105 MIRVed 
RS-18 (SS-19) missiles will be reequipped with single-warhead 
nose sections and retained until their operational life expires. 
And 90 launch silos for the RS-20 (SS-18) heavy missiles will 
be converted to accommodate the Topol M fixed-site version. 
  The composition of the SNF and the number of delivery 
vehicles must be brought to a level which guarantees the 
solution of the task of strategic deterrence, and it must be 
commensurate with the actual military threat. For the Strategic 
Missile Forces, this level has been set at between 900 and 1,000 
missile launchers by the year 2003. START II allows for their 
number to be increased to between 1,000 and 1,200 missile 
launchers. 
  [Dolinin] Stanislav Grigoryevich, the continued development 
of missile technology is impossible without a solid testing 
base. In this connection, what is the fate of the Kapyar test 
site, and what are its functions today? Is the proposed 
reassigning of the rocket test site at Plesetsk (Mirnyy) to the 
military-space units an appropriate move? 
  [Kochemasov] Extensive and comprehensive ground-based test 
site trials cut the cost of the development [sozdaniye] of any 
complex, inasmuch as they drastically reduce the number of 
missiles required for actual launches. When the capacity of a 
test site is based on the number of missile launches, this has 
to be seen not as an advantage but as a serious shortcoming in 
the methodology of ground-based testing. 
  At the Kapustin Yar test site, individual elements of a 
complexes are tested by firing over short distances using 
inexpensive series-produced carriers [seriyno otrabotannyye i 
deshevyye nositeli]. The main tests of systems and power units, 
the complex as a whole and the missiles, incorporating launches, 
are carried out at the Mirnyy test site. The methodology for 
developing a complex is such that up to 70 percent of the tests 
are conducted on the ground. 
  The question of reassigning the test site is raised from 
time 
to time by the command of the Military-Space Forces. It would 
be an appropriate move if the existing structure and system of 
subordination disrupted or seriously hindered the execution of 
tasks in the new conditions. But it does neither. The problem 
has been studied in depth, and the president of Russia has been 
made aware of the situation. It was deemed advisable to 
preserve the existing system of subordination. The test site's 
30-year history, and the last few years in particular, confirm 
the possibility of resolving all tasks in precisely this 
organizational-regulation structure [organizatsionno-shtatnaya 
struktura]. 
  [Dolinin] In May this year, missile launchers will no longer 
have any targets. There will take place the so-called zero 
targeting agreed with the Americans. Their missiles will be 
targeted on desert regions of the earth insofar as the system of 
military command and control of American ICBM's is somewhat 
different. What will this mean in practice? 
  [Kochemasov] In line with the accords reached and a 
directive from the Russian president, by 31 May the missiles 
will be on alert duty with "zero" mission assignments. Put 
simply, they will not have specific targets. 
  The practical implementation of the nontargeting regime 
depends on the design characteristics of the missile complexes, 
and this will be determined specifically by us and by the 
American side for each type of missile. The common element for 
all, however, is the clear lowering of the sudden-strike 
threshold, inasmuch as a number of operational and technical 
measures will have to be conducted in order to reestablish each 
side's combat plans. This will take time, which the politicians 
can made additional use of to find a peaceful solution to 
problems if they emerge. 
  However the circumstances take shape, the Strategic Missile 
Forces will perform their alert duty. Around 20,000 missilemen 
are at their combat posts around the clock. As they have been 
for virtually the past 35 years. The world is changing, but the 
need for alert duty has not disappeared.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel Gennadiy Miranovich of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA </F>
under the rubric "View of Problem": "In the Snare of Populist 
Decisions, Or Returning Once More to the Topic of What Kind of 
Army Russia Needs"] 
  [Text] Don't you think, esteemed reader, that the two 
years of the existence of the Russian Army have witnessed 
changes not only in the appearance and content of the state's 
military machine proper but also in our attitudes toward this 
machine, in society's "defense consciousness," so to speak? 
Here are just a few indications. 
  The Armed Forces, which a little while ago were diligently 
defamed by speakers at microphones, on television, and in 
newspaper pages, can today be said to be being advertised at 
state level. It looks as though the lofty concept of 
"patriotism," which had almost been reduced to an expletive, is 
again beginning to acquire its proper sound at that level, and a 
new section entitled "Moral and Psychological Support" has 
actually appeared in the Ground Forces Field Manual. Amendments 
are being made to earlier decisions connected with drafting 
Russian citizens for military service. The question of the 
strength of the Armed Forces, which had seemed a dead issue, is 
again the subject of debate.... 
  What do these and other "amendments" concerning spheres of 
vital importance to the state show? Primarily that it is 
obvious that some of the decisions made in the past on the crest 
of a wave of populism are not in line with today's realities. 
It is not easy to admit this. But there is nothing to be done, 
we will have to find the strength and courage, if not to repent, 
then at least to attempt as far as possible to eliminate 
excesses where they have been allowed to occur. After all, 
there is a great deal at stake -- the security of the state. 
  In the opinion of a number of experts, the rule introduced 
into effect by Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Decree No 
3532-1 of 24 September 1992 whereby the strength of the Russian 
Armed Forces must not exceed 1 percent of the country's 
population can be included among decisions of this kind. What 
prompted this rule? Was it taken into account that the specifics 
of the organizational development of the Russian Army are 
determined not only by the fact that it is being created on the 
basis of the USSR Armed Forces but also by the fact that it must 
accord with the level of real military danger and the new 
geopolitical and other realities? 
  First, as has already been said, a great deal was done back 
then in an ecstasy of populism: The Army is "eating the country 
out of house and home," it has "more generals than all the 
world's armies added together," "no one is threatening us," and 
so on, and so forth. Second, the real challenges of the time 
were not sufficiently clear to make it possible to calculate 
everything accurately. We have now "wised up," because we have 
a military doctrine providing a sufficiently clear idea of the 
state's views of defense tasks. But back then? It is no secret 
that some people in parliament saw the future Russian Army as 
something like a small national guard designed to combat natural 
disasters and calamities. 
  Of course, there could be no question of keeping 2.8 million 
men under arms (that is how many there were in Russia at the 
time of the president's edict on creating its Armed Forces). 
Intensive cuts began within the framework of the reform of the 
Army and Navy. In particular, during the second stage of the 
reforms (1993-1995) it was proposed to have 2.1 million men and 
during the third (after 1995) it was proposed to have 1.5 
million. Is this a lot or a little so far as Russia is 
concerned? We will clearly have a final answer upon completion 
of the studies to substantiate the structure, composition, and 
strength of the Armed Forces for the period after 1995 that are 
currently under way in parallel with the elaboration of a 
blueprint for their organizational development in the long term. 
As for the opinions of various experts, academics, and 
specialists, they still cover quite a broad spectrum. 
  Probably the most popular idea, now commonplace, is that 
almost one of the main ways of stabilizing Russia's budget is 
the continuous and intensive reduction of military spending by 
cutting the strength of the Armed Forces. The reasoning is that 
their strength, even in their reduced form, will substantially 
exceed the strength of the armies of the most developed European 
states -- Germany, France, Britain. 
  I will not venture to judge the validity of such arguments 
from the scientific viewpoint. I will leave that to academics. 
But I cannot remain silent about something that seems to me to 
be obvious. What is obvious is our vast country which is unique 
in its geopolitical situation. 
  Yes, Russia's position in the post-Soviet space is such that 
it is now separated from the West European countries not only by 
the Central and East European countries but also by a second 
"belt" -- the Baltic countries, Belorussia [Belarus], Ukraine, 
Moldavia [Moldova]. The length of coastline in the west and 
south has been sharply reduced. But at the same time from the 
geopolitical viewpoint Russia retains many elements of the 
USSR's position. Its territory is at the intersection between 
Europe and Asia and it has common borders with Christian (in the 
west) and Muslim (in the south) states and with countries with a 
Confucian ideology (in the east). The shores of Russia are 
washed by the waters of 12 seas and three oceans, and it retains 
long maritime borders in the north and east. On top of that you 
have abundant natural wealth and direct encirclement by more 
than 10 states, most of which have either acute claims on Russia 
or a serious interest in it. All this objectively compels us to 
seek our own ways of ensuring the homeland's security, including 
via determining the optimum strength of the Armed Forces. 
  For instance, take the southern section of Russia's flank 
region. In the USSR, as is well known, the North Caucasus 
Military District was in the rear. This accordingly influenced 
its tasks, structure, and manning level, and the orientation of 
troop training. Now it is a border district. Moreover, the 
situation there requires an adequate military presence on 
Russia's part, so to speak. All this must be taken into account 
somehow. 
  Now let us turn to the range of tasks which, according to 
the 
provisions of the military doctrine, Russia's Army and Navy must 
be ready to resolve. The main danger to stability and peace, 
the doctrine asserts, is now local wars and armed conflicts. 
But at the same time it is not ruled out that in specific 
conditions these may develop into a large-scale war. 
Consequently we must be concerned in advance to ensure that the 
combat potential of general-purpose forces is at a level 
guaranteeing the repulse of aggression and that it can be 
rapidly increased in the event of an increase in the scale of 
military operations. 
  Moreover, the doctrine envisages the possibility of using 
individual Armed Forces formations to assist internal affairs 
organs and MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] internal troops in 
localizing and blockading conflict zones, stopping armed clashes 
and separating the warring sides, and also protecting 
strategically important facilities. The Armed Forces may be 
entrusted with tasks of assisting the Border Troops in guarding 
the state border and assisting other forces in guarding maritime 
communications, important state facilities, and economic zones 
and combating terrorism, illegal drug trafficking and piracy. 
It is not impossible that the Armed Forces could be used to 
assist the population in eliminating the consequences of 
industrial and environmental calamities and natural disasters. 
  Let us also not forget a task that is fundamentally new to 
us 
-- participation by the Armed Forces in UN peacemaking 
operations, and also in collective peacekeeping forces inside 
the CIS. Suffice it to say that last year the general troop 
grouping performing these tasks had one army, one army corps, 
two divisions, four brigades, and 10 regiments. All this must 
also be taken into account in determining the strength of the 
Armed Forces. 
  Yes, we are now oriented toward mobile defense. And it would 
naturally be excellent to have small but quite powerful mobile 
forces ready for operational use wherever a real threat to 
Russia's security arises -- this could compensate to the maximum 
extent for the sharp reduction in the strength of peacetime 
troop (forces) groupings. But mobile forces, as a new 
interbranch strategic-operational formation, are at present only 
just being set up. Today the foundation of the Russian Armed 
Forces consists of their five branches: Strategic Missile 
Forces, Ground Forces, Air Defense Forces, Air Forces, Naval 
Forces. And this will remain for the transitional period, 
because to change within a short time the historical 
table-of-organization structure and systems of control, 
training, armament, logistical support, and so forth 
characteristic of each branch of the Armed Forces would require 
material expenditure that is beyond our capacity today. 
  Furthermore, in the opinion of knowledgeable people with 
whom I have discussed this topic, even once the principle of 
mobile defense has been implemented, at least 2 million men will 
be required in order to create troop groupings capable of 
responding appropriately to an increase in the military threat 
in a specific region by moving mobile Armed Forces components to 
the scene. Thus here too we must calculate and calculate.... 
  Probably in time the strengthening of Russia's links with 
the 
world community and the creation of a new collective military 
security system in Europe and the world will enable us to 
substantially change the structure of the Armed Forces, the 
correlation between their branches, and the principles for the 
creation and structure of troop groupings and forces in 
peacetime and wartime. But that is in the future. Like, 
incidentally, the equipping of the Army and Navy with the most 
modern means of armed struggle, which will also help to reduce 
the number of personnel. At the moment we are stuck with what we 
have got. We should clearly proceed from this fact in seeking a 
way out of the snare of populist decisions in which we find 
ourselves.

<F P=106> [Report by Arkadiy Zheludkov: "After Murder at Missile </F>
Complex"] 
  [Excerpts] In its issue no. 57 for 26 March IZVESTIYA 
reported a tragedy in a strategic missile regiment: Private 
Alik Oshurbekov, who had gone on duty to guard the ICBM complex, 
killed guard chief Lieutenant Garkusha and his fellow soldier 
Private Shuktovev, and seriously wounded two more servicemen -- 
Oleg Kozub and Vasiliy Kopylov. To find out how this strange 
story ended and what conclusions were drawn after a soldier had 
contrived to capture a nuclear missile complex, our 
correspondent flew to Altay. [passage omitted] 
  There is no need now to recall the details of the incident 
-- 
that is the belief of the military prosecutor's office in Altay. 
A little later Mikhail Tolkachev, deputy military prosecutor, 
admits that the missile division is not subordinate in any way 
to the local military prosecutor's office! I do not know how 
far this is the case and how far it is an attempt to protect 
military honor. The fact is that the district military 
prosecutor's office investigators never tried to study the 
circumstances of the case. And since the tragic evening the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service, which (as the KGB) used to 
have strict control over missile units, has not once interfered 
in the case, at least officially. 
  Yet it is not difficult to penetrate to the territory of the 
missile unit in the settlement of Sibirskiy (the missile 
division headquarters): At the checkpoint you can say severely 
to the guard: "I'm in a hurry, I have come to see Major X." 
And the guard will lazily admit you to the division compound. 
Getting through to the military township territory is even 
simpler. And division officers who are witnesses say that, 
apart from the above-mentioned shooting incident it has recently 
become customary for the missile division units to be cut off 
from the power supply -- for failing to settle accounts for 
electricity. In that time damage which cannot be compared with 
any other catastrophes could have been inflicted on the country 
-- the missile tracking complexes were virtually immobilized for 
a long time.... 
<H5>  Failure of U.S. Investigation of Tragedy </H5>
  The missile division headquarters in Sibirskiy appeared to 
the U.S. military government inspectors in all its glory: The 
Russian command was obliged to report within a day to the U.S. 
Government any conflict in the compound of any strategic missile 
unit. And suddenly the Americans learned of the danger of a 
nuclear explosion not from their Russian counterparts in the 
treaty but from the Russian mass media -- the newspapers 
ALTAYSKAYA PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA and the INTERFAX news agency. 
The Americans needed just four hours in all at the missile 
division headquarters to understand that Russia is not a country 
where one can learn the reason for a conflict and predict 
methods of preventing similar incidents. 
  On the Barnaul airfield runway the leader of the U.S. 
military delegation merely shrugged when your IZVESTIYA 
correspondent asked him what he thinks of the incident. The 
point is that not only did the Americans not see Oshurbekov but 
they failed to understand from the division investigation 
materials why the soldier opened fire. "This fact gives you the 
right to hope that in the very near future Russia will learn of 
the capture of a U.S. nuclear missile complex only from the mass 
media," was more or less the interpretation of the U.S. 
delegation's mood by the interpreter, the only military 
specialist dressed in the uniform of the U.S. Navy -- all the 
others were in civilian clothing. 
  The Americans flew off without having gotten an answer to 
questions about the safety of Russian nuclear missile complexes. 
Yet only three years ago their military specialists highly 
assessed the Soviet "SS" missile pods [bloki]. Unfortunately, as 
the Americans noted, the U.S. Government can now no longer be 
sure of its Russian partners. 
<H5>  Secrets Again </H5>
  The incident in March at the ICBM missile unit became known 
in Altay Kray only thanks to the efforts of Oleg Loginov, an 
ALTAYSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent, and the IZVESTIYA item. 
Following these reports questions rained down on both editorial 
offices: "How do you know that the explosion of the missile fuel 
tank was dangerous to the surrounding population?" IZVESTIYA 
received the following complaint from a retired colonel, one of 
the creators of modern missiles which took over from the "SS" 
missiles in Altay Kray: "The 12 systems for protecting a 
warhead are a military secret," the military engineer said. 
"Our missiles are absolutely safe and will not blow up even if 
a mad soldier sets fire to them." 
  I shall answer as follows. No one has ever tried to set fire 
to ICBM's but on the day of the shooting at the security 
positions near Bayunovskiye Klyuchi the situation was very close 
to a combat one -- the missile troops guard service regulations 
say that shots in the direction of missiles are forbidden even 
if enemy scouting and sabotage groups appear. To this day the 
majority of the missile troops division officers have heard 
nothing about the capture of a strategic missiles guard combat 
vehicle by a rank and file soldier. Many officers thought that 
this incident was a joke put about by the vigilant first 
department.... 
  The chaste silence of Colonel Vladimir Parmenov, commander 
of 
the Siberian missile troops division, was described by a 
Japanese correspondent who found out the truth over the 
telephone as an act of compiling a report for the public press. 
"Of course," said the naive Japanese journalist. "The military 
must be answerable to the civilian population for a threat to 
the country's security?" 
  And only the counterintelligence officer who informed me of 
the state of affairs from the missile division told me that 
Private Oshurbekov "must have gone mad." That is the only way 
the missile division command could explain one soldier's 
unpunished capture of the ICBM position. 
<H5>  "Hero" Safely Hidden Away </H5>
  When I visited the Sibirskiy settlement Private Oshurbekov 
was not there -- his trail was lost somewhere during the 
investigation. It is known that by the time the Americans flew 
in the notorious soldier had been detained for psychiatric 
examination. And it was hinted to me at the division 
headquarters that long before the U.S. Government delegation 
arrived Alik Oshurbekov had committed suicide -- at the 
guardhouse. [passage omitted] 
  According to the information I acquired in Barnaul, at the 
time of my trip the ill-starred soldier was in the Kazan special 
regime clinic for the detention of mentally ill citizens who 
have committed particularly dangerous crimes. Whether the 
soldier's placing in a psychiatric clinic was justified, time 
will show: Psychiatric specialists say that such patients in 
Altay Kray have always had one path -- Kazan, Omsk, or 
Altayskaya Berezovska -- and a person's trail is lost there. 
But was it so necessary to draft into military service a young 
man "unable to control his actions at moments of anger," as Alik 
Oshurbekov was described by one of his former commanders, this 
conclusion stemming from draftee Alik Oshurbekov's personal file. 
  Where is the guarantee that one day soon another psychopath, 
better informed than Oshurbekov of the potential of nuclear 
missiles, will not capture another complex and blackmail us with 
the threat of nuclear catastrophe? Let us hope that the missile 
units command will help IZVESTIYA readers to get an answer to 
the mysteries of Private Oshurbekov's case.

  [Text] Flight Control Centre (Moscow region) May 17 TASS -- 
Cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev, Yuriy Usachev and Valeriy Polyakov 
continue their space mission aboard the Mir space station. 
  The crew devoted much time over the past few days to 
geophysical explorations fulfilled with the use of photographic 
equipment and videospectromic instrumentation installed on the 
Kvant-2 module. 
  They made snapshots of the areas of Chernobyl and the Aral 
sea, agricultural lands in the Krasnodar territory and the 
Kalmyk Republic as well as industrial areas in Kazakhstan. 
  Under the programme of experiments on extra-atmospheric 
astronomy, the cosmonauts carried out several sessions of 
observations and registation of galactic and extra-galactic 
sources of roentgen radiation. They also continued to measure 
spectres of space radiation in various ranges of wave lengths. 
The aim of the explorations is to get scientific information on 
interaction between physical processes in the universe and 
near-Earth space. 
  An adjustment of the station's orbit was made on May 16 with 
the propulsion unit of the Progress M-2 spacecraft. 
  The flight plan for Tuesday provides for astrophysical, 
medical and technical experiments, re-equipment of the station 
and modules with new instrumentation brought to the station by a 
ferry. 
  The cosmonauts feel well. Work aboard the station proceeds 
normally.

  [Text] The launch of the spacecraft Soyuz TM-19 scheduled 
for June 20 1994 is likely to be postponed, the press service of 
the Flight Control Center in Kaliningrad, Moscow region, told 
Interfax. Soyuz was to deliver a new crew, Yuriy Malenchenko and 
Talgat Musabayev, to the orbit station Mir. 
  Commenting on the statement, the head of the manned flights 
and carriers department of the Russian Space Agency, Mikhail 
Sinelschikov, told Interfax that "an official decision had not 
yet been made, but the postponement may be caused by production 
problems concerning the manufacturing of a shield for Soyuz 
TM-19." 
  According to unofficial sources, the launch will take place 
no earlier than July 20 1994. 
  Malenchenko and Musabayev will work on the manned orbit 
complex Mir for 135 days as the main crew of the 16th

stay even longer -- 429 days.

  [Text] Sergey Shakhray who submitted his resignation from 
the post of deputy prime minister to the president and prime 
minister has told Interfax that on Tuesday morning he met Boris 
Yeltsin and gave his reasons. 
  Asked about the president's response to Shakhray's ideas he 
said Yeltsin promised to think them over. Shakhray did not have 
reasons to believe that the resignation would not be accepted. 
  After resignation he is planning to concentrate on his work 
in the State Duma and the strengthening of local branches of his 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord. Shakhray is also convinced 
that his resignation will not have "avalanche consequences" for 
other members of his party in the cabinet: the Minister of 
Economy Aleksandr Shokhin, the Minister of Labor Gennadiy 
Melikyan and the Minister of Justice Yuriy Kalmykov. 
  According to Shakhray, Russia is now at a crossroads, like a 
legendary Russian warrior having to choose one of three roads: 
to chaos, to transformation into a police state or to the 
formation of a full-fledged federation with broad rights of 
local government bodies. To make the last option a reality 
several fundamental steps should be taken. 
  Firstly, Shakhray thinks the president and prime minister 
should start playing the part of arbiters in society. Secondly, 
the hard core of a confederation should be formed in the 
framework of the CIS so that the process is not led by such 
extremists as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Thirdly, Russia should 
start truly protecting the rights and interests of Russians in 
former Soviet republics. In the fourth place, Shakhray is 
convinced, "basic order should be restored" and spending on the 
government machinery reduced. In the fifth place, crime should 
be resolutely combatted. In the sixth place, a common national 
idea should be worked out. In Shakhray's opinion this should be 
the idea of reviving Russia. 
  If the authorities remain inactive and fail to achieve 
political accord and resolve the problem of mutual debts in the 
economy, Shakhray predicts developments "according to the 
gloomiest script". 
  Here is his vision of this script. In July there will be 
mass strikes and unrest among work collectives, primarily in the 
defence industry. This, according to Shakhray, can lead to the 
resignation of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in August. 
The situation can be such that Chernomyrdin will have to go 
himself in order to ease the social tension. In this case 
Shakhray named as possible candidates to the post the Moscow 
Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, Deputy Prime- Minister Oleg Soskovets and 
the Chairman of the Federation of Manufacturers Yuriy Skokov. 
  However, Shakhray foresees great difficulties with the 
approval of any of these candidates by the Duma. This can lead 
to calls for the dissolution of the lower house of parliament. 
In such circumstances the Council of the Federation could 
become opposed to the president. As a result the situation in 
October could be similar to the one in October 1993. 
  Shakhray also thinks that Chernomyrdin can keep his cabinet 
unchanged only if he manages to resolve the problem of mutual 
debts. 
  He went on to say that he sympathizes with the head of 
government adding that he did not have any conflicts with either 
Chernomyrdin or Yeltsin.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Alexandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Vice-Premier Sergey Shakhray 
spelled out on Tuesday his reasons for resigning as Russian 
vice-premier, announcing a statement at a news conference at the 
Russian Foreign Ministry press centre, which he sent to the 
president and the prime minister. 
  "In connection with the appointment of a new minister for 
nationalities and regional policy, even without taking formally 
into account the opinion of the vice-premier in charge of the 
nationalities and regional policy, I request you to release me 
from the post of deputy prime minister," the document says. 
  "I'd like to hope that the appointment of a new minister is 
not connected with my order on financial inspection at the 
former state committee for the north's affairs as well as with 
the pressure of various groups from the Krasnodar Territory and 
their representatives in Moscow," Shakhray stressed. 
  According to Shakhray, his resignation "does not mean he 
would join the opposition to the president and the government 
and does not mean any personal offence", "although I'm also a 
man", he added. 
  He noted that his resignation points to his unwillingness to 
hold up to any posts. [as received] 
  He did not feel any resentment against the president or the 
government, and he would not make any opposition statements, 
Shakhray assured. "I hope they have no grounds to make serious 
reproaches against me," he said, adding that he had no conflicts 
either with the president or the premier. "I have not got any 
reprimands for the nationalities and regional policy," Shakhray 
underlined. 
  The vice-premier singled out in the statement achievements 
scored by his Ministry for Nationalities and Regional Policy. 
Firstly, the ministry ended to draft the concept of a state 
regional policy. [as received] 
  Secondly, the concept of a state policy towards Cossacks has 
been drafted. Thirdly, the drafting of a concept on local 
self-rule and and national-cultural autonomy is nearing 
completion. 
  Fourthly, a great amount of work has been done to delimit 
powers between members of the Russian Federation and to 
implement the federal treaty. The treaty with Tatarstan came 
into force. 
  The draft economic agreements and draft treaties with the 
Kaliningrad region, Kabardino-Balkaria and Bashkiria have been 
prepared. Cooperation with inter-regional economic associations 
has been started. The government drafted and initialled the 
general agreement with all the eight inter-regional economic 
associations. 
  The ministry laid foundations to normalise relations with 
the 
Chechen republic and to settle the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. 
"The consistent and active work with members of the federation 
ensured their support for the president and the government 
during the days of difficult political crises," Shakhray noted. 
He wished great success to new Minister Nikolay Yegorov. 
  Speaking about his deputies at the Ministry for 
Nationalities 
and Regional Policy, the ex-minister specified that Ramazan 
Abdulatipov left the ministry right after his election to the 
post of deputy speaker of the Russian parliament upper house. 
  Aleksandr Kontenkov will continue to work with new Minister 
Nikolay Yegorov. Other representatives of the party of Russian 
Unity and Accord (Russian abbreviation "PRES") headed by 
Shakhray -- the ministers of economics, labour and justice will 
remain at their posts. 
  "There will be no avalache consequences of my resignation 
for 
my party colleagues," he continued. "My resignation does not 
change the attitude of the PRES to the president and the 
government. 
  "We shall support all their moves aimed at creating a real 
federation and local self-rule," he added. 
  Asked about his nearest political plans, Shakhray replied 
that he will work to consolidate his party and will devote much 
effort to work at the lower house.

  [Text] Moscow, 17 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Government Chairman 
Viktor Chernomyrdin today assembled a large conference of the 
heads of the machinery of government and its structural 
subdivisions on the results of his working meeting with the 
president of the Russian Federation. This was announced by the 
government's press service. 
  The conference was attended by deputy chairmen of the 
government and the heads of a number of ministries in the 
economic field. Serious criticisms were made of the staff's 
style and methods of work, the level of control over the 
implementation of the decisions accepted, and the time taken for 
documents submitted to the staff to be considered. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin told the heads of the apparat's 
structural subdivisions to adopt exhaustive measures to raise 
the level of executive discipline and gave a tough indication of 
the heads' personal responsibility for the conduct of reform and 
the implementation of concrete measures to stabilize the 
finances and the economy, the government press service 
announcement says.

  [Text] Moscow, 17 May (ITAR-TASS) -- This is not the best 
time to relieve Shakhray of his post. This was the opinion 
expressed today in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent 
by Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma committee for 
CIS affairs. 
  Commenting on yesterday's report on "Russia" TV channel that 
Shakhray, relieved of the post of minister of affairs of 
nationalities and regional policy, could resign today from the 
post of vice-premier, Konstantin Zatulin said that according to 
his information Sergey Shakhray had to have a series of talks 
and meetings on this subject. Konstantin Zatulin believes that, 
in any case, it is the soveriegn right of Sergey Shakhray 
himself to make such a decision.

  [Text] Deputy Chairman of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Concord Konstantin Zatulin regretted the form in which the last 
reshuffling in the government had taken place, for instance the 
dismissal of Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policies 
Sergey Shakhray and appointment of Nikolay Yegorov to this post. 
Zatulin stated this in an interview with Interfax today. 
  Earlier, Shakhray had announced his resignation as the 
Russian Vice Premier at a briefing in Moscow explaining this by 
the fact that the appointment of the new minister had not been 
even formally discussed with him. 
  Zatulin (who is also Chairman of the State Duma Committee on 
CIS) suggested that Shakhray had been caught in a trap. 
  "It is no secret that the president's administration and the 
government are fighting between them for powers and authority. 
It is not by chance that the rough dismissal of Sergey Shakhray 
in the best traditions of the Russian bureaucracy was announced 
when implementation of the ideas of Shakhray and the Party of 
Russian Integrity and Concord started -- the one on the Civic 
Accord Pact and on settlement of inter-ethnic relations," 
Zatulin pointed out. 
  On the question whether the positions of the party in the 
government would be weakened after the dismissal of Shakhray, 
Zatulin suggested that for the time-being any party better be 
outside the government than participate in it. Zatulin said his 
party aimed to serve Russia rather than the president or the 
premier. 
  From this point of view the party has supported the 
activities of Shakhray in the government which are continued by 
Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, Minister of Justice Yuriy 
Kalmykov and Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan who are members of 
the Party of Russian Integrity and Concord, Zatulin stressed.

  [Text] Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray sent his letter of 
resignation to the president today. By doing so, he expressed 
his disagreement with the procedure for appointing Nikolay 
Yegorov, the new minister for affairs of nationalities. We 
would like to recall that there were no consultations with 
Shakhray, although he as the vice premier was in charge of 
national issues. 
  However, Moscow's political circles have a different 
explanation on the reasons for the resignation. Of late 
Shakhray's department was overseeing Russia's northern regions, 
for whose support credits amounting to several trillion rubles 
were allocated. Observers believe that the true reasons for the 
resignation are disagreements in the Russian leadership on who 
will be sharing out these credits, and how this will be done.

  [Text] The dismissal of Deputy Prime Minister Sergey 
Shakhray from the post of minister for nationalities and 
regional policies is a "great mistake of the Russian 
leadership," Interfax was told Tuesday by the leader of the 
Chechen opposition Umar Avtunkhanov. He said that Shakhray was 
the only person in the Russian leadership who knew the situation 
in the regions, for example, in the North Caucasus. 
  Until the last day in power Shakhray headed the Russian 
delegation at the talks with Chechnya. 
  Avturkhanov believes that Shakhray's dismissal was done by 
the middle echelons of power in Russia, who are connected with 
President Dzhokhar Dudayev through oil products and arms. 
  Shakhray was dismissed at the moment when Russia developed a 
more or less concrete position concerning the ethnic policies, 
for example, concerning the settlement of relations with 
Chechnya, said Avturkhanov. 
  Meanwhile, the official Groznyy welcomed with satisfaction 
Shakhray's resignation. In an interview with Interfax, the 
Chechen president's aide Soltmurat Alazov said that this should 
have taken place long ago. 
  The man whose unseemly role is vividly seen in the 
Ossetian-Ingushi conflict, could not occupy the post of minister 
for nationalities and regional policies for very long, said the 
aide.

  [Text] Chechen parliament's Speaker Akhyad Idigov did not 
rule out that after the dismissal of Sergey Shakhray from the 
post of the Russian Minister for Nationalities and Regional 
Policies the policy of Russia towards Chechnya could toughen. 
Idigov said in an interview with Interfax today that he saw no 
connection between the dismissal of Shakhray and his tough 
position to Chechnya. 
  "This policy is being defined either by more high-ranking 
officials or by the Russian legislative institutions," Idigov 
stated having concluded that the policy of Russia towards 
Chechnya could not be altered much after the dismissal of one 
politician. 
  "If the Russian leadership wanted to alter its policy it 
would do this even without consulting Shakhray," Idigov 
suggested. 
  "It is likely that his policy has just come to a deadlock 
and 
it was high time to dismiss him," Idigov concluded.

  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- "The difficult arguments on 
property, land and taxes, occurring ever more frequently among 
the parties to market relations in Russia, bring to light all 
the merits and still large demerits of our civil law," Chairman 
of the Russian Supreme Court of Arbitration Veniamin Yakovlev 
told the international conference on civil legislation, which 
opened here today. 
  Yakovlev expressed the hope that this meeting would "help 
establish truly democratic laws for the everyday life of our 
democratic society". The conference was organised by the 
Institute of Law and Comparative Jurisprudence under the Russian 
Government, jointly with the Supreme Court of Arbitation. It is 
being attended by members of the private law centre under the 
Russian president, jurists, economists, and businessmen from the 
CIS countries and other foreign states. 
  The 1964 civil code of the Russian Soviet Federative 
Socialist Republic, which is now in force, was drawn up to 
service the administrative-command system and, of course, does 
not guarantee contractual freedom in the new economic 
conditions, the speakers noted. Moreover, it legalises the 
inequality of the forms of ownership, giving preference to 
state-owned property. 
  The adoption of the new Russian civil code must be 
accelerated to ensure legal backing to the market economy. The 
parliamentary hearings on its draft, to which the participants 
of the conference were invited, will be held at the State Duma 
building on May 19. The civil code must be "a fundamental law, 
laying down the overall legal principles of market relationships 
in the country". 
  The private law, which is now being revived in Russia, must 
protect the people's ownership rights, including the right to 
the results of intellectual labour, must regulate relations 
among people, based on equality. Several such laws are already 
in force, including the laws on privatisation, business 
transactions, banks, investments, competition, restriction of 
monopolism, copyrights and attendant rights. Laws have also 
been adopted to protect the rights of consumers, to guarantee 
the free movement of citizens, and the freedom of the mass 
media. However, they do not regulate all the spheres of the 
market economy and all the relationships between the civilian 
society and the private life of citizens. 
  The conference participants plan to address recommendations, 
linked with the elaboration of the Russian civil legislation, to 
the Federal Assembly (parliament) of Russia and to the 
parliaments of other CIS states.

the Russian Federation and to the head of the government. 
  In the document, Sergey Shakhray asked that he be released 
from his post of deputy chairman of the government "in 
connection with the appointment of a new minister of 
nationalities and regional policy even without taking into 
formal account the opinion of the deputy prime minister in 
charge of these problems" 
  Sergey Shakhray said his resignation "does not mean he is 
leaving to join the opposition to the president and the 
government and does not signify any insult."

  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister 
Sergey Shakhray predicted on Tuesday that a new major stand off 
between authorities, worse that the one which took place last 
October, is in store for Russia in August if urgent measures are 
not taken to improve the economic situation. 
  Last October at least 140 people were killed in Moscow 
during 
the armed opposition revolt. 
  "If the problem of mutual indebtedness of enterprises is not 
urgently solved the government will not survive. It is possible 
that in August head of the government Viktor Chernomyrdin will 
have to offer resignation on his own initiative to save the 
situation", Shakhray told a press conference. 
  The resignation, according to Shakhray, will be preceeded in 
July by mass protests among workers of defence enterprises. 
  Attempts to appoint a new prime minister will trigger a 
stand 
off between the lower chamber and the president and "scenarios 
of dissolving the State Duma" will appear. As a result the 
other chamber, the Federation Council, will move to opposition 
to Boris Yeltsin, he said. 
  "And finally the last October situation may repeat, but in a 
worse variant", Shakhray said and added that "this is the worst 
scenario, but it is quite possible if the mentioned measures are 
not taken". 
  Besides the problem of mutual indebtedness, the measures 
include the necessity to make all those parties which signed the 
civic accord treaty to work for reforms. The president and the 
government should act as an arbiter in pursuing the economic and 
political interests of Russia. They have to initiate a dialogue 
with representatives of the fuel and energy industry, the 
military- industrial complex, with agrarians and bankers in 
order to solve the problem of indebtedness and to change the 
taxation and banking system, Shakhray said. 
  Among possible successors to Chernomyrdin he sees Moscow 
Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets, and 
former Security Council Chairman Yuriy Skokov.

  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Industrial production slump in 
Russia in the past month amounted to 50 percent of the 1991 
level. The Russian economy has hit the bottom line, and must now 
stabilise and improve, according to the Russian president's 
analytical centre chief Yevgeniy Yasin. 
  Yasin told journalists at a press conference here that he 
expected a u-turn from the end of 1994 when the slump will have 
reached 20-25 percent of the 1993 level. "The situation will 
stabilise then," Yasin predicted. 
  "This is much better than a lesser slump for a longer 
period, 
including 1995 and 1996," Yasin assured the journalists. He 
also said the government has scored several successes in 
combatting inflation. As of May 10, the inflation rate was 
registered at 2- 2.5 percent and it is unlikely to exceed the 
level by the end of the month. 
  More, the presidential analyst said the first signs of 
stabilisation are already evident, almost a year ahead of the 
deadline provided for in the program adopted by the Russian 
Government on August 6,1993.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The press service of 
the president of the Russian Federation reports that today 
President Boris Yeltsin has by his edict ordered territories in 
two rayons to be regarded as rayons of the Far North, and the 
territories of 14 rayons and the town of Kyzyl of the Republic 
of Tyva to be regarded as localities that are on the same 
footing as Far North rayons. This is because of the combination 
of extreme environmental and climatic conditions and social and 
economic conditions in which the population of the Republic of 
Tyva live.

  [Text] Moscow May 16 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin will 
be the strongest candidate in the upcoming presidential 
elections, State Duma deputy Yegor Gaydar said. 
  Speaking before an audience of students and scholars at the 
Moscow State University on Monday, Gaydar said his Russia's 
Choice bloc will support Yeltsin. 
  He said the elections will not be easy, but Yeltsin has the 
best chances of all democratic candidates. Gaydar stressed that 
lawmakers must join their efforts in order to stop local 
conflicts and ward off the danger of communist revenge. 
  To this end, the bloc will be reorganised into a party with 
fixed membership. Draft charter and programme of the new party 
are already ready. The founding congress will be held in Moscow 
on June 12-13. 
  Gaydar believes that Russian business people may count on a 
certain place in the political arena only if they team up with 
intellectuals. 
  Speaking about privatisation, Gaydar described it as a "task 
which has no optimum solution, only a more or less acceptable. 
We have to make not an ideal, but possible decision."

<F P=106> [Arkadiy Zheludkov report: "On the War Path. Soiree for </F>
Yesterday's DEN or Today's ZAVTRA"] 
  [Text] The soiree for the spiritual opposition newspaper 
ZAVTRA in the weight-lifting room at the Izmaylovo sports 
complex, which was filled to bursting, resembled least of all a 
quiet celebration of yesterday's DEN; it was more like the rally 
by the supporters of resolute action to restore Soviet power 
that began 9 May, involving virtually the same people, the same 
demands, and the same confidence in the future. 
  The soiree's leaders ascended the weight-lifting podium with 
confident stride: At the head came Aleksandr Rutskoy, like a 
standard bearer, with everyone else behind. Rutskoy was the 
first to speak after the soiree's master of ceremonies, 
Aleksandr Prokhanov. The former vice president's speech was not 
very reminiscent of his first meeting with a national-patriotic 
audience, in the Rossiya movie theater -- the former pilot did 
not have his usual sheet of paper, and there were none of the 
usual prompters to tell him the correct pronunciation of the 
names of Russian philosophical theoreticians. To quote the 
state's former number two, the first thing that troubled 
Aleksandr Rutskoy was the reason for the gathering. Forgetting 
that he was just the first act in a preplanned spectacle, the 
general asked his audience and comrades in arms: "What brings 
us together?" Lust for power or the desire to live a worthy 
life? However, Aleksandr Rutskoy soon made it clear that he was 
only reiterating ideas voiced 9 May and that the purpose of the 
gathering was to prepare everything to celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of the victory in time for 9 May 1995 and the 
personal victory over "Yeltsin's and Kozyrev's mongrel policy." 
  Then came Ilya Konstantinov's recollections of his 
impressions after reading a book by Victor Hugo; Aleksandr 
Prokhanov's repeated assurances that all the people gathered 
here were free agents (the soiree did indeed begin at 1830 hours 
and, judging by the mood of the audience, no one was in a hurry 
to go home). Aleksandr Prokhanov, who usually complains about 
the dominance of the democratic press, suddenly bragged that the 
opposition has around 100 newspapers countrywide and said that 
he still remembers a dark corridor at "Ostankino," two candles, 
and then the office of General Achalov, who told all the "mass 
media" forthwith: "We want peace, but let them return their 
plunder." And he also asked for the Soviet armed forces' 
reputation to be restored. 
  The undoubted highlight of the evening was Nevzorov, who 
described the "charming agrarians" now in the Duma who "wear the 
same suit throughout their working life," and how Burbulis 
behaves when he sits next to him at meetings, and finally made 
the optimistic promise that "everything will be restored" 
shortly. 
  The most touching moment of the evening was when Aleksandr 
Nevzorov was given some flowers: A boy sent by some adult ran 
up onto the weight-lifting podium and over to the soiree 
presidium rostrum and spent a long time wondering to whom to 
give the bouquet. "Whose boy is this?" Aleksandr Prokhanov 
asked over the microphone and affectionately beckoned the boy 
over. The kid took a long time to leave the stage, amid the 
friendly laughter of the free agents in the room. Albert 
Makashov went up to the microphone right after the boy and was 
introduced by Aleksandr Prokhanov with a riddle: "Who ran 
through the White House on foot in a black beret like a wolf 
from the first to the 13th floor?" Gen. Makashov angrily asked 
God to clear the country of prostitutes and the mafia, or else 
he and his comrades would do it themselves "if you do not have 
the time, God"; he also promised to hand over his shoulder 
boards to anyone who would unite them [sentence as published]. 
It was probably for the special benefit of those people 
gathered at Izmaylovo that evening who thought about uniting all 
the readers of Prokhanov's newspaper in the future and obtaining 
Gen. Makashov's shoulder boards that the following books were 
sold in the foyer: "Mein Kampf," Zyuganov's memoirs, and a 
political biography of Rutskoy, alongside cassettes of ponderous 
German Army marches. 
  "All Russia is in the mire" -- that was the beginning of a 
poem by General Titov, the most peaceable of all the generals at 
the soiree. "I must live in peace and harmony," Mikhail 
Georgiyevich continued, and gave the following reason: "I 
belong to the heroic generation that stopped fascism." And he 
asked the free agents to consider Prokhanov the people's editor 
of what is indeed a people's newspaper and Boris Yeltsin as 
Russia's first and last president, stipulating however for the 
press that he personally favors the peaceful way of resolving 
the problem. 
  A soiree that should have demonstrated the unity of the 
whole 
opposition nonetheless left observers with plenty of questions: 
General Sterligov, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Viktor Aksyuchits's 
Christian Democrats, Vasilyev's "Pamyat," Astafyev's Christian 
Democrats, and many others did not want to subscribe to Russia's 
unity. And Aleksandr Rutskoy himself, as a representative of 
his party courteously told your IZVESTIYA correspondent, was the 
only official delegate from the Free Russia People's Party. So 
Gen. Makashov can rest easy over his shoulder boards.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "Prosecutor's Office To Check Legality of </F>
Opposition Leaders' Speeches"] 
  [Text] The Russian General Prosecutor's Office has 
instructed Moscow Prosecutor Gennadiy Ponomarev to investigate 
illegal actions which took place in the capital 9 May 1994 
during a rally in Lubyanka Square. 
  INTERFAX was told at the General Prosecutor's Office that G. 
Ponomarev has been instructed to carry out an investigation and 
make the appropriate legal assessment of the case of the public 
burning of the Russian Federation state flag, of the calls from 
the rally speakers for a struggle to "destroy the existing 
regime," of the abusive attacks on top state officials, and of 
the anti-Semitic slogans and banners. 
  The rally in Lubyanka Square was organized by a number of 
opposition parties and movements. In particular, it was 
addressed by former Russian Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy and 
National Salvation Front leader Ilya Konstantinov, who both 
spent around six months in jail on the charge of organizing the 
mass riots in Moscow 3-4 October 1993. In his speech Rutskoy 
called for the 50th anniversary of the victory over fascism in 
1995 to be marked by a "victory over this antipeople regime." 
  A statement from the General Prosecutor's Office notes that 
the Prosecutor's Office is attentively following the development 
of the situation and warning that "full use will be made of the 
powers granted it under the law to put a stop to 
unconstitutional actions by both individuals and associations of 
citizens aimed at destabilizing the situation in society."

  [Text] Moscow May 16 TASS -- Former Soviet President 
Mikhail Gorbachev has no chances to become the Russian president 
as people do not support him, according to an influential 
lawmaker. 
  "Statements by Mikhail Gorbachev about his possible 
participation in presidential elections in 1996 are completely 
groundless. He has no social basis", Viktor Mironov, deputy 
chairman of the Duma Committee on Security told TASS on Monday. 
  "With all my respect to the former Soviet president, I 
believe he has exhausted his resources of a head of state", he 
added.

  [Text] Yaroslavl May 15 TASS -- Russian nationalist leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy promised on Sunday to solve all economic, 
social and criminal problems facing Russia, provided the 
would-be victory of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) enables 
him to form a one-party cabinet. 
  Speaking to residents of the ancient Russian city of 
Yaroslavl in the overcrowded hall of local cultural centre at 
what he called a regional conference of the LDPR, Zhirinovskiy 
reiterated that only his party is capable of leading Russia of 
the crisis [sentence as received]. He criticised severely 
Communists and Liberals, called them "weak teams" but said all 
disputes should be solved peacefully, through elections. 
  In the field of economy, Zhirinovskiy said, his party 
advocates a combination of socialism and capitalism. He called 
to impose a tax maximum at the rate of 40 per cent, to curb the 
conversion of defence industries, and to halt ruining the state 
sector in industry and agriculture. 
  Zhirinovskiy did not support the idea of restoring the 
Soviet 
Union but said that if the former Soviet republics have to pay 
their debts in full, they will volunteer to rejoin Russia 
themselves. 
  Paying tribute to his usual eccentricity, Zhirinovskiy 
promised to sack the local authorities for inadequate treatment. 
The Yaroslavl administration decided against red-carpet 
reception of the notorious politician limiting its services to 
providing premises for his performance and ensuring his security.

  [Text] St. Petersburg May 14 TASS -- "Our main objective is 
to pool the efforts of Christian Democrats of the world in 
combatting the nuclear danger," Vice President of the 
International Christian Democrats Andre Louis said in his 
message of greetings to participants in the fourth international 
congress "Christian Democracy Today" which opened here today. 
  According to the vice president, North Korea's reluctance to 
join the nonproliferation movement is one such danger. The 
Christian Democratic International has always aimed and 
continues to aim to make the treaty on the renunciation of 
possession, testing and use of nuclear weapons in definite and 
encourage as many countries as possible to join it. 
  The congress, which is being attended by delegates from 18 
countries of Europe, Asia and Africa, will discuss, during its 
three days of work, problems of dialogue between different 
denominations of Christianity, Buddhism and Islam, plans for the 
expansion of activity of Christian Democrats in African and 
Commonwealth countries and specify the conceptual framework for 
the development of the organisation after the disintegration of 
the socialist camp in Eastern Europe.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz, 15 May -- Direct contacts and talks 
between the peoples of North Ossetia and Ingushetia themselves 
could become a principle factor stabilizing the situation in the 
area under the emergency situation. This is what Shmidt 
Dzoblayev and Oleg Novikov, members of the Russian president's 
public chamber told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today after their 
visit to the area under the emergency situation in North Ossetia 
and Ingushetia. 
  The members of the public chamber under the Russian 
president 
and heads of the two republics agreed on cooperating more 
closely to settle the conflict between Ossetia and Ingushetia. 
In particular, Shmidt Dzoblayev, who is general secretary of 
the Assembly of Democratic Forces of the Northern Caucasus, 
proposed holding a conference of ethnic leaders in the region in 
the immediate future to reconcile the "brothers" [krovniki]. 
This would create the conditions necessary for the ethnic 
Ingush and the peoples of North Ossetia to be able to live 
together in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Shakhray, deputy chairman of Russian </F>
Government, under the "Politics" rubric: "Northerly Inhabitants 
Must Be Helped in Summer, Not in Winter"] 
  [Text] The disruption of economic ties in parts of the Far 
North and equivalent territories, the sharp reduction in the 
volumes of extraction of raw materials, including oil, and the 
growth in transport tariffs have jeopardized the provision of 
the region's population with vitally important products. Thus, 
to date, compared with the 1993 level, 45 percent of the 
foodstuffs, consumer goods, and petroleum products have been 
shipped in and just 8 percent of the contracts concluded for 
technical industrial output. As of 1 May, 765,000 tonnes of 
freight had accumulated in sea and river ports, although by May 
last year this figure had reached 2 million tonnes. There is 
virtually no freight in Far Eastern ports that is earmarked for 
delivery to the North. The dramatic nature of the situation is 
indicated, for example, by the fact that goods are brought into 
a number of internal regions of the northern territories along 
rivers on which navigation begins in May and continues for 
several weeks. At the same time it should not be forgotten that 
many of the northerners' needs are met in full by means of 
deliveries. Whereas in the eighties they were funded through 
the credit system, this is impossible now. 
  Resolving the problem, the government has adopted a decree 
altering the mechanism of state financial support and shipping 
of output and goods into northern regions. The Federal Fund for 
State Funding of Shipping of Products and Commodities is being 
created as a result of this. It is being formed out of state 
budget funds, which will essentially be the North's annually 
indexed working capital. A special operational commission is 
being set up, which should, in my view, be endowed with 
extraordinary powers. We frequently say that Russia will grow 
by means of the North, but the inhabitants must be given active 
assistance now, so that they do not again encounter the dramatic 
situation in which they found themselves last winter.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Filatov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- "The land code will give a 
fresh impetus to the land reform in Russia," Nikolay Komov, 
chairman of the Russian Committee for Land Resources and Land 
Management, told ITAR-TASS after the draft's discussion by the 
Presidium of the Russian Government. 
  Asked why this code was necessary, Komov mentioned four 
principal reasons: Firstly, the number of parties to land 
relations has lately increased sharply, reaching 60 million 
families. This process is continuing due to the extensive 
development of entrepreneurship, private housing construction, 
increasing number of private farms, development of horticulture, 
vegetable-growing, and subsidiary farming. Secondly, new rights 
to own land have appeared, as well as new legal grounds on which 
citizens and legal persons can obtain land and effect 
transactions with it. Thirdly, one now has to pay for the right 
to acquire land and to use it. And, fourthly, the 
redistribution of land (land circulation) has become much 
faster. A land market has appeared. 
  Komov said that the draft land code includes 21 chapters. 
They reflect the main directions of Russia's land policy, the 
right to own land and other rights, the competence of state 
bodies and local self-government organs in land matters, the 
legal and economic mechanism for dealing with them, the status 
of agricultural, forest, urban, specially protected and other 
lands. Important attention is given to the protection of the 
priceless land wealth, land management, state land evaluation 
and registration of the right to own land plots, and to 
transactions with them. 
  Komov particularly noted that the document includes for the 
first time a chapter on "land transactions", laying down clearly 
the procedures for concluding deals with land plots and land 
shares, obtained during the reorganisation of collective and 
state farms. The proclaimed rights of citizens and legal persons 
are still not legislatively regulated even now that Russia is 
switching over to a market economy. There is no mechanism or 
procedure for obtaining land (for money or free of charge), or 
for renting it on a termless basis. An owner cannot mortgage 
his land, cannot use is as a contribution to some fixed capital, 
cannot present it as a gift or to exchange it. It is 
practically impossible to dispose of a land share at one's own 
discretion, because it is granted only for farming purposes. 
There is also no procedure for buying out land needed by the 
state or the municipal authorities. Today, it is even 
impossible to replenish the land redistribution fund for 
carrying out many state programmes or to confiscate land from 
lazy owners and to transfer or sell it to efficient farmers. 
  In addition to legally guaranteeing the rights of citizens 
and juridical persons to freely own, use and dispose of their 
land in their own interests, the draft code also contains some 
restrictions on land deals, preventing latifundism in Russia. 
  Komov also noted that legal norms for the land around large 
apartment houses have been fixed for the first time. These land 
plots, within the established limits, may be owned jointly by 
the dwellers (in the form of condominiums). 
  The proposed draft land code, Komov believes, allows to 
eliminate the blank spots in the existing legislation and to 
place land relationships on a solid economic basis. It reflects 
the novelty and complexity of the land situation in Russia. At 
the same time, the document is understandable and convenient not 
only for specialists, but for all the citizens of the country. 
  After discussing the draft, the Presidium of the Russian 
Government instructed corresponding bodies to make the necessary 
amendments in it and to submit the document to the State Duma 
for approval.

<F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Marina Deykun; from the </F>
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Announcer Sergey Shatunov] According to Israeli 
immigration services, between 200,000 and 500,000 former 
residents of Russia and CIS countries will move to the Promised 
Land before the end of the millennium. Our correspondent 
continues on the same theme. 
  [Deykun] Starting from 1922, foreign exile became a form of 
punishment for crimes in the USSR. It looks as if now 
emigration is becoming a punishment for the state itself. Its 
present wave, the fourth one according to specialist, is 
economic emigration. According to the Labor Ministry figures, 
some 100,000 people leave Russia every year. Most are skilled 
workers, qualified specialists, and artists. The most alarming 
feature is the brain drain from theoretical science and the 
defense complex. After all, Western economies now accept only 
highly qualified migrants. Another alarming feature is that one 
migrant in three takes a child with him/her. This trend is on 
the increase against the backdrop of an already adverse 
demographic situation. 
  Where then do former Russian citizens move to? Mostly, to 
Germany. In the past three years more than one half of emigre's 
from this country have settled there. The United States is 
pursuing a more cautious immigration policy. Between 1991 and 
1993, some 40,000 Russian nationals settled there. Emigration 
to the Promised Land has dropped sharply--probably because, 
according to Israeli sociologists, only eight percent of 
emigrants from the CIS managed to integrate completely into 
society. 
  Studies conducted in this country show that eight percent of 
Russian nationals do not rule out the possibility of leaving for 
good. They are mostly town-dwellers, male, aged between 25 and 
29, graduates. In the past three years, according to official 
figures alone, 300,000 former Russian citizens have bidden 
farewell to their homeland. That amounts to the entire 
population of a city the size of Penza. [video shows street

  [Text] The State Statistics Committee reports that the rate 
of industrial slump in Russia reached almost 25.5 percent during 
January-April. This sets a record for the entire period of 
reform in the country. The biggest decline occurred in sectors 
connected with the chemical and petrochemical industries, light 
industry, and engineering. The fall in production was between 
35 and 45 percent in those sectors. 
  Russia's gross domestic product during the first four months 
of this year fell as a whole by 17 percent, compared with the 
corresponding period last year.

  [Text] According to the National Statistics Committee, in 
January- April the rates of decline in Russian industry made up 
25.4 pct - a record index since the start of reforms in the 
country. 
  In the first quarter of this year the rates of decline were 
less than 25 pct as compared with the same period last year. 
  In April average daily industrial production fell by 3.3 pct 
against its March level. 
  The greatest decrease in the volume of production was noted 
in the industries requiring investment and in consumer-goods 
production. For instance, as compared with the fuel and energy 
industry, where the volume of production in the past 4 months 
fell by 11 pct, in the food industry it decreased by 21 pct, in 
machinebuilding by 45 pct, in chemistry and petrochemistry by 35 
pct, and in the consumer-goods industry by 39 pct. 
  In January-April oil extraction made up 99.3 million tons - 
15 pct less than in the same period last year; gas extraction 
made up 217 billion cubic meters - 1 pct less. 
  The output of tractors fell by four-fifths against the same 
period last year; the output of cars went down by 28 pct and 
that of trucks by 66 pct. 
  High rates of decline were noted in the production of TV 
sets 
(31 pct), in the production of washing machines (45 pct) and in 
the production of other kinds of household equipment. The 
demand for such products fell because of high prices and low - 
as compared with the foreign-made analogues - quality. 
  According to the National Statistics Committee, in the first 
four months of this year Russia's Gross National Product 
decreased by 17 pct against the same period last year, and made 
up 142 trillion rubles. 
  Official statistics also note greater number of plants and 
factories where production was suspended for a long time. In 
January there were 3800 such plants, and over 5000 in April.

percent in April. 
  According to a report on the state of the Russian economy 
prepared by experts from the Economics Ministry, in the first 
quarter of 1994 Russia's industrial output fell more sharply 
than ever. The number of loss-making enterprises more than 
doubled over the period and amounted to 18.6 per cent of all 
industrial enterprises by the end of March. 
  Another trend recorded in the first quarter was more 
promising. According to the RosBusiness Consulting agency, 
release prices in Moscow fell for the first time in April. 
Inflation expectations also fell for the first time.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Rytov report under the "Social View" rubric: </F>
"Emergency Measures Being Taken To Localize Unemployment"] 
  [Text] The destinies of ordinary people once again occupy 
a priority place on the scale of the government's moral values. 
So, how do things stand now with unemployment? 
  According to Russian Federation State Committee for 
Statistics figures, 1,363,600 citizens are registered in Russia 
as not employed in labor activity. This includes 1,083,000 
unemployed. But that is still not the whole story. There is 
so-called hidden unemployment, on a scale estimated by experts 
at 5 million people. It involves, inter alia, working people on 
unpaid leave or on a reduced work regime. 
  As we can see, the figures are striking. Yet they give rise 
to serious doubts. 
  First question. Does the employment sphere take account of 
the number of persons "shuttling" among the regions of Russia 
and to neighboring countries and countries further afield? 
Experts estimate that these people account for one-third of the 
country's trade turnover. So, do they work or do they not? 
They work, and how! But they most likely feature in 
statistical data as being temporarily out of work. 
  Second question. How are we to categorize persons engaged in 
so-called street trading? For example, in addition to 
grandmothers drawing their pensions we meet a lot of prosperous 
young people trading in vodka and cigarettes at every subway 
station in the capital. 
  Third question. According to State Employment Service 
information there are vacancies across the country for 289,400 
people. Why are they not being filled? 
  In short, the problem of unemployment in our country is not 
yet acute. It could become so, however, if mass bankruptcies 
should begin among enterprises. Here tribute must be paid to 
the Cabinet of Ministers, which has finally learned to act 
promptly. 
  On 3 May 1994 the Russian Federation Government adopted the 
decree "On Measures To Ensure the Population's Employment in the 
Event of Critical Situations Arising in the Labor Market in 
Particular Areas of the Russian Federation." 
  What provision does this document make? Above all it 
provides for expert appraisal of the financial state of 
enterprises which dismiss workers en masse. If there is no 
special need for this to happen, the personnel cutback is 
suspended or else carried out in stages. 
  The planned measures conflict with the tough law "On the 
Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises." The government has 
therefore suggested that all interested ministries and 
departments submit proposals for amending and supplementing this 
law. 
  I expect such amendments to be received in good time and to 
be approved in the legislature.

  [Text] Russia's trade turnover with countries outside 
former Soviet territory from January to April amounted to 18.1 
billion dollars, having gone down by 5.2 pct, according to the 
State Committee for Statistics. 
  While exports rose by 6 pct, imports fell by 23 pct, the 
positive balance consequently increasing to 6.9 billion dlrs, as 
compared to 4.5 billion a year ago, the committee said. 
  Exports of crude oil reached 26.8 million tonnes, or 9 pct 
up 
on the same period last year, those of natural gas 38 billion 
cubic meters (15 pct up), those of oil products 9.5 million 
tonnes (14 pct up), those of mineral fertilizers 3.6 million 
tonnes (11 pct up), and those of pig iron 828,000 tonnes (61 pct 
up). At the same time exports of machinery and equipment 
dropped by 23 pct. 
  In the first four months of 1994, Russia exported to 
countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States 8.7 million 
tonnes of oil, or half as much as in the same period in 1993, 
and 26.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas, or 3 percent down. 
  Russia imported from January to April 417,000 tonnes of 
grain, or one-tenth of the amount of the first four months of 
last year, half as much meat, and two-thirds as much white 
sugar, though imports of meat, poultry, tea, butter and 
furniture went up, the committee said.

  [Text] Moscow May 16 TASS -- Production decline continues 
in the Russian agroindustrial complex. In the first quarter of 
the year the production of major agricultural products dropped 
by 18 per cent over the same period last year, the Ministry of 
Economics told BUSINESS-TASS on Monday. 
  At the same time, the Ministry said that the acreage of 
farmland sowed with crops has increased dramatically this year. 
  As of the beginning of April, farms had 660,000 tonnes of 
diesel fuel and 313,000 tones of gasoline (52 and 61 per cent of 
the last year level respectively). About 300,000 tractors, or 
32 per cent of the total, are out of order. 
  The processing of sugar beat was practically completed in 
the 
first quarter of the year. A total of 108,000 tonnes of sugar 
was produced, a 26,000 tonne decrease since last year. Russian 
sugar refineries produced 235,000 tonnes, or 60 per cent of the 
last year level, of sugar from imported raw sugar. One more 
million raw sugar was purchased in Cuba. 
  Meat production decreased by 25 per cent over the same 
period, sausages by two per cent, butter by 67 per cent, milk 
products by 83 per cent. The production of cheese increased by 
104 per cent. 
  The production of flour dropped by 16 per cent from four 
million at the end of 1993 to 3.2 million tonnes, cereals by 35 
per cent, reaching 298,000 tonnes.

<F P=106> [Ivan Zhagel report: "$8 Billion Frozen by Soviet </F>
Authorities Starting To Be Returned to Russian Enterprises"] 
  [Excerpts] IZVESTIYA has been told by Mikhail Fedorov, 
chief of the Vneshekonombank [Bank for Foreign Economic 
Activity] Domestic Hard-Currency Debt Servicing Administration, 
that as of 14 May -- or, in practice, owing to the weekend, as 
of 16 May -- the 1993 state foreign currency bonds have started 
to be redeemed and to have interest paid on them. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to M. Fedorov, the total value of the first 
tranche 
of bonds is $266 million. Moreover, another $250 million will 
be paid out in the form of interest on all five bond issues. 
Under the terms of the placing of these securities, the period 
for presentation of the bonds for repayment is set at 10 years 
-- in other words, until 2005. So those who are unable to 
obtain their money immediately after 16 May will be able to do 
so in the next few days -- there is plenty of time. 
  Naturally, bond-holders will be trying to redeem the bonds 
and gain their interest in the first few days. Here a question 
arises -- will they not be hampered by all kinds of technical 
shortcomings? But, M. Fedorov assured us, the Vneshekonombank 
has already received from the government all the foreign 
exchange required and has transferred it to its 23 authorized 
banks, with branches throughout the country. There should be no 
problem in redeeming the foreign currency bonds. 
  Nonetheless, it should be borne in mind that the first 
tranche of bonds are held by only a few lucky people. They were 
mainly placed with commercial banks, joint ventures, and 
charitable foundations. State enterprises -- or what had until 
recently been state enterprises -- as a rule received the fourth 
and fifth tranches of foreign currency bonds. And they may 
simply not survive until redemption -- in other words, they 
could go bankrupt. 
  Admittedly, an aftermarket in state foreign currency bonds 
is 
already taking shape. And those enterprises which need the 
money immediately -- for restructuring, say, or to pay their 
debts -- can sell their securities. But, naturally, for far 
less than they are worth. 
  Thus, according to specialist assessments, the second 
tranche 
of the securities currently stand at 62 percent of par in the 
aftermarket, the third tranche is trading at 42 percent, the 
fourth tranche at 31 percent, and, finally, the fifth tranche is 
trading at 26 percent of its par value. Of course, many 
enterprises see this as robbery -- and not by those purchasing 
the bonds, but by the state. 
  Nonetheless, to be fair, it should be said that the blame 
for 
this hardly lies with the current Russian Government. It is 
paying up for other people's debts, even though it has assumed 
them itself. Moreover, the fact that under the current complex 
conditions the government has clearly honored its obligations 
under the first tranche of the foreign currency bonds even as 
regards the payment of interest will undoubtedly strengthen 
confidence in other state securities and have a positive affect 
on the financial situation as a whole. 
  Incidentally, many specialists were forecasting on the eve 
of 
the scheduled payments that the bond redemptions could 
destabilize the foreign exchange market and lead to an uneven 
fall in the ruble. But, as is not hard to calculate, all of the 
first tranche together with the interest on all the other 
tranches comes to around $500 million. This is not such a big 
sum -- it is comparable to the size of just a week's trading on 
the Moscow Interbank Foreign Exchange Market.

<F P=106> [Feature comprising unattributed report "based on data from </F>
the Russian Federation Government Economic Conditions Center," 
plus editorial commentary: "26 April-4 May: The Week's Prices. 
A Market Is a Market"] 
  [Text] According to the latest data from the weekly 
monitoring of prices by state statistics organs, the overall 
inflation index for the past week stood at 102.2 percent, and at 
160 percent for the period since the beginning of the year. 
Prices of food products rose by 1.9 percent, and prices of 
other products by 2.3 percent; the price of paid public services 
rose by 3.8 percent. 
  The largest price increases for basic consumer goods and 
paid 
services -- 5.7 percent -- were recorded in the Ural region, 
where the largest increases in Russia were recorded for nonfood 
goods -- 6 percent -- and paid services: 36 percent. 
  At the beginning of May the prices of basic food products 
were 1.1 percent up on the end of April in organized trade and 
5.4 percent up in nonorganized trade. The largest increases 
were for products sold in the city markets, where fruit prices 
increased by 10.8 percent in the week, prices of groats and 
pasta by 7.6 percent, vegetable prices by 5.6 percent, and 
prices of meat products by 5.1 percent. In all regions prices 
during the holidays and the days leading up to them rose most of 
all for meat products -- by 4-6 percent -- and also fruit and 
vegetables -- by 4-14 percent, mainly as a result of increases 
in the city and informal markets. Only prices of vegetable oil 
and vodka remained unchanged, in both the stores and the markets. 
  The average cost of a basket of the 19 most important 
products on 4 May was 48,500 rubles [R], a 60-percent increase 
in the period since the beginning of the year. The cost of this 
basket at organized trade prices was R46,500, and at market 
prices R59,700. 
  The lowest cost of the basket was again recorded in the 
Volga 
region -- R38,200. The "dearest" region for the cost of the 
basket remains the Far East region -- R83,000. 
  Among the list of nonfood goods, fuel prices continued to 
increase at an accelerated rate -- more than 10 percent in the 
course of the week. Among other goods the most notable price 
increases were for nitroglycerine (4.5 percent), wallpaper once 
again (3.7 percent), and matches (3.2 percent). Prices of 
tobacco products were virtually unchanged. 
  The largest price increases were in the Ural region -- 6 
percent. This change in the average prices in the region over 
the week was the result of increases of more than 10 percent on 
fuel, and also children's clothing and footwear. 
  There remains a significant gap between the minimum and the 
maximum prices of identical goods in different Russian cities. 
Thus during the whole of April and at the beginning of May the 
difference in prices of analgin [type of painkiller] was 1,200 
percent and of cotton fabrics around 500 percent. 
<H5>  Our Commentary </H5>
  Readers are anxious to know what products make up the basket 
of 19 goods. Obviously this is no idle question; it is prompted 
by a desire to know what average prices the analysis is based 
upon, and whether the basket corresponds to people's real needs. 
  We publish the list of average prices for 4 May. The prices, 
as you can see, are very close to the real ones. In Moscow 
(which is the 34th most expensive city), at least, prices of 
some products -- particularly granulated sugar (R560-R580), eggs 
(R650-R1,000), and raw materials (from R4,800) -- were even a 
little lower. 
  As for the nutritional norm, let us once again stipulate: 
This list, in the form in which it is published, can in no way 
be considered a biological norm recommended by medics. This 
indicator is taken by economists in order to trace the change in 
the inflation level in the country. And although it initially 
contains a sensible starting point for the nutrition of a 
healthy male, nevertheless, you won't be able to determine 
whether the state statisticians' approaches to assessing our 
economic situation are right just by the simple addition of the 
figures. This is demonstrated by the round figures for weight: 
It appears that in the course of a month an adult consumes a 
total of exactly one kilogram, and smokes one packet of filter 
cigarettes. This is nonsense. So here is the list -- but do 
not be hasty with your conclusions.

  [Text] Vladivostok May 17 -- The commander of the Russian 
Pacific Fleet, Admiral Georgiy Gurinov has been released of the 
post, informed sources told ITAR-TASS. Vice-Admiral Igor 
Khmelnov is now acting commander of the fleet. 
  Observers say Admiral Gurinov's sacking is due to a sharp 
drop in the fleet's combat capability. At a recent press 
conference in Moscow, Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said the 
Pacific fleet ranks last in the Russian armed forces as regards 
its degree of battle capability and the command of the fleet 
needs reshuffling. 
  Observers also point out that Admiral Gurinov was not 
personally involved in the clean-up operation after the May 14 
blast at the fleet's ammunition dump in Nezhino. He was also 
notably absent from the welcoming ceremony for the Chinese 
warships which arrived for a visit to Vladivostok on Tuesday. 
  According to official information, the admiral is feeling 
unwell.

  [Text] Izhevsk May 16 TASS -- "The state will fulfill its 
commitments to the defence industry," said First Vice-Premier 
Oleg Soskovets during his visit to the "Izhmash" plant today. 
"After the budget is endorsed, in the near future this might 
become a reality," he said. 
  According to Soskovets, the state intends to boost the 
development of more advanced technologies for the armed forces 
and advocate a liberal approach to the realisation of military 
exports. Soskovets pointed out that exporting weapons, the 
government will take into account political interests of the 
state, and the liberalisation of exports will be beneficial for 
manufacturers. 
  Soskovets pointed out that the government will offer defence 
enterprises an opportunity to independently work for exports. 
"However, the state does not intend to sell a number of military 
hardware constructed on the basis of absolutely new high tech, 
which affects the country's defence," Soskovets said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunayskiy] </F>
  [Summary] Moscow, 14 May -- Russia's Chief Military 
Procuracy [CMP] intends to ask the presidential administration 
to speed up the creation of a military police in Russia's Armed 
Forces. The necessary documents have already been submitted. 
  It was noted at a recent working conference of the CMP that 
crime has risen sharply in the forces -- 2,572 people were 
killed and 1,002 received injuries in the armed forces in 1993; 
while 2,868 weapons were stolen in the same period. The 
existing preliminary investigation bodies, consisting of unit 
commanders and locally appointed officers, are considered 
inadequate. Last year the number of crimes concealed for 
various reasons by these non-professional bodies rose by a 
factor of 2.2 compared to 1992.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 16 TASS -- A many-day action of protest 
against peace-time deaths in the Army, initiated by activists of 
the "Russia's Mothers of Soldiers" movement, began in downtown 
Moscow on Monday. The movement demands investigation into the 
cases of murder in the Army, cancellation of the universal 
military service, and adoption of a law on the status of 
soldiers' mothers, Lyubov Lymar, leader of the movement, told 
ITAR-TASS. 
  She believes the state should help the families which have 
lost the breadwinners. The state should guarantee insurance and 
other benefits for the parents and under-age children of the 
servicemen who died in peace time, she said. 
  Lymar said that if the demands were not met, the movement 
activists would picket the office of the procurator-general, 
headquarters of the Federal Assembly, the government and the 
Defence Ministry. 
  The activists are planning to meet representatives of the 
office of the Russian procurator-general on Monday and State 
Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin on May 21. On Sunday, the activists 
met Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov who promised help in rendering 
assistance in Moscow to the parents and families who lost sons 
in the Army. 
  During the three years of its activities, the movement has 
held more than ten protest actions, including a two-week hunger 
strike, pickets of government offices, a march of protest along 
Moscow's streets. During one of the actions, the activists 
collected more than 50 thousand signatures in support of the 
movement. Representatives from the Russian Union for Social 
Protection of Servicemen, the Public Association of Servicemen, 
the Church of the God's Mother participated in some of the 
movement's actions.

Vostok" program] 
  [Text] Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff of 
the Russian Federation Armed Forces stated last Wednesday that, 
Russia was ready to launch the first spaceship from the missile 
complex located in Svobodnyy-18 town, Amursk Oblast in 1996; and 
would carry out manned flights in the future. A spokesman of 
the military space forces of the Ministry of Defense told an 
INTERFAX correspondent that the decision to create a new Russian 
space port in Amur Oblast would probably not be adopted until 
the end of this year. Experts believe that the launch of the 
first Far East spaceship, scheduled for 1996, is quite feasible, 
but this is only a blueprint. Today, the only work conducted in 
Svobodnyy-18 is aimed at maintaining the town's infrastructure 
and keeping the missile complex's existing technical equipment 
in shape. [Video shows shots of streets, buildings in

<F P=106> [From the "Today" newscast: Announcer-read report over </F>
video of the Northern Fleet's nuclear waste dump at Guba 
Andreyeva] 
  [Text] [Tatyana Mitkova over buildings, submarines in 
snowy bay] This is the Northern Fleet's temporary storage 
facility for radioactive waste at Guba Andreyeva. TV 
journalists from Moscow were not admitted. The explanation: 
"It is just an ordinary nuclear waste dump of which there are 
quite a few in Russia." Yet its main danger lies precisely in 
its ordinariness. Especially since people here avoid even 
mentioning the "Andreyevka." But all secrets come out 
eventually, and so.... 
  Instead of the statutory 300 people supposed to ensure the 
burial of spent nuclear fuel rods, only 100 work here. They are 
all military men, but they include a lot of unskilled people. 
Elementary protective clothing is in short supply. Officers are 
letting sailors have their suits. There is not even a 
suggestion of safety equipment. Heroic feats are accomplished 
here if not daily, then once every three months. This is the 
interval at which the freight -- spent fuel rods from reactors 
of nuclear submarines -- is delivered. 
  According to an officer who works at "Andreyevka" the method 
of unloading them corresponds to the pre-revolutionary level of 
metal processing. An officer lies on his back to monitor the 
position of the reactor roof [kryshka reactora]. If it shifts 
even by a millimeter, he shouts "Stop!" Should he make a 
mistake, a thermal explosion would occur, i.e. a situation 
similar to Chernobyl.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kuzmin] </F>
  [Text] Vienna May 18 TASS -- The CSCE nations are actively 
seeking ways to enhance the effectiveness of their peace-making 
efforts, to strengthen confidence and security on the European 
continent. This conclusion is warranted by the CSCE report on 
the results of its work in 1993, released in Vienna today. 
  The document points out that the developments of 1993 had 
occurred against the background of futile efforts to promote 
stability in the region. Bloody wars are still continuing in 
the Balkans, in Transcaucasia and in Tajikistan. There is 
persistent tension in inter-ethnic relations and the danger of 
new conflicts is still imminent. 
  In these conditions the CSCE nations did their best to hold 
various consultations and to promote a dialogue on problems of 
current policy. Their new organ -- the Vienna group of the 
committee of senior CSCE officials -- has held more than thirty 
meetings during the reviewed period. CSCE peace-keeping 
missions have worked in many regions, including former 
Yugoslavia and the former republics of the Soviet Union. Their 
purpose was to help find a lasting, all-embracing political 
settlement for the conflicts, to find a mechanism to facilitate 
negotiations between the conflicting sides. 
  The document specially notes the role of the CSCE high 
commissioner for the affairs of national minorities, who visited 
the Baltic states, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. He has 
submitted several valuable recommendations to guarantee the 
observance of human rights. 
  The report stresses that one of the CSCE most important 
tasks 
is to strengthen cooperation in the sphere of security, to 
control armaments and promote disarmament. 
  "The past year has proved that the CSCE is a living 
organism, 
capable of making an important contribution to the prevention of 
regional conflicts, to the promotion of peace-making measures 
and security on the continent," ITAR-TASS was told by CSCE 
Secretary-General Wilhelm Heink. He noted that in the coming 
period the CSCE nations planned to pay more attention to 
humanitarian aspects of cooperation, to expand their interaction 
in the sphere of preventive diplomacy, to activate relations 
with other international organisations and institutions, 
primarily with the United Nations.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Kovalenko report: "Europeans Expecting Leonid </F>
Kravchuk on Island of Corfu. Boris Yeltsin Has Not Yet Received 
an Invitation"] 
  [Text] Paris -- At the present time there is a lack of 
unity among EU member states regarding partnership agreements 
with Russia and Ukraine, plans for which were examined at a 
foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels. 
  The majority, led by Willy Claes, head of the Belgian 
foreign 
policy department, want Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk to 
sign a partnership agreement at the EU summit meeting scheduled 
for 12-13 June on the Greek island of Corfu. French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe has stated that Paris will oppose the pact 
unless Moscow agrees to restrict its export of nuclear materials. 
  France, Alain Juppe stressed, considers the draft 
partnership 
agreement drawn up last week in Moscow by experts of the EU and 
Russia to be unacceptable. 
  France is worried that cheaper Russian exports will hit its 
supplies of nuclear materials to the EU. In 1993, according to 
Western data, CIS countries sold the EU a total of 3,000 cubic 
tonnes of uranium worth $1 billion -- approximately 25 percent 
of Western Europe's requirements. 
  Signing a simultaneous partnership agreement with Russia and 
Ukraine, the EU believes, will on the one hand help these two 
countries' economies, and on the other hand will lead to a 
reduction in the tension in relations between Moscow and Kiev. 
  Among other things, the partnership agreement envisages the 
elimination of restrictions on Russian exports of steel, 
textiles, automobiles, television sets, radio sets, and vodka, 
and at the same time strengthens guarantees for Western 
investments. 
  In 1992 Russian supplies to the EU (mainly energy sources 
and 
certain metals) totaled $17 billion, or almost one-half of all 
Russia's exports. This is 20 times more than Russia supplies to 
the United States, and almost 10 times what it supplies to Japan. 
  Special attention at the ministers' meeting was devoted to 
the situation in Ukraine. 
  The ministers agreed to help Ukraine resolve the problems 
connected with closing down Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power 
Station. However, Kiev will not receive the $6-8 billion it has 
demanded as compensation for closing down Chernobyl.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Portanskiy report: "Signing of Partnership </F>
Agreement with European Union Probably Being Postponed"] 
  [Text] The signing of a large-scale document between 
Russia and the European Union [EU] -- the Agreement on 
Partnership and Cooperation, which took 18 months to elaborate 
and was already largely completed by the end of last year -- is 
being postponed again and, for the moment, indefinitely. This 
situation emerged in the negotiating process in the past few 
days despite the objective desire of Brussels and Moscow for an 
accord. 
  I would remind you that in Brussels on 9 December President 
Boris Yeltsin and EU leaders signed the "Joint Political 
Declaration on Partnership and Cooperation between the Russian 
Federation and the European Union." The point of this document, 
both sides believed, was that at that moment the Partnership 
Agreement was not completely ready -- a whole series of 
technical points had to be cleared up. So, in order to enshrine 
at a high political level the joint will and readiness to sign 
the main document, the leaders of Russia and the EU decided to 
formulate a declaration of intent which would reflect the main 
points of the Agreement. 
  Without going into the details of the Partnership Agreement 
itself, I should merely like to note that this is the first 
legally significant international document in which Russia is 
regarded not as a state with a centralized economy but as a 
country with an economic system in transition to the market. 
This gives us a whole series of trade advantages, both 
immediate and long-term, and makes it possible to shift our 
relations with the EU countries to the level that exists between 
the EU and the United States or the EU and Japan. 
  However, the aforementioned "technical difficulties" in the 
text of the document consequently developed, contrary to the 
sides' expectations, into difficult obstacles to the signing of 
the Agreement. One of them emerged over the appearance in 
November last year of Yeltsin's well-known edict on Western 
banks; another is connected with the trade in nuclear materials 
and affects the interests of France, an EU member. 
  The optimism shown by Moscow and Brussels last December 
during Yeltsin's visit to Belgium was well founded -- Vice 
Premier Aleksandr Shokhin and Sir Leon Brittan, deputy chairman 
of the EU Commissioner, the chief participants in the talks, had 
managed at that time to find a solution to the tangle of 
contradictions that had developed. This solution is a most 
complex sequence of mutual compromises and concessions in 
various economic sectors where a snag at one level would ruin 
all the rest. 
  At the start of May Shokhin and Brittan met again for the 
same reason -- their previous accord had not worked. The second 
solution seemed to have opened the way if not to the signing of 
the Agreement then at least to its initialing in June. However, 
at the EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels on Monday 
France's Alain Juppe unexpectedly stated that the draft 
Agreement on Partnership with the Russian Federation was 
unacceptable. For the same reason as before: Paris is 
concerned that Russian exports of uranium will harm its trade in 
nuclear materials in the EU. 
  "We are very worried about the recent development of events 
over the agreement with the EU," Georgiy Gabuniya, leader of the 
Russian Government delegation to the talks with the EU on the 
economic section of the Agreement, said in an exclusive 
interview for IZVESTIYA. "The French position puzzles us, to 
put it mildly, because it has no economic foundation. That is 
not simply our objective assessment -- during the talks we did 
not hear one convincing argument from the French in defense of 
their position. And the general fears that Russia might dump its 
uranium in the EU in the future have no concrete substance. 
  "We have already made a concession in the solution that we 
found: If the uranium agreement is completely unacceptable to 
the French, let us live within the old regime which has existed 
since 1989 as part of the previous trade and economic agreement 
between the USSR and the EC, so as to preserve everything that 
has been achieved through the most complex negotiations. But 
even that does not suit Paris. Meanwhile no one has yet 
complained that we are disrupting the market or creating 
complications for Western industry." 
  I would add to what Georgiy Gabuniya said that the uranium 
sector in France is concentrated in the interests of the Cogema 
firm, which employs thousands of people and which in recent 
years has recorded a sharp increase in profits (around $10 
million in 1993). 
  For the time being Paris' position remains really unclear. 
If a purely sectoral interest (uranium) is being pursued here, 
why has that not been backed up with documents? Or is this just 
a pretext for wrecking the whole agreement -- in which case the 
arguments are indeed difficult to formulate. 
  In the present situation Moscow is quite willing to continue 
trying to break the deadlock on this problem. However, the ball 
is now in the court of the EU, with which we are officially 
holding negotiations. Perhaps some light will be shed by the 
expected arrival of French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe in 
Moscow today.

  [Text] Azeri, Armenian, and Karabakh defense chiefs will 
not meet again with their Russian counterpart as the mediator, 
Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy defense 
minister, told Interfax Wednesday. 
  He said that while the Armenian, Karabakh and Russian 
ministers had signed the protocol on stage-wise end of the 
Karabakh war, the Azeri defense chief had not. Kondratyev said 
that Russia would give up its mediation efforts if Baku did not 
sign. 
  Kondratyev, who represented Russia in the talks on 
Nagorno-Karabakh, said that Azeri President Geydar Aliyev was 
discussing with his top aides whether he should sign the 
protocol. Kondratyev also said that Vladimir Kazimirov, the 
Russian president's special envoy, also stayed in the Azeri 
capital. 
  According to Kondratyev, the Azeri Defense Minister 
Mamedrafi 
Mamedov was not received by Aliyev on May 17. Kondratyev 
expressed the hope that Azerbaijan would join the protocol.

  [Text] The CIS Executive Secretariat told Interfax that a 
meeting of experts of CIS foreign ministries in Minsk Wednesday 
failed to develop criteria for dividing up the Soviet merchant 
fleet. 
  Belarusian representatives supported the resolution of the 
issue on the basis of a multilateral agreement. They proposed 
that the chairman of the CIS foreign ministers' council look 
into the possibility of launching consultations on the issue 
with the Baltic states. 
  Russia insisted on the merchant fleet's division bilaterally 
between interested states and the Baltic states. If not 
approved, Russian experts said they would remove the proposal 
from the agenda. 
  Finally, the experts' meeting requested that the foreign 
ministers' council take adequate measures to divide up the 
Soviet merchant fleet.

<F P=106> [Article under the "Viewpoint" rubric by Doctor of Economic </F>
Sciences Gleriy Kuzmich Shirokov and Doctor of Historical 
Sciences Andrey Gennadiyevich Volodin: "The `Eurasian Union': 
Anatomy of the Problem"] 
  [Text] The idea of the "Eurasian Union" has generated 
conflicting responses. According to the national patriots' 
thinking this initiative is a reaction to the deepening crisis 
in the republics of the former USSR and the result of the 
realization by the new regional elites of the futility of their 
chosen socioeconomic and political course. The democrats, on 
the other hand, tend to believe that the projected unification 
takes no account of the fact that there are several 
civilizations existing in the former USSR, of different levels 
of socioeconomic development, and of different types of 
political consciousness and political culture. Between these 
positions -- to repeat Goethe's well-known thesis -- is not the 
truth but a most complex political problem. 
  Why has the idea of the "Eurasian Union" arisen, and how 
realistic is it? It has now become clear that the centrifugal 
tendencies are now giving way to centripetal ones. However, it 
is important to understand the reasons for the alternation of 
centrifugal and centripetal cycles in our history. 
  The processes of disintegration reflected the sharp decline 
in the effectiveness of the archaic "Union" state organism, 
whose structures (institutions) and functions had entered into 
irreconcilable conflict with the development of modern 
industrial society. This lack of correspondence became 
grotesque when viewed against the background of the Union 
leadership's inability to offer a concept (or more precisely a 
strategy) of modernization which was convincing to society as a 
whole and attractive to the republic elites as they sought to 
find a cosy "niche" for themselves in the common "edifice" of 
the Union (the proposals to conclude a new Union Treaty in the 
late eighties). The formation of new regional elites, which had 
infantile notions of the laws of economics and thus made the 
winning of sovereignty a legitimate basis for the ascent to 
power, was accelerated by the elections of 1989-1990. In 
addition, beginning in 1985, the USSR's political system was in 
thrall to internal destabilizing factors because the center was 
taking ever-diminishing account of the "traditional" regional 
elites (the unceremonious removal without adequate replacement 
of such leaders as D. Kunayev, V. Shcherbitskiy, and G. Aliyev, 
whatever the reasons for those actions were). 
  The centrifugal tendencies increased because of the 
inability 
of the state party (the CPSU) to perform the once-customary 
functions of integrating society horizontally (the link between 
various territories and ethnic groups) and vertically (the 
"pyramids" of power which maintained the continuity of 
administration and control of society). Then the ruling party 
effectively lost the function of politically socializing 
ambitious individuals -- the "informal leaders" (these functions 
passed over to the opposition movements, fronts, and nascent 
parties). 
  The idea of the "Eurasian Union" and of the restoration of 
the single area is an attempt to reverse the disintegration 
tendencies and change the direction of our common development. 
Thus it is necessary to see clearly both the merits and the 
dubious aspects of the former union state. On the one hand the 
rigid federal pattern hampered processes which are natural on 
such a vast territory -- the processes of decentralization and 
the increasing stability of a system achieved by means of 
effective components acting on their own initiative. 
Regionalism and separatism encouraged the attempts of the Union 
center to restrict the manifestation of cultural identity by 
ethnic groups. On the other hand, the republics were drawn into 
the division of labor by means of the transfer of resources from 
the more developed to the less developed regions (the theme of 
the "nonclassical Russian empire" in which the "colonies" 
developed at the expense of the "homeland" impresses both the 
democrats and the patriots). Furthermore, the interrepublic 
division of labor stimulated the training of cadres on a modern 
basis -- which promoted the emergence in the republics of a 
contemporary economic and political elite. In present 
conditions the idea of the "Eurasian Union" is an instrument for 
overcoming such consequences of decentralization as the sharp 
worsening of the economic and political situation, 
improvisations in the socioeconomic course (attempts are often 
made to compensate for its effective collapse by surrealistic 
appeals to the "national idea," by accusing the Russian-speaking 
population and the Russian army of aggravating economic and 
ecological problems, and so forth), customs barriers which are 
finally destroying the economies of the republics, the 
introduction of untenable ("soft") currencies, intensified 
migration, and so forth. 
  The implementation of the "Eurasian initiative" must 
presuppose the consideration of two interconnected factors. 
Number one: the realization of the need to recreate a single 
area must occur naturally and spontaneously. Number two: As 
soon as the significance of the "Eurasian Union" idea itself is 
realized, the "Eurasian Union" may then emerge not spontaneously 
but as a result of a conscious countermovement by the former 
republics. The structuring of the new common area takes time, 
great political skill, and tact. It should not be forgotten 
that, for all the burdens and deprivations of the post-Soviet 
period, the idea of an autonomous national existence still 
inspires the vital forces of a certain section of the population 
in the republics, because the formation of the national 
consciousness is still not complete and economic interests are 
often perceived and molded by an elite on the basis of 
ideological values, the main one of which is the "national 
idea." In addition, the restoration of the area which has been 
destroyed may entail significant political and economic losses 
for the new national elites, especially those brought to the 
surface of political life by opposition to the Union center and 
then to the "imperial policy" of Russia. It is not hard to see 
that, given the level of competence that has been achieved, 
these groups could be out of office in the new configuration of 
forces. 
  The restoration of the economic ties which have been 
destroyed is not as simple a task as it may seem. The 
centralized system of control, management, and distribution has 
ceased to exist, and a new mechanism for coordinating the 
interests of the proposed association's components has not yet 
been formed. It is over two years since the disintegration of 
the USSR, and in that time there has been a reorientation of 
foreign economic ties taking place in the republics -- within 
the framework of the former Union as well as outside. (This 
tendency is particularly clear in Russia, which is making 
serious efforts to devise a strategy of import substitution). 
Integration, let us reemphasize, takes time. (Let us recall 
that in West Europe this process has been going on for over 20 
years now). Integration must happen not through coercion but on 
a strictly voluntary basis: The republics must independently 
determine for themselves the configuration and range of the 
powers of "supranational" political and administrative 
structures and then delegate the necessary powers to them. 
  The voluntary unification of the republics of the former 
Union is a model for the common area in the future. What is 
needed now, however, is to prepare a "timetable" for the 
negotiating process which will set down a hierarchy of 
priorities, the sequence of tasks pertaining to integration, and 
the period in which they are to be accomplished. What can be 
done right now is to find a common approach to such tasks as the 
elaboration of a concept of unification, the protection of the 
CIS borders, military organization and development on a modern 
basis, the introduction of common customs regulations and 
tariffs, the restoration of economic ties which take into 
account variations in the level to which the economies have been 
reformed, the standardization of information policy, the 
integration of money circulation, the fight against crime, and 
the coordination of foreign policy and of the pace and general 
thrust of the reforms. In other words, we are talking about a 
confederative formation whose degree of integration will 
gradually rise. 
  The idea of the "Eurasian Union" will become considerably 
more attractive to the republics as the ruling elites come to 
understand the character of the world system, whose laws of 
development are now determined entirely by the international 
competitiveness of national economic systems in the harsh 
conditions of the scientific and technical revolution. Finally, 
let us recall Willy Brandt's words: "History is a dynamic 
process in which nothing remains unchanged."

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 19 -- The nation-wide strike of air 
carriers is in the centre of attention of the Russian national 
newspapers on Thursday. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI say "the demands of the strikers are quite 
fair. The air code for which they have been clamouring for a 
long time sets forth the rules of the games in the aviation on 
which air transportation, the health of passengers and flight 
safety belong. This year Russia has had more major accidents 
than all the other countries of the world put together." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA comments: "The systemless privatisation 
of aviation enterprises is leading to the disruption of the 
existing technological chains and gives rise to a new 
monopolism. There is no clear-cut division of functions between 
the airlines and the airports, security, radio navigation and 
communication services, etc. The financial position of most air 
transport enterprises and organisations is critical and 
unstable." 
  TRUD carried an interview with the leader of the pilots' 
union, Alexander Malinovsky, who said, "We demand not money but 
attention on the part of the government to the problems of the 
industry as a whole. The only profit-makers in the industry are 
the enterprises which fly abroad." Malinovsky stressed that "the 
aviators of the north and the far east are in the most critical 
situation despite the fact that airplanes and helicopters are 
the only means of transport in their regions". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA states that "The Russian pilots fly 
better than strike", as the organisation of their labour actions 
leaves much to be desired. 
  Most newspapers report extensively on the wednesday meeting 
with journalists of Vladimir Shumeyko, the speaker of the Upper 
Chamber of the Russian Parliament. PRAVDA quotes the speaker as 
saying that "in international affairs we should take guidance 
not from ideological cliches but from mutual benefit of 
countries concerned". "This applies to south africa and to 
cuba", the newspaper writes. In this connection, Shumeyko 
praised Fidel Castro's intellectual and political potential. 
Asked about his own political orientation, Shumeyko replies "I 
am a constitutional monarchist," PRAVDA reports. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA highlights Shumeyko's comment on Sergey 
Shakhray's resignation as the minister of nationalities and 
regional policy. "This will by no means affect the state of the 
inter-regional problems," Shumeyko said. "With Yegorov's coming 
to the office, the solution of these problems will probably 
switch from the theoretical phase to a phase of their practical 
resolution". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article suggesting that the 
fate of Sergey Filatov as the presidential chief of staff has 
been decided. "he will leave the post in the next few days. His 
chance of retaining the post is negligible," the newspaper says. 
The newspaper cites a source in the president's staff as saying 
that a decree dismissing filatov has already been signed by the 
president, it remains to fill in the date and the outgoing 
number". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA says that "peace accord on Abkhazia can 
spark 
off internal political clashes. Abkhazian liberation union 
leader Boris Kukubava has turned to the court with a request to 
institute criminal proceedings against Georgian leader Eduard 
Shevardnadze. His appeal says the parliament leader is 
incriminated under article 65 of the georgian criminal code for 
assisting the activity of another state. Russia is implied. If 
this happens, the conflict is abkhazia threatens to re-erupt 
with a new force". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI report that "the governor of Khabarovsk 
proposes the denunciation of an agreement with China". The 
reference is to the agreement on the settlement of the eastern 
stretch of the Russo-Chinese border signed on May 16, 1991. "The 
head of administration of the Khabarovsk territory is 
particularly concerned about articles 5 and 8, which draw the 
border line along navigable rivers and permit vessels of all 
kinds, including military, to sail without any hindrance close 
to the city of Khabarovsk", the newspaper says. 
  TRUD tells the readers about privileges enjoyed by the 
present staff of the Russian federal government. In an 
interview with the newspaper Valery Katunov, who is in charge of 
organizational and technical supplies to the staff, assures the 
readers that "privileges no longer exist".

  [Text] Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko has 
spoken in favor of re-extending the state of emergency in the 
zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict, which comes to an end on 
31 May. Interfax reports that at today's meeting with 
journalists he noted that the settlement of the situation in 
that region will be difficult to achieve without better 
relations with the republic of Chechnya. Vladimir Shumeyko said 
in connection with this that he favored a meeting between Boris 
Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev. According to the chairman of the 
upper chamber, the Federation Council plans to study the 
question of extending the state of emergency in the 
Ossetian-Ingush conflict zone at its regular meeting on 31 May.

  He was supported by Aleksandr Mikhaylov, a representative of

  [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- The State Duma today declined 
to support its ruling council decision to suspend television 
commentator Nikolay Svanidze as requested by the 
Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia angered by his remarks in 
last Friday's television program "Details" broadcast by Russian 
television. 
  One of the party leaders, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, told the 
chamber that his party has repeatedly been the object "of 
aggression from the mass media" and insisted that the program 
author and commentator, Nikolay Svanidze, be suspended until the 
court tries the case. 
  Vengerovskiy's supporters failed to muster enough votes to 
request the leadership of the Russian Television Broadcasting 
Company to act accordingly. 
  The press service of the Liberal-Democratic Party in the 
State Duma circulated a report announcing that "all members of 
the LDPR group of deputies in the State Duma have filed suits in 
the court against Svanidze".

from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] Deputies of the North Ossetian Supreme Soviet 
decided today to agree to the interim administration's request 
for an extension of the state of emergency until 31 July. The 
interim administration is currently the only Russian federal 
authority accepting temporary responsibility for enforcing law 
and order and guaranteeing citizens' security here. 
  The present head of the interim administration is Vladimir 
Lozovoy, who holds the rank of deputy chairman of the Russian 
Government. He was appointed by Russian presidential decree and 
placed in charge of a mixed force of servicemen. He has been 
vested with greater powers than his six predecessors: 
  [Lozovoy] I have been given powers to speed up a solution to 
this conflict, to implement the government's decisions. We must 
engage the main factors -- which are political, legal, and 
socioeconomic. They must be uppermost in securing stability 
here.

<F P=106> [Vadim Nesvizhskiy report from St. Petersburg under the </F>
"Proximity" rubric: "Christian Democrats of all Countries Unite 
in St. Petersburg. The RCDU Has Established Contacts with the 
Russian Proletariat"] 
  [Text] Leaders of Christian Democratic parties (CDP) from 
over 20 countries have opened their congress in St. Petersburg 
under the motto "Christian Democracy Today." According to Andre 
Louis, vice president of the Christian Democratic International, 
its main goal is to "devise a joint strategy of the Christian 
Democrats in a fast changing world." 
  Within the three "post-Soviet" years the Christian Democrats 
have managed to find a niche in the legislatures of many former 
Soviet republics. At the end of 1992, leaders of the Christian 
Democratic Unions [CDU] of Russia and Armenia, and also the NDP 
[expansion unknown] of Georgia announced the creation of the 
East Europe Christian Democratic Union, later joined by the 
Ukrainian Christian Democrats and the Belarusian People's Front. 
At the conference the East Europe CDU applied for collective 
membership in the CDI; to all appearances, they will be admitted 
in the near future. 
  It was decided to continue a dialogue with the Muslims by 
holding the fourth round of talks in Manila between the CDI and 
the RABITA (World Moslem League). At the same time, appeals 
were made to the RABITA, the Roman Catholic, and the Russian 
Orthodox Churches to send their representatives to the former 
Yugoslavia, a move that could help establish religious peace in 
the country. 
  Members of the East Europe CDU agreed to exchange 
parliamentary missions. In the view of Gleb Yakunin, cochairman 
of the Russian Christian Democratic Union [RCDU], the Russian 
Christian Democrats have great chances of success, because "the 
country is leaning toward Christianity." This forecast was 
echoed by Vitaliy Savitskiy, chairman of the State Duma 
organizing committee on relations with religious organizations, 
who said: "The RCDU was the first non-Marxist party to 
establish close contacts with the working movement and the first 
Russian party to forge ties with parties in the former USSR that 
share its views."

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Zaynetdinov: "Look Out, The Osmium Has </F>
Turned `Green'!"] 
  [Text] Two Yekaterinburg dealers were caught red-handed by 
Sverdlovsk Oblast counterintelligence agents, together with 
colleagues fronm the Regional Administration for Organized 
Crime, trying to sell two grams of osmium-192 to a "company 
representative." Aleksandr Grigoryev, press group chief at the 
Sverdlovsk Federal Counterintelligence Service Administration, 
said that the value of the rare isotope was $110,000 
  The dealers were caught handing over the commodity. The 
entire sum was seized. 
  It has not yet been established where the so-called 
businessmen obtained the scarce commodity. But one thing is for 
sure: They were not selling it legally. Right now they stand 
accused under Article 88 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code 
of breaking the rules of currency transactions, since osmium is 
classed as a precious hard-currency commodity. 
  Osmium-192 is used as a catalyst in nuclear reactors. 
According to the counterintelligence agents' information, the 
purchaser was a middleman and the goods were not intended for a 
Russian customer.

<F P=106> ["Rejoinder" by V. Tikhonov, Category I economist in the </F>
Glazunovskiy Rayon Administration Financial Department, Orel 
Oblast, rayon Duma deputy, and member of the Russian Journalists 
Union: "Stroyev Appoints Everyone"] 
  [Text] Orel Oblast -- ...There was an announcement on 
oblast morning radio that Orel Governor Yegor Stroyev had 
confirmed the authority of a number of rayon adminstration heads 
and their combining of their functions with those of chairmen of 
the newly elected rayon dumas. This undoubtedly should have 
been expected in line with the statute on local self-government 
in Orel Oblast for the transitional period. However, 
"appointmentism" on such a scale as we have in our oblast grated 
even on people who have seen a thing or two. A few hours later 
oblast administration spokesman V. Sosunov read out the above 
order at the first session of our rayon duma and announced that 
there would not even be any formal elections of the head of the 
rayon duma. I'll be jiggered! As far as usurping power is 
concerned the oblast administration has even outdone the old 
party organs, which also appointed the leaders of the soviets. 
  However, we must primarily blame ourselves for all that has 
happened. I consider my mistake to have been voting for Ye. 
Stroyev twice in the past -- in the elections for oblast 
administration head and in the Federal Assembly election. A 
party apparatchik with a long service record will hardly be able 
so easily to abandon the old stereotypes in his behavior. 
  Common sense suggests that the people's deputies should meet 
often in order to resolve pressing problems in people's lives 
and carry out voters' instructions. But it is hard to predict 
how the so-called duma chairman, who has been appointed (he is, 
after all, the head of the administration), will like this. So 
it only remains to envy the former rayon soviet of people's 
deputies until a law on local self-government is adopted (unless 
it echoes the Orel instructions).

  [Text] Flight personnel in Khabarovsk did not support the 
appeal of the strike committee to start a strike on May 18. 
  Chief of the Far East Civil Aviation Department Technical 
Service Gennadiy Kobets told INTERFAX that the flight personnel 
of the Khabarovsk Single Aviation Unit would not participate in 
the strike on May 18. He suggested that their decision was due 
to the telegram received from the Russian Air Transport 
Department which considered the strike illegal. Moreover, the 
telegram stated that the demands put forward by the strike 
committee would be discussed by the Russian Labor Ministry on 
May 19. 
  The participation of flight personnel of Kamchatka in the 
general strike is still under question. 
  Kamchatavia Enterprise General Director Nikolay Nedviga told 
INTERFAX that they were following closely the response from 
Moscow and were maintaining contacts with the aviation 
department. A telegram was received stating that an agreement 
had been achieved on practically all aviators' demands. 
However, the issue on pensions, it pointed out, must be decided 
by the legislative bodies. 
  Strikers have insisted on implementation of all their 
demands. This means that the strike is likely to take place and 
Kamchatka air crews will participate in it.

report from Tiraspol: "A Number of Secret Documents Have Been 
Made Public in the Dniester Region"] 
  [Text] On Monday the 14th Russian Army disclosed via the 
local Asket TV network a number of secret documents from the 
archive of the Dniester Region State Security Committee about 
uncontrolled issue of weapons to some deputies of the Supreme 
Soviet and the Tiraspol City Council, and entrepreneurs and 
employees at commercial organizations. This was done "at their 
personal request to Dniester Region President Igor Smirnov." 
Thus, Dniester Region Vice President Aleksandr Karaman owns six 
types of weapons: two automatic rifles, a carbine, a Makarov 
pistol.... 
  Residents of the Dniester region learned from the 14th 
Army's 
TV program that President Igor Smirnov has used public money to 
build a luxury cottage on the premises of the Uzbekistan 
sanatorium in Yalta. 
  The TV program said that government structures in the 
Dniester region have intensified pressure against Tiraspol City 
deputies, the Asket TV studio and also General Aleksandr Lebed 
and army commandant Colonel Mikhail Berdman who in their public 
statements expose abuses by representatives of the upper 
echelons of power in the Dniester region and Tiraspol.

<F P=106> [Lev Ambinder report under the "Economic Reform in </F>
Tatarstan" rubric: "'Unity and Progress' Prepares Agreement 
with the PRES"] 
  [Text] A working group for drawing up a draft agreement on 
joint activity with Sergey Shakhray's Party for Russian Unity 
and Accord [PRES] was set up in Kazan yesterday by the political 
council of Tatarstan's "Unity and Progress" party. Aleksey 
Kolesnik, cochairman of the party and deputy of the republic's 
parliament, has told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that 
the idea of concluding the agreement was discussed with Sergey 
Shakhray back on 26 April at the inauguration of the PRES 
Tatarstan branch. 
  Mr. Kolesnik said in a conversation with your 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the agreement looks certain 
to be based on bilateral, public ("non-state!" -- the "Unity and 
Progress" chairman stressed) control over the implementation of 
the treaty between Tatarstan and Russia. In this regard, 
Aleksey Kolesnik pointed out, KOMMERSANT-DAILY's allegations on 
27 April that his party plans to use the cooperation with PRES 
"to strengthen its position in its standoff with the 
authorities" are completely groundless. In a statement on the 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY publication, the "Unity and Progress" executive 
committee said: "The party has not accused President Mintimer 
Shaymiyev of `dragging his feet on reform and being too careful 
in carrying it out,' because according to our program we are 
interested not so much in speed, but rather in the effectiveness 
of reform. We do not think that confrontation is the best means 
to achieve political objectives. The experience of Tatarstan's 
talks with Russia has shown that only through dialogue can 
positive results be achieved." 
  At the same time, it is evident that a split is emerging 
among the party leaders themselves over approaches to economic 
reform. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already reported that another 
cochairman of the "Unity and Progress" party, its ideologist and 
presidential adviser (now former), Rafael Khakimov, published a 
series of articles in the local press accusing the republic's 
leaders of creating an atmosphere of stagnation in Tatarstan. 
The executive committee of the party's political council 
distanced itself from the "rebellious statements" by Rafael 
Khakimov, calling these publications "his private opinion." 
  However, although "Unity and Progress" leaders keep 
insisting 
that their party is not in opposition to the authorities, the 
government appears to hold a different view. Filza Khamidullin, 
chairman of the Tatarstan State Economy Committee, refused to 
cooperate with party specialists when drawing up a government 
anti- crisis program. 
  For its part, the "Unity and Progress" executive committee, 
familiar only with isolated fragments of the draft anti-crisis 
program being prepared by the State Economy Committee, 
nonetheless sees it as "not sufficiently market-oriented." 
Given that the president has sympathetically reacted to the 
party's economic policy concept and that "Unity and Progress" is 
made up primarily of the republic's city and rayon nomenklatura, 
the State Economy Committee's position appears fairly shaky. 
Mr. Kolesnik explains the current situation as follows: "The 
expressly market-oriented nature of our program and Mr. 
Khamidullin's dogged silence in response to our calls for 
cooperation confirms that someone does not want change but 
wishes to preserve the Tatarstan economy in its current form." 
  Meanwhile, the issue is apparently not only that of 
different 
views on the situation in the republic's economy and further 
economic reform. In the view of observers, a conflict between 
political elites -- the old party nomenklatura currently in 
power and "second-ranking" bureaucrats who have been denied 
access to power -- is deepening in Tatarstan.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Cherkovets: "To the Front Outside the </F>
Pentagon...."] 
  [Text] INTERFAX has reported that Russian Defense Minister 
P. Grachev in a telephone conversation with his U.S. 
counterpart, W. Perry, supported the holding of the scheduled 
joint Russian-U.S. maneuvers at Orenburg Oblast's Totskoye test 
ground. 
  This idea, as we know, has given rise to sharp criticism in 
Russian society. The State Duma has urged President B. Yeltsin 
to abandon the maneuvers and the latter in turn has "suggested" 
to the Defense Ministry that it think about rescheduling them -- 
in the interests of "achieving national accord." But that 
prospect thoroughly displeased the Pentagon, whose high-ranking 
representatives issued a statement in favor of "rehearsing joint 
peacekeeping actions." 
  Meanwhile very curious details became known. The Russian 
side has rejected the return exercise suggested by the Americans 
on their territory: Why inconvenience our host, it said! But 
inconveniencing its own citizens -- that is another matter, it 
can do that. 
  As V. Semenov, commander in chief of the RUssian Ground 
Forces, said in an interview with OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, in response 
to proposals to hold joint exercises on FRG territory the 
Germans refused. Why did their country need such a "gift?" But 
Russia, through its defense minister, is giving the go-ahead to 
a dubious action and counter to assurances that they are seeking 
"accord" the authorities nonetheless intend to ignore the State 
Duma decree, the Orenburg Oblast local authorities' decision, 
and public opinion....

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- The issue of Russia's joining 
the "G-7" economic programme may be raised after the summit 
meeting in Naples, but is not on the current agenda, according 
to presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov. 
  President Boris Yeltsin "is satisfied in principle" with the 
formula which envisages his fully-fledged participation in the 
political discussions at the G-7 summit in Naples, Kostikov told 
reporters on Thursday. 
  As far as the economic part of the discussion is concerned, 
"Russia is not raising the issue about fully-fledged 
participation in (what would be a) G-8", he stressed and added 
that there should be no haste in the issue. 
  "However, it is not ruled out that at the next after Naples 
meeting the issue of a full-scale Russian participation in the 
economic programme of the Big Seven would be raised", he said. 
  He also stressed that Boris Yeltsin is preparing for the 
Naples summit and details will be discussed during his talks 
with the French and British foreign ministers.

<F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko report: "We Are Joining the G-7"] </F>
  [Text] During his recent visit to the FRG Boris Yeltsin 
discussed with Chancellor Helmut Kohl the prospects for the new, 
democratic Russia's integration into the world economy and the 
possibilities of its cooperating with Western industrial states. 
At the same time the head of the German Government stressed that 
Bonn is particularly "in favor of involving Russia as 
extensively as possible in the political section of the G-7 
meeting" and is willing to hold appropriate talks with its 
partners on this. 
  The FRG chancellor's words along with similar statements by 
other world leaders provide unequivocal evidence that, whereas 
the West can still do without Moscow economically, it simply 
cannot resolve many international political problems without it. 
That is why the first real step toward the transformation of 
this elite club has already been taken before our country 
formally accedes to the G-7. A Russian spokesman -- Sergey 
Lavrov, Russian deputy foreign minister -- took part in the 
recent consultations in Rome between the diplomatic departments 
of Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France, 
and Japan on the preparations for the July summit-level meeting 
in Naples. Thus Moscow is for the first time a coauthor of the 
program of work for the world leaders' council and not just a 
"guest of honor." 
  Our interest in participating in the elite club is 
justified. 
The regular G-7 meetings dating back to the mid-seventies 
constitute one of the most important forums for mutual 
consultation on pressing problems of international policy and 
the world economy. And it is quite natural that the former 
"seven plus one" formula, whereby the head of our state only 
joined in the debate at the end of the session once the Western 
countries' joint course had been formulated, could not be 
effective. Russia's participation at the stage where the agenda 
is drawn up is expected to be far more productive. 
  Italy, which is to chair the coming session in Naples, has 
still not announced the range of problems scheduled for 
discussion. But it can be assumed that the question of settling 
the conflicts in Bosnia and the Near East, the role of the 
United Nations and its peacemaking forces in this process, the 
state of affairs in Africa, and the development of the political 
processes in South Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, and other 
parts of the world will top the list. Discussion is also 
expected to turn to the situation in the CIS countries, 
primarily in the hot spots of Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan, 
Georgia, and Abkhazia. 
  As for the meeting's economic program, that will still be 
discussed without Boris Yeltsin's involvement. Nevertheless the 
strategic problems involved in Russia's integration in the world 
economy which Chancellor Kohl mentioned in particular will 
obviously not be ignored. I hope that the Russian president's 
words are heeded when the prospect of affording aid for Russia's 
reforms is considered. The Russian Foreign Ministry believes, 
for instance, that the Naples meeting should discuss the 
question not so much of expanding this aid as of the West's 
meeting its prior commitments and observing the priorities 
formulated with the Russian president's participation at the 
previous meetings in Munich and Tokyo. These being support for 
reforms, the development of privatization and private business, 
an easing of the foreign debt burden, and improved terms for 
Russian goods' access to world markets. 
  Needless to say, one meeting will not be able to drastically 
improve the situation for Russia. But it will reflect the trend 
within the world community and will thus be another "brick" in 
the edifice of good-neighborliness and mutual assistance on our

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- "I think we will succeed in 
talking our Western partner into granting Russia special status 
if it joins the NATO program "Partnership for Peace", Russian 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev told ITAR-TASS after today's 
Cabinet meeting. 
  The Russian defence minister is to fly to Brussels soon to 
take part in the NATO Council session. 
  Grachev said his ministry has prepared specific proposals, 
which have been agreed with the Russian Foreign Ministry and 
will be handed over to the Russian president for approval today. 
If NATO shows interest in the position of Russia, the Russian 
defence minister is prepared to formally present its proposals 
to the members of the North Atlantic Alliance. 
  Grachev stressed however that the main objective of his trip 
to Brussels was not to discuss Partnership for Peace but to 
address the NATO military ministers and other invited defence 
ministers from European and some Commonwealth countries and 
explain Russia's defence doctrine, including the use of nuclear 
arms.

  [Text] Chairman of the Federation Council of the Russian 
parliament Vladimir Shumeyko believes that before joining the 
program Partnership for Peace, it is necessary to see whether 
Russia will lose on its interests and what it stands to gain 
from putting its signature under the document. 
  I believe there is not need to hurry up with the solution of 
the problem, he said in an interview with Interfax. 
  Shumeyko said that jokingly he calls the Partnership for 
Peace program, the "partnership for NATO" program . 
  He favored an immediate creation of CIS peace-keeping 
forces. 
He said that at present about 15,000 Russian military 
servicemen are performing peace-keeping functions in the 
republics of the former Soviet Union, while Russia alone carries 
all the financial burden for them. 
  Shumeyko said that the CSCE and the United Nations are 
unable 
to carry out in the CIS countries serious peace-keeping 
operations due to a shortage of finances.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- "Russia is in no hurry to join 
the Council of Europe, but should not be late either", Russian 
State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin said at a meeting with Miguel 
Martinez, chairman of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the 
Council of Europe, on Thursday. 
  Martinez, in his turn, said he would like to see Russia as a 
fully-fledged member of the Council and added that only a few 
countries still doubt the necessity. He drew Rybkin's attention 
in this connection to the position of Poland and the Baltic 
states. 
  Rybkin assured his guest that Russia would withdraw its 
troops from Germany and the Baltic states "on time".

  [Text] Moscow 19 May ITAR-TASS -- French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe arrived in Moscow today on his first visit to 
Russia. Juppe's goal is to get a better idea of the fundamental 
economic transformations which are taking place in Russia, to 
give a push to the development of bilateral cooperation between 
Paris and Moscow, and to improve the effectiveness of the two 
countries' cooperation in resolving international problems. 
  "Contacts between the French and Russian leaders are 
maintained regularly. They have already become a good 
tradition, reinforced by the 1992 Russian-French agreement", the 
foreign minister told ITAR-TASS before his departure. "Russia 
is one of the world's great powers and is rich in cultural 
traditions and in her ability to renew herself, which is most of 
all thanks to, I am convinced, the Russian people". 
  Juppe's itinerary for his three-day visit is extremely 
packed, including meetings and talks with Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin, leaders in the government and parliament, Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev, and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
The top priority in the talks will belong to questions of 
economic and political mutual cooperation, including along the 
Russia-European Union and "Big Seven" lines. The two sides will 
also exchange opinions on ways to attract more French capital 
into the Russian economy. 
  Among international problems, the French diplomat intends to 
discuss with his Russian colleagues the Bosnian crisis, the 
strengthening of European security through the realization of 
the NATO "Partnership for Peace" programme, the upcoming 
international conference in Paris for the signing of the pact on 
stability in Europe, and the state of affairs in the CIS "hot 
spots" and their surrounding regions. 
  The foreign minister's unofficial activities will include 
visits to Nizhniy Novgorod and St. Petersburg, a city which he 
has wanted to visit for a long time.

  [Text] Ukraine's statement that it is ready to pass its 
strategic bombers to Russia is yet another gimmick aimed at 
creating a wrong impression of the talks on the issue, commander 
of the Russian Air Force, Colonel-General Petr Deynekin told 
Interfax on Wednesday. 
  He said that if Ukraine did not pass its strategic bombers 
to 
Russia on acceptable terms this year, they would simply turn 
into scrap metal. He also noted that even now many of these 
planes would hardly be able to take off and that all of the 
maintenance facilities were located in Russia. 
  He said he did not know anything about forthcoming talks 
with 
Ukraine on the transfer of the bombers to Russia. He also noted 
that Russia and Ukraine had not yet come to terms on the sum 
which Russia is to pay for the bombers. 
  He said that the 8 billion dollars claimed by Ukraine was 
unacceptable. Russia is ready to write off 217 billion rubles 
from the Ukrainian debt for the Russian energy and fuel in 
exchange for the bombers, he stated. 
  Ukraine has 42 heavy strategic bombers.

"To Moscow from Kaliningrad... Over Neutral Waters. We Shall 
Have To Sustain Huge Expenses Unless Regulations Are Drafted for 
Using the Air Space Between Russia and Lithuania"] 
  [Text] Today the skies over Kalinigrad Oblast (Russian 
Federation) are legally controlled by a neighboring state -- 
Lithuania. More specifically, the Vilnyus Regional Air Traffic 
Control Center. The working of Russian aircraft here fully 
depends on the mood of foreign specialists or rather political 
ambitions. Ways of resolving this problem were discussed at a 
meeting between Petr Shirshov, chairman of the Russian Federal 
Assembly's Security and Defense Committee, and Yuriy Matochkin, 
chief of the Kaliningrad Oblast administration. 
  "Two years ago," Lt.-Gen. Vasiliy Proskurin, commander of 
the 
Baltic Fleet's Air Force said, "an interim agreement was 
prepared between Russia and Lithuania on using the air space in 
the region. It established procedures for aircraft passage from 
the oblast's territory to Russia. But for reasons I am not 
aware of it was not signed...." 
  The effects were immediately felt by Navy, Air Defense and 
Border Guard pilots. An air "barrier" prevented their crossing 
Lithuania's territory. It came to the point that one day the 
Vilnyus Regional Air Traffic Control Center denied entry to the 
Russian defense minister's plane. Now military aircraft, taking 
off in Kaliningrad, fly over the sea to Liepaya and Riga and 
then on to Moscow. 
  "We shall have to fly," Proskurin said, "over neutral waters 
via the Gulf of Finland to St. Petersburg. This is quite a 
detour and it will be expensive but there is no other answer so 
far...."

  [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed concern over 
reports about the arrest by Uzbek police of activists of the 
Uzbek Popular Movement Birlik who were to attend an 
international human rights conference in Alma-Ata [Almaty]. It 
was organized by the Russian-American Human Rights Bureau. This 
was stated at a briefing in Moscow on Tuesday by official 
representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Grigoriy Karasin. 
  He noted the fact that one of the detained Uzbek activists 
was arrested on Kazakh territory. At the same time in Tashkent 
Uzbek interior bodies arrested one of the leaders of the human 
rights society and the chairman of the Association of Free Women 
also invited to the conference. 
  "There is an impression that measures were taken to prevent 
Uzbek human rights activists from attending the conference. 
Russia proceeds from the fact that activities of human rights 
organizations are a necessary condition for the functioning of 
any democratic society. Russia will strictly adhere to this 
principle in relations with all states, including the CIS," 
Karasin said. In his opinion, if information about the arrest 
of the human rights activists is true, it is necessary to 
clarify to what extent actions of the Uzbek authorities comply 
with the Charter and the Declaration on Human Rights of the CIS, 
as well as corresponding documents of the UN and CSCE.

  [Text] The State Duma delegation holding talks in the 
Chinese capital represented virtually the entire political 
spectrum of the Russian parliament. As we know, deputies have 
very differing views on reform in this country. They evaluate 
in different ways the possibility of applying Chinese experience 
in Russian conditions and of reaching a solution to border 
problems. Nevertheless, at meetings with the Chinese leaders, 
the deputies appeared to display a united front, confirming that 
China continues to be one of the priorities in Russian foreign 
policy. 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Ivan Rybkin, head of the 
Russian delegation, also agreed that economic changes must be 
based on concrete conditions in each state. But stability in 
society is an indispensable prerequisite for any reform. At the 
meetings both sides recalled the longstanding friendship between 
the peoples of Russia and China and the lengthy frontier which 
they share. But this is no longer enough for the effective 
development of bilateral cooperation. As Ivan Rybkin put it, 
the Chinese leaders took note of specific proposals to change 
the situation. These will be discussed in detail at the 
upcoming meeting of the Russo-Chinese commission on trade and 
economic cooperation and during the visit to China by Russian 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.

  [Excerpt] Beijing, 18 May -- A visit to China by a Russian 
parliamentary delegation led by Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the 
State Duma, ended today. The legislators from the Russian 
Federation made their last stop on the way from Beijing to 
Moscow at the Shenzhen free economic zone in the south of the 
country, which is always being called "the experimental 
laboratory of the Chinese reforms and openness policy." 
  The visit, which took place at the invitation of the 
Standing 
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, has been 
successful, Ivan Rybkin said before leaving Shenzhen by air. In 
an interview with this ITAR-TASS correspondent he noted that 
careful familiarization with the situation in China would 
certainly help Russians be more attentive to the experience of 
their great neighbor and "to adjust their approach to reforms." 
  For example, he explained, Russia is interested in the 
working of the Shenzhen legislators, who have been granted by 
the "superior body" -- the country's parliament -- the right to 
draw up and pass acts of legislation independently. Of no less 
importance is the legislation itself, thanks to which China has, 
in the reform years, attracted to the zone foreign investment to 
the tune of $14,400 million. This topic, as well as bilateral 
economic cooperation, will be discussed during the forthcoming 
visit to China by Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian 
Federation Government. 
  In the words of Ivan Rybkin, an understanding has been 
reached with the leadership of the free economic zone concerning 
a visit by a group of Russian members of parliament to Shenzhen 
through the channels of "people's diplomacy," and also on 
sending some of our industrialists, business people, and bankers 
there "to enhance their qualifications." 
  "There is no doubt about the desire of the Chinese side to 
develop mutually profitable cooperation with Russia, and the 
friendliness of the officials who received us was sincere," he 
assured journalists. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow, 18 May -- I am very satisfied with my visit 
to this splendid country, Argentinian Foreign Minister Guido Di 
Tella stated. Russia has never before enjoyed such respect, has 
never before evoked such sympathy in the world as it does today, 
he stressed in an interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  Touching on the talks held in Moscow, the minister reported 
that an exchange of visits was discussed, in particular a trip 
to Moscow by Argentinian President Carlos Menem at the end of 
October this year. It is expected that documents on investment 
guarantees will be signed during his visit, and a mechanism for 
mutual credits will also be discussed at last, Di Tella reported 
to journalists after making a speech at the Diplomtic Academy of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry. We very much want to have close 
relations with the new Russia, he stressed. 
  Yesterday the Argentinian minister met Mikhail Mityukov, 
first deputy chairman of the State Duma, and Vladimir Shumeyko, 
chairman of the Federation Council. An exchange of opinions on 
the two countries' home and foreign policy took place. 
  The same day, the secretary for foreign economic relations 
of 
the Foreign Ministry of Argentina, who is accompanying Di Tella, 
met Arkadiy Volskiy, head of the Russian Union of Industrialists 
and Entrepreneurs. During the conversation the crisis situation 
in the Russian economy and the shortage of currency resources 
were discussed. The sides agreed on setting up a a system of 
compensation in bilateral trade. The day before that the South 
American businessmen were received at the Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations. 
  The Argentinian entrepreneurs were very satisfied with the 
meetings held here since they saw Russia's enormous 
opportunities, Di Tella said today. Russia is and will remain a 
great world power, and the changes that are happening here are 
opening up huge prospects for its cooperation with all countries 
throughout the world, including Argentina, he stressed. 
  This evening the Argentinian minister is leaving Moscow for 
home.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 19 May (ITAR-TASS) -- A terrorist attack 
against Russian citizens took place in Algeria yesterday. As a 
result three people died and five were injured, said Grigoriy 
Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's information 
and press department, at a briefing today. He named the dead as 
Baturin, Petkevich, and Chenchikov. 
  According to him, a bus carrying 25 Russian citizens was 
travelling from the town of Jijel to the airport in the 
country's capital. Near the village of Ziam the bus was 
attacked. Eleven servicemen of the Algerian army who were 
guarding the convoy of Russian specialists died in the fight. 
G. Karasin said that the terrorists sustained heavy losses. 
  Viktor Posuvalyuk, director of the Near East and North 
Africa 
department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, had a meeting today 
with the ambassador of the Democratic and Popular Republic of 
Algeria in Moscow. He raised in no uncertain terms the question 
of stepping up security measures to the utmost for Russian 
citizens in Algeria and requested an immediate inquiry into the 
circumstances of this tragic incident. 
  G. Karasin emphasized that a whole series of additional 
arrangements have been made at the initiative of the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to increase the security of our 
specialists living and working in Algeria. Specifically, the 
total number of Russian Federation citizens in the Democratic 
and Popular Republic of Algeria has been halved to around 1,100 
people. The majority of wives and children of our specialists 
have left Algeria. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs told 
Russian ministries and departments which have their own people 
in Algeria and specialists working at economic cooperation sites 
outside the capital of Algeria, as well as Russian Federation 
citizens in the country on private contracts that security 
measures need to be observed to the utmost and that personal 
discipline and organization need to be stepped up.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council, by ITAR-TASS 
correspondents Vladimir Korochantsev and Yuriy Pichugin in 
Pretoria; date of interview not stated: "Vladimir Shumeyko: We 
Support RSA's Desire for Democracy and Are Prepared To 
Cooperate"] 
  [Text] Pretoria -- "Russia and South Africa have much in 
common in the present transitional period of their development 
and that creates very good preconditions for fruitful 
cooperation between them." That was stated by the head of the 
Russian delegation, Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council, in a talk with 
ITAR-TASS correspondents in Pretoria, where he was attending 
Nelson Mandela's inauguration ceremony. 
  "I formed this impression as a result of meetings with RSA 
President Nelson Mandela, First Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, 
and Deputy President Frederik de Klerk," he said. "During my 
talk with F. de Klerk we reached the common opinion that our 
states are sufficiently prepared for the successful continuation 
and development of all-around relations, especially as this 
cooperation does not have to be begun from nothing. 
  "For me as head of the Russian parliament's upper chamber 
and 
chairman of the CIS interparliamentary assembly, it is 
particularly important to ensure the development of 
interparliamentary ties," the head of the Russian Federation 
delegation stressed. "We are now faced with the task of 
creating within the framework of the CIS model legislation for 
the former republics of the Soviet Union. Its fulfillment could 
lead to the point where cooperation between Russia and the RSA 
grows into the same kind of cooperation that exists with the 
other CIS states. 
  "Excellent prospects are opened up for collaboration in the 
political field in connection with the fact that warm, friendly 
relations have formed between Russian Federation President Boris 
Yeltsin, RSA President N. Mandela, and Deputy President F. de 
Klerk within the framework of a process which today is called 
the humanization of politics. We all remember that in the past 
Frederik de Klerk, as president of the RSA, at a hard time for 
our country in October last year, supported Russia in a speech 
he delivered. Such things are not forgotten and they lay the 
foundation for the further development of our relations. 
Russia's firm support for the present democratic reforms in 
South Africa is expressed in President Yeltsin's message which I 
presented to RSA President Mandela and in his verbal message to 
F. de Klerk. 
  "In my talk with F. de Klerk I voiced the thought that the 
international public does not have the right to leave South 
Africa without attention after the victory of the democratic 
elections. It is not ruled out that after the voting and the 
inauguration everyone will calm down and the RSA will be 
abandoned to the tyranny of fate. Nothing like that should 
happen. So I allow the possibility of appealing to the 
international community to continue to support South Africa and 
to display attention toward it and its development. 
  "In that sense our bilateral economic ties are important 
and all necessary conditions exist for their development and 
expansion. The RSA has its problems connected with the 
emergence of its commodities and technologies onto the world 
market after the application of all-embracing and primarily 
economic sanctions against it for decades. That country was 
obliged to develop its own modern technologies. Now with the 
lifting of the boycott South Africa is faced with the task of 
ensuring an outlet for these technologies onto the world market. 
  "Russia is in need of such cooperation and our market is in 
a 
certain sense boundless with regard to this cooperation just as 
the South African market is boundless for many Russian goods, 
particularly conversion goods. Simple and cheaper consumer 
goods could be suitable on the local market. We can also 
discuss military cooperation separately. We discussed all this 
at meeting with President Mandela and F. de Klerk. 
  "During my stay in Pretoria I was convinced that the present 
leadership has favorable opportunities for close collaboration. 
At least I formed the opinion that the president and his two 
deputies have a great personal liking for each other. And that 
is already half the battle, or even more than half. If 
politicians treat each other in a normal, human way that helps 
resolve many complex tasks. 
  "Many good words can be said about the RSA. Its sincere 
desire to ensure successful democratic development gives rise to 
the warmest feelings," V.F. Shumeyko stressed. "With its 
expanses and wide open spaces and boundless fields that country 
reminded me of my Russian home."

Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin held meetings with Indian 
Vice-President Kocheril Raman Narayanan and State Foreign 
Minister Raghunandan Lal Bhatia in Delhi today. They discussed 
questions concerning Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's 
forthcoming official visit to Moscow, which is scheduled to take 
place in June, 1994, the development of Russian-Indian political 
and economic ties as well as a number of international issues. 
  Both sides expressed satisfaction with the develoment of

it is necessary to strengthen ties between the two countries, 
especially in the economic sphere. During the talks the Russian 
and Indian sides focused their attention at the forthcoming vist 
of head of the Indian Government P.V. Narasimha Rao to Russia 
and the completion of work at documents which will be signed 
during his stay in Moscow. 
  Speaking to Russian and foreign journalists, Adamishin 
emphasised that India acquired great significance to the first 
visit to the Russian capital by the Indian prime minister, and 
hoped that the visit will give a new impetus to bilateral 
cooperation in diverse spheres. Especially the two sides should

the Russian minister said. 
  Replying to a question by ITAR-TASS, the first deputy head 
of 
the Russian foreign department said that during the

Tajikistan. Russia supports an inter-Tajik dialogue, putting an 
end to attacks on the borders of Tajikistan, and India also 
adheres to an identical position," Adamishin said.

Olenin and Yuriy Stepanov, who had been handed over to First 
Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin in Islamabad 
recently, resulted from close cooperation between the Russian 
Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) and the Pakistani Defense 
Ministry's Defense Agency. Tatyana Samolis, a spokeswoman for 
the FIS, who said so in an Interfax interview added that her 
statement had been cleared with the Pakistani intelligence. 
  She said that Stepanov and Olenin would arrive in Moscow at 
the end of the week. She explained that they were not forced to 
stay in Russia. They alone will choose the country where they 
will live. Her agency sought only their release. 
  Samolis said that former Soviet POWs were still held in 
Pakistan. She hoped that cooperation between the Russian and 
Pakistani intelligence services would continue.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Vadim Byrkin and Tigran </F>
Liloyan] 
  [Text] Stepanakert 18 May TASS -- The situation in the area 
of the Karabakh conflict remains calm. The warring sides have 
refrained from active combat operations over the past three 
days. Last night and on Wednesday [18 May] morning the Karabakh 
Army was shelled from three directions. Three servicemen were 
wounded. No fire was opened in retaliation, ITAR-TASS learned 
from the press service of the Karabakh Defence Army. 
  The Russian initiative to deploy disengagement troops and 
international observers in the zone of the conflict has been 
received with understanding in Stepanakert which is pinning 
great hopes on this initiative to attain peace. In an interview 
with ITAR-TASS acting chairman of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
parliament Karen Baburyan voiced regret over the breakdown of 
the Moscow talks. 
  He believes that "Azerbaijan showed again that it is not a 
supporter of peaceful settlement of the problem since when it 
comes down to signing any documents or agreements the Azeri 
sides torpedoes the peace-keeping process." No official 
statements were made by Karabakh officials yet. 
  At the same time, an ITAR-TASS correspondent reported from 
Yerevan that on Tuesday night the Azeri side violated a 
ceasefire agreement on Armenia's southern border. According to 
the Armenian Defence Ministry, Azeri troops opened mortar and 
submachine gunfire at Armenian positions from the territory of 
the Nakhichevan Autonomous Region near the border settlement of 
Yeraskhvan of the Armenian Ararat region, which continued from 
2030 until 0100 Wednesday. Casualties were reported. 
  According to a representatives of the Defence Ministry, the 
Armenian side had to open fire in retaliation. Official sources 
said that in other areas of the Armenian and Azeri border the 
situation was calm. No incidents were reported.

<F P=106> [AZERTADZH report: "New Stage in Resolution of the Conflict: </F>
Special CSCE Mission in Baku"] 
  [Text] Urgent matters connected with a resolution of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and the elimination of its 
consequences were discussed at a meeting between Geydar Aliyev, 
president of Azerbaijan, and Jan Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE 
Nagornyy Karabakh Minsk Group, his deputy Matias Mosberg, and 
Vladimir Kazimirov, ambassador at large of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and plenipotentiary 
representative of the president of Russia. 
  The present meeting in Baku essentially signifies, in the 
opinion of the head of the Azerbaijani state, the start of a new 
stage in a settlement of the conflict. He believes that the 
Minsk Group of the CSCE has as of late enlarged the scope of its 
activity and has been adopting a more realistic approach to the 
possibilities of a resolution of the problem, relying on the 
efforts of all its member countries. There was a positive 
assessment here of the interaction of the CSCE Minsk Group and 
Russia, specifically this country's Foreign Ministry, aimed at a 
resolution of the conflict. According to the president of 
Azerbaijan, "this may be considered a new qualitative level of 
the peacemaking process." 
  As Geydar Aliyev emphasized, there is no more important aim 
currently than a search for the most acceptable resolution of 
this complex problem. He expressed confidence that all 
interested parties would act in this direction. The president 
shared the opinion of Jan Eliasson and Vladimir Kazimirov 
concerning the importance of a cease-fire as an indispensable 
condition of the settlement process. "I believe that a 
cease-fire should be followed by specific practical actions 
which culminate in the immediate withdrawal of the Armenian 
armed formations from the occupied territories and the 
implementation of the program specified in CSCE documents," the 
head of the Azerbaijani state noted, in particular. He expressed 
the conviction that these stages should be continuous. Only in 
this case can, in his opinion, real results in a settlement of 
the conflict be achieved. 
  Geydar Aliyev evaluated Azerbaijan's signing of the Bishkek 
Protocol, which has been greeted ambivalently in the Republic, 
as a "correct step" leading to a cease-fire and the creation of 
the conditions for the realization of active practical measures 
to achieve long-term and stable peace in the region. The basis 
for this exists, he maintained, things are quiet currently in 
the conflict zone. It is now a question, he emphasized, of 
consolidating this achievement with the assistance of 
international observers, who should put under supervision the 
processes of demilitarization and the withdrawal of the forces 
of occupation. This, the president of Azerbaijan observed, would 
give everyone confidence in the irreversibility of the 
peacemaking process. 
  Minsk Group Chairman Jan Eliasson, who spoke at the meeting, 
declared that a settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict 
at its present, highly dramatic, stage would require the 
exceptional and swift actions of all interested parties. 
According to him, there is a great risk of the wrong path being 
taken. At the same time the opportunities for the adoption of 
serious and important decisions are just as significant, but 
this, the diplomat believes, presupposes the unification of all 
peacemaking efforts. 
  As Jan Eliasson emphasized, it is essential to do two things 
-- achieve and consolidate a cease-fire and establish 
international observers' supervision of observance of the 
armistice process. The chairman of the Minsk Group announced 
that last week he had had a "good meeting" with Andrey Kozyrev, 
minister of foreign affairs of Russia, and Vladimir Kazimirov, 
ambassador at large of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Russian Federation, on the creation of a "joint monitoring 
structure." 
  We are even now, Jan Eliasson declared, practically prepared 
to send to the conflict zone the first small group of 
international observers. When, however, official opportunities 
are afforded, we can then, he observed, track the sequence of 
the peacemaking process. 
  At the same time the chairman of the Minsk Group emphasized 
that he had to be sure that the process, once begun, would not 
be frozen in the cease-fire phase. Having cited phased progress 
as the main principle of the settlement process, the diplomat 
emphasized the need for "strong connections" between each stage, 
in the form, for example, of a timetable for the withdrawal of 
the troops or the elaboration of confidence-building measures. 
He had the day before, he said, obtained in Vienna the "full 
blessing" of the CSCE for the continuation of actions to achieve 
peace in the zone of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. Jan 
Eliasson also informed the president of Azerbaijan of his New 
York meetings in the UN Security Council and with the secretary 
general of the community of nations, at which ways of achieving 
peace in the region were discussed. 
  Vladimir Kazimirov, plenipotentiary representative of the 
president of Russia for a peace settlement in Nagornyy Karabakh, 
evaluated today's meeting as a very important event. It is no 
accident, therefore, he stressed, that the attention of the 
world community and all people of good will interested in an end 
to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is focused on it at this 
time. 
  As the ambassador maintained, the "risks of peace" are being 
weighed at this time. "And it is essential to reduce these risks 
to a minimum, the prospect of a continuation of the bloodshed 
should be 
jettisoned, in any event," the diplomat emphasized. 
  Vladimir Kazimirov expressed satisfaction that preference 
had 
been given the concept whereby the peacemaking process begins 
with a cease-fire. And this, he believes, is dictated not only 
by humanitarian, but also practical considerations since it 
would be difficult otherwise to resolve the problems that have 
built up over six years of the conflict. The main thing now, he 
observed, is to prevent the detachment of the cease-fire and the 
cessation of hostilities from the next stage, that is, to 
prevent a freezing of the situation. "We need to ensure the 
integrity of the settlement process, and a precise sequence of 
actions must be not a promise but the dependable undertaking of 
all parties to the conflict," the ambassador at large 
emphasized. In his view, this could be secured by a strong 
political agreement, which would require the parties to observe 
it and on which the world community could count with a certain 
degree of confidence." 
  According to Vladimir Kazimirov, the main purpose of the 
Russian side as a mediator is to contribute to not so much a 
rapid as a dependable settlement of the conflict. 
  Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Supreme Council of 
Azerbaijan, 
State Councillor Vafa Gulizade, Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Gasan Gasanov, Nizami Bakhmanov, leader of the Azerbaijani 
community of Nagornyy Karabakh, and Azerbaijani and foreign 
diplomats took part in the meeting. 
  Upon the conclusion of the negotiations the CSCE mediating 
mission left for Yerevan.

<F P=106> [Report by Aydyn Mekhtiyev in the "Azerbaijan" column: </F>
"Heydar Aliyev Has Found Himself in a Difficult Situation. 
What Is the Fate of the Moscow Plan for a Karabakh Settlement?"] 
  [Text] The unexpected finale of the two-day negotiations 
in Moscow between the defense chiefs of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and 
Nagorno-Karabakh with the Russian Federation Defense Ministry's 
mediation has given rise to various forecasts about the future 
of the Russian peace plan. Some tend to believe that the 
refusal by the Azerbaijan delegation to sign the final protocol 
means nothing but yet another failure of the talks, while others 
predict confidently that Baku at any moment will accede to the 
document, which has already been signed by the Armenian side. 
  The conflicting statements by the negotiating parties also 
fail to clear up the situation that has emerged. Thus, 
Col.-Gen. Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian Federation deputy defense 
minister, said that Azerbaijan Defense Minister Mamedrafi 
Mamedov had no authority to sign the protocol, although Mamedov 
himself does not think so. "I had full authority to sign the 
final protocol," he stated, "but I did not do so only because 
some questions called for additional study." The minister 
nonetheless did not specify which of the protocol provisions 
appeared dubious to the Azerbaijan military. 
  As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent was advised by an 
informed source, overnight on 17 May Mamedrafi Mamedov had a 
lengthy telephone conversation with Azerbaijan President Heydar 
Aliyev who ordered him urgently to return to Baku for a detailed 
discussion of the possible implications of signing the Moscow 
protocol. The piquancy of the situation is that a day before, 
on 16 May, Mamedov gave no indication that he might not sign the 
final document. This prompted Russian Defense Minister Grachev 
to announce that Moscow's plan was fully approved by the sides. 
  The somewhat strange behavior by the Azerbaijan defense 
department chief can be apparently attributed to the fact that 
the negotiations in Moscow took place amid a sharp aggravation 
of the internal political situation in Azerbaijan. Nearly all 
political forces in opposition to the present powers charged 
Parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev, who had earlier signed the 
Bishkek protocol, with high treason and demanded an urgent 
convocation of a parliament (milli mejlis) session. Last 
Saturday Rasul Guliyev, appearing on national television, 
sharply criticized the opposition and warned it against any 
attempts to destabilize the situation in the country. The 
parliament speaker's position however was exacerbated by the 
fact that disapproving assessments of his performance were also 
made within the presidential team itself. 
  According to information obtained by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's 
correspondent from confidential sources, some influential people 
who shape the republic's foreign policy told the president that 
the parliament speaker had exceeded his powers by signing the 
Bishkek protocol. Furthermore, they warned President Aliyev 
that they might resign in the event that Defense Minister 
Mamedrafi Mamedov signed the Moscow protocol on 17 May, giving 
the "go ahead" to the introduction of Russian troops into 
Azerbaijan. 
  Therefore Heydar Aliyev has been confronted with a complex 
dilemma: Either to ignore the warnings from a number of his 
close associates over the possible negative effects of signing 
the Moscow protocol or to opt for a stalling tactic in order to 
make a final choice. As can be seen, the president has chosen 
the second. He had to postpone indefinitely his official visit 
to Georgia's capital which was to have begun on 17 May. In the 
past few days the president has been holding tense consultations 
with members of his team and also trying to reconcile the 
supporters and opponents of the Moscow protocol. The division 
in the presidential team over the upcoming introduction of 
Russian troops to Azerbaijan is indirectly confirmed by the 
admission of President Aliyev's adviser that "neither the 
president nor the foreign minister has seen the document now 
being discussed in Moscow" and therefore there can be no 
question about a speedy signing of the Moscow protocol. 
  An informed source in the republic's Foreign Affairs 
Ministry 
stressed that Azerbaijan's foreign policy department does not 
support the position of the defense minister and the parliament 
speaker who advocate the signing of the Moscow protocol. The 
Foreign Affairs Ministry leadership is trying to convince Aliyev 
that the peace-keeping forces should be introduced into the 
conflict area only within the CSCE framework. "It is not known 
just how Russian generals will behave in the absence of 
oversight by international observers over the actions of Russian 
troops in the region," a source in the Foreign Affairs Ministry 
told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent. 
  Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian Federation president's 
special envoy who arrived in Baku, has been trying in the past 
few days to persuade President Aliyev to support the position of 
Azerbaijan's parliament and Defense Ministry leadership on the 
issue of accession to the 17 May Moscow protocol. At the same 
time the National Assembly met in session on the morning of 18 
May in Baku, where demands were heard to annul Azerbaijan's 
signature under the Bishkek protocol and to prevent the signing 
of the Moscow protocol. As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA was going to 
press it was not yet known which decision was made.

  [Text] Baku, 15 May (TURAN)--On 15 May, at midnight, the 
broadcasting of the independent television, BMTI, was stopped. 
  On 14 May in the evening, the owner of the television 
company, President of Gunay company, the Chairman of 
Azerbaijan's Democratic Party of Businesspeople, Makhmud 
Mamedov, addressed viewers on television. 
  He said that recently, such high-ranking officials in the 
country such as Rasul Guliyev, State Advisor for Humanitarian 
Matters, Gabil Guseinli, and the Chairman of State Television 
company "AzTV," Babek Guseinoglu, have been making attempts to 
close television company BMTI. 
  The head of the television company called the authorities' 
activities illegal. "BMTI concluded an agreement with the 
Ministry of Communication concerning the lease of the 
television-channel for 25 years and paid the 1994 rent," said 
Mamedov. 
  The independent television company BMTI began broadcasting 
in 
summer 1993. Other independent companies were not permitted 
broadcasting time for various reasons.

  [Text] The number of Azerbaijan's citizens applying to the 
Russian Federation Embassy's consular office for Russian 
citizenship has grown. The population's worry has been caused 
by the fact that the validity of a simplified procedure, under 
the law "On Russian Federation Citizenship," for acquiring 
citizenship is expected to end soon -- in February 1995, as has 
been announced. 
  Oleg Boyko, first secretary of the Russian Embassy in 
Azerbaijan and head of the consular office, has advised that the 
deadline will be extended by a special edict. He has served a 
reminder that the simplified registration rule only applies to 
those who originally come from Russia. Besides, persons moving 
to Russia for permanent residence can register their citizenship 
with internal affairs bodies of the Russian Federation after 
they have decided on their new place of residence in accordance 
with the law.

  [Text] Stepanakert ("AZG", "YERKIR" dailies), 05/18/94 -- 
No significant changes have been reported at the Karabakh fronts 
during the last two days. Nevertheless, the Azeri units have 
been shelling the Armenian positions at the villages of 
Seisulan, Karmiravan and Gasangaya in the Mardakertskiy district 
and Gyullija, Suma and Umudlu in the Agdamskiy district during 
the night and in the morning of 17 May. The enemy used mortars 
and grenade dischargers. According to preliminary information, 
the Karabakh side suffered no casualties. Meanwhile, "YERKIR" 
reports, quoting "HAYLUR" agency, one Armenian fighter was 
injured. 
  According to the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] 
Defense Army headquarters, the enemy shelled the Karabakh 
positions at the village of Giulistan in the Shaumyanskiy 
district later in the afternoon. Again, no casualties are 
reported. By 1700, the Azeri forces shelled the Karabakh 
positions in the Fizulinskiy district and in the environs of the 
Umar gorge at the north of the Kelbadzharskiy district. 
  The RMK forces refrained from returning the fire in all 
cases.

  [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 05/18/94--Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev declared on 16 May, an agreement 
was reached on stationing the Russian peace-keeping forces in 
the region, starting from 24 May. Nevertheless, the Azeri 
Defense Minister has been refusing to sign this agreement till 
late evening. According to reliable sources, signing the 
agreement was postponed till 1000 on 17 May. The Azeri 
representative didn't come to this meeting, having left for Baku 
during the night, without notifying the sides. Political 
experts believe, the departure is related with aggravation of 
political situation in Azerbaijan, as opposition parties 
threatened to start political actions, if the agreement is 
signed. 
  Russian President's Special Envoy Vladimir Kazimirov left to 
Baku on the same day. It's hard to guess whether Kazimirov will 
be able to persuade Azerbaijan in necessity of Russian presence, 
but he has declared several times that Russian forces will enter 
the conflict zone only if all sides agree with this. 
  Reliable sources report, CSCE Minsk group chairman went to 
Moscow to participate in this meeting, but wasn't allowed doing 
so. 
  We would like to remind that the Russian project stipulates 
a 
withdrawal of forces without preconditions in three days after a 
cease-fire is established. According to this project, troops 
will be introduced to Zangelanskiy and Dzhebrailskiy districts; 
regular police forces will be stationed in Agdamskiy and 
Fizulinskiy. Blockade is to be lifted only after the Armenian 
forces are withdrawn from Kubatlinskiy and Kelbadzharskiy 
districts. 
  At the same time "AZG" reports, the Azeri representatives 
asked to postpone their decision till 2400 on 17 May, and 
refused to sign the document when the time came. Baku radio 
reported that the Azeri delegation didn't have the power for 
signing such an agreement. This information is confirmed by 
Russian "Novosti" TV program which said, there were two 
hindrances to the agreement. First is the Armenian demand to 
recognize Mountainous Karabakh as a side of the conflict and 
second, Azeri side not being empowered to sign the agreement. 
According to Novosti, the Azeri side declared yesterday they 
have no such power, and left to Baku for additional 
consultations. At the same time "Azatutyun" radio reported, 
after preliminary talks to the Azeri side Armenians have got the 
impression that Azerbaijan is ready to discuss the status of 
Mountainous Karabakh earlier than planned, ie immediately, after 
a cease fire is established.

  [Text] Baku, 18 MAY (SNARK)--The Azeri President Geydar 
Aliyev's visit to Georgia, which had to take place today is 
postponed. Sources in Baku refrain from commenting on the 
reasons of the visit's abolition. 
  The observers say, Aliyev was obliged to postpone his visit 
because of the aggravation of the internal situation in 
Azerbaijan. It is due to the adoption by Azerbaijan of the 
Bishkek protocol and the possible signing of the Moscow 
agreement on the Karabakh conflict's settlement. 
  In connection with this, the Azeri opposition forces will 
try 
to obtain the abolition of the "disgraceful for Azerbaijan" 
Bishkek protocol during the today's session of the Milli Majlis. 
  Meanwhile, the speaker of Parliament Rasul Guliyev, signed 
the Bishkek protocol and roused the opposition's range, came out 
the other day in support of the Milli Majlis dissolution. He 
said rejecting the Russian peaceful initiative the Parliament is 
going against the national interests of the Azerbaijani people.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Bablumyan: "The Armenian Trade Minister </F>
Was Sent to a Detention Center, But He Returned to His Office"] 
  [Text] Yerevan -- Armenian Trade Minister Tigran Grigoryan, 
who was arrested last week, was released two days later, but he 
has no intention of making out that nothing happened. 
  In conversation with IZVESTIYA's correspondent he described 
how he was arrested. 
  "A few minutes before the start of a collegium session an 
unfamiliar man entered my work office and, referring to the fact 
that he had suffered at the time of the Chernobyl tragedy, 
demanded that I issue a license to trade in alcoholic beverages. 
I did not even have time to tell him to whom and where it is 
necessary to apply in such cases, before a second stranger burst 
into the room and placed a pile of dollars on the table. `This 
is a bribe,' he explained, and left equally suddenly. Without 
touching the money, I at once asked my assistant over the 
intercom to detain the rogues, but militia personnel had already 
entered the office and ordered me not to move. You would have 
to be very naive not to see an obvious provocation in what 
happened. There can be no doubt that the `cooperators' were 
agents of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. But I still cannot 
understand who needed to make precisely myself the hero of such 
a comedy or why. I am simply obliged to see this matter through 
to the end, and I expect answers to all my questions." 
  It would, of course, be a great exaggeration to allege that 
ministers are jailed in Armenia almost every week. At the same 
time the official authorities make no comment at all on such 
happenings, even the most recent. In the conversation with 
IZVESTIYA's correspondent the trade minister found it hard to 
explain why the government, of which he is a member, did not 
issue an appropriate statement right after his arrest and still 
continues to maintain silence. 
  Meanwhile, as Armenia's general prosecutor declared, the 
minister was arrested without his approval, and there are no 
grounds for charging Tigran Grigoryan. An investigation is 
still continuing, however, and this alone will be able to dot 
all the "i's." But for the time being people will go on 
whispering for a long time behind the back of the minister, who 
has been defamed before the whole world.

  [Text] Until now, 50 of the 300 commercial facilities in 
Tbilisi have been privatized and of these, half have been partly 
privatized. The privatization of enterprises is proceeding 
slowly, said Tbilisi Mayor Niko Lekishvili in an interview to a 
BS-PRESS correspondent. The situation is better regarding the 
privatization of living accommodations, 50 percent of which have 
been privatized; the process of legalization is continuing. 
  A new stage of privatization is beginning in the Georgian 
capital, so-called "large privatization" that affects a number 
of large enterprises and commercial facilities, stated Niko 
Lekishvili. The corresponding decree of the head of state has 
been prepared and the process will begin very shortly. The 
question of purchasing facilities that are to be privatized in 
freely convertible currency so as to prevent the budget from 
incurring damage due to inflation is being discussed in the 
corresponding departments. 
  The mayor of Tbilisi stated that one of the obstacles to 
privatization was the position occupied by a number of 
ministries and departments that were not interested in 
developing privatization and were hindering it.

blown up in the Gali Rayon of Abkhazia. As a result, half of 
the republic's territory was left without electricity. The 
authorities in Sukhumi believe that Georgian saboteurs are to 
blame. 
  Moreover, the Georgian Army has still not received the 
command to withdraw its troops from the line of contact with the 
Abkhazian formations. I will remind you that a security zone is 
to be set up here, which is provided for in the agreement signed 
in Moscow between Tbilisi and Sukhumi.

Tajik-Afghan border continue. Several attempts by a group of 
supporters of the Islamic Revival of Tajikistan movement to 
force entry from Afghanistan through a number of sectors of 
Pyanj and Moscow frontier guard detachments into the republic's 
territory were thwarted by Russian frontier guards on the night 
of May 18. 
  The same night the Tajik opposition militants shelled a 
number of Russian border check points in the Shurobad direction 
from the rear. The enemy weapon emplacements were neutralized by 
the Russian frontier guard detachment shelling. There were no 
casualties reported among the Russian servicemen. 
  ITAR-TASS was informed of these facts by military sources in 
Dushanbe today. According to the sources, a large-scale 
operation to uncover and neutralize militant groups of the Tajik 
opposition, which penetrated the Tajik border territory during 
the past few weeks, is underway in the Shurobad direction in the 
zone guarded by the Moscow frontier guard detachment. 
  Tajikistan's Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Security and 
Ministry of the Interior detachments are taking active part in 
the operation together with the Russian frontier guards.

  [Text] First Deputy Chairman of the Tajik Supreme Court 
Abdulmajid Dostiyev rejected in an INTERFAX interview the 
opposition's allegations that the discussion of a constitution 
draft was illegal because every fifth resident of the country 
had left it. 
  He said that, according to the UN, there were 27,000 Tajik 
refugees in Afghanistan while 110,000 people moved to other CIS 
member nations but as few as 5000 of them were ethnic Tajiks 
while the others were Russian speakers who had returned to their 
old countries. 
  Dostiyev said that the opposition had every opportunity to 
discuss the constitution draft in the country's mass media. He 
added that hundreds of copies of the draft had been sent to 
Moscow, St. Petersburg and Afghanistan. 
  He doubted that alternative drafts were in existence. If 
they did, their publication would be useful. 
  Dostiyev said that most responses to the draft were positive 
and there were no essential objections to or constructive 
criticism of the draft to speak of. 
  He said he would insist that the Constitution be adopted by 
a 
referendum. If this does not work for any reason, it could be 
adopted in a congress at which all areas, towns and 
organizations are represented, he said. He expected the Supreme 
Soviet to make a decision on this early in July.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor of Economic Sciences Yuriy Brovka: </F>
"They Say `Confederation' but Mean `Federation'"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] As for the creation of a 
confederation on the territory of the former USSR, in my 
opinion, we missed that opportunity back in 1990-91. Currently, 
we can only discuss a slow moving forward toward a confederation 
based on CIS structures. Given favorable circumstances, this 
goal can be achieved no earlier than 10 or 15 years from now. 
However, everything will depend on how quickly the European 
Union members adopt a similar path. 
  We can speak about a confederation on the territory of the 
entire area of the former USSR, including some neighboring 
states, however, the idea of a confederation of two entities -- 
Russia and Belarus -- is absolutely illusionary. Two states, so 
different in size (correlation in the population is 15:1 and in 
territory -- 70:1), cannot unite in one confederation, a union 
of sovereign states, which foresees not only formal equality, 
but equal rights in adopting decisions. The point is that the 
confederation is built on the "dual key" principle. However, 
will Russia agree that one Belarusian vote has the same power as 
15 Russian votes? I am afraid that those, who insist on setting 
up a confederation of two entities, understand this all too 
well. They say "confederation" but mean a federation, with a 
strong centripetal tendency. Well, two subjects will hardly 
establish a federation. Do they mean a simple incorporation of 
the Republic of Belarus into the Russian Federation with some 
rights of "autonomy?" This danger exists, and our citizens 
should realize that the status of a former autonomous republic 
within Russia cannot be compared with the status of a republic 
within the former USSR. Though my attitude toward relations 
between the federal and republican organs in the former USSR is 
overly critical, I have to admit that from a legal point of 
view, all the republics were formally equal before the center of 
the federation. This formal equality had, at least, 
psychological significance and encouraged, to a certain degree, 
the preservation of a specific amount of national culture, and 
even some economic welfare. Nothing of this kind has ever been 
noticed within the Russian Federation. Many of its bodies, even 
until lately, were of a purely unitary nature. Currently, the 
issue of the status of the national republics within the Russian 
Federation remains very complicated, even regarding regions 
where people with a high national awareness reside in close 
quarters to one another. Until now, none of the former 
"autonomies" failed to obtain guarantees from Moscow for an easy 
withdrawal from the Russian Federation. 
  For Belarus, incorporation into the Russian Federation would 
mean a national catastrophe. Short-term advantages arising from 
this decision will destruct everything that identifies the 
independence of Belarus. This will happen not due to the 
imperial aggressiveness of the Russians, but due to the weakness 
of the national awareness of Belarusians. Therefore, during the 
upcoming elections for president and Supreme Soviet deputies, 
Belarusians should be on the alert: What do the candidates 
propose? Do they support Belarusian sovereignty? 
  All the remaining issues -- a degree of economic integration 
with Russia, the attempts to achieve the status of a neutral 
state, cooperation within the CIS security system, with NATO and 
other defense unions, currency union with Russia and other CIS 
states -- can be resolved by various means regarding the 
difference in voters' opinions and different approaches to the 
domestic and foreign situation. However, any program should 
unequivocally provide for the state independence of Belarus.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Stanislavovich Dovgel, director of </F>
the Scientific-Economic Center `Ekon,' by unidentified reporter; 
place and date not given: "We Have One Circulatory System But 
Two Heads...."] 
  [Text] A monetary merger pact has most probably divided the 
people into two groups -- supporting and opposing. 
Nevertheless, we can assess this pact using objective science. 
Our expert Yevgeniy Dovgel, director of the Scientific-Economic 
Center "Ekon," ponders the issue of an economic union and a 
joint monetary system. 
  [Dovgel] This idea is not so bad, however, it is not modern. 
It has a lengthy history and big prospects. Many people support 
the idea that all obstacles for labor and capital on earth 
should be removed, and a highly developed language of 
international contacts and a stable international currency 
should be introduced. The question is only how this can be 
implemented, so that each state gains benefits. To realize 
"people's dreams," it is necessary to provide for two 
conditions. First, the international currency should not be 
subject to inflation; second, sovereign states-members of this 
union should have nondeficit budgets. If these two conditions 
are not observed, this union will not last long. The emission 
center will work as a huge vacuum cleaner, that is, it will suck 
resources and goods from neighboring states from its allies by 
issuing noncovered money and credits; at the same time, the 
states -- with deficit budgets -- will become dependent on this 
center and will be forced to introduce their national 
currencies. This simple theory has been proven in practice. 
The United States and Canada, for example, set up their single 
economic space long ago but still cannot have a single currency 
(with the dollar being a world authority!). The European Union 
members lift economic borders and customs checkpoints, but 
preserve their currencies and gradually, with great effort and 
caution, establish their international currency -- the ECU. The 
Viskuli agreement regarding the CIS was an example of such a 
quick "resolution" to the problem. They agreed to establish a 
single economic space, a unified budget policy, coordinated work 
of customs offices, and the free transit of goods. However, we 
had all these conditions earlier and the states were members of 
a single ruble zone. Nevertheless, everything collapsed too 
quickly because economic laws cannot be abolished by government 
decrees. 
  [SEM DNEY] Yevgeniy Stanislavovich, could we obtain the 
results similar to those of the Viskuli agreement? 
  [Dovgel] According to the initiators of the signed 
agreement, 
it just mirrors various agreements, which formulated the 
establishment and functioning of the CIS as a union of 
independent states, each of which wishes to preserve its own 
legislature and government. At the same time, the goal is to 
set up a single ruble zone of the USSR-type, a "circulatory 
system" in a single organism, to set up an organism which will 
have one circulatory system but two heads. An enterprise having 
two boards and two managing directors can serve as an example of 
this case. Or we can compare it with two families living 
separately but using one budget. 
  [SEM DNEY] Sometimes, the issue of this pact is raised in 
the 
following way: "What part of our sovereignty have we lost?" 
  [Dovgel] I understand the sovereignty as a priority in 
domestic matters and an opportunity to independently formulate a 
foreign policy. For example, an old-age pension in Belarus is a 
little higher than in Russia, while prices for bread, milk, and 
some other products are considerably lower. When we shift to 
Russian taxation and a single budget (even if it is called a 
"Consolidated" budget, written with an upper case), everything 
will be unified. Otherwise, the Russian Government will have to 
pay larger subsidies to Belarusian pensioners than to those 
living in Russia. Issuing subsidies to lower prices in Belarus 
from a unified budget will also be unreal because Russia has 
already introduced market prices. To say nothing about issuing 
credits to the agricultural sector that our National Bank did 
not long ago by a decision of the Supreme Soviet. As for 
foreign policy, we have already adopted the Russian customs 
legislation. We will have to look back to the center when 
receiving foreign loans, because repaying loans will have to be 
included in the unified budget. 
  [SEM DNEY] That means that the sovereignty of the Republic 
will be restricted to some extent. 
  [Dovgel] Probably, that is so. However, the sovereignty is 
not an end in itself. If only integration of the Republic with 
Russia could raise the welfare of our people, we could seriously 
discuss this subject. However, the standard of living in Russia 
is decreasing more quickly than in Belarus. National income in 
Russia has shrunk by 14 percent in 1991, by 22 percent -- in 
1992, and by 14.6 percent -- in 1993 (while in Belarus -- by 
2.11 percent and 10 percent, respectively). I would also advise 
reading articles by S. Govorukhin in SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA. 
Russia is far from being the state that we knew, remember, and 
love. Many do not realize this. We should be careful not to get 
out of the frying pan into the fire after our election campaign. 
  [SEM DNEY] Do you mean that currently an economic union with 
Russia is unachievable or unwelcome? 
  [Dovgel] It is both achievable and welcome! Moreover, not 
only with Russia but with all other states, and we cannot speak 
about any isolationism. A single currency could be of use to 
all the members of this economic union, and their sovereignty 
would not be infringed on. Only two conditions should be 
fulfilled that I have already spoken about. We can make a 
proposal on how to do it. If customs checkpoints at the borders 
are liquidated (there were some attempts in Belarus), and the 
motives for work at the enterprises and stimuli for development 
of production are not created, then resources and goods will 
simply "run away" from Belarus to places where prices for them 
are higher, and earnings will be used for buying various 
licenses and quotas, as well as for building new cottages. 
  [SEM DNEY] What is your attitude to statements declaring 
that prices will not be increased anymore and only wages will 
grow? 
  [Dovgel] We no longer require statements, we had many. We 
require precise and meaningful decisions which could organize 
our people in creative and efficient labor. People should have 
an opportunity to work for themselves and for their families at 
enterprises and they will then be able to move mountains, 
otherwise, they will work on their private plots irrespective of 
what zone we have -- ruble or "hare." Whichever unions are 
signed, we should realize that foreign economic conditions -- 
favorable or unfavorable -- could only indirectly affect the 
national economy because the same people will work. 
  [SEM DNEY] What does the "Ekon" center propose? 
  [Dovgel] We propose a program formulating how to stabilize 
and quickly recover the Republic's economy. This program has 
already been put to a test; it is supported by authoritative 
researchers, working collectives, trade unions, and has been 
approved at an international conference. In addition, we 
propose a package of documents regarding specific methodology 
for raising the economic efficiency of enterprises (with all 
technical specifications) that had been tested in practice. 
  Recently, we established the Republican civilian association 
"Ekon" to foster economic development and promote our concept.

<F P=106> [Report by Valyantsin Zhdanko: "Vyachaslaw Kebich Warns: </F>
`If the Presidential Campaign Is a Bust,' Belarus Will Most 
Likely Not Join Ruble Zone] 
  [Text] One of the main arguments and trump cards of the 
prime minister in the presidential campaign is the 
Russian-Belarusian agreement on joining the common ruble zone. 
However, hope for an immediate provision of Belarusian citizens 
with tricolored Russian banknotes did not come true. This 
hampers Mr. Kebich's campaign to a great extent. 
  Relations with Russia and the forthcoming monetary union are 
the main topics at meetings of the prime minister and his 
electorate. They were also much discussed at Mr. Kebich's 
meeting with professors of institutes of higher education in 
Minsk, which was held at the Belarusian State University on 12 
May. The present stage of the implementation of the 
above-mentioned agreement was assessed by the prime minister in 
the following way: 
  "Nine articles out of 12 are already in force. The most 
essential article of this agreement concerns the lifting of 
custom duties, quotas, and tariffs. Practically, it means that 
prices for imported Russian goods will be lowered by about 25-30 
percent. Consequently, this leads to a decrease in production 
costs and to a possibility of falling retail prices. However, 
it is undesirable to decrease retail prices today. Why? 
Because even at current prices, a great flood of goods 
(especially foodstuffs) outside of Belarus exists. Therefore, 
our task is, while preserving the same retail prices, to 
increase wages. This is a more proper way, and we will follow 
it." 
  "With regard to other articles of the agreement, I should 
say 
that we need to bring some legislative acts in line with 
legislative acts of the Russian Federation. However, I will 
tell you honestly: During our talks with the Russian leadership, 
one could sense an underlying sentiment: `We will wait and see 
who will become your president...' The document signed by Oleg 
Soskovets, Russia's first deputy prime minister, specifies the 
term. Nine articles come in force before 31 July. Note that 
this term was chosen not accidentally... Let us say 
straightforwardly: If the presidential elections are a bust, 
this may prevent the union from being formed." 
  In general, during the meeting, Mr. Kebich frequently 
accentuated the delicacy of relations with our eastern neighbor 
and their tendency to fluctuations due to seemingly 
insignificant factors: 
  "There was a mention of our victory over Moscow regiments 
near Orsha in 1514, and Russia cut off its gas supplies. This 
was not accidental. We still owe debts to Russia for gas -- but 
gas supplies continue... There was a mention of Belarusian 
claims to Bransk and Smolensk Oblasts, for Vilnius region -- and 
we received the next warning: `We will halt gas supplies if you 
do not start paying.' Politics know no trifles. One has to be 
very careful about politics and assess the situation very 
accurately." 
  Understandably, Mr. Kebich himself has never made any such 
statements on the victory near Orsha or some territorial claims. 
Apparently, he had in mind statements and actions by the 
Belarusian Popular Front... 
  The prime minister firmly cut himself off from the radical 
ideas of both the "right" and the "left." He promised 
stability, consequence, and continual progress after his victory 
in the elections.

<F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Sukhova in the "Election Campaign in </F>
Belarus" column: "State Security and Militia Men Play the Role 
of Agitators"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the registration of presidential 
candidates closed in Minsk. The election campaign is in full 
swing, and election battles are under way across the territory 
of Belorussia [Belarus]. 
  Sensitive to the electrified political atmosphere in the 
republic and the candidates' overflowing game spirit, the 
Internal Affairs Ministry and the Defense Ministry have decided 
to join the election struggle. To avoid a repetition of 
mistakes and so as not "to step on a rake," Minsk decided to 
find out in good time whose side "the man with the gun" is on so 
as to be able to revise his position if necessary. 
  According to the RID news agency, a special analytical group 
including nine officers has been set up in the Defense 
Ministry's Education Directorate. The first poll it conducted 
showed an incontestable lead by Premier Vyacheslav Kebich (56 
percent of the military vote). His main rival Aleksandr 
Lukashenko has earned the trust of only 15 percent of the 
military, and Stanislav Shushkevich was hard put to get even 
four percent. In all likelihood, this four percent have not as 
yet heard rumors about the ex-speaker's recent May Day speech in 
Baranovichi. This, in spite of the fact that Belorussia's 
security bodies have already compiled a circumstantial report on 
this trip. 
  According to a state security official, who "accidentally" 
was present at the meeting, Shushkevich was rather sharp "about 
Belorussia's military problems." In particular he said that 
"compensation to the military must be lower than to Internal 
Affairs Ministry employees because they do not risk their lives 
every single minute." (In addition, according to the same 
source, Shushkevich also maintained that military pensions must 
be paid by Russia, also complaining, "Where is the hard currency 
for the continued presence of Russian military bases on 
Belorussia's territory?") Now the ex-speaker justifies himself 
by saying that the report by the special services contains 
"distorted facts which nonetheless look very much like the truth 
although there is only five percent of the truth in it." 
  Two more questions are left open: On whose desks have copies 
of the report been laid, and by what right are special services 
spying on a candidate? According to RID, the special services 
have already produced no fewer than 10 reports on statements by 
presidential candidates which were submitted to the premier. 
  Yet in spite of the seeming vigor of the election campaign, 
Shushkevich "is bringing up the column's rear." In the 
"presidential race" lead car is Vyacheslav Kebich. But even he 
has to look over his shoulder all the time because Aleksandr 
Lukashenko can overtake him any moment. True, Belorussia's 
"implacable mafia fighter" can be let down not only by the 
brakes but also the engine: The Slavic White Russia Union 
[Sobor], driving him towards the presidency, is going to revise 
its policy of promoting three candidates simultaneously, 
confining itself to just one. The reason for this decision was 
the disagreements that emerged within the Union: Four Minsk 
district groups raising signatures in support of Lukashenko 
refused to collaborate with him attributing this to the 
"inconsistent conduct of Aleksandr Grigorievich's entourage." 
Thus, the "Belorussian Commissar Cattagnio's" support group has 
reduced by 400 people." 
  And this at a time when a mere 20,000 signatures were needed 
to meet the required 100,000. In a bid to curb disagreements 
White Russia stated that on 4 June it will announce one of the 
three candidates: Lukhashenko, Kebich, or Novikov. And then the 
people will have to make their choice....

  [Text] Mircea Snegur, president of the Republic of 
Moldova, has decided to join the Moldovan Agrarian Democratic 
Party [PDAM], winner of the parliamentary elections that took 
place two and a half months ago, our correspondent Alexandru 
Beleavschi reported, quoting sources in the Moldovan Presidency. 
  Thus, President Snegur's decision makes it possible today 
for 
all Chisinau's leaders to be united under the banner of the 
PDAM. Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli is one of the PDAM 
leaders, Petru Lucinschi, president of the Moldovan Parliament, 
also ran on the lists of this party at the recent parliamentary 
elections, and Dumitru Motpan, president of the party, is the 
vice president of the Parliament in Chisinau.

  [Text] Over 500 miners at nine pits in the Karaganda Coal 
Mining Area in North Kazakhstan refused to go underground on 
Wednesday [18 May]. The strike is staged at the call of the 
Independent Mine Workers' Union, which demands that the 
Karaganda Coal administration sign an agreement to guarantee 
better social conditions, such as the timely payment of the 
wages, social, and medical insurance and the allocation of 
credits for the purchase of housing. 
  The administration refuses to sign such an agreement with 
the 
union on the grounds that an agreement on tariffs has already 
been signed with the official unions. 
  On the eve of the strike the Director General of Karaganda 
Coal, Grigoriy Present, sent a cable to the mines, qualifying 
the action of protest as illegal. It will be regarded as 
absenteeism, he said. 
  The official unions of mine workers did not support the 
strike either, viewing it as illegal and untimely.

  [Text] On 18 May, members of the official Bulgarian 
delegation who are on a visit to Almaty in connection with 
Bulgaria in Kazakhstan Days, were received by Deputy Prime 
Minister Sergey Kulagin. Zakhariy Zakhariyev, the head of the 
Bulgarian delegation, deputy of the People's Assembly of 
Bulgaria, and chairman of the Federation of Friendship with the 
peoples of Russia and CIS, noted that meetings held in the 
previous days with representatives of the government, business 
circles, and public movements of Kazakhstan allowed him to 
establish contacts which will give a new impact to the relations 
between the two countries. He spoke about a number of 
particular projects aimed at setting up joint ventures. In 
particular the Bulgarian side developed a program of cooperation 
in the field of the defense industry, setting up of a large 
transport enterprise, and in the manufacturing of cigarettes. 
Kulagin said all the projects would be examined by specialists. 
Kazakhstan in its turn also has proposals to expand business 
partnership with Bulgaria and will submit these proposals for 
consideration by the Bulgarian side. 
  On the same day the delegation was received by Foreign 
Minister Kanat Saudabayev. He stressed that the visit of the 
president of Bulgaria Zhelu Zhelev to Kazakhstan last year had a 
powerful impact on the development of bilateral relations. Now 
a possibility exists to fill with real substance all the 
agreements on increasing economic contacts between our states. 
  Valentin Gatsinski, the Bulgarian first deputy foreign 
minister, expressed hope that in the near future our countries 
would exchange embassies. He recalled the words of renowned 
economists of the world that the shortest way between the new 
technology of the West and the richest potential of Eurasia goes 
through Kazakhstan. The members of the Bulgarian delegation 
passed on to the Foreign Ministry of Kazakhstan a draft 
intergovernmental agreement prepared by them on avoiding double 
taxation.

  [Text] Kyrgyzstan wants its relations with Japan to develop 
dynamically and along many fronts, President Askar Akayev said 
Wednesday [18 May] when he met with the Japanese economic 
mission in Kyrgyzstan. 
  He said that his country would welcome wider activities of 
Japanese businessmen and that a Japanese business center would 
be set up in the capital Bishkek shortly. Akayev emphasized 
that Japan's aid in reconstructing the republic's economy, in 
particular in reforming the banking system was invaluable. 
  Akayev thought that Japan could be involved in structural 
changes now underway in Kyrgyzstan. He supported the 
Japan-proposed, long-term Silk Route of the 21st Century project 
of developing telecommunication and airlines between Eastern 
Europe, Russia and South East and Central Asia. 
  The project would turn Kyrgyzstan into a center of 
transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia, 
Akayev thought.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 18, BNS -- The chairman of the 
Independents faction in the Estonian parliament, Jaanus Raidal, 
in an interview with BNS today said it was high time for Prime 
Minister Mart Laar to resign. 
  "It's absolutely clear that if the government's affairs are 
not going well, the prime minister himself would resign. A 
political government coalition is strong only if it finds a new 
suitable person from among its members for the prime minister's 
office," Raidal said. 
  The parliament faction of the governing coalition's senior 
party, Pro Patria, at a meeting today voted in favor of a 
proposal by Prime Minister Mart Laar to dismiss Defense Minister 
Indrek Kannik. Laar has said that Kannik's activity fails to 
fall in line with the government's majority. 
  Kannik at a meeting of the Cabinet later in the day is 
expected to propose the resignation of Laar's Cabinet as a 
whole. Kannik received considerable support for his proposal at 
a meeting of the Pro Patria party council today. 
  Raidal, and independent MP, called the prime minister's move 
to dismiss Kannik "unethical." 
  He predicted that Laar will have to leave his office as 
prime 
minister at least by September. 
  "Even if today brings no solution for the issue, it will 
happen in the near future," Raidal said.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 18, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar in an interview with BNS today declined to comment on 
the reasons why the Pro Patria party faction in the parliament 
today had decided to seek the discharging of Indrek Kannik from 
the post of the Defense Minister. 
  "I'd rather talk about it tomorrow, after we have discussed 
the issue also in the government," Laar said. 
  Tonight's Cabinet meeting is not connected with the 
dismissal 
of Indrek Kannik from the office of the defense minister, the 
premier said. "This meeting was called already before the Pro 
Patria started to adopt its decisions," Laar said. But he also 
mentioned that the situation had become "intolerable." "Now the 
Pro Patria faction has made its decisions," Laar said. 
  Answering a question if it was possible that Pro Patria 
might 
split if Kannik and some of his allies were defeated in the 
current power struggle, Laar said he considers such development 
of the affairs a very regrettable prospect. 
  "One of the main objectives of my activity in the last half 
year has been to avoid such conflicts," the prime minister said. 
He added that although he had tried avoid a conflict, "each 
thing has its limits and now these limits have been reached." 
  The prime minister declined to say whether he had plans to 
make other changes in the Cabinet apart from Kannik's dismissal. 
  Laar said he had not delivered to the president a formal 
proposal to dismiss Kannik. He said he is going to formally 
seek the president's approval for the replacement after the 
Cabinet has approved the decision made by the Pro Patria faction.

  [Text] The ruling Fatherland Party parliamentary faction 
agreed, on Wednesday [18 May], to Prime Minister Mart Laar's 
proposition to dismiss Minister of Defence Indrek Kannik, while 
the board of the Fatherland party decided to make a proposition 
to the government to resign. 
  Head of the Fatherland parliamentary faction Tiit Sinissar 
told ETA that the prime minister considered it necessary to make 
some changes in the composition of the government to increase 
the stability and working ability of the government. One of the 
means was to change the defence minister with whom the Prime 
Minister has had most of disagreements with. Sinissaar said 
that the agreement on the decision was quite unanimous by the 
faction. "There is no question of splitting up of the faction, 
only some fractions might depart," Sinissaar stated. 
  The board of the Fatherland party, however, decided at its 
emergency session on Wednesday to make a proposition to the 
government to resign, stating differences of opinion that have 
created tension in the government as the reason. 
  Member of the board of the party Mart Nutt told ETA that the 
decision was not directed against any definite person in the 
government, but was to be considered as a step to solve tensions 
in the government. Nutt stressed that the decision of the board 
of the party was not binding to the government. The position of 
the parliamentary faction is what counts but the faction has not 
yet discussed the problem, Nutt said. 
  The parliamentary faction of the Fatherland Party made a 
statement later on Wednesday, saying that the proposition made 
by the emergency meeting of the board of the Fatherland Party, 
to the government to resign, came as a "surprise for the 
faction." The faction states that such propositions are not a 
matter of any party or its board -- the nomination and 
withdrawal of a government is, according to the constitution, in 
the parliament's authority. "The position of the Fatherland Part 
parliamentary faction is that the government has to continue its 
activities," the statement says. 
  The government is to hold an emergency meeting tonight.

  [Text] Tallinn May 18 TASS -- The Estonian Government went 
into an emergency meeting at 21:00 local time [1800 GMT] on 
Wednesday to consider the possibility of resignation. 
  A proposal to dissolve the current government and to form a 
new one was moved by the party Isamaa (Fatherland), the major 
one in the government coalition. 
  According to Defence Minister Indrek Kannik, the main reason 
for the cabinet's possible resignation is internal differences 
between government members. Kannik himself was asked a few 
hours before to step down as defence minister by Mart Laar, 
Estonia's prime minister and Isamaa leader.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Maloveryan] </F>
  [Text] Tallinn, 19 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The Mart Laar 
government is not going to resign. That is the outcome of an 
emergency session of the cabinet which went on through the 
night. The main reason for the resignation issue being put on 
the agenda is contradictions within the government and 
differences between the prime minister and certain Cabinet 
members. 
  The government crisis, which was smoldering like a fire 
under 
the ashes, flared up yesterday when it became known that the 
board of the ruling Fatherland [Isamaa] party decided to 
recommend the government's resignation. This decision was 
opposed by the parliamentary party and other members of the 
ruling coalition -- the National Independence Party and the 
Liberal Democrats. 
  The Cabinet will be continuing with different members. So 
far it is reliably known that Defense Minister Indrek Kannik has 
resigned -- at the prompting of the head of government -- as 
well as Justice Minister Kaido Kama, who decided to leave his 
post of his own volition. According to Kama, no fewer than five 
other ministers will be leaving the Cabinet. Social Affairs 
Minister Marju Lauristin believes this figure to be a little 
high.

Lenk from Tallinn on the government crisis in Estonia. 
Reception is good. 
  Lenk says: "Late in the evening the government gathered for 
an emergency closed sitting. I can tell you that at this moment 
the Fatherland Party government is still in power in Estonia. 
However, the party, which has been in power the past year and 
one-half, has an exceptionally low popularity level among the 
public. It has been reported that five ministers tendered their 
resignation at last nights meeting."

  [Text] Tallinn, May 18, BNS -- Estonian President Lennart 
Meri had a meeting on Tuesday [17 May] with U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of Defense Charles Freeman, on a visit to Estonia. 
  Also present at the meeting were U.S. Ambassador Robert C. 
Frasure, the commander in chief of the Estonian defense forces, 
Maj. Gen. Aleksander Einseln, senior officials from the Estonian 
Foreign and Defense Ministries. 
  Participants in the meeting contended that Estonia's joining 
with the NATO Partnership for Peace program as well as setting 
up the Baltic peacekeeping battalion are factors contributing to 
the security of the Baltic Sea region and integration of Estonia 
with the European security structures. The meeting also 
mentioned it as advisable to work out a joint program for 
training the Baltic peacekeeping force. 
  Freeman and the Estonian president spoke about U.S. 
financial 
and expert assistance for the dismantling of Russian nuclear 
reactors at the Paldiski base in Estonia. 
  President Meri and his wife, Helle Meri, gave a dinner in 
honor of the U.S. assistant secretary of defense later in the 
evening.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 18, BNS -- The United States supports 
the setting up of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion, Charles W. 
Freeman, U.S. assistant secretary of defense for issues of 
international security told Estonian leaders yesterday. 
  Washington will allocate up to 10 million dollars as support 
for the formation of the battalion, Estonian Defense Minister 
Indrek Kannik quoted Freeman as saying. 
  Freeman and Kannik also discussed the opportunities for 
military cooperation between Estonia and the United States, as 
well as their working closely under NATO's Partnership for Peace 
program. 
  The high Pentagon official had meetings today with President 
Lennart Meri, Foreign Minister Juri Luik, Defense Minister 
Indrek Kannik, the country's commander in chief, Aleksander 
Einseln, and members of the parliament's defense and foreign 
affairs commissions. 
  Freeman at a press conference later in the day said the 
United States has no plans to set up its military bases in the 
Baltics. He said such a prospect was rather unlikely at a time 
when America is cutting down the number of its bases abroad. 
This is not a political decision, but a purely realistic 
approach, he said. 
  While commenting on the Estonian-Russian relations, he said 
the Estonian Government is having at its disposal the 
possibilities to resolve the existing problems. Freeman said 
the U.S. Administration supports Estonia's position at the talks 
with Russia. 
  Russia ought to understand that Estonia stays in the center 
of attention of the U.S. President and the government, he said.

No. 95/94] 
  [Excerpts] There are no technical problems with the 
dismantling of the reactors in Paldiski, Energy Minister Arvo 
Niitenberg declared yesterday. He added that the Russian side 
has overpoliticised the issue and is using it to exert pressure 
on Estonia. 
  Niitenberg, who chairs a four-minister government 
commission, 
announced that another commission will be formed to coordinate 
Estonia's general activities in the liquidation of the Paldiski 
military base. Russia has not yet announced the starting date 
and wants to conclude a single agreement on the dismantling and 
the removal of nuclear fuel. [passage omitted] 
  Government representative Juri Tikk added that cases of 
arson 
have become frequent in Paldiski and three Russians suspected of 
attempted arson had been stopped at the Russian submariners' 
training centre last week. The arsonists generally attack 
buildings turned over to the Estonian authorities, Tikk added.

  [Text] Estonia Prime Minister Mart Laar has said he regrets 
Russia's refusal to take part in a round-table conference on 
stability in Europe to be held in Paris on May 26-27 together 
with the Baltic states. The reports on Russia's refusal were 
distributed by Reuters Tuesday with reference to Greek Minister 
for European Relations Theodoros Pangalos. 
  Laar told Interfax that Russia's step could be viewed as a 
diplomatic attack intended to obstruct Estonia's integration in 
such structures as the European Union, West European Union and 
NATO keeping it within the scope of its influence. Laar pointed 
to the support rendered by Western Europe to the Baltic States. 
France's proposal to discuss Baltic-Russian relations, in the 
first place border disputes and ethnic issues, and promote their 
rapid resolution at the Paris conference was another sign of 
this approach. 
  "Such a region-wide discussion could create a positive 
background for the resolution of such issues," Laar was quoted 
as saying. He hoped that Russia would change its position.

  [Text] Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar received Max van 
der Stoel, the CSCE High Commissioner for Ethnic Minorities, 
Wednesday [18 May]. 
  Laar told Interfax that he and van der Stoel discussed the 
application of the Foreigner Act in the country. Lack of 
progress in this field had come under criticism both in Estonia 
and abroad. In particular, the European Union had recently 
expressed its disappointment over delays with issuance of 
residence and work permits to foreigners. 
  Laar said that van der Stoel had expressed satisfaction over 
steps taken recently by government and parliament. In 
particular, the foreigners who had been registered as residents 
of the country before July 1, 1990, had been allowed to apply 
for a permanent permit simultaneously with an application for a 
temporary permit. Steps are taken to help the foreigners study 
the state language and obtain exit documents, Laar said.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 17, BNS -- The Estonian Cabinet at its 
meeting today approved a draft of amendments to the farm reform 
law. The step was made in a bid to prepare ground for a revision 
of the already enacted procedures in places where the government 
says the reform has meant unrightful transferring of former 
collective farm property to new owners. 
  The amendments bill now enters the parliament. 
  "This bill is very much needed, as it would provide the 
government with the possibility to `rewind' the farm reform in 
some places so that corrections could be made where misprision 
has been committed during the reform," Laar told reporters. 
  The prime minister said that although the farm reform had 
been carried out mostly in compliance with the law, in many 
cases the laws have failed to prevent malpractice. It is 
impossible to improve this under the current laws, he added. 
  Laar said that the draft legislation approved by the Cabinet 
today had been corrected for several times after examination by 
the Justice Ministry. 
  The Cabinet today also discussed a bill on the organization 
of the farm products market. "The government stated that, 
generally, such kind of a law is very much needed, but since it 
fails to properly comply with the rest of the currently valid 
legislation, it earned no positive assessment," Laar said. 
  The draft was prepared by the parliament's rural affairs 
commission. 
  The government now ordered the Ministry of Agriculture to 
draw up a new draft law on the same issues.

<F P=106> [Leonid Levitskiy report under the general heading </F>
"Lithuanian TV Companies Dreaming of Winning `Ostankino' 
Channel. Estonian TV Already Paying for Its Closure"] 
  [Text] Tallinn -- Under a government directive the 
retransmission in Estonia of the last Russian channel -- 
"Ostankino" -- has ended. The reason given for the ban is that 
Russia is not paying for its programs to be shown. But the 
victory over "Ostankino" has been very costly -- communications 
workers have lost their main source of funds. The government 
has had to allocate 1,580,000 krooni ($115,000) to meet the 
expenditure generated by the ending of Ostankino retransmissions. 
  The communications workers used to receive a much higher 
rental from Ostankino than they do from Estonian TV and local 
commercial TV firms. To all intents and purposes Russia had 
been subsidizing the local TV. 
  Having now lost their Ostankino hard currency, the 
communications workers have been forced to set realistic tariffs 
for state TV and commercial studios. But these are claiming 
that they are unable to pay in full. The government was then 
forced to provide compensation out of the budget for some of the 
former Ostankino subsidies. The Ostankino ban has hit the 
taxpayer.

met the Finnish premier, president, and parliament speaker. In 
their bilateral talks they touched on the questions of Finland's 
participation in the fund for Skrunda and the repatriation of 
retired Russian military personnel, Latvia's entry into the 
European Union, and issues of the two countries' economic 
cooperation. Valdis Birkavs also got acquainted with the work of 
the Finnish border guards. 
  [Begin Birkavs recording] We did not sign any agreements. 
Our relations have entered a period of active cooperation, and 
I would like to emphasize the words said by several Finnish 
statesmen: There is satisfaction with the current development of 
bilateral relations, with Latvia's progress toward the European 
Union, and with Latvia's action in concluding a treaty that has 
strengthened Latvia's position as an independent country in 
Europe. I think that after this visit, cooperation will be 
considerably activated in several directions. [end recording]

  [Text] Riga, May 18, BNS -- The Latvian Cabinet approved 
Tuesday [17 May] a bill on obligatory social insurance in the 
case of unemployment, stipulating to maintain the jobless from a 
special employment fund. 
  Both employers and employees must perform obligatory 
payments 
into the fund, under the draft law. 
  The state insures persons at its maintenance, including 
soldiers in armed service, days students over the age of 15, 
mothers with children under 3, and inmates of penitentiary 
institutions. 
  Persons, for whom the insurance payments have been made, are 
entitled to allowances for a period of nine months, according to 
the draft law. 
  The amount of the allowance depends on the amount of the 
recipient's average wages over the last six months, as well as 
on the length of insurance. For example, persons with insurance 
term of one to one and a half years will receive 50 percent of 
their average allowance in unemployment allowance. 
  The allowance payments also depend on the length of 
joblessness. The allowance is paid fully in the first three 
months after a person loses job. 
  Then it gradually reduces to 60 percent of the initial 
payment but the amount of money paid should not be smaller than 
90 percent of the official minimum wages. 
  State insured persons receive 70 percent of the official 
minimum wages in unemployment allowance, the bill said. 
  In another action, the government confirmed the statutes of 
a 
Social Insurance Council. The council is designed to draw up 
recommendations for insurance funds, Welfare Minister Janis 
Ritenis told reporters after the government meeting. 
  The council will consist of nine officials, from which three 
will represent employers, three -- employees and three -- the 
government. 
  Ritenis claims that the setup of the council will ensure the 
participation of employees, entrepreneurs and the government in 
the development of the social insurance system.

"Latvia"] 
  [Text] In his comments on a televised statement by Prime 
Minister Valdis Birkavs, Economic Reform Minister Ojar Kehris 
said that no ministerial changes have been officially discussed 
at the Latvian government. 
  The prime minister said in his statement on 15 May that the 
removal of ministers suspected of cooperating with the KGB would 
be the first step in reshuffling the Latvian Cabinet of 
Ministers. Kehris, in turn, stressed that the situation can be 
straightened out by the voluntary resignation of the ministers 
themselves. Valdis Birkavs pointed out that he will not discuss 
possible candidacies of new ministers as long as there is no 
legal basis to do so. Kehris said, however, that this could 
mean only a court ruling establishing the guilt of the suspected 
ministers, something that could serve as a reason for firing one 
minister and appointing another. 
  For the time being, Foreign Minister Georgs Andreyevs is on 
vacation, and Edvin Inkens, minister for special assignments, 
continues to go to work every day. (These two are "the main 
suspects.") It is known that Inkens is ready to be temporarily 
dismissed from office if Birkavs so requests. 
  The Cabinet of Ministers committee on economy and finances 
has opted against supporting the proposal made by the Prenex 
Anftalt firm for a second time to build a plan to incinerate 
hazardous wastes in Latvia. It is well known that at the 
beginning of March Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs signed a letter 
turning down the proposal; he explained that the Latvian 
government decided not to cooperate with the firm because 
bringing hazardous wastes into the country from abroad would run 
counter to the Latvian law banning hazardous wastes from 
entering Latvia. Minister Ojar Kehris said at a briefing that 
the committee on economy and finances recommended against 
accepting the firm's proposal because there is no sufficient 
information about the types of wastes Prenex Anftalt is going to 
bring into Latvia. The firm did not respond to repeated 
requests by the Environmental Protection Ministry that it 
provide appropriate documents. 
  In addition, the Basel conference [as published], which 
Latvia has also joined, specifies that as an exception a state 
could ask another state to accept wastes, but a firm cannot make 
such a request to another firm or a state. The project called 
for three incineration facilities to be built outside Riga to 
incinerate 300,000 tonnes of waste a year, including 210,000 
tonnes to be brought from EC countries and 90,000 tonnes of 
local wastes.

<F P=106> [Article by Baiba Melnace: "Government's Internal Debt Is </F>
Growing"] 
  [Text] Riga, 5 May -- Parliament has accepted amendments 
to the state budget law, which foresee a 41,253 million lat [Ls] 
increase in the maximum state internal debt. The amendments 
increase income by Ls18.15 million and expenditures by Ls21.44 
million. 
  The accepted amendments are connected mainly with children's 
benefits. Ls17.39 million have been earmarked for this purpose. 
Other big expenses (Ls4.8 million) are granted for the increase 
in the wages of the employees of state security institutions -- 
in the Ministries of Defense and Home Affairs, as well as in 
Home Guards and the Security Service. Part of the expenses are 
connected with the increase in the minimum wage from Ls15 to 
22.5, adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers. Colleges will 
receive an additional Ls220,000; health protection -- Ls201,000. 
Additional funds are allocated for orphanages, and centers for 
social aid and rehabilitation, but at the same time, funds are 
reduced for homes for the elderly and disabled, as well as for 
boarding-schools for disabled youth. 
  At the same time, there are plans to increase the budget by 
Ls9.18 million, preserving the same tax tariffs, but not 
foreseeing any reduced rates in this field. The government 
expects to gain Ls565,000 from the social tax payments, because 
the minimum wage has been raised and the minimum amount of 
tax-free duties has been reduced. It also expects to acquire 
Ls2.95 million from the budgets of towns and regions, and Ls5.44 
million from the joint stock company "Lata International" 
credit, and credit interest. 
  The Ls41.2 million growth of the state internal debt is 
connected with the Latvian Savings Bank and Latvian Universal 
Bank rehabilitation program. As State Budget Minister Janis 
Platais reported, government securities are to be issued in the 
amount of Ls57.5 million, which will be deposited in these 
banks. Simultaneously, the state internal debt, in the amount of 
Ls23.4 million, connected with the savings of the population, 
existing in the Savings Bank but not covered by assets, (the 
so-called lost Moscow assets, which until now have not been 
officially settled) is to be reduced. The government securities 
are supposed to yield a profit, and both banks will be able to 
recover, J. Platais said. 
  The state budget minister also said that the funds assigned 
for the rehabilitation of both banks will be returned to the 
state budget. The part of the state funds connected with the 
servicing of bad credits will be allotted to the banks on 
condition that the bad credits are repaid. In that case, the 
bank will keep 15 percent of the amount of the credit at its 
disposal, while 85 percent will be used to cancel the government 
securities. 
  The parliament accepted a total reduction of budget 
expenditures of Ls553.000, and an increase in expenses of 
Ls520,000. The cost of implementing the law on civil service, 
reform of the Ministry of Interior Affairs, and training of the 
State Reform Ministry clerks was reduced. As a result, 
additional funds were gained by State Land Service, cultural 
institutions, Central Elections Commission, Saeima, and the car 
service of the Saeima.

<F P=106> [Article by Nellija Locmele: "Program of Christian </F>
Democrats Emphasizes Protection of Human Life"] 
  [Text] Riga, 10 May -- Today, on the eve of municipal 
elections for the Riga City Council, the Union of Christian 
Democrats [KDS] presented the program it drafted with its 
coalition partner -- the League of Economic Activity [SRL]. The 
program consists of 14 parts and outlines plans for the coming 
three years. 
  At a press conference, KDS Deputy Chairman Maris Vitols 
referred to the program as the basis for KDS and SRL political 
cooperation: We believe not only in God, but also in each other. 
Vice President of SRL Ojars Blumbergs assessed the cooperation 
as real and fruitful. 
  The priorities of the program are social protection and 
health protection, which together help secure human life. In 
this domain, KDS and SRL make promises that one cannot find in 
other parties' programs -- unemployed people will receive 
additional payments in the amount of 50 percent of their 
unemployment benefit for working on social jobs (repairing 
streets, roofs, etc.); by concluding contracts with local 
authorities, social aid centers will be created in the 
countryside, which in turn will offer seasonal jobs to local 
inhabitants; humane conditions will be ensured in Riga mental 
hospitals. KDS states directly what the often-mentioned 
reorganization of municipal authority should look like -- it 
should become centralized, subordinated to the city mayor (in 
the sense of political responsibility), and specialized in three 
directions -- securing order in the streets, market places, and 
municipal premises. It is also foreseen to create a department 
of secret police, to fight gangs, corruption, and robberies. 
KDS also promises to carry out, in a few weeks' time, a listing 
of city housing funds and to determine the number of inhabitants 
living in unsanitary conditions, to whom unoccupied flats should 
be granted. There is also a project to cancel the zone-based 
ticket system in the Riga city transport, and return to two 
radial tramlines on both banks of Daugava, for the convenience 
of passengers. KDS also proposes to earmark one part of the 
excise tax for the needs of the city -- for transportation and 
for fighting air pollution. In the realm of privatization, KDS 
is of the opinion that the most optimal variant would be an open 
"court of interests," in which lawyers representing the 
interests of the town, environment and inhabitants employment 
would take part. [sentence as published]

  [Text] Riga, May 18, BNS -- A recent inspection revealed 
major financial irregularities in the Latvian Immigration and 
Citizenship Department, Interior Ministry's officials told BNS. 
  The department faced a complete audit of financially 
economic 
activities for a three-year period, said Arturs Berzins, head of 
the ministry's Control and Revision Commission. 
  The department's wages fund was exceeded 5,479 lats in 1993. 
In addition, 14,872 lats were paid in bonuses and social 
benefits, the commission said. 
  Then-Director Maris Plavnieks also ungroundedly spent budget 
resources on insurance of department's employees for more that 
46,000 U.S. dollars. The money was transferred to the 
Austria-based Save-Invest firm, which lacked license to operate 
in Latvia. 
  The insurance deal was one of the sidesteppings for which 
Plavnieks was fired Dec. 14, 1993. 
  The department wired the money without concluding any 
contracts. The only documents to confirm the deal are insurance 
policies. 
  The ministry will try to recover the money, if necessary, 
with a help by the Economic Court, said Interior Ministry's 
Janis Balins. 
  In addition, the department lacks any form of internal 
control, like proper accounting and stock taking. 
  Plavnieks told reporters that the wages fund was overdrafted 
to keep qualified employees from moving to better paid jobs. 
  Speaking on the controversial insurance deal, Plavnieks said 
that Save-Invest was only a mediator firm but the insuring was 
done on highly favorable terms in the Fortuna firm, which is, in 
his words, one of the 12 largest insurance companies worldwide. 
  Ints Zitars currently performs the duties of the 
department's 
acting director.

<F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Krinitskiy, expert of the State Duma </F>
Committee for CIS Affairs and Ties With Compatriots, under 
"Authority" rubric: "A New Parliament -- a New Course? What 
Russian Parliamentarians Observing Conduct of Ukrainian 
Elections Saw"] 
  [Text] The work of the first session of the new Ukrainian 
Supreme Council, which has just been formed has started in Kiev. 
Over 500 international observers monitored the conduct of the 
early elections that took place. They represented the United 
Nations, the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly, the Council of Europe, 
the European Parliament, NATO, other organizations, and 
individual countries. Our compatriots were also among them. 
  A Russian delegation of eight deputies from various factions 
and the same number of State Duma experts observed the conduct 
of the Ukrainian Supreme Council elections. It was headed by 
Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Committee for CIS Affairs 
and Ties With Compatriots. The Russian parliamentarians worked 
in Kiev, Donetsk, Kharkov, Simferopol, Odessa, Lvov, and 
Uzhgorod. 
  Our observers did not discover any serious violations 
capable 
of influencing the outcome of the elections and about which the 
Russian and world communities should have been warned. For them 
it was not such an important task to keep an eye on the ballot 
boxes. The Russian parliamentarians' aim was to get the feel of 
the Ukrainian political situation and, based on the experience 
gained, dealings with voters, and conversations with state and 
political leaders with diverse views, to help the State Duma 
establish a line of conduct and recommend a particular political 
course in Russian-Ukrainian relations. 
  One of the Russian parliamentarians' main conclusions was 
that the Ukrainian elections did not take place in conditions of 
an acute socioeconomic crisis, which is so painfully familiar to 
us. Accordingly, both the first and second rounds of voting were 
won by candidates whose platforms were based on severe criticism 
of the old nomenklatura-bureaucratic regime and on promises to 
conduct a resolute struggle against social injustice and 
corruption in power structures in order to improve the people's 
lives and punish the guilty in the country's present grave 
situation; on promises to get away from the extremes of the 
epoch of fighting for sovereignty and absolute independence and 
to restore and strengthen trade and economic relations with 
Russia and the CIS as a whole. 
  A characteristic feature of the elections that were held was 
that both rounds of voting, like the recent Russian elections, 
showed the complete groundlessness of apparently irrefutable 
predictions and easily destroyed the myths being persistently 
inculcated into people's consciousness. 
  The main result and the first surprise to lovers of 
predictions was that the first round of elections was valid 
everywhere. While the second round provided the necessary 
number of people's deputies (this is precisely what they are 
still called in Ukraine). Of the 450 seats in parliament 338 
have been filled, which by law enables it to start full-scale 
work. The 112 vacant seats will be filled after repeat 
elections, which are due to take place in two months. 
  Voters turned out and dispelled the myth of the Ukrainian 
people's absolute passivity. To the surprise of many and even 
to the confusion of some, three-fourths of the country's 
citizens expressed their attitude to the candidates. As early 
as the first round yet another prediction -- about the clear 
domination of voters' centrist sentiments -- was dispelled. 
Centrist reformers, as in Russia recently, definitely did not 
achieve their expected success. Although Leonid Kuchma, 
Vladimir Lanovoy, and Sergey Golovatyy, their leaders from the 
interregional bloc for reforms, won convincingly in the first 
round, this was exclusively through their very high personal 
ratings. After all, even Stepan Khmara, the odious 
national-radical and leader of the Ukrainian Conservative 
Republican Party (he is being called the Ukrainian 
Zhirinovskiy), also won easily in the first round. Petr 
Simonenko and Aleksandr Moroz, leaders of the Communist Party 
and the Socialist Party, also won outright. 
  In general, contrary to all forecasts (the analogy with our 
elections again comes to mind) left-wing forces achieved 
undoubted success. Moreover, their lead over the other parties 
is very substantial. Thus, around half of the 338 elected 
deputies consider themselves to be independent, that is to say 
nonparty. Of the remainder, the Communists obtained 86 seats 
and their allies -- the Socialist Party and the Peasant Party -- 
another 32 seats. Next comes the "Ukraina" bloc of 
national-democratic parties, dominated by Rukh, and after that 
the placemen of ruling structures or the "parties of power," as 
they are called, and only then the centrists and 
radical-nationalists. Yet another myth was shattered. Prior to 
the start of the election race the local press marked down the 
"government parties" (several of them under various names) as 
supposed favorites and themselves maintained this myth. But 
now, having suffered an obvious lack of success, their leaders 
are stating that it is not a defeat but a retreat to previously 
prepared positions. Observers believe that this is simply an 
attempt to "make the best of a bad situation." 
  At the same time the definite successes of highly extreme 
forces in the western oblasts are sounding the warning bells. 
Thus, UNA-UNSD (Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian National 
Self-Defense) have gotten three of their leaders into 
parliament. Generally the rivalry among among a multitude of 
right-wing nationalist organizations and movement was won by the 
Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists. It obtained a total of 23 
seats. 
  Admittedly it is still premature to make a final count. The 
percentage of "independent" deputies is too great. It cannot be 
ruled out that many of them will change their political 
orientation inside parliament. A more precise disposition of 
political forces can be determined only some time after the 
Supreme Council has started its work, when deputies' factions 
will be formed finally. It should not be forgotten that in the 
initial stages of the election campaign most candidates called 
themselves "independent" and it was only later, sensing that 
"one man does not make an army," that many of them took seats on 
a party platform of some kind. Not for nothing do most 
observers claim that, despite the absence of voting according to 
party lists, what took place in Ukraine was a multiparty 
election under a majority system. Incidentally, members of 39 
registered parties and associations with an extremely diverse 
spectrum of convictions and platforms started the election 
marathon. 
  Still, our observers have no doubt that the vector of public 
sentiments in Ukraine is obviously moving in a pro-Russian 
direction. This is not a speculative claim; the fact was 
confirmed beyond doubt by a Ukrainian national poll. Russia's 
position must be aimed at strengthening ties with Ukraine, but 
without harming its national and state dignity, on the basis of 
mutual respect and advantage.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rukh Chairman Vyacheslaw Chornovil by </F>
Lyudmyla Kokhanets; place and date not given: "We Agree With 
Bolshevik Ulyanov: There Should Be Less Political Idle Talk"] 
  [Text] [Kokhanets] Mr. Chornovil, the election results 
confirmed that only two parties, two political forces, were able 
to usher into the parliament a number of their representatives, 
which allows them to form factions on a strict party basis. 
These are the Communist Party and Rukh. 
  [Chornovil] So we have. Our faction is currently comprised 
of 30 people -- members and supporters of Rukh. Several other 
deputies, representatives of parties with opinions close to 
ours, intend to join us. Other factions, unfortunately, are not 
being formed on a party basis. "Unfortunately," because this 
will not allow the parliament to be clearly structured. We 
should aim at the European model of parliamentarism with its 
faction discipline and clear division on the authorities and the 
opposition. Although this will not take place, the first step 
in this direction has already been taken. 
  [Kokhanets] I recall that, while discussing the electoral 
law, the majority of speakers complained: "What parties? 
People are already allergic to the word `party'..." 
  [Chornovil] Yes, the law proved to be completely antiparty, 
but it was corrected by the voters themselves, because they 
generally voted for certain political forces, not individuals. 
It is significant that people want these forces to assume 
responsibility; they do not want everyone be responsible for 
themselves. Thus, we have our faction, and we have already held 
an organizational meeting. According to our statute, the Rukh 
chairman is the faction head, Rukh Deputy Chairman Oleksandr 
Lavrynovych is its coordinator, and Rivne People's Deputy 
Volodymyr Kovtunets is the secretary. 
  [Kokhanets] Will the program with which your faction is 
going to the parliament not duplicate the Rukh program? 
  [Chornovil] What the faction will propose to the parliament 
is not a party program. However, it is actually a little bit 
easier for us, because we do not have to think over new things: 
We have a well developed state-building concept, which was 
elaborated by a large group of scientists and adopted as early 
as at the Fourth Rukh Congress. So far, no political force has 
elaborated such a document. 
  [Kokhanets] Do you believe that the current alignment of 
forces in the parliament will ensure its ability to act? 
  [Chornovil] Those who claim that the new parliament is worse 
than the previous one do not tell the truth. It is not worse. 
Its problem is that it is incomplete. The current Supreme 
Council, first of all, is more structured; second, it is not 
dominated by the extreme left-wing forces, about which there was 
a lot of talk on the eve of the elections. By the way, there 
are many sober-minded people who are willing to cooperate among 
leftists. For example, I have heard an opinion among socialists 
that the parliamentary work should not be politicized from its 
first days. The Rukh faction advocates exactly the same thing. 
We agree with Bolshevik Ulyanov that there should be less 
political idle talk. God forbid that we become stuck in a 
debate over symbols, anthems, or state languages. This will 
allow us neither to form a normal government and Supreme Council 
working bodies, nor to resolve urgent economic problems. I am 
very afraid of such politicizing. Perhaps we should first 
convene the leaders of all factions -- starting with those 
ranging from the extreme left to the center-right (since extreme 
rightists will hardly be able to establish their own faction). 
We must reach an agreement and prevent debates on certain 
issues, on which we will inevitably disagree, and we will again 
irritate the Ukrainian people with our senseless conflicts. I 
think that we all must agree on vital questions: How to improve 
the economy, implement market mechanisms, and curb the crime 
raise and impoverishment of society. Another urgent problem is 
the financial reform. Mr. Zvyahilskyy [acting prime minister], 
apparently, has not done his job.... 
  However, I am afraid that the parliament's incompleteness 
can 
hamper our resolutions of vital issues. For example, what to do 
with the elections scheduled for 26 June? A working group, in 
which I am participating, has recently come forward with 
amendments to the Constitution, without which the elections 
cannot be held, since the Electoral Law says one thing, and the 
Constitution -- another. According to the latter, we have no 
right to hold either the presidential or self-government 
elections. It must be precisely defined what kind of 
presidential or local authority there will be, and only then we 
can go to the polls. 
  As for the parliament's structure, I think that the center 
comprising predominantly nonparty people will have an impact on 
many things. Leftist forces have approximately a third of 
seats, national-democratic forces -- even less. Therefore, 
while making decisions on a majority of issues, every faction 
will be trying to win support of the center which has gathered 
representatives of the party in power, agriculture sector 
officials, entrepreneurs, and servicemen. 
  [Kokhanets] Who, do you think, threatens Ukrainian statehood 
more -- extreme leftists or the interregional bloc? 
  [Chornovil] The interregional bloc, of course. Supporters 
of Mr. Kuchma advocate things that unequivocally threaten our 
independence. Fortunately, they won very few votes. I do not 
know whether the bloc members will try to form a faction; they 
do not have even 12 deputies: They won some votes in Kharkov 
Oblast and Dnepr region; in Donbass, they were defeated by the 
communists. As for the extreme leftists, we suppose that they 
are not in agreement either. Among them are forces which, 
according to socialist recipes, want to build a Ukrainian state. 
We will be looking for a common language with them: We will be 
trying to convince them, or to make certain compromises. Of 
course, compromises will be out of the question if we see an 
open proimperial mood. We expect, however, that there will not 
be many such deputies in the new parliament. 
  [Kokhanets] What will be your party position in the 
presidential elections? 
  [Chornovil] We will coordinate who will be nominated and 
registered. It is not so easy to collect 100,000 signatures. 
Rukh has not officially nominated any candidate. Perhaps we 
will unofficially support Lanovyy. He really is a serious 
economist, a man who stands on state-building positions and can 
strip the proimperially oriented Kuchma of some votes. Yet, the 
point is not Kuchma himself, but the forces which bet on him, 
intending to command their nominee if he is elected to 
presidential office. 
  [Kokhanets] Thus, we will not see your name among 
presidential candidates this time. People say that 
Chornovil-oppositionist can do more than Chornovil-president. 
What is your opinion about such a "compliment?" 
  [Chornovil] I am not focused on being an oppositionist. I 
simply consider these elections immoral. Even the situation 
surrounding them is somewhat unpleasant. Look, this is our 
president who states either that he will no longer run for his 
current office, or that he will. [Former Supreme Council 
Chairman] Plyushch has also put forward his candidacy, and he is 
arguing at news conferences that Leonid Makarovych, to put it 
politely, is not right.... They are simply fighting for the 
chair, not knowing how will it look, since the president's 
functions have not been defined, nor has the new constitution 
been adopted. Where in the world is a president elected first, 
and then his functions defined? This does not occur. This 
drive to the chair, this intriguing against one another, this 
coquetry, all this is very shameful. Most candidates are not 
any better, either. Do these people really not realize that 
they are ridiculous in their claims to the presidential office. 
You know, watching such an atmosphere, I am only glad that I 
have not joined this game. Of course, if there were a different 
configuration of forces, a different situation within society, 
why could not Rukh recommend its own representative? Regarding 
that "compliment," I believe that I was governing Lvov Oblast 
rather well, when I was openly not in the opposition. The 
general situation was simply unfavorable for my work. The 
economic collapse began at that time. We were trying to prevent 
it, as much as we could. We achieved a lot, but.... 
  I would like to emphasize again that opposition is not the 
goal for me or our faction. If a political force only aims at 
being in the opposition, it is doomed. Pure opposition does not 
exist in politics. Thus, the opinion that "Chornovil is an 
eternal oppositionist" is rather false. The current situation 
simply gives us no chance to win more than we could win. 
  [Kokhanets] How, in your opinion, can Rukh's victory and the 
defeat of the Ukrainian Republican Party [URP] be explained? 
  [Chornovil] I think that the URP leaders' policy is too 
temporizing, not only toward Kravchuk, but also his 
nomenklatura. They recklessly believed that the old team would 
honestly build a new state. Recklessness does not work out in 
politics... And Rukh... Rukh was successful, because it 
understands this. 
  We expect that our faction will become more solid after the 
run-off elections, since in many constituencies where the 
elections were disrupted we had a very good chance; our 
representatives made it to the second round not only in western 
Ukraine, but also in eastern oblasts (in Kiev, for example, -- 
14 "pure" Rukh members). 
  Our faction is ready for the parliamentary work. It will 
cooperate with all who want to make our Ukraine an independent 
and developed state.

Federation Defense Ministry between Major General Sergey

ecology and special protection funds directorate, and European 
Parliament deputies Christian Rousing and Freddy Blak. The 
visitors from Denmark saw for themselves how the storing and 
utilization of nuclear weapons and propulsion plants in the Army 
and the Navy is done by experienced specialists with the aid of 
the most up-to-date technical monitoring equipment. However, due 
to considerable cuts in nuclear arms and redeployment of missile 
units there is a lack of ecology specialists. The 
Europarliament deputies voiced readiness for cooperation in 
jointly training them.

  [Text] The press service of the Ukrainian president and 
Cabinet of Ministers has issued a statement on the situation in 
Crimea. Here is the text: 
  The latest events in Crimea, the statements and practical 
steps by officials of the Republic of Crimea, cause concern in 
Ukraine and in international circles because of the possibility 
of a sharp exacerbation of the sociopolitical situation on the 
peninsula, the creation in the center of Europe of a hotbed of 
danger, and instability. 
  The new leadership of the autonomy has gone from a 
declaration of intent to concrete actions aimed at changing the 
legal status of the autonomous republic of Crimea as a 
constituent part of Ukraine. In particular, it has become known 
that a regular meeting of the Crimean Supreme Council plans to 
discuss the issue on returning to individual provisions of the 6 
May 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Crimea, which 
contravenes the Constitution of Ukraine and which were changed 
by the Supreme Council of Crimea itself in September 1992. At 
the same time there is an attempt to carry out the current 
constitution of the Republic of Crimea and to create the basis 
for Crimea's secession from Ukraine which would be a blatant 
violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity. 
  Attempts by the leadership of the Republic of Crimea to 
legally introduce its own citizenship, to create its own 
military formations, and to change the status of Sevastopol 
cause concern. All of this contravenes the Constitution and the 
laws of Ukraine and the generally recognized principles of 
international law. The ambitious attempts by individual Crimean 
politicians also go against the goodwill of Ukraine to 
contribute to Crimea's all-round social, economic, and cultural 
development. The Supreme Council of Ukraine itself gave the 
Crimean oblast the status of an autonomous republic within the 
composition of Ukraine. It adopted a law of Ukraine on the 
delimitation of powers between the bodies of power of Ukraine 
and the Republic of Crimea. The president of Ukraine adopted a 
law on an open economy regime on the territory of the Republic 
of Crimea. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers regulated, 
together with the Crimean Government, issues of ownership, 
formulation of the budget, and carried out a number of measures 
to stabilize the economy in the Republic of Crimea. Ukraine is 
genuinely carrying out a policy of renewing historical justice 
with regard to the deported peoples and is contributing to the 
return of the Crimean Tatar people to their historical homeland. 
  Crimea is and will remain a part of Ukraine, says the 
Ukranian president's statement. However, instead of fully 
exploiting the given opportunities to pull Crimea's economy out 
of the crisis situation, certain political circles in the 
autonomous republic have recently adopted a different course. 
There is open speculation on the economic difficulties that 
Ukraine as well as other CIS countries are suffering today, even 
though in such difficult conditions Ukraine has, to a 
considerable extent, found the possibility to cover Crimea's 
deficit in financial and material resources. Despite these 
objective realities, anti-Ukrainian and antistate feelings are 
constantly being stirred up among the population of Crimea. 
Facts prove that dangerous processes in the Republic of Crimea 
do not have an exclusively internal Crimean origin but to a 
considerable extent are stimulated by individual political 
forces in Russia, whose actions have recently taken on signs of 
open interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine. 
  In accordance with the Constitution and current Ukrainian 
legislation, the Republic of Crimea is an autonomous and 
constituent part of Ukraine which has wide powers in the 
economic sphere, makes use of the natural wealth, ecology, 
culture, and organizes community life. The Republic of Crimea, 
as an autonomous and constituent part of Ukraine, is not a 
bearer of state sovereignty and cannot enter into political 
relations with foreign states. The validity of the Constitution 
of Ukraine extends over the whole territory of Ukraine, 
including Crimea. The territory of Ukraine is single, 
indivisible, inviolable, and complete. Crimea cannot have its 
own citizenship which is separate from Ukraine. Citizens of the 
Republic of Crimea are citizens of Ukraine. The autonomy may 
not have its own armed forces. 
  The press service of the president and the Cabinet of 
Ministers of Ukraine is authorized to state that all necessary 
measures will be adopted by the Ukrainian president and the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine to stabilize the political situation 
in Crimea and to guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity. The 
president of Ukraine will ensure absolute adherence to the 
constitution and laws of Ukraine on the entire territory of the 
state, including Crimea as a constituent part of Ukraine. 
  The press service of the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet 
of Ministers of Ukraine notes that some political and public 
figures of Russia are violating the rules and norms of behavior 
on the territory of another state. In connection with this, in 
the future, any attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of 
Ukraine will be resolutely stopped in accordance with Ukraine's 
legislation.

  [Text] Acting Internal Minister of the Crimea, Valeriy 
Kuznetsov, said in the morning of May 19 in an address to the 
session of the Crimean parliament in Simferopol that a coup had 
been attempted in Crimea last night. 
  He said that Deputy Ukrainian Internal Minister Valentin 
Nedrihaylo had arrived in Simferopol at night. He was 
accompanied by a group of 15 special policemen. Nedrigailo read 
out to the personnel of the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry 
the decree issued by Ukrainian President on May 18, 1994 to 
reorganize the Ministry and create on its basis a department of 
the internal affairs of the Crimea which would be subordinate to 
the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. 
  In connection with this Valeriy Kuznetsov demanded from 
parliament that deputies immediately approve him as the Crimean 
Minister. 
  An interval was announced at the parliament session. 
Deputies are waiting for the arrival of the parliament's 
defense commission which is to clarify these events. 
  Kuznetsov was appointed acting Interior Minister of the 
Crimea a month ago by the decree of president Yuriy Meshkov.

  [Text] Simferopol [no date as received] -- During the 
discussion of the agenda at the Crimean Supreme Council's 
session today, Yuriy Meshkov, the republic's president, proposed 
that the composition of the government should be approved 
immediately. He then interrupted his speech to give the floor 
to Crimea's acting internal affairs minister, General Valeriy 
Kuznetsov. The latter announced, in particular, that "a plane 
with Ukrainian First Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Valentin 
Nedryhaylo and special forces [spetsnaz] on board secretly 
arrived in Simferopol in the early hours [on 19 May]. A 
surprise attempt to seize the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry 
building was made right away. That attempt was barred by 
resolute actions by the personnel of the Crimean militia. A 
military coup is under way." In Valeriy Kuznetsov's words, 
Valentin Nedryhaylo tried to read to the militia personnel a 
Ukrainian presidential directive dismissing the leadership of 
the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry, appointing "Kiev 
governors" and subordinating the Crimean Internal Affairs 
Ministry to the Ukrainian president, bypassing the Crimean 
Supreme Council and president. 
  It was proposed at the session that Valeriy Kuznetsov's 
candidacy for the post of Crimean internal affairs minister 
should be approved urgently and even without any discussion, but 
because of the [Crimean Tartar People] Kurultay group's 
disagreement this proposal was not passed. A commission was set 
up in order to verify Valeriy Kuznetsov's report. The Crimean 
Supreme Council's commission for military issues and the 
Republic of Crimea's security, and the republic's procurator are 
members of the commission. The deputies discussed the candidacy 
of Valeriy Kuznetsov for the post of Crimean internal affairs 
minister. Voting on his candidacy was postponed until the 
commission completes its work. 
  The president of the Crimean Republic proposed that the 
session should consider and approve a resolution in reaction to 
the Ukrainian president's decree "On converting the Crimean 
Republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Ukrainian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs main directorate for internal 
affairs in Crimea", as well as approve the composition of a 
coordinating commission formed by the government to go to Kiev 
for negotiations on cooperation and delimitation of powers in 
disputed policy areas. Yuriy Meshkov also proposed the 
immediate approval of two more appointments, the heads of the 
Crimean security service and the Justice Ministry. According to 
the Crimean president, while the Ukrainian leadership continues 
its attempts to destabilize the situation in Crimea to help 
Leonid Kravchuk hold on to the presidential seat, there is no 
other option than to approve the ministerial appointments to 
preserve stability on the peninsula. 
  Valeriy Kartavtsev, head of the Ukrainian Security Council 
Secretariat, told UNIAN that a meeting of the Council on 18 May 
discussed the issue of Ukraine's territorial integrity following 
the latest developments in Crimea. In his opinion, the 
Ukrainian president and the newly elected Supreme Council can be 
expected to take action if the violation of Ukraine's 
Constitution continues. Militia Colonel-General Valentin 
Nedryhaylo, first deputy minister of internal affairs, flew to 
Crimea after the Security Council meeting. 
  According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs' 
main 
center for public links, on 19 May at the Crimean Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, the results were summed up on the granting of 
practical assistance by the bodies and subunits of Crimea's 
internal affairs to officials from Ukraine's Ministry of 
Internal Affairs. Militia Col-Gen Valentin Nedryhaylo, first 
deputy minister of Ukraine's internal affairs, took part in the 
summing up. He read a decree of the Ukrainian president to the 
leadership of Crimea's Ministry of Internal Affairs, "On 
reorganizing the ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of 
Crimea into a chief directorate of internal affairs of Crimea of 
Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs and on subordinating this 
directorate directly to Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs." 
  In accordance with this decree, administrative and 
management 
buildings, armaments, means of transportation, and other assets 
are transferred for use by the chief directorate of internal 
affairs of Crimea. The additional post of deputy minister of 
Ukraine's internal affairs -- head of the main directorate of 
internal affairs of Crimea of Ukraine's Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, is being introduced to the staff of the central 
apparatus of Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs. Militia 
Colonel V. Chernyshov [name as received] was appointed to this 
post. 
  The main center for public links of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs of Ukraine also announced that a statement from Valeriy 
Kuznetsov, acting internal affairs minister of the Republic of 
Crimea, about an attempt by spetsnaz to seize the Crimean 
Ministry of Internal Affairs building was "another attempt to 
deceive the public of Crimea and Ukraine."

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- A contingent of Ukrainian home 
guards and special forces numbering 1,000 was dispatched to the 
Crimea over the past 24 hours, ITAR-TASS learnt on Thursday from 
sources close to the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet.

  [Text] Moscow, 19 May -- New information about a 
concentration of Ukrainian troops on the Crimean peninsula 
reached ITAR-TASS this afternoon. 
  The agency has learned from sources at the headquarters of 
the Black Sea Fleet that special-purpose units which may be used 
to seize Black Sea Fleet units deployed in the port of Izmail 
are being concentrated around the town of Izmail. 
  According to the same reports, a Ukrainian armed forces 
military field hospital is being set up in the village of 
Chernobayevka in Kherson Oblast. Those working there, the same 
sources reported, apparently do not conceal from the local 
people that they are preparing to receive wounded people from 
Crimea in the near future.

  [Text] Simferopol -- On 17 May, Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov held a news conference on the completion of 100 days of 
his presidency. He believes that, in his words, his least 
successful day was when he was "stabbed in the back," i.e. when 
the Ukrainian president appointed his representative to Crimea. 
If Leonid Kravchuk does listen to opposition and introduce 
presidential rule after all, in Yuriy Meshkov's view, he will 
violate the constitution and laws of Ukraine, "Which violations 
have become a tradition for the current leadership of Ukraine." 
  Relations between official Kiev and official Simferopol, the 
Crimean president said, must be different from what they have 
been up until recently. "Yukhym Zvyahilskyy's visit has changed 
the climate of these mutual relations and confirmed that the 
influence of the forces of reason in Ukraine is quite strong, 
and it is they who will determine the state's domestic and 
foreign policy."

<F P=106> [Report by Larisa Troyan: "Yuriy Meshkov on the Phone: `I </F>
Did Not Need To Be Too Rigid'"] 
  [Text] The somewhat mysterious and "incomplete" character 
of the 7 May closed-door meeting in the Crimea between Ukraine's 
acting Prime Minister Yu. Zvyahilskyy on one side and Crimean 
President Yu. Meshkov, Deputy Prime Minister Ye. Saburov, and V. 
Minin, minister-chief of the State Affairs Service on the other, 
made those reporters who attended them, shrug their shoulders 
helplessly. The latter failed to learn anything concrete, even 
at the news conference held to review the results of the talks. 
  Given that a KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI correspondent was not on 
Yu. Zvyahilskyy's team, we had no other choice than to place a 
telephone call directly to Yu. Meshkov. It was not easy to get 
through. Meshkov spoke leniently and politely, but was as 
taciturn as ever. He confirmed that in the spotlight had been 
the issues of Crimea's economic independence, adding: "We tried 
to remove the air of mutual distrust, although it was not my or 
Yukhym Leonidovych's fault that such distrust existed." The 
negotiations were held in a friendly atmosphere and, as was 
underlined by Meshkov, Zvyahilskyy had demonstrated a desire to 
understand the Crimean side's stance. Meshkov added: "Under 
those circumstances, as you understand, I did not find it 
necessary to be excessively firm." Not without content he 
mentioned that relations between Kiev and Crimea, or rather the 
Ukrainian and Crimean Governments, are entering the sphere of 
normality and "taking an acceptable course." 
  I asked from what angle President Meshkov's notorious 
decrees 
had been discussed -- the ones that practically declared Crimea 
a free economic zone. The Crimean president assured me that 
Zvyahilskyy had not dictated anything or exerted any kind of 
pressure. It should rather be said that there had been a quite 
reasonable desire to coordinate ways to resolve common problems. 
  Summing up what was said by President Meshkov, the meeting 
gave the two sides satisfaction and hope for further 
understanding. 
  What has changed in Crimea since the adoption of the 
economic 
decrees? According to Meshkov, business circles of Ukraine, 
especially its eastern regions, as well as other former USSR 
republics, and foreign countries have dramatically increased 
their interest in Crimea. There have been attractive proposals 
on the part of large firms from Japan, Korea, the United States, 
Austria, Germany, France, and other countries. 
  Why has the process of privatizing land been discontinued in 
Crimea? Meshkov answered that land in Crimea is much more 
valuable than in other regions: "One cannot treat a fine-wooled 
lamb and a lousy sheep in the same way. Once land prices are 
brought in line with world standards, we will carry out 
privatization." This sounds logical!

<F P=106> [Olga Musafirova report under the rubric "Parliamentary High </F>
Emotion": "Red Renaissance Advances in Free Ukraine"] 
  [Text] The opening of the new parliamentary session was 
honored by the presence of the president. Dressed in a white 
suit and looking very anxious, he did not congratulate the newly 
elected deputies on the start of their work -- a rare, even 
unique case in world practice of breaching the civilities of 
protocol. 
  Instead, President Kravchuk conveyed a special message to 
the 
Supreme Council. 
  The president demanded that they deal with him precisely in 
accordance with the law. Otherwise -- and Leonid Makarovich 
remains opposed to an early presidential election in June 
despite the lists of signatures of 100,000 supporters from 
various oblasts of Ukraine essential for his participation in 
the procedure -- as the message said, there could simply be 
"confrontation, with serious consequences putting peace in 
Ukraine at risk." Is it necessary to specify that the prepared 
documents demanded by Kravchuk -- a law on the status of the 
president and a new constitution -- do dot actually exist? 
  This kind of crisis has a long history and indeed was one of 
the reasons for the premature relinquishment of deputies' seats. 
The kolkhoz chairmen, long-standing dissidents, party 
secretaries, and poets who declared Ukraine's independence on 1 
December 1990 were able to do a lot, but they failed in the 
fundamental job of creating a rational legislative basis for the 
sovereign state. They hoped to be replaced by the professionals 
of the "state renaissance" stage, whose advent the president 
referred to several times -- liberal, market-oriented lawyers 
and jurists would arrive and parliament would at last be abuzz 
with the sound of intellectual labor. However, the election 
law, which again assigned the major role in nominating 
candidates to labor collectives rather than parties, led to a 
quite different work force in the Supreme Council -- a big 
contingent of pro-communist engineers and technical personnel. 
  It was no wonder that Aleksandr Moroz, chairman of the 
Socialist Party of Ukraine Political Council (he is down to 
become speaker, but Moroz himself hopes to become president in 
June), should make clear promises at a May Day rally, as scarlet 
banners flapped in the breeze: "We must change the authorities 
in the state! We must adopt a law to ensure that the president 
is elected in the Supreme Council rather than by direct ballot!" 
Party discipline is a daunting thing, especially when one in 
five of the people's elected representatives is a Communist. 
  Deputies were given a 1 July deadline to clarify their 
working relationship with the Supreme Council (the majority want 
to retain their posts and salaries at local level). If by 1 
July the country sees the advent of socialism at working people' 
request, such job-sharing will become feasible. 
  But for the time being everything is taking its own course. 
President Kravchuk has flown to Donetsk in the hope of winning 
round the miners. They once insisted on an early presidential 
election and consequently could do the same again. Many 
ministers, including the acting premier, have moved from the 
government benches in parliament to sit in the body of the hall 
as ordinary deputies. 
  In a country where laws have an arbitrary interpretation, 
only one, unwritten, law is operating smoothly: The ladies and 
gentlemen are unfailingly turning themselves into comrades...

session, chaired by Interim Presidium Chairman Petro Symoneko; 
voting for Supreme Council Chairman led by Mykhaylo Syrota, 
chairman of the Counting Commission -- live] 
  [Text] [Syrota] Esteemed members of the Presidium, esteemed 
people's deputies. Let me read out the protocol of the Supreme 
Council counting commission: Protocol No. 6. The sitting of the 
Supreme Council commission of 18 May 1994. Present are: 
  Mykhaylo Syrota, chairman of the Counting Commission;

Commission;

Ratushnyy, Oleksiy Berezhnyy, Oleksandr Yelyashkevych, Yuriy 
Buzduhan, Symonenko, and Mykola Horbatyuk. 
  Heard: on the results of the secret ballot for the election 
of the chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. 
  People's deputies of Ukraine Vasyl Vasylyovych Durdynets, 
Oleksandr Mykolayovych Karpov, Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz, 
and Yuriy Kazymyrovych Tyma were entered in the secret ballot 
paper for the election of the chairman of the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine. 
  Proceeding from the results of the secret ballot the 
Counting 
Commission has determined the following: the overall number of 
people's deputies of Ukraine elected by the time of holding the 
session is 338. The number of people's deputies of Ukraine 
whose plenary powers have been recognized by the Supreme Council 
of Ukraine is 336. The number of the people's deputies of 
Ukraine who received the secret ballot papers is 326. The 
number of the people's deputies of Ukraine who took part in the 
ballot is 322. 
  The results of the ballot are as follows: 
  Vasyl Vasyloyvych Durdynets: 103 votes in favor of the 
candidate and 219 votes against. 
  Oleksandr Mykolayovych Karpov: 14 votes in favor of the 
candidate and 308 votes against. 
  Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz: 171 votes in favor of the 
candidate and 151 votes against. 
  Yuriy Kazymyrovych Tyma: nine votes in favor of the 
candidate 
and 313 votes against. 
  The number of ballot papers recognized as invalid: none. 
  In compliance with Article 97 of the Constitution of 
Ukraine, 
[word indistinct] 22/6 of the temporary time-table of the 
sittings of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, the Counting 
Commission has decided to consider Oleksandr Oleksandrovych 
Moroz elected chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. 
  Chairman of the counting commission: Syrota. 
  Deputy chairman of the counting commission: Pavlovskyy. 
  Secretary of the counting commission: Stretovych. 
  The protocol was not signed by one member of the Counting 
Commission, Ratushnyy -- I do not remember his initials. He 
expressed his personal opinion which I will read out, if you do 
not mind. This is the personal opinion of member of the Counting 
Commission, deputy Mykhaylo Ratushnyy. Due to the fact that I 
was forwarding a proposal that the chairman of the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine should be elected by two thirds of votes and 
this proposal was turned down, I refuse to sign the protocol. 
This does not mean that I consider that the Counting Commission 
made any violations during the counting of votes. 
  Such is the protocol. 
  [Symoneko] Esteemed people's deputies. We must approve the 
protocol of the counting commission for the election of the 
Supreme Council chairman. I am putting it to the vote: Those 
who are in favor of approving the protocol of the counting 
commission for the election of the Supreme Council chairman, 
please vote. 
  The decision is made. 
  Esteemed people's deputies. We must pass a resolution on the 
election of the Supreme Council chairman. If you let me, I will 
offer it to you. Any objections? 
  Resolution by the Supreme Council of Ukraine on the chairman 
of the Supreme Council of Ukraine -- the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine resolves to elect people's deputy of Ukraine Oleksandr 
Oleksandrovych Moroz chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. 
  I am putting this to the vote. Who is in favor of adopting 
this resolution? 
  The decision is made.

<F P=106> [Speech by Oleksandr Moroz, newly elected chairman of the </F>
Supreme Council, in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed people's deputies. Dear compatriots. 
Guests present in this hall. 
  Frankly speaking, I was not preparing any throne speech for 
today. What I want is just to share my thoughts and 
contemplations following this thing that has just occurred, 
after you have entrusted me to lead the top power body in 
Ukraine, the top legislative body. 
  The feelings that I now am filled with, if formulated in one 
word, can be expressed by the word responsibility -- a burden of 
huge responsibility for what I am supposed to do in order to 
make the work of the Supreme Council productive and to the 
benefit the working people, the overwhelming majority of the 
population of Ukraine. At the same time I understand that this 
is your responsibility as well, because having cast your votes 
in my favor you put your trust not only in me, but you also put 
your trust in the fact that your hopes would come true, as far 
as the organization of work is concerned, as far as defending 
those principles which let you receive the people's deputy 
mandates are concerned. 
  Nevertheless, I hope that we shall manage to demonstrate in 
the Supreme Council building a possibility of society's 
consolidation and accord for the sake of overcoming that 
extremely difficult situation our state finds itself in today. 
Being aware of the fact that different methods and different 
arguments are used during the debate and having taken part in 
these debates for four years now, I understand that not all the 
arguments could be agreed to. And I saw where they were 
substantiated and where they were not quite substantiated. 
  For example, I have long shown sincere respect for my 
colleague Mykhaylo Kosiv. I know that he referred to Taras 
Hryhorovych [Shevchenko -- 19th century Ukrainian poet] because, 
as a matter of fact, he had nothing else to refer to, because I 
know that he loves Shevchenko, but there is no monopoly for this 
love. I believe that everyone has the right to this love. I 
also love Shevchenko, the same way as he does, and I know that 
nonetheless, I quoted literally what Taras Hryhorovych was 
saying. If anyone has doubts, open Holodnyy Yar [Cold Ravine] 
in the Kobzar. If necessary, I can further quote what is 
written there but it is not this that matters. 
  Nevertheless, I want us to step over something which can 
disunite us. Because we are different, this is true. We are 
different people of different convictions. The only thing which 
unites us is Ukraine. 
  Before the voting and earlier, and afterwards as well, 
people 
were coming up to me and asking: What kind of state will it be? 
What shall we build? I referred those who never read, for 
example, some political declarations by different political 
forces, including the one which supported me during the election 
The first thesis of principle written there is Ukraine's 
independence and the building of the Ukrainian state. I 
understand that the building of the Ukrainian state should not 
apply pressure on the needs and interests of either a separate 
individual or a working collective. People should feel free in 
a free state. This should be backed up by both a strong legal 
basis and an economic basis; both social and cultural issues 
should be solved. All this can be done if we show in real terms 
that we can work together, that there is unity in our lofty 
collective. And I hope that we shall come to agreement despite 
the contradictions which do exist, which is only natural. 
Because such is society and this is natural for any society. 
  I believe that without wasting much time on the formation 
of the Supreme Council structures, we must immediately get down 
to the formation of the government. And I would like to share 
my thoughts with you in this connection. 
  We should not wait for the re-election of the president or 
even the entire procedure. People are waiting for specific 
actions today. And I am convinced that if we fail to find a 
candidate for premier who would be supported by the Supreme 
Council, I am convinced that the Supreme Council will support 
one in several months time, when the election takes place, if it 
does. Because, true, the executive structure should be formed 
today to be at the top of the entire executive branch, because 
there is no other way out today. 
  Besides, we should coordinate certain norms of the already 
existing law and work out new ones so that we could link all the 
executive power in the state, so that both at the village 
council and at the Supreme Council we could feel that a single 
mechanism is working and that it is working for the lofty goal 
of building a (?united) state capable of defending itself and 
its interests in the world community. 
  And undoubtedly when I am speaking about consolidation of 
the 
Supreme Council deputies I understand that there should be 
consolidation of the top power structures in the state as well. 
There can be different approaches, but different approaches have 
value when they are truly reasonable and when they lead to 
consolidating society and achieving those interests which will 
today satisfy the needs of a specific individual -- a citizen of 
Ukraine -- in real terms. And in connection with this, it seems 
to me that there is a possibility today to bring together the 
people in the authority structures -- in the president's team, 
in the government which we shall form, and in the Supreme 
Council -- and, despite everything, to work in one direction, so 
that there would be no contradictions which do not benefit 
society and the state whatsoever. 
  I believe that even yesterday's speeches by the contenders 
and their discussion testify to the fact that our Supreme 
Council has sufficient potential. We shall increase it later 
on, when those deputies which the Supreme Council is evidently 
lacking -- and we feel this -- are elected at by-elections. We 
do need a stable Supreme Council which would conduct its course 
regardless of the upheavals which may occur in society. And I 
believe that we can work out programs toward that end which 
would ensure Ukraine's breakthrough in the implementation of 
those priorities which we feel we have today. Yesterday and 
today they were correct to mention these priorities as far as 
the economy is concerned -- the development of the 
agroindustrial complex and the solution to the power engineering 
problems. 
  But above all -- I again refer to this issue -- probably the 
very sense of the work by the Supreme Council chairman is, as I 
see it, first and foremost, accord, consolidation, patience, 
tolerance, and the belief that we shall build a better life. 
But we shall build it only if all of us together, everywhere 
and everyone, no matter where our country's citizen works -- 
either as an industrial or agricultural worker, a farmer, or a 
deputy to the Supreme Council -- it is necessary for us to work 
for one goal. And then, I think, all that we have been dreaming 
about during the election campaign and, probably, in the last 
days, will come true. I wish this to happen and believe me, 
every constructive opinion, every reasonable opinion which 
sounds in this hall will go through my conscience, through my 
heart, and I am convinced that this will promote consolidation 
and the constructive nature of our work, of our responsible 
activity. 
  I am very much grateful to all of you. And, no matter what 
is the course of events, later on I will always remember that 
these people in this hall entrusted me with huge responsibility 
and pinned their hopes on me, the hopes of the Ukrainian people. 
Thank you.

completed the registration of presidential candidates. 
Registration certificates were issued to five more contenders: 
Valeriy Babych, Leonid Kuchma, Volodymyr Lanovyy, Oleksandr 
Moroz, and Petro Talanchuk. The commission noted that the

the electoral law and thus may begin to campaign. 
  The Central Electoral Commission rejected the applications 
of 
two contenders who failed to raise the required number of 
signatures, Ivan Valenya and Mykola Rud. The Central Electoral 
Commission registered Ivan Plyushch and Leonid Kravchuk earlier.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and Mikhail </F>
Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev, 18 May -- "Nothing but rubbish -- that's how 
one has to describe reports in some of the media that I would 
dissolve the present parliament if I became president," said 
former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, candidate for the post of 
Ukrainian president, in an ITAR-TASS interview today. "This is 
nothing more than a pre-election political game," he stressed. 
  But the essence of this "game" is as follows. Parliament did 
not recognize the powers of people's deputy of Vladimir Grinev, 
co-chairman of the interregional reforms bloc. Straightaway 
some of the media reported that the former deputy chairman of 
the Supreme Soviet, entering into an alliance with Leonid 
Kuchma, had allegedly stated: "If Leonid Kuchma is elected 
president, he will dissolve this parliament." 
  "The Supreme Soviet doesn't have to be dissolved, but 
re-elected. Otherwise we will not be able to adopt a new 
constitution and solve many other vitally important problems," 
the presidential candidate stressed.

  [Text] Donetsk oblast [no date as received] -- A regular 
meeting of directors of Ukraine's metallurgical, coking 
by-product, and coal enterprises took place in Yenakiyevo 
yesterday, attended by Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk, 
Finance Minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko, National Bank Chairman 
Viktor Yushchenko, and Mykola Surhay, chairman of the state 
committee for the coal industry. Participants in the meeting 
discussed the main problems which caused the basic sectors to 
end up on the verge of stoppage or bankruptcy. Speakers opined 
that crediting enterprises without indexing circulating assets 
has not achieved anything and removed social tension only in the 
period of the election campaign. 
  The directors of enterprises appealed to the government and 
president to place the payments made on the basis of 
special-purpose credits, issued in February, March, and April, 
beyond the bounds of 1994, and to adopt a decision to turn them 
into interest-free payments. Their argument was the "entirely 
interlinked nonpayments between enterprises", the nonpayment of 
wages for February, March, and April at mining enterprises, and 
so on. "It is precisely nonpayments which oblige one to take 
credits, but as a result of inflation the interest to be paid 
becomes several times higher than the total credit, which we 
were obliged to take because of the nonpayments," said Valentyn 
Illyushenko, general director of "Donetskvuhillya". 
  Participants in the meeting sharply disputed information 
from 
Mykola Surhay, chairman of Ukraine's State Committee for the 
Coal Industry, that the plan for deliveries of coal to the 
metallurgists has been almost fulfilled (by 93 percent), and 
that "Ukraine would have enough of its own coal, and that it 
would be shameful to buy it from Poland." Participants observed 
that the plan of deliveries has been considerably understated, 
and that there will only be sufficient coal extracted in the 
Donbass for energy but not for coke and metallurgical production. 
  National Bank Chairman Viktor Yushchenko, replying to the 
demands of enterprise directors to liberalize the currency 
market as soon as possible, maintained that the National Bank's 
point of view is the same as theirs. 
  In his speech, which lasted almost one and a half hours, 
Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk maintained that he has a 
program of economic reforms "in all aspects", and that "the time 
has come when one can begin a new radical stage in the economy." 
In the president's opinion, two lines of approach are 
noticeable. The first is the regulation of mutual settlements. 
According to him, restraining the fixed exchange rate is 
explained by misgivings about a possible social explosion as a 
result of price increases. 
  Maintaining that he has an appropriate decree, which 
envisions a floating currency exchange rate and the free sale of 
currency by enterprises (which was also proposed in the draft 
decree proposed by the organizers of the meeting), Leonid 
Kravchuk expressed himself in favor of "currency regulation by 
the practice of: increasing the exchange rate of the dollar by 
1,000 karbovantsi every five days." "If we do not have any sharp 
changes in pricing, a final decision will be made without fail," 
the president said. 
  Leonid Kravchuk said the next step is to decrease the 
quantity of goods subject to licenses and quotas. 
  Speaking about regional policy, the president expressed 
himself in favor of the broadest regional independence. 
According to him, however, in order to implement the decree on 
the legal and economic experiment on four oblasts it is 
necessary for the Supreme Council to make approximately 20 
amendments to the legislation. Speaking about the Donbass, 
Leonid Kravchuk expressed his conviction that "it will survive 
in market conditions only in Ukraine, because coal is a lot 
cheaper in Russia and the stores are swamped with it." 
  Leonid Kravchuk dwelled in detail on his stand regarding the 
needlessness of holding presidential elections on 26 June. His 
arguments were supported by all the participants in the meeting. 
A consequence of the discussion was the appeal to Ukraine's 
Supreme Council on behalf of the employees of the metallurgical, 
coal, and coke by-product industries on the need to postpone 
these elections. The decision was not adopted by voting, but no 
one expressed any objections. 
  The proposals and draft decree on overcoming the economy 
crisis, which were proposed to the president and government 
representatives at the meeting (UNIAN reported them in its first 
bulletin on 16 May) did not on the whole evoke any objections. 
Ukraine's highly placed officials assured the participants that 
these documents will be analysed in order to hold another 
meeting in the near future (around 23 May) to adopt them.

<F P=106> [Ihor Nykorovych report: "A Deputy Minister Heads the </F>
Inspection"] 
  [Text] Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy was 
expected to arrive in Ivano-Frankivsk. However, perhaps, in 
connection with the beginning of work of the new parliament, his 
visit had been postponed, and the team of Ukraine's Ministry of 
Defense was headed by Deputy Minister Colonel General Ivan 
Bizhan. 
  On 10 May, two aircraft with the commission on board touched 
down at the military airfield in Ivano-Frankivsk. It was met by 
Major General Anatoliy Kalashnykov, commander of the formation; 
Colonel Mykola Moroz, military commissioner of the oblast; 
Zinoviy Shkutyak, first deputy chairman of the Oblast State 
Administration; and Yaroslav Taylikh, chairman of the 
Ivano-Frankivsk City Council and of the Executive Committee. 
  "It is an ordinary working trip," pointed out I. Bizhan 
answering the journalists' question about the purpose of the 
visit. 
  True, the representatives of the Defense Ministry arrived 
here to inspect the troops and check the work of the Oblast 
Military Commissariat, following which some of its recruitment 
resources may be mobilized. However, after all, such measures 
are implemented once every six to 10 years. Besides, it is not 
so often that top officials of Ukraine's Defense Ministry visit 
our oblast. 
  An improvised news conference was held at the airfield, and 
the deputy defense minister answered the journalists' questions. 
In particular, touching upon the situation in the Crimea, I. 
Bizhan pointed out that the Crimea is a constituent part of 
Ukraine. However, the negotiations on the division of the Black 
Sea Fleet in which I. Bizhan has been taking part for two years 
proceed with great difficulty. 
  The colonel general openly stated that he would like to talk 
about professional military matters, rather than politics. 
However, how can these two be separated? For example, 
questions arise on why the Ukrainian Army does not stand up to a 
comparison with the Russian Army. It is a matter of material 
provision for the armed forces, remuneration of the work of its 
officers, and everything that has to do with raising the 
prestige of the military service in society. 
  "You should not forget that the Ukrainian Army is being 
created in a blank space," pointed out the general. "Whereas 
the Russian Army used the structure of the former Soviet Army. 
In Russia, there have remained both the General Staff and the 
military academies. Of course, we would like our officers to 
get higher salaries. However, we understand that the state 
allocates as much funds for the armed forces as it presently 
can." 
  I. Bizhan told the audience that a new program "Serving the 
People of Ukraine" will soon be started by the Ukrainian 
Television at the initiative of the defense minister in order to 
popularize the military service and to acquaint the public with 
army problems and daily life.

<F P=106> [Interview with Petro Symonenko, people's deputy and first </F>
secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party Central Committee, by 
Yakiv Halchenko; place and date not given: "Communists Are Not 
Going To Stop the Fly-Wheel, Yet..."] 
  [Text] [Halchenko] You are probably pleased with results of 
the Ukrainian legislative elections? 
  [Symonenko] Basically yes, because we received 86 
legislative 
seats. However, there are other statistics. More than 10 
million voters supported the bloc of leftist forces -- 
communists, socialists, and peasants -- which is, you should 
admit, a large figure. Still, we are not euphoric. 
  At the same time, I would like to refute claims that 
Communists brought pensioners into parliament. The average age 
of the Communist deputies is 45. Only one is 60 years old. For 
the most part, however, these are mature, able-bodied, dynamic, 
and educated people, with vast life experience, who are ready to 
tackle important state issues. All of them know what the 
communist idea of old communists was all about and what they 
should come up with today. 
  [Halchenko] With what intentions will you, as communist 
deputies, participate in sessions of the newly elected Ukrainian 
Supreme Council? 
  [Symonenko] We understand very well that very serious and 
hard work awaits us in the Supreme Council. One needs to do a 
lot of things which the old parliament failed to do. It stands 
to reason that everything will depend on how constructive the 
deputies' work will be. This is why we, the Communists, 
actively participated in the preparations, and have focused our 
efforts on resolving certain issues before the session formally 
begins. From the very beginning, we want to show that instead 
of idle chatter, the Supreme Council should engage in 
constructive work and search for optimal solutions for emerging 
from the crisis, with due regard for differences of the regions, 
social groups, and everything affecting each voter, each of us. 
  We also understand that people who voted for our 
representatives wanted to recover the social protection 
guarantees they had when real communists were in power. This 
makes us feel especially responsible. However, we realize very 
well that it is extremely hard to resolve all the problems that 
face us. We count on constructive work with all political 
forces and representatives of various industries in the Supreme 
Council. We will seek to find understanding of problems and a 
correct way out of the situation that has taken shape. 
  [Halchenko] Still, are you going to raise political issues 
or 
will you focus on resolving state and economic issues? 
  [Symonenko] We see adoption of a new Ukrainian constitution 
as the main political issue today. We will do our best to 
encourage citizens to actively discuss the constitution and 
advise the deputies as to what political system or, say, 
national symbols our state should have. People should be 
consulted on all important issues. This is a question of a 
long-term perspective. Today, we should be guided by the 
current Constitution, with all its changes and amendments, and 
work on a new one. 
  We believe that economic problems need to be tackled from 
the 
very first session of the Supreme Council. After all, without 
an economy, no one can even talk about Ukraine's independence 
and sovereignty. Incidentally, this is something that Ukrainian 
President L. Kravchuk has repeatedly emphasized. I am sure 
there are millions of unemployed in our country right now. 
Every effort must be made to boost production. Taxation 
policies should be urgently brought in line with the interests 
of manufacturers. The financial and credit system needs to be 
revised, especially interest rates of the banks. The state 
should reassume one of its major functions -- managing the 
country's economic activities. We are for restoration of links 
with Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and other republics of the 
former Soviet Union. Only here we can find the market. It is 
no use to look for it in the West, and one should stop fooling 
the people in this regard. The Supreme Council should make a 
decision on entering the CIS. No associate membership will ever 
save us -- we will not be treated as an equal partner. 
  If the people support privatization, laws should also be 
revised. If privatization, a change of ownership forms, does not 
encourage production, one should find out why. We, the 
Communists, are often criticized for our alleged opposition to 
privatization. But we simply cannot approve of this wild 
privatization. Many people buy out property through dummy 
fronts, lining their pockets and cashing in on the national 
wealth. Others are ready to sacrifice all of Ukraine. Instead 
of canceling privatization, we should see who has what goals, 
what legislation was approved, and why it prevents the staff of 
a privatized enterprise from becoming its real owner. 
  [Halchenko] What is your attitude toward market reforms? 
  [Symonenko] There are neither market relations nor the 
market 
itself in our country. It is a different thing, however, that 
some want to pull out their "idee fixe" -- to enter a formation 
of a new social quality. Our position is: transition to the 
market is a lengthy process. Under the slogans of 
demonopolization and privatization, we want to implement the 
theoretical goal pursued by the market -- manufacturing 
competitive products. 
  There is no market in its pure definition in any country of 
the world. State policies are everywhere. They are used as 
guidelines for crafting a certain program that is financed by 
the state and regulates those processes. In our country, 
everything was farmed out to a certain circle of wheelers and 
dealers. 
  [Halchenko] Will you uphold statehood of this country or 
will 
you press for a return to the Soviet Union? Many of our 
readers, Ukrainian citizens, are worried about this. 
  [Symonenko] In our program, we have written: everything 
should be done to make Ukraine prosper and develop. We see this 
as our objective, because we realize that even though all Soviet 
peoples formally achieved some political and economic 
independence after the Soviet Union's breakup, life has become 
worse. This is why we stand for a union of equal states. We 
understand that this, too, is a lengthy process. At the initial 
stage, we will uphold the principles of economic and defense 
unions. And the process itself is the people's will. 
Communists call upon peoples of the former Union to live in 
peace, accord, friendship, and equal material conditions, so 
that they help each other and preserve familial relations, as 
they did in the past. 
  [Halchenko] What do you think about the Socialist Party? 
Will your two parties remain united in tackling key issues for 
the country? 
  [Symonenko] We have no disagreements with the Socialists. 
All efforts to drive a wedge between us are in vain. This is 
an attempt to split the entire leftist bloc. I am deeply 
convinced that it will not succeed. 
  [Halchenko] What about the "Center" group? 
  [Symonenko] I have already felt the intention of setting up 
two directions, which is a condition for setting up two centers 
-- one of L. Kuchma and other of the Supreme Council leadership. 
The Interregional Bloc for Reforms comes up with its own 
program. Not everyone supports it. We are for a situation 
where the parliament works in spite of all blocs and groups. 
  Of course, there are questions on which we cannot 
compromise. 
This is an issue of land issue. During examination of this 
issue, we will say that the land is the people's property and 
can by no means be sold or purchased. This is a fundamental 
issue. We will reject opposite approaches. While some propose 
wild capitalization today, we say: there should be national 
state property. Private property is working property. If you 
can sew or produce something, go ahead. 
  [Halchenko] In other words, you are for different forms of 
property? 
  [Symonenko] Yes. But private property should only be working 
property. The current private property is all distorted. 
Governing structures and their heads are currently being bribed 
and degraded. Hence comes the corruption, and this entire 
vertical chain of command works not for the Ukrainian people, 
but to line their own pockets. This is why not only we, but 
also all working people protest against these kinds of 
commercial activities. We say it straightforward: a parasitical 
group has appeared that is making capital. We stand against 
this kind of commercialization of our state. 
  [Halchenko] Are communist deputies going to raise a question 
of revising any economic laws -- on privatization, for example? 
  [Symonenko] You cannot do everything in one fell swoop. If 
the fly-wheel is wound up, its huge momentum cannot be stopped 
right away. This is why everything needs to be examined, and 
only then can one make a decision. The stalling of a number of 
laws can only worsen the paralysis. Our main goal is that all 
reforms must be reexamined with due consideration of the 
interests of all people, and not of the 10-15 percent who are 
pleased with those laws. 
  We will comply with the Constitution, which provides for 
setting up parliamentary commissions. We will join them and 
meet with the electorate, working teams, and consult with 
experts; and only after that, we will propose revision of 
specific legal acts. None of us will rattle the saber, as some 
try to make it out. We will clearly and resolutely carry out 
policies legally, in the interests of all people.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 18, ELTA -- Swedish Foreign Minister 
Margaretha af Ugglas arrived on a one day visit to Vilnius on 
Wednesday [18 May]. 
  After the meeting with President Algirdas Brazauskas she 
told 
a news conference that they discussed the future development of 
the whole Baltic region. 
  According to Margaretha af Ugglas, Sweden supports the 
opinion that Russian Army should leave the Baltic states by 
August 31, 1994. The minister also stressed that Sweden like 
Lithuania was interested in the demilitarization of Kaliningrad 
enclave. Sweden is ready to help Kaliningrad to develop its 
economics and to attract foreign investments. These questions 
will be discussed during the visit of Ugglas to Kaliningrad on 
Thursday. 
  The minister answered the question about Sweden's attitude 
to 
the Russian military transit through Lithuania. She said that 
this problem of the two independent states should be settled in 
agreement with the international requirements. 
  Wednesday afternoon the Swedish Foreign Minister visited 
Ignalina nuclear power station. 
  Margaretha af Ugglas also met Lithuanian Foreign Minister 
Povilas Gylys and the leader of the opposition Vytautas 
Landsbergis.

  [Excerpts] In Vilnius today Wieslaw Walendziak, the 
president of Polish Television, and Laimonas Tapinas, the 
director general of Lithuanian Radio and Television, extended 
for one year the agreement on cooperation between the two 
television networks. This agreement was signed two years ago. 
  [Correspondent Aleksandra Akinszon] [passage omitted] After 
the agreement was signed, Lithuanian journalists returned in 
their questions to the incident of a week ago, when the 
Lithuanian side refused to sign an agreement on the 
retransmission of Polonia TV in the Vilnius region. President 
Wieslaw Walendziak stressed that it had indeed been a 
regrettable incident, but it had been resolved successfully, and 
he proposed that these matters now be left alone. This is 
Aleksandra Akinszon reporting from Vilnius.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- The issue of Russia's joining 
the "G-7" economic programme may be raised after the summit 
meeting in Naples, but is not on the current agenda, according 
to presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov. 
  President Boris Yeltsin "is satisfied in principle" with the 
formula which envisages his fully-fledged participation in the 
political discussions at the G-7 summit in Naples, Kostikov told 
reporters on Thursday. 
  As far as the economic part of the discussion is concerned, 
"Russia is not raising the issue about fully-fledged 
participation in (what would be a) G-8", he stressed and added 
that there should be no haste in the issue. 
  "However, it is not ruled out that at the next after Naples 
meeting the issue of a full-scale Russian participation in the 
economic programme of the Big Seven would be raised", he said. 
  He also stressed that Boris Yeltsin is preparing for the 
Naples summit and details will be discussed during his talks 
with the French and British foreign ministers.

<F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko report: "We Are Joining the G-7"] </F>
  [Text] During his recent visit to the FRG Boris Yeltsin 
discussed with Chancellor Helmut Kohl the prospects for the new, 
democratic Russia's integration into the world economy and the 
possibilities of its cooperating with Western industrial states. 
At the same time the head of the German Government stressed that 
Bonn is particularly "in favor of involving Russia as 
extensively as possible in the political section of the G-7 
meeting" and is willing to hold appropriate talks with its 
partners on this. 
  The FRG chancellor's words along with similar statements by 
other world leaders provide unequivocal evidence that, whereas 
the West can still do without Moscow economically, it simply 
cannot resolve many international political problems without it. 
That is why the first real step toward the transformation of 
this elite club has already been taken before our country 
formally accedes to the G-7. A Russian spokesman -- Sergey 
Lavrov, Russian deputy foreign minister -- took part in the 
recent consultations in Rome between the diplomatic departments 
of Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France, 
and Japan on the preparations for the July summit-level meeting 
in Naples. Thus Moscow is for the first time a coauthor of the 
program of work for the world leaders' council and not just a 
"guest of honor." 
  Our interest in participating in the elite club is 
justified. 
The regular G-7 meetings dating back to the mid-seventies 
constitute one of the most important forums for mutual 
consultation on pressing problems of international policy and 
the world economy. And it is quite natural that the former 
"seven plus one" formula, whereby the head of our state only 
joined in the debate at the end of the session once the Western 
countries' joint course had been formulated, could not be 
effective. Russia's participation at the stage where the agenda 
is drawn up is expected to be far more productive. 
  Italy, which is to chair the coming session in Naples, has 
still not announced the range of problems scheduled for 
discussion. But it can be assumed that the question of settling 
the conflicts in Bosnia and the Near East, the role of the 
United Nations and its peacemaking forces in this process, the 
state of affairs in Africa, and the development of the political 
processes in South Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, and other 
parts of the world will top the list. Discussion is also 
expected to turn to the situation in the CIS countries, 
primarily in the hot spots of Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan, 
Georgia, and Abkhazia. 
  As for the meeting's economic program, that will still be 
discussed without Boris Yeltsin's involvement. Nevertheless the 
strategic problems involved in Russia's integration in the world 
economy which Chancellor Kohl mentioned in particular will 
obviously not be ignored. I hope that the Russian president's 
words are heeded when the prospect of affording aid for Russia's 
reforms is considered. The Russian Foreign Ministry believes, 
for instance, that the Naples meeting should discuss the 
question not so much of expanding this aid as of the West's 
meeting its prior commitments and observing the priorities 
formulated with the Russian president's participation at the 
previous meetings in Munich and Tokyo. These being support for 
reforms, the development of privatization and private business, 
an easing of the foreign debt burden, and improved terms for 
Russian goods' access to world markets. 
  Needless to say, one meeting will not be able to drastically 
improve the situation for Russia. But it will reflect the trend 
within the world community and will thus be another "brick" in 
the edifice of good-neighborliness and mutual assistance on our 
planet.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- "I think we will succeed in 
talking our Western partner into granting Russia special status 
if it joins the NATO program "Partnership for Peace", Russian 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev told ITAR-TASS after today's 
Cabinet meeting. 
  The Russian defence minister is to fly to Brussels soon to 
take part in the NATO Council session. 
  Grachev said his ministry has prepared specific proposals, 
which have been agreed with the Russian Foreign Ministry and 
will be handed over to the Russian president for approval today. 
If NATO shows interest in the position of Russia, the Russian 
defence minister is prepared to formally present its proposals 
to the members of the North Atlantic Alliance. 
  Grachev stressed however that the main objective of his trip 
to Brussels was not to discuss Partnership for Peace but to 
address the NATO military ministers and other invited defence 
ministers from European and some Commonwealth countries and 
explain Russia's defence doctrine, including the use of nuclear 
arms.

  [Text] Chairman of the Federation Council of the Russian 
parliament Vladimir Shumeyko believes that before joining the 
program Partnership for Peace, it is necessary to see whether 
Russia will lose on its interests and what it stands to gain 
from putting its signature under the document. 
  I believe there is not need to hurry up with the solution of 
the problem, he said in an interview with Interfax. 
  Shumeyko said that jokingly he calls the Partnership for 
Peace program, the "partnership for NATO" program . 
  He favored an immediate creation of CIS peace-keeping 
forces. 
He said that at present about 15,000 Russian military 
servicemen are performing peace-keeping functions in the 
republics of the former Soviet Union, while Russia alone carries 
all the financial burden for them. 
  Shumeyko said that the CSCE and the United Nations are 
unable 
to carry out in the CIS countries serious peace-keeping 
operations due to a shortage of finances.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- "Russia is in no hurry to join 
the Council of Europe, but should not be late either", Russian 
State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin said at a meeting with Miguel 
Martinez, chairman of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the 
Council of Europe, on Thursday. 
  Martinez, in his turn, said he would like to see Russia as a 
fully-fledged member of the Council and added that only a few 
countries still doubt the necessity. He drew Rybkin's attention 
in this connection to the position of Poland and the Baltic 
states. 
  Rybkin assured his guest that Russia would withdraw its 
troops from Germany and the Baltic states "on time".

<F P=106> [Marat Zubko report: "Finnish President on Karelian Issue"] </F>
  [Text] Helsinki -- "Last year Finnish exports to Russia 
increased by one-third, and imports from our country doubled!" 
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari told Russian journalists 
before setting off on his visit to Moscow. 
  During this talk, Martti Ahtisaari was asked: "Is the 
Karelian question on the agenda at this time?" In reply, the 
president said that it all depended on what was meant by the 
Karelian question. If the thrust of the question is directed at 
ties between Finnish provinces and Karelia within the framework 
of cooperation between the neighboring regions of our countries, 
then we can have a sensible discussion about this topic. 
  Is Finland assuming the role of an intermediary in the 
conflict between Russia and Estonia? If both sides propose such 
a role to us, Martti Ahtisaari stated, we will have to examine 
whether or not we have the prerequisites for this task. During 
his visit to Russia, the president intends to listen attentively 
to everything that is said to him on this subject.

ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI of Finnish President M. Ahtisaari's meeting 
with group of Russian journalists; date and place not given: 
"Martti Ahtisaari: Finland Could Become Russia's Nearest Outlet 
To Europe. The New Finnish President's First Official Visit to 
Moscow Begins Today" -- first three paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] On the eve of his visit to Moscow President Martti 
Ahtisaari met with a group of Russian journalists. During the 
conversation he gave his assessment of the current state of 
Russian-Finnish relations and shared his vision of their future, 
and answered questions, including those posed by ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI. 
  In particular, describing the current phase of 
Russian-Finnish relations, Martti Ahtisaari said that he 
considers them to be exceptionally good, and hopes that his 
forthcoming visit will promote their further development. In 
addition, Martti Ahtisaari expressed the hope that, as a result 
of his forthcoming meetings in Moscow, he will be able to deepen 
his understanding of the processes which are taking place in the 
social, economic, and political life of Russia. 
  The meeting with President Martti Ahtisaari left an 
impression of him as a calm, balanced person, that is to say the 
classic model of the Nordic person. At the same time his manner 
of speaking reveals the experienced diplomat. He undertook to 
answer all the questions posed directly, but to some of them he 
gave only pointers, leaving the interlocutor himself the right 
to draw conclusions. 
  [Question] Are there any unresolved problems between Russia 
and Finland? In particular, is the so-called "Karelian 
question" pertinent? 
  [Ahtisaari] It all depends on what we mean when posing it. 
In may view, it is above all a question of developing relations 
between Finland and the Republic of Karelia as adjacent regions 
of two countries, and we could have a lengthy conversation on 
this subject. On the whole I would describe the problems which 
exist as natural ones for partners, that is to say, they are the 
sort of problems which arise to confront the sides, to be solved 
as their cooperation develops. For example, questions connected 
with the need to open new border-crossing points require 
constant negotiations at various levels of state power. But we 
have no problems that could be called insoluble. 
  [Question] How do you see the main, priority avenues of 
economic cooperation between Russian and Finland in the light of 
the fact that Finland, all the signs suggest, is going to join 
the European Union? 
  [Ahtisaari] Last year was marked by the exceptionally 
favorable development of trade relations between our countries. 
Exports from Russia increased by one-third, and Finnish imports 
almost doubled. In addition, there was a significant broadening 
of the range of goods. The latest customs department statistics 
testify that this trend in trade development is continuing in 
the current year. 
  In my view, this means that Finnish and Russian enterprises 
have found one another. I think -- and this finds confirmation 
in the trade statistics -- that we have already reached the end 
of the initial learning curve, which is necessary for the 
transition from state jurisdiction over foreign trade to the 
establishment of foreign trade at the level of enterprises. 
Hence it is no accident that there is no shortage of business 
representatives in the delegation which is coming with me to 
Moscow. 
  As for Finland's future of as regards the EU, the question 
of EU entry will be finally settled -- positively, I hope -- 
during a referendum on this question in the fall. I believe 
that even bigger opportunities for extending and deepening 
cooperation between our countries open up as a result of our 
probable entry into that organization. If Finland becomes an EU 
member, it will be Russia's nearest outlet to the European 
market. I hope that we Finns will be able to use our "know-how," 
our experience of conducting business with Russians, for the 
further development and stimulation of cooperation in new 
conditions. 
  [Question] What can you say about the current state of 
cooperation between adjacent regions? 
  [Ahtisaari] Finland's cooperation with St. Petersburg, 
Leningrad Oblast, the Republic of Karelia, and Murmansk Oblast 
has already outgrown the framework of the interstate protocol, 
and it is frequently impossible to keep up with the speed of 
developing cooperation. This is just as it should be between 
neighbors, and here the main thing is that state organs manage 
to create the prerequisites for further cooperation at the level 
of enterprises and firms. 
  However, despite the scale of the market between adjacent 
territories, Finland's interests extend further. The Finnish 
economy contains priority sectors whose achievements can be used 
far more extensively. I have in mind the timber and 
paper-making industries, ship building, electronics, chemicals, 
and other sectors. I believe that cooperation in these sectors 
could be of interest not just to nearby regions. 
  [Question] Finland and Russia are neighboring countries; 
what happens in Russia is not a matter of indifference here. 
How will events in Russia develop, in your view? 
  [Ahtisaari] I would be pleased to answer that question after 
the end of my visit, but I will try to give you my impressions 
right now. Russia has a material base in the shape of vast 
natural resources, and this is a basis for the development of 
the economy. As for sociopolitical development, this is always a 
complex process, especially in periods of radical change. For 
example, unemployment in Finland currently stands at almost 
500,000, and this is painfully reflected in society. It is very 
important that Russia undertakes a search for paths of accord in 
order to maintain stability in society. 
  As neighbors, we follow Russia's efforts to transform its 
country with great sympathy. Therefore, within the limits of 
our existing resources, we would like to take part in this 
process. It is important that cooperation develops in all areas 
of vital activity. In this respect it is gratifying that 
lively, active relations have been established between Finnish 
parliamentarians and the deputies of Russia's revived Duma; also 
pleasing is the growing cooperation between the governments of 
our countries. I hope that all this will enable our peoples to 
respond properly to the challenge of the times.

  [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin said, opening the next round of Russo-Finnish talks 
attended by other officials, that at a meeting of Russian and 
Finnish presidents, which just ended in the Kremlin, a broad 
range of problems was discussed. 
  According to the Russian president, the head of the two 
countries discussed political, socio-economic issues and 
international problems. "It is very good that there is no pause 
in our relations: the recently elected new Finnish president 
paid one of his first visits to Russia," Yeltsin said. 
  Apart from the Russian president, the official talks are 
being attended by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, 
Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin and other officials. 
  "There are no political problems between the two countries," 
said Russian President Boris Yeltsin, answering journalists' 
questions about the results of Russo-Finnish summit talks. 
Yeltsin said that during one-on-one talks with the Finnish 
President Martti Ahtisaari as well as during talks between the 
Russian and Finnish delegations about 20 different problems were 
discussed. Yeltsin pointed out that on all international 
problems, including the Yugoslav crisis, the position of the two 
sides coincide. 
  In particular, the Russian president mentioned the 
construction of a big gas pipe line Yamburg-Germany in the north 
with an extension to Finland. According to the Russian 
president, an agreement was reached on the settlement of the 
problem of Russia's inconsiderable foreign debt. There is no 
agreement between Russia and Finland yet on double taxation and 
protection of investments, the Russian president said, adding 
that the sides agreed to prepare such agreements. 
  Yeltsin pointed out that one of the main problems discussed 
was Russia's decision to give special guarantees to foreign 
companies which will make investments into Russia at the level 
of the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry, guaranteeing them 
against political risks. 
  "This was one of the most important questions raised by 
foreign companies which was lifted today," Yeltsin said. 
  For his part, the Finnish president said that the fact that 
he arrived in Russia almost immediately after he was elected 
president shows that relations of cooperation between the two 
countries are at a good level. Bilateral economic cooperation 
has been successfully developing for a number of years, 
Ahtisaari said. The Finnish president shared Yeltsin's opinion 
that there are no political problems between the two countries. 
He expressed the hope that in future, when Finland joins the 
economic union, its cooperation with Russia will successfully 
develop as well.

  [Excerpts] Russian President Boris Yeltsin hints that 
Finland may win big economic projects with Russia. Yeltsin 
expressed his view to President Martti Ahtisaari who started his 
visit to Moscow this morning. Matti Torma reports from Moscow: 
  [Torma] [passage omitted] Both Ahtisaari and Yeltsin 
attended 
a meeting of the delegations from the two countries. After the 
meeting ended, Yeltsin and Ahtisaari gave a joint news 
conference, at which both Yeltsin and Ahtisaari announced that 
there are no political problems between the countries. 
  As for actual matters of substance, Yeltsin expressed hope 
that Finland and Russia will rapidly achieve an agreement on 
avoiding dual taxation as well as on investment protection for 
Finnish investments. As regards the economy, Yeltsin also 
hinted that new big projects may be forthcoming, but he would 
not specify what they might be. Ahtisaari also said that 
economic relations between Finland and Russia have developed 
well in the last few years. Already trade has increased to 70 
percent of the 1990 level and the economic commission's work has 
gotten off to a brisk start. According to Ahtisaari, Finland's 
possible EU membership will also further consolidate cooperation 
with Russia. 
  In the economy, there is room for improvement in the 
financing of trade -- which was indeed raised during the talks, 
Ahtisaari said. 
  In answer to a question about whether Yeltsin condemns the 
Soviet Union's seizure of Karelia during the Stalin era, Yeltsin 
replied playfully that "We don't allow that." Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev, for his part, at the end of the press conference 
put an end, at least for the time being, to the debate 
concerning Finland's possible mediation in settling the disputes 
between Russia and the Baltic countries. The mediation is not 
needed, Kozyrev said.

  [Text] Moscow, 18 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Although 
Russian-Finnish trade and economic relations have now entered a 
more active period, we still have not managed to regain the peak 
levels of former years, said Russian Federation Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin today after holding talks with President 
Martti Ahtisaari of Finland. In order to achieve this objective 
the Russian Government assigns a significant role to the 
country's regions, which are capable of establishing partnership 
ties with Finland of their own accord. During 1993, overall 
trade between the two countries grew by 40 percent compared with 
the preceding year. 
  President Ahtisaari, who is paying an official visit to 
Russia, expressed satisfaction with his talks in Moscow. Among 
other things, specific plans for economic cooperation between 
the two countries were discussed. Responding to a question from 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the Finnish president said that 
Finland's forthcoming membership of the European Community will 
not impair but, on the contrary, will expand opportunities for 
bilateral Russian-Finnish cooperation. He cited the example of 
funding for joint projects. 
  The further development of traditional trade and economic 
relations between Russia and Finland is essential to both 
countries, Viktor Chernomyrdin noted at a short briefing after 
the talks. We see no obstacles or special difficulties in the 
way of this. With whom have we always found mutual 
understanding, if not with Finland, the Russian premier asked?

  [Text] Moscow, 18 May -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev has highly praised the results of today's 
Russian-Finnish summit attended by the presidents of the two 
countries: Boris Yeltsin and Martti Ahtisaari. 
  During a conversation with journalists at the end of the 
talks, he said that Finland has given Russia great support in 
the implementation of its initiative to create a post of the 
commissioner for Baltic sea countries for human rights, 
including the rights of people belonging to ethnic minorities. 
This complicated matter will be discussed at the forthcoming 
meeting in Tallinn between representatives from the Baltic sea 
countries, which will also be attended by the Russian foreign 
minister. 
  It is the Finnish diplomacy, according to him, which played 
a 
mediatory role and helped to work out a compromise according to 
which the commissioner has been given a clear mandate to deal 
with human rights in the Baltics. "High standards reached in the 
area of human rights in Finland, Sweden, and other countries of 
the Baltic sea must be emulated," continued the minister. "We 
are not demanding privileges for the Russian speaking 
population, but we are demanding equality and will not 
compromise on this." 
  Andrey Kozyrev said that in August there will be meeting of 
representatives from the Barents sea countries and that Finland 
is involved in the preparation of the meeting. 
  Andrey Kozyrev noted that not all the questions on the 
agenda 
were easy, "But what is important is that they are not at the 
heart of a political dispute." One of the most important 
positive factors in Russian-Finnish relations is the fact that 
neither side has any territorial claims. "All these matters have 
been fully settled through bilateral agreements and through the 
CSCE," he said.

  [Text] As a result of the Wednesday Russian-Finnish talks 
in the Kremlin the Russian Central Bank and Ministry of Finance 
have been instructed to work out a system guaranteeing foreign 
investments against political risks. Such certificates will 
stimulate Finnish investments in the Russian economy, the 
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari told the press after his 
talks with President Boris Yeltsin. 
  According to Yeltsin, the talks were very fruitful for the 
simple reason that they offered many concrete venues to 
Russian-Finnish relations at a new level. Among other things 
the two sides discussed the speedy adoption of legislation for 
the protection of investments, the prevention of dual taxation 
and several others matters that should stimulate economic 
relations. 
  Yeltsin also said that several new big projects were 
discussed with the Finnish president, in particular the 
construction of the Yamburg-Germany gas pipeline in North Russia 
with a branch to Finland. Ahtisaari is going to discuss the 
matter with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin later on Wednesday, 
Yeltsin announced. 
  Yeltsin said that the Russian debt to Finland is small and 
ways of regulating it were discussed. He stressed that Russia 
and Finland have no political problems. 
  Answering a question from Interfax after the Kremlin talks 
the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev called them very 
successful, fruitful and dynamic. He said they went far beyond 
bilateral relations. 
  Kozyrev was satisfied that the Finnish side confirmed the 
need for establishing the post of a human rights commissioner 
for Baltic countries similar to the one existing in the 
framework of the CSCE. He said this is especially important in 
view of the upcoming meeting of Baltic foreign ministers in 
Tallinn. "Until recently the debate on the matter was very 
difficult, he said, and I even thought of not going to Tallinn." 
  Kozyrev said that Russian-Finnish relations, the absence of 
any territorial problems between the two sides can become a good 
example for Baltic countries, Latvia and Estonia in particular, 
so that they would not lay any territorial claims to Russia. 
  "We cannot retreat from the principles or essence of CSCE 
decisions and make territorial claims to each other. This would 
be tantamount to opening Pandora's box", the foreign minister 
said. To prevent these matters from becoming an obstacle for 
the world community they should simply never be raised again. 
  Kozyrev said he did not think Finnish mediation is necessary 
in Russian-Estonian talks. "We do not need mediators, but we 
always accept friendly help", he said. 
  "We do not demand privileges for the Russian-speaking 
community in Baltic countries. We demand equality. It is not a 
Russian question, it is a question of human rights and 
morality", Kozyrev said.

  [Text] Moscow, 18 May -- An official dinner was given in 
the Kremlin today by the Russian president in honor of Finland's 
President Marti Ahtisaari. The heads of the two states made 
speeches at the dinner. 
  The visit by the Finnish president to Russia soon after his 
election to the supreme state post confirms that our 
northwestern neighbor is making Russia a priority in its foreign 
policy, Boris Yeltsin said. We greatly appreciate this and 
highly value goodneighborly relations between our countries. 
  He said that his conversation with Martti Ahtisaari showed 
the existence of a high degree of trust and mutual respect. "I 
am confident that in the future, we shall also be able to 
conduct a productive dialogue, especially where questions of 
security and urgent issues of Russian-Finnish cooperation are 
involved" he said. 
  The Russian president paid special attention to the 
importance of trade and the economic partnership, saying that 
"as before, we attach primary importance to developing our 
relations with Finland in this sphere." "The situation seems 
most favorable for the interaction of business circles in the 
adjacent border regions of Russia and Finland," Boris Yeltsin 
said. "Modern forms of cooperation, such as production 
cooperation, compensation deals, and joint ventures have already 
been tested." 
  He noted that "an important place in regional cooperation is 
occupied by cooperation in environmental protection. The 
serious ecological situation that is developing in the Baltic 
basin and on the Kola Peninsula requires constant, coordinated 
action." 
  Our scientific, cultural, and humanitarian cooperation also 
has room for expansion. "In general, we have a lot to do, but we 
look to the future with optimism," Boris Yeltsin said, wishing 
the people of the friendly land of Suomi success and prosperity. 
  "We certainly wish to preserve everything positive that has 
been achieved over the decades in our relations and make efforts 
toward the further development of our cooperation," Marrti 
Ahtisaari said. He noted that the Russo-Finnish bilateral 
agreements had been put together in such a way that they 
corresponded to the new situation that had arisen since the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, when Russia took its place 
as Finland's eastern neighbor. Difficulties had arisen in 
economic cooperation between the two countries at that time, but 
events had taken an abrupt turn for the better last year, the 
Finnish president said. The agreements that had already been 
concluded and about which talks were still in progress would 
assist in the creation of stability in this development, he 
noted. 
  The Finnish president noted the need to make every effort to 
further develop and strengthen international cooperation and 
disarmament, which promote world security. Finland will 
continue to make its contribution toward strengthening the 
structures of cooperation in Europe and settling conflicts that 
have deteriorated to the point of armed clashes, he assured his 
listeners. 
  The head of the Finnish state voiced the hope that relations 
between Russia and the new independent Baltic states will soon 
become stable and good. 
  The Finnish president expressed his sincere gratitude to the 
Russian president for the hospitality shown him in Moscow. He 
proposed a toast to good relations between Finland and Russia 
and to the happiness of the people of Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, 19 May -- Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari 
has just left Moscow. On the last day of his official visit to 
the Russian capital he met with Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan 
Rybkin, chairmen of the two chambers of the Russian Federal 
Assembly. 
  During yesterday's talks, Martti Ahtisaari and Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin discussed about 20 questions concerning 
bilateral relations and international affairs. 
  "There are no political problems between Russia and 
Finland;" 
this is how Boris Yeltsin described the outcome of the talks. 
Both countries' points of view on international problems, 
including the Yugoslav crisis, coincide, he noted. 
  On Thursday, M. Ahtisaari had a meeting with Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. During the conversation they 
discussed bilateral commercial and economic cooperation and the

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Russian parliament lower house 
speaker Ivan Rybkin and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who 
met at the lower house on Thursday, expressed satisfaction with 
the development of relations between the two neighbouring 
countries. 
  Russian-Finnish contacts, including those at the 
parliamentary level, will develop in future too. Rybkin 
informed the high guest that Russian people wait with interest 
for a visit to Moscow by the Finnish parliament speaker. 
  The sides pointed to the importance of developing further 
economic cooperation between the two states, which, as they put 
it, should be given a boost. The president displayed interest 
in how investment legislation progresses in Russia. "The 
question of guarantees is of top priority for us," he noted. 
  Rybkin described the economic and political situation in the 
country to the president, stressing that "it was not an easy 
thing for us to adopt" the Social Accord Treaty. 
  He noted that it was fathered by the State Duma (lower 
house) 
which adopted a decision on economic and political amnesty last 
February. 
  "When the process was joined by the president who buttressed 
it with his prestige, the cause of consolidation picked up much 
more speed," he said. 
  "We in the State Duma supported the government's unpopular 
measures by adopting a very tense federal budget for this year 
in the first reading and made this move consciously," Rybkin 
said, stressing that "we should bear the burden of our reforms 
together with the government". 
  "It is important that social accord was reached and that 
cooperation between the two arms of Russian Government is 
successfully developing," Ahtisaari said. "I had the same 
impression after my talks with Boris Yeltsin and Viktor 
Chernomyrdin," the president added.

  [TYext] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Finnish President Martti 
Ahtisaari was on an official visit to Moscow on May 18-19 at the 
invitation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. During the visit 
an intensive dialogue on bilateral and other important regional 
and international problems was held. 
  The Russian president's press service reported that the two 
presidents noted with satisfaction the succession of 
good-neighborly relations and the absence of problems of 
political character in the relations between the two neighboring 
countries. The talks showed a high degree of confidence 
characteristic of Russo-Finnish relations and confirmed that the 
relations between the two countries are stable and are not 
subject to any political fluctuations. 
  During the talks and meetings problems of trade and economic 
cooperation between the two countries were discussed. The sides 
pointed out a common desire to look for mutually acceptable 
solutions of problems which appeared in this field -- the 
diversification of trade and the Russian debt to Finland. 
  The soonest solution of these problems should be promoted by 
stepping up the work of intergovernment mechanisms of bilateral 
cooperation -- the Russo-Finnish intergovernment commission for 
economic cooperation, the group for promoting the development of 
cooperation between adjoining regions and commissions for 
technical, scientific and ecological cooperation. 
  While discussing the situation in the north-European region 
the Russian and Finnish sides pointed out a high level of 
stability in this part of the continent and confirmed their 
mutual desire to strengthen stability by stepping up the 
activities of structures for regional cooperation -- the Council 
of the Baltic Sea States and the Council of the Barents and 
Euro-Arctic Region. 
  The Finnish side was thoroughly informed about the state of 
Russo-Baltic relations and prospects for their development. 
  The sides exchanged opinions on prospects for the European 
economic integration. It was pointed out that it is necessary 
to take steps to adapt a mechanism of Russo-Finnish interaction 
to new conditions in light of preparations of a Russo-EC 
agreement on partnership and cooperation and a possibility of 
Finland's membership in the European Union. 
  Separate discussions were devoted to the progress of reforms 
in Russia. The high-ranking Finnish guest was informed about 
the present stage of economic transformations in the country and 
difficulties encountered by the Russian people in the process of 
renewal. The Finnish side expressed support to the course aimed 
at democratisation and the development of the market economy and 
its readiness to render practical assistance to the solution of 
existing problems. 
  During the visit to Moscow President Ahtisaari met with 
Chairman of the Russian Government Viktor Chernomyrdin and 
chairmen of the two chambers of the Federal Assembly of the 
Russian Federation, Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan Rybkin. 
  Finnish Foreign Minister Haavisto who accompanied the 
Finnish 
president during the visit had substantial talks with his 
Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev.

Ostanin] 
  [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- U.N. military commanders in 
the former Yugoslavia have allocated several positions for 
Russian officers who will take them up this autumn, according to 
airborne troop commander Colonel-General Vladimir Podkolozin. 
  Podkolozin said on Wednesday that at first U.N. commanders 
offered Russian officers six secondary positions. "This could 
not satisfy us. We insisted on one key position -- deputy 
sector commander and received a positive answer. Russian 
officers will take up the posts this autumn," he said. 
  Podkolozin said that the 1,500-strong Russian contingent in 
the former Yugoslavia will be replaced by a new one in October. 
Under the contract, soldiers can stay in the war zone not 
longer than six months, officers -- a year. They may prolong 
their contracts for another six months if they wish so. 
  Podkolozin also said that Russia paid off its 1.5 billion 
U.S. dollar debt to the United Nations by participating in U.N. 
peace-keeping operations in the former Yugoslavia. Russian 
peace-keepers oversee cease-fire, prevent illegal arms exports 
and control troop movement. 
  Over two years of participation in the U.N. contingent in 
the 
former Yugoslavia five Russian soldiers were killed and 17 
wounded. 
  Russian soldiers in Yugoslavia receive 833 dollars a month, 
warrant officers 874-877 dollars and officers 915-1,008 dollars.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Khokhlov report: "Mission Repays a Debt"] </F>
  [Text] Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of 
Airborne Troops, held a news conference yesterday on the 
problems of Russian peacemaking [mirotvorchestvo] in the "hot 
spots" of the world and the CIS. He reported that during their 
two-year stay in the former Yugoslavia the Russian "blue berets" 
have conscientiously "worked off" almost the whole of Russia's 
debt to the United Nations: Just $200 million is outstanding 
from the previous $1.5 billion. 
  But Russia's power structures have still not drawn up a 
system of social protection for the peacemakers. In the opinion 
of the UN administration, they are the best of all the soldiers 
in Vukovar and Sarajevo today, but for some reason it is only 
the motherland that forgets that its sons are not out for a 
stroll but are at war.... 
  The Airborne Troops' commander has no information about 
sending new Russian military contingents to other countries, 
particularly Rwanda. The question of sending peacemakers to 
Nagorno-Karabakh also remains problematic: First the troops of 
the sides engaged in the conflict must be separated.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "Duma and Senate Vote Against </F>
Their Presidents -- But This Is Unlikely To Affect Situation in 
Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Washington -- At the same time as the Russian 
parliament's lower house -- the State Duma -- voted in favor of 
lifting the embargo on trade with Yugoslavia, the upper house of 
the U.S. Congress -- the Senate -- spoke out in favor of lifting 
restrictions on the sale of weapons to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Both 
in Moscow and Washington a further step has been taken toward 
the position expounded by former U.S. Secretary of State 
Eagleburger to the effect that, if people are firmly intent on 
killing one another, then everybody else has to stand aside and 
grant the belligerent parties freedom of action until their 
ardor abates. 
  The economic blockade established by decision of the United 
Nations affects Serbia and Montenegro. It does not apply to 
Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia. 
  However, all former SFRY countries find themselves under 
strict observation in the matter of weapons deliveries. Experts 
believe that this embargo is advantageous to Serbia and places 
its rivals in a known losing position. This concerns Bosnia in 
particular, insofar as Yugoslavia's entire defense industry is 
concentrated in Serbia and, to a lesser degree, in Croatia. 
  Recent reports that the Iranian Government, in conjunction 
with those of certain other Muslim states, has been secretly 
supplying weapons to the Bosnian Government -- led, as it is, by 
fellow believers -- placed American legislators in a somewhat 
awkward position. Iran is still on the blacklist of countries 
which, according to information from the U.S. State Department, 
support international terrorism. 
  However, on Capitol Hill, where the dome of the famous 
Congress Building rises over Washington, irritation over the 
half-hearted and inconsistent foreign policy of the Clinton 
administration has long been evident. 
  This concerns not only the Bosnians, whose sufferings and 
tortures have long since become not so much an indictment of 
Clinton's indecisiveness as a weapon in the hands of his 
political opponents. The views of the president and a great 
many legislators also differ over the thrust of the crisis in 
Haiti, and the means through which to avert the highly likely 
appearance of nuclear weapons in North Korean hands. 
  Alongside the number of senators and congressmen supporting 
the continuation of trade-related most-favored-nation status for 
China, despite its leaders harsh suppression of any political 
opposition, the ranks of those pushing for trade sanctions 
against China are swelling. 
  Russia, having long been almost the only spot on the 
political map to enjoy the conciliation and accord of all the 
main U.S. political forces, is also becoming a trouble spot. 
Clinton is being criticized for overly blatant pro-Russianism 
and malleability in implementing NATO's Partnership for Peace 
program in granting Russia, the critics claim, a special right 
of veto on the full-fledged entry into NATO of certain former 
Warsaw Pact members. 
  In voting by an overwhelming majority to halt the embargo on 
the delivery of arms to Bosnia, the Senate took "an easy, 
no-cost decision." Naturally, it avoids the introduction of 
American troops into the zone of hostilities, and even air 
strikes, all of which are fraught with possible losses of 
American lives. However, the prospect of the implementation of 
both resolutions -- that of the Russian Duma and the American 
Senate -- is not completely inoffensive. The appearance of 
heavy weaponry on the Bosnian side will jeopardize French, 
British, Ukrainian, and Russian lives, and will quite likely 
lead to their speedy withdrawal from Yugoslavia. 
  The history of democracy has demonstrated time and again 
that 
the implementation of foreign policy cannot be realized by 
parliamentary ballot, even if the fantasy of an irreproachable 
parliament is brought into play. So it is not difficult to 
predict that both governments, Russian and American alike, will 
try to hide behind polite smiles their irritation at the 
legislators' interference in the prerogatives of the executive. 
  During the Cold War, the lines of the division of interests 
were drawn so clearly that there was little room for opinions 
beyond the bounds of a simple "yes" and "no." Now everything is 
blurred, the majority of regional conflicts are notable for 
their striking complexity, and the involvement therein of the 
superpowers does not bode well. Which is why American 
legislators are criticizing the administration without 
counterposing their own positive programs. 
  The reasons for this modesty are clear. First, a positive 
program has to be answered for -- and certainly before the 
elections. Second, the Americans, like the Russians, are 
becoming less and less interested in foreign policy, giving 
preference to problems closer to home.

  [Text] Moscow 19 May ITAR-TASS -- French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe arrived in Moscow today on his first visit to 
Russia. Juppe's goal is to get a better idea of the fundamental 
economic transformations which are taking place in Russia, to 
give a push to the development of bilateral cooperation between 
Paris and Moscow, and to improve the effectiveness of the two 
countries' cooperation in resolving international problems. 
  "Contacts between the French and Russian leaders are 
maintained regularly. They have already become a good 
tradition, reinforced by the 1992 Russian-French agreement", the 
foreign minister told ITAR-TASS before his departure. "Russia 
is one of the world's great powers and is rich in cultural 
traditions and in her ability to renew herself, which is most of 
all thanks to, I am convinced, the Russian people". 
  Juppe's itinerary for his three-day visit is extremely 
packed, including meetings and talks with Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin, leaders in the government and parliament, Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev, and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
The top priority in the talks will belong to questions of 
economic and political mutual cooperation, including along the 
Russia-European Union and "Big Seven" lines. The two sides will 
also exchange opinions on ways to attract more French capital 
into the Russian economy. 
  Among international problems, the French diplomat intends to 
discuss with his Russian colleagues the Bosnian crisis, the 
strengthening of European security through the realization of 
the NATO "Partnership for Peace" programme, the upcoming 
international conference in Paris for the signing of the pact on 
stability in Europe, and the state of affairs in the CIS "hot 
spots" and their surrounding regions. 
  The foreign minister's unofficial activities will include 
visits to Nizhniy Novgorod and St. Petersburg, a city which he 
has wanted to visit for a long time.

  [Text] Ukraine's statement that it is ready to pass its 
strategic bombers to Russia is yet another gimmick aimed at 
creating a wrong impression of the talks on the issue, commander 
of the Russian Air Force, Colonel-General Petr Deynekin told 
Interfax on Wednesday. 
  He said that if Ukraine did not pass its strategic bombers 
to 
Russia on acceptable terms this year, they would simply turn 
into scrap metal. He also noted that even now many of these 
planes would hardly be able to take off and that all of the 
maintenance facilities were located in Russia. 
  He said he did not know anything about forthcoming talks 
with 
Ukraine on the transfer of the bombers to Russia. He also noted 
that Russia and Ukraine had not yet come to terms on the sum 
which Russia is to pay for the bombers. 
  He said that the 8 billion dollars claimed by Ukraine was 
unacceptable. Russia is ready to write off 217 billion rubles 
from the Ukrainian debt for the Russian energy and fuel in 
exchange for the bombers, he stated. 
  Ukraine has 42 heavy strategic bombers.

"To Moscow from Kaliningrad... Over Neutral Waters. We Shall 
Have To Sustain Huge Expenses Unless Regulations Are Drafted for 
Using the Air Space Between Russia and Lithuania"] 
  [Text] Today the skies over Kalinigrad Oblast (Russian 
Federation) are legally controlled by a neighboring state -- 
Lithuania. More specifically, the Vilnyus Regional Air Traffic 
Control Center. The working of Russian aircraft here fully 
depends on the mood of foreign specialists or rather political 
ambitions. Ways of resolving this problem were discussed at a 
meeting between Petr Shirshov, chairman of the Russian Federal 
Assembly's Security and Defense Committee, and Yuriy Matochkin, 
chief of the Kaliningrad Oblast administration. 
  "Two years ago," Lt.-Gen. Vasiliy Proskurin, commander of 
the 
Baltic Fleet's Air Force said, "an interim agreement was 
prepared between Russia and Lithuania on using the air space in 
the region. It established procedures for aircraft passage from 
the oblast's territory to Russia. But for reasons I am not 
aware of it was not signed...." 
  The effects were immediately felt by Navy, Air Defense and 
Border Guard pilots. An air "barrier" prevented their crossing 
Lithuania's territory. It came to the point that one day the 
Vilnyus Regional Air Traffic Control Center denied entry to the 
Russian defense minister's plane. Now military aircraft, taking 
off in Kaliningrad, fly over the sea to Liepaya and Riga and 
then on to Moscow. 
  "We shall have to fly," Proskurin said, "over neutral waters 
via the Gulf of Finland to St. Petersburg. This is quite a 
detour and it will be expensive but there is no other answer so 
far...."

  [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed concern over 
reports about the arrest by Uzbek police of activists of the 
Uzbek Popular Movement Birlik who were to attend an 
international human rights conference in Alma-Ata [Almaty]. It 
was organized by the Russian-American Human Rights Bureau. This 
was stated at a briefing in Moscow on Tuesday by official 
representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Grigoriy Karasin. 
  He noted the fact that one of the detained Uzbek activists 
was arrested on Kazakh territory. At the same time in Tashkent 
Uzbek interior bodies arrested one of the leaders of the human 
rights society and the chairman of the Association of Free Women 
also invited to the conference. 
  "There is an impression that measures were taken to prevent 
Uzbek human rights activists from attending the conference. 
Russia proceeds from the fact that activities of human rights 
organizations are a necessary condition for the functioning of 
any democratic society. Russia will strictly adhere to this 
principle in relations with all states, including the CIS," 
Karasin said. In his opinion, if information about the arrest 
of the human rights activists is true, it is necessary to 
clarify to what extent actions of the Uzbek authorities comply 
with the Charter and the Declaration on Human Rights of the CIS, 
as well as corresponding documents of the UN and CSCE.

  [Text] The State Duma delegation holding talks in the 
Chinese capital represented virtually the entire political 
spectrum of the Russian parliament. As we know, deputies have 
very differing views on reform in this country. They evaluate 
in different ways the possibility of applying Chinese experience 
in Russian conditions and of reaching a solution to border 
problems. Nevertheless, at meetings with the Chinese leaders, 
the deputies appeared to display a united front, confirming that 
China continues to be one of the priorities in Russian foreign 
policy. 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Ivan Rybkin, head of the 
Russian delegation, also agreed that economic changes must be 
based on concrete conditions in each state. But stability in 
society is an indispensable prerequisite for any reform. At the 
meetings both sides recalled the longstanding friendship between 
the peoples of Russia and China and the lengthy frontier which 
they share. But this is no longer enough for the effective 
development of bilateral cooperation. As Ivan Rybkin put it, 
the Chinese leaders took note of specific proposals to change 
the situation. These will be discussed in detail at the 
upcoming meeting of the Russo-Chinese commission on trade and 
economic cooperation and during the visit to China by Russian 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.

  [Excerpt] Beijing, 18 May -- A visit to China by a Russian 
parliamentary delegation led by Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the 
State Duma, ended today. The legislators from the Russian 
Federation made their last stop on the way from Beijing to 
Moscow at the Shenzhen free economic zone in the south of the 
country, which is always being called "the experimental 
laboratory of the Chinese reforms and openness policy." 
  The visit, which took place at the invitation of the 
Standing 
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, has been 
successful, Ivan Rybkin said before leaving Shenzhen by air. In 
an interview with this ITAR-TASS correspondent he noted that 
careful familiarization with the situation in China would 
certainly help Russians be more attentive to the experience of 
their great neighbor and "to adjust their approach to reforms." 
  For example, he explained, Russia is interested in the 
working of the Shenzhen legislators, who have been granted by 
the "superior body" -- the country's parliament -- the right to 
draw up and pass acts of legislation independently. Of no less 
importance is the legislation itself, thanks to which China has, 
in the reform years, attracted to the zone foreign investment to 
the tune of $14,400 million. This topic, as well as bilateral 
economic cooperation, will be discussed during the forthcoming 
visit to China by Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian 
Federation Government. 
  In the words of Ivan Rybkin, an understanding has been 
reached with the leadership of the free economic zone concerning 
a visit by a group of Russian members of parliament to Shenzhen 
through the channels of "people's diplomacy," and also on 
sending some of our industrialists, business people, and bankers 
there "to enhance their qualifications." 
  "There is no doubt about the desire of the Chinese side to 
develop mutually profitable cooperation with Russia, and the 
friendliness of the officials who received us was sincere," he 
assured journalists. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow, 18 May -- I am very satisfied with my visit 
to this splendid country, Argentinian Foreign Minister Guido Di 
Tella stated. Russia has never before enjoyed such respect, has 
never before evoked such sympathy in the world as it does today, 
he stressed in an interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  Touching on the talks held in Moscow, the minister reported 
that an exchange of visits was discussed, in particular a trip 
to Moscow by Argentinian President Carlos Menem at the end of 
October this year. It is expected that documents on investment 
guarantees will be signed during his visit, and a mechanism for 
mutual credits will also be discussed at last, Di Tella reported 
to journalists after making a speech at the Diplomtic Academy of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry. We very much want to have close 
relations with the new Russia, he stressed. 
  Yesterday the Argentinian minister met Mikhail Mityukov, 
first deputy chairman of the State Duma, and Vladimir Shumeyko, 
chairman of the Federation Council. An exchange of opinions on 
the two countries' home and foreign policy took place. 
  The same day, the secretary for foreign economic relations 
of 
the Foreign Ministry of Argentina, who is accompanying Di Tella, 
met Arkadiy Volskiy, head of the Russian Union of Industrialists 
and Entrepreneurs. During the conversation the crisis situation 
in the Russian economy and the shortage of currency resources 
were discussed. The sides agreed on setting up a a system of 
compensation in bilateral trade. The day before that the South 
American businessmen were received at the Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations. 
  The Argentinian entrepreneurs were very satisfied with the 
meetings held here since they saw Russia's enormous 
opportunities, Di Tella said today. Russia is and will remain a 
great world power, and the changes that are happening here are 
opening up huge prospects for its cooperation with all countries 
throughout the world, including Argentina, he stressed. 
  This evening the Argentinian minister is leaving Moscow for 
home.

  [Text] Moscow, 19 May (ITAR-TASS) -- A terrorist attack 
against Russian citizens took place in Algeria yesterday. As a 
result three people died and five were injured, said Grigoriy 
Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's information 
and press department, at a briefing today. He named the dead as 
Baturin, Petkevich, and Chenchikov. 
  According to him, a bus carrying 25 Russian citizens was 
travelling from the town of Jijel to the airport in the 
country's capital. Near the village of Ziam the bus was 
attacked. Eleven servicemen of the Algerian army who were 
guarding the convoy of Russian specialists died in the fight. 
G. Karasin said that the terrorists sustained heavy losses. 
  Viktor Posuvalyuk, director of the Near East and North 
Africa 
department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, had a meeting today 
with the ambassador of the Democratic and Popular Republic of 
Algeria in Moscow. He raised in no uncertain terms the question 
of stepping up security measures to the utmost for Russian 
citizens in Algeria and requested an immediate inquiry into the 
circumstances of this tragic incident. 
  G. Karasin emphasized that a whole series of additional 
arrangements have been made at the initiative of the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to increase the security of our 
specialists living and working in Algeria. Specifically, the 
total number of Russian Federation citizens in the Democratic 
and Popular Republic of Algeria has been halved to around 1,100 
people. The majority of wives and children of our specialists 
have left Algeria. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs told 
Russian ministries and departments which have their own people 
in Algeria and specialists working at economic cooperation sites 
outside the capital of Algeria, as well as Russian Federation 
citizens in the country on private contracts that security 
measures need to be observed to the utmost and that personal 
discipline and organization need to be stepped up.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council, by ITAR-TASS 
correspondents Vladimir Korochantsev and Yuriy Pichugin in 
Pretoria; date of interview not stated: "Vladimir Shumeyko: We 
Support RSA's Desire for Democracy and Are Prepared To 
Cooperate"] 
  [Text] Pretoria -- "Russia and South Africa have much in 
common in the present transitional period of their development 
and that creates very good preconditions for fruitful 
cooperation between them." That was stated by the head of the 
Russian delegation, Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council, in a talk with 
ITAR-TASS correspondents in Pretoria, where he was attending 
Nelson Mandela's inauguration ceremony. 
  "I formed this impression as a result of meetings with RSA 
President Nelson Mandela, First Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, 
and Deputy President Frederik de Klerk," he said. "During my 
talk with F. de Klerk we reached the common opinion that our 
states are sufficiently prepared for the successful continuation 
and development of all-around relations, especially as this 
cooperation does not have to be begun from nothing. 
  "For me as head of the Russian parliament's upper chamber 
and 
chairman of the CIS interparliamentary assembly, it is 
particularly important to ensure the development of 
interparliamentary ties," the head of the Russian Federation 
delegation stressed. "We are now faced with the task of 
creating within the framework of the CIS model legislation for 
the former republics of the Soviet Union. Its fulfillment could 
lead to the point where cooperation between Russia and the RSA 
grows into the same kind of cooperation that exists with the 
other CIS states. 
  "Excellent prospects are opened up for collaboration in the 
political field in connection with the fact that warm, friendly 
relations have formed between Russian Federation President Boris 
Yeltsin, RSA President N. Mandela, and Deputy President F. de 
Klerk within the framework of a process which today is called 
the humanization of politics. We all remember that in the past 
Frederik de Klerk, as president of the RSA, at a hard time for 
our country in October last year, supported Russia in a speech 
he delivered. Such things are not forgotten and they lay the 
foundation for the further development of our relations. 
Russia's firm support for the present democratic reforms in 
South Africa is expressed in President Yeltsin's message which I 
presented to RSA President Mandela and in his verbal message to 
F. de Klerk. 
  "In my talk with F. de Klerk I voiced the thought that the 
international public does not have the right to leave South 
Africa without attention after the victory of the democratic 
elections. It is not ruled out that after the voting and the 
inauguration everyone will calm down and the RSA will be 
abandoned to the tyranny of fate. Nothing like that should 
happen. So I allow the possibility of appealing to the 
international community to continue to support South Africa and 
to display attention toward it and its development. 
  "In that sense our bilateral economic ties are important 
and all necessary conditions exist for their development and 
expansion. The RSA has its problems connected with the 
emergence of its commodities and technologies onto the world 
market after the application of all-embracing and primarily 
economic sanctions against it for decades. That country was 
obliged to develop its own modern technologies. Now with the 
lifting of the boycott South Africa is faced with the task of 
ensuring an outlet for these technologies onto the world market. 
  "Russia is in need of such cooperation and our market is in 
a 
certain sense boundless with regard to this cooperation just as 
the South African market is boundless for many Russian goods, 
particularly conversion goods. Simple and cheaper consumer 
goods could be suitable on the local market. We can also 
discuss military cooperation separately. We discussed all this 
at meeting with President Mandela and F. de Klerk. 
  "During my stay in Pretoria I was convinced that the present 
leadership has favorable opportunities for close collaboration. 
At least I formed the opinion that the president and his two 
deputies have a great personal liking for each other. And that 
is already half the battle, or even more than half. If 
politicians treat each other in a normal, human way that helps 
resolve many complex tasks. 
  "Many good words can be said about the RSA. Its sincere 
desire to ensure successful democratic development gives rise to 
the warmest feelings," V.F. Shumeyko stressed. "With its 
expanses and wide open spaces and boundless fields that country 
reminded me of my Russian home."

  [Text] New Delhi May 18 TASS -- Russian First Deputy 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin held meetings with Indian 
Vice-President Kocheril Raman Narayanan and State Foreign 
Minister Raghunandan Lal Bhatia in Delhi today. They discussed 
questions concerning Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's 
forthcoming official visit to Moscow, which is scheduled to take 
place in June, 1994, the development of Russian-Indian political 
and economic ties as well as a number of international issues. 
  Both sides expressed satisfaction with the develoment of 
political contacts between Russia and India. They stressed that 
it is necessary to strengthen ties between the two countries, 
especially in the economic sphere. During the talks the Russian 
and Indian sides focused their attention at the forthcoming vist 
of head of the Indian Government P.V. Narasimha Rao to Russia 
and the completion of work at documents which will be signed 
during his stay in Moscow. 
  Speaking to Russian and foreign journalists, Adamishin 
emphasised that India acquired great significance to the first 
visit to the Russian capital by the Indian prime minister, and 
hoped that the visit will give a new impetus to bilateral 
cooperation in diverse spheres. Especially the two sides should 
strenghthen cooperation in the sphere of trade and economy in 
which great possibilities exist for new forms of cooperation, 
the Russian minister said. 
  Replying to a question by ITAR-TASS, the first deputy head 
of 
the Russian foreign department said that during the 
consultations they discussed the situation in Tajikistan. 
  "I was convinced that India strives more than in the past to 
help find a political solution to the situation on the border of 
Tajikistan. Russia supports an inter-Tajik dialogue, putting an 
end to attacks on the borders of Tajikistan, and India also 
adheres to an identical position," Adamishin said.

  [Text] The release of two Soviet prisoners of war, Aleksey 
Olenin and Yuriy Stepanov, who had been handed over to First 
Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin in Islamabad 
recently, resulted from close cooperation between the Russian 
Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) and the Pakistani Defense 
Ministry's Defense Agency. Tatyana Samolis, a spokeswoman for 
the FIS, who said so in an Interfax interview added that her 
statement had been cleared with the Pakistani intelligence. 
  She said that Stepanov and Olenin would arrive in Moscow at 
the end of the week. She explained that they were not forced to 
stay in Russia. They alone will choose the country where they 
will live. Her agency sought only their release. 
  Samolis said that former Soviet POWs were still held in 
Pakistan. She hoped that cooperation between the Russian and 
Pakistani intelligence services would continue.

  [Excerpts] Russian President Boris Yeltsin hints that 
Finland may win big economic projects with Russia. Yeltsin 
expressed his view to President Martti Ahtisaari who started his 
visit to Moscow this morning. Matti Torma reports from Moscow: 
  [Torma] [passage omitted] Both Ahtisaari and Yeltsin 
attended 
a meeting of the delegations from the two countries. After the 
meeting ended, Yeltsin and Ahtisaari gave a joint news 
conference, at which both Yeltsin and Ahtisaari announced that 
there are no political problems between the countries. 
  As for actual matters of substance, Yeltsin expressed hope 
that Finland and Russia will rapidly achieve an agreement on 
avoiding dual taxation as well as on investment protection for 
Finnish investments. As regards the economy, Yeltsin also 
hinted that new big projects may be forthcoming, but he would 
not specify what they might be. Ahtisaari also said that 
economic relations between Finland and Russia have developed 
well in the last few years. Already trade has increased to 70 
percent of the 1990 level and the economic commission's work has 
gotten off to a brisk start. According to Ahtisaari, Finland's 
possible EU membership will also further consolidate cooperation 
with Russia. 
  In the economy, there is room for improvement in the 
financing of trade -- which was indeed raised during the talks, 
Ahtisaari said. 
  In answer to a question about whether Yeltsin condemns the 
Soviet Union's seizure of Karelia during the Stalin era, Yeltsin 
replied playfully that "We don't allow that." Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev, for his part, at the end of the press conference 
put an end, at least for the time being, to the debate 
concerning Finland's possible mediation in settling the disputes 
between Russia and the Baltic countries. The mediation is not 
needed, Kozyrev said.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 0835 on 17 May broadcasts a 40-minute program on the merging 
of the Russian and Belarussian monetary systems. The program is 
in two parts and consists of, first, a 25-minute live interview 
with Stanislaw Shushkevich, former chairman of the Belarusian 
Supreme Soviet, by Leonid Sviridov, Radio Rossii's correspondent 
in Minsk, followed by, after a break for the news, a 15-minute 
question and answer session with listeners. 
  The live interview begins with Sviridov expressing surprise 
at Shushkevich's assertion, before going on air, that although 
the treaty on the unification of the Belarusian and Russian 
monetary systems has been signed, the official text of the 
treaty does not show the date when it was actually signed. 
Commenting on this, Shushkevich says: 
  "You are absolutely right to point this out. The Supreme 
Soviet of the Republic of Belarus finds itself in a laughable 
situation. The point is that a different document was signed -- 
it was signed on 6 September last year and ratified by the 
Supreme Soviet. Now the Supreme Soviet is, so to speak, playing 
a joke -- or else it has had a joke played on itself. This is 
because the Supreme Soviet ratified an agreement which should 
have come into force on 1 January. Then our esteemed premier 
[Vyacheslaw Kebich] announced that its implementation was being 
postponed to 1 April. Well, this did not happen, of course, and 
now nobody knows when it will come into force, because this is 
an authentic copy of the treaty, and there is no date here. So, 
nobody knows when it was signed. 
  "Furthermore, as you see, the signature of the chairman of 
the National Bank [Stanislaw Bagdankevich] does not appear here. 
In other words, he has objections." 
  Sviridov then interjects to explain that Bagdankevich's 
objections were based on Article five in the Belarusian 
Constitution. 
  Shushkevich continues: 
  "Well, if the chairman of the National Bank felt that he 
could not sign it, his reasons are understandable. He did not 
dare to contravene the Constitution. What is more, I think that 
perhaps he objected to the agreement as a whole because he 
regarded it as unbeneficial. 
  "But I would like to delve into the background of this 
treaty. Everything began with the establishment of the CIS. 
After all, the aim of setting up the CIS was to halt the 
disintegration. If anybody were to take the text of the Viskuli 
Agreement [setting up the CIS], they would see that it calls for 
a single currency and a customs and payments union. In other 
words, what was intended was an extremely integrated economic 
union, more integrated even than the European Community. We 
decided to build a law-based Commonwealth and to develop proper 
economic relations. 
  "But what transpired? Very often, these days, we hear 
complaints that the agreement is not working. A very simple 
truth has emerged. In conditions of the market economy 
governments cannot impose from above those ties which they might 
prefer. Market economies are effective because they establish 
logical and necessary ties. So, far fewer ties have been 
established by all the agreements signed on the CIS than those 
initiated from below. But this process has gotten going. There 
is no problem here. Such ties as military ones, ties in the 
field of transportation and communications, for instance, can be 
established from above, by government decisions. The movement of 
citizens and the openness of borders must be handled in this 
way. Economic ties, however, will be established by the due 
logic of things. 
  "Against this background it was announced that salvation for 
our structure -- the Republic of Belarus -- lay in the 
unification of monetary systems. I fear that Russia has very 
little idea of the state of our economy." 
  Shushkevich goes on to say: "I don't want to tax the 
listeners with complex matters. A few days ago [Prime Minister] 
Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin had an article published in the 
FINANCIAL TIMES in which he said that the output slump in Russia 
amounts to 25 percent. That is a very big figure. But Russia 
has reformed itself. Obviously, reform is always accompanied by 
slump. Russia is building on a completely different foundation. 
The Russian prime minister put it this way: This is the low 
point; things will improve from here. Clearly, he must have 
reasons for saying so, since he made this statement to such an 
authoritative publication. 
  "But what has happened in our republic? Here the slump 
amounts to 40 percent. Production fell by 40 percent in the 
first quarter of this year, compared with the first quarter of 
last year. Just listen to our radio and TV broadcasts. 
Everywhere, government servants -- I was going to call them 
satraps because of the mindless praise they go in for -- 
everywhere they forget about this catastrophic slump. Instead 
they say that everything is fine. I will not go so far as to 
quote the words of Utesov's song "Everything is fine, fair 
marchioness" but that is more or less what it amounts to. The 
collapse has actually been catastrophic. But we say that there 
is a way out of this predicament." 
  Returning to the merger of the Russian and Belarusian 
monetary systems, Shushkevich says: 
  "The Viskuli Agreement also stipulated that we would all 
use the same ruble. But what happened subsequently? Every 
newly formed country strove to gain an advantage at the expense 
of others. The banks were unable to agree on how to control 
emission. In other words, no mechanism of confidence and 
control was worked out. So, I ask, won't the same thing happen 
if we unite? Does such a mechanism exist or not? Generally 
speaking, there is nothing new in this. I do not know of any 
legal agreements which have been reached. So, the same thing is 
bound to happen again. Assuming we do not want it to happen, 
let us ask what will be the significance of the transnational 
bank to be formed when the National Bank of the Republic of 
Belarus is abolished. This signifies that Russia and Belarus 
have to have a common budget. And how can we have a common 
budget without a single taxation system, because Russian 
citizens will not pay out for Belarusians or Belarusians for 
Russians? So, there will have to be a single, fair taxation 
system. That is obvious. 
  "What does a single taxation system mean? Tt means there 
must be a single law on property. That is obvious. What does a 
single law on property mean? It means there must be a single 
procedure for privatization. But the show has never gotten on 
the road here in Belarus, if you don't mind my saying so. 
Grassroots privatization, voucher privatization, has not 
started. In Russia, by contrast, it is now ending. 
  "What does a single procedure for privatization mean? It 
means joint administration of state assets. How can it not be 
joint? What does joint administration of state assets mean? It 
means centralized release of credit and identical rates of 
interest. When I was driving to the studio today, I heard 
someone on the radio saying that Russia has reduced its bank 
rate to 200 percent. Here, however, such an interest rate would 
be impossible, it would be equivalent to a subsidy because our 
inflation rate is so high. So, this is not realistic. 
  "But if this were actually to be implemented, welfare 
benefits in the two countries would have to be the same. How 
can such a thing happen, I ask you? It can only happen in a 
unified state. Given the differences in our legislation and the 
state of our economies, this is unrealistic. So, why all this 
hypocrisy? Let me ask a blunt question: What basis is there 
for all this talk of unification, and so on, and so forth? There 
is a great deal of hypocrisy here. 
  "Basically, the issue at stake here is not unification of 
monetary systems. These are populist election slogans, and our 
premier makes no effort to hide the fact. Speaking at the 
Belarussian State University a few days ago, he said that those 
articles of the law which have come into force, relating to the 
customs union, will operate until 31 July provided he [Kebich] 
is elected. Actually, they will stay in force after that. So, 
why is he dictating terms? What kind of interpretation is this?" 
  Sviridov then refers to a warning by Kebich, reported by 
ZVYAZDA on May 14th, that Belarusia's entry to the ruble zone 
might not actually go ahead if there is an upset in the 
presidential elections. Shushkevich replies: 
  "Who then should Russia, anybody in Russia, support? After 
all, such an attitude destroys the common strategy drawn up by 
the CIS, that is, the idea of mutual settlements through a 
payments union and an interstate bank. This is the decision of 
the CIS. We have an interest in this. Why can't we -- we have 
a very big interest in resolving questions with Russia -- but 
why can't we do the same with Ukraine? It can be done through a 
transnational bank. I think Russia has an interest in this, 
too. And the CIS has made a decision on this. 
  "So, it has to be ratified by the states involved. But this 
is being put off. In other words, the agreements signed by all 
members of the CIS must be implemented. Why is this not being 
done in our republic? The answer is transparently clear. Our 
government is bankrupt and it hopes that Russia will settle our 
debts at the expense of the Russian taxpayer. 
  "But I don't think this is very good for Russians. I repeat, 
I am convinced that the Russians do not realize how bad our 
economic situation is." 
  Asked to explain his position with regard to monetary 
unification, which seems to have changed since 1991 from 
supporting it to categorical rejection of it now, Shushkevich 
says: 
  "Let me make it clear. It is true that I was angrily 
criticized by the government because I said that I have nothing 
to do with this menagerie -- I mean all these hares, aurochs, 
and other beasts -- because I believed that we should carry out 
the same anti-inflation policy as Russia. 
  However, this was not to be. It was decided that we would 
kill two birds with one stone. First of all, we were to 
introduce the cash that Russia could not give us, but at the 
same time we were to keep the exchange rate of one-to-one, and 
the two currencies were to be in parallel circulation. 
  But there are no miracles. If we restrict the outflow, the 
consequences will be exactly as I said they would be. And I am 
not the only one to say so. I am not a prophet. Half the Supreme 
Soviet were such prophets. We explained all of this from the 
rostrum. In fact, the exchange rates began diverging and now the 
exchange rate is one-to-ten. So, what happened? It was decided 
that we would print as much money as we needed. If the 
agriculture is ruined, we will give credits. We have a 
catastrophically high inflation rate, that is, price rises are 
very much greater than in Russia. But at the same time, we 
wanted to have a stable monetary system. These are the naive 
dreams of the government. 
  "So why is there such a desire now? Well, I was against 
the creation of this money. I understood what it would lead to, 
because no one can make miracles happen. It is impossible to 
make ordinary people live according to market rules, but let the 
leadership live according to distribution rules. And this is 
what they were trying to achieve here." 
  Shushkevich goes on to say: "Look at what happened this 
year. 
[Viktor] Chernomyrdin believes that there is a slump in Russia, 
but it is dictated by the reforms, and one can understand this. 
Russia bravely decided to follow the path of reforms and create 
a new class of owners. But we have no reforms. All we've got 
are individuals close to the government, and they grab more and 
more property. And look what happened in one year! I have 
already said that there is a 40-percent decline in the gross 
national product, prices have gone up 24 times while incomes 
have increased 15 times. The decline in average income is 40 
percent. And if you take into account the polarization of 
society, we have a lot of destitute people." 
  Shushkevich is then given some statistical data about the 
general dissatisfaction with the pace of reforms by the ordinary 
people in Belarus. "Well, it is just one more shattered dream. 
See what the people have been told: that they can exchange 
200,000 rubles one-for-one. So, those who have a million hares 
in the bank, well, they will be pleased, won't they?" But, he 
adds, because of various restrictions imposed by the government 
for the forthcoming exchange of the Belarusian currency for 
Russian rubles, only a very exclusive circle of people close to 
the government will benefit from it. 
  He says: "In 1991, thanks to a very honorable offer by 
Russia, we had a zero agreement, which meant that we had no more 
debts. At present, we will have $2 billion in debts by the end 
of the year. Some say that there is no real debt. But this 
year, the officially determined sum allocated for servicing the 
debt is $305.5 million. We must amalgamate these debts right 
now. But at the same time, Belarus is going to lose rental 
payments from Russian military bases. We are also going to lose 
the land tax from these bases. Another tax that we are losing is 
the transit transport tax. 
  "One would say that this is all very fine and that we will 
receive cheap oil in exchange for all of this, without any added 
value. But this is not exactly the case. And the first steps 
have already shown that excise duties are increasing, and the 
price [of Russian oil sold to Belarus] is slowly going back to 
what it was. All of this is a fairy tale, a myth, because once 
people start barter deals -- I will give you a bit of this if 
you give me a bit of that -- instead of counting everything in 
money, misunderstandings arise right away." 
  Shushkevich goes on to say that Russia should refine all the 
crude oil it exports to the West, and that it should do it 
together with Belarus, because of transportation links existing 
in Belarus. He then adds: "A question arises. Who wants this 
treaty? Who wants to transport oil to the West, quickly and 
free of charge? Is it the Russian state? We are not going to 
take this money from commercial structures. Do you understand? 
One must always look for a reason, and it seems to me that it 
is not the Russian state which is more interested in this, but 
rather the Russian Gazprom and other commercial structures. 
They are forcing us to make our taxpayers pay for this transit 
facility, ostensibly for Russia, but it is not for Russia that 
we will be doing this, but for some entirely different 
structures. 
  "Why is it that commercial structures will not be paying any 
taxes? Russian commercial structures will not be paying any 
taxes for the transit of gas through Belrusian territory! I 
don't think this is fair! And in general, I would say that 
whenever something somewhere is going for free, there is a 
culprit. And in the final account, Russia will be guilty. I do 
not think this is right, I do not think this is in Russia's 
interest." 
  During the question and answer session at the end of the 
program Shushkevich is asked why he is giving his interview to 
Radio Rossii rather than to Belarusian radio. Shushkevich 
replies: 
  "In our republic, you know, the authorities have what 
amounts 
to a monopoly over all the mass media. Our government has 
decided that no one holding views different from itself shall 
have airtime on Belarusian radio and, especially, Belarusian TV. 
There are very few exceptions." 
  The program ends with a final question about why Belarusian 
sour cream is being exported to Russia.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Mircea Snegur is reported to have praised 
a government-proposed new five-year plan spread over a period up 
to 1999. The government is given 10 days in which to amend the 
paper before it goes to parliament. In an interview with 
INTERFAX, Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli was speaking about the 
main guidelines of the country's social and economic reforms. 
  IF: What exactly are the Moldovan Government's priorities? 
  SANGHELI: Well, these include the consolidation of the 
country's statehood, its political and economic independence and 
creation of an effective advanced economy. 
  We will be seeking to the Republic's incorporation in the 
world economy, ensure decent living standards and protect more 
vulnerable sections. 
  IF: Is it possible to say that the government is firmly 
committed to a market-led economy? 
  SANGHELI: Yes. At the same time, we are working on a 
premise that market economy should not be an end in itself, but 
a means of improving production efficiency and living standards. 
The planned reforms and transition to market relations combined 
with government regulation will be carried out with an eye on 
the country's traditions and specifics, the structure and 
distribution of the workforce, cultural and social factors. 
  The government is seeking to enlarge the social basis of 
reforms by swaying support from broader sections of the 
population. I do not think the state and government must be 
perceived as forces acting against the public. That is why we 
intend to pursue a coherent and economically measured social 
policy. 
  Although international aid, investment, credits, 
technologies 
and expertise are only too welcome, Moldova must rely only on 
its own potential. 
  IF: The economic situation in Moldova remains unstable. 
Since early 1990's, its GDP and national income has fallen by 
46.5 and 44.7 percent respectively with industrial and farm 
output dropping by 30.3 and 29.8 percent. True, there are also 
positive trends, but these are not too many. How is the country 
going to reverse those negative trends? 
  SANHGELI: Nothing short of effective economic reform 
measures, stimulation of production and social security 
safeguards can help to do so. 
  Last year, the government launched a nationwide 
privatization 
program including stock taking and evaluation of the state 
property. Bonds (similar to Russia's privatization vouchers -- 
IF) were distributed among Moldovan citizens. By now, more than 
300 state enterprises have been turned into stock holding 
companies. The process of demonopolization is now under way in 
retail trade, catering and services. 
  With the first stage of land reform now completed, a total 
of 
284,000 ha of land has fallen into private hands. The second 
stage will allow rural residents to share in the land or assets 
of state farm producers. 
  IF Note: The country's privatization land fund runs at about 
two million ha or 62 percent of the country's total. By now, 60 
percent of those entitled to land ownership have received 
appropriate land titles. 
  The process is under way of transforming state or collective 
farms into stock holding companies, farm cooperatives or firms 
and private farms. The number of farmsteads runs at nearly 
10,000. 
  To promote entrepreneurial business, a support fund was set 
up to help promote private enterprise and small-size business. 
Similar government programs are to be approved soon. The 
private sector units about 34,000 economic entities, with more 
than 15,000 of them emerging last year. 
  IF: What sort of financial, taxation and crediting policy is 
the government planning to pursue in the next few years? 
  SANGHELI: We will embark on a moderately tight financial and 
crediting policies. This provides for an increase in government 
revenues by improving taxation and financial discipline and 
combatting tax evasion. We also plan to raise revenues at the 
cost of state, lease and stock holding companies as well as 
proceeds from the sale of state property, utilization of natural 
resources and land rent. 
  Plans are also in progress to issue short-term bonds and 
securities at attractive conditions in an effort to achieve a a 
deficit-free budget. 
  The government sets great store by the decentralization of 
the budgetary system which will create a real economic basis for 
local self-management. It is planned that individual, 
corporate, property and local taxes and duties will be levied to 
help form local budgets. 
  Decentralization of the budget and greater economic 
independence by the regions can help defuse tension between the 
center and local government bodies, including Transdniestria 
[Transdniester] and Gagauzia.

HAAL, pp 1-3: "News Bulletin" No. 95/94] 
  [Text] The predicted vote of no confidence to Prime 
Minister Mart Laar was canceled as the National Independence 
Party (ERSP) demanded that its ministers did not require the 
linking of the vote on state guarantees to a foreign loan to a 
vote of no confidence. 
  Laar told the news conference that he had asked the cabinet 
members about the vote, but nobody had wanted to raise the 
issue. Laar did admit that "some politicians" have a desire to 
reorganise the government, but he described it as a demolition, 
rather than rearrangement of the cabinet. "I would not dare to 
term it a press speculation, since the matter was too serious," 
Laar told the conference. He called for the dissatisfied 
"Fatherland"-appointed ministers to discuss their objections 
with the ruling coalition factions. 
  The "Fatherland" faction made a statement yesterday 
declaring 
that any attempts to force the premier to resign would cause 
great political harm to Estonia in the present situation. 
  A cabinet session will be held today, according to Social 
Minister Marju Lauristin. She declined from elaborating on the 
agenda of the session.

regard as an important means of promoting the security of 
Europe. Levits accentuated some so far unresolved or unclear 
issues, namely the right of countries involved in the stability 
pact to choose for themselves the themes for discussion at 
regional round-table talks, the need to determine that 
judicially existing borders are accepted, not generally existing 
borders, as well as to give clarity to the concept of minorities

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has issued an 
appeal to the Crimean Supreme Soviet. I have learned, the 
appeal states, that reinstatement of several provisions of the 
Crimean Constitution, in the version adopted on 6 May 1992, is 
expected to be examined at a plenary session of the Crimean 
Supreme Soviet. In particular, they concern the incorporation 
of the Crimean Republic into Ukraine based on treaties and 
agreements, the right of Crimean residents to dual citizenship, 
creation of individual military formations, etc. Resolution of 
these issues in compliance with the Ukrainian Constitution and 
Ukrainian legislation on sharing powers between government 
institutions in Ukraine and the Crimean Republic, adopted by the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet, lies exclusively with the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council. As you understand, in question here is a 
revision of fundamental principles of relations between Ukraine 
and one of its integral parts, the Crimean Republic. Violation 
of those principles may lead to conflicts and other 
unpredictable consequences. 
  By adopting such decisions, Leonid Kravchuk's appeal to the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet emphasized, you will practically be 
making moves aimed at violating Ukraine's territorial integrity, 
which runs counter to generally accepted international 
standards. The international community closely watches 
developments in the Crimea and hopes that we will be wise enough 
to keep the situation within the limits of the currently valid 
Ukrainian and Crimean Constitutions. 
  I hope that while performing important state work, you will 
display high political maturity, balanced approaches, common 
sense, wisdom, and an understanding of the tremendous 
responsibility you have assumed. I suggest that before 
examining those issues at the session, you send a 
plenipotentiary delegation of Crimean people's deputies to Kiev 
for handling issues that will be examined along with the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council, the administration of the Ukrainian 
president, and the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, the appeal 
from Leonid Kravchuk noted.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 18, BNS -- Lithuania has already 
created a democratic government structure, secured the 
principles of democracy in social life and established a legal 
system, Lithuanian Prime Minister said Wednesday [18 May]. 
  Speaking at a World Bank conference that opened in Paris, 
Slezevicius presented his country's investment program and 
economic strategy. 
  The premier said the economic reforms carried out by the 
Lithuanian Government are aimed at free-market transformations 
and integration into Europe. Slezevicius noted that Lithuania 
was one of the first former Soviet republics to become a member 
of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
  Introducing Lithuania's economic strategy, Slezevicius said 
the government seeks to achieve economic stability and to carry 
out structural reforms. He said the primary tasks are to make 
Lithuania's monetary and fiscal policies firmer, to liberalize 
export and import, to reduce government subsidies to enterprises 
and individuals. 
  The Lithuanian premier said the process of state-property 
privatization, introduction of a stable national currency and 
the value-added tax, as well as the creation of the currency 
board helped curb inflation. In Slezevicius' words, inflation 
should not exceed 35-50 percent this year and should be reduced 
to 15-20 percent next year. 
  The premier said Lithuania is now entering a new stage of 
restructuring the economy. Slezevicius said a legal framework 
stimulating the private sector and foreign investments in it is 
currently under preparation. He said primary attention in 
reorganizing enterprises is paid to investments and economic 
development. 
  Slezevicius said the Lithuanian Government intends to 
complete the first stage of privatization this year and to start 
the next one, during which the principle of giving away property 
will be no longer applied. Privatization will be carried out 
for cash, foreign investors and Lithuanian citizens will have 
equal rights in the process, the premier said. 
  Introducing Lithuania's investment program for 1995-1997, 
Slezevicius said priority will be given to energy, 
transportation and environment protection. 
  Slezevicius emphasized that Lithuania is still dependent on 
Russia's energy resources. The premier said the Lithuanian 
Government will seek to increase the reliability of primary 
energy supplies, to use energy more rationally, to upgrade the 
safety of the Ignalina nuclear power plant, to expand the use of 
internal and renewable energy resources and to reduce the 
negative effect of energy on the environment. 
  The Lithuanian premier said around 700 million USD are 
needed 
to carry out major energy projects: 40 million to complete the 
construction of the Kruonis hydro-electric power station; 20-25 
million to build nuclear fuel storage facilities in Ignalina; 
90-100 [million] to upgrade the safety of Ignalina's reactors; 
90 million to build the Butinge oil terminal; 50 million to 
build a pipeline from Butinge to Mazeikiai; 90 million to 
modernize the Klaipeda oil export terminal; 100 million to 
modernize municipal heating systems. 
  Slezevicius said one of the top priorities in transportation 
is to develop the Klaipeda seaport and a related land transport 
infrastructure. He said the port's reconstruction would cost 
around 80-90 million dollars. The costs of the initial stages 
of the Via Baltica highway project reach 40 million dollars. 
The premier said the construction of a 
Warsaw-Kaunas-Riga-Tallinn railroad line with European standard 
tracks is also listed among priority projects. 
  Discussing environment protection, Slezevicius said primary 
attention should be paid to such problems as sewage, dangerous 
waste and air pollution. 
  The Lithuanian premier said pollution of inland waters 
endangers the Baltic Sea, therefore it is necessary to complete 
the construction of water refinement systems in Vilnius, Kaunas, 
Klaipeda, Siauliai and Palanga. Slezevicius said these projects 
require some 80 million dollars. Another 100 million dollars 
are necessary to carry out a dangerous waste recycling and 
disposal project. 
  Slezevicius said the Lithuanian Government has already 
prepared and approved national development programs in the 
fields of energy and transportation. 
  In implementing priority projects, the Lithuanian Government 
will coordinate actions with its Baltic neighbors, Nordic and 
other countries, Slezevicius said. In his words, Lithuania's 
investment program will be distributed to potential investors 
through structures of the European Union in July. The premier 
said the program will be presented to major international 
financial organizations and interested countries at a 
conference, which is likely to be arranged late this year or in 
early 1995. The Lithuanian premier said bilateral meetings with 
potential investors may start in September. 
  In conclusion, Slezevicius urged international financial 
organizations and interested countries to cooperate more closely 
among themselves in dealing with investment projects in 
Lithuania. He assured the conference's participants that the 
Lithuanian Government will ensure the necessary conditions and 
support for foreign investors.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Cherkovets: "To the Front Outside the </F>
Pentagon...."] 
  [Text] INTERFAX has reported that Russian Defense Minister 
P. Grachev in a telephone conversation with his U.S. 
counterpart, W. Perry, supported the holding of the scheduled 
joint Russian-U.S. maneuvers at Orenburg Oblast's Totskoye test 
ground. 
  This idea, as we know, has given rise to sharp criticism in 
Russian society. The State Duma has urged President B. Yeltsin 
to abandon the maneuvers and the latter in turn has "suggested" 
to the Defense Ministry that it think about rescheduling them -- 
in the interests of "achieving national accord." But that 
prospect thoroughly displeased the Pentagon, whose high-ranking 
representatives issued a statement in favor of "rehearsing joint 
peacekeeping actions." 
  Meanwhile very curious details became known. The Russian 
side has rejected the return exercise suggested by the Americans 
on their territory: Why inconvenience our host, it said! But 
inconveniencing its own citizens -- that is another matter, it 
can do that. 
  As V. Semenov, commander in chief of the RUssian Ground 
Forces, said in an interview with OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, in response 
to proposals to hold joint exercises on FRG territory the 
Germans refused. Why did their country need such a "gift?" But 
Russia, through its defense minister, is giving the go-ahead to 
a dubious action and counter to assurances that they are seeking 
"accord" the authorities nonetheless intend to ignore the State 
Duma decree, the Orenburg Oblast local authorities' decision, 
and public opinion....

<F P=106> [Marat Zubko report: "Finnish President on Karelian Issue"] </F>
  [Text] Helsinki -- "Last year Finnish exports to Russia 
increased by one-third, and imports from our country doubled!" 
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari told Russian journalists 
before setting off on his visit to Moscow. 
  During this talk, Martti Ahtisaari was asked: "Is the 
Karelian question on the agenda at this time?" In reply, the 
president said that it all depended on what was meant by the 
Karelian question. If the thrust of the question is directed at 
ties between Finnish provinces and Karelia within the framework 
of cooperation between the neighboring regions of our countries, 
then we can have a sensible discussion about this topic. 
  Is Finland assuming the role of an intermediary in the 
conflict between Russia and Estonia? If both sides propose such 
a role to us, Martti Ahtisaari stated, we will have to examine 
whether or not we have the prerequisites for this task. During 
his visit to Russia, the president intends to listen attentively 
to everything that is said to him on this subject.

ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI of Finnish President M. Ahtisaari's meeting 
with group of Russian journalists; date and place not given: 
"Martti Ahtisaari: Finland Could Become Russia's Nearest Outlet 
To Europe. The New Finnish President's First Official Visit to 
Moscow Begins Today" -- first three paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] On the eve of his visit to Moscow President Martti 
Ahtisaari met with a group of Russian journalists. During the 
conversation he gave his assessment of the current state of 
Russian-Finnish relations and shared his vision of their future, 
and answered questions, including those posed by ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI. 
  In particular, describing the current phase of 
Russian-Finnish relations, Martti Ahtisaari said that he 
considers them to be exceptionally good, and hopes that his 
forthcoming visit will promote their further development. In 
addition, Martti Ahtisaari expressed the hope that, as a result 
of his forthcoming meetings in Moscow, he will be able to deepen 
his understanding of the processes which are taking place in the 
social, economic, and political life of Russia. 
  The meeting with President Martti Ahtisaari left an 
impression of him as a calm, balanced person, that is to say the 
classic model of the Nordic person. At the same time his manner 
of speaking reveals the experienced diplomat. He undertook to 
answer all the questions posed directly, but to some of them he 
gave only pointers, leaving the interlocutor himself the right 
to draw conclusions. 
  [Question] Are there any unresolved problems between Russia 
and Finland? In particular, is the so-called "Karelian 
question" pertinent? 
  [Ahtisaari] It all depends on what we mean when posing it. 
In may view, it is above all a question of developing relations 
between Finland and the Republic of Karelia as adjacent regions 
of two countries, and we could have a lengthy conversation on 
this subject. On the whole I would describe the problems which 
exist as natural ones for partners, that is to say, they are the 
sort of problems which arise to confront the sides, to be solved 
as their cooperation develops. For example, questions connected 
with the need to open new border-crossing points require 
constant negotiations at various levels of state power. But we 
have no problems that could be called insoluble. 
  [Question] How do you see the main, priority avenues of 
economic cooperation between Russian and Finland in the light of 
the fact that Finland, all the signs suggest, is going to join 
the European Union? 
  [Ahtisaari] Last year was marked by the exceptionally 
favorable development of trade relations between our countries. 
Exports from Russia increased by one-third, and Finnish imports 
almost doubled. In addition, there was a significant broadening 
of the range of goods. The latest customs department statistics 
testify that this trend in trade development is continuing in 
the current year. 
  In my view, this means that Finnish and Russian enterprises 
have found one another. I think -- and this finds confirmation 
in the trade statistics -- that we have already reached the end 
of the initial learning curve, which is necessary for the 
transition from state jurisdiction over foreign trade to the 
establishment of foreign trade at the level of enterprises. 
Hence it is no accident that there is no shortage of business 
representatives in the delegation which is coming with me to 
Moscow. 
  As for Finland's future of as regards the EU, the question 
of EU entry will be finally settled -- positively, I hope -- 
during a referendum on this question in the fall. I believe 
that even bigger opportunities for extending and deepening 
cooperation between our countries open up as a result of our 
probable entry into that organization. If Finland becomes an EU 
member, it will be Russia's nearest outlet to the European 
market. I hope that we Finns will be able to use our "know-how," 
our experience of conducting business with Russians, for the 
further development and stimulation of cooperation in new 
conditions. 
  [Question] What can you say about the current state of 
cooperation between adjacent regions? 
  [Ahtisaari] Finland's cooperation with St. Petersburg, 
Leningrad Oblast, the Republic of Karelia, and Murmansk Oblast 
has already outgrown the framework of the interstate protocol, 
and it is frequently impossible to keep up with the speed of 
developing cooperation. This is just as it should be between 
neighbors, and here the main thing is that state organs manage 
to create the prerequisites for further cooperation at the level 
of enterprises and firms. 
  However, despite the scale of the market between adjacent 
territories, Finland's interests extend further. The Finnish 
economy contains priority sectors whose achievements can be used 
far more extensively. I have in mind the timber and 
paper-making industries, ship building, electronics, chemicals, 
and other sectors. I believe that cooperation in these sectors 
could be of interest not just to nearby regions. 
  [Question] Finland and Russia are neighboring countries; 
what happens in Russia is not a matter of indifference here. 
How will events in Russia develop, in your view? 
  [Ahtisaari] I would be pleased to answer that question after 
the end of my visit, but I will try to give you my impressions 
right now. Russia has a material base in the shape of vast 
natural resources, and this is a basis for the development of 
the economy. As for sociopolitical development, this is always a 
complex process, especially in periods of radical change. For 
example, unemployment in Finland currently stands at almost 
500,000, and this is painfully reflected in society. It is very 
important that Russia undertakes a search for paths of accord in 
order to maintain stability in society. 
  As neighbors, we follow Russia's efforts to transform its 
country with great sympathy. Therefore, within the limits of 
our existing resources, we would like to take part in this 
process. It is important that cooperation develops in all areas 
of vital activity. In this respect it is gratifying that 
lively, active relations have been established between Finnish 
parliamentarians and the deputies of Russia's revived Duma; also 
pleasing is the growing cooperation between the governments of 
our countries. I hope that all this will enable our peoples to 
respond properly to the challenge of the times.

  [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin said, opening the next round of Russo-Finnish talks 
attended by other officials, that at a meeting of Russian and 
Finnish presidents, which just ended in the Kremlin, a broad 
range of problems was discussed. 
  According to the Russian president, the head of the two 
countries discussed political, socio-economic issues and 
international problems. "It is very good that there is no pause 
in our relations: the recently elected new Finnish president 
paid one of his first visits to Russia," Yeltsin said. 
  Apart from the Russian president, the official talks are 
being attended by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, 
Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin and other officials. 
  "There are no political problems between the two countries," 
said Russian President Boris Yeltsin, answering journalists' 
questions about the results of Russo-Finnish summit talks. 
Yeltsin said that during one-on-one talks with the Finnish 
President Martti Ahtisaari as well as during talks between the 
Russian and Finnish delegations about 20 different problems were 
discussed. Yeltsin pointed out that on all international 
problems, including the Yugoslav crisis, the position of the two 
sides coincide. 
  In particular, the Russian president mentioned the 
construction of a big gas pipe line Yamburg-Germany in the north 
with an extension to Finland. According to the Russian 
president, an agreement was reached on the settlement of the 
problem of Russia's inconsiderable foreign debt. There is no 
agreement between Russia and Finland yet on double taxation and 
protection of investments, the Russian president said, adding 
that the sides agreed to prepare such agreements. 
  Yeltsin pointed out that one of the main problems discussed 
was Russia's decision to give special guarantees to foreign 
companies which will make investments into Russia at the level 
of the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry, guaranteeing them 
against political risks. 
  "This was one of the most important questions raised by 
foreign companies which was lifted today," Yeltsin said. 
  For his part, the Finnish president said that the fact that 
he arrived in Russia almost immediately after he was elected 
president shows that relations of cooperation between the two 
countries are at a good level. Bilateral economic cooperation 
has been successfully developing for a number of years, 
Ahtisaari said. The Finnish president shared Yeltsin's opinion 
that there are no political problems between the two countries. 
He expressed the hope that in future, when Finland joins the 
economic union, its cooperation with Russia will successfully 
develop as well.

  [Text] Moscow, 18 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Although 
Russian-Finnish trade and economic relations have now entered a 
more active period, we still have not managed to regain the peak 
levels of former years, said Russian Federation Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin today after holding talks with President 
Martti Ahtisaari of Finland. In order to achieve this objective 
the Russian Government assigns a significant role to the 
country's regions, which are capable of establishing partnership 
ties with Finland of their own accord. During 1993, overall 
trade between the two countries grew by 40 percent compared with 
the preceding year. 
  President Ahtisaari, who is paying an official visit to 
Russia, expressed satisfaction with his talks in Moscow. Among 
other things, specific plans for economic cooperation between 
the two countries were discussed. Responding to a question from 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the Finnish president said that 
Finland's forthcoming membership of the European Community will 
not impair but, on the contrary, will expand opportunities for 
bilateral Russian-Finnish cooperation. He cited the example of 
funding for joint projects. 
  The further development of traditional trade and economic 
relations between Russia and Finland is essential to both 
countries, Viktor Chernomyrdin noted at a short briefing after 
the talks. We see no obstacles or special difficulties in the 
way of this. With whom have we always found mutual 
understanding, if not with Finland, the Russian premier asked?

  [Text] Moscow, 18 May -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev has highly praised the results of today's 
Russian-Finnish summit attended by the presidents of the two 
countries: Boris Yeltsin and Martti Ahtisaari. 
  During a conversation with journalists at the end of the 
talks, he said that Finland has given Russia great support in 
the implementation of its initiative to create a post of the 
commissioner for Baltic sea countries for human rights, 
including the rights of people belonging to ethnic minorities. 
This complicated matter will be discussed at the forthcoming 
meeting in Tallinn between representatives from the Baltic sea 
countries, which will also be attended by the Russian foreign 
minister. 
  It is the Finnish diplomacy, according to him, which played 
a 
mediatory role and helped to work out a compromise according to 
which the commissioner has been given a clear mandate to deal 
with human rights in the Baltics. "High standards reached in the 
area of human rights in Finland, Sweden, and other countries of 
the Baltic sea must be emulated," continued the minister. "We 
are not demanding privileges for the Russian speaking 
population, but we are demanding equality and will not 
compromise on this." 
  Andrey Kozyrev said that in August there will be meeting of 
representatives from the Barents sea countries and that Finland 
is involved in the preparation of the meeting. 
  Andrey Kozyrev noted that not all the questions on the 
agenda 
were easy, "But what is important is that they are not at the 
heart of a political dispute." One of the most important 
positive factors in Russian-Finnish relations is the fact that 
neither side has any territorial claims. "All these matters have 
been fully settled through bilateral agreements and through the 
CSCE," he said.

  [Text] As a result of the Wednesday Russian-Finnish talks 
in the Kremlin the Russian Central Bank and Ministry of Finance 
have been instructed to work out a system guaranteeing foreign 
investments against political risks. Such certificates will 
stimulate Finnish investments in the Russian economy, the 
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari told the press after his 
talks with President Boris Yeltsin. 
  According to Yeltsin, the talks were very fruitful for the 
simple reason that they offered many concrete venues to 
Russian-Finnish relations at a new level. Among other things 
the two sides discussed the speedy adoption of legislation for 
the protection of investments, the prevention of dual taxation 
and several others matters that should stimulate economic 
relations. 
  Yeltsin also said that several new big projects were 
discussed with the Finnish president, in particular the 
construction of the Yamburg-Germany gas pipeline in North Russia 
with a branch to Finland. Ahtisaari is going to discuss the 
matter with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin later on Wednesday, 
Yeltsin announced. 
  Yeltsin said that the Russian debt to Finland is small and 
ways of regulating it were discussed. He stressed that Russia 
and Finland have no political problems. 
  Answering a question from Interfax after the Kremlin talks 
the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev called them very 
successful, fruitful and dynamic. He said they went far beyond 
bilateral relations. 
  Kozyrev was satisfied that the Finnish side confirmed the 
need for establishing the post of a human rights commissioner 
for Baltic countries similar to the one existing in the 
framework of the CSCE. He said this is especially important in 
view of the upcoming meeting of Baltic foreign ministers in 
Tallinn. "Until recently the debate on the matter was very 
difficult, he said, and I even thought of not going to Tallinn." 
  Kozyrev said that Russian-Finnish relations, the absence of 
any territorial problems between the two sides can become a good 
example for Baltic countries, Latvia and Estonia in particular, 
so that they would not lay any territorial claims to Russia. 
  "We cannot retreat from the principles or essence of CSCE 
decisions and make territorial claims to each other. This would 
be tantamount to opening Pandora's box", the foreign minister 
said. To prevent these matters from becoming an obstacle for 
the world community they should simply never be raised again. 
  Kozyrev said he did not think Finnish mediation is necessary 
in Russian-Estonian talks. "We do not need mediators, but we 
always accept friendly help", he said. 
  "We do not demand privileges for the Russian-speaking 
community in Baltic countries. We demand equality. It is not a 
Russian question, it is a question of human rights and 
morality", Kozyrev said.

  [Text] Moscow, 18 May -- An official dinner was given in 
the Kremlin today by the Russian president in honor of Finland's 
President Marti Ahtisaari. The heads of the two states made 
speeches at the dinner. 
  The visit by the Finnish president to Russia soon after his 
election to the supreme state post confirms that our 
northwestern neighbor is making Russia a priority in its foreign 
policy, Boris Yeltsin said. We greatly appreciate this and 
highly value goodneighborly relations between our countries. 
  He said that his conversation with Martti Ahtisaari showed 
the existence of a high degree of trust and mutual respect. "I 
am confident that in the future, we shall also be able to 
conduct a productive dialogue, especially where questions of 
security and urgent issues of Russian-Finnish cooperation are 
involved" he said. 
  The Russian president paid special attention to the 
importance of trade and the economic partnership, saying that 
"as before, we attach primary importance to developing our 
relations with Finland in this sphere." "The situation seems 
most favorable for the interaction of business circles in the 
adjacent border regions of Russia and Finland," Boris Yeltsin 
said. "Modern forms of cooperation, such as production 
cooperation, compensation deals, and joint ventures have already 
been tested." 
  He noted that "an important place in regional cooperation is 
occupied by cooperation in environmental protection. The 
serious ecological situation that is developing in the Baltic 
basin and on the Kola Peninsula requires constant, coordinated 
action." 
  Our scientific, cultural, and humanitarian cooperation also 
has room for expansion. "In general, we have a lot to do, but we 
look to the future with optimism," Boris Yeltsin said, wishing 
the people of the friendly land of Suomi success and prosperity. 
  "We certainly wish to preserve everything positive that has 
been achieved over the decades in our relations and make efforts 
toward the further development of our cooperation," Marrti 
Ahtisaari said. He noted that the Russo-Finnish bilateral 
agreements had been put together in such a way that they 
corresponded to the new situation that had arisen since the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, when Russia took its place 
as Finland's eastern neighbor. Difficulties had arisen in 
economic cooperation between the two countries at that time, but 
events had taken an abrupt turn for the better last year, the 
Finnish president said. The agreements that had already been 
concluded and about which talks were still in progress would 
assist in the creation of stability in this development, he 
noted. 
  The Finnish president noted the need to make every effort to 
further develop and strengthen international cooperation and 
disarmament, which promote world security. Finland will 
continue to make its contribution toward strengthening the 
structures of cooperation in Europe and settling conflicts that 
have deteriorated to the point of armed clashes, he assured his 
listeners. 
  The head of the Finnish state voiced the hope that relations 
between Russia and the new independent Baltic states will soon 
become stable and good. 
  The Finnish president expressed his sincere gratitude to the 
Russian president for the hospitality shown him in Moscow. He 
proposed a toast to good relations between Finland and Russia 
and to the happiness of the people of Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, 19 May -- Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari 
has just left Moscow. On the last day of his official visit to 
the Russian capital he met with Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan 
Rybkin, chairmen of the two chambers of the Russian Federal 
Assembly. 
  During yesterday's talks, Martti Ahtisaari and Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin discussed about 20 questions concerning 
bilateral relations and international affairs. 
  "There are no political problems between Russia and 
Finland;" 
this is how Boris Yeltsin described the outcome of the talks. 
Both countries' points of view on international problems, 
including the Yugoslav crisis, coincide, he noted. 
  On Thursday, M. Ahtisaari had a meeting with Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. During the conversation they 
discussed bilateral commercial and economic cooperation and the 
Russian regions' more active involvement in partnership with 
Finland.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Russian parliament lower house 
speaker Ivan Rybkin and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who 
met at the lower house on Thursday, expressed satisfaction with 
the development of relations between the two neighbouring 
countries. 
  Russian-Finnish contacts, including those at the 
parliamentary level, will develop in future too. Rybkin 
informed the high guest that Russian people wait with interest 
for a visit to Moscow by the Finnish parliament speaker. 
  The sides pointed to the importance of developing further 
economic cooperation between the two states, which, as they put 
it, should be given a boost. The president displayed interest 
in how investment legislation progresses in Russia. "The 
question of guarantees is of top priority for us," he noted. 
  Rybkin described the economic and political situation in the 
country to the president, stressing that "it was not an easy 
thing for us to adopt" the Social Accord Treaty. 
  He noted that it was fathered by the State Duma (lower 
house) 
which adopted a decision on economic and political amnesty last 
February. 
  "When the process was joined by the president who buttressed 
it with his prestige, the cause of consolidation picked up much 
more speed," he said. 
  "We in the State Duma supported the government's unpopular 
measures by adopting a very tense federal budget for this year 
in the first reading and made this move consciously," Rybkin 
said, stressing that "we should bear the burden of our reforms 
together with the government". 
  "It is important that social accord was reached and that 
cooperation between the two arms of Russian Government is 
successfully developing," Ahtisaari said. "I had the same 
impression after my talks with Boris Yeltsin and Viktor 
Chernomyrdin," the president added.

  [TYext] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Finnish President Martti 
Ahtisaari was on an official visit to Moscow on May 18-19 at the 
invitation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. During the visit 
an intensive dialogue on bilateral and other important regional 
and international problems was held. 
  The Russian president's press service reported that the two 
presidents noted with satisfaction the succession of 
good-neighborly relations and the absence of problems of 
political character in the relations between the two neighboring 
countries. The talks showed a high degree of confidence 
characteristic of Russo-Finnish relations and confirmed that the 
relations between the two countries are stable and are not 
subject to any political fluctuations. 
  During the talks and meetings problems of trade and economic 
cooperation between the two countries were discussed. The sides 
pointed out a common desire to look for mutually acceptable 
solutions of problems which appeared in this field -- the 
diversification of trade and the Russian debt to Finland. 
  The soonest solution of these problems should be promoted by 
stepping up the work of intergovernment mechanisms of bilateral 
cooperation -- the Russo-Finnish intergovernment commission for 
economic cooperation, the group for promoting the development of 
cooperation between adjoining regions and commissions for 
technical, scientific and ecological cooperation. 
  While discussing the situation in the north-European region 
the Russian and Finnish sides pointed out a high level of 
stability in this part of the continent and confirmed their 
mutual desire to strengthen stability by stepping up the 
activities of structures for regional cooperation -- the Council 
of the Baltic Sea States and the Council of the Barents and 
Euro-Arctic Region. 
  The Finnish side was thoroughly informed about the state of 
Russo-Baltic relations and prospects for their development. 
  The sides exchanged opinions on prospects for the European 
economic integration. It was pointed out that it is necessary 
to take steps to adapt a mechanism of Russo-Finnish interaction 
to new conditions in light of preparations of a Russo-EC 
agreement on partnership and cooperation and a possibility of 
Finland's membership in the European Union. 
  Separate discussions were devoted to the progress of reforms 
in Russia. The high-ranking Finnish guest was informed about 
the present stage of economic transformations in the country and 
difficulties encountered by the Russian people in the process of 
renewal. The Finnish side expressed support to the course aimed 
at democratisation and the development of the market economy and 
its readiness to render practical assistance to the solution of 
existing problems. 
  During the visit to Moscow President Ahtisaari met with 
Chairman of the Russian Government Viktor Chernomyrdin and 
chairmen of the two chambers of the Federal Assembly of the 
Russian Federation, Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan Rybkin. 
  Finnish Foreign Minister Haavisto who accompanied the 
Finnish 
president during the visit had substantial talks with his 
Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Andrey Palarya and Sergey </F>
Ostanin] 
  [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- U.N. military commanders in 
the former Yugoslavia have allocated several positions for 
Russian officers who will take them up this autumn, according to 
airborne troop commander Colonel-General Vladimir Podkolozin. 
  Podkolozin said on Wednesday that at first U.N. commanders 
offered Russian officers six secondary positions. "This could 
not satisfy us. We insisted on one key position -- deputy 
sector commander and received a positive answer. Russian 
officers will take up the posts this autumn," he said. 
  Podkolozin said that the 1,500-strong Russian contingent in 
the former Yugoslavia will be replaced by a new one in October. 
Under the contract, soldiers can stay in the war zone not 
longer than six months, officers -- a year. They may prolong 
their contracts for another six months if they wish so. 
  Podkolozin also said that Russia paid off its 1.5 billion 
U.S. dollar debt to the United Nations by participating in U.N. 
peace-keeping operations in the former Yugoslavia. Russian 
peace-keepers oversee cease-fire, prevent illegal arms exports 
and control troop movement. 
  Over two years of participation in the U.N. contingent in 
the 
former Yugoslavia five Russian soldiers were killed and 17 
wounded. 
  Russian soldiers in Yugoslavia receive 833 dollars a month, 
warrant officers 874-877 dollars and officers 915-1,008 dollars.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Khokhlov report: "Mission Repays a Debt"] </F>
  [Text] Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of 
Airborne Troops, held a news conference yesterday on the 
problems of Russian peacemaking [mirotvorchestvo] in the "hot 
spots" of the world and the CIS. He reported that during their 
two-year stay in the former Yugoslavia the Russian "blue berets" 
have conscientiously "worked off" almost the whole of Russia's 
debt to the United Nations: Just $200 million is outstanding 
from the previous $1.5 billion. 
  But Russia's power structures have still not drawn up a 
system of social protection for the peacemakers. In the opinion 
of the UN administration, they are the best of all the soldiers 
in Vukovar and Sarajevo today, but for some reason it is only 
the motherland that forgets that its sons are not out for a 
stroll but are at war.... 
  The Airborne Troops' commander has no information about 
sending new Russian military contingents to other countries, 
particularly Rwanda. The question of sending peacemakers to 
Nagorno-Karabakh also remains problematic: First the troops of 
the sides engaged in the conflict must be separated.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "Duma and Senate Vote Against </F>
Their Presidents -- But This Is Unlikely To Affect Situation in 
Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Washington -- At the same time as the Russian 
parliament's lower house -- the State Duma -- voted in favor of 
lifting the embargo on trade with Yugoslavia, the upper house of 
the U.S. Congress -- the Senate -- spoke out in favor of lifting 
restrictions on the sale of weapons to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Both 
in Moscow and Washington a further step has been taken toward 
the position expounded by former U.S. Secretary of State 
Eagleburger to the effect that, if people are firmly intent on 
killing one another, then everybody else has to stand aside and 
grant the belligerent parties freedom of action until their 
ardor abates. 
  The economic blockade established by decision of the United 
Nations affects Serbia and Montenegro. It does not apply to 
Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia. 
  However, all former SFRY countries find themselves under 
strict observation in the matter of weapons deliveries. Experts 
believe that this embargo is advantageous to Serbia and places 
its rivals in a known losing position. This concerns Bosnia in 
particular, insofar as Yugoslavia's entire defense industry is 
concentrated in Serbia and, to a lesser degree, in Croatia. 
  Recent reports that the Iranian Government, in conjunction 
with those of certain other Muslim states, has been secretly 
supplying weapons to the Bosnian Government -- led, as it is, by 
fellow believers -- placed American legislators in a somewhat 
awkward position. Iran is still on the blacklist of countries 
which, according to information from the U.S. State Department, 
support international terrorism. 
  However, on Capitol Hill, where the dome of the famous 
Congress Building rises over Washington, irritation over the 
half-hearted and inconsistent foreign policy of the Clinton 
administration has long been evident. 
  This concerns not only the Bosnians, whose sufferings and 
tortures have long since become not so much an indictment of 
Clinton's indecisiveness as a weapon in the hands of his 
political opponents. The views of the president and a great 
many legislators also differ over the thrust of the crisis in 
Haiti, and the means through which to avert the highly likely 
appearance of nuclear weapons in North Korean hands. 
  Alongside the number of senators and congressmen supporting 
the continuation of trade-related most-favored-nation status for 
China, despite its leaders harsh suppression of any political 
opposition, the ranks of those pushing for trade sanctions 
against China are swelling. 
  Russia, having long been almost the only spot on the 
political map to enjoy the conciliation and accord of all the 
main U.S. political forces, is also becoming a trouble spot. 
Clinton is being criticized for overly blatant pro-Russianism 
and malleability in implementing NATO's Partnership for Peace 
program in granting Russia, the critics claim, a special right 
of veto on the full-fledged entry into NATO of certain former 
Warsaw Pact members. 
  In voting by an overwhelming majority to halt the embargo on 
the delivery of arms to Bosnia, the Senate took "an easy, 
no-cost decision." Naturally, it avoids the introduction of 
American troops into the zone of hostilities, and even air 
strikes, all of which are fraught with possible losses of 
American lives. However, the prospect of the implementation of 
both resolutions -- that of the Russian Duma and the American 
Senate -- is not completely inoffensive. The appearance of 
heavy weaponry on the Bosnian side will jeopardize French, 
British, Ukrainian, and Russian lives, and will quite likely 
lead to their speedy withdrawal from Yugoslavia. 
  The history of democracy has demonstrated time and again 
that 
the implementation of foreign policy cannot be realized by 
parliamentary ballot, even if the fantasy of an irreproachable 
parliament is brought into play. So it is not difficult to 
predict that both governments, Russian and American alike, will 
try to hide behind polite smiles their irritation at the 
legislators' interference in the prerogatives of the executive. 
  During the Cold War, the lines of the division of interests 
were drawn so clearly that there was little room for opinions 
beyond the bounds of a simple "yes" and "no." Now everything is 
blurred, the majority of regional conflicts are notable for 
their striking complexity, and the involvement therein of the 
superpowers does not bode well. Which is why American 
legislators are criticizing the administration without 
counterposing their own positive programs. 
  The reasons for this modesty are clear. First, a positive 
program has to be answered for -- and certainly before the 
elections. Second, the Americans, like the Russians, are 
becoming less and less interested in foreign policy, giving 
preference to problems closer to home.

<F P=106> [Video report by Sergey Suntsov; from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Suntsov] Until quite recently there was no 
clear-cut policy on personnel matters. But with the formation 
within the president's office of a council on personnel policy 
-- whose membership includes the chairmen of both houses of the 
Federal Assembly -- this situation has changed, Vladimir 
Shumeyko told journalists today. The journalists asked him to 
comment on the resignation of Sergey Shakhray and to explain how 
this might affect policy on interethnic problems. 
  [Shumeyko] I only hope that with Yegorov's appointment to 
this post all these problems can move on from the phase of 
theoretical assessment to the phase of practical solutions, 
quite independent of the interests of the PRES [Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord]. 
  [Suntsov] New Minister Nikolay Yegorov hails from the same 
area as Vladimir Shumeyko. He is Shumeyko's man. Vladimir 
Shumeyko commented on this positive fact. He said that he had 
participated in the formation of the government on one single 
occasion, in December 1992. On that occasion, on instructions 
from the president, he helped Viktor Chernomyrdin draw up the 
government list. 
  [Shumeyko] Since then I have not taken part in the formation 
of the government. As far as my relations with the president 
are concerned, they are exactly as close as they need to be in 
order to facilitate joint work on affairs of state. 
  [Suntsov] Journalists also asked about the possibility that 
former Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov, who is now a deputy in 
the State Duma, might become chairman of the Central Bank of 
Russia. That is unlikely to happen in the near future Vladimir 
Shumeyko said. The chairman of the Federation Council feels 
there is no need at the moment for emergency measures to boost 
the economy. Only culture and science need active support from 
the authorities, he said. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko told journalists about bills sponsored by 
the government and Federation Council that envisage assistance 
for newspapers and publishing houses. Whereas the government 
plans to reduce profits tax by 50 percent and VAT to 6 percent, 
the Shumeyko draft proposes the abolition of all levies on the 
press, except for commercial and pornographic publications.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Zorkin, leader of "Accord for </F>
Russia" movement and former chairman of Russian Federation 
Constitutional Court, by Zhanna Kasyanenko; place and date not 
given: "Stop Lying to the People"] 
  [Text] Valeriy Zorkin, former chairman of the 
Constitutional Court, was the first person to publicly proclaim 
the unconstitutional nature of presidential edict No. 1400 
literally a few hours after Yeltsin's televised address 
[concerning the suspension of parliament and introduction of 
special rule] That move cost him not only his post. He had 
also to withstand threats, numerous attacks, press libel, and 
unwarranted accusations by his propresidential colleagues on the 
Constitutional Court itself. Now, six months later, this same 
Valeriy Zorkin is the initiator and one of the leaders of the 
"Accord for Russia" movement. What kind of accord does he have 
in mind, and with whom? Is it possible in our country at all 
today? 
  [Zorkin] I am very keen to ensure that nobody should confuse 
concepts such as accord and appeasement. There is and can be no 
accord between a criminal and his victim -- the person robbed 
and the robber cannot agree, and still less is it possible to 
agree on something with someone who has taken a life. Maybe my 
interpretation of the evangelical formula "Whosoever shall smite 
thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also" will strike 
you as unusual, but in my view it applies only to those who did 
this unintentionally, certainly not to an enemy or a criminal. 
Does Russia's history itself not confirm this? When enemies 
came, Russian people did not bow their heads before them but 
fought. For there have been a number of critical moments in our 
great history when we seemed to be approaching the very limit, 
the very brink, but we won just the same! Let us ask this 
question: Thanks to what? Thanks to the pooling of everyone's 
efforts and the merging of the will of individual citizens into 
the united will of the entire people -- in other words, thanks 
to accord. This is the kind of accord I mean. It is not an 
accord between a dispossessed people and the criminal power but 
an agreement within the people themselves, a kind of citizens' 
social charter. Its purpose is, on the basis of measures worked 
out by the people, to move away from the abyss into which we are 
all sliding. 
  [Kasyanenko] It seems to me that today we have already 
gotten too far away from the line beyond which political and 
directly related economic phenomena were still reversible.... 
  [Zorkin] Despite the fact that I hate it when people bang 
their fist or raise their voice, despite the fact that I am an 
opponent of radicalism and, all the more so, of barricades, I am 
forced to admit that without tough measures we cannot instill 
order in the country today or tomorrow. Order is the first of 
the conditions that are necessary to end the country's free fall 
into the abyss. For it is impossible to watch the escalation of 
crime, the collapse of industry, and the demise of agriculture. 
In the space of two or three years we have almost halved meat 
production and reduced the cattle population, simply butchered 
it, including the pedigree, elite cattle. Is this not a 
national disaster? Every ordinary peasant understands that it 
will take more than one year to restore what has been lost. So 
why does the government not understand it? We are told -- it is 
because of the imperfection of economic relationships. But I 
will start with something else -- because the authorities have 
not ensured that elementary order of ties which it must maintain 
and implement. These are the ties between city and countryside, 
between producer and processor, and between suppliers. 
  [Kasyanenko] You quite frequently encounter facts like 
these, for example: A producer is paid 150 rubles [R] for a 
liter of milk, the dairy makes as much, if not more, out of this 
liter, and [retail] trade makes more again. As a result, we buy 
a liter of milk for R400-500 or more, the smallest proportion of 
which goes to the one who worked for long months to produce it. 
Here you cannot help thinking not just about our Russian 
disorganization and muddle but about a well-organized disorder 
which is advantageous to the authorities. 
  [Zorkin] Of course, nothing will come of the economy until 
there is normal people's power free from corrupt officialdom, 
which today has become a veritable national disaster. Order 
presupposes the curbing of corruption in the power apparatuses 
themselves. Power must serve not itself but the people and guard 
and protect them. Otherwise the power becomes alienated from 
the people, as we have been seeing for the past two years. We 
must stop lying to the people and say openly what we have ended 
up with. We have ended up with a criminal, corrupt, antipeople 
state. 
  Therefore, accord for Russia is not an appeal to live 
amicably in the spirit of Leopold's cat [reference to popular 
cartoon character]; it must be the people's accord in a united 
demand -- to restore the power's responsibility and capability 
and, on this basis, to gamble on national priorities in 
everything: in industry, in agriculture, in culture. For 
Western aid represents fairy tales for children. Everyone 
pursues his own interest. It is in the West's interests to turn 
us into a colony, into a cheap raw materials market and a dump 
for the world's production waste. We are already being turned 
into a colony. All the signs are there. English is becoming the 
second language in our country, and the dollar the dominant 
currency. According to certain information, approximately $50 
billion is circulating within the country. Those who either 
work in commercial structures geared mainly to the West or who 
serve the mafia live well in our country. All the rest are 
plunging into poverty. Our national culture is being lost. A 
certain cacophony of destruction reigns in the country. 
  And yet we have a very rich history and country and a 
splendid people -- supersensitive and supersincere. We must 
turn to the roots from which we grew and go our own way without 
copying anyone. The peasant commune, for example, is a 
primordial Russian institution. Is it not the linchpin of the 
collectivism inherent in our people? Without it the Russian 
person becomes a part of the crowd or an isolated grain of sand, 
certainly not a constituent part of the people's original life. 
  Thus, in my view the main, basic principles must be order, 
people's power, and national priorities in the economy and in 
culture. We base accord on the principles which stem from 
reason, from the people's soul. As you see, they are nonparty 
principles and can be reduced to a single denominator -- the 
principles of patriotism, enlightened patriotism, I would say. 
  [Kasyanenko] It is difficult to object to anything here. 
They really are fine principles. But what about the mechanism 
for realizing them? 
  [Zorkin] This mechanism aimed at changing the situation must 
be systemic, since the crisis which has hit the country is 
precisely of a systemic nature. It is impossible to change the 
situation of the miners without changing the situation in the 
whole country. It is impossible to help the peasant without 
having resolved the problems of the energy complex or the 
machine-building complex. Measures to surmount the crisis must 
be based on the people's trust, and the people must be aware of 
them and support them. "Accord for Russia" is not a contract 
among a few people in Moscow nor their contract with the people. 
Everyone must understand that he must not be a blind tool in 
the hands of the authorities and that his passivity and 
nonresistance merely deepen the abyss and open up the way for 
those who wish to assert their radical course and impose their 
aggressiveness on society. People today undoubtedly find it 
hard to fathom out who is who, because the radicalism of the 
mass media, particularly television, does not allow them to form 
an objective opinion of what is happening. But there is the 
Duma, which constitutes a certain cross section of society, and 
there are the regions, whose interests are virtually identical. 
On this basis it is necessary to strive for order and the 
stabilization of the institutions of power and then carry out 
those transformations in the economy which will benefit the 
people and Russia. 
  [Kasyanenko] Do you believe that the president, the 
government, and the power structures will agree to -- or will 
permit -- a change of course? 
  [Zorkin] The ideal, of course, would be to hear confession 
and a statement that a wrong, antipeople course was chosen and 
that they are prepared to change it, to heed the people's 
opinion, and to act in the future only for the good of Russia. 
This would mean pulling back from the abyss in a peaceful, 
bloodless, and civilized manner. 
  We can see on the basis of our own experience that 
transformations should not be entrusted to one person without a 
team vested with the people's trust. The present collective 
Rasputin can be countered today only by some capable organ, call 
it what you like -- collective president, state council, etc. 
Naturally, it must be headed by a leader, but he is obliged to 
accede to power not with domestic servants but with a team of 
authoritative people representing the main political spectrum of 
society. This is the only way to achieve accord. Collective 
leadership does not mean evading responsibility but creating a 
mechanism which enables us to unite various movements and 
parties in a single congregational organism responsible for its 
actions not to foreign experts but to the motherland and the 
people. One person cannot assume the responsibility of deciding 
for the whole people, as is done in our practice and as was the 
case with the Belovezhskaya Forest troika, for example. 
  [Kasyanenko] Valeriy Dmitriyevich, certain so-called 
"democratic" mass media constantly run the topic of the 
president's health, and in this connection, for some reason, 
frequently on the same page, they discuss the question of his 
possible successors, early elections, etc. I have even read 
that your involvement with the "Accord for Russia" movement 
marks the start of your election campaign. 
  [Zorkin] Let such allegations remain on the conscience of 
those who make them. In general, this represents one more 
attempt to brand the opposition and those people who really want 
to do something for the motherland. I personally cannot imagine 
myself as president, and I am dubious about the way aspirants in 
general are appearing. When the roof of a building is on fire, 
it is suicidal to think about which chair it is best to sit in. 
Both the chair and the person sitting in it will burn. For me 
the question of who will fulfill a package of measures blessed 
and supported by the people is secondary. The chief thing is 
that it should be fulfilled. 
  [Kasyanenko] The initiators of the "Accord for Russia" 
movement were leaders of the opposition and of the patriotic 
forces, very different people who were interesting in their own 
way but who had hitherto acted separately. What helped you to 
unite? 
  [Zorkin] Life and destiny. Theoretically, this should have 
been done considerably earlier. Then, maybe, what we have now 
would not have happened. I believe that life, in the end, will 
make not only the opposition unite but also the former union 
republics. For we were like a single living organism which 
found itself destroyed. As a result, everyone acquired very 
similar problems. Why should everyone resolve them on his own 
and keep to his own segment when this can be done more 
successfully by uniting on terms acceptable to all? Any 
division or disunity is always the result of someone's 
arrogance, whatever reasons are used to cover this up. The 
sooner this is understood in Russia and in other republics, the 
better it will be for everyone. 
  [Kasyanenko] In conclusion, Valeriy Dmitriyevich, please 
tell our readers what connections you have with the countryside. 
  [Zorkin] I believe that there are very few Russian people 
whose roots are not connected somehow with the land. My own 
grandmother, mother, and other relatives used to live in a 
village in Tambov Oblast. I attended my first three classes in 
a rural school. They were the hard postwar years. The 
countryside fed us with goosefoot, rotten potatoes, and black 
bread, but it did not let us die. But there was war, 
devastation, and general grief then. I very much want us not to 
end up with no awareness of our past and not to forget about our 
roots and the land which nurtured us.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Petrenko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Russia's airports are working 
as usual from Thursday morning. Wednesday's strike of airline 
pilots, involving three per cent of all the crews, has been 
suspended. On Thursday, a delegation of the union of pilots is 
to meet officials from the Labour Ministry at the ministry's 
headquarters. The meeting is expected to consider the pilots' 
demands. 
  "We have postponed the action until June 2 to make another 
attempt to find a common language with the ministries and 
departments which can solve our problems", Alfred Malinovsky, 
leader of the union, told ITAR-TASS. "The negotiations will 
focus on safety of pilots and pensions for the airline staffs. 
Now the pension benefit of an airline veteran comes to only 65 
thousand roubles. By the way, we do not demand extra funds from 
the state budget - we are ready to contribute the bulk to the 
pension fund", Malinovsky said. 
  The pilots believe the problems of job cuts are not of less 
importance. The current state of affairs does not rule out 
dismissal of some eight thousand best-skilled pilots aged from 
27 to 37 years. This may lead to a sharp growth in crashes. 
The pilots propose to creat a foundation of airline personnel 
employment which will care for provision of jobs for the most 
experienced personnel. 
  On Thursday, the Moscow municipal court is to consider the 
action brought by the office of the Russian prosecutor-general 
against the union of pilots. According to the action, the 
strike must be declared illegal. The case was to be heard on 
Wednesday, but the hearing was postponed because the union's 
representatives did not turn up.

<F P=106> [Article by State Duma Deputy (and former Finance Minister) </F>
Boris Fedorov: "Economy in Wake of Accord Treaty"] 
  [Text] The recent signing of the Accord Treaty, in which 
many political groups did not participate for different reasons, 
while others cast doubts on its effectiveness, has prompted some 
sad thoughts about the fate of economic reform. 
  The actual signing confirmed yet again that there was never 
any confrontation in Russia between reformers and antireformers, 
as was often suggested to the uninitiated. The struggle for 
power does not always mean the same thing as the struggle for 
reform. 
  If we think about it, economic reform in the USSR and Russia 
in recent years came about more in spite of rather than thanks 
to the ruling groups. Specific economic interests have to be 
sought for everything, and real reforms always lead to a loss of 
administrative power for nomenklaturas of any stripe. 
  The economic reforms in Russia today have run ahead of 
society's political maturity, which at a certain phase 
inevitably leads to equilibrium being restored through a serious 
crisis. It is no accident that the "Chinese experience" is so 
popular in certain circles -- everyone thinks of its economic 
side, when what they really mean is the political side. 
  Meanwhile Russian statehood is under deadly threat from the 
crisis of central power, the destructive activity of a number of 
regional elites, and the criminalization of society. And the 
interests of our statehood are being sacrificed for the sake of 
the struggle for an increasingly ephemeral power. All this 
inevitably leads to the appearance of phenomena such as V. 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  Another factor in instability is the damage being done to 
the 
democratic movement in Russia in the broad sense of the word. 
Every second person is a presidential contender, and the rest 
are geniuses. The evolution of political and economic views on 
the part of a number of leading democratic politicians is 
striking, and there is no limit to their personal ambition. 
  Is there any real possibility of some kind of peace? In my 
view, we must agree with G. Yavlinskiy: If illegal or simply 
violent methods are used, then this is a matter for the 
law-enforcement organs. If these are legitimate measures in the 
political struggle, then no accords will help. Political 
opponents are hardly likely to give up the struggle for power. 
  What are the prospects for economic reform in this context? 
To my mind, signing or failure to sign will not affect the 
reforms, since the treaty's provisions are vague in the extreme 
and are not aimed at accelerating reform. Equally, it is time 
we recognized that reforms are never carried out anywhere with 
the consent of all and sundry. That is a fairytale. Somebody 
has to take responsibility. 
  This responsibility lies primarily with the executive and 
the 
president. Parliament, with its current factionalism and the 
executive's attitude toward it, is incapable of making the 
breakthrough. 
  The loyalty shown by flexible ministers is rewarded by 
awarding them extraordinary vice premier titles; for signing the 
treaty some (like Travkin) have received ministerial portfolios, 
while others have obtained trillions under a "clarified" budget. 
Where is the reform in that? 
  Nonetheless, I remain convinced that this time too it is 
worth voting for the budget along with the happy Agrarians and 
Communists, but without the Gaydar Democrats. But for a 
different and simpler reason. 
  Yes, the budget is bad and absolutely unrealistic. Yes, the 
actual deficit will be nearer 50 percent of budget expenditure 
than 36 percent. 
  But this budget is at least not the disaster which sectoral 
lobbyists were ready to organize at any minute. It would be 
hard to expect anything better from the current government. We 
will probably have a new wave of inflation in three months' 
time, but, I trust, it will not be an explosion. 
  But the most important thing is that the government's hands 
are bound by legislative fetters and it will be very easy to 
verify its fulfillment of its obligations. Any expenditure 
decision over and above the budget will be illegal. The 
government itself, if it wants to retain its freedom of action, 
will find it advantageous to reject the budget. It will now be 
impossible for agrarian and other lobbyists to demand any 
further increase in appropriations. 
  God willing, what has been submitted will be fulfilled. In a 
few months' time everything will be clear, and it will be 
possible to pass a verdict of confidence or no-confidence in the 
government.

"Government Promises to Ease Taxes for Small Businesses. Local 
Authorities Not Averse to `Redistributing' Them in Their Own 
Favor"] 
  [Text] Addressing a seminar on the problems of low-level 
enterprise that opened yesterday, Leonid Bochin, chairman of the 
Russian Federation State Committee on Antimonopoly Policy, 
declared that "since entrepreneurs are not to expect large-scale 
direct credits from the budget," the main state support for 
small businesses will consist in "considerable tax breaks and 
freeing from spending on social infrastructure." Minister of 
the Economy Aleksandr Shokhin confirmed that "lifting the burden 
of outlays for housing, health services, etc.," would be one of 
the main areas of "post-privatization state support for 
businesses." 
  The economy minister stated that a "Council for Economic 
Reform" will soon be set up, consisting of representatives of 
executive power and Federation Council deputies. The Council 
"in the context of the Treaty on Social Accord" will create a 
"working conciliation mechanism," and, in particular, will 
develop a new concept of tax policy. Aleksandr Shokhin hopes 
that the Council's experts will manage to draft proposals before 
the State Duma looks at a Tax Code. 
  The economy minister promised that two weeks from now, a 
draft law "On State Support for Small Non-State Enterprises" 
will be put before the government. The government proposes to 
prepare in the second quarter draft amendments to the law "On 
Enterprise and Entrepreneurial Activities." They will deal with 
state guarantees for the rights of entrepreneurs and provide for 
simplified registration procedures for entrepreneurs who are not 
legal entities. 
  Aleksandr Shokhin underscored that the rise of small 
businesses depends to a considerable degree on the good will of 
the regional authorities. Today the seminar's "roundtable" will 
be discussing possible interaction between federal and regional 
bodies to develop small businesses. Already yesterday there 
emerged one of the topics of the discussion -- the leaders of 
territories are asking the center "to redistribute the bulk of 
business taxes in favor of local authorities."

  [Text] Ulyanovsk May 18 TASS -- First Vice-Premier of the

safety of flights and the condition of the aviation industry 
during his visit to the "Avesta" joint stock society on 
Wednesday. 
  He pointed out that plans made by foreign companies to enter 
the Russian market are becoming a reality. "Foreign planes are 
directly purchased and leased from abroad which means that we 
are beginning to lose the CIS market," Soskovets said. 
  The director general of the Aviastar joint stock society, 
Viktor Mikhailov, said the auctioning with the involvement of 
other investors had failed to produce the desire economic 
effect. According to Mikhailov, part of the planned credit 
allocated by the state was used for new technologies. "The 
shortage of completing parts remains one of the worst problems 
today," Mikhailov said.

correspondent Yevgeniy Nikitin specially for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: 
date, place not given: "We Make High-Class Engines. But We Are 
Unable To Sell Them"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Nikitin] What is aircraft 
engine manufacturing doing to maintain the state's lofty status? 
  [Chuyko] Aeroengine manufacturing is enabling us to make 
scientific developments. The developments used in a military 
engine are used five years later in a passenger aircraft and in 
another five years in gas-turbine engines, in nuclear power 
engineering, shipbuilding, gas pumping, etc. Aviation science 
gives rise to new areas of industry and agriculture. More 
precise calculations are used along with new methods of 
technological processing and new equipment. And all that 
provides work for metallurgists, instrument manufacturers.... 
We are currently manufacturing around 200,000 mini-tractors and 
cultivators for agriculture. 
  [Nikitin] What do you consider the main conditions for the 
development of aircraft engine manufacturing? 
  [Chuyko] The main thing for us today is to formulate a 
national aviation policy. We need to secure state backing for 
science and for aircraft production and operation, focus efforts 
on ensuring flight safety, and bear in mind all the features 
involved in the privatization of defense complex enterprises. 
We must make up our minds what we actually want.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Dudnikov report: "Oilmen Killing Off Wells. </F>
Because of Debts"] 
  [Text] Yamalo-Nenetsk and Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous 
Okrugs -- Sabotage against oilmen. That is how V. Gorodilov, 
general director of the "Noyabrskneftegaz" Joint-Stock Company, 
views the situation that has developed with regard to black gold 
in Russia. How else you can explain the fact that Russia is 
turning down a highly valuable raw material that is the 
country's main source of revenue? 
  All the main pipelines are full of oil, but the refineries 
do 
not want it. The Omsk Oil Refinery, for instance, which usually 
used to take 60,000-70,000 tonnes of crude a day from the men of 
Noyabrskiy, has now "frozen" the amount at 30,000 tonnes. And 
it is quite possible that the emerging downward trend in Omsk's 
demand will continue. As a last resort the "Purneftegaz" and 
Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug fields are now pumping oil only 
four hours a day. 
  What does this oil policy mean for Russian citizens? The 
decline in refineries' receipts of crude oil will create a 
shortage of fuel and lubricants and increase their prices. What 
is the consumer to do -- in particular the agrarian sector, 
faced with the imminent sowing campaign? 
  Analyzing the prevailing situation, some mass media at the 
prompting of high-ranking officials are trying inter alia to 
heap all the blame for the soaring prices on the oilmen. But 
they are forced to say in their defense that, whereas the 
increase in food prices is keeping pace with inflation at 10-12 
percent, the price of production resources is up 40 percent. 
And that made them raise the price of the raw materials. Why 
am I using the past tense? Because the direct producers of oil 
have not been dictating anything to anyone since the beginning 
of the year. Inter alia in January the Noyabrskiy were getting 
80,000 rubles [R] per tonne and in February just over R60,000. 
  Incidentally, Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Yu. Shafranik 
recently asked V. Gordilov: How is the decree on cooperation 
with foreign firms in repairing wells being implemented? The 
answer from the well-known Russian specialist and head of a 
major oil production unit was unequivocal: For Russia, this 
cooperation does not pay. 
  When we use oil to settle up with foreign countries we 
receive equipment at a price inflated, according to some 
estimates, by as much as 100 percent. At the same time Russia's 
oilmen are becoming technologically dependent on foreign firms. 
And that is not all. In doing that we are destroying with our 
own hands a national industry geared to the production of 
equipment for the oil and gas industry.

<F P=106> ["Topical interview" with Igor Chekmezov, chief of Russian </F>
Federation State Grain Inspectorate, by Pavel Khomitskiy; place 
and date not given: "As You Were"] 
  [Text] The State Grain Inspectorate 
(Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya) was created in the Russian Federation 
at the end of April, directly subordinate to the government. 
Our correspondent talked with its chief -- Igor Chekmezov, 
chief state grain inspector of the Russian Federation. 
  [Khomitskiy] Igor Mefodyevich, why was the grain 
inspectorate created specifically under the government? For 
there was previously a similar organization under the former 
Committee for Grain Products of the Russian Federation Ministry 
of Trade and Material Resources, was there not? 
  [Chekmezov] Yes, there was. Throughout the 70 years of its 
existence this was a departmental service. But in August 1992, 
in accordance with a presidential edict, the state system of 
grain products started to be eliminated, shares in 
grain-reception, milling, and groat and mixed-feed enterprises 
were floated, and the committee which you mentioned was 
reorganized as the "Roskhleboprodukt" Joint-Stock Company, 
which, as a commercial structure, lost the functions of state 
control. Therefore the Russian Federation Law "On Grain" of 14 
May 1993 provided for the creation of the Roskhlebinspektsiya 
under the government. 
  [Khomitskiy] What will be the main functions of the 
inspectorate which you head? 
  [Chekmezov] It is no secret that 15-20 percent of the grain 
is lost on the way from the field to the consumer's table. 
Therefore our main concern today is to do the utmost to help 
reduce and prevent these losses by means of control over 
production quality and the rational utilization both of the 
grain itself and of the products of its processing. At all 
stages. Of course, we also will not lose sight of the 
transportation and storage of grain and oil seeds. 
  It has to be said that at the present time many 
organizations 
which have the money to get their laboratories accredited have 
secured the right to determine the quality of grain and of the 
products of its processing. It goes without saying that 
discrepancies in issuing descriptions of the selfsame 
consignments of grain by different structures are simply 
inevitable. A government decree has laid down that certificates 
and conclusions by the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya and its organs 
locally are obligatory for all legal and physical persons. 
  I wish to emphasize especially that we will carry out 
compulsory state inspections of the quality of grain, the 
products of its processing, and oil seeds being supplied for 
export, to regions of the Far North, and to military consumers 
and consumers equated with them, as well as of those being 
imported, with the appropriate certificates being issued. At 
the same time we alone will be exclusively responsible for 
inspecting the grain being exported. 
  One of our service's most important tasks in the future will 
be to elaborate proposals for shaping state policy in respect of 
grain and also to draw up the rules of a civilized grain market. 
  [Khomitskiy] How will your inspectorate be represented in 
the provinces? Who will finance it? 
  [Chekmezov] Territorial organs of the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya 
are being created in all the national formations, krays, and 
oblasts where there is commodity production of grain. The cost 
of maintaining them will be met out of the federal budget and 
from nonbudget sources. What is meant by the latter is our 
organs' rendering of paid services -- on a contract basis -- to 
all commercial structures conducting grain transactions. 
  [Khomitskiy] Peasant labor accounts for most of the labor 
in a grain product. But as for remuneration, the present 
so-called "market" leaves rural folk with not even a share but a 
tiny share of the proceeds from sales of grain or grain 
products. Does the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya intend somehow to 
promote the removal of this injustice? 
  [Chekmezov] Of course! In connection with the 
liberalization of the grain market various commercial 
organizations and private persons, who frequently seek to 
deceive the commodity producer, have begun making grain 
purchases. Therefore, at the request of the grain producer and 
on its own initiative, the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya will monitor 
the correct determination of the quality of grain in trade 
deals. Incidentally, we also intend to do the same when grain 
is delivered to elevators and grain-reception centers. 
  [Khomitskiy] Harvest time is not far off and, like the 
sowing campaign, it will require considerable energy sources. 
Does the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya intend to give the commodity 
producer any assistance in upholding the idea of parity for the 
prices of fuel and lubricants and of grain? 
  [Chekmezov] You know, it is my conviction that this would be 
fair. As for real assistance for peasants on our part, in this 
case, again, I see it as the task of our organs locally not to 
allow businessmen (but it would be more accurate to say rogues, 
who frequently hide behind this fashionable word) to cheat the 
rural commodity producer in barter deals (fuel and lubricants 
for grain) by means of artificially understating the quality 
and, accordingly, the price of the latter. 
  [Khomitskiy] In conclusion I will ask you to say a few words 
about yourself. 
  [Chekmezov] About myself.... To be brief, I will say this. 
After graduating from an agricultural institute, I traveled the 
path from agronomist to chief of a rayon agricultural 
administration, working on farms in Rostov Oblast's Morozovskiy 
and Milyutinskiy Rayons. 
  From 1975 I worked in the system of the USSR Ministry of 
Grain Products, becoming deputy director and then director of 
the Morozovsk Elevator, again in Rostov Oblast. In 1987 I was 
invited to work on the central apparatus of the USSR Ministry of 
Grain Products, and two years later I headed the State Grain 
Inspectorate under the USSR Council of Ministers State 
Commission for Foodstuffs and Purchases. For the past two years 
I led the Administration for Purchases of Grain and Oil Seeds of 
the Grain Products Committee of the Russian Federation Ministry 
of Trade and Material Resources and headed the "Zerno" Firm of 
the "Roskhleboprodukt" Federal Contract Corporation. 
  [Khomitskiy] Well, in that case you are the right man for 
the job, as they say. I thank you for the conversation and wish 
you success!

<F P=106> [Report from the Russian Federation Government Center for </F>
Economic Conditions: "Month of May to Blame"] 
  [Text] Over the past week inflation was 1 percent. 
Foodstuffs were up 1.9 percent, nonfood goods 1.2 percent and 
paid services to the population were up 1.9 percent. 
  Prices for goods and services grew most noticeably in the 
cities of Eastern Siberia, which recorded Russia's biggest rise 
in the price of foodstuffs and paid services to the population. 
The smallest change in consumer prices last week -- less than 1 
percent -- was recorded in the Northern Region. 
  Prices in the unofficial trading system continued to rise 
faster than in the official trading system. Price increases in 
Moscow for the main foodstuffs, nonfood goods, and services 
corresponded to the average Russian level; they were higher in 
St. Petersburg -- at 2.9 percent. 
  Spring is to blame -- specifically, the month of May. The 
seasonal increase in the cost of fruit and vegetables (by 11.9 
and 5.2 percent respectively) affected prices as a whole. 
Moreover, prices for meat products and salt were up more than 2 
percent over the week, while the price of dairy products, 
butter, vegetable oil, sugar, and flour increased by less than 1 
percent. The only things unaffected by the spring are chickens 
and alcohol producers -- egg and vodka prices were unchanged. 
  The average cost of the basket of a month's worth of the 19 
most important foodstuffs on 10 May was 49,700 rubles [R] -- up 
2.4 percent on the week and 4.4 percent since the start of the 
month. 
  The variation between the maximum and minimum cost of the 
basket in different Russian cities remained at last week's level 
-- 270 percent. 
  The most "expensive" area is still the Far East Economic 
Region -- the basket there cost R83,100 for the whole month. 
After a week's break, the "cheapest" area is once again the 
Central Chernozem Region -- R38,900. 
  Price growth for nonfood goods during this period has been 
minimal this year -- 1.2 percent. Notable increases continued 
to be recorded by matches (up 4 percent), wallpaper (up 3.8 
percent), and medicine (up 3 percent, including a 10-percent 
rise for nitroglycerin). 
  The cities of the Far East Region -- 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Nakhodka, Yakutsk, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, 
and Magadan -- are constantly on the list of the 10 cities with 
the highest price levels for certain types of nonfood goods. 
Thus, last week Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy was in the top 10 
most "expensive" cities for half of the 40 industrial goods 
surveyed, as was Nakhodka for 17, Yakutsk and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk 
for 14, and Magadan for 7.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Rytov report under the "Social Focus" rubric: "All </F>
the Same, the Prospects for the Harvest Are Unenviable"] 
  [Text] The other day I bought a pack of garlic from a 
nearby vegetable store. Removing the plastic wrapper at home, I 
discovered large, completely unspoilt bulbs. Where was this 
garlic from? From Argentina, my friends! 
  Well then, we have entered the world market with such speed 
that we can no longer produce anything. You see "Snickers" 
wherever you go: Have some -- no thanks.... 
  And how do matters stand with our own agricultural output? 
To put it mildly, not very well. According to Russian 
Federation State Committee for Statistics figures, as of 25 
April 2.3 million hectares (15 percent of the area sown) of 
winter crops on Russian Federation farms had perished. This 
includes 2.1 million hectares (15 percent) of grain crops. 
  And where have the winter crops perished? On our most 
fertile lands! In Voronezh Oblast half of all crops have 
perished. In Volgograd and Astrakhan Oblasts -- a third. In 
Krasnodar Kray -- 27 percent. 
  I asked the leading experts: What is the cause of this 
disaster? No one could give me satisfactory explanations. 
Unforeseen weather conditions, they suggested: There was a 
sharp frost, but there had been no snow.... The there are the 
mysterious subsoil waters, which suddenly changed their course. 
  OK. What about the spring crops? As is the custom, they 
have caught up and overtaken. Spring crops (as of 25 April) 
have been sown on an area of 5.2 million hectares. Of these 
cereal crops account for 3.7 million. Last year the 
corresponding figures were 4.0 million and 2.8 million hectares. 
  And more sugar beet has been sown than last year as well -- 
231,000 hectares, and more sunflower seed -- 260,000 hectares. 
(Last year the corresponding figures were 197,000 and 92,000 
hectares.) Add to this an increase of one-third in the area 
under potatoes and vegetables. 
  The figures do inspire some optimism. But here is how they 
are assessed by the experts from the Russian Federation 
Government Economic Conditions Center, which cannot be accused 
of prejudice. In their opinion, a 10-percent reduction in the 
output of eggs can be expected in the first half of this year 
compared with the same period last year, together with 
reductions in the production of meat and milk of 20 and 31 
percent respectively. The overwhelming majority of Russians 
will find it hard in such conditions to survive until the 
promised lavish harvest. 
  And will it be so lavish anyway? After all, it is not enough 
to grow a crop -- it must also be gathered, stored, and 
processed. Yet storage and processing capacity is hardly 
increasing at all. So the prospects for the new harvest will 
hardly be enviable.

  [Text] Irkutsk May 19 TASS -- The far-regional inspection 
for the protection of the freedom of the press and the mass 
media has suspended the newspaper RUSSKIY VOSTOK instituted by 
the local national patriotic movement Vernost. 
  The newspaper managers were notified that the newspaper was 
suspended for going beyond its goals and tasks outlined in its 
programme, which the newspaper did several times. The 
inspection declared that a recent publication containing insults 
against lawmakers of the Irkutsk regional legislative assembly, 
which was entitled "Thieves Have Won or New Regional Committee 
in Action", was aimed at flaring up social tension and 
intolerance, which violates Article 4 of the Russian Law on the 
Mass Media. 
  The newspaper, which is sold beyond the Far-Eastern region 
and practically has a nationwide status, will have to be 
re-registered in Moscow.

  [Text] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA readers have been surprised by 
the absence of any official reports on the appointment of 
Democratic Party of Russia leader Travkin as a Russian 
Government minister. 
  We have established why the editorial office has not 
received 
the official text of the Russian Federation president's edict. 
It was explained to us at the relevant President's Staff organs 
that our newspaper was not on the distribution list for this 
document. 
  Unfortunately, this is not the first instance of the 
editorial office's failing to receive certain official 
documents. We would like to recall once again that a procedure 
has been laid down whereby publication of Russian Federation 
presidential and government acts in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA is an 
official basis for the documents' coming into force. Just which 
negligent civil servants should be reminded of this?

  [Text] Two servicemen who stood guard on the weapon depot 
of the Russian Pacific Fleet air force have been arrested on 
suspicion of causing a fire there on May 14. 
  A spokesman for the Russian Prosecutor General's Office told 
Interfax that the men had been found to enter the store and try 
to extract certain parts from a missile. As they were doing 
this, there was a short circuit and the missile caught fire. 
They could not extinguish the fire which spread over the depot. 
  The military prosecutor's office is investigating the case 
under the Prosecutor General's Office supervision.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>
  [Text] Vladivostok May 18 TASS -- Pacific Fleet officers 
have appealed to Russian President Boris Yeltsin to reconsider 
the sacking of the fleet commander, Admiral Georgiy Gurinov. 
  The appeal was adopted today at a meeting of the officers of 
the fleets headquarters and administration. The message says 
that despite the complicated situation, especially after the 
blast at the fleet's ammunition storage facilities, Admiral 
Gurinov during his brief term of office succeeded in stopping 
the worsening of combat capability of the fleet's ships and 
units, stabilising the training, lowering the incidence of 
traumas and the rate of death among the servicemen. 
  The appeal stresses that Admiral Gurinov was attentive to 
the 
needs and interests of the servicemen while demanding discipline 
at all levels. This is why the officers and admirals of the 
Russian Pacific Fleet are sure that the fleet needs Admiral 
Gurinov as its commander, whose moral and professional authority 
is recognised by the force. 
  Admiral Gurinov was relieved of his duties on Tuesday, and 
Vice- Admiral Igor Khmelnov was appointed acting commander of 
the fleet. According to sources in the Russian Defence Ministry, 
the sacking came after President Boris Yeltsin's unwritten order.

<F P=106> [Report under "Details" rubric by Natalya Barabash: "First </F>
Victim of Maritime Kray Disaster Is Admiral Gurinov"; 
accompanied by Sergey Avdeyev report] 
  [Text] The catastrophic explosion at the Pacific Fleet 
ammunition dumps (KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA wrote about it yesterday) 
took place exactly two years to the day after the famous 
"fireworks" at the arsenal in Vladivostok. A coincidence? 
  Fire, as is known, is better than rain at removing all 
traces. At any rate, the people of Novonezhino are sure: "Look, 
it was the commander that did it.... He was selling guns, and 
now everything has gone sky-high," an old lady, Praskovya 
Ivanovna, lamented, as she was being evacuated with her meager 
goods and chattels from her now roofless little home. 
  Thefts of weapons are the most widespread crime in the 
military sphere. Dumps are poorly guarded, the buildings are 
old and dilapidated, and instead of barbed wire often all you 
find is a rickety fence. The results of the Vladivostok 
disaster have never been published. There were rumors of a fire 
to remove the evidence of thefts. There were some rather 
garbled reports about seamen dropping smoldering cigarette butts 
near projectiles. 
  The cigarette butts turned out to have a long fuse. What is 
being peddled now, two years on, is theories about the 
self-combustion of old projectiles, about a forest fire 
encroaching from the taiga.... 
  "There could not have been a forest fire. I flew over the 
explosion area myself in a helicopter and the only black traces 
of fire I could see were inside the dump. They did not cross 
the strip of forest in front of it," Maritime Kray 
Administration chief Ye. Nazdratenko said at a news conference. 
  But he refused to blame the fleet for what had happened, 
putting it all down to the rampaging democrats who had broken up 
the army. 
  But it is not the first time the Pacific Fleet has been the 
main cause of disasters in the Maritime Kray. The mushroom 
cloud over Chazhma Bay, the nuclear submarine that sank in 
Bolshoy Kamen -- all that was in the eighties. 
  In 1991 Vladivostok came under fire during trials of the 
guns 
mounted on the warship Admiral Vinogradov. The shells overshot 
the target and happened to expolode in the air above a 
residential district. Later, two navy aircraft exploded in the 
air as they were just reaching Vladivostok. 
  Maritime Kray is still literally crammed with military 
equipment -- there are still around 15 similar ammunition dumps 
there. One of them is in the very center of Vladivostok, on the 
densely populated Egersheld peninsula. The fleet leadership 
assures us that there is no possibility of its being removed. 
Unless, of course, there is some assistance from cigarette 
butts.... 
  Meanwhile Maritime Kray is counting the cost. According to 
the experts, there has been nothing in Russia before to compare 
with the disaster in Novonezhino. The dump (four kilometers 
long and 1.5 kilometers wide) is beyond recovery -- there is a 
massive gaping creater where it used to be. The remaining 
ammunition -- around 30 percent -- will be destroyed. Most of 
the houses in Novonezhino are beyond repair. Thousands of 
people were made homeless by the explosion and have now been 
moved to other parts of Maritime Kray. Hectares of sown land 
and neighboring villages have been showered with explosives. 
  So the kray leadership's optimistic statements about there 
being "no casualties" could be premature, alas. Only a week ago 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA wrote about a boy who was blown up by a 
shell left over from the explosion of two years ago.... 
[Barabash ends] 
  Sergey Avdeyev commentary: "Concerning Which" 
  Yesterday fleet commander Adm. Georgiy Gurinov was added to 
the list of victims. He was removed from his post by an edict 
of the Russian president "because of continuing serious 
incidents in the fleet entrusted to him and an overall decline 
in combat readiness, and for personal negligence in his work." 
  The dismissal of the commander, who had been in this post 
for 
a little over a year, in itself seems somewhat strange. How 
could the new admiral, appointed by an edict of the same 
president only recently, in such a short time have ruined a 
fleet which until recently was considered one of the best in the 
country? 
  Vice Admiral Igor Khmelnov has been appointed acting 
commander. While in no way doubting his professional 
capabilities and personal qualities, I will merely observe that 
when commenting on the lessons of the 1992 Vladivostok arsenal 
explosion Igor Nikolayevich gave the following firm assurance: 
From now on all fleet arsenals will be safe.

"Emergency Situations Ministry To Make Sunken Submarine Water- 
Proof"] 
  [Text] On Wednesday, the Russian Federation Ministry on 
the Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and the 
Elimination of Effects of Natural Disasters officially announced 
the date when the "Academician Keldysh" research ship will leave 
for the site where the "Komsomolets" nuclear submarine sank. 
Sergey Khetagurov, deputy minister of civil defense and 
emergency situations, said that the expedition will start out in 
Kaliningrad on 15 June. The "Academician Keldysh," which en 
route will also visit Denmark and Norway, will cast anchor on 1 
July at the site of the submarine's sinking. 
  The expedition has been tasked with constantly monitoring 
the 
environmental situation in the area of the submarine's demise 
and sealing its bow section. To this end, there are two deep-sea 
"Mir" bathyscaphes equipped with special on-board manipulators. 
According to Mr. Khetagurov, a total of $4.1 million and 1.5 
billion rubles has been allocated for carrying out the 
expedition from various financial sources. Its final aim, 
however, is to help draw up a large-scale federal program to 
prevent incidents with particularly dangerous objects in sea 
areas and to ensure rapid reaction in the event such incidents 
do occur.

  [Text] At the moment, more than 50 research nuclear 
reactors are functioning in Moscow, but none of them is equipped 
with safety accessories such as protection shields. 
Nevertheless, only three reactors of the Kurchatov research 
center have been closed down since 1992. To make matters worse, 
they are likely to be brought on-line again in the near future, 
the former head of the Moscow inspection unit of the State 
Atomic Supervision Committee (SASC), Vladimir Kuznetsov, told 
Interfax Wednesday. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, he said the 
situation with safety precautions on the territories of research 
centers in Moscow was "disastrous." 
  "The inspection revealed an awful lot of violations. For 
example, a reactor in the Kurchatov institute has been exploited 
at two times the capacity it was designed for. While halting 
another reactor in the Theoretical and Experimental Physics 
Institute, all its territory was contaminated, and radioactivity 
is likely to proliferate beyond its limits," he said. 
  Kuznetsov disagreed with the wide-spread opinion that 
research reactors are low-capacity, and that the contamination 
will not be serious in case of an accident. As many research 
centers, in particular, the Kurchatov Institute, were located 
within the city limits, an accident will lead to the 
contamination of homes, hospitals, kindergartens, etc. 
  Another participant of the news conference, employee of the 
SASC Research and Scientific Center Vladimir Moskalenko pointed 
to the "outrageous condition of technical equipment of the 
reactors." 
  He said the obligatory check for ionizing emanation was 
either neglected, or the equipment was so insensitive that the 
probes could not be correct. He also said there was practically 
no control of leakages of radioactive gases and aerosols to the 
atmosphere. 
  The former employees of the SASC sent an open letter to the 
State Duma and the Federation Council with a proposal to 
consider the inexpediency of further use of nuclear 
installations in Moscow due to a possible disaster.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin has declined to accept Sergey Shakhray's resignation, 
having found his arguments insufficient, Yeltsin's press 
secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov told a briefing here today. 
  The president instructed his staff to convey to Sergey 
Shakhray "a few critical remarks concerning his style of work 
and some personal qualities". The president, according to 
Kostikov, pointed to Sergey Shakhray's "political whimsicality 
and his desire to accumulate too many posts. The president 
observed Sergey Shakhray's personal political motives are not 
always correlated with Russia's interest". 
  Kostikov rejected categorically press allegations about the 
forthcoming sacking of Sergey Filatov as the president's chief 
of staff. According to the press secretary, Yeltsin said there 
can be no question about Sergey Filatov's resignation. 
  Kostikov said that rumours about the dismissal of such 
figures as Sergey Filatov are destabilising in character. "I 
have an impression that NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has no real sources 
in the presidential and governmental structures and often 
engages in improvisations," he stressed. Filatov was is and 
will be in the foreseeable future one of the president's closest 
employees, Kostikov said.

  [Text] Here on Mayak's "Panorama" program is a postscript 
to a recent event in the top echelons of power in Russia. The 
well-known politician and member of the State Duma, Sergey 
Stankevich, analyzes the reasons for Sergey Shakhray's 
resignation from the post of deputy prime minister. 
  [Begin Stankevich recording] I am convinced -- and this is 
not simply because I am in the same party, I have long been 
convinced -- that he is one of the most professional and 
hard-working members of our political and government team. Any 
departure by him from the government is undoubtedly a loss and 
undoubtedly signifies a weakening of the government and, 
incidentally, is a loss for Russians as well, because he acts 
calmly, sensibly, circumspectly, clearly, and, as a rule, quite 
effectively in so far as results can be achieved. 
  As far as his resignation is concerned, there is an economic 
component here as well as a political and a kind of 
group-personal component. Let's start with the economic one. 
This year Shakhray's department was allocated quite a 
considerable sum for the implementation of regional policy. 
Specifically, preferential government loans worth approximately 
seven trillion rubles were allocated for the regions of the 
North alone, and it was Shakhray's department that was to decide 
how these colossal funds were to be distributed, via which banks 
they would pass, and on which programs they would be spent. 
Before taking this very responsible decision, Shakhray inquired 
how this had been done previously and how trillions in 
government loans had been spent. I do not rule out the 
possibility that Shakhray's scrupulous and over-careful approach 
-- justifiably careful -- to this subject, could have made those 
who are used to not expending particular concern over very 
serious state loans nervous. 
  I would like to mention the political component. I am afraid 
that the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES] has now become 
the object of very jealous and malevolent attention. It looks 
as though someone is trying very hard to squeeze it out of the 
positions that it has occupied. Six key posts in the cabinet, 
four ministerial and two deputy prime minister posts, belonged 
to PRES, and, evidently, this was regarded as excessive by those 
political groupings that are also laying claim to a significant 
share of power. I do not rule out that it was their influence 
that was brought to bear here. 
  Finally, as for the personal issue. Shakhray is extremely 
sensitive about such aspects as professional ethics, human 
dignity, and the dignity of a political and state figure. When 
a minister is appointed to a ministry of which he, as deputy 
prime minister is supposed to be in charge, and he is not even 
consulted about the matter, that is something he could not 
ignore. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report in the "Ambitions" column: </F>
"Shakhray Does Not Want To Be Chernomyrdin's Deputy. Yet 
Another Resignation of the PRES Leader"] 
  [Text] Sergey Shakhray has tendered his resignation as 
deputy prime minister. The official reason is his dismissal as 
minister of nationalities and regional policy and the 
appointment of a successor "even without formal consideration 
for the opinion of the deputy prime minister in charge of these 
matters." Mr. Shakhray stated that his resignation "does not 
mean a move toward opposing the president or government, or any 
personal grudge." 
  The statement expresses the hope that the dismissal is not 
connected with the deputy prime minister's order about a 
financial inspection of the former State Committee for Northern 
Territories [Goskomsever], pressure by any regional groups, or 
"intrigues from the president's inner circle." 
  So far it is hard to judge how substantiated the first hope 
is (Goskomsever's involvement). Yet the next one has already 
been called into question by one regional group -- from 
Chechnya. The deputy prime minister believed negotiations with 
the republic would be possible only after new presidential and 
parliamentary elections there, while the president and 
parliament have no intention of quitting early, describing Mr. 
Shakhray as unobjective. The Chechen opposition, on the other 
hand, agrees with his self-assessment ("no one understands the 
question of nationality policy better than I") and believes that 
it was precisely at the moment when Russia has developed a 
clear-cut position on a settlement in Chechnya that the deputy 
prime minister has been removed by "power structures connected 
with Dzhokhar Dudayev and oil and arms." 
  The hope about the absence of "intrigues" appears totally 
insincere. Tentatively, at least three can be pointed out. Mr. 
Shakhray was one of the initiators of the political amnesty 
while Mr. Rutskoy, released by him, came out with unveiled 
threats during the recent May Day festivities. The PRES was 
created mainly thanks to the structures of Mr. Shakhray's 
ministry and this, incidentally, also makes it doubtful that Mr. 
Shakhray's long-standing associate Aleksandr Kotenkov will keep 
the post of deputy minister and even that another PRES leader, 
Aleksadr Shokhin, will retain his vice premiership. Finally, 
Shakhray's removal means a certain weakening of the positions of 
Viktor Chernomyrdin who recently not only began a rapprochement 
with the State Duma but also wrested too much power from the 
presidential structures. Therefore to deprive the cabinet head 
of contact with the territories via Shakhray is the first step 
toward curbing the prime minister's powers. There are also 
stories about the role of Yeltsin's aide Ilyushin and 
presidential chief of staff Filatov, who endorsed the 
resignation, about a future deputy prime minister's job for 
Emergency Situations Minister Sergey Shoygu, and so forth. 
  If the resignation is accepted, Mr. Shakhray will 
automatically cease to be a member of two councils: The 
Security Council and the Cadres Policy Council. But the main 
thing is that PRES, based mainly on a regional elite, is losing 
powerful support and its future is becoming murky.

<F P=106> [Kris Kholki report in the "Power" column: "The State Duma </F>
Wanted To Hear Filatov. The Chief Of Staff Was Not Allowed Into 
The President's Office"] 
  [Text] Signs are that the fate of Russian Federation 
presidential chief of staff Sergey Filatov has been sealed. In 
the next few days he will leave his post. The chances of his 
retaining the post are extremely slim. Yesterday a senior 
official in the presidential apparatus, speaking in a 
confidential conversation in the State Duma, told NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA's correspondent that an edict about Mr. Filatov's 
resignation has been signed by the president and that only the 
date and the document's registration number have not yet been 
stamped. 
  Mr. Filatov himself in an interview with INTERFAX denied 
reports about his upcoming resignation, stating that "some 
quarters stand to gain from putting about rumors about all sorts 
of resignations, dismissal, and reshuffles in the upper reaches 
of power. The aim of this permanent campaign is to impede 
reform and prevent consolidation of society." 
  Yet indirect confirmation that Mr. Filatov has fallen from 
grace came after the State Duma's plenary session Wednesday 
decided to summon Sergey Filatov. This was because at its 
previous session, on 13 May, Ruslan Orekhov, chief of the State 
Legal Directorate under the Russian Federation president, failed 
to respond to many of the State Duma deputies' questions. 
  State Duma Deputy Speaker Mikhail Mityukov phoned Filatov at 
the deputies' demand and invited him to the Duma session. 
According to Mityukov, Mr. Filatov agreed but said he wanted to 
ask the president's permission for the visit. No permission was 
obtained because Mr. Filatov, by his own admission, was not 
received by the president, which is very strange for a chief of 
staff. 
  According to information in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's 
possession, 
at the current point in Russia's state history only Yevgeniy 
Shaposhnikov, Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, Yuriy Skokov, Viktor 
Ilyushin, and Yuriy Baturin have free access to President 
Yeltsin's office.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Sergey Filatov, the Russian president's chief of 
staff, told Interfax Wednesday morning that he did not intend to 
resign. 
  He said that reports of resignations, dismissals and 
reshuffles in the top echelons were planted in order to obstruct 
the reforms and consolidation of society. 
  IF Note: Filatov was appointed to his present position late 
in January 1993 following resignation of Yuriy Petrov. Before 
that, as first deputy of Supreme Soviet chairman Ruslan 
Khasbulatov he advocated constructive cooperation with Boris 
Yeltsin and won the reputation of the sole president's supporter 
in the Supreme Soviet leadership. The differences between him 
and Khasbulatov were brought to a head in the aftermath of the 
Seventh Congress of People's Deputies in December 1992. 
  Filatov thought that the top authorities had to work for 
civil peace and economic reform. This kept him so busy that he 
could not think of rumors, even about himself. 
  Reports of his pending resignation appeared Monday [16 May], 
simultaneously with dismissal of Sergey Shakhray from the 
position of the nationalities and regional policy minister. 
Oleg Lobov, now the National Security Council secretary, was 
named as a possible replacement for Filatov. 
  Some observers thought that the rumors of Filatov's 
resignation had to do with the report of a meeting the president 
had with the prime minister at which the president called for 
improvement of the government performance and for having its 
decisions carried out. 
  The State Duma decided at its Wednesday session to hear 
Filatov's explanations of the president's letter to the Duma in 
the wake of signing the Deputy Status Act into Law. At the May 
13 session Ruslan Orekhov, head of the legal department in the 
presidential headquarters, could not answer numerous questions. 
  In his letter the president mentioned that the act was 
inconsistent with the Constitution. This was true, in 
particular, of benefits which might not be liked by the 
electors. Orekhov could not explain what benefits the president 
had in mind and who enjoyed more benefits, the president's staff 
or the deputies or those who compiled the letter for the 
president.

  [Text] Speaking to an Interfax correspondent today, Sergey 
Filatov, head of the Russian president's administration, denied 
rumors of his allegedly imminent departure from the post. It 
appears that it is in someone's interest to keep bombarding 
public opinion with all sorts of speculation about resignations, 
dismissals, and reshuffles in the top echelons of power. The 
purpose of this permanent campaign is to break the rhythm of 
reforms and to prevent society from consolidating, Filatov said. 
  Sergey Filatov, who has been at the head of the presidential 
administration since the end of January 1993, believes the top 
priority for Russia's top leadership at this stage is purposeful 
work aimed at strengthening civil peace and carrying out 
economic reforms.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Ivanova and Vladimir </F>
Solntsev] 
  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Sergey Filatov, chief of the 
Russian president's staff, said he did not rule out the 
possiblity of Boris Yeltsin running for the Russian presidency 
in the 1996 presidential polls. 
  "I believe this is even necessary", he said at a meeting on 
Wednesday with representatives of the business community and 
mass media of the Japanese district of Hokuriku. At the same 
time, Filatov noted that careless moves may result in launching 
election campaign "ahead of schedule." 
  According to the chief of staff, the number of candidates 
for 
president, of which there are now over a dozen, will probably 
shrink by the time of elections. Much will depend on the 
election law and electoral thresholds. When asked about the 
possiblity of postponing presidential polls, Filatov said this 
was "very unlikely." 
  "Whether we will begin overcoming the crisis this year or 
drag on for some more time depends on the social and political 
situation," the chief of the presidential staff stressed. He 
noted that the passage of the new constitution and creation of 
the supreme legislature made it possible to develop a calm 
social and political situation in the country. 
  Giving his assessment of Russia's current economic 
situation, 
Filatov reiterated the government's commitment to the course of 
reforms. "They are going ahead with the same line, but the 
situation calls for manoeuvres," he said. 
  The official expressed hope that constructive opposition 
forces would join the treaty on civil accord. He reported that 
the agrarian faction in parliament was ready to sign the treaty, 
but only after the federal budget was approved and certain 
concessions were made. According to his information, Russian 
Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov also agreed to sign the 
document, but did not met understanding in this issue from his 
fellow party members, who decided at their conference not to 
join the treaty. 
  Filatov said various aspects and directions of this treaty 
would be discussed and further elaborated by a conciliation 
commission and round-tables, at which representatives of 
different parties and movements will be able to consider ways 
for further advance. I believe, the chief of staff pointed out, 
that "opposition forces should sit down at this negotiating 
table and to take part in this process, otherwise they will 
simply disarm themselves before the public." 
  Filatov assessed positively the recent reshuffles within the 
Russian cabinet, noting that it was for the first time that a 
regional representative, Nikolay Travkin, was included into the 
government. 
  According to Filatov, the problems currently facing Russia 
are related to its consolidation as a democratic law-governed 
federative state. "We are only on our way to all these goals," 
he said, noting that a well-functioning law-governed state 
should have not less than 5,000 legislative acts, while their 
number in Russia does not exceed one thousand.

  [Text] The May actions of the irreconcilable opposition in 
Moscow, which ended with the Russian flag being burned and 
Rutskoy and his comrades-in-arms appealing for the overthrow of 
the present regime, have become the subject of a discussion in 
the Kremlin. On this occasion Boris Yeltsin was visited by the 
speaker of the upper chamber of parliament Vladimir Shumeyko and 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Shumeyko reported that, 
when discussing the problem of ensuring stability in society, 
there was an unanimous opinion that any actions of the 
irreconcilables, which violate laws and the Constitution, should 
be stopped. In the meantime, the Moscow procuracy was 
instructed to determine within ten days whether there are 
grounds for instituting criminal proceedings on the basis of the 
information it possesses.

<F P=106> [Feliks Babitskiy article: "Not Everyone Decides on Cadres. </F>
Is This Right?"] 
  [Text] It seems that cadre rotation is under way again in 
the upper echelons. And given that this process is managed on 
virtually equal terms in our country by both the prime minister 
and the president, it is not always easy to work out from whom 
the initiative stems and in what connection. We will try 
nevertheless. 
  The appointment of Nikolay Travkin as minister without 
portfolio came as a surprise to a great many people and caused, 
as often happens, quite a lot of gossip. Malicious tongues 
immediately christened him the "minister for the shah's affairs" 
[ministr shakhovskikh del]. The initial rumors that Nikolay 
Ilich would now officially represent Viktor Chernomyrdin on the 
Presidential Staff have been neither confirmed nor denied. Our 
source on Staraya Ploshchad merely reported evasively that the 
new cabinet minister's functions would be defined in the course 
of the next week (our conversation took place on 10 May, despite 
the fact that the appointment, according to that same source, 
occurred back on 29 April!). However, we still do not know 
today what the esteemed Mr. Travkin will be doing. He himself, 
during an impressive interview on radio Ekho Moskvy, suggested 
that in his new job he "will be engaged in the same thing as now 
-- economic reform in agriculture." 
  Certain observers have thus gotten the impression that the 
main thing for the initiator was to bring Travkin into the 
government. And consequently, they suggest, this is just the 
start of his career. He may shortly have to replace one of 
today's active participants. Let us not forget that Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha, who is responsible today not just for the reform but 
also simply for the operation of the agricultural sector, is a 
very influential figure in the government. He is virtually the 
only cabinet member capable of saying "no" to Chernomyrdin and 
Yeltsin. It is only natural that Travkin, even if he had the 
desire to do likewise, would simply be unable to do so, since if 
your "no" as well as your "yes" is to carry weight, you need not 
just to enter the cabinet formally but also to have thousands of 
informal links with the Agroprom [State Agro-Industrial 
Committee] commanders and the smart operators of the 
agri-business. 
  In short, Zaveryukha is backed by the agrarian lobby, while 
Travkin has no backing. Consequently, while the former may 
pursue (and is actively pursuing) his own policy, one which does 
not please everyone, the latter may merely pursue the policy of 
the person who appointed him. It is not difficult to guess the 
identity of the "absent party," as it were. You merely have to 
recall who in terms of Aleksandr Kharlamliyevich's duties is his 
chief. There are, as you will know, in fact two, and there is 
every reason to suppose that both might be interested in 
changing a strong vice premier for a weak one -- Zaveryukha for 
Travkin. The sowing season is, as you know, drawing to a close 
now, and Mr. Travkin's administrative functions are still 
undefined.... 
  Sergey Shakhray announced yesterday that he was resigning as 
deputy chairman of the Russian Federation government. At a 
press conference held at the Russian Foreign Ministry press 
center he read out the letter he had sent to the Russian 
president and head of government. In the document Shakhray 
asked to be relieved of his post as deputy chairman of the 
government "in view of the appointment of a new minister for the 
affairs of nationalities and regional policy without even formal 
consideration of the opinion of the vice premier in charge of 
the problem." Sergey Shakhray stated that his resignation "does 
not mean that he is going over to the opposition to the 
president and government or signify any kind of personal 
umbrage." 
  It has to be said that this is not the first attempt to 
remove Shakhray from the position where he was in perpetual 
charge of decisionmaking on his beloved nationalities question. 
The last time was a year ago, when two vice premiers in charge 
of these problems -- Shakhray and Polyanichko (known to be a 
personal friend of the premier) -- appeared in the government at 
the same time. I do not know how their ill-concealed antagonism 
would have ended up if the latter's tragic death had not 
occurred in the Caucasus mountains, to open the account of 
political assassinations in Russia. 
  Nikolay Yegorov, the new minister for the affairs of 
nationalities and regional policy and former head of the 
Krasnodar Administration, unlike his predecessor, was occupied 
with problems concerning relations among different peoples not 
"in response to the dictates of his heart" like Shakhray, but 
purely out of "official necessity," but again, unlike him, he 
enjoyed a good deal of success here and may be justly proud of 
the fact that no conflicts occurred on the territory entrusted 
to him despite all the ethnic diversity and the proximity of at 
least four trouble spots. 
  Yet another sensational piece of last week's news connected 
with cadre changes demands attention, namely the meeting between 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, during which the 
latter demanded that the premier take the election results into 
account and present ministerial portfolios to the winning party 
(meaning, of course, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia) 
rather than the losers (clearly meaning the Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord and Russia's Choice). Zhirinovskiy asked that 
the posts of minister of the economy, minister of internal 
affairs, minister for nationalities, and chairman of the State 
Committee for the Management of State Property be given to his 
supporters. 
  As always when Vladimir Volfovich is involved, the press, 
instead of (forgive my cynicism) sensibly saying nothing, broke 
into a panic, which is merely what he was after. They even 
recalled how Hitler, having won roughly the same percentage of 
the vote in the elections, was "in consolation" appointed 
chancellor and also appointed his own ministers. And soon the 
"nationally elected president" Hindenburg was safely dumped from 
major politics. Following a logical train of thought, my 
colleagues automatically posed the rhetorical question: Once he 
has his own people in government, won't Mr. Zhirinovskiy want to 
take the matter of "phased constitutional reform" into his own 
hands and dismiss, for example, the president? 
  You ask, we answer! Of course he will want to, and how. But 
if he ever does do something like that, then it will only be 
thanks to certain inveterate paid hacks who consistently create 
publicity for him and force us in effect to do the same even as 
we deny their "scoops." 
  Yes, it is true, Zhirinovskiy was received by Chernomyrdin. 
Such a privilege is available to the leader of the third-largest 
Duma faction. But careful readers of the agency reports on this 
topic would have noted that the premier said nothing in response 
to his guest's demands. Conclusions should be drawn from that.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belsky] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- The international "Reforma" 
foundation, headed by eminent economist Stanislav Shatalin, 
today came out against Russia's accession to the NATO 
"Partnership for Peace" programme. The foundation called on 
political leaders to "study carefully and thoroughly all the 
possible consequences of this action and to abstain from hasty 
decisions". 
  Corroborating their point of view, the authors of the 
released statement note, among other things, that participation 
in military blocs "perpetuates suspicion and interferes with the 
development of normal international relations". Full-blooded 
international partnership and cooperation, the document says, 
should be developed on a foundamentally different basis -- "on a 
realistic and effective policy of peace, on a new comprehension 
of the role and place of leading states in the world community". 
  "Moreover," the eminent Russian economists and politicians 
stress, "the economic consequences of Russia's accession to the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation would be burdensome for our 
country". "The reorganisation of the armaments industry will 
require huge spendings," the statement says, "because there are 
single standards and unified requirements to all the types of 
armaments in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. In fact, 
we shall have to re-equip our army with foreign weapons, drawing 
our own industry into a long and expensive process of 
reconstruction."

  [Text] Tokyo, 18 May (ITAR-TASS) -- President Islam Karimov 
of Uzbekistan, who is currently on his first visit to Japan, 
told a news conference in Tokyo today of his confidence that 
economic cooperation between Uzbekistan and Japan will develop 
rapidly in the immediate future. Responding to a question from 
ITAR-TASS, he noted that "the joint Uzbek-Japanese documents 
signed during the visit and the talks with Japanese Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata" justify such hopes. 
  Yesterday the Uzbek president and the Japanese prime 
minister 
adopted a joint declaration setting out the fundamental 
principles to which Tashkent and Tokyo intend to adhere in 
bilateral relations. In the document Uzbekistan expresses 
support for Japan's admission to the UN Security Council as a 
permanent member. The signatories to the declaration proclaim 
their intention to cooperate closely within the UN and other 
international organizations. They advocate the expansion of 
political dialogue between the two countries. 
  After the adoption of the joint declaration the foreign 
ministers of Uzbekistan and Japan signed a joint document which 
asserts that both sides regard all treaties between the former 
USSR and Japan, relating to Uzbekistan, as remaining in force. 
  During yesterday's Uzbek-Japanese talks Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata announced that Japan will grant Uzbekistan fresh 
medical aid worth $5 million. The total value of Tokyo's 
medical aid to the Republic now amounts to $15 million. 
  The chief aim of the Uzbek president's four-day visit to 
Japan, which began Monday , is to establish a basis for the 
rapid development of economic cooperation between Tashkent and 
Tokyo. Referring to the prospects for this, Islam Karimov drew 
attention to the fact that the interests of both countries would 
be served by the harnessing of Japan's technological power to 
Uzbekistan's huge natural resources. "According to estimates by 
U.S. experts, Uzbekistan's mineral and raw material reserves are 
worth $3 trillion," the president said. 
  Islam Karimov disclosed that the possibility of opening a 
direct air link between Uzbekistan and Japan was discussed 
during his talks in Tokyo. Uzbekistan is ready to open up 
direct air services to any Japanese city and to resolve the 
technical questions which this involves, the president noted.

  [Text] Tokyo, 18 May (ITAR-TASS) -- "Agreement has been 
reached with Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev on 
scrapping the proposal to set up the Eurasian Union," 
Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov, on his first visit to 
Japan, told a news conference in Tokyo today. 
  The president expressed the view that the idea to set up the 
Eurasian Union was no more than a "populist slogan". "If we are 
unable to enforce real economic integration between CIS 
countries, how can one talk about setting up the Eurasian 
Union?" he said. Islam Karimov stressed the importance of the 
creation of the CIS, noting that "without the Commonwealth, the 
breakup of the former USSR could have resulted in the start of 
civil war" in several republics. 
  Speaking about NATO's Partnership for Peace program, the 
president made it clear that Tashkent does not intend to hurry 
in deciding whether to join it. "We are now studying the 
issue," Islam Karimov said. He noted that Uzbekistan is 
consulting with Russia on the issue of joining the NATO program. 
"We have good understanding with Russia on the matter," the 
president said.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Yevgeniy Savostyanov, head of 
the Moscow department of the Federal Counterintelligence, is not 
going to insist on his resignation after President Boris Yeltsin 
had turned it down. 
  He told TASS on Thursday that he had forwarded the 
resignation to his chief Sergey Stepashin and the latter 
informed Boris Yeltsin about it. "The resignation was 
rejected", Savostyanov said. 
  He categorically denied mass media reports that his 
resignation was prompted by contradictions with Stepashin. An 
engineer by education Savostyanov came to the 
counterintelligence bodies during Perestroyka years of Mikhail 
Gorbachev in 1991. He told TASS that he had offered to resign 
because he believes that he had fulfilled his mission of 
"depoliticizing" the counterintelligence agency which used to be 
a branch of notorious KGB which, in its turn, was controlled by 
the former Soviet communist party. Savostyanov said he simply 
wanted to return to public and political activities. 
  Now he will "work with full strength, as far as it is 
necessary", Savostyanov said, adding that he believes it 
impossible to insist on his resignation after the president had 
turned it down.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- "Competitors of Russia are 
actively trying to drive us out of the world weapons market", 
First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets told a government 
meeting on Thursday and proposed to grant arms producers certain 
rights in trading weapons themselves. 
  "The state programme of arms production and export needs a 
serious revision for the benefit of producers", he stressed. 
  According to Soskovets, there is "an abyss of 
misunderstanding" between arms producers and exporters and 
suggested to grant the producers "certain rights in selling 
their products independently". 
  "It is hard to explain to directors of defence enterprises 
which are the property of the state why the problem of financing 
is so acute in the industry when only one of the enterprises has 
in its warehouse submachine guns worth 200 million dollars and 
there is a big demand for them in the world", Soskovets said 
after returning from the Republic of Chuvashia where he visited 
defence enterprises.

  [Text] Moscow has pledged to take necessary steps to stop 
the sales of Russian jewelry diamonds in the world market in 
circumvention of the 1990 agreement with the South African De 
Beers company. The promise is made in a joint communique 
following the Moscow talks between the Russian government and 
company representatives. 
  At the moment under the agreement Russia is exporting 95 
percent of its diamonds through the central marketing 
organization of De Beers. However, during the past two years 
the South African side has been criticizing Russia for the 
appearance of small quantities of unregistered Russian diamonds 
in the world market. 
  The Russian delegation to the talks was headed by the acting 
Minister of Finance Sergey Dubinin and the South African by the 
head of the De Beers central marketing organization Nicholas 
Oppenheimer. 
  The communique says both sides remain loyal to the stability 
of the international diamond market and recognize their 
responsibility for its future. 
  Participants hoped that the talks that should continue in 
the 
nearest future will lead to the restoration of a stable 
foundation for the continuation of bilateral cooperation.

signed by Aleksandr Panov, deputy to Andrey Kozyrev, appeared in 
the State Duma yesterday. The deputy minister's letter is 
devoted to the arrival of the Tibetan Dalai Lama, who is on a 
private visit to Russia. Since all more or less official 
contacts by the Tibetan exile are very disturbing for China, Mr. 
Panov recommended to State Duma deputies to take no part in any 
meetings with the leader of all Buddhists.

Changes, Suspension, and Revocation of Some Legislative 
Enactments Bearing on the Military Laws Package. In a cover

financial and economic situation, a shortage of funds and a 
budget deficit, it is impossible to preserve privileges for the 
military. It will take 90 trillion rubles [R] to implement all 
the measures envisioned earlier and therefore it is essential to 
reduce food ration compensations from R60,000 to the minimum 
monthly wage level (R14,620) and fully to abolish credits for 
housing construction programs for the military.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1625 GMT on 17 May, in its "Details" program, 
broadcasts a 10- minute report on the work of the Presidential 
Security Service by correspondent Eduard Gindileyev. 
  Gindileyev begins his report by saying: "We know nothing 
about the presidential guard. We do not know, for instance, 
that quite recently the president's personal chauffeur and one 
of his closest bodyguards were replaced. And one and a half 
months ago the deputy chief of the Kremlin guard was dismissed. 
We know nothing of this, and we are not meant to know. 
  "The SBP [Sluzhba Bezopasnosti Presidenta] is the 
abbreviation for a new Russian special service, or rather a new 
name for an old unit. It is the Presidential Security Service, 
the tip of the iceberg of the former Number Nine [Devyatka], the 
ninth directorate of the USSR KGB, later the Main Guard 
Directorate of the Russian Federation. 
  "As an independent federal body subordinate only to the 
Russian president, the SBP has been functioning since 11 
November last year. After the second putsch, Boris Yeltsin 
clearly decided to close the ranks of the Kremlin guard more 
tightly. After all, during the period of the October events, 
two special subunits of the Main Guard Directorate, Vympel and 
Alpha, did not obey the president's orders to storm the White 
House. Now Vympel has been transferred to the Interior Ministry 
and not much is left of it. The Alpha command held out with 
difficulty in the Kremlin. Relations with it are fairly cool. 
But there is also an official explanation for the 
reorganization of the former Number Nine." 
  At this point the video shows a man being interviewed, 
captioned as Andrey Oligov, Russian Federation Presidential 
Security Service. Oligov says: 
  "The creation of the new federal body called the 
Presidential 
Security Service is a logical step in the general reorganization 
of the special services of the former Soviet Union and the 
special services of the Russian Federation. You are well aware 
that the State Security Committee which existed for a long time 
and which operated within the system of the USSR now exists in 
Russia as several special services, each of which is engaged in 
specific functional duties linked either with intelligence 
operations, or counterintelligence operations, or information 
operations. In view of that, a new federal service is being 
created which will fully ensure the security of the president of 
the Russian Federation, and according to his instructions, be 
responsible for guarding top state leaders." 
  Correspondent Gindileyev then continues: "After the 
presidential decree on the reorganization of the Main Guard 
Directorate of the Russian Federation, its chief -- Commandant 
of the Kremlin (Mikhail Barsukov) -- was somehow moved out of 
the spotlight. The spotlight was taken over by (Aleksandr 
Korzhakov), chief of the president's personal guard, who was 
already strong from a political point of view. The 44-year-old 
Korzhakov is the closest man to Yeltsin in the Kremlin. He was 
already guarding the future Russian president when the latter 
was a candidate member of the CPSU Politburo. He left the ninth 
KGB directorate at the same time as Yeltsin left the party 
Central Committee. He was remembered for that, both by the KGB 
and by Yeltsin." 
  The video then shows film footage of Korzhakov working with 
Yeltsin on various occasions, following which the interview with 
Oligov continues. Oligov says: "Like any special service, the 
Presidential Security Service has its own structure. In it 
there are subunits which ensure the president's security 
directly, that is, effectively an institution of bodyguards. In 
order for that subunit to function, naturally a very powerful 
support base is needed -- this includes an analytical subunit, a 
special staff which performs not only dispatching functions but 
also simultaneously processes the information coming in. There 
is also an operational subunit, that is, the Presidential 
Security Service is empowered by the operational investigation 
law to carry out operational investigations -- to gather 
information related to terrorism, and in general to investigate 
threats which could harm the president's security." 
  In answer to a question about whether the Presidential 
Security Service is growing into a "super special service", 
Oligov replies: "The very fact of the division of the Main Guard 
Directorate into two departments -- the Main Guard Directorate 
and the Presidential Security Service -- on the contrary 
illustrates the narrower specialization of subunits doing their 
own specific jobs. So I think it is wrong to say that the 
presidential Security Service will grow and become some kind of 
monster, some kind of entirely new special service. It has 
clear tasks, and not a great number of staff." 
  Gindileyev concludes his report by noting that, according to 
unverified figures, approximately 2,000 people are now working 
under General Korzhakov. These include a number of soldiers on 
compulsory service who have served in CIS trouble spots. 
"However," Gindileyev says, "basically the SBP remains an 
elite, and the most closed secret service in Russia." 
  During the report the video shows, as well as Andrey Oligov 
being interviewed, and shots of General Korzhakov working with 
Yeltsin, feature movie pictures of a motor convoy under attack, 
the presidential box at the Bolshoy Theater being prepared for 
Yeltsin's arrival, men training with handguns, personnel on 
guard at an airport, and men performing martial arts exercises.

  [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry has worked out 
guidelines of the draft program of support for Russians living 
in neighboring states and coordinated it with other ministries, 
departments and public organizations. This was announced by 
Chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Information and Press 
Department Grigoriy Karasin at a briefing in Moscow today. 
  He said this document would contribute to the integration of 
Russians with the political, social and economic life of the 
newly independent states (the ex-Soviet republics) and their 
adaptation to local culture preserving at the same time their 
appropriate cultural particularity. 
  Karasin announced that a draft of the register of urgent 
measures for 1994 which must contribute to the settlement of 
issues concerning the situation with Russians living abroad had 
been also worked out. He stressed that the discussion had 
revealed the necessity for a special body which would solve 
problems of Russians and coordinate activities of different 
organizations in this sphere. 
  The best way will be to set up a governmental commission 
composed from representatives of the respected departments and 
the appropriate parliamentary committees. Public organizations 
working on problems of Russians would be represented in the 
expert council under the commission, Karasin suggested. He 
recommended that the commission primarily should work out a 
long-term program on support of Russians living abroad and 
ensure its implementation.

"Minister Pleased with Sector's Performance"] 
  [Text] Russian Federation Transport Minister Vitaliy 
Yefimov has held a news conference on the results of his 
ministry's work in 1993. In the minister's view, his sector did 
well last year -- the decline in sea, river, road, and air 
transportation was 28 percent against the overall slump of 35 
percent in the national economy as a whole. Mr. Yefimov thought 
it necessary to emphasize that "transport workers are not 
freeloaders" -- in 1993 transport companies received 300 billion 
rubles [R] in subsidies, but paid around R750 billion to the 
budget. In 1994, the sector is scheduled to receive another 
R1.4 trillion, only to pay R3.5 trillion to the budget. The 
minister voiced his hope that once the budget is approved, 
"funds required for the sector's functioning and development 
will be forthcoming in a more orderly fashion." 
  Mr. Yefimov pointed out that in 1993 transport workers not 
only kept traffic routes in working condition, but also took 
efforts to "lay the groundwork for future achievements." For 
instance, the ministry plans to present to the Federal Assembly 
a number of bills aimed at improving the legal framework of 
transportation. In addition, the government will receive a 
program tentatively entitled "Russian Roads." 
  Regarding problems currently facing Russian transport, Mr. 
Yefimov pointed to the overall decline in cargo and passenger 
traffic. He voiced his regret that enterprises producing 
transport facilities are in dire financial straits and cannot 
replace Russia's means of transport in the requisite amounts, 
but the ministry is trying to solve the problem by attracting 
investment from large commercial businesses.

  [Text] The Council of the State Duma has instructed the 
Duma legal department to turn to the media court of arbitration 
following a complaint by the Liberal-Democratic faction about a 
news analyst of Russian television Nikolay Svanidze. This was 
disclosed to Interfax by the deputy speaker of the Duma Mikhail 
Mityukov. 
  In a TV show on May 13 Svanidze said that according to his 
knowledge the leader of Liberal-Democrats Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
paid each member of his faction 500 U.S. dollars for supporting 
the draft of the federal budget at the first reading. 
  In an interview with Interfax Alexey Mitrofanov of the 
Liberal- Democratic faction said the council did not make a 
final decision on the suggestion of the faction to temporarily 
ban Svanidze from appearing on television. Mitrofanov said that 
faction members are going to sue Svanidze for misinformation.

<F P=106> [Oleg Rubnikovich report under the "Details" rubric: </F>
"Reshuffle in the General Prosecutor's Office"] 
  [Text] Last Saturday Boris Yeltsin issued an edict 
replacing three deputies to the Russian Federation General 
Prosecutor. Only one deputy -- Vildan Uzbekov -- retains his 
position. His resignation request was turned down, unlike those 
of Eduard Denisov, Ivan Zemlyanushin, and Vladimir Kravtsev. It 
will be recalled that all four handed in resignation requests 
after the example of former general prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik. 
  At the moment Ivan Zemlyanushin and Vladimir Kravtsev are on 
vacation and will be given jobs in prosecutor's office bodies 
upon their return, with their preferences taken into account. 
According to some information, Mr. Kravtsev was offered a 
rather high position in this same General Prosecutor's Office 
even before his vacation. Eduard Denisov has since been 
appointed deputy to the Moscow Oblast prosecutor. 
  All those resigned and newly appointed to deputy positions 
have a substantial length of service with the prosecuting 
bodies. Oleg Gaydanov joined the General Prosecutor's Office 
under Aleksey Kazannik and headed the investigation directorate. 
Valentin Panichev, who joined it under Valentin Stepankov, 
retains his position of chief military prosecutor. Mikhail 
Slavgorodskiy, who also joined the service under Stepankov and 
was dismissed under Kazannik, is back in the prosecuting 
citadel. A question to be resolved today is what are to be the 
areas of responsibility of Mr. Ilyushenko's new deputies.

  [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- Chairman of the upper chamber 
of Russia's legislature Vladimir Shumeyko told journalists here 
today that the resignation of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime 
minister "is extremely undesirable in the present situation". 
  He stressed that "Russia was lucky that Chernomyrdin became 
the head of government", and added it was doubtful that 
Chernomyrdin might tender his resignation. "My experience of 
work with the premier has shown that Chernomyrdin is a fighter," 
Shumeyko said.

<F P=106> [NEGA report: "Shakhray Quits"] </F>
  [Text] Commenting on Sergey Shakhray's dismissal, Yakutia 
President Mikhail Mikolayev stated that "whereas everything is 
clear about his quitting the ministerial position, it is not 
quite so clear about his quitting the position of deputy 
government chairman." In his words, it often happens in Russia 
that someone hands in his resignation and it is not accepted. 
  Mikhail Nikolayev also had some complaints about the concept 
of the state's nationalities policy developed under Sergey 
Shakhray's guidance and published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. 
According to Yakutia's president, he disagrees with the 
philosophy of this concept. First and foremost, Mikhail 
Nikolayev stated, the reason for his disagreeing lies in that 
the new Russian Federation Constitution defines the status of 
the republics comprising the Russian Federation as states, 
whereas Sergey Shakhray's concept reduces the level of former 
autonomous entities to the level of territorial components of 
the Russian Federation. "I cannot understand this," Yakutia's 
president stated. 
  Nor is Yakutia's president happy about the fact that the 
concept takes no account of the rights of the indigenous peoples 
to these territories' natural resources. He thinks this is 
incomprehensible because the Constitution provides for a 
different arrangement for owning the natural resources of 
components of the Russian Federation. 
  At the same time, Mikhail Nikolayev does not think Sergey 
Shakhray's departure is a tragedy. In his words, "everybody 
should calm down and work." "I am more worried about how to see 
through the shipping season in the polar seas, how to deliver 
cargoes, how to feed and clothe citizens of my republic rather 
than about the change of guard in the federal government, even 
in such a lofty position," Yakutia's president underlined. 
  Bashkortostan President Murtaza Rakhimov stated in a 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA interview that he regrets Shakhray's 
resignation if only because it was Sergey Shakhray who led the 
delegation during the talks between Moscow and Ufa on the 
signing of a bilateral Russian- Bashkirian treaty delimiting 
powers and jurisdictions. "Now I do not know who is going to 
head the Russian delegation," Bashkortostan's president 
underscored. He said it is not clear what is to become of the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord which, incidentally, 
Bashkortostan's president backed in the December elections.

  [Text] Unless the arrested Russian citizen Boris Suprunyuk 
is released in Kazakhstan before June 1, we shall work out our 
own variants for his liberation. The statement called an 
Ultimatum to President Nazarbayev was made Wednesday at the news 
conference in Moscow by Chairman of the Congress of Russian 
Communities' Executive Committee Dmitriy Rogozin. 
  He said that one of the leaders of the Russian community in 
Kazakhstan, the editor of the newspaper "GLAS", Suprunyuk, was 
arrested in Patropavlovsk on April 12 and then carried to Almaty 
where he is kept in prison. He is accused of stirring up 
inter-ethnic feuding. Rogozin, however, is sure that Suprunyuk 
was arrested for political reasons. 
  Rogozin sent a letter to Russian president Yeltsin asking 
him 
to play a personal part in the fate of the Russian citizen. 
  Asked by Interfax what is behind the statement "own variants 
for his liberation", Rogozin said that he had no right to make 
public any plans on this score. He referred to mass 
demonstrations of the Russian-speakers in Petropavlovsk in 
support of Suprunyuk and on the sentiments of the local Cossack 
community.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Makovskiy, chairman of the Council </F>
of the CIS Private Law Scientific-Consultative Center, by Andrey 
Kolesnikov; date and place not stated: "The Civil Code: The 
First Major Post-Reform Law -- It Is Geared Toward a Stable 
Market Society, Aleksandr Makovskiy, One of the Chief Architects 
of the Civil Code, Believes"] 
  [Text] In line with the president's 5 May edict, the first 
(general) part of the new Civil Code is being submitted to the 
State Duma for immediate examination. The code's main authors 
-- Yevgeniy Sukhanov, dean of the Faculty of Law at Moscow State 
University; Stanislav Khokhlov, executive director of the 
Private Law Research Center; Aleksandr Makovskiy, chairman of 
the Council of the CIS Private Law Scientific-Consultative 
Center; and Russian Federation Minister of Justice Yuriy 
Kalmykov -- have been appointed as presidential representatives 
for the duration of the examination of the draft Civil Code. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has reported on the progress of work on 
the 
code and its significance for the market economy on more than 
one occasion. Following approval of the draft Civil Code in the 
Government Presidium, a working group, taking due account of the 
observations of 34 Federation components, 38 departments, and 
various scientific organizations, completed the general part of 
the code, which is expected to enter into force as of 1 July 
1994. The second, specific part of the Civil Code will be 
completed by the end of the year. 
  The code's entry into force will open the way for the 
unification of civil legislation and strictly licit civil 
exchange on new principles -- the principles of private 
ownership and private law. Through the adoption of the general 
part of the code, the first step will be taken toward overcoming 
the monstrous contradictions between a whole series of 
specialist normative acts and laws of fundamental significance 
for the development of the market, and toward constructing a 
stable, defined, civilized system of market law. 
  At the behest of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's observer, Aleksandr 
Makovskiy evaluated the prospects for the Civil Code's passage 
through parliament and the further development of civil law in 
CIS countries. 
  [Kolesnikov] Aleksandr Lvovich, it is no secret to anyone 
that the code definitively and irrevocably establishes private 
ownership. But this circumstance is bound to prompt a negative 
reaction from the extreme left-wing and extreme right-wing 
factions in parliament.... 
  [Makovskiy] In establishing private ownership, the Civil 
Code follows on from the Constitution, although in respect of 
the latter it occupies a subordinate position. The Civil Code 
is not a reform-based law. It does not privatize anything, nor 
does it implement land reform. Private property exists already, 
and the code sets the rules for handling it. This is an act of 
post-reform legislation, and it is geared toward stable 
relations. 
  It is possible that the question will arise in the Duma as 
to 
why it is that only the first part is being adopted and not the 
whole code in its entirety. By dint of the fact that the first 
part contains the general rules, it can be applied independently 
of the second part. For instance, it contains no specialist 
rules on contracts of sale or on subcontracting, but there are 
rules concerning all contracts. And arbitration courts are now 
impatiently awaiting the adoption of the general section. 
Deadlines are of secondary importance. A market economy 
requires appropriate legal regulation, which the first part can 
guarantee to a greater or lesser extent, but the second part is 
still some way away from completion. The draft of the general 
section which is being submitted to the Duma is the fourth 
version. In respect of the more specific part, it may just be a 
matter of the first or section versions. However, work on the 
second part will be finished by the end of the year. 
  Many political movements went into the elections to some 
degree under the "banner" of the Civil Code. Obviously, all 
market-oriented factions voted in favor of it. 
  [Kolesnikov] What are the aims and tasks of the Council of 
the CIS Private Law Scientific-Consultative Center which you 
head? 
  [Makovskiy] In the course of the past century, the majority 
of autonomous and independent states have been striving for 
maximum unification of national systems of civil law, which 
often differ greatly from one another. Until recently, here on 
the expanse of the former Union, we did have unified 
legislation, albeit geared toward a planned economy. Because 
the scientific and information links have been destroyed, and 
because at times top priority is accorded to bogus national 
interests, civil legislation in CIS countries is developing in 
different directions. So far we have not felt this in full 
measure, but it is inevitable that we will feel it. So is it 
not be simpler for us to avoid this stage? Major differences in 
civil legislation may impinge upon economic relations between 
Commonwealth countries and significantly affect investment in 
CIS states. It is easier for any foreign investor to do 
business with a Commonwealth country which has legislation 
similar to its neighbors. 
  So it is that within the framework of the interparliamentary 
assembly a working group has been set up to elaborate a specimen 
draft Civil Code. And its first part will even by ready by 
fall. The specimen code is not a carbon copy of the Russian 
Civil Code. Its basis will comprise the Russian, Belorussian, 
and Kazakh codes, and possibly even versions of those of other 
countries. I know that vigorous work is under way in Ukraine, 
and the draft Kirgiz [Kyrgyz] code has already been submitted to 
the parliament of that state. 
  The specimen code is not a law but a recommendation. But we 
have the opportunity to prepare it so skillfully that people 
will undoubtedly take heed of it.

  [Text] "Having urged Russia to recognize the existence of 
"unsettled territorial issues" and to take up the responsibility 
for the damage inflicted by the USSR on the Baltic states after 
1940 and compensate for it, the participants in the recent 
Baltic Assembly embarked on the dangerous path of removing those 
events from the context of historical analysis and fitting them 
into the context of financial, material and other claims to the 
Russian Federation," Director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's 
Information and Press Department Grigoriy Karasin stated during 
the briefing on Thursday. 
  "Russia does not and will not bear the responsibility for 
Stalin's regime. Neither shall we engage in redrawing the 
borders or even discuss this problem," he said. 
  The results of the Assembly confirmed that the earlier 
expressed fears that the normalization and development of 
Russia's relations with the three Baltic states might not suit 
certain political forces in those countries, he continued. 
Individual Baltic politicians are looking for new pretexts for 
substantiating their anti-Russian policies, instead of giving a 
historical assessment to the dramatic historical events, said 
Karasin.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 19, BNS -- The Estonian, Latvian and 
Lithuanian chiefs of general staff during a two-day meeting in 
Vilnius coordinated a draft treaty on the formation of the 
Baltic peacekeeping battalion. 
  The document is subject to initialing by the Baltic states' 
premiers or even by the presidents. 
  Col. Gintaras Tamulaitis, the Lithuanian acting chief of 
staff, told BNS the meeting also discussed the joint military 
exercises planned for July. Other issues touched upon included 
the next meeting of the Baltic commanders in chief, 
establishment of an operational communications system between 
the three states, and the activity of foreign military attaches. 
  Tamulaitis said the meeting was "of great benefit" and that 
the three countries' representatives reached agreement in 
fundamental issues concerning the Baltic battalion. 
  The only point of difference was Lithuania's suggestion to 
prepare future officers of the Baltic battalion at a Lithuanian 
training center. Latvian and Estonian representatives were of 
the opinion that each country should itself train its officers. 
  The chiefs of general staff agreed to meet again at the end 
of June. 
  Estonia was represented at the Vilnius meeting by Lt. Col. 
Arvo Sirel, the acting chief of general staff, and Lt. Col. Mart 
Tiru, the general staff head of office. Latvia's representative 
was Col. Jurne Arnes, the chief of general staff.

  [Text] A conference of experts ended in the CIS 
headquarters in Minsk Wednesday. The meeting completed the 
development of the constituent documents of a new standing CIS 
body, Economic Union Commission, under the CIS Coordinating and 
Consultative Committee. 
  According to the documents, the functions of the new body 
include developing documents for setting up a mechanism for the 
creation of a single economic space and analyzing the progress 
of the economic development of the CIS states with the purpose 
of shaping up coordinated economic and social policies. 
  The Economic Union Commission is also expected to develop 
measures to support CIS interstate structures. 
  It is planned for the commission's headquarters to be 
located 
in Minsk. 
  If the CIS member-states decide to set up the commission, 
this will require an amendment in the CIS Charter which does not 
envision such a structure.

Russia, which was concluded three years ago, has still not been 
ratified by the Russian parliament. "At the present time, the 
parliamentary foreign affairs commission is searching for ways 
out of this dead end together with colleagues in the Russian 
parliament." 
  The foreign minister confirmed that his country's official 
stance regarding the 14th Russian Army, stationed in Moldova, 
has not changed. "We are for the unconditional, complete, and 
immediate withdrawal of that Army from the Republic's territory." 
  The next round of the Moldovan-Russian talks on the 
withdrawal of the 14th Army is scheduled to be held at the end 
of May or the beginning of June, ITAR-TASS was told by the 
Moldovan Foreign Ministry. 
  The membership of the Moldovan delegation has been 
significantly altered. The former delegation head, Moldavian 
Ambassador to Russia Anatoliy Tsaran, resigned his post, and so 
will probably be replaced by Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolay 
Osmokescu. 
  ITAR-TASS learned from reliable sources that government and 
other departmental representatives will also be replaced. This 
may have a significant effect on the negotiations, which have 
not witnessed any progress for the past several months, the 
sources noted. 
  The Russian delegation has tied the withdrawal of the 14th 
Army with the resolution of the Dniester armed conflict and the 
granting of special legal status to the Tiraspol-based 
rebellious region. 
  Reliable sources in the Russian delegation told ITAR-TASS 
that the previous Moldavian delegation did not have a 
particularly constructive attitude and was callous towards the 
Dniester representatives, who were present at the talks as 
observers.

  [Text] Moldovan President, Mircea Snegur, has joined the 
Agrarian Democratic Party, INTERFAX was told by sources close to 
the Republic's leadership. 
  At the parliamentary elections on 27 February, the Agrarian 
Democratic Party won a substantial victory gaining 56 out of 104 
seats in parliament. It put together the government and other 
structures of the executive power. 
  After the elections the president repeatedly said that the 
Party was capable of solving the problems facing Moldova and 
that it could be considered a party of renaissance with a 
promising future. 
  In an interview in the newspaper "Zemlya i Lyudi" (Land and 
People), Snegur made it clear that he was prepared to seek 
re-election relying on the support of the Party. 
  Political observers believe that the president entered the 
party to rely on its force in the current transitional period. 
  One of the leaders of the Agrarian Democratic Party, Vice 
Chairman of Parliament Nikolay Andronik told INTERFAX that the 
Party backs the current political course of President Snegur. 
  Prime Minister Andrey Sangeli and speaker of parliament Petr 
Luchinskiy are also connected in this way or other with the 
ruling party. The latter is not a Party member but stood for 
elections on the ticket of the Agrarian Democratic Party and 
repeatedly said that he shared the aims of the party.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Khamrayev, Gleb Cherkasov in the </F>
"Compatriots" column: "Dmitriy Rogozin Issues an Ultimatum to 
the Kazakhstan President. And Advises the CIS Countries to 
Agree on Single Citizenship"] 
  [Text] The Congress of Russian Communities [CRC] has 
presented President Nazarbayev with an ultimatum following an 
illegal arrest and detention of Boris Suprunyuk, a Russian 
Federation citizen who heads the Russian community of the 
Northern Caucasus. This was announced at a news conference 
yesterday by CRC Executive Committee Chairman Dmitriy Rogozin. 
  Reproaching the Russian authorities for inaction, Mr. 
Rogozin 
said that unless Mr. Suprunyuk is set free by 1 June and the 
Kazakhstan leadership provides a reasonable explanation about 
Mr. Suprunyuk's confinement, the CRC will reserve the right to 
use "its own options" to secure the release of the political 
prisoner. The ultimatum, by Mr. Rogozin's admission, is a 
forced step because the search for other acceptable answers has 
led him "into a deadlock" and proved futile. The CRC leader 
noted that the Semirechensk Cossacks have already tried rescuing 
Suprunyuk with their own forces and that in principle mass 
protest action is possible any moment. 
  Passing from the particular to the general, Mr. Rogozin 
described Crimea, Belorussia [Belarus] and Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] 
as former USSR regions most favorable for Russians. In all 
other regions, according to Mr. Rogozin, the Russian population 
is subjected to indirect or direct discrimination. Sharp 
criticism for inaction in protecting the compatriots who have 
found themselves abroad against their will was meted out to the 
Russian Government, its foreign policy department, and 
especially the Nationalities and Regional Policy Ministry, 
which, according to Dmitriy Rogozin, has done virtually no work 
under Sergey Shakhray. 
  On the positive side, Mr. Rogozin made several proposals on 
CRC behalf. Russian lawmakers were invited as a matter of 
urgency to adopt a law on repatriates and also draft and approve 
"10 to 15 principles," guided by which, Russia could fulfill its 
duty before the Russian people living in the CIS countries. At 
this point the Russian communities' leader asked not to confuse 
Russians with "Russian speakers" among whose number Messrs. 
Nazarbayev and Shevardnadze were included. The Russian 
Government was advised to expand contacts with Russian 
communities, in particular work toward "most favored regime" 
being granted to Russian businessmen in the CIS countries. The 
CIS heads of state were urged to adopt a joint pact on dual 
citizenship or single citizenship for all CIS countries.

  [Text] Coal miners in Karaganda (Kazakhstan) are into the 
second day of a strike called by the independent unions of 
mineworkers. As many as nine pits are affected and depending on 
the shift, 500 to 700 miners stay away from work. In an 
interview with INTERFAX on Thursday [19 May], local prosecutors 
qualified the action as legitimate. 
  Union spokeswoman Olga Krivodanova said the management of 
the 
Karagandaugol company had offered the unions to set up a 
conciliatory commission to try to settle differences. The union 
leaders are ready to enter negotiations but do not want to 
suspend the strike while the management is studying the miners' 
demands. 
  Krivodanova stressed that the administration had had enough 
time to examine the package, which it received six months ago. 
She said the strike would not be called off until an 
appropriate agreement was signed. Management officials and 
union leaders are scheduled to meet on Friday to discuss the 
dispute. 
  The spokeswoman also said that large sums of money were 
brought to the pits to clear the management's debt in back wages 
for April. "The administration is trying to defuse tension," 
Krivodanova said. 
  The company employs more than 100,000 workers, but only 
6,000 
of them belong to the independent unions.

<F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Ladin under the "Events and </F>
Commentaries" rubric: "One `Noose' Is No Longer Enough"] 
  [Text] A law and order operation codenamed "Noose" was in 
effect throughout Kazakhstan for more than a week. It was 
carried out at the initiative of the Republic's President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
  No state of emergency was imposed in Alma-Ata [Almaty] or 
the 
other cities, Kairbek Suleymanov, state councillor of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, underlined in his interview for KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA. But the rising crime had become so "burning" an issue 
that the situation called for tough measures, which proved 
sudden to some extent. The first unusual thing was that 
substantial law and order forces, including internal troops, 
were brought in to impose order in towns and populated centers. 
No Army units were deployed. 
  The job done is not small. According to the state 
councillor, 50,428 people came under scrutiny of the patrols and 
militia bodies during the week. Naturally, those are people 
only detained for offenses. 
  During the week 333 kg of narcotics were seized. The 
militia's "hauls" were sometimes between 0.5 to 1.5 kg. 
Suleymanov does not dispute that some regular routes for drugs 
coming from Tajikistan were discovered, but in 11 instances the 
"goods" were carried by citizens of that Republic. 
  Some 1,500 illegally stored weapons were seized. Militia 
seized a submachinegun and a "Mukha" hand-held grenade launcher 
from Oleg Osadchiy, a military officer, who was attempting to 
sell them. 
  The operation is over. On the whole it yielded the expected 
results while one cannot say that crime in Kazakhstan has been 
finally defeated.

surveyed do not see any prospects for their continued service, 
and 25 percent have already decided to leave the Belarusian 
Armed Forces. As many as 96 percent of the servicemen expressed 
their discontent with the legal status and material security of 
Belarusian officers (by the way, 67 percent of college officers 
do not have their own housing), and they believe that if Belarus 
continues to conduct such a military policy, our Army will end 
up without a future. 
  In the opinion of those surveyed, their situation may 
improve 
if they are granted privileges, which officers in the Belarusian 
Interior Ministry and the Russian Federation Armed Forces are 
currently enjoying, including free passes for city and suburban 
transportation, reimbursement of fares for officers' and their 
families' holiday travels within the CIS, free medical treatment 
in spas, full compensation for rent charges, possibility of 
receiving preferential loans, etc. 
  Regarding officers' attitude toward contract service, 30 
percent of those surveyed disapprove of it, 34 percent refused 
to answer, and 36 percent support it, but only provided that the 
state fulfills its responsibilities.

<F P=106> [Report attributed to BELINFORM: "Situation Will Improve in </F>
the Immediate Future"] 
  [Text] Unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and 
Russia is a mandatory condition for pulling the Republic out of 
its current crisis. Belarus will be able to preserve its 
independence only through economic union with Russia. This 
staunch position was declared by Belarusian Prime Minister 
Vyachaslaw Kebich during a visit to Borisov, where he met with 
residents and the leaders of local enterprises. 
  Speaking to an audience at the Town Center of Culture, 
Vyachaslaw Kebich assured that, despite various talks on the 
current government faults, he has a program for pulling the 
state out of the crisis. In particular, the government will 
considerably cut down its financial support to unprofitable 
enterprises. It was recommended that banks stop allotting 
credits to such entities. The "Law on Bankruptcy" will be 
applied. The government is going to launch a wide-scale 
campaign to set up share holding enterprises along with foreign 
investors. To stop the decrease in the standard of living, the 
Cabinet of Ministers specified an inventory of goods which will 
be produced in the Republic in required amounts, irrespective of 
all economic difficulties. 
  Citing the opinions of foreign experts, Vyachaslaw Kebich 
said: "If the government manages to realize its plans, 
Belarusian industry will increase its production as early as 
1995." 
  In the opinion of the head of state, similar results could 
be 
expected in the agricultural sector. The government will 
support the financial situation of the agricultural sector by 
lifting certain taxes. The Cabinet of Ministers plans to lift 
taxes on real estate, water, subsidiary production, and health 
care, as well as certain environmental taxes. The government 
declared its readiness to finance the development of the 
agrarian social sector. 
  As to the question of if the Cabinet of Ministers supports a 
collective form of economy, Vyachaslaw Kebich answered that, in 
his opinion, kolkhozes have not yet used all their reserves and 
opportunities. "Our position is not to destroy what has not 
become obsolete." 
  In his talk with Borisov residents, Vyachaslaw Kebich made 
assurances that the situation in the republican economy would 
change for the better in the immediate future. The prime 
minister links this hope with the signing of the monetary merger 
agreement with Russia. This subject was discussed at his 
meeting with leaders of "Ekran" Association enterprises, which 
are currently undergoing conversion. They produce first-class 
navigational equipment for aircraft and ships. 
  "I strongly support a new confederative union," said 
Vyachaslaw Kebich. 
  As for economic union with Russia, the prime minister 
believes that Ukraine -- after holding its presidential 
elections -- will also support this idea. The Asian republics 
[of the former USSR] would like to become members, as well. In 
the opinion of the head of government, a Russian ruble can 
become legal tender in Belarus in as little as one or two months.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Results of the Session of the </F>
Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet"] 
  [Excerpts] Myacheslaw Hryb chaired the 18 May session of 
the Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. The session 
participants discussed the issue of the implementation of a law 
on languages. Nil Hilevich, chairman of the legislative 
commission for education, culture, and preservation of historic 
heritage, delivered a report. He substantiated the setting up 
of an office within the Cabinet of Ministers to pursue a unified 
language policy in the Republic, and expediting the drafting of 
legal acts -- aimed at implementing the "Law on Languages in the 
Republic of Belarus" -- by state bodies subordinated to the 
government. At the proposal of Myacheslaw Hryb, a decision to 
set up a working commission, headed by Deputy Supreme Soviet 
Chairman Ivan Bambiza, to work out a resolution on this issue 
considering remarks and proposals by members of the presidium 
was adopted. 
  According to Vyachaslaw Kuznyatsow, first deputy Supreme 
Soviet chairman, the following resolutions were adopted: "On 
Rough Plan Regarding Draft Laws and Other Issues To Be Discussed 
by the Belarusian Supreme Soviet Deputies in 1994 and Beyond" 
and "On Schedule for Designing Draft Laws for the 15th Session 
of the 12th Belarusian Supreme Soviet." These documents charge 
the Cabinet of Ministers and other initiators with drafting and 
forwarding legislative acts for discussion by the Consultative 
Council and the Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet under 
established conditions. More than 130 legislative acts should 
be discussed (60 of them -- at the 15th Supreme Soviet session) 
and some 20 international pacts and agreements should be 
ratified by the end of 1994. 
  To honor the memory of the victims of the war and fascist 
genocide, and in connection with the 50th anniversary of 
Belarus' liberation and victory in the Great Patriotic War 
[World War II], a resolution to set up a memorial on the 
territory of the former death camp "Trastsyanets" was adopted. 
In connection with this resolution, the government should draft 
corresponding legislative acts. In addition, a range of 
ministries and departments were charged with making documents 
accessible in Belarusian and foreign (based on international 
agreements) archives on the former death camp "Trastsyanets," 
which operated in 1942-44, permitting research, publishing, and 
film production. 
  Members of the Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet 
heard a report by the Control Chamber of the Republic of Belarus 
on developments in 1993. According to Control Chamber Chairman 
Vasil Sakovich, a resolution "On Establishing a Council -- 
Within the Cabinet of Ministers -- for Coordinating Operations 
of Control Bodies Conducting Financial-Economic Control of the 
National Economy" was adopted. V. Sakovich was nominated 
chairman of this council. It was agreed that this body will 
include, in particular, a minister for administration of state 
property and privatization, a director of the Department of 
Economic Control within the Cabinet of Ministers, a chairman of 
the State Chief Inspection of Taxation, and a deputy chairman of 
the Belarusian National Bank. The issue on measures regarding 
strengthening of material and technical supply, development of 
the social sphere of the Control Chamber of Belarus, and 
incentives for its employees was also discussed. The Commission 
for Planning, Budget, and Finances, along with the established 
council, was charged with drafting proposals concerning the 
strengthening of the social sphere of all control bodies of the 
Republic, and the development of incentives for its employees. 
  The Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet adopted a 
resolution "On Issuing Credits." This resolution, in 
particular, charges the Belarusian National Bank with issuing a 
line of credit of 100 billion rubles [R] -- at the expense of 
the National Bank profits from the first quarter of 1994 -- 
under the conditions postulated by clause No. 15 of the "Law on 
the 1994 State Budget of the Republic of Belarus." Commercial 
banks were recommended to issue a credit line of R400 billion to 
the government in May-June. In addition, the National Bank was 
charged with drafting a special procedure for using economic 
norms regarding commercial banks issuing the aforementioned 
credits. When discussing this issue, it was noted that 
enterprises, organizations, and institutions of the budget 
sector require these credits for making payments to their 
employees. [passage omitted] 
  Two posts -- that of domestic policy adviser, and press 
secretary to the Supreme Soviet chairman -- were introduced to 
the Supreme Soviet secretary staff.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Stanislaw Bahdankevich Criticizes </F>
Monetary Merger Pact Between Belarus and Russia"] 
  [Text] Belarusian National Bank chairman, Stanislaw 
Bahdankevich, held a news conference at which he sharply 
criticized the monetary merger agreement between Belarus and 
Russia signed on 12 April in Moscow. "The National Bank is 
convinced that we should integrate with Russia and set up a 
joint currency union, however, on equal terms," stated Stanislaw 
Bahdankevich. Nevertheless, he believes that the signed 
agreement contains specific provisions that cannot be accepted 
by Belarus. First, this concerns the unification of their 
budgets as early as 1995, reflected in clauses No. 5, 6, and 7 
of the aforementioned agreement; second, the fact that Belarus 
will have to receive loans not through the Central Bank of 
Russia, but in the form of state loans through the Russian 
Ministry of Finances contradicts the Belarusian Constitution. 
In the opinion of Stanislaw Bahdankevich, clause No. 5, which 
stipulates the transfer of assets and liabilities from the 
National Bank of Belarus to the Central Bank of Russia, causes 
the greatest objections. It virtually means the liquidation of 
the National Bank of Belarus. This was the reason why Stanislaw 
Bahdankevich did not initial this clause when signing the 12 
April agreement in Moscow. "As a result, we have virtually no 
monetary merger agreement because, due to the lack of consent in 
regard to this clause, two most important documents, which are 
integral parts of this agreement, have not been adopted and 
signed," stated the bank official. These documents are as 
follows: "Intergovernmental Agreement on Single Mechanism of 
Managing Belarusian and Russian Budgets Upon Unification of 
Their Monetary Systems" and "Interbank Agreement on Unification 
of the Belarusian and Russian Monetary Systems and Mechanism of 
Functioning of a Single Monetary System." 
  Stanislaw Bahdankevich believes that the April 1994 
agreement 
is much more inadequate than the monetary merger agreement 
signed on 8 September 1993. The earlier agreement was an equal 
rights agreement, according to which Belarus could pursue an 
independent economic policy. Stanislaw Bahdankevich declared 
that the Belarusian side should insist on signing an agreement 
on exactly the same conditions -- the establishment of a single 
customs zone, the operation of a single legal tender (Russian 
ruble), issued by two banks according to mutual agreements, the 
denotation of limits of budget deficits, which were postulated 
by the September agreement and were not ratified by the Russian 
legislature. 
  In the opinion of Stanislaw Bahdankevich, the expectations 
that the deficit of the payment balance, stabilization of 
inflation, and fulfillment of mutual accounts between 
enterprises will be resolved are illusory. The National Bank 
chairman also criticized that part of the signed agreement which 
concerns the mutual lifting of customs duties. In his mind, the 
gain from lifting customs duties, which will be enjoyed by 
Belarus, cannot be compared with its gain, had it taken money 
from Russia for maintaining the Russian Strategic Armed Forces 
--deployed on the territory of Belarus -- and the transit of 
Russian freight, oil, and gas through Belarusian territory. 
Though Russia lifted customs duties for Belarus, it introduced 
excise taxes on Belarusian goods and additional payments for 
transport, thus leaving Belarusian traders virtually without 
profits from lifting customs duties. 
  In the opinion of Stanislaw Bahdankevich, the unification of 
Belarusian and Russian monetary systems within one to two months 
is impossible, though Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw 
Kebich talked about this recently. "I admit that I simply may 
not know something he knows if he says that this monetary merger 
could be introduced in the immediate future," he added. The 
National Bank chairman explained his prolonged silence after the 
signing of the agreement -- which is extremely unfavorable for 
Belarus -- by the fact that some clauses of the agreement, which 
contradict the Constitution, would be changed after a course of 
negotiations.
