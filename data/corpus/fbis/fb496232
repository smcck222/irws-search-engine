  [Text] An extended sitting of the collegium of Ukraine's 
Internal Affairs Ministry took place on 22 May, at which the 
situation in Crimea was examined. A statement to Crimea's 
Supreme Council, president, and internal affairs personnel, as 
well as an appeal to Ukraine's internal affairs personnel, were 
adopted. Militia Colonel Ivan Lepchenko, head of the main public 
relations center of Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry, is in 
our studio: 
  [Lepchenko] I am authorized to make public the statement by 
Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry, the heads of the main 
internal affairs directorates in Kiev and Kiev Oblast, the 
internal affairs directorates of oblasts and the town of 
Sevastopol, and internal affairs directorates in transport, to 
the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Council, president, and 
internal affairs bodies. 
  Recently, says the statement, an extremely unhealthy 
situation has emerged around the Crimean internal affairs 
bodies. The situation is continuing to deteriorate because of 
the unlawful actions by Crimea's bodies of authority. 
  Crimean President Meshkov, exceeding his authorities, is 
vigorously interfering in the activity of internal affairs 
bodies, violating the law of Ukraine on the militia. Back in 
February of this year the president, without the knowledge of 
Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry, subordinated to himself a 
quarter of the employees of the special militia speedy reaction 
subunit, Berkut, which, instead of engaging in the campaign 
against dangerous crimes, were allocated for his as well as his 
family's personal protection, although a special protection 
service exists for this. 
  On 11 April Meshkov, accompanied by armed bodyguards, 
together with retired General Kuznetsov, former commander of a 
motor rifle corps, gained possession of the official office of 
Major General Plyuta, Crimea's internal affairs minister, and 
produced a handwritten decree removing him from his post and 
declaring Kuznetsov the acting minister. 
  These decisions, taken individually and without the consent 
of the Ukrainian Internal Affairs Ministry, violate the norms of 
the Ukrainian Constitution and the law on delimitation of powers 
between state power bodies of Ukraine and the Crimea, as well as 
the Ukrainian legal acts regulating military service in 
Ukrainian interior bodies. 
  The above actions by Meshkov are in fact meant to take the 
Crimean interior bodies out of the unified system of Ukraine's 
interior bodies laid down in the Ukrainian legislation. The 
collegium and the Ukrainian internal affairs minister himself 
have addressed President Meshkov more than once with a proposal 
to revoke the illegal decrees and directives and resolve issues 
concerning militia activities jointly with the Ukrainian 
Internal Affairs Ministry on the basis of Ukrainian laws. At 
different times, the Ukrainian internal affairs minister and 
three of his deputies went to Crimea for a special meeting with 
the Crimean president, but they were not received by Meshkov, 
and all of the Ukrainian internal Affairs Ministry's proposals 
were ignored. 
  In this connection, the collegium of Ukraine's Internal 
Affairs Ministry sent similar written proposals to the newly 
elected Crimean Supreme Council on 6 May, but there was no 
reply. Today, we can observe destabilization of law and order 
in Crimea. The number of serious crimes is rising, including 
murders, robberies, burglaries, and thefts, especially in the 
streets. Often, these involve the use of firearms, including 
machine guns, by organized crime gangs who are frequently 
engaged in bloody settling of scores. 
  Notwithstanding this, Kuznetsov's actions in ensuring 
citizens' safety are unprofessional and are inappropriate to the 
crime situation in the Crimea. With the aim of not allowing the 
collapse of the unified system of Ukraine's internal affairs 
bodies, increasing the campaign against crime, and protecting 
the interests of citizens in the Crimea from criminal 
infringements, the Ukrainian president issued a decree on 18 May 
on reorganizing Crimea's internal affairs ministry into the main 
internal affairs directorate in the Crimea and subordinating it 
directly to Ukraine's internal affairs minister. 
  Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers, in implementing this decree, 
introduced the post of deputy internal affairs minister of 
Ukraine and head of Crimea's main internal affairs directorate, 
to which Militia Colonel Chernyshov was appointed. He is a 
Russian born in the Crimea who has worked in the internal 
affairs bodies for over 20 years -- 12 of those in the Crimea -- 
in operational posts and as head of the Belogorskiy internal 
affairs department. 
  Unfortunately the Crimean Supreme Council and president 
disregarded the Ukrainian president's decree, appointing that 
same retired Army General Kuznetsov to the abolished post of 
Crimean internal affairs minister. Thus a dangerous precedent 
of disregarding the laws of the Ukrainian state has been 
created, which is negatively affecting the activity of internal 
affairs bodies in the Crimea, and above all the state of law and 
order. The operational subunits, instead of preventing and 
detecting crimes, have begun to join in implementing functions 
not intrinsically theirs -- the protection of television and 
radio broadcasting facilities, which will be seized supposedly 
on an instruction from Kiev. 
  Things have reached a point where Kuznetsov, to draw 
publicity to his person, deliberately encourages media 
speculation of alleged attempts by a thousand-strong detachment 
from Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry to seize the premises 
of the reorganized Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry. 
Meanwhile, only five senior and five rank-and-file employees of 
the Ukrainian Internal Affairs Ministry are there now with the 
sole task of providing practical assistance. Despite the 
complete absence of any grounds, which was later acknowledged by 
Kuznetsov himself, the Crimean militia were put on alert and 
given machine guns. Also surprising was the fact that Kuznetsov 
ordered to bar from the premises of the interior bodies 
representatives of the higher office, the Ukrainian Internal 
Affairs Ministry. 
  An explosive situation is being provoked and mounted. 
Suspicion and mistrust for the Ukrainian authorities is being 
planted. The collegium of the Ukrainian Internal Affairs 
Ministry places all responsibility for the developments in 
Crimea and possible unforeseen consequences on Kuznetsov and the 
forces that created conditions for this. As for the actions 
taken by Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry, those were 
prompted by concern for our ability to ensure reliable 
protection of the legitimate interests of citizens and the state 
from illegal infringement, and strengthen law and order in the 
Crimea. They by no means were and never will be aimed at 
restriction of the legitimate power and authority of the Crimean 
Supreme Council and president. 
  Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry constantly is and will 
be 
providing necessary assistance to Crimean interior bodies within 
the limits of Ukrainian legislation and taking account of the 
norms of Crimean laws that do not contradict the said 
legislation. 
  We understand the difficult situation in which the Crimean 
militia personnel is lately forced to work. We are grateful to 
them for their endurance, staunchness, and ability to preserve 
calm and prevent themselves from being drawn into dangerous 
political games. We hope they will maintain a similarly balanced 
position in the future and preserve the unity of our ranks in 
the name of our main task, our battle against crime. 
  We are following the road of building a law-governed state, 
which is not an easy one. Our joint efforts allowed us to 
preserve civil peace in complex situations, prevent 
confrontation, and, moreover, bloodshed. And that is our 
unchanging stance. 
  Appealing to the Crimean Supreme Council and president, we 
are counting on them to exercise foresight, wisdom, and 
consideration in their decisions concerning issues that relate 
to the functioning of such an important armed formation as 
interior bodies. We are expressing confidence that your earlier 
decisions will be revised. This would contribute to mutual 
respect and cooperation, as well as preservation of established 
good traditions. 
  This statement was adopted at a meeting of the collegium of 
Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry, the heads of the main 
internal affairs directorates in Kiev and Kiev Oblast, the 
internal affairs directorates in oblasts and the town of 
Sevastopol, and internal affairs directorates in transport on 22 
May 1994.

  [Text] The Ukrainian National Assembly [UNA] has issued a 
statement that says, in particular: "While none of the Crimean 
separatists have been made liable for violating Ukrainian laws, 
attempting to separate the Ukrainian lands and kindling 
interethnic enmity, some Ukrainian patriots are in prison." The 
statement points to a repeated arrest of Valeriy Bobrovych, a 
leading member of the UNSO [Ukrainian National Self-Defense--the 
paramilitary wing of the UNA] territorial command in Lvov, who 
had arrived in Kiev for an operation after sustaining an injury 
in Abkhazia.

  [Text] Simferopol, 22 May -- The autonomy's Ukrainian 
parties held a meeting at the officers' house. The meeting 
established Crimea's shadow parliament, the Civic Council of 
Crimea. The parliament is elected from 66 constituencies 
according to the majoritarian system: groups of citizens who 
support Ukraine's statehood and territorial integrity nominate 
candidates from parties of the same political stand. 
  It is planned that the parliament will have 98 seats divided 
between parties. The following parties will nominate candidates 
to the parliament: the Crimean branch of the Ukrainian 
Republican Party, the Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Crimean 
branch of the People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh], the 
All-Crimean Prosvita Society, the Society of Teachers and 
Educators, the Crimean branch of the Ukrainian National 
Assembly, the Ukrainian Civic Congress of Crimea, the Vasyl Stus 
Memorial Society, and the Organization of the Crimean-Tatar 
National Movement. The newly established parliament, the 
meeting said, is not pro-Ukrainian by nature. It is a 
multiethnic parliament that supports Ukrainian statehood. 
  According to the approved program documents, the Civic 
Council of Crimea is a representative body of Crimean residents 
who regard themselves as citizens of Ukraine and do not 
recognize independent Crimean statehood. The participants of 
the meeting approved the principles according to which the 
shadow parliament is formed. The parliament aims to help the 
deputies of the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments work out 
legislation, conduct expert appraisal of Crimean laws, and their 
accordance with the Ukrainian constitution.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol, 23 May (TASS) -- The Crimean militia has 
been ordered to stay in the barracks in connection with the 
latest developments on the peninsula, particularly the Ukrainian 
national guard's preparations for action. The number of the 
national guards in Simferopol has increased by more than five 
times lately to reach 2,000 men. 
  According to the Crimean Minister of Internal Affairs 
Valeriy 
Kuznetsov, the situation in the Republic is under control and 
the law enforcement agencies are taking tough measures to 
maintain public order. 
  Kuznetsov rejected the statement of the press service of the 
Ukrainian Interior Ministry, which alleged that the former 
Interior Ministry Aleksandr Plyuta had been unlawfully dismissed 
from his post and the criminal situation in the Crimea has 
aggravated as a result. 
  Valeriy Kuznetsov stressed that Plyuta had tendered his 
resignation himself, asking not to be considered for a post in 
the new Crimean Government. The parliament met his request.

  [Text] The 29 Ukrainian Army armored personnel carriers 
that arrived in Simferopol have been distributed around various 
parts of the city, a RIA correspondent learned this morning from 
(Petr Chernyekhevich), the Crimean president's advisor on 
military affairs. He said that a group from the Ukrainian 
Internal Affairs Ministry made yet another attempt to enter the 
Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry premises. Their minister 
issued an instruction appointing them to various top posts in 
place of their Crimean counterparts. Guards at the building 
prevented this, however. Law enforcement staff report from the 
grassroots that they intend to fulfill only the instructions of 
Valeriy Kuznetsov, Crimea's internal affairs minister. 
  It also became known today that Major-General Stepanov, 
deputy commander of the Odessa District, accompanied by 50 staff 
officers, is arriving in Crimea. They will inspect the 
Ukrainian 52d Army Corps, which is garrisoned on the peninsula. 
  A delegation of the Ukrainian Supreme Council is expected to 
arrive in Crimea. 
  Petr Chernyekhevich confirmed that all vital facilities in 
Simferopol are under reinforced guard. Crimean Cossacks are 
carrying out guard duties alongside militiamen, on a voluntary 
basis.

the administration of Leonid Kravchuk told TASS that Kiev 
possesses information that during Moscow talks "Russia will 
abide by international norms and principles." He also said that 
"Kiev will not allow any changes in the status of the Crimea as 
an integral part of Ukraine." 
  Before his departure Zvyahilskiy had a meeting with 
President 
Leonid Kravchuk. No details have been disclosed, but it can be 
assumed that the meeting specified the Ukrainian position at 
Moscow talks. 
  According to some statements in the top echelons of 
Ukrainian 
authority, Kiev is not going to sidetrack from its principles of 
ensuring the territorial integrity of the country and will adopt 
corresponding measures in the framework of constitutional norms.

  [Text] At negotiations with Ukrainian legislators in Kiev 
on May 24 Crimean lawmakers will pursue exclusively 
"consultative goals," a Ukrainian parliament spokesman reported 
to INTERFAX on Monday [23 May]. 
  Simferopol believes that a solution to Crimea's economic 
problems largely depends on compliance with the Ukrainian 
President's decree "On an Open Economy Regime in Crimea." The 
spokesman noted that disregard for the decree was one of the 
economic reasons why the law on the restoration of the 
constitutional basis of Crimea as a state had been passed on 20 
May. 
  As Interfax has learned, at a meeting Sunday morning Crimean 
legislators considered what actions Ukraine was likely to take 
if no agreement were reached. It was suggested that Kiev might 
resort to an economic blockade or supply commodities to Crimea 
only at world prices. 
  In such an event, Crimean lawmakers proposed charging for 
the 
lease of land by Ukrainian armed forces and the Black Sea Fleet 
at world levels. According to their estimates, payment at world 
prices for the 50,000 hectares of land occupied by the Ukrainian 
army, and for the 52,000 hectares of land held by the Black Sea 
Fleet "will surpass expenditures for electricity and water from 
Ukraine." 
  "The Crimean delegation is going to Kiev with such an 
approach. At its evening conference, only concrete proposals 
will be made," the spokesman said.

  [Text] Kiev -- On 20 May, statements were circulated from 
the Statehood and Center groups at the beginning of the plenary 
session of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The statement from 
the Center group contains, in particular, proposals to support 
Vasyl Durdynet's candidacy for the post of first deputy chairman 
of Ukraine's Supreme Council and to "halt the diktat of the 
left-wing forces" having agreed the candidacies of deputy 
chairmen of the parliament and heads of committees. 
  A discussion emerged with regard to the name "committee" 
instead of "commission" as it was in the previous parliament and 
also with regard to leaders of groups and chairmen of committees 
becoming members of the presidium of the Supreme Council. In 
the view of Oleksandr Moroz the presence of 18-20 leaders of 
groups and the same number of chairman of committees could cause 
the presidium to become rudderless. Vyacheslav Chornovil, while 
expressing disagreement with the speaker's point of view gave 
assurances that since in the event of an emergence of disputed 
issues conciliatory commissions will nevertheless have to be 
formed each time, their role could be played namely by members 
of the presidium. 
  Deputies were given an anonymous draft constitution of 
Ukraine in accordance with which it was proposed to give the 
president only representative functions and the Cabinet of 
Ministers should be led by a prime minister. In the words of 
Oleksandr Moroz, this draft had been agreed by Leonid Kravchuk. 
"We are talking not about a constitutional conspiracy, as 
People's Deputy Bohdan Boyko considers, but about introducing 
elementary order into the executive structures," assured 
Oleksandr Moroz. 
  Commenting on this provision of the draft constitution, 
acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy told a UNIAN 
correspondent that in a "state with a population of 52 million, 
a powerful industry, a military industrial complex and an 
agricultural economy the government should be subordinate to the 
president." 
  After this, parliamentary speaker Oleksandr Moroz proposed 
that all groups gather in order to agree the issues that were 
mentioned at the beginning of this item (minus guests and 
representatives of the media).

  [Text] Ukrainian Vice Premier on Foreign Economic 
Activities Valentin Landik told INTERFAX-Ukraine that he had 
applied to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk for resignation 
today in the morning. Landik stressed that he had made this 
decision in order to conform with the law, which does not permit 
Supreme Soviet deputies to work in a government department. 
  Commenting on the results of his activities in the 
government, Landik stated that Ukraine's foreign trade balance 
had been significantly improved and its export had increased 
several times. "We must stimulate export and limit import by all 
means. We can do without Snickers. We need import for our 
industry," he said.

  [Text] Kiev -- On 19 May at the evening session of 
Ukraine's Supreme Council after Oleksandr Moroz's insistence to 
register, only 198 people's deputies agreed to do so and this 
prevented the session from opening. As Vyacheslav Chornovil, 
head of the Rukh deputies' group explained, members of the Rukh, 
Reform, Statehood, and some deputies from the Center group 
decided to refrain from registering following a joint meeting of 
group leaders under the chairmanship of Oleksandr Moroz. 
Vyacheslav Chornovil said that Petro Symonenko (from the 
Communists of Ukraine in support of social justice and democracy 
group), Serhiy Dovhan (Agrarians of Ukraine group), and a 
representative from the Center group, said that Oleksandr 
Tkachenko, one of the leaders of the Agrarian group and former 
agriculture minister, was a realistic candidate for the post of 
deputy speaker of the parliament. 
  The national democrats made a final decision to block the 
work of the session after Oleksandr Moroz said Vasyl Durdynets 
had no chances of becoming first deputy speaker and this was why 
he was supporting Oleksandr Tkachenko's candidacy. At a meeting 
of the Rukh group, held in the chamber immediately after the 
registration, the view was expressed that a tough position with 
regard to the communist majority must continue to be maintained. 
The start of a campaign to gather 112 signatures to recall 
Oleksandr Moroz, speaker of the Supreme Council, was also not 
excluded.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ukraine's Security Service Against </F>
Ukraine's State Independence?"] 
  [Text] Head of the political association "Ukraine's State 
Independence" [DSU] Roman Koval turned to head of Ukraine's 
Security Service Ye. Marchuk with an open letter. Mr. Koval 
asserts that, despite the fact that his organization has been 
registered by the Ministry of Justice, officials of Ukraine's 
Security Service are closely "watching" DSU members: They exert 
political pressure upon them, try to recruit them, and conduct 
surveillance. 
  Therefore, in R. Koval's opinion, Ukraine's Security 
Service, 
in fact, drives the organization headed by him to embark upon 
the road of illegal activity and extra-parliamentary struggle 
for Ukrainian independence. Mr. Koval calls upon General 
Marchuk to stop secret surveillance over DSU members or, 
otherwise, they will have to turn to judicial bodies and sue 
Ukraine's Security Service. However, if Ukraine's Security 
Service opts to work for Ukraine, the DSU chairman promises it 
his organization's assistance.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Saburov, deputy prime minister of </F>
the Crimean Government, by KRYMSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent I. 
Dyakov; place and date not given; under the rubric "Exclusive 
Interview": "Yevgeniy Saburov: Agreement With Russia Signed"] 
  [Text] Negotiations were held between government 
delegations of Russia and Crimea in Moscow. On returning to 
Simferopol from the Russian capital, Ye.F. Saburov, deputy prime 
minister of the Crimean Government, answered our correspondent's 
questions. 
  [Dyakov] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, what news did you bring from 
Moscow? 
  [Saburov] As a result of the just-completed negotiations, 
the 
parties signed a Russian-Crimean framework intergovernmental 
trade and economic agreement. This document defines the 
boundaries within which Russia and Crimea undertake to develop 
mutually profitable business relations. We speak here of trade 
and economic ties. We will create the most favorable conditions 
for entities engaged in economic activities. 
  Within the framework of this agreement, agencies and 
enterprises will be able to enter into economic contracts 
between themselves. This will lead to an expansion of 
Russian-Crimean trade. For us, relations with our Russian 
partners are very important. Thanks to a strengthening of these 
ties, we will be able to speed up the implementation of economic 
reforms. 
  [Dyakov] But the ties also existed in the past. Why was it 
necessary to formalize them in an agreement? 
  [Saburov] It is true that Crimea is linked with Russia by a 
myriad invisible threads. After the disintegration of the Soviet 
Union, however, economic relations became more complicated. A 
new and rather difficult situation emerged. Customs and other 
artificial barriers arose between Crimea and Russia. Simply 
talking about removing these barriers cannot solve the problem. 
Thanks to these agreements, relations with Russia have been 
elevated to a new, higher level. The two governments undertook 
an obligation to facilitate the expansion of cooperation in 
every way. 
  [Dyakov] Apparently, the framework agreement is to be 
followed by concrete steps in bringing Crimea and Russia closer 
together in the economic sense, is it not? 
  [Saburov] Some steps already have been taken to fill the 
outlined framework with concrete content. For instance, Russia 
had a limit on how much cash could be taken out of the country, 
including to Crimea. It was set at 500,000 rubles [R]. Too 
little for vacationers at current prices. Now this amount has 
been increased to R1.4 million. This is extremely important for 
Crimea. In the summer we expect millions of Russians to come and 
vacation here. They will be able to spend their pocket 
money--the R1.4 million--on our goods and services. The Crimean 
budget will get an infusion. In short, the benefit is obvious. 
  In addition, the Russian Government made the decision to 
subsidize vouchers to Crimean resorts. The corresponding 
expenses will be carried by insurance funds and trade unions. 
Thanks to this, our sanitariums, room-and-board facilities, and 
recreation homes will not be empty... 
  [Dyakov] How will the agreement affect the development of 
Crimean industry? 
  [Saburov] Most tangibly. We will define the volume of 
Crimean 
products to be shipped to Russia with reduced customs 
formalities. We have conducted negotiations on the issues of 
transportation and communications. Russian Government leaders 
treated with understanding our difficulties and requests. We 
count on the closest cooperation with our partners in the 
brotherly country. 
  [Dyakov] Who conducted the negotiations on the Russian side? 
  [Saburov] The head of government, V.S. Chernomyrdin. At the 
signing of the agreement he emphasized that nothing now stands 
in the way of concrete contracts between Russian and Crimean 
enterprises. He urged an intensification of this work, bringing 
into its orbit broad circles of interested parties. The 
agreement was signed by Russia's Deputy Prime Minister S.M. 
Shakhray and myself. 
  [Dyakov] Were these long negotiations? 
  [Saburov] They began under the previous Crimean leadership, 
but at some stage ground to a halt. Now we have been able to 
bring them to a successful conclusion. 
  [Dyakov] When may the results of the negotiations have an 
effect in overcoming the economic crisis in Crimea? 
  [Saburov] Unfortunately, not right away. The economy has a 
very strong inertia. But there will definitely be positive 
results. Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin suggested, for 
instance, that we start thinking now of Crimea's preparations 
for the winter and the fuel and energy supply. We are supposed 
to sign contracts for exports of our products to Russia, which 
should give a boost to our industrial production. 
  [Dyakov] For many Crimean enterprises, as well as Russian 
ones, the problem of mutual nonpayments is practically 
unsurmountable. Have you been able to resolve it? 
  [Saburov] We touched upon this issue in the course of 
negotiations. We resolved to clear financial channels between 
Russian and Crimean enterprises. Then mutual payments for 
products shipped will flow through them unimpeded. We will keep 
under supervision the implementation of concrete measures in 
this respect. This is what we agreed on with the Russians. In 
short, we see this agreement as a door that has opened between 
Russia and Crimea. I am confident that it will always remain 
open.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Oliynyk: "Rumors About Conversion Are </F>
Considerably Exaggerated"] 
  [Text] The production of military technology and weapons 
has decreased several times over, rather than by a civilized 
number of percent. For example, whereas, earlier, any 
defense-industry plant in Ukraine manufactured 70 or 80 percent 
of military products, it presently only manufactures about 10 
percent of them, without producing any civilian products 
instead. Is it now possible to say that conversion is in 
progress in Ukraine? Experts believe that one can now talk of a 
different thing -- the decline and collapse of the previously 
mighty and science-intensive branch of machine building and the 
military-industrial complex. 
  It does not take a prophet to point out once again that the 
problem of conversion in Ukraine is extremely important. 
Ukraine is the second most powerful representative of the 
former Union's military-industrial complex after Russia. There 
are, in Ukraine, 800 ship-, tank-, and aircraft-building plants 
that used to be constituent parts of the might of the former 
USSR. Ukraine tried to convert the military-industrial complex 
and machine building. Why tried? Because the state program is 
based upon a program-oriented principle and was elaborated for 
400 enterprises. Precisely this program envisaged the 
transition of their work to satisfy civilian needs and a 
decrease in military production. Regarding the former, that is 
to say, the cessation of the manufacture of military products, 
it has, indeed, taken place. However, not in accordance with a 
systematic program, but as a result of a spontaneous reduction 
in the production of military technology and weapons. Production 
has been reduced severalfold. 
  The reason for this is, primarily, the fact that the 
Russians 
used to be customers of Ukrainian plants, but, presently, they 
are creating their own industries. The second reason is the 
extremely low wages of workers in the machine building and 
military-industrial complexes, averaging between 600,000 and 
800,000 karbovantsi [K] a month. What actually took place there 
was not conversion, since, as a result, we have empty production 
shops, workers who have not been retrained, the unprocessed 
technological specifications, and the loss of production 
potential. 
  The state program was developed in 1991-92. If one can put 
it this way, it took place in a different state. At that time, 
Ukraine's financial situation was different, there were 
different reserves and resources, and the rate of inflation was 
not so unrestrained. If you remember, the collapse occurred at 
the beginning of 1994, and all calculations of the state program 
were eaten up by inflation. 
  Nor are Western investors in any hurry to come to Ukraine. 
Despite the fact that both Germany and the United States showed 
an interest in investing in Ukrainian conversion. Nothing went 
beyond talk and intentions, even though the Ukrainian Government 
did try to attract Western capital by its conversion projects. 
The reason is simple and banal: Money may only be given for 
private industries, whereas the entire defense industry is 
state-controlled. There is still no money and nor is there the 
sum of $40 million that was recently promised by Americans. If 
this money is granted to Ukraine in the near future, almost half 
of it will go for remunerating the labor of U.S. specialists and 
experts. By way of comparison, I will quote the following 
figure: Experts have estimated that at least tens of billions 
of U.S. dollars may be needed for the renovation and conversion 
of Ukrainian defense capacities. 
  Having appraised the situation, Western investors were, 
frankly speaking, pleased with such a state of affairs. First 
and foremost, they got rid of a powerful competitor in weapons 
production on the world market, and that is why the firms of the 
United States, France, Germany, and Sweden presently reign 
there. The West no longer fears the capacity of Ukraine's 
defense plants, which live from hand to mouth. Finally, 
Ukraine, having reduced, by tens of times, its manufacture of 
weapons and military products, has not proceeded to 
manufacturing competitive civilian products. This means that, 
in the next few years, we will not, so to speak, present any 
hazard on the world market of modern civilian products. 
  There also arises the following question: If the state is so 
poor, why doesn't the government make use of private capital for 
implementing conversion. This capital in Ukraine is not very 
mighty, but it does exist. I mean the capital of between $5 
billion and $7 billion that has been taken abroad since the 
establishment of independence and that works for the Western 
economy. The reason is that, however painful it may be to 
admit, Ukraine and its state apparatus still remain successors 
to the Ukrainian SSR. Everything proceeds by the inertia of the 
former Council of Ministers, as the people there have remained 
the same with the same mentality. 
  Even though not a single statesman will specify the 
country's 
losses due to the collapse of the military-production potential, 
in accordance with rough estimates by experts, Ukraine has 
already lost several billion U.S. dollars in pure income, not to 
mention the fact that, with a true conversion, we would have 
preserved the scientific and production base and potential worth 
tens of billions of U.S. dollars. The aircraft- and 
tank-building industries have been particularly affected, as 
well as plants and enterprises manufacturing radio equipment. 
  It goes without saying that all of this is not only due to 
foot dragging or poor economic management, but this does not 
make things easier.

  [Excerpts] Kiev -- A joint sitting was held on 19 May by 
the Council of Chernobyl Town, Kiev City and Oblast Invalids, 
and representatives of the Ukrainian Health Protection Ministry, 
Ukraine's Ministry for the Protection of the Population from the 
Aftermath of the Chernobyl AES accident [MinChernobyl], Kiev 
city and oblast health protection directorates, Kiev's 
radiational medicine centers, Ukraine's radiational medicine 
scientific center, and the capital's state administration. 
[passage omitted] 
  Talking with correspondents, Valeriy Kyrkorov, chairman of 
the Council of Chernobyl Town, Kiev City and Oblast Invalids, 
made public the following data from the Ukrainian Health 
Protection Ministry: The total number of deaths among those who 
suffered as a result of the Chernobyl catastrophe between 1988 
and 1993 is in excess of 90,000, while the number of deaths 
among the clear-up staff in the same period has already reached 
almost 4,000. The conclusion made by interdepartmental expert 
councils is that since 1993 alone a total of 805 (60 percent) 
liquidators' deaths have been linked to the effects of the 
accident.

<F P=106> [Report by Syarhey Plytkevich: "State Power Is Means of </F>
Winning Post of President"] 
  [Text] We have learned the preliminary data regarding the 
number of signatures collected in cities and rayons in support 
of the main candidates for president of Belarus. These figures 
are of particular interest, and provide reasons for pondering 
this issue. 
  Thus, Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich received 
more supporting signatures than his rivals. He was supported 
not only by 203 deputies, but also by 400,000 Belarusian voters. 
These are impressive results, however, they can be explained if 
we consider that state officers were actively participating in 
this signature campaign. We have evidence of all these facts, 
therefore, it is ridiculous to cite any of them. Our editorial 
office as well as the editorial offices of other newspapers, and 
the Civilian Election Committee have such evidence. By the way, 
when we queried Alyaksandr Abramovich, chairman of the Central 
Commission for Holding Presidential Elections, he admitted that 
state bodies participate in election battles. 
  However, a question arises: Is this good or bad? Can state 
bodies be really depoliticized and perform only the so-called 
function of social management? There are various opinions on 
this point. State bodies in states with the old democratic 
traditions are to a certain degree affected by a ruling party. 
Thus, what can be said about the states that are, in fact, 
shifting from one political system to another? The role of 
state bodies in these countries is continually increasing. The 
results of the first stage of a presidential race in Belarus 
demonstrate this very vividly. Belarusian Prime Minister 
Vyachaslaw Kebich, for whom the entire state system worked, 
collected a majority of votes. This could not be otherwise: 
Any other presidential candidate constitutes a certain threat 
to many employees of the Cabinet of Ministers, the oblast and 
rayon executive committees. 
  Earlier we wrote that only Supreme Soviet Chairman 
Myacheslaw 
Hryb could change this situation by entering the campaign. In 
this case, the officers of state bodies would have to choose 
between him and Kebich. However, Myacheslaw Ivanavich did not 
risk taking this step. So, state officers could do nothing but 
work for Kebich. Only Molodechno became an interesting and 
peculiar exception. You know that Molodechno Major Henadz 
Karpenko is also a candidate for president. Therefore, the 
Molodechno Executive Committee did not work for Kebich. The 
result is very strange: Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich has no 
supporters (zero!) there at all. This is a vivid example of the 
role of state bodies in political battles! 
  By the way, the same refers to the role of powerful party 
structures. For example, the Belarusian Popular Front [BNF], 
which has devoted supporters in many cities and rayons of 
Belarus, managed to collect over 230,000 signatures during the 
signature campaign. The Party of Communists of Belarus [PKB] 
was also characterized by good organization: They collected 
some 200,000 signatures in support of Vasil Novikaw, secretary 
of the PKB Central Committee. Other candidates, who were 
supported by small or secondary parties, or by nonstable allies, 
had more difficulties. For example, the number of signatures in 
support of Henadz Karpenko was slightly over 100,000. If he did 
not have a list with 79 deputies' signatures, he would have been 
very upset now. It is clear that many difficulties are awaiting 
the candidates. However, we should realize that only a 
candidate, who is able to win in an honest battle, could become 
a proper president of the state. His rivals will have to take 
him into consideration. However, if the presidential battle is 
manipulative, when the Central Committee for Holding 
Presidential Elections comes under someone's influence and winks 
at law violations, then elections of such a president will only 
increase antagonism in the Republic. This situation could 
trigger a social explosion.

  [Text] Tajik military subunits have been withdrawn from the 
collective peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan, Colonel General 
Valeriy Patrikeyev, commander of the collective peacekeeping 
forces in Tajikistan, said on Saturday. 
  At the same time, the commander reported that the term for 
the presence of peacekeeping forces in the republic had been 
extended until 31 December. 
  At present, the total number of CIS peacekeeping forces is 
9,000 men less than previously planned. The commander expressed 
concern that Kazakhstan had not yet allocated its own battalion 
to join the forces.

  [Text] Krasnodar May 20 TASS -- "The fact that Nikolay 
Yegorov was appointed (Russian) minister for ethnic affairs and 
regional policies, has imbued us, inhabitants of northern 
Caucasus, with hope," President Ruslan Aushev of Ingushetia told 
ITAR-TASS in an exclusive interview on Friday. He participated 
in a conference of leaders of North-Caucasean regions, which 
took place in Krasnodar. 
  "As for me, I have never concealed the fact that (the 
federal 
government) has no regional policy as yet. I have always 
criticized the ministry led by Sergey Shakhray," he added. 
  Describing his attitude toward the newly appointed minister, 
who previously led the Krasnodar territorial administration, 
President Aushev said: 
  "He is a practician, a man, who -- to use a military term -- 
commanded the territory inhabited by people of all nationalities 
represented in Russia. All of them are living in peace. I 
believe Nikolay Yegorov merits reward for this." 
  President Aushev expressed hope that Yegorov would make use 
of the experience he had gained in his economic and political 
activities. 
  "We, leaders of North-Caucasian regions, will help him shape 
regional policies," said the Ingushetian president.

Minister. On Friday the prime minister will submit the 
application to the country's president Lennart Meri, Interfax

  [Text] The Lithuanian and Belarusian defense ministers hint 
that they expect their dialogue to be held on a regular basis 
from now on. A delegation from the Belarusian Defense Ministry, 
headed by Defense Minister Pavel Kazlowski, arrived in Vilnius 
today to meet with Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius. 
  The sides agreed that the 720 km border between Lithuania 
and 
Belarus is a solid enough reason for bilateral consultations. 
Lithuania links its security with integration into NATO. 
Meanwhile, Belarus is an integral part of the CIS collective 
security system. In spite of the fact that the two countries 
belong to different security structures their defense ministers 
do not regard it as an obstacle on the road to mutual 
cooperation. 
  Speaking at today's news conference, Lithuania's defense 
minister, Linas Linkevicius, said the two countries will 
establish closer contacts if Belarus joins NATO's Partnership 
for Peace program. In respone to this the Belarusian defense 
minister, Pavel Kazlowski, said the NATO program is [words 
indistinct] Belarus. The Belarusian authorities are currently 
discussing the possible participation of their country in the 
Partnership for Peace plan. Mr. Kazlowski also expressed 
interest in Lithuania's experience in this field.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Kishkin report: "Complaints Against the </F>
Government"] 
  [Text] The latest briefing by Vyacheslav Kostikov, the 
Russian Federation president's press secretary, was held 
yesterday; it was devoted to current events. He reported in 
particular that an important conference is to be held next week 
with the government leadership in order to analyze the process 
of economic reform and identify weak points in it. The 
president had collected a number of sharp criticisms of and even 
complaints against the government, the press secretary reported. 
He he had already expressed these in a six-hour discussion with 
the prime minister a few days ago and now intended to obtain 
answers to the questions he had raised. Rumors about an imminent 
radical government reshuffle, in particular about the 
resignation of A. Chubays, were refuted. Rumors circulated by 
certain mass media about the imminent resignation of 
Presidential Administration Head S. Filatov were also resolutely 
refuted. 
  The president places a high value on the results of the 
signing of the Treaty on Social Accord, V. Kostikov said, which 
made it clear that political forces which advocate civil peace 
undoubtedly can prevail over the forces of confrontation and 
political revenge. The events of 1 and 9 May have shown that 
the forces of the hardline opposition are extremely 
insignificant. The degree of animosity and the "verbal 
extremes" to which certain leaders have resorted testify that 
they have no public support and their tactics can increasingly 
be compared with those of the Bolsheviks. Naturally this does 
not mean that the president cannot see the danger of political 
extremism. The tactics of bombing and arson always lead to 
destabilization. But the president believes that the extreme 
opposition's hopes of revenge are illusory. Russia is already 
learning to distinguish politicians from political buffoons. As 
for the moderate, constructive opposition, normal discussions 
will be conducted with it. A number of meetings with factions 
have been scheduled. 
  As far as relations with the State Duma are concerned, the 
president assesses them as favorable and is prepared for 
compromises in the spirit of accord, as he has in fact 
demonstrated by signing the Law on the Status of Deputies. At 
the same time, he cannot fail to see the trial balloons intended 
to test the president's tolerance. Some effort by the State 
Duma to interfere in matters that are the executive's 
prerogative can be observed. Here, V. Kostikov said, we need not 
cherish any illusions: The president will not tolerate any 
changes in the division of power which is enshrined in the 
Constitution. This is not a threat, V. Kostikov stressed, but a 
statement of the political experience which the president has 
gained from the events preceding October 1993. 
  Answering journalists' questions, the press secretary 
reported that when the president made the decision to relieve S. 
Shakhray of his ministerial post he was proceeding on the basis 
of the idea that he should concentrate his efforts on 
coordinating the numerous areas of political work already under 
his control as vice premier -- which is why his resignation from 
that post was not accepted. At the same time, V. Kostikov said, 
he had instructions from the president to comment on S. 
Shakhray's style of work, in particular his tendency to 
accumulate too many posts and thus reduces the benefit accruing 
in his work. Furthermore, distressing observations have been 
made that S. Shakhray's personal political calculations for the 
future will never accord with the interests of Russia's 
stabilization. 
  In answer to a question about the prospects of stabilizing 
the situation in the North Caucasus, V. Kostikov did not rule 
out the possibility of B. Yeltsin's meeting with D. Dudayev.

  [Text] Moscow May 21 TASS -- A new Russian negotiator to 
the talks with the Chechen Republic will be appointed in the 
near future, Russian Presidential Administration Chief of Staff 
Sergey Filatov said on Saturday. 
  Filatov made it clear that the removal of Vice-Prime 
Minister 
Sergey Shakhray from the post of nationalities minister is 
connected with the need to find ways to enhance relations 
between Russia and the Chechen Republic. 
  Shakhray had a firm position at the talks, insisting on 
early 
elections in the Chechen Republic and participation of the 
Chechen opposition in the talks as a pre-condition. 
  Filatov confirmed Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 
intention 
to meet with Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev in the near 
future.

  [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "YERKIR" dailies), 05/19/94 -- 
The Azeri delegation retreated to Baku from Moscow negotiations. 
Nevertheless, Russian President's Envoy Kazimirov believes, this 
negotiations were a great success since Azerbaijan has already 
declared its acceptance of the agreement in general. Azerbaijan 
didn't sign the agreement because of "several poorly developed 
and incorrect topics." 
  The experts were amazed by the unexpected harsh approach of 
Russia to this problem. The commander of peace-making forces 
Kondratyev declared that Russia is not going to organize another 
meeting for Ministers of Defense. Continuing the declaration he 
said that if Azerbaijan refuses to sign this agreement, Russia 
will stop its mediation efforts for peaceful resolution of the 
problem. 
  Azerbaijan still didn't join the agreement by yesterday late 
in the evening. Nevertheless, it's clear that Baku will have to 
accept the agreement despite "several omissions," and most 
probably, Mamedrafi Mamedov will put his signature on this 
document in Baku. 
  According to "YERKIR", the Azeri Councillor on external 
policy Vafa Gulizade declared on 17 May that "the Azeri position 
is the same, and Karabakh conflict is to be resolved within CSCE 
framework." According to "ITAR-TASS," Gulizade rejected the 
information on Azerbaijan only accepting the Russian project, 
which stipulates stationing Russian troops in the conflict zone. 
He said this information is baseless, and commented on this as 
an attempt of pressing on Azerbaijan. 
  "We are not against collaboration with Russia, but the 
Armenian-Azeri conflict became international, and can only be 
resolved within CSCE framework, which member Russia is," 
Gulizade said.

  [Text] [Announcer Igor Vykhukholev] INTERFAX has learned 
that a conference devoted to the political situation in the 
Crimea began in the Kiev office of President Leonid Kravchuk at 
about 1500 hours Moscow time [1100 GMT]. The Ukrainian 
parliament is expected to debate the same question at its 
evening session. The session will be addressed by Leonid 
Kravchuk. It is likely to be closed to the press. According to 
reports from informed sources, the Ukrainian president has 
already sent the Supreme Soviet a draft decision in which the 
Ukrainian parliament will rescind the Crimean Supreme Soviet's 
decision to restore the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992.

  [Excerpts] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk paid a 
working visit to the town of Pervomaysk, Mykolayiv Oblast. Our 
correspondent Vitaliy Naumenko reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Naumenko] Given the heavy load of 
problems 
now facing the Ukrainian people which call for the soonest 
possible resolution, the Ukrainian president received quite a 
few questions. 
  [Unidentified correspondent from Ukrayinske Radio] I would 
not like to talk about other issues on this festive day, but 
obviously, the Crimean issue is on everybody's mind today. How 
would you comment on the further course of developments? 
  [Kravchuk] Once the Crimean Supreme Soviet rescinds the law 
that it passed, the Ukrainian Supreme Council's resolution will 
also be revoked. In other words, everything depends on the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet. If it suspends its law, the 
corresponding resolution by the Ukrainian Supreme Council will 
also be suspended. I hope that the delegation named by the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet will arrive in Kiev soon, and that we 
will find some solution to the issue. But this solution can 
only have one outcome: No changes as far as [Crimea's] status or 
Ukrainian territorial integrity are concerned -- and in the 
framework of this process, as they say, is the process of 
finding mutual understanding, without changing status or 
territorial integrity. If this is accepted as the basis, we 
will find solutions. However, integrity and statehood are the 
limit, beyond which there is no turning back. No one is allowed 
to cross it. Nor will the Crimea be allowed to cross it. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you not think that the 
Crimean parliament has gone too far in its claims regarding 
Ukraine's territorial integrity? 
  [Kravchuk] I think they will end where they began. Because 
this will be a mandatory legal action by Ukraine -- and 
supported not only by Ukraine. I have information that an 
address by the Ukrainian foreign minister to world countries, 
providing an explanation of our position.... This position has 
met with comprehensive support for the territorial integrity 
and inviolability of Ukrainian borders. The whole world 
recognized Ukraine, and it also recognizes our legal position. 
Incidentally, this was confirmed by Russian Foreign Minister 
Kozyrev, who said that Russia cannot, and will not, bring up the 
issue of territorial integrity. It stands to reason that it 
cannot do so because this is recognized by the whole world. 
This was contained in the agreement between Russia and Ukraine 
in 1990 and in the trilateral agreement signed by the presidents 
of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia in Moscow. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in Russian] What is your stance 
on the presidential elections? 
  [Kravchuk, in Russian] It remains the same. While talking 
with the Mykolayiv Oblast leadership today, I convinced myself 
once again that one has to resolve today issues facing Ukraine 
and its people. Both the political and economic situation are 
complicated. Most important is that before holding elections, 
one needs to lay the legal groundwork for power, which should be 
constitutional, law-governed, and well grounded. And only then 
should elections be held -- so that there will be no situation 
of the legalities being established after the elections. By the 
way, the Crimea is a shining example proving this point. It was 
granted autonomy in 1990, and we adopted the power-sharing law 
two years later. As a result, the legal vacuum was being filled 
in the meantime, leading to the buildup of legal, political, and 
other problems. They can only be resolved when we move back to 
the starting point. We should seek to prevent a similar 
situation in this election, when you elect and then decide. It 
is always more difficult. This is why one needs to decide 
everything, dot all i's, and then conduct elections. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk hoped that the 
Ukrainian and Crimean parliamentary delegations which would meet 
on Tuesday [24 May], would find a solution to the Crimean issue. 
  However, the only possible way is not to alter the status of 
Crimea or the territorial integrity of Ukraine, Kravchuk told 
journalists on Sunday when he was present at a Cossack 
celebration in the city of Pervomaisk in the Nikolayevsk Region. 
  Kravchuk emphasized that territorial integrity was the 
borderline which must not be violated. This holds for Crimea as 
well, Kravchuk stressed. 
  He also said that the crisis could be solved as soon as the 
Crimean parliament cancels its decision to reinstate the 1992 
constitution which introduces dual citizenship and relations 
with Kiev based on agreements.

<F P=106> [From the "Baltic Business Weekly" feature] </F>
  [Text] The foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania at a meeting with their counterparts from the EU 
"troika" countries Belgium, Germany and Greece in Brussels 
agreed May 17 that association talks between the Baltics and the 
EU will start already this year. 
  The talks are to start after the signing of free trade 
treaties between the EU and the Baltic countries, Estonia's 
Ambassador to the European Union Clyde Kull said. 
  Kull said the EU officials had been content with the current 
situation of the free trade talks. 
  The free-trade talks between Estonia and the European Union 
are making progress, Mari-Ann Rikken, a Foreign Ministry 
spokeswoman, told BNS. 
  Foreign Ministry Deputy Chancellor Priit Kolbre, after his 
return from another round of textile talks in Brussels, 
characterized the meeting as a substantial piece of business 
"where the ice was broken," Rikken said. 
  "Serious attention was paid to Estonia's position in issues 
concerning textiles, and the meeting passed in a constructive 
spirit," she told BNS. 
  Officials from the European Commission foreign relations and 
industry directorate visited Tallinn earlier this month. They 
negotiated a textiles protocol to be annexed to the Estonian-EU 
free-trade treaty and toured Estonia's major textile and 
clothing manufacturers. The leader of the EC delegation, David 
Dailey, noted that Estonian sewn products are of a better 
quality than those produced in other East European countries. 
  Rikken said the third official round of free-trade talks 
will 
probably be held at the beginning of July in Brussels. "Despite 
the postponement of the round, we're not behind schedule and 
nothing prevents the Estonian-EU free-trade agreement from being 
initialed in the summer and stepping into force on January 1, 
1995," the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman claimed. 
  Latvia wants the European Union to grant its textile goods 
and fish products easier trade terms in view of the 
inconsiderable mutual trade turnover, Latvian Acting Foreign 
Minister Egils Levits told reporters commenting on the current 
free trade talks. 
  Possibilities to start talks on Lithuania's associate 
membership in the European Union may appear in late June at the 
best, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys said. 
  The EU will start to consider possibilities of granting 
associate status to the Baltics only when free trade talks are 
completed, Gylys told a news conference. In his words, 
Lithuania's free trade talks with the EU are "constructive, but 
not easy." If no hindrances appear, the free trade agreement may 
be ready after another two rounds of talks in May, the minister 
said.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, May 24 (TASS) -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the 
situation in the Crimea: 
  "One can speak about President Leonid Kravchuk's desire to 
strain the situation to the limit in order to secure 
cancellation of a presidential election. But if the limit is 
exceeded, Kravchuk would lose one of his main trump cards -- the 
image of a person who has been able to keep Ukraine peaceful 
following the proclamation of independence. 
  "In the event of such a conflict, Russia and Ukraine would 
risk losing the image of normal members of the internatioal 
community. However, neither can one fail to recognise that a war 
of nerves, during which one can manage to solve certain private 
internal political tasks and show adherence to principles 
without much expenditure of efforts or means, is utterly 
beneficial to all the sides." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) carries an article on the 
political situation in the Crimea under the headline "It Is 
Clear in the Crimea so Far, Although the Weather-Gauge Pointer 
Approaches the `Storm' Mark." 
  Covering the latest developments there, the newspaper draws 
the following conclusion: "All things considered, it is clear so 
far that Kiev has not abandoned attempts to put strongarm 
pressure on the 'mutinous' peninsula". 
  The newspaper believes that an escalation of tension is of 
benefit to Ukraine. On the one hand, in the event of a 
successful undoing of the `Crimean knot' (a peaceful way is 
meant), this would influence Kravchuk's rating at the 
forthcoming presidential elections of June 26. On the other 
hand, an aggravation of the situation may lead to cancellation 
of the elections, which would also suit the president and his 
entourage". 
  PRAVDA on the situation in the Crimea: 
  "The Crimea is becoming an explosive region nowadays. Only a 
return, even if a staggered one, to a single common fatherland 
will save the Crimea, Ukraine, Russia, and the entire 
Commonwealth of Independent States from confrontations which are 
fraught with bloodshed". 
  ROSSIISKIYE VESTI publishes remarks made by Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin at a meeting with the directors of 
industrial, building and transport enterprises and organisations 
on May 20. 
  Explaining the contents of a package of draft normative 
documents to resolve economic reform problems, Chernomyrdin said 
in particular: "With a view to attracting foreign investments, 
the government intends to exempt enterprises with a considerable 
amounts of foreign investments from paying a profit tax to the 
federal budget for three years. In subsequent two years, the 
profit tax is to be exacted at a lowered rate". 
  "Provision is made for a considerable reduction in the 
export 
customs tariffs on staple Russian export commodities, such as 
oil and oil products, gas, electric power, aluminium, and pulp, 
and for the abolition of fixed quotas for and licensing of those 
commodities' export," Chernomyrdin said. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA frontpages a report on the repatriation 
of two former Soviet servicemen taken prisoner in Afghanistan. 
  "About 290 Soviet servicemen are now listed as missing in 
the 
war in Afghanistan. Approximately 20 captives are held by 
Afghan rebel groups. Seventeen captives returned home following 
the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in February 
1989. Prior to the Soviet withdrawal, 111 POWs had been 
released, with 53 freed through intelligence channels, and the 
rest through diplomatic ones". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA publishes a column of comments by 
influential Russian politicians on the arrival of prominent 
writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in Russia. 
  RABOCHAYA TIRIBUNA runs an article written on the strength 
of 
remarks from academician Andrey Sakharov's speeches, reports and 
articles. 
  TRUD draws readers' attention to the political life of 
parties and movements that are in opposition to the government. 
The writer of an article, headlined "A Springtime 
Exacerbation", analyses Aleksandr Rutskoy's chances to head a 
mass, organised party.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Premier Vyacheslav Kebich by Igor </F>
Osinskiy; place and date not given: "Opposition's Demarche and 
Premier's Position"] 
  [Text] He betrayed national interests, "surrendered" the 
state's independence to another country, and should be punished 
in accordance with Article 61 of the Criminal Code as a traitor 
to the motherland. That was the judgment passed on Vyacheslav 
Kebich in absentia by the participants in a recent press 
conference given by leaders of the Belorussian [Belarusian] 
People's Front. A letter has been sent to the parliament and 
the general prosecutor demanding that judicial proceedings be 
instituted against the head of government. 
  This hasty move, which is patently aimed at an excitable 
audience, only causes a wry smile. 
  The opposition is jumpy.... 
  It has been so convenient for many months now to accuse the 
prime minister of deluding the people with the impracticable 
idea of creating a unified ruble zone and gradually reverting to 
a normal life worthy of man! Let us be frank. Kebich sometimes 
left himself open. His frequent overly optimistic statements 
that there was just one step to go to monetary union failed to 
materialize with suspicious regularity, thus alienating 
long-standing allies. In a desire to score as many propaganda 
points as possible from this, Stanislav Shushkevich did not wait 
for the official announcement of the election campaign but 
rushed to tour cities and villages saying how bad the parliament 
and government are. It is of course no secret to the retired 
speaker that this does not square with universally recognized 
norms. But the following has long since been well-known: Where 
there's a will there's a way. Another month or two is all that 
is needed! 
  But.... 
  Readers saw that Premiers Chernomyrdin and Kebich ratified a 
treaty in Moscow with their signatures, giving the two 
countries' economies equal rights, removing customs barriers, 
and fixing unified prices of energy sources. Without the 
slightest chance of competing with Western output, Belorussian 
goods are once again turning up on the immense Russian market 
where there was always demand for them. Thus, enterprises that 
had shut down are beginning to work again. And the timid "hare" 
[the Belarusian currency] is giving way in people's wallets to 
the full-blooded ruble. 
  One may argue about whether Vyacheslav Kebich was involved 
in 
the breakup of the USSR, which was formalized, to our shame, in 
Viskuli, and how personally accountable he is for the agony of 
the Belorussian economy. These questions will probably be given 
exhaustive answers at some point. Today, there is no time for 
moralizing. It is important to understand something else: What 
direction should be taken now -- toward the East as the 
government is insistently urging or toward the West, where the 
opposition is painting alluring mirages? 
  [Osinskiy] Vyacheslav Frantsevich, you are perhaps starting 
the presidential race in the most disadvantageous position. 
None of your rivals bears the burden of responsibility for the 
current state of the economy. At least that is what they 
themselves think. Even Stanislav Shushkevich is rushing to 
disavow what he has done in parliament. But you cannot get away 
from critical fire. Your rivals will pin "all manner of 
charges" on you. So here is a roundabout question for you: 
What is the reason for our collapse? 
  [Kebich] Gorbachev's perestroyka, beyond any shadow of a 
doubt. Having begun this without a well-founded concept, 
instead of replacing the rotten roof and ceilings and recasting 
the internal layout of our all-union home, the leaders of the 
CPSU set about shattering walls that had been built over 
centuries. 
  Had Gorbachev agreed at Novo-Ogarevo to turn the country 
into 
a confederation, I have no doubt that even the Baltic countries 
would have accepted this plan. However, the vain general 
secretary was convinced that he knew the situation better than 
anyone. The result was that, when the leaders of the three 
republics met in the Belovezhskaya Forest, the edifice of the 
USSR was already breaking up. 
  However, even at that critical moment it still could have 
and 
should have been saved. That was the aim of the document that 
the prime ministers signed. It enshrined a common economic 
area, a unified ruble zone, and transparency of borders. I am 
not ashamed of my signature on this treaty. 
  But in practice it proved a totally meaningless appendix to 
the document initialed by the heads of state. Political 
ambition and a desire to escape from the "union center's 
clutches" gained the upper hand. They gave rise to terrible 
centrifugal forces and brought about political, economic, 
social, and moral catastrophe. 
  [Osinskiy] Do you think that not everything was all that bad 
with the USSR's economic system? Have I understood you right? 
  [Kebich] Absolutely. In an attempt to justify their 
actions, "democrat" politicians are effectively committing 
blatant forgery. Ask any of them: Where does salvation lie? 
And you get the response: in the market. And everyone pictures 
a huge Komarovskiy bazaar [allusion unknown] across the whole 
country where total anarchy reigns. Gentlemen, no capitalist 
countries have a market like that! It only exists in your 
fevered imagination. 
  While I was chairman of the Republic's State Planning 
Committee I made frequent visits to the United States. And you 
know, the first person to whom I was introduced in each state 
was the governor's first deputy for planning. State regulation 
is an indispensable condition for a normal market. 
  [Osinskiy] During my work in the FRG I also encountered this 
at every turn. Small German firms, for instance, curse the 
government like nothing on earth for not being given quotas to 
import cheap vodka and consumer goods from the CIS countries. 
Agricultural regulation is even tougher. East German peasants 
were forced to leave half their land fallow so as to prevent 
overproduction of grain. Admittedly, the state's diktat is not 
administrative but economic here. 
  [Kebich] That is the whole crux of the matter, the main 
distinction from the preposterous capitalism that is being 
cultivated in our country. Something similar happened in the 
West during the "Great Depression." Leading capitalist 
countries extricated themselves from economic crisis not despite 
but with the help of reasonable planning and regulation. Take 
for example the states of Southeast Asia which are a household 
name today. Why did Japan, South Korea, and Singapore reach the 
heights of economic prosperity so rapidly? Because everything 
was laid down there, planned down to the finest detail. 
  For two years we too succeeded in preventing the wholesale 
breakup of the economy thanks to the tremendous safety margin 
built in during Soviet times. The republic had a very strong 
and disciplined industry and highly developed agriculture. 
Remember: In 1989 national income rose around 8 percent and we 
did not drop below the figure of 6 percent even during the worst 
years. Belorussia almost reached the U.S. level in terms of per 
capita meat production and outstripped it by a factor of 2.5 in 
terms of milk production. The government tried to restructure 
the economic mechanism without putting it out of action as 
happened in Russia and other USSR republics. Joe Public had the 
impression (and the opposition did its utmost to foster it) that 
reforms were being deliberately delayed. In fact, we prepared 
them carefully, avoiding ill-conceived actions, and thanks to 
this we have kept ourselves afloat for the time being. 
  [Osinskiy] The opposition claims that the main secret of the 
relative stability of the time was the low price of energy 
sources. 
  [Kebich] That is not true. They were higher then than in 
Russia and the difference became even more tangible from month 
to month, but we nonetheless held our ground and the Russian 
economy collapsed. To be honest I am surprised at how we 
succeeded in surviving! Since even Ukraine, with its wealth of 
natural resources and favorable climate, ended up on its knees 
right away.... No, it was this safety margin that saved us. 
That has now disappeared. And people have become fully aware 
of rampant savage market forces. 
  [Osinskiy] I think that the "democrats" would disagree 
with you there. They think that the situation in Russia is 
improving because Gaydar and his team jumped into the cold water 
of the market without fear and doubt. Needless to say, they 
swallowed a lot of water, but then they started swimming! We 
are all standing on the bank testing the water. 
  [Kebich] They may have started swimming -- but to where? 
Back to the bank that they left so easily. Chernomyrdin's 
government is making increasingly vigorous use of plan levers 
and is channeling state investment into those sectors on which 
the future of the whole economy depends. If you want to know, 
it is not Belorussia that needs to overtake Russia but Russia 
that needs to restore what we have managed to preserve. 
  [Osinskiy] The opposition looks as though it is right about 
some things: Have Kebich and his government deliberately held 
up market reforms. 
  [Kebich] Yes. Just add the prefix "pseudo" to the word 
"reforms" -- "pseudoreforms." I do not consider "reforms" that 
are designed to destroy the economy and which advocate shock 
therapy, and hence the mass impoverishment of the population, to 
be genuine and I will never support them. 
  [Osinskiy] Vyacheslav Frantsevich, a very complex election 
marathon lies ahead. With what platform are you beginning it? 
  [Kebich] I will present my election program later. But I 
can tell you now that it is based on the position of centrism as 
a basis for popular accord. I think that the future president 
should use ideas, plans based on their good sense regardless of 
which party proposed them, and support ideas and plans that come 
from "left" or "right." During the election campaign let us 
seek a more acceptable economic model for our country without 
slighting one another and without digging up the dirt. And may 
victory go to the person whose arguments the voters consider the 
most cogent.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Starikevich: "Belorussian [Belarusian] </F>
Government Takes Out Loan for Elections"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- According to the laws of physics, a body 
in free fall gathers speed. Approximately the same thing is 
happening to the Belorussian [Belarusian] economy -- it seems as 
though the Vyachaslaw Kebich government sees its sole task as 
being to make sure that the landing (which will be anything but 
soft) does not happen before the presidential elections. 
  All the emergency braking systems available to the Council 
of 
Ministers have been brought into play. At a routine session of 
the Supreme Soviet Presidium 18 July [as published] a decree was 
passed under pressure from ranking government officials on the 
allocation of loans to the Council of Ministers. The National 
Bank of Belorussia [Belarus] is obliged to grant the government 
50 billion rubles [R] in both May and June out of the revenue 
received in the first quarter. It is interesting that this 
revenue came to just R36.6 billion. So there is nowhere for the 
money to come from, except from the printing presses. But even 
that is not all. Commercial banks have been instructed (!) to 
allocate the Council of Ministers loans totaling R400 billion in 
May-June. Hardly anyone is likely to be taken in by the bashful 
formula "allocate" -- the mechanism of voluntary coercion was 
elaborated back in the years of developed socialism and still 
functions well to this day. 
  Stanislaw Bahdankevich, chairman of the National Bank, 
announced at a press conference that the money supply in the 
Republic had increased 28-fold since January last year. It is 
not hard to guess that the Belorussian Government's next 
economic crisis will lead to a fall in the Belorussian ruble's 
exchange rate. Why is the government taking this action and 
where will the money go? 
  The widely publicized agreement on monetary system 
unification is still not having any results. And nor could it 
-- that has long been clear to economists. But, as Stanislaw 
Bahdankevich noted, "not all of us in the government are 
familiar with economics." On the eve of the elections, the 
prime minister's team, which has staked a great deal on 
unification, would like to have at least some positive effect to 
show the voters. The removal of customs duties as of 1 May has 
not led to any reduction in prices. 
  The hundreds of billions -- some freshly printed, others 
virtually confiscated from commercial banks -- will be used to 
pay workers at budget-funded institutions. Under no 
circumstances does the government want to leave voters without 
any money on the eve of the elections. And although this golden 
rain may be expensive, it will make it possible for the prime 
minister to become president.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stepan Yanchuk, Republic of Belarus minister </F>
of finances, by Yekaterina Vysotskaya; place and date not given: 
"What Is Left `Out of the Picture' of Unification"] 
  [Text] Details that were not put down on paper, but which 
stem from the agreement signed in Moscow on the unification of 
the monetary systems were the subject of this interview with 
Stepan Yanchuk, Republic of Belarus [Belorussia] minister of 
finances. 
  The minister noted a number of elements which have not yet 
been mentioned aloud. He announced that despite the declared 
procedure for the exchange of Belorussian money for Russian, the 
reassessment of enterprises' fixed capital will not proceed 
evenly. 
  [Yanchuk] Fixed capital, and that means primarily equipment, 
was bought five years ago at some enterprises and 50 years ago 
at others, Stepan Yanchuk said. So a corrective coefficient 
will be applied. 
  One more detail is that the Republic must seek on its own 
sources for eliminating the discrepancy between the cost of the 
Russian ruble and the Belorussian ruble when exchanging money in 
savings banks. Therefore, the government will have to make a 
big effort not to ruin the banks. And not only the savings bank 
but also the commercial banks. In addition when money is 
exchanged by individuals in sums in excess of 200,000 it is not 
simply the general exchange rate which will be used, calculated 
on the basis of differences in the cost of consumer goods 
baskets, but a rectified exchange rate. This is connected with 
the fact that a speculative dollar exchange rate is in operation 
in Russia and Belarus today. So when establishing the exchange 
rate for Belorussian "hares" against Russian rubles an 
adjustment for the speculative element will be made. 
  Stepan Yanchuk specified the needs for which, according to 
the treaty, Russia will give Belarus 200 billion rubles: 
  Today, we have a negative balance of payments with Russia. 
The debts for gas and oil total over 600 billion Russian 
rubles. So far, the Russian Federation is supplying us with gas 
and in part with oil on credit. And to ensure that the Republic 
can settle its debts we have been earmarked this money for the 
first half of the year. We will reach a new agreement on credit 
for the second half of the year. 
  [Vysotskaya] Stepan Petrovich, it is known that the keenest 
disputes when signing the documents were generated by the fifth 
point of the treaty, which states that emission is effected 
exclusively by the Central Bank of Russia. Should we be afraid 
that the functions of the Republic's National Bank will be 
assumed by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation? 
  [Yanchuk] Even if the fifth point remains in the form which 
it has now, but the policy of the Russian Government and the 
Central Bank of Russia with regard to Belarus does not change, 
then there is no great fear. 
  We would simply like to protect ourselves against the 
unexpected so we are making attempts to somewhat amend the way 
it is formulated. 
  [Vysotskaya] The opponents of unification assert that 
Belarus, like Russia, will suffer from a constant shortage of 
cash and delays in payments. How real are these fears? 
  [Yanchuk] I must say that in Russia there are no longer any 
cash problems. That wages are not always paid is another 
matter, since the enterprises lack funds. Under the treaty the 
Russian side undertook to supply Belarus with cash. As for the 
question of whether Belorussian enterprises will have the money 
to pay wages, just as today not everyone has money so in the 
future some people may not have it. The main thing is to give a 
push to production, after all it is production that creates 
money. 
  Incidentally, over the first quarter of this year production 
decline in Belarus was 36 percent. Because of this the budget 
shortfall was 1.5 trillion rubles. Enterprises are standing 
idle. The reason is the price factor, because of which our 
output is not competitive even on the Russian market, not to 
mention the world market. A unification which equalizes prices 
will make it possible to boost our production and economy.

<F P=106> [Interview with People's Deputy Dmitriy Petrovich Bulakhov </F>
by Vladimir Samoylov; place and date not given: "Any Law Is 
Ineffective If Powers Do Not Want To Implement It"] 
  [Text] [Samoylov] Dmitriy Petrovich, you are a member of 
the Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet which adopted a 
resolution "On Issuing Loans." When I read it, I recalled the 
old days -- we call it the time of the command system. 
Currently, we say we have nothing to do with it. Anyway, this 
document is strange.... 
  [Bulakhov] I am angry that everything is being done in a 
hurry. Such an important issue -- issuing big loans to the 
government -- demands more than a five minute or even a full day 
discussion. A draft resolution was submitted to the members of 
the Supreme Soviet Presidium five minutes before the beginning 
of the discussion. Furthermore, this draft resolution gave 
neither the reasons, the arguments, or assessments of the 
consequences of this proposal. 
  [Samoylov] Even the budget of a family undergoes a longer 
and 
more precise discussion! 
  [Bulakhov] There should have been a financial-economic 
grounding, consultations should have been held in various 
legislative commissions, and so on. They did nothing of the 
kind. This is a gross violation of a range of legislative acts. 
  [Samoylov] What legislative acts do you mean? 
  [Bulakhov] I am speaking about the laws "On the National 
Bank," "On Banks and Banking System," and "On the Budget." The 
most essential is that the Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet is not authorized to resolve such issues. 
  [Samoylov] In my opinion, the precedent was established when 
the Supreme Soviet Presidium adopted a decision to issue 
trillions of rubles to the agricultural sector for conducting a 
spring campaign. 
  [Bulakhov] I said then that we cannot resolve the issue by 
violating the Constitution. Why did we adopt the Constitution 
then? 
  [Samoylov] All of us remember how deputies congratulated 
each 
other when the Constitution was adopted. Currently, they 
propose either introducing an addenda to the Constitution or 
simply ignoring it. However, these are formal violations. What 
can you say about this? 
  [Bulakhov] This is no secret. We lack money to pay wages to 
the budget sector employees -- teachers, physicians, servicemen, 
etc. Where can we take the money? As it is common with us, the 
decision is very simple: To take the Belarusian National Bank's 
profits and the working capital of the commercial banks. 
However, nobody ever says under what conditions. 
  [Samoylov] They will probably conduct negotiations, as they 
put it, privately. 
  [Bulakhov] If the Cabinet of Ministers begins conducting 
negotiations and refers to the Supreme Soviet's decision, this 
will mean extortion at the state level. Why are they doing 
this? They say they proceed from economic expediency. However, 
there is no such economic expediency. The problem arose due to 
our government's "activities." 
  [Samoylov] What do you mean? 
  [Bulakhov] It promised to freeze prices and rents and to 
raise wages on the eve of the election campaign. These promises 
should be covered by money. However, you patch one hole but a 
new one appears. The result of all this is that we cannot pay 
workers of the budget sector. 
  However, the tragedy is that in one or one and a half months 
from now, this will come back to us as increased inflation. 
Prices will climb more quickly, the inflation rate will become 
uncontrolled. Already in July we will have to pay for this 
resolution. 
  [Samoylov] That is, after the presidential elections. 
  [Bulakhov] In June, we will cautiously cover this hole. 
  The danger is also in that we take the working capital from 
commercial banks that, in fact, work for the economy. Actually, 
we take this money from enterprises which could invest this 
money. This is how we could finally ruin our industry. 
  [Samoylov] Are our laws so ineffective that it is possible 
to 
ignore them? 
  [Bulakhov] Any law is ineffective if the power does not want 
to implement it. 
  [Samoylov] What will you do? Will you leave the people 
without money? 
  [Bulakhov] This is the first time (however, not the last 
one) 
that we have had a nonpayment crisis. This disease is well 
known in Russia where the workers of the budget sector sometimes 
do not receive money for three to four months. This is the 
result of our economic helplessness. We should formulate a 
strategy of a credit and money policy which, to my regret, we 
now lack. 
  This should be honestly explained to the people. However, 
this is unrewarding. The presidential elections are just around 
the corner. However, after elections, everything could go to 
hell! Therefore, this expediency was dictated by political 
reasons. The government, which had bet on Kebich, wants to save 
up additional points before the elections. The poor people will 
pay this bill.

<F P=106> [Report by Andrey Shavanda: "Do Not Worry: You Can </F>
Squander Your Vouchers on Drinking"] 
  [Excerpt] A proverb says that wise people learn by others' 
mistakes. The Belarusian Government considers itself to be 
wise. We, they say, will observe our neighbors, estimate costs 
and present the most rational program [for carrying out 
privatization] to the Belarusian people. 
  However, many people have already realized that these words 
are for those wretched people who continue to trust the 
government. As do the sane people, they prefer analyzing a 
performance. The official performance is as follows. 
  Official privatization began much later than unofficial 
privatization. The unofficial privatization has been in 
progress for over three years. For example, according to an 
important official from the Ministry of Trade, all more or less 
profitable enterprises dealing with public catering in Minsk 
were already privatized in 1991-92. The same concerns 
profitable enterprises in other sectors. The mechanism of 
privatization is very simple: A joint stock enterprise is 
organized, or an enterprise is leased by a working collective, 
or a people's enterprise is established -- there are a lot of 
versions. The absolute majority of stock is taken by the 
initiators and their entourage. At a specified time, a group of 
people declares that they have a controlling interest in an 
enterprise. So, you understand what happens next. 
  Belarusian citizens can obtain vouchers beginning 1 April. 
This means that various investment funds should have already 
begun their operations, saying nothing about the implementation 
of the legislative and executive mechanisms. As of today (early 
May), 24 investment funds filed applications to receive licenses 
for conducting operations with vouchers. However, none of them 
has yet received a license. The Committee for Administration of 
State Property has even not drafted a regulation regarding 
licensing -- and you know why. 
  We also lack a mechanism for changing vouchers for stock. In 
addition, an investment fund can buy only 10 percent of an 
enterprise's stock. This is foreseen by the "Law on 
Demonopolization and Privatization." There is no opportunity to 
buy the entire stock of an enterprise. 
  Thus, The Committee for Administration of State Property has 
found itself in a rather unusual situation. On the one hand, it 
should fulfill promises given by Comrade Kebich regarding "fair 
privatization." On the other hand, privatization has already 
been carried out, the property has been divided, and there are 
new owners. The chairman of the Control Chamber has already 
spoken on this subject: He claimed that people can only hope 
for leftovers from their masters' tables; nothing more is left. 
  Generally speaking, people are well aware of this: As of 15 
April, only 2,123 certificates [sertyfikaty] (something like a 
savings-bank book where the number of a person's vouchers is 
registered) were issued. The cost of a voucher -- 25,000 rubles 
-- does not change. At the same time, the Cabinet of Ministers 
banned the auctioning of vouchers to protect them from complete 
"devaluation." If an auction is conducted, people would see 
that a voucher has a very low market price. 
  It is planned that the trade in vouchers will begin as early 
as 1 July -- already after the presidential campaign. Until 
this time, it is only possible to buy the vouchers, however, 
nobody knows how to do it. How can any operations with vouchers 
be conducted if auctions are banned and it is impossible to 
estimate its price? 
  Belarusian businessmen consider that Valery Matsyushewski, 
chairman of the Committee for Administration of State Property, 
is an adversary of privatization. This is only partially true. 
Enemy number one of privatization is at the top. Mr. 
Matsyushewski only carries out his orders. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Valkowski: "Conversion Will Be Continued </F>
Despite Difficulties"] 
  [Text] How many Belarusian enterprises worked for defense? 
This is still unknown, but one can definitely say that at least 
a vast majority. All of them are currently living through hard 
times. There are no contracts, no subassemblies; nobody knows 
what to do with products piled up in warehouses (of course, 
Belarus used to produce only a part of the end product). 
Enterprises manufacturing civilian goods are in no better 
shape. It is hard to get access to new markets, some 
technologies have become desperately obsolete and thus, the 
products are not competitive. 
  There exists a well-known way to resolve the situation -- by 
means of structural reshaping and conversion. These are very 
complicated processes. 
  At the headquarters of Belarusian producers -- the State 
Committee for Industries and Interbranch Ties -- much has been 
done and is still being done in this field. 
  A program for the structural reshaping of Belarusian 
industries in the 1990's has been drafted, discussed, and passed 
by the Council of Ministers. According to Mikhail Prakharenka, 
department chief at the State Committee for Industries, the 
program has determined priority industries -- the building of 
metal-processing machines, electronic devices, instruments, 
computers and communication equipment, pharmacology, polymer, 
and construction materials. The priority nature of these 
branches will be supported by a package of advantages, direct 
investments from the state budget, and regulation of imports by 
means of tariffs. The aim of these measures is to fill the 
market, increase exports, and decrease imports by means of 
developing the branches capable of manufacturing goods that are 
currently imported. 
  The committee is paying serious attention to conversion. Due 
to assistance rendered by committee experts in 1993, a number of 
enterprises undergoing conversion have definitely changed the 
proportion between military and civilian production. In most 
cases the ratio of 92 to 8 percent has been changed to that of 8 
to 92 percent. There are fewer military contracts. However the 
state policy is also aimed at preserving the existing level of 
production of armaments and military hardware and enhancing 
exports of competitive products. It is also necessary to supply 
the Belarusian Armed Forces. 
  The scientific and technological potential of defense 
enterprises is quite high. Sometimes it cannot be used at 
civilian enterprises because military technologies are several 
decades ahead of the current level. The primary goal of 
conversion is to preserve the accomplishments and reorient the 
existing scientific and technological potential toward 
manufacturing competitive civilian products. Defense 
enterprises are engaged in a majority of nationwide projects and 
scientific-technological endeavors. 
  Many Minsk residents have abandoned hope of ever having 
telephones installed. The program drafted by committee experts 
will help speed up installation of telephones in Minsk homes. 
It envisions the use of high-tech equipment in the field of 
communication, namely radio telephones. This does not demand 
the laying of costly telephone cables. New automated telephone 
stations will also be cheaper than traditional ones. 
  It is hard to enumerate all concrete programs drafted for 
various industries. All in all, there are 17 of them. 
  The aim of these programs is well-defined -- to enhance the 
efficiency of production and reduce consumption of power and 
materials. The implementation of all the priority programs that 
involve more than thirty scientific staffs, has begun. There 
have been results, too. More than 2,000 sample products have 
been manufactured within the framework of these programs, 
including consumer goods never produced in Belarus. 
  Instrument-builders are unquestionable leaders in this 
competition. Thus far, they have designed and launched 
production of 28 models of wood-processing equipment, a number 
of new machines for the production of bearings, universal 
knee-type milling machines and lathes, as well as high-precision 
thread milling machines. 
  Machine builders can be proud of the new diesel engines, the 
new type of MAZ trucks, and truck-mounted cranes capable of 
lifting up to 20 tonnes. 
  Radio electronic devices deserve to be mentioned separately. 
This industry is the basis for developing other branches because 
it determines the technological level and exports potential of 
industries producing home appliances, radio electronic and 
information systems, means of communication, medical equipment, 
and various means of transportation. 
  A large number of radio electronic enterprises are 
concentrated in Minsk alone. Their modernization and realigning 
to novel technologies would entail huge costs. However it is 
clear that this is inevitable. The Belarusian computer market 
is flooded with equipment assembled in Asia which, very often, 
is of poor quality. Yet our personal computers are inferior even 
to these low-quality products. That is why our state 
enterprises and institutions bought almost $3 million worth of 
computers in 1993 alone. This money could have been paid to 
native producers provided they offered competitive equipment. 
  The State Committee for Industries concentrates its efforts 
on these targets. What we can produce ourselves we should 
produce here, and not buy overseas. Otherwise our industries 
will not survive.

  [Text] Moldavia's [Moldova] President Mircea Snegur and the 
Moldavian Parliament's Speaker Petr Luchinskiy met in Kishinev 
[Chisinau] Monday [23 May] with President Stepan Topal and other 
leaders of the non-recognized Gagauz Republic. The meeting took 
place behind closed doors. 
  As INTERFAX has learned from a source close to the Moldavian 
president, the leaders continued to discuss a bill on giving 
Gagauz settlements a special administrative status. Conclusions 
of experts from the Council of Europe and proposals of other 
international bodies were taken into account. 
  The Gagauz side is reported to have accepted a compromise 
formula, according to which the Gagauz country is an autonomous 
ethnic territorial entity rather than a state autonomous 
territorial entity on which it has insisted so far. 
  As the Moldavian President's State Counselor Victor 
Grebenshikov has told Interfax, "there are reasons to believe 
that the Gagauz issue will be solved soon." In his opinion, "a 
parliamentary commission has been working hard to draft a Gagauz 
autonomy accord." 
  "I think -- he remarked -- the document will ensure the 
interests of Moldavia -- its territorial integrity and 
sovereignty -- and will guarantee the existence and development 
of Gagauz settlements." 
  Grebenshikov stressed that during their talks the leaders of 
Moldavia and Gagauzia saw eye to eye on all matters discussed. 
  Meanwhile, during the work of the parliamentary commission 
on 
Gagauzia, the two sides have agreed to keep the concrete issues 
under discussion out of media coverage to avoid agitation.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 97 (587); </F>
compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] The talks between Kishinev [Chisinau] and Tiraspol 
on a settlement in the Dniester river valley will be difficult. 
The statement was made to the press in Kishinev by President 
Mircea Snegur. He said the Tiraspol side stands for making 
Moldova a federal state or confederation, which is unacceptable 
for Kishinev. 
  As for the special legal status of Tiraspol Snegur said one 
can judge about its form only when the first version of the 
draft law is available. So far one can only say that it is a 
question of decentralizing executive power, surrendering the 
functions of local self-government to Tiraspol in the framework 
of a common state with a common constitution, foreign policy, 
armed forces, and law enforcement bodies. 
  Snegur spoke with satisfaction that concrete steps are taken 
to restore the common economic space of Moldova. 
  The president said that the withdrawal of the 14th Russian 
Army from Moldova should not be linked with the special legal 
status of the area. 
  Meanwhile, according to the secretary of state of the 
self-proclaimed Transdniester Republic Valeriy Litskay the joint 
statement of the leaders of Kishinev and Tiraspol has not been 
duly applied in practice and negotiations have actually stopped. 
  Litskay said that at the moment the sides are actively 
preparing for the resumption of the talks but it is too early to 
speak of concrete proposals. According to him, groups of 
experts dealing with economic problems and the settlement of 
mutual debts are the most active. 
  As for defining the status of the river valley, the work in 
this direction has practically stopped, Litskay said. 
  Tiraspol is linking the absence of the progress at the talks 
with the fact that Kishinev wants to resolve the problem of the 
Gagauzi ethnic minority and then use the solution as a pattern 
for defining the status of Tiraspol. It wants to win the 
support of international organizations in that.

  [Text] The commanders of Russia's 14th Army deployed in 
Transdniestria [Dniester] have called on the Russian government 
to withdraw Russian citizenship from the leaders of the 
self-styled Republic of Transdniestria. They accused almost all 
Tiraspol leaders holding Russian passports of abusing their 
status as Russian citizens. The appeal follows compromising 
evidence against Tiraspol officials that the commanders have at 
their disposal. 
  Military commander of Tiraspol Mikhail Bergman in an 
interview with INTERFAX accused regional leaders not only of 
financial irregularities and corruption, but also of 
uncontrolled distribution of weapons to dubious individuals and 
former criminals. "I am in possession of evidence indicating 
that a total of 908 units of firearms were handed over to 
different people under orders from President Igor Smirnov 
himself", he said. Bergman hopes that this and the local 
militants' involvement in last year's parliamentary revolt in 
Moscow will bring an immediate response from Moscow. 
  Bergman also said that the Transdniestrian officials took 
advantage of their Russian citizenship to travel freely to the 
West where they keep secret accounts for money laundering. 
Smirnov himself has a total of 3.5 million dollars on his bank 
deposit in Austria withdrawing a further 1.5 million dollars 
from that account at the end of last year, according to Bergman. 
He said other Tiraspol leaders were no better.

  [Text] Recently, a Kazakhstani delegation headed by Prime 
Minister Sergey Tereshchenko visited the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. On the agenda of this official visit were issues of trade 
and economic cooperation between Kazakhstan and Iran. The 
Iranian first deputy president received the Kazakhstani 
governmental delegation. 
  During the meeting, Mr. Tereshchenko remarked on the already 
existing and very close relationship between Kazakhstan and 
Iran. He noted that during the visit of Iranian President 'Ali 
Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani to Almaty, several important documents 
on bilateral cooperation were signed. Mr. Tereshchenko said 
that this visit of his was to activate work on the fulfillment 
of the agreement and the removal of obstacles in the way of 
increasing mutually beneficial trade and economic cooperation. 
Mr. Tereshchenko expressed his hope that this visit of his 
would provide a new ground for widening bilateral cooperation in 
economy and trade. He noted that Kazakhstan was interested in 
building relations with Iran in such spheres as land, sea, and 
air transportation, trade of oil products, economic minerals, 
metals, agricultural products, as well the banking business. 
  The first deputy president of Iran, Mr. Hasan Habibi, in his 
turn hailed the strengthening relations of the two countries, 
noting that on 15 May 1994 the first air route between the 
capital cities of Kazakhstan and Iran was opened. This route 
will be served by airliners of the Iranian national air company 
Iran Air. 
  During his stay in Iran, Mr. Tereshchenko also visited the 
former Iranian capital city of Esfahan. A negotiation on the 
Kazakhstani-Iranian cooperation in the sphere of metallurgy and 
exchange of technology and specialists was held. In Tehran, the 
Kazakhstani delegation held intensive negotiations with the 
representatives of Iranian business circles on organizing 
banking cooperation which will help simplify calculations 
between the trade companies of the two countries. The 
Kazakhstani Minister of Energetics and Fuel Resources, Mr. Kadyr 
Baykenov, met with the Iranian Minister of Petroleum, Mr. Gholam

<F P=106> [Report by Marina Lebedeva and Vladimir Ardayev: "Human </F>
Rights in Conference Hall and Outside It"] 
  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- The International Conference 
on Human Rights, "Public Organizations and Power: Interaction 
in a Democratic Society," has ended in Alma-Ata. 
  The discussion corresponded fully with the main theme of the 
conference. But the "thorniest" aspects inevitably concerned 
events unfolding nearby, outside the conference hall of the 
Alma-Ata sociopolitical center. 
  Formally, following the adoption of the new Constitution and 
the reconstruction of the main legal base, practically no laws 
remain in Kazakhstan which directly violate human rights -- 
human rights must not be violated by law here. But this year's 
elections have shown the weakness and lack of coordination of 
the social associations and their vulnerability before the 
"party in power," something that CSCE observers emphasized, as 
well as the undeveloped state or almost complete absence of 
independent mass media in Kazakhstan. 
  One example confirming the fairness of this analysis came up 
straight away on the first day of the conference's work. On the 
eve of its opening, 16 May, an unsanctioned rally of pickets, 
several of whom had declared a hunger strike, broke out on the 
square outside the building of the parliament, which had 
gathered for the latest stage of its first session. The militia 
drove the hunger strikers out of the square, and five of them 
were arrested. This was prompted by an actual parliament 
decision, which essentially outlawed not only obvious 
demonstrations, but also "other gatherings of citizens." 
  The speech by V. Lyubushkin, a deputy from the North 
Kazakhstan Oblast Council [Maslikhat], devoted to the "Russian 
question," was a dramatic one. He cited "acts of intimidation 
to others," applied by the Kazakhstani authorities toward those 
who are trying to defend the rights of the Russian-speaking 
population, as a state policy distortion that is exacerbating 
this question. Thus, Boris Suprunyuk, chairman of the "Russian 
Community of North Kazakhstan" and a journalist, is under arrest. 
  The conflictual situation arose during the work of the civil 
rights conference with the sociopolitical newspaper 
KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA -- the most popular Russian-language 
publication in the Republic. Quite recently, the "Kazakhstan" 
television and radio broadcasting company was transformed into a 
corporation under the control of the authorities by being merged 
with a private television company -- and a presidential 
representative was appointed in it, in the person of press 
service leader I. Romanov. 
  At IZVESTIYA's request, assessing the conference that has 
ended, Burkutbay Ayaganov, deputy chief of the internal policy 
section in the president's apparatus and the Kazakhstani 
Republic Cabinet of Ministers, who participated in it, called it 
"effective," and said it testified to democratic Kazakhstan's 
desire to become a rule-of-law state. 
  When asked to comment on the cases of the violation of human 
rights which occurred in the past few days outside the 
conference hall, the deputy chief of section answered that he is 
not prepared to do so as he does not have sufficient information 
at his disposal.

  [Text] The main purpose of the visit to Tajikistan by the 
President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs is participation in a congress of the Tajik Union 
of Science and Industry on Wednesday [25 May]. He disclosed 
this to INTERFAX on Monday in Dushanbe where he arrived as the 
head of a 23 person delegation. 
  Volskiy thinks the contacts of industrialists are now 
extremely necessary for both Russia and Tajikistan because there 
is a burning need to discuss further cooperation and begin 
seeking a way out of the crisis. "We cannot help it, because we 
would find life difficult without each other," Volskiy said. 
  Asked about the expected results of the working visit 
Volskiy 
said an agreement with the Tajik union was drafted and Russian 
businessmen would gladly sign it, if Tajik colleagues approved 
it. 
  The visit will last till 26 May. On Tuesday Volskiy is to 
meet the chairman of parliament Emomali Rakhmonov.

  [Text] Days of Kazakhstan are being held in Uzbekistan. A 
few hours ago the delegation from our fraternal republic led by 
Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of the Republic of Kazakhstan, 
arrived in Tashkent. Islam Karimov, president of the Republic 
of Uzbekistan, and Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, Held a news conference: 
  [Begin Karimov recording] My friend is in our country at a 
time when Uzbeks and Kazakhs [are meeting here]. Our 
forefathers were the same. The two peoples' intellectual and 
working lives and wishes are the same. If we look at the 
intellectual and working life of the people today it is 
difficult, it is a difficult time for Kazakhstan and for 
Uzbekistan. There are all kinds of difficulties in Uzbekistan 
and similarly in Kazakhstan. In Kazakhstan there are forces 
that cannot accept its independence, and in Uzbekistan there 
also forces that cannot accept its independence. 
  Sharing what my friend has just said I would like to say 
that 
if we are together our backs will be strong and if everyone 
works together [words indistinct] we will reach our destiny and 
our aims. Our aim is for the well-being of the Kazakhs and the 
Uzbeks, for all those living in the region. There is 
everything. Our peoples are hardworking. There is everything. 
Our aims are in good faith. [words indistinct]. Like today, 
[words indistinct] we need to be together. Again, I would like 
to welcome Nursultan Nazarbayev to the Days of Kazakhstan in 
Uzbekistan [words indistinct] which is of political and 
cultural significance. I think that today and tomorrow these 
days of Kazakhstan in Uzbekistan [words indistinct]. Kazakhs 
will meet Uzbeks -- meet their friends -- and they will have a 
lot to talk about. The Uzbeks have a great deal to talk about 
and so do the Kazakhs. I think that the meetings of two friends

  [Text] An official Kazakhstan delegation, led by President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev, arrived in Tashkent today. It includes 
Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko, parliament's Speaker Abish 
Kekilbayev, and other senior officials. 
  Presidents Islam Karimov and Nursultan Nazarbayev had a 
meeting today, then they attended the opening of Kazakhstan's 
exhibition "Science, New Technology and Conversion" at the 
exhibition center. The head of our state laid flowers at the 
memorial to Alisher Navoi. 
  Members of the Kazakh delegation met with their Uzbek 
counterparts. Both presidents and members of the official 
delegations attended the opening ceremony of Days of Kazakhstan 
at the Torkeston center. It was followed by a concert of Uzbek 
music. The Days of Kazakhstan will last until 27 May and will 
contribute to closer integration between the economies of two 
countries. 
  The two presidents were interviewed at the airport today. 
  [Begin Nazarbayev recording] Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have 
not held an event like this since 1977. Earlier, such events 
were mostly political. This is the first event of its kind 
since the two countries gained their independence and 
sovereignty. Around 600 people from various regions of 
Kazakhstan have arrived in Tashkent. Among them are scholars, 
businessmen, leaders of enterprises and farms, and others. 
  The aim is first to familiarize them with the reforms in 
Uzbekistan and their progress. Second, as you know, [Uzbek 
President] Islam Karimovich and I have signed an agreement on 
encouraging cooperation between the two countries. We want the 
economies of the two countries to compliment each other -- 
Kazakhstan has certain things which are not available in 
Uzbekistan and vice versa. I hope that a commission, which has 
been set up by the two presidents will contribute to 
encouraging closer economic cooperation without bureacratic 
hurdles. A similar event will be held in Kazakhstan at the 
beginning of winter this year. 
  Such events are important in strengthening ties between the 
two countries. Through them the two nations will get to know 
each other better, will learn about the market reforms in the 
respective countries. Kazakhs and Uzbeks were once considered 
as one nation. We have common roots, similar languages, and a 
common mentality. There is nothing that can divide us, and there 
never has been. We have always been together and all we have to 
do now is to revive these ties. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>
  [Text] Vladikavkaz, 23 May -- Mobile groups of Russian 
troops have stepped up control over the safety strip between 
North Ossetia and Ingushetia. ITAR-TASS learned on Monday that 
this had been done in line with an instruction by Vladimir 
Lozovoy, the head of the interim administration. 
  In the meantime, a wide-scale "transport" operation aimed to 
strengthen the state of emergency regime is under way in the 
zone where the regime is in force. It envisages thorough 
check-ups of vehicles, trains, train stations, and airports. It 
was reported that dozens of fire-arms, hand-grenades, various 
rounds of ammunition, and drugs had been confiscated from 
passengers over the past three days. 
  Information obtained by ITAR-TASS from military sources 
makes 
it possible to conclude that the situation in the North Ossetian 
rayons where the state of emergency regime is in force until 31 
May remains relatively calm. No night shellings or attacks on 
army or militia posts or interethnic conflicts have been 
registered here in the past 24 hours.

  [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- Russian presidential spokesman 
Vyacheslav Kostikov called on the citizens of North Ossetia and 
Ingushetia to resist provocations aimed at thwarting the process 
of conflict settlement in the region. 
  In a statement issued on Monday, Kostikov said that 
extremists have lately stepped up their activity in the war zone 
in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. Violence against civilians, 
hostage taking and killings continue in the region. There have 
been attempts to involve Russian soldiers and officers carrying 
out a peace-keeping mission in the region to involve in the war. 
  "Especially inadmissible are the facts when representatives 
of the local administrations become organisers of and 
participants in acts of violence. Russian authorities will not 
tolerate glaring violations of human rights and law in the zone 
of the state of emergency," Kostikov said. 
  Calling on the people of North Ossetia and Ingushetia to 
resist provocations of extremists seeking to derail the peace 
process in the region, Russian President Boris Yeltsin stresses 
that law enforcement bodies in the war zone have all necessary 
rights and means to stamp out extremism and protect the 
civilians, Kostikov said.

Voronezh Governor A. Kovalev has signed the decree "On Payment

  Henceforth and until times improve, enterprises, by 
agreement 
with the administration, will pay their taxes in the form of 
their own output. The local authorities intend to use barter to 
acquire the goods which the oblast needs. Enterprises' debts to 
the budget will be considered cleared only after deals have been 
completed by an administrative intermediary.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Krasnyanskiy, head of the St. </F>
Petersburg Property Fund, by Valentina Shestakova; place and 
date not given: "I Consider Myself a Member of Sobchak's Team"] 
  [Text] A new head of the Property Fund has been 
appointed--Valeriy Krasnyanskiy. For seven generations the 
tradition has been for the eldest sons in the Krasnyanskiy 
family to became jurists. In 1971 Valeriy finished postgraduate 
studies. In 1980 he began to teach at the university's law 
school. 
  In 1986, together with Petr Filippov, Anatoliy Chubays, 
and others, he took part in creating the Perestroyka Club; in 
1989 he was in charge of Yuriy Boldyrev's election campaign. In 
1990--elected to the city soviet; 1993--appointed a member of 
the Central Electoral Commission of the Russian Federation. 
  [Krasnyanskiy] I have not had any illusions regarding 
communism almost since childhood. In school, I studied with 
opposition-minded professors and associate professors who ended 
up there via the second Leningrad case. I envisaged the reform 
of the Soviet system as more evolutionary, through. 
  I was not a supporter of shock therapy: First we needed to 
correct the situation in the economy, then free people's 
spiritual life from control, and only then change the political 
structure. However, we want everything and right away. Well, 
this seems to be Russia's fate... 
  [Shestakova] Does it not seem to you that there is something 
insulting to the individual about voucher privatization? 
  [Krasnyanskiy] Each of us received a voucher and had the 
opportunity to invest it. Those who were luckier and smarter 
found a good place for their vouchers and receive dividends. In 
addition, each employee owns part of his enterprise's property. 
Everybody was given a chance to become an owner. 
  [Shestakova] St. Petersburg is ahead of practically all the 
regions in the pace of privatization. 
  But have we not paid too high a price? Do you not think that 
running in front of the locomotive was somewhat artificial? 
  [Krasnyanskiy] On the all-Russia scale--no. Life always 
makes 
it difficult for those who are ahead. But what has been taking 
place is moral, because the concept of voucher privatization 
turned out to be viable. Vouchers stimulated the formation of 
the stock market and created conditions for attracting 
investment for enterprise development. 
  Seven million privatization vouchers have been collected in 
the city, which exceeds St. Petersburg's population. The process 
of secondary privatization is beginning, where small investors' 
shares will pay off. 
  The second stage will begin after 1 July and will proceed in 
keeping with the "Post-Voucher Privatization Concept" developed 
by the State Committee for Administration of State Property. 
Those who did not want to undergo reorganization have been left 
on the sidelines. Now they face either gradual privatization or 
getting the status of a state-owned entity. Socialist methods of 
administration will be applied to such organizations: 
record-keeping and control, strict limitations on wages, and so 
on. 
  [Shestakova] Grounds keepers will appear on the streets 
again... 
  [Krasnyanskiy] Apparently so. 
  After 1 July stock will be sold only for money. Therefore, 
before assuming 51 percent of stock, the labor collective will 
have to think it over many times. The best privatization option 
will be the first one, under which the collective keeps 25 
percent of nonvoting preferred stock, which is more attractive 
for investors. 
  No restrictions are envisaged for foreigners in buying and 
selling stock. Although we should not count too much on 
foreigners' help--they are in no hurry to come to Russia. 
  [Shestakova] Will there be land vouchers? 
  [Krasnyanskiy] As securities--probably not. But investors 
want to have ownership rights not only to the enterprise but 
also to the land lot on which it is situated. The Property Fund 
has prepared the corresponding documents; they are currently in 
the approval stage. So selling land will be permitted de facto. 
Its value will be determined by a scale approved by the city 
council, after applying certain coefficients. 
  Among the new features in the government program of 
privatization of state and municipal enterprises in the Russian 
Federation after 1 July is the possibility of putting up for 
investment auction both entire enterprises as a whole (not just 
a block of stock) and selling through an investment bid the 
rights of cofounder. 
  At the end of May the concept of the St. Petersburg program 
will be submitted to the judgment of the government. 
  [Shestakova] And here, again, "there are possibilities," 
since the program of post-voucher privatization is not yet 
ready, which means that the legislative base will be formed as 
we go. 
  [Krasnyanskiy] Unfortunately, you are quite close. First, 
the 
program does not specify the time frame for the transfer of 
payments, and on these grounds frictions may develop with the 
treasury and the tax inspection. Also, it is not clear what 
constitutes directly privatization activities of our fund, since 
part of it is taxable and the rest is not. The confusion arises 
mainly because normative acts are drafted by people far removed 
from jurisprudence. 
  [Shestakova] Any person in a government job is guilty 
all-around these days. Remember, like in the movie "Wedding in 
Malinovka": "a change of authority..." Today it is the whites, 
tomorrow the reds, and then the striped. The one at the end of 
the line is at fault. And this usually befalls the direct 
implementers of privatization at the slightest shift in the 
political course. Does this not frighten you? 
  [Krasnyanskiy] Every reform is associated with difficulties; 
it inevitably brings down the standard of living, causes 
discontent, and becomes associated not with the objective 
process but with the people implementing these reforms. 
  If I find myself to be the last in line, I will be guided 
exclusively by my own convictions and the law. 
  [Shestakova] What team do you associate yourself with? 
  [Krasnyanskiy] The reformist one. And as a functionary--with 
Sobchak's team.

soviet--both winning in Berdsk. Viktor Kuznetsov, secretary of 
the oblast committee of the Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation, answers our questions today. 
  [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Viktor Yegorovich, how many 
communists are there in Novosibirsk? 
  [Kuznetsov] The Communist Party of the Russian Federation 
has 
approximately 4,500 members. An oblast committee of the party 
and rayon committees operate. 
  [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] What, in each rayon? 
  [Kuznetsov] In all but three rural districts, although there 
are communists there, of course. 
  [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] We all remember full well what the 
former CPSU oblast committee was. Is the oblast committee of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation similar? 
  [Kuznetsov] No, it is not at all the same thing. Our oblast 
committee is made up of people elected from the rayons: 56 
persons working on an unpaid basis. We hold plenums bimonthly. 
There is, naturally, no administrative system such as there was, 
just as there are not the opportunities for influence that the 
CPSU oblast committee had. 
  [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Does the Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation consider itself the successor of the CPSU? I 
do not mean only in the ideological sense.... 
  [Kuznetsov] In a property respect we undoubtedly consider 
ourselves the successor of the CPSU. Although this is a question 
around which there are a great many difficulties. But this is 
not the most important issue, the main thing for us is 
restoration of the organization. The people who have today 
gathered together in the party ranks have done so not because 
they will be given some position for this and not because they 
can shout at demonstrations. Yes, there are people who express 
themselves this way, but normal people who adhere to a balanced 
position have come together in the Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation. At this time, for example, we are discussing 
the party program, and I can say that such documents were never 
discussed so thoroughly before. 
  [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] The CPSU had immense experience in 
the most diverse matters. Why do you reject it? 
  [Kuznetsov] This is a very complex issue. We are reaching 
the 
general conclusion that we cannot yet make full evaluations as 
to why and in connection with what everything happened. What was 
good and what was bad. It is still too early to speak of all 
this with confidence. Work on comprehension of the processes is 
under way, of course, research centers and scholars are at work. 
But, I repeat, it is still too early to draw the final 
conclusions. 
  [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Who is in the ranks of the Communist 
Party today? 
  [Kuznetsov] Older people are preponderant, undoubtedly. 
There 
are few young people as yet, but there are young men in the 
university, for example, who are joining us. More than 30,000 
young people joined the Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation nationwide in the period from last October through 
this April. What is happening in the country is forcing people 
to think, comprehend the situation, and make a choice. 
  [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] You are united, most likely, by a 
rejection of Gorbachev and his policy? 
  [Kuznetsov] Well, Gorbachev is Gorbachev.... Rejection, of 
course. There were big mistakes and much of what is now seen as 
treachery. We have to evaluate why it happened this way. What 
enabled events to develop this way, not otherwise. There were, 
after all, the rules.... But the nomenklatura was victorious. 
When the primary party organizations attempted to depose the 
general secretary, so to speak, he held on to his position with 
the aid of the bureaucratic machinery and the entire 
nomenklatura system. 
  [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] What, then, there are no people from 
the former nomenklatura in the Novosibirsk organization of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation? 
  [Kuznetsov] Why not? There are! And why not, for example, 
lend an ear to Aleksandr Pavlovich Filatov, former secretary of 
the oblast party committee, who left all communists thinking 
good thoughts about his work in this office. He has now been 
restored to membership of our party. And Vladimir Aleksandrovich 
Mindolin also is a member of the Novosibirsk organization of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation. 
  [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Do you intend to form your faction 
in 
the oblast soviet? 
  [Kuznetsov] The times now, it seems to me, are not such that 
it is necessary to strictly distinguish a party faction. Reality 
compels a search for a broader base. The questions that confront 
us are very complex, and we need to do more than just go about 
carrying a flag.... After all, if we say that it is only we who 
know "what's right," and no one else, it is simply time to leave 
the political arena. Society is today oriented toward many 
goals, which frequently differ considerably among themselves, 
and for this reason a pragmatic approach is greatly needed. 
  [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] There are, as we all know, several 
communist parties here. What are their relations like? 
  [Kuznetsov] There will be no automatic combination--you may 
be sure of this. Yes, we are for a union of communist parties, 
but the decision we adopted was this: Each party with its own 
rules and its own program may join the union and work in it as 
if on a confederative basis. But there is no common roof nor 
will there be.... 
  As far as Novosibirsk is concerned, there are just two 
serious organizations here: the Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation and the Russian Communist Workers Party. The Russian 
Communist Workers Party has its own image, distinct from ours, 
but this does not prevent us mounting many actions together. As 
far as the other parties are concerned, we jokingly call them 
"two-bus parties".... You do not need to be told why, I 
believe.... 
  [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Your aim is to come to power? 
  [Kuznetsov] This is the aim of every party. For us it is a 
strategic prospect. We realize that no one party has a chance of 
coming to power in today's Russia. And the goal is to create a 
normal pragmatic opposition which assumes responsibility for the 
search for the country's escape from the crisis. What is this 
political accord about which so much is being said today?! It is 
just another political show, beneath the clamor of which the 
strict antipopular policy continues. And a change of course 
could occur only at the demand of a broad coalition of political 
forces, but not of one party. 
  [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] The final question. Does Gennadiy 
Zyuganov want to become president? 
  [Kuznetsov] It is hard to say whether he does or not. But 
responding to such a question at a recent party forum, Zyuganov 
said that all our misfortunes are happening because a 
presidential version of administration of the state has been 
imposed on Russia. We have already surpassed the world in terms 
of the number of presidents. We have no need of a presidential 
federation of republics--it is time to switch to a normal system.

  [Text] Murmansk May 23 TASS -- Great Britain and Russia 
must closely cooperate in peace time, as during World War II, 
British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd said on Monday. He 
arrived on a three-day official visit to Russia on Sunday. 
  Sharing his impressions of his trip in the Kola peninsula, 
the British diplomat noted that this region has great prospects. 
They are linked with the development of the Murmansk port, vast 
natural resources and talent of the people living here. Upon 
return to Great Britain Hurd is expected to meet with 
representatives of business circles and tell them about the 
results of his journey. He stressed that it is necessary to pay 
a special attention to humanitarian cooperation. Great Britain 
plans to finance a blood cancer treatment project and to provide 
necessary equipment to one of the Murmansk hospitals, the 
British foreign minister pointed out. 
  Head of the British Foreign Office Douglas Hurd and Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev offered flowers at the memorial 
in honour of British and U.S. navy personnel who were killed 
while conducting sea convoys with allied aid to Murmansk. The 
heads of foreign departments visited the navy museum. They had 
conversation with commander of the Northern Sea Fleet Admiral 
Oleg Yerofeyev on board the cruiser "Admiral Nakhimov". The day 
before the talks Andrey Kozyrev had noted that as of today 
Russian nuclear force rockets are no longer targeted at Great 
Britain, similarly British missiles are also no longer aimed at 
Russia. This symbolises new relations of trust between the two 
countries, Kozyrev said. 
  Douglas Hurd and Andrey Kozyrev left by a special plane for 
Moscow the same day. The British foreign minister will continue 
discussing bilateral cooperation. In particular, he is to meet 
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. 
  Then he will leave Moscow for Kiev. Replying to a question 
about the aim of this visit to Kiev, the British diplomat said 
that during his one-day visit to Ukraine he will meet with 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. Great Britain wants to 
assist democratic reforms and Ukraine's movement towards the 
market economy as well as to see Ukraine live in peace with its 
neighbours, especially with Russia, Douglas Hurd added.

  [Text] Murmansk, 22 May -- Cooperation between Russia and 
Britain is developing very well, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said after talks here with his British colleague Douglas 
Hurd, who has arrived in Russia on a three-day official visit. 
  The Russian foreign minister said that British Prime 
Minister 
John Major's meeting with Russian Federation President Boris 
Yeltsin was still quite a recent event, while a new and 
important event for mutual relations was now on the agenda: the 
first state visit to Russia by Queen Elizabeth II. 
  Kozyrev mentioned the broad list of issues discussed at the 
current talks, in particular, preparations for the political 
meeting of leaders of the G-7 and Russia in Naples, the working 
out of an agreement on partnership between Russia and the 
European Union, the prospects of cooperation between Russia and 
NATO, the Bosnian crisis, and Moscow's relations with the Baltic 
countries. Significant attention, in his words, was paid to 
finding ways to step up the activities of the CSCE during 
preparations for the summit meeting of the member countries of 
this international forum. There was also a productive exchange 
of views on ways of developing regional cooperation, including 
cooperation with Murmansk. The minister said that "Britain was a 
partner with whom Russia was holding a stable, open and friendly 
dialogue." 
  The head of the British Foreign Office noted that his 
country 
was playing pioneering role in ties with Murmansk. In Hurd's 
words, this role was clearly manifested in the past wars, and it 
continues now, as demonstrated by the present visit, the first 
by a British foreign secretary to the polar regions of Russia. 
"Agreement has been reached on all the issues we discussed," the 
head of the Foreign Office said. "There are three major 
organizations in Europe - NATO, the EC, and the CSCE. In the 
early stages of their existence they were dealing with the 
problem of overcoming confrontation, but now a new stage has 
begun, and work is under way with the aim of reaching accord. 
Russia is playing a key role in this process. I hope a 
cooperation agreement between Russia and the European Union will 
be signed as early as June. We in Britain at any rate will be 
striving towards this. We also expect Russia to reach accord 
with NATO on the basis of the Partnership for Peace program, and 
we expect the CSCE to become a more effective tool in overcoming 
international crises."

  [Text] Murmansk, 23 May -- The talks between the foreign 
ministers of Russia and Britain held here today were conducted 
in the spirit of constructive and frank exchange of views. The 
talks were part of the current official visit to Russia by the 
head of the British Foreign Office. An ITAR-TASS correspondent 
has learned from sources close to the Russian delegation that 
the British side was interested in Moscow's reaction to 
Ukraine's appeal to the UN Security Council regarding the 
situation in the Crimea. Russia has nothing against such an 
appeal and believes that a call for a political settlement 
coming from the UN Security Council would be of use to all sides. 
  According to the same sources, during the talks the two 
sides 
discussed crises in various CIS countries in terms of a more 
active CSCE participation in their settlement. On the Bosnian 
issue, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to acting on 
the basis of common understanding of the aims and in the spirit 
of agreements reached at the Geneva meeting of the foreign 
ministers of Russia, the United States, and five EC countries on 
13 May. 
  Discussing the issue of Russia joining NATO's Partnership 
for 
Peace program, participants in the meeting agreed that military- 
political cooperation should not be restricted by the provisions 
of the outline document. Russia is a nuclear state, and it 
cannot be put on a level with other countries. An agreement 
that would take its specific features into account has to be 
drawn up. The forthcoming visit to Brussels by Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev will be the first step in this direction. 
The agreement concerned -- be it a protocol or a program -- has 
to answer the question of how Russia is to cooperate with NATO 
in such areas as peacekeeping, conversion, consultations, and 
contacts between the military.

  [Text] Moscow, 23 May -- "The Crimean issue is too 
important to be used as a card in the presidential election 
campaign in Ukraine." This was said today by Russia's State Duma 
Chairman Ivan Rybkin at a meeting with Douglas Hurd, Britain's 
minister for foreign and Commonwealth affairs [title as 
received]. 
  The speaker of Russia's lower house also said "that 
everything happening in Crimea is Ukraine's internal affair," 
and that "the peoples of the peninsula have the right to 
self-determination, but within the framework of Ukraine and on 
the basis of the principles of the CSCE." 
  Cooperation between the two countries' parliaments was also 
discussed during the meeting. On behalf of the House of 
Commons, Douglas Hurd invited a Duma delegation headed by Ivan 
Rybkin to visit Great Britain this December.

  [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- The Group of Seven 
industrialized nations is interested in Russia's joining its 
activities, in the creation of the G-8 group, said visiting 
British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd at a meeting with 
journalists at an international press center today. 
  The British foreign minister, currently on an official visit 
to Russia, pointed out the importance of his talks with his 
Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, which were held in Murmansk. 
  In reply to a question asked by ITAR-TASS about his attitude 
to Russia's economic partnership with Western Europe, Hurd said 
that concluding an agreement on cooperation between Russia and 
EC will be an important step in Russia's joining the common 
market. He believes this might become a reality until the end 
of June. Hurd stressed that it is possible to say even now that 
signing this document will boost business contacts and give them 
an important impetus. 
  Commenting on the idea of Russia's joining the NATO 
Partnership for Peace programme, the British foreign minister 
said that this concept provides for an individual approach to 
every country. Hurd expressed the hope that Russia will be able 
to find its place in the Partnership for Peace programme. 
  Touching upon the situation in the Crimea, Hurd declared 
that 
London considers the Crimea to be an inalienable part of 
Ukraine. At the same time Hurd pointed out that Kiev should 
flexibly react to the opinion of Crimean residents and take 
Russia's position into account. The British foreign minister 
pointed out that Russia has a full right to carry out 
peace-keeping operations in countries of the former Soviet 
Union, provided these operations are conducted at the request of 
their governments and in the spirit of U.N. and CSCE documents. 
  On Tuesday, the British foreign minister will meet with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, during the meeting the Russian 
president will be handed in a letter from the British Queen 
Elizabeth II, in which she confirms her intention to pay a state 
visit to Russia before the end of this year.

  [Text] Moscow, 24 May -- The meetings with Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
in the Russian capital were "most useful," Douglas Hurd, British 
secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth Affairs, said, 
speaking to correspondents at Vnukovo Airport today at the end 
of a three-day official visit to Russia. 
  The British foreign secretary declared that particular 
attention was paid to the situation in Crimea during his 
conversation with the Russian president. He said that the 
Russian side occupies a clear and precisely expressed position, 
considering this issue to be Ukraine's internal affair. The 
Crimean peninsula is a part of Ukrainian territory, therefore 
disputes arising around it must be resolved through dialogue 
between Kiev and Simferopol. 
  Overall, Douglas Hurd summed up, complete understanding was 
reached on the whole range of problems discussed during the 
visit. The Foreign Office head confirmed that Queen Elizabeth II 
has accepted an invitation from the Russian president to visit 
Russia, and that this visit could take place before the end of 
this year. 
  The same day the British minister left Moscow for Kiev.

  [Text] Moscow, 23 May -- The level of cooperation in 
Russian- British relations is now higher than in Russia's 
relations with many other countries. "The sides not only do not 
have any differences on any serious issues, there are not even 
any significant divergences of positions," this was the 
evaluation of the present state of relations between Russia and 
the United Kingdom by a close advisor to the Russian foreign 
minister on the results of talks between Andrey Kozyrev and 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. The visit of the head 
of British diplomacy, which began in Murmansk on 22 May, was 
noted for a symbolic event today. D. Hurd became the first 
foreign minister of a western country to visit the strategic 
base of the Russian fleet at Severomorsk. 
  "This is our latest true gesture of partnership with NATO," 
the Russian diplomat said, commenting on the British minister's 
visit to the Admiral Nakhimov, a Northern Fleet heavy cruiser. 
Although we still await the signing of agreements--a framework 
document and a special protocol on mutual relations between 
Russia and the North Atlantic alliance, reflecting its special 
nature as a nuclear power --partnership between the Russian 
Federation and NATO is already in fact being implemented. The 
same day, the diplomat reported, the high-ranking representative 
of NATO's military command is awaited in Severomorsk. 
  According to the Russian diplomat, among western partners 
"the British probably understand us most of all," and here the 
personal position of the Foreign Office head plays a part. For 
example, on the question of Russia's participation from the 
outset in a political conference between G-7 countries with 
equal rights, Great Britain "was one of the first to stretch out 
its hand to us," and the summit in Naples this summer will be 
the premiere of the political "eight." 
  In relation to an agreement between the Russian Federation 
and the European Union, London is in favor of this accord being 
reached as soon as possible. Until recently, the Foreign Office 
representative explained, two unsolved questions had largely 
remained in the way to a triumphant ceremony. The first, where 
the "ball was in the Russian court," concerned the lifting of 
restrictions on the activities of foreign banks in Russia. A 
solution was found--for some banks conditions will be improved 
as of now, and for others--in the foreseeable future. The 
second matter is linked with the position of the partners, first 
and foremost the French, and their commercial interests. Russia 
was offered lower quotas than at present in trade in materials 
of the nuclear fuel cycle, to which Moscow could not agree. 
Experts from the two sides are working on the problem, and 
according to information just received, they are close to a 
compromise. As far as London is concerned, it favors an 
agreement being signed in June. 
  Close interaction is also to be seen in efforts to settle 
the 
situation in Bosnia. It is being implemented by the sides in 
the spirit of the communique of the ministerial meeting between 
Russia, the United States, and the five countries of the 
European Union on Bosnia, held in Geneva on 13 May. 
  As far as the Russian Federation's relations with the Baltic 
countries are concerned, in the opinion of the British partners, 
the package of agreements with Latvia on the withdrawal of 
Russian troops, which also contains guarantees of the rights of 
military pensioners, could also extend to the Estonian side. 
According to the Russian diplomat, London will try to convince 
Tallinn of this. 
  Speaking about Douglas Hurd's trip to the Ukraine next 
Tuesday, the Russian diplomat said that the British side strives 
to prevent any worsening of relations between Moscow and Kiev, 
and therefore follows the principle of "no harm." In fact other 
Western countries have also adopted a similar position. As for 
the declarations by Ukrainian representatives about their 
intention to appeal to the UN Security Council regarding the 
situation in Crimea, Moscow has told the British side it favored 
this major international body taking an interest in this 
problem, calling for a settlement through peaceful, political 
means. This would cool down some hotheads on various sides. 
  It is not a coincidence that the meeting between the Russian 
and British foreign ministers took place in Murmansk. This 
region has a vast potential, where bilateral cooperation has 
great prospects, and generates serious interest in Great 
Britain. Douglas Hurd expressed hope that plans will go ahead 
to twin Murmansk and Aberdeen, a large British port and center 
of oil and gas industry. 
  The head of the British diplomacy remembered the war time 
camaraderie and expressed his conviction that in peaceful times 
the cooperation between the two countries must be equally close. 
The United Kingdom, he said, is planning to send official 
representatives to Murmansk to mark Victory Day, which had been 
achieved with some help from the marines of the military and 
merchant fleet of Great Britain, who had taken part of Arctic 
convoys delivering aid from the allies to the town during the 
war.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Pakhomov] </F>
  [Text] Gosport May 23 TASS -- British and Russian military 
sailors rejoined for the first time after decades of cold war at 
a welcoming ceremony for a Russian submarine that arrived on a 
visit in Britain on Monday. 
  The craft belonging to the Russian Northern Fleet called at 
the Navy base Dolphin in the town of Gosport in the south of 
Britain, marking the first ever visit of a Russian submarine to 
this country. 
  The Russian sailors received a hearty welcome with a 
military 
band, gun salute and guard of honour which would have been 
unheard of only several years ago. 
  This is a historic event, base Chief of Staff Jeff Goodwin 
told ITAR-TASS. During the World War Two Russia and Britain 
were allies, but then the Cold War set in and the base was the 
main watchdog for Soviet subs in the Northern Atlantic, he 
continued. But now everything has changed and Russian sailors 
are welcome guests in Britain, Goodwin said. 
  "When the military make friends, there are fewer chances 
that 
a war will break out," Russian submarine Captain Sergey Rozanov 
said. "I cannot even imagine myself fighting against Jeff," he 
said. 
  During the visit, the submarine crew led by Rear Admiral 
Georgiy Titarenko, first deputy chief of staff of the Northern 
Fleet, will meet with British military officials, tour warships, 
navy bases in Gosport and Portsmouth, and the museum of 
submarines. The Russian sailors will also take a trip to London 
and hold receptions aboard the submarine for their British 
colleagues. 
  On May 25 the submarine will leave Britain and head for its 
base in Severomorsk.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Golts report: "NATO-Russia: Partnership Should </F>
Be For Sake of Peace, Not For Sake of Partnership"] 
  [Text] The sessions, held twice a year, of NATO's leading 
working organs -- the Military Committee and the Nuclear 
Planning Group -- have never minded about drawing journalists' 
attention. Both in the past, in the years of military 
confrontation between East and West, and now, when Europe and 
the world are in a strategically uncertain situation, these 
organs' decisions have had an enormous influence on the level of 
security on the continent. 
  It is hard to recall a representative of a nonmember country 
ever taking part in these sessions. This time, NATO ministers 
will be addressed by their Russian colleague Pavel Grachev. 
According to an opinion voiced during a special briefing at the 
U.S. Defense Department, the Russian Federation defense 
minister's speech is of enormous interest to NATO ministers. 
  And that interest is pragmatic rather than idle. NATO 
believes that a clearer understanding of Russia's 
military-political goals and priorities will make it possible to 
overcome a not very pleasant state of uncertainty. This 
uncertainty has arisen because all of a sudden Moscow sharply 
put the brakes on its accession to NATO's "Partnership for 
Peace" program. And it provided an excuse for people to talk 
about a kind of Russian haughtiness toward those states which 
had already joined the program. 
  Yet somehow what is being lost sight of is the fact that the 
"Partnership" program itself is only just being set up. The 
idea of a "partnership" open to all was a compromise in a 
difficult situation for NATO. When, on the one hand, a number 
of East European states stated their willingness to immediately 
join NATO on the pretext of the "threat from the East." And, on 
the other, Moscow resolutely opposed this prospect, rightly 
seeing it as a selfish attempt to revive military confrontation 
in Europe. The idea was then transformed into a collection of 
the most general principles. 
  Essentially "Partnership for Peace" is now just a way to 
ease 
the European states' mutual fears until such time as it is 
possible to elaborate an integrated and universally acceptable 
approach to safeguarding security on the European Continent. 
And this search does not end with the "Partnership" program. 
We need only mention the French plan for stability in Europe, 
and the proposal from the FRG and the Netherlands to strengthen 
the CSCE's peacekeeping role. Finally, we cannot fail to recall 
the Russian idea of galvanizing the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council as the core of a future security structure. 
  But, in parallel with this quest, there has been in recent 
months a rush by some 20 East European countries and former 
Soviet republics to join the "Partnership." And their joining 
looks like more of a symbolic act. 
  Russia has already recovered from its desire to collect the 
mere symbols of unity with the West. It now wants serious work 
in the sphere of strengthening pan-European stability. That is 
why the Russian Federation defense minister insists that setting 
out the provisions of the Russian military doctrine is of even 
greater importance than presenting to NATO the parameters and 
directions devised in Moscow for political and military 
cooperation with this organization. After all, in this context 
these parameters will no longer look like claims for a special 
status of relationship with NATO. This status should simply 
correspond in the most natural way to the status of a nuclear 
power responsible for the verification and nonproliferation 
regimes, and to Russia's approaches toward safeguarding its own 
and the world's security. 
  It seems as though NATO has not yet reached a general 
decision about just how to deal with the Russian approach. It 
is constantly reiterating that partnership, as U.S. Ambassador 
to Russia Pickering aptly put it, is a kind of "smorgasbord" 
open to everyone. Everyone can take the dish they want. In 
other words, each state determines the parameters of cooperation 
itself. But, after all, somebody has to act as the cook, 
supplying certain dishes and monitoring their quality.... 
  A Pentagon spokesmen stated that Russia's special role could 
be marked by a special statement or declaration. The FRG 
defense minister considers it realistic for Russia to take part 
in the NATO Council decisionmaking process, primarily when it is 
a question of pan-European security and global strategic issues. 
At the same time, NATO is insisting that Russia should not have 
the right of veto or any other additional privileges. But the 
main privilege on which Moscow is insisting is a partnership 
with NATO for the sake of peace, not just for the sake of 
partnership.

  [Text] Russia's partnership with NATO is a thing of reality 
despite much propaganda noise about it, the Foreign Minister's 
political adviser Galina Sidorova told Russian reporters in 
Moscow on Monday. 
  She said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's visit to 
missile carrying cruiser Admiral Nakhimov at Severomorsk on 
Monday must be seen as one more gesture towards partnership. 
  Sidorova described the Russian-British partnership to this 
end as being significant in a sense. "We have no differences, 
let alone, slightest misunderstanding with Britons. This is 
also indicated by Britain's position on Russia's cooperation 
with the G-7 countries and the Bosnian conflict as well as 
identical approaches to key international issues the two 
countries share", she said. 
  On Sunday's talks in Murmansk between the heads of the 
Russian and British foreign political departments, Sidorova made 
it clear that Britain was keen to see peaceful developments both 
in Crimea and Ukraine. "Britain appears to proceed from the 
principle of not doing harm", she said.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin article: "Thirty-Three Pages of Arguments </F>
`In Favor.' It Is Russia which Needs `Partnership for Peace' 
Most of All, Scientists Believe"] 
  [Text] Scientists from the Russian Center for Problems of 
National Security and International Relations headed by 
Professor, Doctor of Historical Sciences Sergey Rogov have 
prepared a 33-page report entitled "Partnership for Peace and 
Russia's Interests." In it they analyzed the political, 
military-economic, and military-technical aspects of the NATO 
program and made recommendations on the possible terms of our 
country's affiliation to this document. 
  The independent scientists' main conclusion is this: 
Russia's long-term geopolitical interests demand the country's 
immediate entry into talks with the NATO countries for the 
purpose of affiliation to that program. In this regard 
"Partnership for Peace" must unfailingly take into account 
Russia's special status and role in Europe and the world and its 
broad potential for influencing the course of political 
processes and ensure the strict observance of its national 
interests. 
  What arguments do the authors of the report present? They 
assert that the problem of Russia's participation in 
"Partnership for Peace" is primarily a question of defining our 
state's place in the new system of international relations which 
has developed since the end of the Cold War. Its present 
position can hardly be called satisfactory. We have no reliable 
allies and partners today. Russia has an urgent need for 
integration into the world market as a great power and not as a 
"poor relation" or a source of cheap raw materials and labor. 
  Of course, the scientists say, to be on a par with the other 
centers of power in the world arena we must fully implement our 
reforms and realize the country's vast economic potential. Only 
then will people really take notice of us. 
  Nor can we forget the foreign policy priorities. Russia, 
like any other state, has its own legitimate interests. They 
have nothing to do with imperial ambitions or superpower 
pretensions but the country's security, that is to say, its 
survival and development as a prosperous democratic state, 
demands that world political questions that affect us should not 
be resolved at the Russian Federation's expense. 
  The logic of passively waiting for things to happen and of 
deliberate "nonintervention" must be alien to us, the scientists 
say. On the contrary, it is only Russia's active participation 
in the "Partnership for Peace" program which will offer it the 
opportunity of exerting practical influence on the architecture 
of the future system of European security and of playing a major 
role worthy of a great country in it on an equal footing. There 
is no alternative here, the scientists argue, and ambiguity 
cannot be allowed. Either the Russian and Western military and 
politicians cooperate or else a flawed system of suspicion and 
hostility will sooner or later prevail. We already know what 
that leads to. 
  Undoubtedly if you analyze the documents forming the basis 
of 
"Partnership for Peace" you can say that it contains ideological 
postulates which are of a declarative nature. A precise 
mechanism for maintaining pan-European equilibrium has not been 
elaborated or approved yet but nevertheless the values which 
they proclaim do correspond to our country's long-term 
geopolitical interests. 
  Furthermore, in the scientists' opinion, NATO's new 
strategic concept does not conflict with our country's 
interests. It is based on the principles of ensuring the 
strictly defensive character of that alliance by reducing the 
levels of those forces maintained in a high state of combat 
readiness and major groupings, and on focusing efforts on the 
prevention of war and on the settlement of crises by peaceful 
means. 
  We are also pleased that NATO has embarked on the sharp 
reduction of military spending and the numerical strength of its 
armed forces. By 1997 their number in Central Europe will be 
down by 50 percent and their naval forces will be reduced by 10 
percent. In the scientists' opinion, there is no real 
foundation to the current opinion that our participation in the 
program will place an intolerable burden on the Russian economy 
and will destroy its defense industry once and for all as a 
result of the "standardization of arms and military hardware" 
which is mentioned in the document. 
  Within NATO itself such attempts have been made a number of 
times but have met with extremely modest success. Each state 
which has joined it has staunchly defended the interests of its 
own military industry. That is why the French are still flying 
Mirages, the Americans their F-15s and F-18s, the Italians their 
Tornadoes, and the Germans, among other things, the MiG-29. In 
addition, everyone understands that it is effectively impossible 
to resolve the rearmament problem in the foreseeable future -- 
it will cost too much money. 
  But giving the various countries' armed forces the potential 
to operate jointly and creating a unified command and control 
system for them, including computerized command and control, is 
a different matter. At the technical level, this presupposes 
first of all the unification of certain radio frequencies and 
the upgrading of receiving and transmitting equipment and, at 
the level of organization and training, it means the elaboration 
of a broad program to teach personnel a common language and a 
single understanding of military commands and terms. All these 
things are already happening when joint peacemaking operations 
are carried out. 
  The terms of "Partnership for Peace", the scientists 
believe, 
are in fact just the outer shell which still has to be filled 
with actual content. This may also depend on the joint work of 
specialists from Russia and the NATO countries. No initiative 
should be dismissed out of hand if we do not want to miss the 
boat which will leave for the future without us. 
  What are the conditions and principles of affiliation to the 
"Partnership for Peace" program that the scientists of the 
Center for Problems of Russia's National Security consider 
acceptable for Russia? 
  The first is that our country's entry into "Partnership for 
Peace" will mean the practical embodiment of the long-term 
Russian strategy aimed at moving from military-political 
confrontation with the West to strategic partnership with it in 
the military-political sphere. In this regard Russia must be 
guided by its own national interests without claiming any 
privileges but without waiving the legitimate right to equal 
security either. 
  Russia's paramount, priority goal in this program is the 
prevention of a new split of Europe, the arms race, and military 
confrontation, this time on our western borders -- around 
Smolensk and Bryansk. It is only by being part of this program 
that Russia will be able to influence the creation of an 
all-European collective security system and prevent the rapid 
expansion of NATO by means of former Warsaw Pact members. 
  At the same time, it is necessary to clearly determine what 
commitments Russia and the NATO countries will undertake toward 
one another. There can be no disagreements or ambiguities here. 
Our state is ready to accept the same degree of responsibility 
which the NATO members accept toward it. In the process it 
expects firm guarantees that if there is a threat to its 
national interests, Russia can count on the full support of its 
partners. "Partnership" will not hinder the development of close 
ties between our country and its Asian neighbors, first and 
foremost with China. 
  Russia cannot accept the idea that the crucial questions of 
international security are resolved without its participation 
and especially at its expense. Consequently, NATO, of which it 
is not a member, must not try to assume the role of an arbiter 
of other people's destinies. It is absolutely clear that the 
present mechanism of decisionmaking in NATO is inadequate here. 
Different, more democratic and mutually acceptable forms are 
needed, within the CSCE framework, for instance. 
  It is also necessary to define the specific forms of 
peacemaking cooperation within the "Partnership" framework. 
Russia is ready to take part in it under the auspices of the 
United Nations or the CSCE and also the CIS. But the kind of 
solution in which NATO is its initiator and we merely the mute 
executant does not befit to our country. Unilateral steps are 
unacceptable here. If all the members of the bloc and the other 
European states accept such an approach, world peace will be 
reliably ensured. 
  One of the conditions which our scientists envisage for 
Russia's affiliation to the new NATO program is the 
harmonization of Western and Russian standards in the production 
of arms and combat hardware. Not only must access to the 
traditional markets of Central and Eastern Europe not be barred 
to our weapons makers but access to the internal markets of NATO 
and other countries must also be opened up. Only then will 
partnership be real and not merely rhetorical. 
  The political games surrounding our country's affiliation to 
the the process of creating the new Europe, the unpredictable 
vacillation, and especially the delay in stating its firm 
position with regard to the "Partnership" program and the 
signing of the necessary documents, the scientists believe, 
could leave us in an impasse from which we will not be able to 
escape.

Tamara Zamyatina, Vladimir Beskoromnyy, Aleksandr Mineyev, and 
Vladimir Tenin under the "Topic of the Day" rubric: "Will 
Moscow Become NATO's Partner? The West Considers that the 
Security System Is Impaired without Russia, but Is in No Hurry 
To Grant It Special Status"] 
  [Text] On 24 May Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev will deliver a report to the session of North Atlantic 
bloc defense ministers in Brussels on Russia's terms for signing 
the Partnership for Peace program. According to the Russian 
mass media, the report was prepared jointly by the Defense and 
Foreign Ministries and amounts in essence to the demand that 
Russia be granted a special status within the program 
demarcating its position and role from that of the other 
participants, particularly the former Soviet republics. 
  According to reports coming in from Brussels, the NATO 
leadership is inclining toward meeting Moscow's requests and 
even toward signing a special agreement with it which would 
provide for holding additional consultations on problems of 
European security but only after Russia's signing the 
Partnership for Peace program, to the text of which the West 
categorically refuses to make changes. 
  As we succeeded in elucidating, the leadership of this 
Western military-political bloc is afraid that if it meets 
Moscow halfway in all its demands a situation could develop on 
the spur of the moment whereby Russia would achieve for itself 
the right to veto NATO military-political decisions and would 
thereby be able not only to block the activity of this 
organization but also to exercise control over it 
[kontrolirovat] which, after the breakup of the USSR and the 
ending of the Cold War, the NATO leadership could not even have 
envisaged in their wildest dreams. By all accounds, a quite 
tough reception awaits Pavel Grachev in Brussels. 
  Will Russia join the North Atlantic bloc one way or another 
or not? -- swords are going to be crossed on this score for a 
good while yet both in the West and in our own country. And 
although limited membership -- via the Partnership for Peace 
program, drafted by the United States -- rather than full 
membership is involved, it is obvious that this step could be 
the prologue to another drastic redrawing of the geopolitical 
map of the world in the 20th Century. What are the basic pros 
and cons, and who stands to gain? 
  Let us remember that the Partnership for Peace program 
appeared after Moscow's demarche opposing the immediate 
admission of East European and Baltic countries to NATO and that 
it is a kind of transitional stage toward full membership. 
  It has to be acknowledged that the program has been to the 
liking of many people. The framework agreement on affiliation 
to the Partnership program has already been signed at NATO HQ in 
Brussels by the top officials or foreign ministers of 18 
countries (among which number eight former Soviet republics), 
including Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Estonia, Hungary, Ukraine, 
and Slovakia. 
  The Partnership was conceived as preparation for carrying 
out joint peacemaking operations under UN and CSCE auspices, as 
a means of improving operational coordination. 
  In the opinion of a high-ranking representative of the NATO 
military planning committee interviewed by us, some partners, 
particularly in Russia, do not altogether grasp the meaning of 
operational coordination. The opinion is current that this 
means replacing military equipment and purchasing armaments from 
NATO countries. That is not so, he maintained. The capability 
for operational coordination implies common doctrines, common 
procedures, and, of course, the possibility of maintaining 
liaison with one another, maintaining contact. It does not mean 
major expenditure, large-scale conversion of the defense 
industry, or its switch from producing Soviet weapons to the 
manufacture of NATO-type equipment. 
  According to our observations, NATO is certain that Russia 
will sign the framework document. First, they think that Russia 
would otherwise remain on the sidelines in self-isolation. 
Second, the Partnership differs from participation in the 
present consultative North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC] 
by virtue of its individualized approach, and Russia wants to 
develop relations with NATO precisely on an individual basis. 
  At the same time Russia's nonaffiliation would, it is 
thought 
in Brussels, have undesirable political repercussions. 
  As far as Russian statements about its intention to have 
special status within the Partnership are concerned, NATO HQ 
makes clear that the program embodies the principle of equality 
and identical opportunities and that NATO will not agree to any 
amendments or additions to the framework document. But it is 
recognized here that it is in the general interests of NATO and 
the countries of Central and East Europe and in the interests of 
European security to take Russia's weight and significance into 
account. If NATO accepts any proposals by Russia that go beyond 
the Partnership program they will be the subject of separate 
agreements. 
  NATO Allied Command Europe received a delegation of Russian 
journalists and political scientists on 17 May. During 
discussion it became clear that while Russian political circles 
pay paramount attention to the military aspect of the program, 
its initiators pay equal attention to joint rescue and and 
humanitarian operations. However, their conduct has been 
hampered without the affiliation of Russia and CIS countries to 
the Partnership. 
  Asked whether NATO leaders don't see contradictions between 
the interests of Russia as a Eurasian power in its simultaneous 
participation in the CIS defense union [oboronyy soyuz] and the 
NATO program, the military replied that "in that event there 
will be complementarity of interests and the idea of a 
transcontinental community stretching from Vancouver to 
Vladivostok will be realized." Global security in Eurasia will 
thereby be guaranteed, in their opinion. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry's standpoint was expounded by 
senior adviser Andrey Androsov: "The program has concentrated 
within itself, as it were, the potential for collaboration which 
has emerged since the demise of the bipolar world. It takes 
account of our main thesis that NATO should not be enlarged by 
the mechanical admission of new states." 
  Foreign Ministry experts consider that the Russian 
Federation's nonaffiliation to Partnership for Peace will do 
great harm to the interests of Russia itself and that 
nonparticipation in the Partnership threatens seriously to 
isolate Russia in the international arena and reduce its scope 
for influencing the process of shaping a new Euro-Atlantic area. 
  And Aleksandr Piskunov, deputy chairman of the State Duma 
Defense Committee, considers that the Partnership program is an 
attempt to find a new raison d'etre for NATO while moving, 
albeit in veiled form, toward confrontation with Russia. With 
its affiliation to the program Russia forsakes the opportunity 
effectively to influence the CIS and destroys the treaty on 
collective security among Commonwealth countries.

Between a War of Rumors and a War of Nerves. The Ukrainian 
Prime Minister Has Arrived in Moscow, and a Delegation of 
Simferopol Parliamentarians, in Kiev"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The thesis that a Crimean war 
would benefit all three sides has become so commonplace that is 
no longer a subject of discussion. Everybody wants it. 
Meanwhile "everybody" wants a war of nerves, not a real 
shooting conflict. It is hardly likely that war is sought by 
President Meshkov who has long been unable to find a common 
language with his former associates in the Russian Democratic 
Congress who now sit in parliament. Furthermore, Crimea's 
inexperienced president would immediately become hostage to the 
retired GRU [Main Intelligence Directorate] officers he 
befriended "incautiously" or such people as newly appointed 
Internal Affairs Minister General Kuznetov who in his time was 
piqued by the suggestion that he could fight with Russia but 
appeared quite capable of fighting Ukraine. 
  Neither is war not needed to Saburov, his Moscow team and 
generally all Muscovites who have arrived in Simferopol to take 
part in the reform and therefore in privatization: what kind of 
reform could there be now? When guns speak, banks are 
silent.... The Crimean parliament might want war as a 
collective body but each individual deputy in particular.... 
  The same in Kiev. One can talk about President Kravchuk's 
wish to aggravate the situation to the limit in order to cancel 
presidential elections, but if the limit is overstepped, 
Kravchuk will lose one of his main trumps: the image of a person 
who could keep Ukraine peaceful after its independence was 
proclaimed. The Ukrainian government could also lose a great 
deal in the event of a serious conflict: The Ukrainian political 
elite does not need a war. Just as, incidentally, the Russian 
elite: A conflict with Ukraine is not confrontation with 
Georgia or Moldova; it is hard to calculate not only all the 
possible military or economic consequences involved here but 
also the international reaction. 
  Russia and Ukraine in the event of such a conflict run the 
risk of losing their image as normal members of the 
international community. After all, whereas in a similar 
Serbo-Croat conflict in former Yugoslavia there were at least 
some, even if wild, historical justifications and explanations, 
here no one will be able to find any. Society itself will not 
understand or accept this war: Politicians will begin to be 
viewed simply as regular madmen. 
  This notwithstanding, it cannot but be recognized that the 
sides stand to gain greatly from a war of nerves, in the course 
of which it is possible to resolve some separate internal 
political tasks and demonstrate commitment to principle without 
an extensive expenditure of efforts or resources. It is only 
important that those involved in the high-level quarrel 
understand very well the limits of the boundary that they must 
not cross no matter what.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 24 May -- Russia firmly insists on a purely 
political settlement of the problems between Kiev and 
Simferopol. This was announced at today's briefing by Grigoriy 
Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry Information 
and Press Department. 
  The Russian diplomat stressed that differences between Kiev 
and Simferopol are "purely an internal affair of Ukraine." 
However, he said that some Ukrainian politicians are trying to 
put the blame for this on "external forces", unambiguously 
implying that they mean Russia. 
  "As for our position with regard to the sovereign Republic 
of 
Crimea, which is an integral part of Ukraine, this position has 
not changed and is well known to the Ukrainian leadership," the 
Foreign Minister spokesman said. "Like the Ukrainian side, we 
too are naturally concerned about possible tensions in 
Russo-Ukrainian relations over Crimea," he noted. "We agree 
that such CSCE principles of international law as territorial 
integrity and inviolability of existing borders should be 
observed universally. But no less important is respect for the 
sovereign will of the peoples' show of restraint and the need to 
rule out the use or the threat to use any strong-arm methods in 
solving political problems." 
  G. Karasin stressed that in the opinion of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, "the situation in Crimea is further proof that 
key questions of Russo-Ukrainian relations should be solved 
promptly." According to the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, 
it is these problems and not the situation in Crimea that are 
being discussed at the Russian-Ukrainian talks at the level of 
heads of governments, which began in Moscow yesterday and which 
are continuing today.

  [Text] Russia is concerned over the situation in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Russian president's Envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaliy Churkin told an Interfax correspondent today. 
  He announced that on Saturday Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey 
Kozyrev had sent a verbal message to the main participants in 
the recent Geneva meeting on Bosnia -- the U.S. state secretary, 
the British foreign secretary, the French and German foreign 
ministers. 
  According to Churkin, Kozyrev expressed his concern and 
urged 
his colleagues to resort to their influence on the parties, for 
instance, on the Bosnian government in order to achieve 
implementation of the Geneva Document forbidding the parties 
from launching any offensives. Neither should they try to 
resolve their problems by military actions, Churkin pointed out. 
  On the issue of the positions of the conflicting parties, 
Churkin said he would not appraise their conduct while 
hostilities were going on, though these were not wide-scale 
offensives. At the same time, a contact group continues its 
work. On Tuesday or Wednesday the group will meet the 
conflicting parties in order to discuss the territorial 
demarcation in Bosnia under the 49:51 proportion (as it had been 
decided in Geneva). 
  The Interfax correspondent asked Churkin, who has several 
times been to the zone of conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, what he 
could advise to politicians in Kiev and in Simferopol due to the 
deterioration of the situation around Crimea. "A `Yugoslav 
version' is the worst that could happen. It cannot be forgotten 
that human life is precious as a value in itself and when 
seizing political power over destroyed territories one will lose 
more than win," Churkin remarked.

  [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- The delegations of Russia and 
Ukraine are now meeting in Moscow to discuss the situation in

the Russian part of the fleet as two top priority issues. 
  Before the talks Chernomyrdin and Zvyahilskyy had a

  [Text] Moscow, 24 May -- "A successful solution to the 
matter of dividing the Black Sea Fleet will stabilize the 
situation in the Crimea in general." That is how Ukraine's 
Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvegilskiy described the subject 
matter of the talks between the heads of governments of Russia 
and Ukraine, now in their second day. The second stage of the 
talks began earlier this morning. 
  Yesterday Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his 
Ukrainian counterpart discussed the division of the Black Sea 
Fleet and its infrastructure, and the issue of separate bases 
for the national fleets. The talks began in a one-to-one format 
with the two delegations joining later. 
  The talks are proceeding in a confidential atmosphere, but 
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov told 
correspondents that the exchange of views is constructive and is 
being conducted "in a good working tone." 
  The sides make no secret of the fact that the grounds for 
the 
current stage of the talks on the division of the Black Sea 
Fleet is the exacerbation of the political situation in Crimea. 
This follows the Crimean Parliament's decision to restore the 
Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992 which, in the Kiev 
authorities' view, may pose a threat to political stability in 
the Ukraine and provoke tension in relations between Russian and 
Ukraine. 
  In Valeriy Shmarov's words, no settlement of the political 
situation in Crimea was discussed at the talks yesterday. 
  Crimea's Vice Premier Yevgeniy Saburov today joined the 
Ukrainian delegation at the talks.

  [Text] Wunsdorf May 23 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev arrived in Wunsdorf on Monday where he will visit 
the headquarters of Russian Western troops which are being 
withdrawn from Germany. 
  Commenting on the situation on the Crimean peninsula, 
Grachev 
told journalists that although hazardous developments in the 
Crimea are Ukraine's internal affair, the situation on the 
peninsula is extremely complex and the political turmoil is 
becoming worse. At the same time, Grachev expressed the hope 
that the developments in the Crimea will not turn into major and 
serious conflicts. 
  In Wunsdorf, the Russian defence minister will meet 
commanders of Russia Western troops and later in Berlin, will 
have talks with representatives of the Deutsche Bank to discuss 
financial aspects of the troops' withdrawal. 
  Grachev attaches great importance to his talks with German 
financiers since this credit and financial organisation 
successfully cooperates with Russia in terms of financing the 
troops' withdrawal. According to Grachev, there are no problems 
in this respect. Besides, he intends to discuss with German 
bankers problems of the final stage of the troops pullout and 
outline prospects for further cooperation, including in the 
field of training Russian specialists who will work in 
structures of the Armed Forces in line of the banking business. 
  On Tuesday, the Russian defence minister will fly to 
Brussels. On Tuesday evening he expected to make a report to 
NATO commanders and heads of defence departments of NATO 
member-states, outlining basic principles of the Russian 
military doctrine. 
  On May 25, Grachev will have a series of bilateral talks 
with 
NATO defence ministers, and in particular, with the U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry. Grachev will take part in a joint 
session of defence ministers of NATO member-states to discuss 
problems of ensuring European security and prospects for NATO's 
cooperation with countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the 
CIS in military and political fields. During the session 
Grachev is expected to outline Russia's stance on the 
Partnership for Peace Programme. 
  "Russia has thoroughly prepared for this session," Grachev 
told journalists on Monday. He pointed out that Russia's 
position on the matter had been fully approved by President 
Boris Yeltsin and coordinated with the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  On board the plane carrying Grachev to Brussels there will 
be 
defence ministers of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, 
Belarus, Armenia and Georgia who had been given an opportunity 
to fly to Brussels on board the Russian plane. During the 
flight to Wunsdorf Grachev had no contacts with his CIS 
counterparts and was reported to have been studying documents. 
However, it is not ruled out that he will have such contacts in 
Brussels. 
  Upon completion of the NATO part of the programme, Grachev 
will begin an official two-day visit to Brussels on May 26 
during which he will meet the Belgian defence minister and 
familiarize himself with every-day life of Belgian servicemen.

  [Text] Wuensdorf, 23 May -- Although the present alarming 
events in Crimea are a domestic affair for Ukraine, it is 
obvious that the situation on the peninsula is very complex and 
passions are rising, first and foremost in the political sphere, 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev believes. At the same 
time, he expresses the hope that "the problem there will not 
develop into a serious, major conflict." 
  The Russian defense minister said this to correspondents 
today when he arrived in Wuensdorf, the headquarters of the 
Western Group of Forces [WGF], which is being withdrawn from 
Germany. 
  He will have a meeting here with the WGF command, and in 
Berlin he will hold talks with Deutsche Bank representatives 
about financing the withdrawal of the Russian forces. Pavel 
Grachev described his upcoming meeting with the Deutsche Bank 
management as "very important," since this credit finance 
institution has been cooperating very successfully with Russia 
over the question of finance for the troop withdrawal. He said 
that no problems have arisen in this respect. 
  Furthermore, he will also discuss the final stage of the 
withdrawal with the German bankers, and map out prospects for 
cooperation, including the training of specialists from Russia, 
who will work on banking matters within the armed forces.

  [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- "Only irresponsible 
politicians in Ukraine who are seeking to take advantage of the 
situation in the region in order to postpone presidential 
elections and retain power may benefit from creating tension in 
the Crimea," the Russian president's administration chief of 
staff Sergey Filatov said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Filatov said that 
transparent borders would provide the best conditions for 
relations not only between Ukraine, the Crimea and Russia, but 
also all CIS states. He regretted that unlike the rest of 
Europe, CIS countries are moving in the opposite direction, but 
only to realise with time that they will not be able to do 
without integration. 
  "The willingness of some Ukrainian politicians to fence off 
from Russia is conducive to the worsening of the social and 
psychological climate in society," Filatov said.

  [Text] "Kiev's demand for annulling the Crimean 
parliament's decision to restore the 1992 Constitution will 
hardly solve the problem. It will only aggravate it. The best 
thing would be to settle this conflict during talks between 
delegations of the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments," a 
high-ranking Russian diplomat in charge of relations with 
Ukraine told INTERFAX. 
  He believes that confrontation between Kiev and Simferopol 
will play into the hands of the Ukrainian politicians who seek 
momentary gains. 
  He is convinced that only a democratic procedure based on 
the 
CSCE principles will lead the conflict out of the deadlock. 
"International relations must be based on what the peoples 
consider correct and reasonable," he said. 
  President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov stated that Crimea did not 
doubt either Ukraine's territorial integrity, or the current 
borders. 
  The Russian diplomat is convinced that the situation in 
Crimea and in many other places of the former Soviet Union might 
be eased by the introduction of dual citizenship in Ukraine. 
"This is a vitally important issue. The Crimean residents I 
have talked with assert that free choice of citizenship for 
reasons of family circumstances would demonstrate Kiev's 
sincerity and inspire hope for a better future," he said. 
  To quote the Russian diplomat, he would not like to speak or 
think about "the worst variant" that might happen. "It's simply 
awful and inadmissible. It would be madness," he said. 
  He also expressed hope that Kiev would not go beyond the 
limits of common sense and stick to political methods.

<F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Irina Bolshova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- In 1993 China became Russia's 
second important trade partner (after the Federal Republic of 
Germany) with the volume of trade turnover of about 7.7 billion 
U.S. dollars, Oleg Davydov, Russian minister of foreign economic 
ties, told BUSINESS-TASS today in connection with the 
forthcoming visit to China of the an official delegation of the 
Russian Federation headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  It is necessary to resolve a number of problems for the 
further mutually beneficial development of bilateral economic 
ties, Oleg Davydov believes. 25-30 per cent of contracts remain 
unimplemented due to the absence of the real possibilities of 
cargo transportation. Therefore, this makes it necessary to 
widen traffic capacities of the existing border crossing points 
and open new ones, intensify the use of transit directions 
through Mongolia and Kazakhstan, establish joint transport and 
construction companies and introduce more actively container 
transportation. 
  Both countries are also confronted with an acute problem of 
insuring the safety of goods, particularly on the Russian 
territory, the minister noted. 
  Oleg Davydov also regards as a more and more pressing need 
to 
partly reconsider the terms of payments under the inter- 
governmental agreement on economic and technical cooperation in 
the construction and reconstruction of industrial objects in 
China signed on July 10, 1985. According to Oleg Davydov, the 
currency clearing system of payments under this agreement has 
lost its advantages and practically has come to inter-state 
barter transactions. 
  It is also necessary to take into account changes in the 
internal economic situation in Russia, specifically the complex 
financial condition of many Russian plants-suppliers which makes 
them raise the question of the need to change over to a hard 
currency in payments for complete equipment delivered to China. 
  The minister believes that as both countries are short of 
hard currency it is expedient to reach agreements between their 
central banks on the partial use of national currencies in 
payments for trade operations outside the framework of 
inter-state trade. 
  The further development of trade and economic ties between 
the Russian Federation and China will be impossible without 
strengthening and improving their contractual and legal base. 
The top priority task in this field must be the signing of 
inter- government documents on the protection of the rights of 
intellectual property and on avoiding of double taxation, the 
Russian minister noted. 
  It is also probable that in connection with the possibility 
of both countries joining the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade (GATT) in the future it will be necessary to review some 
provisions of bilateral treaties in accordance with GATT 
requirements.

  [Text] Beijing May 24 TASS -- "The present difficulties in 
Sino-Russian relations are temporary, of course," Geng Xuncai, a 
representative from the Chinese Ministry for Foreign Trade and 
Foreign Economic Cooperation, said in an interview with 
ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
  The high-ranking official pins great hopes for their 
solution 
on the second meeting of the bilateral intergovernment 
commission on trade, economic, scientific and technical 
cooperation, which will open here on Wednesday, on the eve of 
the visit by Russian Premier Viktor Chrnomyrdin to China. 
  Its participants led by Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr 
Shokhin who will come to Beijing on Wednesday, and Chinese 
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing will discuss prospects for transition to 
new forms of trade and methods of regulating border trade 
turnover and cooperation in agriculture and the transfer of 
technologies. 
  "The two partners should advance major companies to forward 
positions in trade and investment," Geng claimed. This is 
necessary to avoid barter which is responsible for 65 per cent 
of Chinese- Russian trade turnover up to this time as well as to 
escape a drop in bilateral trade relations which took place in 
the first quarter, he added. 
  According to Geng, China is interested in establishing full- 
fledged business realations in such priority areas as the 
aerospace industry, chemistry, machine-building and 
pharmaceutics. 
  Experts will also concentrate on the transport problem 
containing the growth of Russian-Chinese trade relations. 
  Russian enterprises have good prospects for participating in 
the construction of a mammoth hydropower development, "Sanxia", 
on the Jangtze River, which is called here "the most spectacular 
project after the Great Chinese Wall". 
  Russian trade representative in China Aleksandr Kachanov is 
also optimistic about prospects for cooperation. "The order book 
of Russian enterprises for the delivery of complete plant to 
China up to the year 2000 is worth 1.4 billion U.S. dollars for 
signed contracts alone," he said in an exclusive interview with 
ITAR-TASS later in the day. 
  Russia is among leading suppliers of machinery to the 
Chinese 
market. It helps to retool several industrial enterprises, 
including major fuelled power plants and participates in 
designing a nuclear power station with a capacity of two million 
kw in the Liaoning Province. 
  "It is self-evident that support from state bodies of the 
two 
countries is necessary to realise the potential of our 
relations. We pin great hopes on the meeting of the 
intergovernment commission," Kachanov stressed. 
  Many Chinese businessmen engaged in operations with Russian 
partners have got reasons to review their calcualtions and 
plans. President Boris Yeltsin's decree on repealing quotas on 
and licencing of exports, the text of which has just been 
circulated by the XINHUA news agency, makes a new ten-billion 
barrier in bilateral trade turnover possible.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Mukomolov: "You Won't Fool Around </F>
Under the Interpol Cap"] 
  [Text] In April in Moscow in a private apartment in the 
region of the "Bibirevo" subway station staffers of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service directorate for Moscow City and 
Moscow Oblast arrested PRC citizen Lin Chiyu, a 27-year-old from 
Beijing of Han nationality, a former judo practitioner and 
unemployed. Following an application from the Chinese side he 
had been sought by Interpol for crimes on the Beijing-Moscow 
international train. 
  No one right now can cite the exact number of Chinese living 
in the Moscow region. According to very approximate figures in 
1992 there were 40,000 of them, now there are 150,000. But the 
fact that there are many of them and that most are living in 
Moscow and Moscow Oblast under false documents and far-feteched 
pretexts is a fact. 
  The "Alex International," "Tampos," "Orient Express," 
"Dzhuntan," "Sovindep," "Stamp," "People's Capital," "Min Sin 
Limited," and "Voyager" companies are rendering PRC citizens 
active assistance (not for free, of course) in penetrating 
Russian territory. Thus, in the period from April through 
October 1993 alone the "Voyager" commercial services company 
arranged 1,520 visas for PRC citizens. 
  Stable Chinese criminal communities have formed on the 
territory of the Moscow region -- the "Beijing," "Harbin," and 
"Fujian" groupings -- to send their fellow citizens via Russia 
to the countries of West and East Europe. The profitable 
underground business has been joined by the criminal structures 
of China, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. They have set up ties in 
Russia and European countries with criminal formations which 
trade in fake visas and passports. The cost of sending one 
person is $5,000-15,000 so this business is guaranteed to 
flourish. 
  Tens of thousands of Chinese whose fate depends on 
recruiters, suppliers, shippers, escorts, the producers of fake 
documents, and the owners of doss-houses have complicated the 
crime situation in the capital and oblast. Without the means of 
existence many have been forced to engage in smuggling, the 
drugs business, and prostitution, often themselves becoming the 
victims of crime. 
  Over the past year alone 138 crimes were committed against 
Chinese, including five murders, 50 muggings, and 33 robberies, 
while seven crimes were committed by PRC citizens. Actually 
this figure scarcely reflects the true state of affairs since 
the Chinese community is characterized by a wall of silence, the 
absence of those willing to complain, and fear of reprisal. 
  During the operational investigation measures the capital's 
Federal Counterintelligence Service directorate managed to close 
several channels for the illegal immigration of Chinese to the 
West. Weapons, fake passports and seals and stamps of PRC 
embassies, consulates, and state institutions and notaries' 
offices, blank forms, documents of authorization, visas, and 
other items relating to illegal activity were confiscated. 
  Since the signing in 1992 of the agreement on cooperation 
between the Russian Ministry of Security and the Chinese 
Ministry of Public Security working contacts have been 
established with staffers of the PRC Embassy in Moscow and 
representatives of the Ministry of Public Security. 
  In December last year PRC citizens Yan Chunyou and Yu 
Haishun, arrested by Moscow counterintelligence staffers, were 
handed over to the Chinese side. These men had committed 
serious crimes in China and were being looked for. 
  But these are only the first steps. The main problems have 
not been eliminated. Numerous limited partnerships and 
commercial structures (over 1,200) engaged in the organization 
of tourist trips to our country and inviting people to work and 
study are sending out hundreds of thousands of new invitations. 
But no one is seriously monitoring the placement, stay, and 
departure of foreigners from the country. 
  Soon Lin Chiyu will be sent to Beijing under the escort of 
Chinese Ministry of Public Security staffers but where are the 
guarantees that on that same day tens of new adventure-seekers 
will not enter Russia?

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>
  [Text] Seoul May 23 TASS -- A recent proposal made by the 
Russian Government to convene an international conference on 
security and a nuclear-free status on the Korean Peninsula shows 
Russia's intention to promote the settlement of the problem, 
said President of South Korea Kim Yong-sam in an interview with 
Russian journalists accredited in Seoul. The president spoke in 
the run up to his visit to Moscow scheduled for June 1-4. 
  Moscow officials believe that in connection with North 
Korea's readiness to secede from the Nuclear Non-proliferation 
Treaty, the situation must be discussed at a multilateral 
conference with the participation of Russia, China, the United 
States, Japan, North Korea, South Korea and representatives from 
the United Nations and IAEA. Welcoming this proposal, the 
Korean president said that since at this stage and in connection 
with its nuclear aspect measures are being taken jointly by the 
United Nations and the IAEA, this proposal should be regarded 
taking into account possible developments of the situation and 
the position of other interested sides. "Probably, it will take 
some time to realise whether the conference suggested by Russia 
will be a means of the settlement of the problem," Kim Yong-sam 
said. 
  He pointed out that this problem is of great importance for 
peace on the Korean Peninsula, in the north-east Asia and in the 
whole world. He believes that Russia is abiding by a principle 
position, coming out against the creation of nuclear weapons in 
North Korea, and therefore, upcoming talks at a summit level in 
Moscow will make it possible to discuss ways of cooperation 
between Russia and South Korea in this direction. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS what message the South Korean president 
would like to give to his North Korean counterpart, taking 
advantage of this interview, Kim Yong-sam pointed out that if 
North Korea really wishes peace and unification on the Korean 
Peninsula, firstly, it should stop nuclear developments and 
secondly, begin an open dialogue with the south, rather than 
attempt to resolve Korean problems through the United States 
only. The termination of the nuclear programme would be both a 
means of survival for North Korea itself and a way of ensuring 
peace on the Korean Peninsula, Kim Yong-sam said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>
  [Text] Seoul May 23 TASS -- The upcoming Russo-South-Korean 
summit will primarily confirm the fact that constructive and 
mutually complementing relations of partnership already exist 
between our two countries, said South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam in an interview to Russian journalists accredited in 
Seoul. The South Korean president spoke in the run up to his 
official visit to Moscow scheduled on June 1-4. 
  He pointed out that thanks to summit talks "the sad past 
will 
remain in the past" and be replaced by a new epoch of friendship 
and cooperation. The two countries have become important 
partners in the process of mutual cooperation in various fields, 
including economy, culture and security. The president said 
that he believes that his forthcoming visit to Russia will 
enable to strengthen friendly relations between the two 
countries. 
  Russia plays an important role in South Korea's diplomacy, 
politics and security since strengthening ties between the two 
countries is necessary for security on the Korean Peninsula, 
where confrontation remains since the times of the Cold war, and 
for the creation of a basis for Korea's peaceful unification and 
ensuring peace in north-east Asia, the Korean president said. 
  He pointed out that for over 110 years since diplomatic 
relations were established in 1884 when a Russo-Korean trade 
agreement was signed, there have been many twists in bilateral 
relations, but for a short period of time, beginning from 1990, 
bilateral relations developed steadily both politically and 
economically. 
  Sharing common values, the two countries are going along the 
way of developing new relations of partnership, friendship and 
mutual assistance. The president expressed the hope that after 
his visit the relations between the two countries will become 
stronger. The president went on to say that for economic 
cooperation, South Korea and Russia should seek to rely on the 
principle of mutually complementing each other as much as 
possible. Kim Yong-sam pointed out that an efficient use of 
Russia's advanced technologies and natural resources and Korea's 
industrial technologies and economic experience will enable the 
two countries to strengthen their competitiveness on the 
international market. 
  The Korean president admitted that for various reasons South 
Korean businessmen had failed to penetrate into Russia on a 
large scale. However, he expressed the hope that his visit 
would promote the expansion of Korean investments into Russia, 
and in particular, in Russia's Far Eastern regions. 
  Bilateral trade between Russia and South Korea has been 
steadily on the rise since 1992, and this year, the volume of 
bilateral trade is expected to reach 2 billion dollars, the 
Korean president said. He pointed out that during his meeting 
with Boris Yeltsin the two sides will discuss projects for 
further development of cooperation, including in such spheres as 
environmental protection and construction.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Federation" rubric: </F>
"Duma To `Check' Regional Constitutions. Deputies Mistrust 
Post-Soviet Laws"] 
  [Text] Today, the State Duma is scheduled to hold hearings 
on the consistency of the constitutions and charters of the 
Federation components with the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation. According to the hearings' sponsors -- members of 
the State Duma committee on the affairs of the federation and 
regional policy -- the presidents of Kalmykia, Tuva, and North 
Ossetia agreed to attend the hearings. The other regions will 
be represented by "the authors of local constitutions and 
charters." The staff of the Russian president will apparently 
be represented by Sergey Filatov, who "promised to come to open 
the hearings if he can." The sponsors have said that Sergey 
Shakhray, who, although removed from the post of minister for 
the affairs of nationalities and regional policy, evidently is 
not going to weaken his contacts with the regional leaders, also 
plans to be present at the hearings. Federation Council Speaker 
Vladimir Shumeyko will not attend because he is currently in 
Latin America, so the Senate will be represented by his deputy, 
Ramazan Abdulatipov. 
  Aleksandr Arinin, member of the Federation Committee, said 
that "the Treaty on Social Accord is designed to speed up the 
process of bringing regional constitutions in line with the 
federal one." A total of 17 out of 21 republics that are part 
of the Russian Federation have their own constitutions. 
According to Mr. Arinin, territorial constitutions "can be 
divided into three types:" old constitutions of Soviet 
socialist republics (in Mordovia, Chuvashia, Udmurtia, Mari-El, 
Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia, and Dagestan); new 
constitutions adopted before 12 December 1993 (Tatarstan, 
Sakha-Yakutia, Chechnya, and Tuva); and constitutions adopted 
after the new Russian Fundamental Law went into force 
(Bashkortostan, Buryatia, Ingushetia, Komi, and Karelia). 
  Activists of the State Duma committee have told your 
SEGODNYA 
correspondent that, in their view, "republican constitutions 
adopted after 1992 are most inconsistent with the Russian 
Fundamental Law." As for the "Soviet-type" constitutions, Deputy 
Valentin Mikhaylov thinks, "they have minor deviations that can 
be eliminated fairly easily." 
  To all appearances, an entirely different view will be held 
by an expert commission of the Central Electoral Commission and 
the executive authorities, which has recently "studied the 
Mordovian Constitution as to its consistency." Even according 
to the experts' preliminary impressions, Mordovian laws are 
inconsistent with the new Russian Constitution precisely because 
"they effectively recreate the Soviet system." Duma deputies 
were not certain, however, that the commission's findings would 
be made public during the parliamentary hearings. 
  Interestingly, at yesterday's news conference State Duma 
Deputy Yegor Zhirkov, an author of the Sakha-Yakutia 
Constitution, protested against the Federation Committee 
members' using unlawful terms, such as "the violation of and 
inconsistency with the Russian Constitution," regarding his 
republic's fundamental law. "Our Constitution was checked by 
expert commissions from Moscow; in particular, Boris Topornin 
noted its full consistency with the fundamentals of the 
constitutional order," Deputy Zhirkov assured. 
  The committee members promised that they would insist on 
setting up "a joint commission on constitutional reform" to 
include representatives of executive and legislative authorities 
of the center and the regions so as "to devise a single approach 
to making on a contract basis possible changes to both regional 
constitutions and the new Russian Constitution." 
  However, the deputies themselves conceded that reaching "a 
common approach" would be nearly impossible even during today's 
hearings, because some influential State Duma factions think 
that republics may only be formed according to the territorial 
principle, while Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, for instance, even 
demands that all republics be reduced "to the level of 
governorates."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Rybkin is Top of the List"] </F>
  [Text] The Russian Center for Political Culture Studies 
has conducted a regular poll among experts asking them to rate 
on a 10-point scale the political influence of State Duma 
deputies this past April. The experts included parliamentary 
journalists of leading newspapers, radio and television and 
political scientists. 
  Their findings, wired in an INTERFAX report, indicate that 
Speaker Ivan Rybkin holds the lead just as in previous polls. 
While remaining uncontested leader, his April rating dropped to 
7.6 points from 8.2 in March. Political scientists put this 
down to the fact that a considerable number of his supporters 
demanded his resignation over his conciliatory stance on the 
president's version of the Treaty on Social Accord. 
  The runner-up is the Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov with 
6.2 points. The poll results indicate that he is becoming an 
increasingly weighty and acceptable political figure in the eyes 
of both presidential supporters and the opposition. G. Zyuganov 
was third in the March poll. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
leader, is back among the three top deputies (he scored 6 points 
in April up from 5.4 in March) after the Duma supported last 
month his suggestion that the internal affairs minister should 
quit over the killing of deputy Ayzderdzis, and after he 
negotiated his signing of the Treaty on Social Accord with the 
president's team. 
  The budget debate jacked up the rating of Sergey Glazyev 
(Democratic Party of Russia), chairman of the Duma Committee on 
Economic Policy, who published in April a draft program of the 
"Accord in the Name of Russia" opposition movement. He scored 
5.6 points. 
  Next comes Grigoriy Yavlinskiy (Yabloko) who managed to move 
in the April poll to fifth position from 17th in March. 
  Yegor Gaydar, "Russia's Choice" leader, dropped to sixth 
position from second in March over his weakened influence on the 
decision- making process in the State Duma. 
  Vladimir Isakov (Agrarian Party of Russia), Sergey Shakhray 
(Party of Russian Unity and Accord), Viktor Ilyukhin (Communist 
Party of the Russian Federation), and Aleksandr Vengerovskiy 
(Liberal Democratic Party of Russia) are in the upper part of 
the table as they have always been in the Center for Political 
Culture Studies polls.

  [Text] Moscow, 23 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Today in the Kremlin 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin held a meeting with 
representatives of the State Duma deputies' group 
"Liberal-Democratic Union of 12 December," a report by the 
Russian president's press service, circulated here today says. 
The participants in the conversation exchanged opinions on a 
number of topical issues in the country's political and economic 
life and State Duma activities. 
  Assessing the first results of the work of the lower chamber 
of the Russian Federal Assembly, Boris Yeltsin expressed concern 
about its insufficiently high effectiveness. Incidentally, the 
Russian president expressed confidence that the Duma will 
continue to raise the effectiveness of its activities. The 
Russian president stressed that for his part he firmly intends 
to continue the course toward constructive cooperation with the 
Federal Assembly. 
  During the meeting a great deal of attention was paid to a 
package of "economic" decrees signed by the Russian president 
today. Deputies from "the Union of 12 December" expressed their 
support for the measures they contain and that are aimed at the 
further development of economic reforms.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "Russia Will Have Its </F>
Counterintelligence Doctrine"] 
  [Text] It is expected that this Thursday [26 May] 
President Boris Yeltsin will sign the Fundamentals of Russia's 
Counterintelligence Doctrine. The setting for this will be a 
conference in the headquarters of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS] with Russian 
counterintelligence leaders. 
  Informed sources, in giving this information, noted that, in 
the event that the results of the conference require any 
modifications to this document, which has already been agreed in 
principle, the signing will be postponed. 
  Let us recall that the president visited Foreign 
Intelligence 
Service headquarters some weeks ago. However, no conceptual 
documents similar to those which have been prepared for the 
conference in the FCS and which would have defined Russia's 
[foreign] intelligence doctrine were elaborated for that 
meeting. At the same time, the sources stressed, in his speech 
to intelligence workers and in his more private talk with the 
Foreign Intelligence Service leadership, Boris Yeltsin posed a 
number of fundamental questions -- including on the subject of 
cadres -- the essence and details of which are not yet being 
made public, but which could also be interpreted as defining 
some of the key guidelines of a possible [foreign] intelligence 
doctrine. 
  The sources do not rule out that the counterintelligence 
doctrine, if it is signed by the president, will be made public, 
albeit with a number of cuts.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's decision to meet with Chechen President Dzhokhar 
Dudayev is based on his concern about the current situation in 
the republic which poses an "increased threat" to its population 
and residents of adjacent regions, including Daghestan and the 
Astrakhan region, Yeltsin's administration chief of staff Sergey 
Filatov said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Filatov said that 
the date of the meeting has yet to be set. 
  Observers believe that Yeltsin had been putting off the 
meeting with Dudayev, waiting for his old foe, former Russian 
parliament chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov to leave the Chechen 
Republic where he stayed after his release from prison under 
amnesty earlier this year. Now that Khasbulatov is in Moscow, 
the last obstacle has been removed.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yevgeniy Kiselev on interview with </F>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray; place and date of 
interview not given; from the "Itogi" newscast] 
  [Excerpts] [Begin recording] [Kiselev] So you did not know 
at all that a decision on your resignation was being prepared? 
  [Shakhray] I learned about the decision after it was made, 
and the same applies to the new minister. Formally, from the 
legal point of view, the decision is correct. But there is also 
such thing as official or human ethics. Therefore, my decision 
to resign was prompted not by emotions -- I had time to think it 
over -- but by the fact that ethical norms were violated. 
  [Kiselev] Are you under the impression that all this is kind 
of natural since people from the 1991 August-December period are 
now leaving the pinnacle of state power and the president is 
parting with those who featured at the beginning of his activity. 
  [Shakhray] You know, my feeling -- or observation, rather -- 
is that it is difficult for the president to part with people he 
has worked with for a long time. He finds this difficult as a 
person. Psychologically, this may show in the fact that after 
spending a long time trying to resolve a cadre issue, he makes a 
decision in a very sudden and resolute manner, as if tearing 
this problem away from him, so to speak, tearing it like one 
pulls a knot without untangling it. And then we have many 
examples when we usually say that a person who has been fired 
found out about his resignation... 
  [Kiselev, interrupting] Do you think that the president's 
decision not to accept your resignation, which was read by his 
press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, also proves the fact that 
a person finds it difficult to part with his colleagues. 
  [Shakhray] May be, may be. The other thing is that it should 
not have been announced by the esteemed Mr. Kostikov. I am not 
going to mention any personal assessments or lexicon which was 
used at the time but if it were up to Kostikov to decide, he 
would have accepted my resignation. [passage omitted] 
  [Kiselev] What are the real reasons for your resignation? 
Why is it that you were notified without any warning, that you 
were simply told that you were no longer the minister for the 
affairs of nationalities? 
  [Shakhray] If no motives or reasons are stated in the 
document releasing me from the post of minister, we can only 
learn them from either the prime minister or the president. 
Everything else is just our suppositions. The ministry has 
become a real tool in the management system. I'll tell you why. 
[words indistinct] the ministry has real means, power, and 
financial levers in its hands. For example, seven trillion 
rubles [R] for Russia's north will be handled by the ministry as 
well as R40 billion for Russia's Germans in accordance with 
intergovernmental agreements concluded between Russia and 
Germany, and R20 billion for the budget fund to support Russia's 
peoples which is, in essence, Russia's national policy of 
cultural revival of its peoples and which encompasses textbooks, 
languages, training of ethnic cadres, and so on. As soon as the 
ministry becomes a real institution, its ministers are replaced. 
It is obvious that those who are behind the decision believe 
that somebody else should operate the control levers. This is 
the financial reason of what happened. There are also purely 
political reasons, namely that the ministry is headed by the 
leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord. 
  I think this is the outcome of maneuvering which has been 
going on for many months. Not all of those drawn into these 
maneuvers even realize what has been going on. 
  [Kiselev] What is the origin of these maneuvers, as you put 
it, these intrigues if you like, which have been hatching for 
some time? Is it the presidential office or the Federation 
Council? Or do they originate here, within the Council of 
Ministers? 
  [Shakhray] Well, again, you and I can only conjecture and 
assume. I think that the prime minister demonstrated one of his 
characteristics. He does not like reshuffling ministries or 
governments which he is working with. He prefers to work with 
experienced people. So, this maneuvering does not originate 
with the government. I believe in the principle: Don't judge if 
you don't wish to be judged yourself. So I won't throw stones 
of accusation in any direction. I think that all those who have 
a stake in this maneuvering have drawn the spotlight on 
themselves without any help from others. [end recording] 
[passage omitted] 
  There are many hypotheses about the reasons for Shakhray's 
resignation. One which deserves special mention is the Chechen 
connection, the claim that Shakhray's departure is connected 
with serious disagreements within the Russian leadership about 
the problem of a settlement with Chechnya. When I asked 
Shakhray what lay behind these disagreements, he said: 
  [Begin Shakhray recording] I really feel uncomfortable even 
talking about this. Why? Because this is not the view of 
Shakhray, or the view of Shumeyko and Filatov, who allegedly 
represent a different point of view. The fact is that a formula 
for settling this conflict is contained in the president's 
message and in parliament's decision, that is, talks and 
consultations with the Chechen authorities and consultations 
with all political forces in Chechnya. The subject of these 
consultations must be a draft treaty on the delimitation of 
responsibilities and powers. Then the treaty must be signed 
after elections have been held -- in 1994 or 1995, though the 
date of the elections is not the issue. If esteemed Vladimir 
Filippovich or anybody else says that it will not be done that 
way, that we will solve the Chechen problem a different way, he 
will be changing the president's official line, changing the 
State Duma's official line. The entire logic of events is 
leading up to the following scenario: One of the Chechen 
leaders will normalize relations with Russia and do his people a 
favor and himself a favor as a political leader. 
  All the intrigue began because esteemed Ruslan Imranovich 
Khasbulatov arrived in Chechnya. His contacts with aides to 
Rutskoy and other politicians convince me that he will not sit 
idle there for long. He will behave as politicians do. He will 
enter the federal elections, if they are held there under, say, 
an outline agreement for normalization of relations between 
Chechnya and Russia. Then a completely different fate will 
await other politicians. 
  So, the personification of figures within the Chechen 
Republic, taken together with their previous incarnation on the 
Russian Mount Olympus, leads to what you call different 
approaches. These are not different approaches. I personally 
believe, all told, that the important factor from Russia's point 
of view is not personalities -- Shakhray, Ivanov, Sidorov, or 
somebody else. The important thing is to ensure that this 
tendency, political and economic normalization of relations as a 
whole, strengthening of Russia's unity and integrity, should 
make headway. [end recording] 
  Let us focus on three aspects of Sergey Shakhray's interview 
which vividly illustrate Russian politics. First, as soon as 
any state official gets his hands on real political -- and 
especially economic -- levers of power, he immediately becomes 
the target of fierce attack from other politicians -- not 
necessarily from within the camp of his hardline opponents, 
either. 
  Second, the interview shows quite clearly that on the 
Russian 
political Olympus there are figures who fear the prospect of 
Ruslan Khasbulatov's return to politics more than they fear the 
prospect of endless crisis in Russian-Chechen relations. 
  Last, in spite of everything, Shakhray displays in this 
interview maximum loyalty to the president -- and not just in 
the interview. He has, as it were, left the door open, saying 
that he will not make a final decision on whether to resign or 
not from the post of deputy prime minister until he has had 
talks with the president -- talks which will probably be held 
next week. However if, as he has said, Shakhray realizes as a 
result of these talks that it will be impossible for him to 
operate normally as deputy prime minister responsible, in 
particular, for ethnic and regional policy, his decision to 
resign will stand. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1625 GMT on 23 May carries a 15-minute "Details" 
program featuring Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia, LDPR. This "Details" edition is in 
response to criticism from the LDPR that the program's announcer 
Nikolay Svanidze, in a previously edition, said Zhirinovskiy 
allegedly paid 500 dollars to each member of the LDPR faction to 
get them to vote for the country's budget. 
  The program starts with a clip containing Svanidze's earlier 
comment on the Zhirinovskiy bribes, followed by a three-and-half 
minute introductory question by Svanidze to today's guest, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who chews his lips, shuffles papers, and 
tries to interrupt Svanidze's introduction several times. 
  Svanidze asks how much truth there is in various, sometimes 
outlandish, rumors circulating about Zhirinovskiy and his party, 
and why Zhirinovskiy is so upset at the suggestion of his 
bribing his deputies. To this Zhirinovskiy replies: 
  "Moscow courts are inundated with our cases about the 
defense 
of honor and dignity, my personal dignity, and that of the 
party. We keep on protesting. 
  "For the first time in six months you have given me an 
opportunity to speak here, and only after a measure by the 
entire faction, when we left the conference hall of the State 
Duma. In such situations some political figures or even mass 
media people would resign. The only thing that has happeened so 
far in our country is that you have finally graciously permitted 
the leader of a party with a big electoral victory, the leader 
of the largest party faction, to come here and explain himself 
in the light of your untruthful accusations. Ninety percent of 
what has been said about the party in the five months since our 
electoral victory is lies. Ten percent of those rumors are 
correct." 
  Zhirinovskiy goes on to criticize every level of government 
for not providing him and his party with appropriate offices in 
the center of Moscow, saying that even petty criminals have 
better accommodation than the LDPR. 
  He then goes on to reply to the second part of the 
introductory question regarding the alleged bribes, saying: 
  "Well then. No member of the party has received or will ever 
receive anything from me. You have said that I gave them 500 
dollars each. I would not have given even 500 rubles. I will 
never pay anyone, not even Moscow functionaries. You have told 
such a lie, such an despicable accusation, and not only against 
me. You said I paid them, and thus you have insulted the entire 
faction, the entire party. You spat in the face of almost 13 
million voters, who voted for us because we are the most honest 
group of deputies." 
  Zhirinovskiy goes on to repeat the same thing several times 
over, then shouts at Svanidze: 
  "You tell me, why is it that all the media, including 
Ostankino, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, the Moscow channel, and all the 
others, always slander the party? Why is it? We are depicted 
as fascists, ultra-right wing. Is any of it contained in the 
party program? You tell me, why is it that you lot, the TV 
journalists, slander not only me and my party but also the 
entire country?" 
  Svanidze replies that even if he wanted to, which is not the 
case, he never would have been able to spit in the face of 13 
million people. As for the media in general, he says 
Zhirinovskiy often is himself the cause of various rumors. 
  Svanidze then suggests Zhirinovskiy is trying to present his 
comment as an insult to the Duma, and then plays a clip in which 
Zhirinovskiy himself says the Duma has many corrupt deputies. 
To this Zhirinovskiy replies, shouting at times, that this is 
all true. According to him, the Central Electoral Commission 
has discovered that various democratic parties and groups have 
been supported by what Zhirinovskiy calls "Western intelligence 
services." He then accuses Svanidze, the media, and everyone in 
general of not having the guts to accept the fact that his party 
is the most popular one -- and the cheapest as well. 
  Svanidze replies: "Yes, I understand now that the only clean 
and cheap deputies, as you say, belong to the LDPR faction." He 
reminds Zhirinovskiy, quoting one of his own recent speeches, 
that he likes to deliberately deceive voters, especially women, 
peasants, and certain national minorities, for their own good. 
He then suggests the reason Zhirinovskiy is so upset about the 
accusation of bribery is simply because he is looking for a 
scandal, as scandals are much more amusing than the daily 
dreariness of the Duma, and at any rate, Zhirinovskiy is a 
natural when it comes to scandals. 
  Amid much shouting and arm-waving from both men, 
Zhirinovskiy 
replies that lying is simply an electoral tactic, that there is 
nothing wrong with it. The rest of his reply is lost in 
simultaneous shouting from both men and the program ends.

  [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- Russian ultra-nationalist 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy accused the Russia's Choice and Yabloko 
blocs of using foreign funds in their election campaign in 
December 1993. 
  Speaking on Russian television on Monday, Zhirinovskiy said 
Russia's Choice and the Yabloko Bloc received money from foreign 
organisations, claiming that he had obtained this information 
from a report of the Central Electoral Commission. 
  Zhirinovskiy also denied allegations by political analyst 
Nikolay Svanidze that he had allegedly paid the members of his 
party faction in the State Duma 500 U.S. dollars each to support 
the federal budget. "None of the members of our faction has 
ever received any payment and never will," Zhirinovskiy said. 
Svanidze did not provide any proof. 
  Zhirinovskiy said his Liberal Democratic Party of Russia is 
"the most honest" party and members of its faction in the State 
Duma "the cheapest" deputies, because they cost the state less 
than any other party in the election campaign. 
  Representatives of Russia's Choice and the Yabloko Bloc were 
not immediately available to make explanations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal </F>
Democratic Party in Russia, in Moscow by ASAHI Newstar 
Television political commentator Soichiro Tahara from Tokyo via 
satellite on the "Sunday Project" program; date not given -- 
recorded, in Russian with passage-by-passage translation into 
Japanese; translated from the Japanese] 
  [Text] [Tahara] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, good morning. I would 
like to thank you for appearing on our interview program. In 
general elections held last December, the Liberal Democracy 
Party [LDP] led by you won many seats, triggering a big 
sensation around the world. How has Russia changed since the 
LDP was formed? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Russia has not changed at all since our party 
has not been in control of the government. The LDP's advances 
in the Duma at the end of the general elections means the 
emergence of a patriotic party there. Our party has worked to 
release all political prisoners by seeking amnesty for them. 
Our party is working to improve the economy. At present, our 
party is working to overcome difficulties facing our nation's 
economy by helping the government. At the same time, our party 
is demanding the replacement of some cabinet members. 
Specifically, our party is demanding the replacement of six 
cabinet members. Mr. Shakhray, one of the six cabinet members, 
has already quit the cabinet. Mr. Kozyrev, whom the Japanese 
like, will soon resign as foreign minister. I believe that a 
new government will be inaugurated in the fall. In this way, 
our party has been influencing Russia's domestic and foreign 
policies. Needless to say, our party is directly influencing 
the president. 
  [Tahara] In search of a political truce, President Yeltsin 
concluded a national consensus accord with other political 
parties on 28 April. We at first thought that the LDP would 
reject the president's offer. At present, the Russian Communist 
Party and other parties rejected the president's offer. But 
your party signed the accord. Why did your party sign that 
accord? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The truth is just the opposite. Our party 
will continue to fight President Yeltsin. Our party has never 
stopped the fight even one day. If our party takes a hard-line 
stance on the president, the president would challenge our 
party. Our party intends to seize power by merely exposing the 
president's faults. Our party plans to become the largest party 
after giving the president a chance to step down. 
  [Tahara] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, you are making very soft comments 
today. According to the results of recent polls conducted by 
Russian newspapers, the popularity rating of you and your party 
is falling. What is your opinion? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Poll results are faked. The influence of me 
and my party is growing across the nation. If a correspondent 
from your TV station visits a Russian town with me, he would 
instantly see this. I plan to visit a town in Moscow next 
Sunday. If the correspondent from your station visits the town 
with me, he would find how much influence I have. Russian TV 
and newspaper reports are 90 percent false. You would see this 
if you recall what the Russian media reported before and after 
the 12 December general elections. I know that the best party 
is mine. You are speaking based on false figures and 
information. To be honest, the most powerful party in Russia is 
the LDP. As a politician, I am in a leading position. In 
Russia, no politician can stand shoulder to shoulder with me. 
Therefore, Russian politicians fear and slander the LDP. Japan 
also is slandering our party. 
  [Tahara] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, you visited such European nations 
as France and Poland. During your stay in those nations, you 
made radical and nationalistic statements. You were expelled 
from Bulgaria and Slovenia for such statements. Why did you 
make such radical statements? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I have never intended to worsen Russia's 
relations with other nations. The Bulgarian Government probably 
did not like me, but thousands of Bulgarians welcomed me, 
throwing flowers at me and kissing my hands. What is important 
to me was the Bulgarian people. To speak of Poland, I had no 
problem in Poland. The Polish people warmly greeted me. Many 
nations have invited me to visit. It is true that I have caused 
troubles. The LDP is a new party. I think that some nations 
still do not understand what sort of policies the LDP pursues 
and what sort of party it is. It is true that an international 
organization is moving to block the LDP from expanding its 
influence at home and abroad. I do not like to cause trouble. 
  [Tahara] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, are you satisfied with Russia's 
current borderlines with other nations? Or are you thinking of 
further expanding Russia's current borders? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The Soviet Union's former borderlines must be 
Russia's borderlines. Our party holds this idea. I think that 
Russia needs to change its borderlines to strengthen its 
security. There is no problem with Russia's borderlines in the 
Far East. There also is no problem with Russia's borderlines to 
the north, but there is a problem with Russia's borderlines to 
the west. The problem with Russia's borders in the west can be 
resolved in an economic way. The three Baltic nations, 
Byelarus, and Ukraine will return to Russia sometime in the 
future. To the south, however, war is raging in the Caucasus 
and Central Asia. Islamic forces cannot be taken lightly and 
the interests of major nations are intertwined in the region. 
We need to draw new borderlines in this region to keep the 
region from posing any threat to Russia. 
  [Tahara] Looking at President Yeltsin's foreign policy, it 
is said that he has usurped Zhirinovskiy's policy of pursuing a 
superpower. What is your opinion? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I and President Yeltsin have many areas of 
agreement. I am now on good terms with him. I believe that the 
time will come when the president will dismiss cabinet members 
our party opposes and our party's platform will become Russia's 
platform. 
  [Tahara] Are you joking? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No, I am not joking because the Russian 
Government has been changing its domestic and foreign policies 
little by little. 
  [Tahara] Who do you think you will succeed President 
Yeltsin? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I intend to run in the presidential election 
if and when it is held. There is no other candidate to compete 
with President Yeltsin in the election. All other Russian 
politicians are weak and cowardly. The presidential election 
can be sooner if Mr. Yeltsin wants to hold it sooner. If Mr. 
Yeltsin does not hope to advance the presidential election, it 
will be held 12 June 1996. A new president will be chosen in the 
election. I assume that the presidential elections could be 
held earlier. 
  [Tahara] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, how are you going to deal with 
Japan? What do you think of Japan? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I think we can build up a special 
relationship with Japan. Although Japan is an advanced nation, 
it is in need of raw materials. Russia has abundant raw 
materials. Also, Japan is seeking a positive solution to the 
northern territorial dispute between the two countries. But you 
cannot expect the settlement of this dispute if Japan negotiates 
with the Communist Party or reformists. 
  [Tahara] What do you think of the northern territorial 
issue? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Whomever we negotiate with, we will give 
nothing. But there is an option that will satisfy Japan. I 
myself have explained this option several times to Japanese 
people, including the Japanese news media. We will never give 
away the islands for nothing. But if Japan shows its 
understanding about Russia's plan to draw new boundaries in the 
Mediterranean and the Indian Sea, where war is currently being 
waged, I think we can offer a reasonable and well-balanced 
solution that will satisfy Japan. 
  We have a problem in the south. We need new boundaries in 
areas south of Russia, including the Caucasus, Central Asia, 
Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan. If Japan takes sides with us or 
adopts a neutral position on this issue, we will be able to pay 
more attention to the northern territorial dispute. If Russia 
acquires new territories in the south with Japan's help, no one 
in Russia will oppose the Kremlin's proposal that the northern 
territorial issue be settled on favorable terms to Japan. In 
this case, we can protect the two nations' interests. Russia 
can protect its interests in the Mediterranean, while Japan can 
protect its interests in the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk, 
and the Pacific Ocean. 
  [Tahara] Do you mean that depending on terms, Russia might 
possibly return the northern territories to Japan? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I cannot answer your question because what we 
discuss here will be heard by millions of people and people in 
other countries. Negotiations on this matter should be made in 
a place where secrecy can be maintained. This is not a matter 
to be discussed on a TV program. We should discuss this issue 
in a place where secrecy can be maintained and while looking at 
maps. Reviewing historical facts, each side should submit their 
options for the solution. We will then discuss the options' 
good points. This should satisfy Japan. 
  By the way, I am planning to visit Pyongyang in August this 
year. It is not far from Pyongyang to Japan. So, how about my 
visiting Tokyo at that time and discussing in detail this issue? 
I do not want to fly to the Far East twice. As you know, it 
takes nine hours by plane. Let us discuss it at a different 
place. I do not mind discussing it at the Defense Agency or the 
Foreign Ministry or at a government special service agency. 
  [Tahara] Let me confirm what you have just said. You want 
to visit Japan and you are asking me to make arrangements for 
the visit. Am I right? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I can visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 
10 August to show that I am pro-Japanese. I think the United 
States' atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a cruel 
criminal act. I think it is not so bad for the Japanese to hear 
the leader of the largest party in Russia calling for solidarity 
between the two nations.

<F P=106> [Text of document signed by former Vice President Aleksandr </F>
Rutskoy, dated 19 May 1994 and delivered by him to the Moscow 
City Prosecutor's Office, under general headline: "Reply to the 
Authorities"] 
  [Text] As is well known, acting Russian Prosecutor General 
Ilyushenko has instructed the Moscow City Prosecutor's Office to 
investigate the legality of the public utterances of opposition 
leaders on 9 and 14 May 1994. On 19 May former Russian Vice 
President Rutskoy gave explanations to the Moscow City 
Prosecutor's Office. Rutskoy's attorney, Yu.P. Ivanov, who was 
present when these explanations were given, asked our editorial 
office to publish the full text of them. 
  To the Moscow City Prosecutor's office from Aleksandr 
Vladimirovich Rutskoy 
  Explanations 
  In connection with the series of questions raised by 
representatives of the Moscow City Prosecutor's Office about my 
speeches on 9 May 1994 and 14 May 1994, I am able to provide the 
following clarification. 
  First, I should like to note that the investigation of the 
legality of the actions of the participants in the rally which 
took place during the Victory Day demonstration is being carried 
out on the direct instructions of acting Russian Federation 
Prosecutor General Ilyushenko. In my view, this post does not 
exist. There can only be an acting prosecutor general if there 
is a legally appointed prosecutor general who is temporarily 
absent -- on vacation, for example. In this instance President 
Yeltsin, ignoring his own Constitution and the opinion of the 
Federation Council, is keeping one of his own minions in this 
artificial post (acting prosecutor general). It is no 
coincidence that former Prosecutor General Kazannik calls 
Ilyushenko nothing more than a puppet. Ilyushenko does not have 
even an elementary notion of personal dignity. One might think 
that after the vote at the Federation Council, which rejected 
his nomination, Ilyushenko would simply have given up his claims 
to this post. But he has not done so, and this, it seems to me, 
is the best indication of his moral qualities. He has a 
definite interest in me. It was he who, together with Andrey 
Makarov [staffer of Interdepartmental Commission To Combat Crime 
and Corruption], was a most active liar who spread rumors which 
impugned my honor and dignity when he accused me of involvement 
with some Swiss bank accounts which I was supposed to have. In 
so saying, in my view, he not only lied but also committed 
perjury. And I hope that Ilyushenko will still be accountable 
for this vile act. 
  As for my actual actions on 9 and 14 May, I see nothing 
unlawful in them. The texts of my speeches contain nothing 
"criminal." 
  Yes, I believe that today the country is being ruled by a 
regime of President Yeltsin's absolute power. 
  Yes, I believe that this regime is pursuing an antipeople 
policy of selling out to foreign interests and thereby 
destroying our Motherland. 
  Yes, I believe that representatives of the patriotic 
opposition must come to power in the country, and I hope that, 
despite all the regime's convulsions, victory will go the 
patriots. 
  Yes, I believe that it would be good if this happened by the 
50th anniversary of the Victory over Fascism, that is, by May 
1995. 
  I think that the unification of various social forces and 
support for their demands by the majority of the people will 
force President Yeltsin to honor the public commitment he made 
(and which he himself is crudely violating) to call early 
presidential elections. I hope that these elections will be won 
by the presidential candidate for whom the most important thing 
is service of the people and the Motherland, a candidate who 
will pursue an economic program which reflects first and 
foremost the interests of the hapless working people today. 
  It was just such a result that I had in mind when I spoke 
about the future victory! That is how I see it. 
  I believe that my speech was couched in ideological terms 
which are the norm today. That is how many political leaders 
speak today, and there was nothing unusual in my speech. The 
propresident sycophants (officials in the president's entourage 
as well as journalists who serve the regime) are using far 
harsher terms about me and the patriotic opposition. 
  So why do they find my replies intolerable? The answer is 
obvious. These people live in a state of perpetual fear. The 
fear of responsibility. Responsibility for what they done: the 
destruction of a mighty Fatherland -- the USSR; the 
impoverishment of the majority of the people; the gunning down 
of the legislative authorities; and much more. The only way in 
which these cliques can suppress that fear is by driving their 
political opponents into the concentration camps. In my case 
they want to find a new pretext for arresting me. I despise 
these pygmies. And I think I have the right to criticize them 
publicly irrespective of the fact that they are "representatives 
of the authorities." In my criticism of this or that individual 
there is no legal norm which would oblige me to make my 
criticism commensurate with the office in question and thus I am 
not breaking the law. But there is one thing of which I want to 
assure those ordinary citizens who believe in me -- I am 
prepared to stay in jail the rest of my life for the sake of my 
people, my Motherland, and its true interests. I have not 
appealed to Yeltsin and his puppets for a pardon and I am not 
going to. 
  Nor can I make any comment on the burning of the Russian 
Federation flag because I simply did not see that happen. I can 
only express my own opinion about why this flag was burned. 
Today's Russian Federation flag looks like the one that was used 
during the Great Patriotic War by Vlasov's traitors. For that 
reason I can understand the feelings of former front-liners who 
fought against Vlasov's traitors and defended a different flag 
-- the red flag. And defended it with their blood.... 
  I have nothing more to add to that.

<F P=106> ["`Soyuz' Group Appeal" -- SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA headline] </F>
  [Text] Dear compatriots, fellow citizens, and friends! 
  We are now in the third year of the great tragedy of which 
the "Soyuz" group of the Congress of USSR People's Deputies 
repeatedly warned. It is time to sober up: Not only the 
peoples but also their leaders have had bitter experience of 
"salvation" apart. Now everyone sees that this is impossible. 
Our strength resided and will reside in the unity of peoples 
and territories. Our strength resided and will reside in the 
correct cause of mutual assistance, sincere friendship, and 
cooperation. Our strength resided and will reside in the clear 
realization that each of our peoples stands to gain more in a 
unified Union than without it. 
  The restoration of a unified Union should not be seen as the 
restoration of the featureless dominion of the totalitarian 
bureaucracy. That would be a step back. The basis of the new 
union must be a political, economic, legal, and cultural area of 
multiethnic states. 
  In that form cooperation between peoples and states will 
make 
it possible to make the best use of the wealth of natural 
resources, industrial potential, and possibilities of 
agriculture. This will ensure the highest labor productivity -- 
the only real basis for an increase in the standard of living 
and prosperity of all peoples and society as a whole. The 
state's coordinating role in the development of the economy 
should be commensurate with the acuteness of the social tasks 
that this state is urged to resolve by the whole course of 
history. By virtue of its uncontrolled laws of price formation, 
competition, and the activity of investment areas, the market 
should not be the main regulator of commodity and money 
relations. 
  Only a unified army and unified state security organs can be 
the guarantors of the state's national security. The state 
should provide the defenders of the fatherland with firm social 
guarantees. 
  We deputies within the "Soyuz" group have not betrayed our 
principles and remain true to our positions to this day despite 
the taunts unleashed against us by many mass media. We 
previously advocated the preservation of the unified state, and 
today our main and sole objective is the restoration and 
strengthening of the state system, the restoration of our common 
home -- as a renewed union of peoples -- and the unity of all 
our territories. 
  As you know, during the Second "Soyuz" Congress the group 
was 
reorganized into an all-Union association of deputies of all 
levels, and the "Soyuz" People's Foundation was set up. A 
presidium session has decided to hold the third congress of the 
"Soyuz" movement at the end of July 1994. 
  We appeal to all members of the "Soyuz" deputies' group, to 
people's deputies past and present of all levels, to all those 
who support a strong, unified state -- a Union of peoples -- to 
step up the work of our organizational structures in the 
localities and enlist the public at large. 
  Today "Soyuz" is ready to cooperate with all parties and 
movements that aim to revive our unified state for the sake of 
national peace and harmony and for the sake of the well-being 
and prosperity of our peoples. 
  It is still not too late, it is still possible to restore 
our 
common home -- the Soviet Union. 
  [Signed] G.I. Tikhonov, chairman of the "Soyuz" People's 
Foundation; V. Alksnis; S. Baburin; V. Varennikov; G. Kadyrov; 
N. Muradyan; F. Salmanov; A. Chekhoyev; V. Yakubov; B. Oleynik.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow NTV in Russian at 1700 GMT on 15 
May carries a live or recorded interview with Gennadiy Burbulis, 
State Duma deputy and former chief presidential advisor, by 
correspondent Yevgeniy Kiselev in Moscow. 
  Kiselev begins the conversation by saying that many people 
of 
the presidential team were sacked recently or have fallen in 
disgrace, all of them from the Democratic Russia party. As an 
example, he cites (?Sabyanin) and Filippov. He asks Burbulis if 
it is a chain of coincidences or if there is some logic in it. 
  Burbulis answers: "I believe one cannot build a vision of a 
deep strategy on these two examples. Simultaneously, the 
administration has brought in such powerful thinkers as Yasen, 
Lifshitsh, or Baturin. These are the president's very good 
buys." 
  Kiselev goes on to say that in his recently published 
memoirs, Yeltsin speaks more than candidly about his early 
comrades-in-arms, namely Yegor Gaydar and Gennadiy Burbulis 
himself. He asks if it means that in political terms, Yeltsin 
is now bidding good-bye to his political past when liberals were 
his closest allies. 
  Burbulis answers: "I am not excluding this. I believe, 
however, everything is not so simple. Today Yeltsin is looking 
for a new social base and a new political structure and 
professional environment. Unfortunately, he still insists he is 
the president of the entire people, but his personal 
psychological directives are not reflecting the real situation 
in the country." 
  Kiselev wonders whether what Burbulis means is that there 
are 
social groups in the country that do not acknowledge Yeltsin as 
a leader. 
  Burbulis says: "No doubt, there should be a will and an 
ability to search for consensus with opponents and the ability 
to create an attractive and a convincing environment that at the 
same time would be clear for a grassroot voter as well as 
attractive for the intellectuals in society. Here our president 
is facing big problems today. Yeltsin's prestige was based more 
on the idea of a charismatic leader who is able to tackle global 
issues personally. This image met the psychology of fast, easy 
results and victories over the past. But that time is gone. 
Now endlessly blaming communists for ruining the country, or 
endlessly praising themselves -- `we are democrats, who had 
courageously taken on the responsibility for society and who now 
have the right to influence it, because of our political record' 
-- all this is no big deal any more, it is all secondary." 
  Kiselev says this statement seems to contradict the stance 
of 
his former allies in the Democratic Russia and Russia's Choice 
parties. 
  Burbulis disagrees, saying: "I do not agree with your 
question. Unlike you, I can't describe my political allies in 
Democratic Russia as former. They have been and remain my 
allies. There is a question of a different understanding of the 
strategy and tactics of achieving the same human, normal, and 
kind ideals that united us in the first place." 
  Kiselev says that Burbulis left Russia's Choice and that is 
why he uses the word former. Burbulis continues: "I have not 
abandoned my allies politically or personally. I have come out 
to welcome the new political reality in the country, new ideas 
and people." 
  Kiselev presses on, saying that after discovering Gaydar to 
political life, Burbulis ended up being pushed out and is not 
even a supporting principal any more. 
  Burbulis replies: "I regret very much not being able to give 
a distinct explanation for my recent decisions and having to 
constantly put this idea that Gaydar and Burbulis were unable to 
share the posts behind me. I think you know very well why I 
left the government. It was at the insistence and strategically 
stubborn pushing of the opposition and at the demand of 
Khasbulatov." 
  Kiselev says the Yeltsin memoirs give a completely different 
version of the reasons for Burbulis's departure, saying that the 
president asked him to take a rest. 
  Burbulis says: "I agree that it is perfectly natural for a 
man to get tired and, in that regard, I both understand and 
agree with Boris Nikolayevich. It is for God to judge his 
opinions and conclusions." 
  Kiselev asks if Burbulis finds the harshness of some of his 
assessments and conclusions offensive. 
  Burbulis responds: "I'm not offended at all. I think he has 
the right to his ideas and opinions. But he should be quite 
tolerant as regards the analyses to which I think his memoirs 
will now be subjected, because there was a certain human 
etiquette and unwritten code in our political relations. In the 
case in question, when the president opens the door through his 
writings and invites us to express our opinions on the key 
problems of Russian history of that period, then we're not 
talking about competing with him, but of the moral right we have 
been given. I think this will be realized very quickly." 
  Kiselev asks if Burbulis intends setting up a party of his 
own now that he has left Russia's Choice. 
  Burbulis answers: "I am convinced we do not need at all 
costs to set up a party as such. We need to assist the 
formation of an efficient party system in the country. This 
system is in fact already being formed, but lacks two principal, 
essential elements. We have two oganizations -- what they call 
themselves is not important. What is important is that one of 
them will be closer to the so-called social-democratic program. 
So the need arises to form a right-of-center organization 
completely loyal to the ideas of the liberals. This 
organization, in union with the social democrats, must be set up 
not by people drifting from the communist bloc in a desperate 
attempt to get votes; it must be set up consciously by people 
who have taken on reform and who have a strategy they 
understand." 
  Kiselev asks if Burbulis sees himself as the leader of this 
party, or as second man in the shadows, the man who would "push 
to the fore some charismatic leader." 
  Burbulis answers: "I do not see myself as someone who could 
be a useful or nice leader, either in a party or state 
structure. My experience has taught me that I have skills 
others do not possess. But, aside from the temptation of taking 
up such a role or post, my strengths, in my opinion, lie 
elsewhere -- in my ability to work out long-term strategic ideas 
for the development of the country, society, and state." 
  Kiselev refers to the problem of finding a successor to 
Yeltsin. 
  Burbulis replies: "We suffered from illusions that it would 
be easy to find a president who would come along and put things 
right quickly. There is also the pyscholgical law of electoral 
campaigns and of the society's socio-psycholgical state. As far 
as I understand it today, that law requires us to give a clear 
and honest answer: if it's not Yeltsin, and if we are speaking 
about the generation of 40- to 50-year-olds, the country does 
not know that person yet."

  [Text] The head of the Russian Parliament's upper house 
Vladimir Shumeyko believes that the Duma should suspend its 
debate of a federal bill on media coverage of state power 
structures and return it for additional scrutiny. 
  As Interfax has learned from well-placed parliamentary 
sources, Shumeyko addressed to Duma's Chairman Ivan Rybkin a 
letter, saying that "the bill looks like an army drill 
instruction and has nothing in common with democracy and the 
free press." Its enactment, in Shumeyko's view, "may induce a 
significant infringement of the freedom of the press in Russia, 
and endless and senseless law-making activity since both the 
Constitution of Russia and the Federal Media Law would have to 
be changed." 
  Drafted by the Information Policy and Communication 
Committee, the bill contravenes article 29 and many other points 
of the federal Constitution. In Shumeyko's opinion, "the 
constitution's ban on censorship is covertly breached by a whole 
range of the bill's clauses." 
  "Although the draft law starts with independence guarantees, 
it ends with threats of trial, criminal punishment, penalties 
and sanctions. Yet, in Russia's Penal Code there isn't a word 
about punishing a journalist for doing or not doing what a state 
body wished him to do," Shumeyko remarked.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Around the Clock Non-Stop" </F>
rubric: "Newspaper Is Illegal But It Does Not Care"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the Judicial Chamber for Information 
Disputes under the Russian president completed hearing the case 
of an illegal registration of the AL KODS, a Communist newspaper. 
  The court deemed that the Ministry of Press and Information 
violated Articles 7 and 13 of the law on the mass media in 
registering the publication. They say that foreign citizens who 
are not permanent residents on the territory of Russia cannot 
register their publications. 
  At the same time Shaabad Hafez, citizen of Jordan, has been 
publishing this newspaper for over two years. The Russian Press 
Committee has been ordered to annul the false "certificate of 
registration." 
  The newspaper does not despair nevertheless. An AL KODS fete 
is to take place at the Central Tourist House. Rutskoy, 
Khasbulatov, Umalatova, Terekhov, Baburin, Zyuganov, Nevzorov, 
Prokhanov, Chikin, and the friend of the Arabs, Zhirinovskiy, 
have been invited. It has even been promised that the 
ambassadors of Iran and Iraq will be on hand.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Reincarnation of the Censor...."] </F>
  [Text] The IZVESTIYA editorial office has received an 
"official warning" signed by V. Volodin, first deputy chairman 
of the Russian Federation Committee for the Press. We received 
the latest "reprimand" for the same reason -- because IZVESTIYA 
published in issues Nos. 14-18 1994 an article by I. Dementyeva 
entitled "War and Peace in Prigorodnyy Rayon." 
  Quoting several sections from the article, the author 
explains why the "warning" has been given. Certain claims and 
statements "serve to kindle ethnic intolerance and enmity." 
Following this formidable, peremptory criminal-legal diagnosis 
it only remained to cite Article 74 of the RSFSR Criminal Code 
under which the offender should be indicted..... But the point 
is that the Russian Committee for the Press has clearly gone 
beyond the bounds of its competence and exceeded its authority. 
The only bodies that could in this instance determine the legal 
nature of the article are the prosecutor's office and a court. 
But things did not reach the courts since the Russian General 
Prosecutor's Office refused to institute criminal proceedings in 
respect of the publication of I. Dementyeva's article owing to 
absence of criminal events and corpus delicti. 
  You get the impression that when formulating its decision 
the 
Russian Committee for the Press availed itself of the ruling on 
this matter produced by the Court of Appeal for Information 
Disputes, whose findings the editorial office categorically 
rejected (see IZVESTIYA No. 59 for 30 March this year). But 
even this ruling does not say a word about kindling ethnic 
enmity. It is quite possible that some third body, which has 
arbitrarily assumed the functions of a reincarnation of the 
censor, will draw an even more radical conclusion. 
  Incidentally, attempts to take charge of the press are 
becoming more and more aggressive. Recently a certain current 
information center sent to IZVESTIYA the actual ruling of the 
Court of Appeal for Information Disputes and the Republic of 
North Ossetia Supreme Soviet decree. The accompanying letter 
peremptorily asked for these documents to be published and ended 
with the unprecedented postscript: "Please inform us of the 
dates of publication." The center's leader A. Remizov could not 
find anything to say in response to our official query (a purely 
rhetorical query, to be frank) as to the normative documents on 
which this request was based and he did not press for his 
demands to be met. 
  There have recently been repeated attempts to subordinate 
IZVESTIYA and you know how they have ended. The editorial 
office and the creative collective are resolutely rejecting the 
latest attempts.

information from the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public 
Opinion. In mid-May the center conducted a poll among 1,600

  [Text] According to a decree on complex measures to ensure 
prompt and entire collection of taxes and duties signed by 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin Monday, all taxpayers will have 
to register in the State Taxation Service. The decree 
stipulates that taxpayers may open accounts with banks only if 
they have been properly registered. 
  If an enterprise violates the procedure, it will be 
administratively imposed a fine of one hundred minimum salaries. 
At the moment, the minimum salary in Russia is 14,700 rubles. 
  In case of a repeated violation, the taxation service 
reports 
it to the Central Bank of Russia. The tax evader will be 
abolished and its incomes confiscated by the treasury. 
  According to the decree, a taxpayer may have one current and 
one budget accounts with a bank for his operations within the 
scope of his activities. 
  Taxpayers must submit information on their open accounts, 
including hard currency, loans, deposits both in Russia and 
abroad. 
  The decree came into force once signed.

<F P=106> ["Decree of the President of the Russian Federation on </F>
Reform of State Enterprises" -- ITAR-TASS headline] 
  [Text] [No dateline as received] With the aim of ensuring 
management of the state sector of the economy and effective 
utilization and preservation of state assets in the Russian 
Federation, I RESOLVE as follows. 
  1. That it be deemed necessary to implement, beginning in 
1994, a reform of state enterprises that entails: 
  an end to the creation of new federal state enterprises 
assigned and enjoying full economic rights over state assets; 
  conversion of a limited number of federal state enterprises 
under liquidation into economically-active establishments -- 
treasury [kazennyy] factories, treasury plants, and treasury 
economic units -- which shall assume the right to operational 
management of all the assets of the federal state enterprises 
under liquidation. 
  2. That rulings to liquidate federal state enterprises and 
convert them into treasury factories (treasury plants, treasury 
economic units) shall be made on the following grounds: 
  use of allocated federal resources for purposes other than 
intended; 
  failure to derive profit for the previous two years; 
  breach of existing rules governing use by an enterprise of 
state immovable assets assigned to its economic control. 
  In this Decree, a breach of existing rules shall be 
construed 
as inclusion of such assets into enterprises' authorized 
capitals (subsidiaries' excepted), or their disposal by lease, 
sale, or transfer to the use of other incorporated entities 
without the authority of the relevant state body. 
  3. That rulings to liquidate federal state enterprises and 
convert them into treasury factories (treasury plants, treasury 
economic units) shall be applied only to industrial or 
agricultural federal state enterprises: 
  engaged in activities reserved by federal laws exclusively 
for state enterprises; 
  of whose products (works, services) the primary consumer 
(over 50 percent) is the state; 
  privatization of which is prohibited by the State Program of 
Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises. 
  Other federal state enterprises may be liquidated and 
converted into treasury factories (treasury works, treasury 
economic entities) in circumstances laid down by federal laws or 
decrees of the President of the Russian Federation. 
  4. That a ruling to liquidate federal state enterprises and 
convert them into treasury factories (treasury plants, treasury 
economic units) shall be made by the Government of the Russian 
Federation if one or more conditions, envisioned by clause two 
herein are presented by either the relevant bodies of the 
executive power or the enterprise itself. 
  Such a ruling cannot be made with regard to a federal state 
enterprise not prohibited from privatization by the State 
Program of Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises and 
having submitted a privatization application by 1 July 1994 in 
accordance with the established procedure. 
  5. That during adoption of a ruling to liquidate federal 
state enterprises and convert them into treasury factories 
(treasury plants, treasury economic units], the Government of 
the Russian Federation shall: 
  determine the composition of the commission on liquidation 
which shall liquidate the enterprise in accordance with the 
legislation of the Russian Federation; 
  allocate means for the liquidation of federal state 
enterprises; 
  decide on the federal body of the executive power which 
immediately after liquidation will confirm the articles of 
association of treasury factories (treasury plants, treasury 
economic units) created from liquidated federal state 
enterprises. 
  6. That during the creation of treasury factories (treasury 
plants, treasury economic units) from liquidated federal state 
enterprises, the following shall be prohibited: 
  reduction in the number of jobs compared to that at the 
liquidated federal state enterprise upon decision to liquidate; 
  refusal to employ employees of the liquidated federal state 
enterprise; 
  assignment of assets of part thereof of the liquidated 
federal state enterprise to other incorporated entities or 
individual persons. 
  All expenditure on the liquidation of a federal state 
enterprise and also on settlement with its creditors shall be 
from the federal budget. 
  7. That a treasury factory (treasury plant, treasury 
economic unit) created from a liquidated federal state 
enterprise: 
  shall be the successor to the liquidated enterprise in 
respect of federal funds previously allocated and also in 
respect of usage of land, natural resources, and subterranean 
resources, and quotas and licenses; 
  shall independently market its products (works, services) 
and 
utilize profit, unless otherwise stipulated by legislation of 
the Russian Federation or its articles of association; 
  shall not create subsidiaries, be a founder investor of 
other 
enterprises, establishments, and organizations without the 
consent of the Government of the Russian Federation or an 
authority appointed by it; 
  shall not dispose of, let, transfer use of, or mortgage 
immovable state assets assigned to it without the consent of the 
Government of the Russian Federation or an authority appointed 
by it; 
  shall receive credits only against guarantees of the 
Government of the Russian Federation. 
  8. That the standard articles of association of a treasury 
factory (treasury plant, treasury economic unit) created from a 
liquidated federal state enterprise shall be endorsed by the 
Government of the Russian Federation. 
  The articles of association of a treasury factory (treasury 
plant, treasury economic unit) shall define: 
  its accountability requirements in the forms stipulated by 
the Government of the Russian Federation; 
  the personal liability of its director for its economic 
performance; 
  its obligation to utilize federal funds according to their 
intended purpose; 
  the type of business and profit-sharing procedure. 
  9. That the Government of the Russian Federation (or 
authority appointed by it) shall be entitled to confiscate from 
a treasury factory (treasury plant, treasury economic unit) 
assets not used or used for other than the intended purpose. 
  10. That the Government of the Russian Federation shall: 
  by 1 July 1994 endorse the standard articles of association 
of a treasury factory (treasury plant, treasury economic unit) 
created from a liquidated federal state enterprise; 
  by 1 August 1994 define the procedure for planning and 
financing the activities of treasury factories (treasury plants, 
treasury economic units), including maintenance of social 
amenities assigned to them, pricing of their products (works, 
services), their finance from the budget and also remuneration 
of their workforces; 
  by 1 July 1994 hear the chairman of the Russian Federation 
State Committee for Management of State Property on compliance 
with deadlines for consideration of privatization applications 
and on the results of work to privatize state and municipal 
enterprises in the Russian Federation. 
  11. To recommend to executive authorities of constituents of 
the Russian Federation that they reform state enterprises under 
their ownership, and to local authorities that they reform 
municipal enterprises. 
  12. That this Decree shall enter into force upon 
publication.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has told the 
government to introduce in parliament by September 15 draft laws 
to lower the number of taxes, decrease the level of profit tax 
and VAT by 10 to 20 percent and also the level of taxes related 
to the rate of pay and production. At the same time, his decree 
of May 23 raises the level of tax for individuals as well as for 
the property of individuals and corporate entities. 
  The decree, which aims to limit inflationary processes, 
reduces the number of goods eligible for a special 13 percent 
VAT rate (against the usual 23 percent). 
  From June 1 the rate of payment to the Social Security fund 
will be lowered from 5.4 to 3.4 percent of the sum of charged 
wages. 
  The government is also to adopt a resolution within the next 
two months concerning the possibilities of accelerated 
amortization of capital funds in highly technical branches of 
industry. 
  The decree lays down that production enterprises, the 
foreign 
share of whose capital is no less than 30 percent or 10 million 
dollars and which were registered after January 1, 1994, will 
not have to pay profit tax for the next two years. Profit tax 
in Russia is up to 38 percent.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] According to the head of the presidential expert 
team, renowned economist Aleksandr Livshits, the current 
situation in Russia is very much alike that in December 1991. 
Like then, the political situation is quite stable and 
favorable for reform. The main goal in the economic sphere now 
should be to stabilize the consumer market and prevent the 
industries from a collapse, he told a briefing in the Kremlin 
Monday. 
  On behalf of the Russian president, Livshits said that the 
head of the state had signed a package of five decrees called to 
impose order in the production sphere. Livshits pointed out 
that Boris Yeltsin fulfilled his constitutional duties and his 
obligations under the Social Accord Treaty by signing these 
documents. 
  According to the first decree, Russian exports will not be 
quoted or licensed as of July 1 1994, except for those under 
interstate agreements already concluded. 
  The second decree deals with taxation. Taxes currently paid 
by enterprises are expected to be cut down by about 10-20 
percent. Simultaneously, the government was asked to consider 
restructuring taxes paid by individuals. The decree envisions 
privileged taxation for enterprises with foreign capital 
provided they produce goods within Russia. 
  The third decree is devoted to the reformation of 
state-owned 
enterprises. According to this decree, no more federal 
enterprises entirely owned by the state will be set up. Part of 
state-owned enterprises will fall into administration. Their 
directors will enjoy limited rights but will bear full 
responsibility for their activities. Livshits emphasized that 
employees of such enterprises would have proper social 
guarantees. He made clear that such enterprises would be set up 
on the basis of enterprises not liable to privatization and at 
the same time poorly managed. 
  Livshits drew journalists' attention to the decree on 
additional measures to normalize payments defining the sequence 
in which payments from an enterprise's current accounts should 
be made. If an enterprise is short of rubles, it will have to 
cover the debt with hard currency. To implement the measure, a 
federal bill chamber will be created. 
  The fifth decree is devoted to strengthening the taxation 
discipline. Legal entities found guilty of dodging taxes for 
the first time will be imposed a huge fine. After a second 
attempt, the enterprise will be closed. Livshits pointed out 
that the decree also envisioned a mechanism for speeding up the 
consideration of enterprises' suits to each other. 
  Another decree the president signed today is not directly 
concerned with the perfection of industrial relations as it 
provides for the consolidation of means of the road construction 
fund in the federal budget. 
  Livshits categorically dismissed the possibility of any 
limitations of freedom on the Russian market by the 
above-mentioned decrees. "These documents are called only to 
impose basic order in the production sphere. The only freedom 
infringed upon is the freedom to steal as much as before," he 
was quoted as saying. 
  According to Livshits, the package will allow to do away 
with 
the poor management of the state-owned sector. He said it was 
impossible to endure any longer such abuses as one's leasing 
state property to oneself or use of state funds for other 
purposes. 
  In an answer to journalists' questions, Livshits stressed 
that the package was only the first step the president made to 
protect the Russian industries. "We hope a second one will 
follow," he said. 
  Livshits pointed to the important part to be played by the 
government and parliament to make the decrees work since the 
very first day.

  [Text] Moscow, 23 May -- The following is the text of an 
edict by the Russian president "on the lifting of quotas and 
licenses on goods and services for export": 
  "To regulate the export of goods and services as well as to 
create equal economic conditions for all parties supplying goods 
beyond Russia's borders, I decree: 
  1. That it be established that from 1 July 1994 quotas and 
licenses for goods and services exported should be applied only 
with regard to those goods and services exported in accordance 
with international obligations of the Russian Federation. 
  2. That the Russian Government should from 1 July 1994 
revoke all privileges with regard to the levying of customs duty 
on exported goods, including budget allocations for the payment 
of customs duty. This applies as well as to the export of goods 
and services for federal and state needs (except for goods 
exported to the countries of the near abroad in accordance with 
inter- governmental agreements). This excludes privileges 
granted in accordance with the Russian law "on customs tariffs," 
the Russian law "on excise duty," and the Russian customs code. 
  3. This decree comes into force from the moment of signing. 
  [Signed] Russian President B. Yeltsin, Moscow, the Kremlin

<F P=106> [Report by political observer Yuriy Lepskiy: "`Essentially </F>
Reform Is Only Starting Now,' Aleksandr Livshits, Leader of the 
Russian President's Group of Experts, Stated at a Kremlin 
Briefing"] 
  [Text] Yesterday President Yeltsin signed six edicts which 
begin a new stage in the economic reform. The president's new 
edicts contain a number of clauses which can only be described 
as sensational. They include the repeal of quotas and licenses 
for deliveries for export. A whole tribe of officials who used 
to receive bribes for issuing licenses and quotas will remain 
without "under the counter" earnings. A special edict of the 
president has put taxes in order. It is planned to reduce their 
number and to lower them by 10-20 percent. A preferential tax 
regime is being introduced for enterprises with foreign 
investments, only in the production sphere, it is true. 
  The creation of new federal state enterprises is ending. 
Some of the existing ones will be transformed into public 
enterprises. The president's edicts also provide for the 
introduction of order in clearing operations. 
  In Aleksandr Livshits' opinion this is the start of a 
fundamental reform in the state sector economy about which a lot 
has been said recently but for whose reform they have not had 
time, being engaged in political battles. This stage of the 
reform, he believes, has become possible only with the advent of 
relative political stability in Russia and the president's 
edicts are nothing other than the literal execution of the 
commitments he assumed under the social accord treaty.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Igor Galkin and Igor Ivantsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 24 TASS -- A Russian Government member 
reported a "certain economic stabilisation" in the country and 
said it is necessary to introduce a fixed rouble exchange rate 
to promote investments into the economy. 
  "A number of measures taken by the government allowed to 
stabilise the situation in the economy to a ceratin extent", 
Deputy Economics Minister Sergey Vasilyev told a conference in 
Moscow on Tuesday. 
  Among the measures he listed the strengthening of the rouble 
in comparison to the national currencies of other former Soviet 
republics, curtailing monthly inflation to 8-9 per cent and 
cancelling easy-term crediting, import subsidies and export 
quotas. 
  However, Vasilyev believes that it is necessary to introduce 
a fixed rouble exchange rate to further strengthen the Russian 
currency. To stipulate production it is necessary to attract 
finances of the population, he said and added that in order to 
stabilise the rouble in general and return to it the trust of 
most depositors it is necessary to introduce a fixed rouble 
exchange rate. 
  The fight with inflation remains the main task of the 
government this year, according to Vasilyev who said that it is 
necessary to decrease the budget deficit to achieve the goal. 
The deficit currently amounts to 10 per cent of the gross 
national product, according to him. However, he said it is 
impossible to cut state expenses. The deficit can be decreased 
through restructuring the state spendings which would take some 
two-three years. 
  Vasilyev also urged to improve tax collection which dropped 
to 10 per cent of the gross national product last year. He 
admitted that tax dodging sharply went up from the middle of 
1993. The total amount of collected taxes should reach 16 per 
cent of the GNP to stabilise the situation in the sphere, 
according to him.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Belyanchev and Marina Lebedeva report: "Refugees: </F>
Long Time of Torment"] 
  [Text] This photograph was taken in a corridor of 
"Samargorgrazhdanstroy's" hostel, whose top, ninth floor has now 
been taken over by refugees from hot spots in the former USSR 
and from those CIS countries where the Russian-speaking 
population has felt discriminated against. Some of the refugees 
have already lived here for more than a year, paying between 
20,000 and 30,000 rubles a month for a tiny room. Twenty-six 
families are housed here, while approximately 6,000 such people 
have been registered, in all, in Samara alone. Since many 
plants in the city are idle or are "half-working," it is very 
hard for the newcomers to find work. The refugees' prospect of 
acquiring housing is also virtually nil. The municipal budget 
is inadequate to house even those on its own waiting list. 
According to Oleg Sysuyev, the city's mayor, Samara has given 
up practically all it could to accommodate the refugees -- rest 
homes, guest houses, tourist bases.... 
  The situation in Samara is archetypal for many cities in 
Russia. 
  As of 1 January this year, according to the data of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, there were 609,085 refugees and 
displaced persons in the Russian Federation, and this figure is 
growing. The average percentage of the number of refugees and 
displaced persons in the Russian Federation as a whole stands at 
0.47 percent. The North Caucasus region is most saturated: The 
Ingush Republic -- approximately 50 percent of the size of the 
local population; North Ossetia -- 7.5 percent; Stavropol Kray 
-- 3.5 percent; Krasnodar Kray -- 2.7 percent; Rostov Oblast -- 
0.7 percent. The percentage of refugees and displaced persons 
is higher than the average for the Russian Federation in certain 
oblasts in the Central Region: Belgorod and Tambov Oblasts -- 
0.8 percent; Orel Oblast -- 0.6 percent; Kaluga Oblast -- 0.5 
percent. 
  In 1992, as is known, the Russian Federation Government 
adopted the long-term republic program "Migration" geared to 
supporting refugees and displaced persons from countries in the 
near abroad. But it is being implemented with tremendous 
difficulty. Until our economy starts working in the new, market 
way, the country will be unable to substantially ease the lot of 
migrants and other categories of people who find themselves in 
dire need.

Council, a special program has been worked out for this purpose. 
It is aimed first of all "at developing smart weapons and means 
of protection from them and also at achieving a high level of 
efficiency of a relatively small, but formidable army," Andrey 
Kokoshin said. To this end, a working group at the Defense 
Ministry's Military-Technical Policy Council has been set up. 
However, according to the working group experts, "its 
implementation is under threat because of the drastic 
deterioration of the situation with defense spending."

<F P=106> ["NG" report under the "In Brief Rubric: "Irina Khakamada </F>
is for the Military"] 
  [Text] State Duma Deputy Irina Khakamada supports the 
recommendations of the enlarged session of the Russian 
Federation State Duma Defense Committee on increasing defense 
spending to 55 trillion rubles from the 37.1 trillion that 
figure in the draft Russian Federation budget currently under 
discussion in the second reading. This sum could ensure that 
the cost stays at the 1993 level in the actual implementation of 
the budget. The Defense Committee's amendment did not go 
through, however, at its first reading. Explaining her 
position, Mrs. Khakamada said this is the minimal cost needed to 
preserve the armed forces' combat effectiveness, maintain 
important defense products, and carry through military reform. 
The position on the question is a matter of principle for me, 
she stated. It is the direct function of the state and one of 
its main duties to increase the country's defense capability, as 
well as to solve the social problems of servicemen and of their 
families, even if there is a budget deficit. This constitutes 
the fundamental difference between keeping defense outlays at 
the necessary level and deficit financing of inefficient sectors 
of the national economy. Sustaining the army even at the cost 
of a budget deficit makes the state stronger in the final 
analysis, whereas uncontrolled spending of funds dictated by the 
lobbyists of various sectors only weakens it.

  [Text] A statement sent on Monday to Duma members by the 
leaders of four Russian defense trade unions, speaks of the 
inevitability of the Russian government repealing the state 
order for the defense industry if the cut-backs in state funding 
of arms purchases laid down in the draft 1994 budget remain in 
force. The leaders base their call on the fact that the money 
reserved will only pay for the debts for goods already produced. 
In addition, 80 percent of defense enterprises will go bankrupt 
and 1.4 million people lose their jobs simultaneously. 
  The statement stresses that 30 trillion rubles will be 
required for the payment of unemployment benefit alone and the 
inhabitants of 70 factory towns will be without means for 
survival. 
  In order to prevent such a turn of events, the leaders 
believe it essential to insist on the preservation of the level 
of funding in line with the state order for 1994 and on opening 
credit lines for conversion programs. They also call on 
deputies to take measures to increase the budget income by 
stimulating production, collecting taxes fully, effectively 
organizing the sale of arms and military technology abroad as 
well as the export of civilian products produced at military 
plants following conversion, with the direct involvement of the 
producing enterprises.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Reserve Officers Called Up Again"] </F>
  [Text] Some 13,000 reserve officers and graduates of 
higher educational establishments [VUZ] with military faculties 
will this year receive a notice from their military commissariat 
inviting them to join up for the next two years. The edict on 
their drafting has been signed by the Russian president. This 
was announced to journalists by Colonel General Vladimir 
Semenov, commander in chief of the Ground Forces. 
  More accurately, the notification from the military 
commissariat will be received, of course, by far more than 
13,000 officers -- the Defense Ministry will be choosing who 
will and will not be selected, and not all of those "invited" 
will want to swap their apartments and jobs for a barracks and a 
test range. But, nontheless, the Army is firmly convinced that 
it will get the required number of "reservists" without too much 
difficulty. The situation in the labor market today is such 
that many VUZ graduates cannot put their knowledge to good use. 
They will be more comfortable in the forces. 
  Admittedly, after several years of "vetoing" the drafting of 
"reservists," the Army has been forced into this action. Last 
year 6,623 lieutenants were dismissed from the most widely held 
officers' positions -- platoon and detail commanders -- in the 
Ground Forces alone. This accounted for 45 percent of the total 
number of those discharged, including pensioners. The figure 
for the first quarter of this year is already 1,674. This is 37 
percent. And, despite the fact that 3,000 of the 3,512 
graduates of military colleges will be joining motorized rifle 
units and combined units, there is virtually nobody to educate 
and train the men. The staff shortage in primary officers' 
posts is 17,931. 
  But there is also a shortage of soldiers and NCO's. Subunits 
are almost 50 percent undermanned. This spring the Ground 
Forces should be drafting just 27,000 men, but they need 
260,000. The one hope, say regulars, is for "contract 
servicemen." There are now 82,000 of them in service, and there 
will be another 90,000 this year. And the "professionalization" 
of motorized rifle units will reach 30 percent. 
  The Army is being helped out for the time being by women. 
There are 56,000 of them serving as soldiers and NCO's. This, 
in Gen. Semenov's opinion, will not solve the Ground Forces' 
staffing problems, but it all creates at least some basis for 
maintaining a definite level of military readiness on the part 
of subunits. 
  The Ground Forces' problems are the same as those facing all 
of the Armed Forces. There is no money -- there is a two-three 
month backlog of officers' salaries and a chronic housing 
shortage. There are 51,000 people in motorized rifle and tank 
units without housing, and by the end of this year the figure 
will be 55,000, despite the fact that foreign firms will hand 
over 33,356 apartments by January. The withdrawal of troops 
from abroad, the lack of funds for capital construction, and the 
sharp increase in construction costs will continue to exceed the 
rate at which apartments are obtained. 
  Nonetheless, despite the reduction in its numbers over the 
past few years (the Ground Forces have been reduced by 154,000 
men to currently stand at around 600,000, and generals' 
positions have been halved -- there are now 474 of them), 
Colonel General Semenov is still optimistic. He believes that 
the reforms in his troops, despite everything, are under way, 
and by the time the reforms are complete his units will be 
stronger, more mobile than at present, and prepared to carry out 
any tasks that they are set.

  [Text] Stepanakert, May 23 (SNARK)--Arkadi Gukasyan, 
Karabakh Foreign Minister, refuted the statements of the Baku 
officials that the Karabakh Army destroyed the occupied towns, 
villages, communications and historical monuments on the 
threshold of the negotiations on the Karabakh conflict's 
settlement. 
  In his interview to SNARK Mr. Gukasyan said such statements 
aimed at displaying the Karabakh military forces as barbarous in 
the face of the world community. 
  But the fact is that the Azeris themselves have bombarded 
their towns and villages, said the Minister. Only in Agdam 
there fell more than 300 shells since it has been under the 
control of the Karabakh army. 
  Mr. Gukasyan consider the Azeris have shelled their own 
towns 
seeking to destroy the Karabakh military posts and barracks, 
which they suppose are placed there. 
  Now, when the prospects of a long-termed armistice are very 
real, the Azeri propaganda is trying to conceal its own sins and 
to discredit Karabakh, which only complicates the process of 
negotiations, said Arkadi Gukasyan.

  [Text] Baku, 23 May (ITAR-TASS) -- "The Armenian armed 
forces are perpetrating barbaric acts in the occupied Azeri 
territories, destroying intact residential buildings, 
communications, health care, economic, and other facilities." 
This statement was made today by Azeri State Adviser Vafa 
Gulizade, who was citing reliable sources. He said this 
information was also confirmed by a deserter from the Armenian 
army. 
  Vafa Gulizade informed journalists that the republic's 
president, Geydar Aliyev, appealed to Jan Eliasson, chairman of 
the CSCE Minsk group, and to permanent members of the CSCE, 
asking them to put pressure on Armenia to end acts of vandalism 
by occupying Armenian troops. In the current situation the 
Azeri president has also written to UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali, asking him to inform members of the UN Security 
Council of these developments.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 97 (587) </F>
compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] In President Heydar Aliyev's words, the Azerbaijani 
leadership persistently continues to search for peace in 
Karabakh. 
  As he has reported at a meeting with refugees from that 
region, "consultations are underway with CSCE and Russian 
leaders on a reliable ceasefire and measures to eliminate the 
aftermaths of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict." 
  On the opposition's reaction to Azerbaijan's signing of the 
Bishkek protocol, Aliyev declared: "The leadership did the 
right thing, having signed the accord. For Baku, the protocol 
meant only one thing -- a ceasefire." 
  At the same time, he criticized opposition lawmakers for 
deserting parliament a few days ago and for trying to hold a 
rally in Baku on Saturday. "Instead of organizing rallies and 
other mass protests, political parties should consult 
authorities and be in close touch with them," he stressed. 
  IF Note: Azerbaijan's National Resistance Movement, which 
includes 14 opposition parties, planned a rally on the Freedom 
Square in Baku on Saturday in protest against a possible 
introduction of Russian or CIS troops in Azerbaijan as a force 
that would disengage the Armenian and Azerbaijani troops. 
Nearly one hour before the start of the gathering, the whole 
square was sealed off by up to 1000 policemen, who beat people 
who were on their way to the square with truncheons. By eye 
witnesses accounts, scores of protesters were detained and 
driven by police vans away to an unknown destination. 
  Aliyev reported that lots of cables and telephone calls had 
been coming in the last few days from people across the 
republic, mainly in areas near the front, asking to let them 
come to Baku to crush the opposition. 
  He said the opposition should not fear Russian military 
presence in the republic. "Russian troops will not be 
introduced in Azerbaijan", he assured. 
IF Note: The deployment of a peace force in Karabakh is 
envisaged by a protocol, discussed at a meeting in Moscow last 
week by the Karabakh Army Commander, the defence ministers of 
Armenia and Azerbaijan and their Russian opposite number who 
acted as a mediator at that conference. All but the Azerbaijani 
ministers signed the document. Baku links its signing to the 
conclusion of an agreement on a comprehensive settlement in 
Karabakh, providing for the liberation of the captured 
Azerbaijan lands, the return of refugees, and regional economy 
reconstruction. 
  Talking to an Interfax correspondent, a spokesman for the 
National Independence Party (led by Etibar Mamedov) Rauf 
Mirgadyrov suggested that "by his statement Aliyev has in fact 
made it impossible to come to terms with the opposition."

  [Text] Baku, May 24 (AFP)--Azerbaijani President Geydar 
Aliyev said Tuesday that negotiations with Western oil companies 
for a production-sharing agreement would continue but that 
national interests would be protected. 
  He said the "preservation of Azerbaijan's interests" would 
remain paramount in developing the multi-billion dollar project. 
  Aliyev also moved to reassure members of the western 
consortium hoping to develop two offshore oil fields with 
estimated recoverable oil reserves of 4.4 billion barrels. 
  "We are taking very important and responsible steps in 
preserving the interests of Azerbaijan but the western (oil) 
companies will also benefit," Aliyev said at the opening of the 
International Caspian Oil and Gas Exhibition and conference in 
the Azerbaijani capital Baku. 
  A senior consortium source said Aliyev's speech was "very 
encouraging." 
  The western oil consortium headed by British 
Petroleum/Statoil with 36.7 percent also comprises Amoco (24.3 
percent), Pennzoil Co/Ramco Oil Services (17 percent), Unocal 
Corp (16 percent), McDermott (three percent) and the Turkish 
Petroleum Company (3 percent). 
  The western consortium has been negotiating the production 
sharing agreement with Azerbaijani state oil company SOCAR for 
over three years -- an unusually long time in normal oil 
negotiating terms. The last round of negotiations in Istanbul 
wound up last week without result. 
  Negotiations will resume next month.

<F P=106> [AZERTAC report: "Meeting of the National Assembly"] </F>
  [Text] A regular meeting of the National Assembly was held 
on 18 May. Republic of Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev took 
part in its work. 
  After opening the meeting, Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet of the republic, reported that discussion of the 
drafts of the Laws of the Azerbaijan Republic "On the Commodity 
Exchange" and "On Veterinary Science," and also the question of 
the 1994 budget of the Republic of Azerbaijan had been 
envisioned. However, taking into account various rumors and 
conjectures that were being circulated in the republic after the 
signing of the Bishkek Protocol, and also the appeal of a group 
of deputies, the head of parliament asked the members of the 
National Assembly to express their opinion on the advisability 
of including this question on the meeting agenda. According to 
the speaker, some circles, inciting passions regarding the 
Bishkek Protocol, are pursuing specific objectives and 
attempting to exploit this as a means of attaining power. Rasul 
Guliyev repeated once again that the protocol was in the nature 
of a recommendation. 
  The opinions of the deputies were divided concerning the 
need 
to include the issue of the Bishkek Protocol on the agenda and 
to discuss it at length. 
  Afiyaddin Dzhallilov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet 
of the Republic, who spoke at the meeting and headed the 
Azerbaijani delegation at the Bishkek meeting, presented 
information on the work that had been accomplished in the 
capital of Kyrgyzstan. 
  Jurists Murtuz Aleskerov and Safa Mirzoyev expressed their 
views on the Bishkek Protocol. 
  On the suggestion of Rasul Guliyev, members of the National 
Assembly expressed their position on placing the issue of the 
Bishkek Protocol on the agenda. Nineteen deputies voted "for," 
19 -- "against," and two abstained. Thus, this issue was not 
placed on the agenda of the parliament meeting. 
  After a recess, some of the members of the National Assembly 
once again raised the issue, which aroused a heated discussion. 
Shadman Guseynov read out a statement on behalf of members of 
the National Assembly who came out with a proposal to include 
this issue on the agenda. After this, 13 members of the 
National Assembly walked out of the meeting hall. It was 
proposed to continue the meeting and to express a position with 
respect to the actions of the people's deputies who had walked 
out of the hall. 
  After a short recess, the National Assembly adopted a reply 
statement in which it condemned the actions of the people's 
deputies who had walked out of the meeting hall. 
  With this, the regular meeting of the National Assembly 
concluded its work.

<F P=106> [Regular interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the </F>
Georgian Supreme Council and head of state, by Nato Oniani, date 
and place not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Oniani] The Abkhazian issue was last week's 
main topic because documents connected with the internal 
settlement of the Abkhazian issue were signed. You have said 
that the opposition has to refrain from impeding the authorities 
and offer the authorities an opportunity to complete the process 
of settling the Abkhazian problem. You have also said that a 
lack of hope will lead the country to destruction and that all 
our history has been a struggle for freedom, independence, and 
hope. You have also spoken of a new world order before. In the 
view of what has happened in Georgia recently, including 
Abkhazian events, how practical do you think is the hope that 
we shall be able to settle this problem? 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. Regarding the 
Abkhazian issue, I welcome the fact that our conversation deals 
with this topic. I should say that we have tried all options 
now, and all possibilities have been checked, including the 
military option. I envisage that we are dealing with the optimum 
version of a practical settlement of the issue. I would like to 
say once more that I mean a practical settlement rather than 
plans based on (?reports) and our desires. We have to talk in 
terms of a really practical version. 
  I believe that the return of large streams of refugees will 
begin soon. The main thing is to get this process started. I 
think this will happen very soon. And I request everyone once 
again not to pose obstacles to us. The authorities -- and all 
of Georgia -- are entrusted with such a large and crucial 
mission today that we all have to be concerned that no 
additional difficulties are created and no additional 
destructive processes take place regardless of whether we agree 
with this path or not. Especially if a beneficial trend is 
evident, and I am confident that this will be the case. 
Proceeding from the common interest, those who do not trust us 
-- and there are quite understandable reasons for such people to 
exist -- should take at least a neutral position, at least at 
this stage. It will be different if we face failure. 
  I would say that the very existence of Georgia is connected 
with the refugee problem. This is how we are dealing with it. 
I request the refugees, in the first place, not to give in to 
individual politicians who are guided by certain ambitions or a 
certain grudge, or who believe only in the efficiency of a 
variant they are proposing. Do not give in to those who call 
for an adventurous way. This may prove fatal. I am well aware 
of their possibilities, and I know that no one is capable of 
proposing a more practical version of the settlement than the 
existing one. This is especially so since important decisions 
pertaining to this issue will be taken in New York very soon. 
  A military team, who are to plan the deployment of the 
peacekeeping forces, and who in fact have already planned it, 
have left Moscow for New York. The sequence and stages will be 
made clear in a week or 10 days time, and then the process will 
begin. We have had a constant link with New York, and, no matter 
what, the population will be provided with complete information. 
  The return of Abkhazia and the return to Abkhazia depends of 
course on our joining the CIS, on engaging in new relations with 
Russia, and these were purposeful and considered steps. This 
also depends on our good relations with all states of the world, 
including the permanent members of the UN Security Council. 
These are the United States, England, France, our friend the 
Federal Republic of Germany, and other countries that have been 
supporting us. All this depends on close cooperation within the 
UN framework. And this is a sign of the new order I have talked 
about. All I said does not have anything to do with playing a 
double game. Some people have fixed ideas, and they believe 
that the only truth is what they think. Is it a double game to 
begin establishing good relations with Russia, Ukraine, and 
other neighboring countries and maintain good relations with the 
West at the same time when they grant assistance in order to 
relieve our major pain? 
  [Oniani] Two parties walked out of the council session last 
week: the Republican Party and Merab Kostava Society. You also 
did not attend Supreme Council sessions last week. Can we 
interpret this as your boycotting the Supreme Council? 
  [Shevardnadze] And do you think that we had a preliminary 
agreement? [both laugh] I can honestly say that walking out of 
the Supreme Council is a very regrettable event by itself, 
regardless of what group or what person does it. Those elected 
by the people shall leave the council by the permission of the 
people. Whatever the suffering and difficulties connected with 
sitting there, one must be able to manage it. 
  As for my occasional absence from council sessions, this is 
caused by urgent affairs, and I am sometimes forced to resort to 
this sort of protest. I mean not to attend the council sessions 
especially when I know that it means involvement in aimless 
debates. 
  There have been demands that the post of head of state 
should 
be abolished, but, since we have already mentioned this topic, I 
would say that I cannot imagine how we could survive without 
this post at the present stage. Thus, no matter what we want, 
we have to adapt to reality. We have to listen less to those 
who are not in the know. For some of them, the worse the 
better. Therefore, at the present stage, I reiterate, it is 
fully justified to combine the posts of head of state and 
chairman of the Supreme Council. I am convinced of this by my 
own experience. And if I sometimes cannot be seen in the 
Supreme Council, this should by no means be regarded as 
disregard or disrespect toward the council. God forbid. 
  [Oniani] Georgia will be celebrating the 75th anniversary 
of Tbilisi State University next week from 23 to 25 May. This is 
an important occasion for our country. It was a deplorable 
state of affairs in our science that you spoke about during your 
meeting with the known financier and philanthropist George 
Soros. How can the establishment of an independent, 
international, social organization -- Georgia Open Social 
Foundation -- help manage these processes? 
  [Shevardnadze] I believe that yesterday was a very important 
day. Especially because it was close to the university 
celebrations. The Soros Foundation is a very important and 
serious international creation, and Mr. Soros himself is an 
unbelievably interesting and very fruitful -- if you will, or 
rather, efficient -- figure in the world. He has been doing 
great things. [passage omitted] The foundation has already done 
significant things for Georgia. It is probably not a very large 
number, but 200 to 250 scientists have been practically 
cooperating with the foundation. Many of them have received 
grants from the foundations, and others are nominated to receive 
them. Some young people are getting an education under the 
sponsorship of the foundation in various countries. However, 
since yesterday, since the opening of the center of the 
foundation and its branch in Tbilisi, the activities will 
acquire a more purposeful and planned character. [passage 
omitted] 
  George Soros has an incredibly rich experience and a very 
well ordered brain, if you will. I think some models we 
discussed yesterday may be useful for us in order to overcome 
the crisis even faster. We have reached very interesting ideas. 
His recommendations are very original, and Georgia may even 
become a basis for certain experimentation. I do not want to 
exaggerate the significance of this conversation, but I would 
say that it was a useful conversation from the conceptual point 
of view. I have told him what the Georgian authorities are 
intending to do regarding the coupon, the national currency, and 
privatization. 
  I have been thinking long about the process of 
privatization. 
We have to deal with privatization of not only land but also 
industry, construction, and trade, and I do not rule out that my 
edict pertaining to this process -- to speeding up the process 
-- will be issued very soon. [passage omitted] 
  [Oniani] Batono Eduard, the 26 May celebrations [Georgian 
Independence Day] are coming this week. Notwithstanding various 
contradictions and differences in the approach to this issue, 
Georgia will be celebrating. Something is said to be prepared 
for this day. Those who we often mention as certain forces, 
because names of many of them are well known to the official 
bodies who have to know, intend to do something, are preparing 
more disturbances. How well is the population of the city 
secured from this sort of a surprise, if you will? 
  [Shevardnadze] The 26 May holiday is a day of statehood. We 
are heading in this direction, although at a speed slower than 
desired. Opponents can say that there is no state, that the 
state has disintegrated, and so on. This was the case two or 
three years ago. The times were very hard. But now, the state 
is being formed. [passage omitted] Party differences and 
contradictions should not blind us. I do not think that any 
party will attempt to torment the population on this day. 
  You said that there are rumors about some disturbances. I am 
not sure what reports we have, but I do believe no one should 
attempt to create new sources of instability in the capital city 
on this day. All sound people have to this rule out. On the 
contrary, everyone has to try to secure a demonstration of our 
unity and integrity at least on this day. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking of rumors about some disturbances, I think everyone 
will have sufficient prudence and sense of responsibility not to 
repeat past errors. I want to reiterate that Georgia's 
Independence Day and the university anniversary, which has been 
planned to coincide with Independence Day -- and was therefore 
shifted -- deserve being celebrated by all of us together so 
that we all together demonstrate readiness to serve our country, 
our state. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Georgian opposition is actively utilizing the 
Abkhazian problem in the fight against Shevardnadze. 
  [Maravava] If Eduard Shevardnadze does not resign by 26 May, 
then on Georgian independence day the Georgian people should 
demonstrate for the resignation of the head of state. This 
statement was made by Irakliy Tsereteli, the leader of the 
National Independence Party. The idea of holding a protest 
action has been supported by several other opposition parties. 
  Today the republic's internal political life is like a time 
bomb. The agreement on Abkhazia signed in Moscow on 14 May has 
caused an explosion of indignation in the parliamentary 
opposition. Demands for the head of state's resignation 
followed immediately, as did calls for a boycott of parliament 
sessions until the institution of head of state is abolished and 
an exclusively parliamentary form of government adopted. 
  Boris Kakubava, the leader of the Abkhazian Liberation 
Union, 
has appealed to the Georgian Supreme Court to instigate 
proceedings against Shevardnadze as a traitor to his country. 
Thus, the opposition has set off along the path of radical 
struggle. 
  As regards the majority it is in full battle readiness, and 
is calling for a boycott of supreme legislative body sessions, 
accusing the opposition of trying to drag Georgia into chaos and 
war. 
  The head of state himself, in regard to Georgian statehood 
day, today appealed to all political forces to make the maximum 
effort to achieve unity and accord and not put narrow party 
interests ahead of state interests.

  [Text] As has already been reported, in connection with 
the unconstitutional and illegal decisions by the Crimean 
Supreme Soviet regarding the peninsula's status, Ukrainian 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko sent letters to foreign 
ministers of other countries and leaders of foreign 
organizations. The international community, alarmed by a 
negative development of events possible in the Crimea, voices 
its unequivocal support for the position expressed in the letter 
by the Ukrainian foreign minister. 
  Anatoliy Zlenko today received William Miller, U.S. 
ambassador to Ukraine, at his request. The American diplomat 
handed over to Mr. Zlenko a personal message from U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher which, in particular, noted that the 
United States recognizes and highly praises Ukraine's 
responsible and peaceful position on the developments in the 
Crimea. In response to destabilizing processes in the Crimea, 
Ukraine acts according to high principles of the CSCE, with 
which all of us seek to comply. Any other actions could lead to 
confrontation, which would not suit the interests of all sides. 
The United States, the message emphasized, supports the 
sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine 
in its present borders. The United States seeks to expand and 
deepen relations with Ukraine, and would like to move forward 
quickly in assisting Ukraine through economic incentive programs 
that would be useful for the whole country, including the Crimea.

  [Text] The German Foreign Affairs Ministry has circulated a 
statement by Foreign Affairs Minister Klaus Kinkel. It stresses 
that the Federal Government is watching the recent developments 
in Crimea with concern. Ukraine's territorial integrity and 
independence that are necessary for stability and peaceful 
relations in Europe cannot be called into doubt, the statement 
emphasizes. The German Federal Government hopes that all 
interested political forces are aware of the importance of 
principled obligations within the CSCE, and the unconditional

  [Text] On 24 May, Ukrainian Ambassador to Moldova Vitaliy 
Boyko met Moldova's Deputy Foreign Minister (Osmochescu) and 
handed him a letter from the Ukrainian foreign minister on 
Ukraine's stance regarding the Crimean issue. The minister 
pointed out that Moldova, which has suffered from the policy of 
separatism, fully realizes the threat posed by the actions of 
Crimean power structures; entirely supports the Ukrainian 
leadership, denounces separatism, and supports Ukraine's 
unconditional territorial integrity. Mr. (Osmochescu) assured 
the ambassador that the Moldovan leadership would support 
Ukraine's position with regard to denouncing separatism at all 
levels, both within the CIS borders and in the international 
arena.

Crimean question. This was reported on Monday [23 May] to 
INTERFAX-Ukraine by the head of the information department of 
the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Yuriy Sergeyev. 
  Commenting on the statement of a political advisor of the

Crimean question to be discussed at the UN, Sergeyev expressed 
surprise at how she could have come to such a conclusion. 
  He stressed that the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy

  [Text] By 30 May, U.S. strategic and ballistic missiles 
will no longer be targeted at Ukraine. As a reminder, this 
decision was reached at the Ukrainian-U.S. negotiations in 
Washington on 11-14 May 1994. In those days, the Ukrainian 
Government delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy 
Shmarov discussed with the American side a wide range of issues 
related to nonproliferation of missile systems carrying mass 
destruction weapons, development of the trilateral process in 
the sphere of nuclear disarmament, and mutual cooperation in 
rocket and space industry, etc. Our correspondent, Viktor Bak, 
interviewed Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov. 
  [Begin recording] [Bak] During your visit to the United 
States, the delegation that you headed also discussed the issue 
of cooperation in the sphere of conversion. 
  [Shmarov] You know that the Ukrainian Government and the 
U.S. 
Administration set up a joint conversion commission. On the 
American side, it is headed by U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
Perry, and on the Ukrainian side, by Machine Building Minister 
Chernenko. This commission has been quite busy (?since last 
fall). The commission has pinpointed about 30 projects. We 
examined those projects together with the United States. At 
present, interested partners are being sought. What are these 
partners for? First, the United States does not have sufficient 
funds to finance this program -- a small amount was earmarked 
for the conversion. We seek to attract the private capital of 
American entrepreneurs and companies. In practical terms, 
selection of partners and signing of projects will probably be 
carried out in July. We have determined the terms for one pilot 
project, which is a joint venture of the well-known U.S. company 
Westinghouse and Ukraine's Hartron. Hartron is an enterprise 
that was oriented toward developing rocket industry products, 
currently subject to the conversion plan. So, we envision that 
it would be engaged in developing safety and control systems for 
nuclear power plants. As you know, this is a major problem for 
us today. This project has been signed. The U.S. Government 
allocated $5 million for this project, while Westinghouse 
designated $20 million [words indistinct], and we offer our 
production and scientific resources. I think that this project 
will assume realistic [word indistinct]. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] The Crimean issue can be resolved only if Ukraine's 
integrity and the territory's status remain unchanged, President 
Leonid Kravchuk said speaking on the eve of a meeting between 
Ukrainian and Crimean legislators in Kiev on Tuesday. He hopes 
for comprise to be achieved. 
  Ukraine's statehood and integrity is the drawing line which 
no one including Crimea is allowed to cross, Kravchuk said. 
  He called for a status quo that existed before last Friday 
when the Crimean parliament passed a resolution to restore the 
republic's constitution of May 6, 1992 which provides for 
greater regional autonomy and dual citizenship to the Crimeans. 
IF Note: On the same day, the Ukrainian parliament vetoed down 
the decision by Crimean legislators who had in turn suspended 
Kiev's resolution a day after. 
  For his own part, Kravchuk said Kiev's decision would 
automatically become null and void as soon as the Crimean 
parliament suspended its resolution of May 20. 
  The Crimean delegation flying out to Kiev on Tuesday wants 
three main issues to be put on the agenda of talks there -- dual 
citizenship, economic and financial matters (a banking union 
between Crimea and Russia) and armed forces, one source close to 
the Crimean parliament told Interfax. 
  He said that although Simferopol did not bank on a complete 
breakthrough in the talks, it was sending a delegation to Kiev 
to avoid further confrontation and build up bridges with Ukraine. 
  In the meantime, Speaker of the Crimean Parliament Sergey 
Tsekov is convinced that the Supreme Soviet had to restore the 
1992 constitution as the only and softest option for regulating 
Simferopol's relations with Ukraine. 
  He admitted that the ruling Russia alliance's final goal was 
to gain independence from Ukraine and unify with Russia. Tsekov 
does not rule out the possibility of reunification with Russia 
together with Ukraine. 
  Tsekov hopes that more sensible Ukrainian leaders will not 
allow a souring of relations with Crimea. 
  Asked if the Crimean parliament had gone a bit too far in 
its 
demands for greater autonomy, Kravchuk said it would have to toe 
the line. 
IF Note: Chief presidential advisor for domestic policies 
Nikolay Mikhalchenko said Kravchuk may ask parliament for 
appropriate powers to ensure the country's sovereignty and 
integrity as guarantor of the constitution if Simferopol failed 
to rescind its decision. However, he declined to say whether 
this meant the imposition of presidential rule or declaration of 
a state of emergency in Crimea. 
  Kravchuk said that Kiev's position outlined by Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Zlenko's appeal to other countries "has found 
full understanding throughout the world". This also includes 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev whom he quoted as saying 
recently that "Russia will never raise the question of Ukraine's 
integrity". 
  Kravchuk said the country's integrity was laid down in a 
bilateral agreement between Kiev and Moscow as well as a joint 
statement signed by the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and U.S. 
  Russian and Ukrainian Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin 
and 
Yefim Zvyagilsky meet in Moscow on Monday to discuss the 
situation around Crimea and how to defuse tension between Kiev 
and Simferopol. The meeting follows last Friday's telephone 
conversation between Presidents Yeltsin and Kravchuk. Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev says that the talks in Moscow 
must focus on respect for human rights (above all, the right to 
a peaceful life) as well as for self-determination but with 
understanding that "Crimea is a sovereign republic within 
Ukraine". 
IF Note: Yeltsin spoke of receiving assurances from the 
Ukrainian leader during last Friday's telephone conversation 
that Kiev would refrain from using force to try to resolve the 
dispute. 
  But a senior member of Kravchuk's office in an interview 
with 
Interfax criticized Yeltsin's statement. 
  He said that "Ukraine is an independent state and the 
methods 
it chooses to use for resolving internal conflicts depend 
exclusively on the will of its people and parliament. 
Undoubtedly, these will be in line with the Ukrainian 
constitution and laws. Ukraine will always go by international 
law". 
  The official spoke of being surprised at Yeltsin's statement 
saying that "it is important that neither Russia nor Ukraine 
meddle in Crimean affairs". He said that one may well infer 
that Russia wanted the same status in relations with Crimea as 
Ukraine of which Crimea was part. 
  Some reports say Prime Minister Zvyagilsky may meet the 
Russian leader if he and his Russian counterpart Viktor 
Chernomyrdin have made a breakthrough in Monday's talks in 
Moscow.

  [Excerpts] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has paid a 
working visit to the town of Pervomaysk in Nikolayev Oblast. 
Our correspondent Vitaliy Naumenko, reports. [passage omitted] 
  [Naumenko] Considering the large number of complex problems 
facing the Ukrainian people today that demand urgent solutions, 
the president of Ukraine had to answer many questions. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Leonid 
Makarovych, a question from Ukrainian Radio. I would not like 
to talk about serious issues on this festive day, but obviously 
everyone's thoughts today go to Crimea. How will you comment on 
the further course of developments? 
  [Kravchuk] We made this decision: As soon as the Crimean 
Parliament revokes the law it passed, the Supreme Council will 
also suspend its' resolution. Thus, it is all up to the Supreme 
Council of Crimea. Once it revokes the law, the Supreme Council 
of Ukraine will revoke its respective resolution. 
  I hope that the delegation formed by the Supreme Council of 
Crimea will arrive in Kiev and, I hope, we will find a solution, 
but the solution must go one way: No change in the status, no 
change in Ukraine's territorial integrity. Within the framework 
of this process, the process of finding mutual understanding, 
there should be no change in status and territorial integrity. 
If this is taken as a point of reference, we will find any, I 
stress, any solution. But integrity and statehood is the bottom 
line, which nobody is allowed to cross. [words indistinct] 
  [Correspondent] Do you think the Crimean Parliament has gone 
too far in its claims against Ukraine's territorial integrity? 
  [Kravchuk] I think, wherever it has gone it will return. 
Because such will be the necessary legal action taken by 
Ukraine, and not only Ukraine. I am informed that our foreign 
minister has addressed the world, explaining our stance, and 
that our stance has been met with full support for Ukraine's 
territorial integrity and inviolability of borders. The world 
has recognized Ukraine, recognized our right and our stance. 
Incidentally, this is confirmed by the foreign minister [words 
indistinct]. Russia is not disputing the issue of our 
territorial integrity. This is understandable -- that it cannot 
dispute what has been recognized by the entire world and 
endorsed in the treaty between Russia and Ukraine of 1990, and 
in the trilateral agreement signed in Moscow by the presidents 
of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think that, unfortunately, our 
colleagues, journalists from Ostankino television company, are 
being somewhat aggressive in their constant...I don't even know 
what to call it.... 
  [Kravchuk] I hope we don't have to pay attention to 
Ostankino, and this would be our best step; but despite its 
being so, I don't know what to call it [word indistinct] is 
being worked up. Also, by the way, if one is to blame someone 
for something, I don't want to generalize, then one must recall 
the coverage of the Transdniester events, the coverage of the 
(Karabakh) events, the coverage of the events in Georgia, 
Abkhazia, and now even in Ukraine and Crimea, all this coverage 
can be described as one thing: Conscious instigation of 
confrontation between the people. If this is the goal of 
Ostankino or of those behind it, this goal may be reached in 
Ostankino's view, but not in the view of the people who do not 
believe it, who, I am sure, have stopped believing these 
untruths. [end recording]

  [Text] The President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov said on local 
television on Monday that any stabilization of relations between 
Crimea and Ukraine is out of the question as long as the 
political aggression by Kiev continues. 
  Speaking of the Tuesday [24 May] meeting of the 
parliamentary 
delegations of Ukraine and Crimea in Kiev he voiced hope for its 
fruitfulness. Unlike the executive branch of power, Meshkov 
said, the Ukrainian parliament has not taken steps violating the 
constitution. 
  Answering a question about the most favorable and the most 
unfavorable course of developments the president said:"The most 
favorable forecast is that we will resolve our problems over the 
holiday season, the most unfavorable -- the refusal of Russia to 
be involved in the settlement of the Crimean problem." 
  At the same time he said that the last option is so 
improbable that there is no need to worry. 
  Answering a question about the possible reaction of the 
Crimean administration to the use of force by Kiev Meshkov said 
the steps of the Crimean leadership are clearly regulated by the 
Crimean Constitution and laws.

  [Text] According to the press service of the Crimean 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, 29 APCs arrived on Sunday at 
Simferopol train station. After unloading, the APCs headed for 
the territory of the Simferopol military school, escorted by 
Crimean highway inspection officers. 
  Colonel Oleksandr Kostyukov, commander of the National Guard 
brigade, confirmed in an interview for UKRINFORM that the APC's 
did arrive. He said: However, they are not for the military 
school but for our subunits. Their arrival accidentally 
coincided with the developments in the wake of the decision by 
the Crimean Supreme Council session to restore the Constitution 
of 6 May 1993. In reality, it was part of a scheduled process 
of equipping the brigade.

discussed at a meeting held by the medzhlis of the Crimean 
Tatars in Simferopol. A resolution was adopted on the threat of 
an armed conflict in the Crimea. The resolution points out the

institutions of the Crimean Tatars should comply with the norms 
of international law, the Ukrainian Constitution and its laws, 
and the decisions by the kurultay and the medzhlis of the 
Crimean Tatars. All necessary measures have to be taken to 
prevent our countrymen from getting embroiled in a standoff with 
the Ukrainian state, the resolution by the medzhlis of the

  [Text] The Ukrainian Interior Ministry has called on the 
Crimean leadership to reconsider its decision to transfer local 
law-enforcement bodies to Crimean jurisdiction. According to a 
statement of the ministry collegium distributed Monday [23 May], 
Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov "exceeded his powers and 
actively interfered in the activities of the law-enforcement 
bodies." 
  "Yuriy Meshkov's decree to remove A. Plyuta as Crimean 
interior minister and appoint Valeriy Kuznetsov as acting 
minister was made unilaterally, without coordination with the 
Ukrainian Interior Ministry, breaching the Ukrainian 
Constitution and the law on power-sharing between state power 
bodies of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic," the document stated. 
  According to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, "a 
destabilization of the general situation can be seen in Crimea, 
the number of serious crimes, often with the use of firearms 
continues to grow." In the meantime, Crimean police units are 
used to guard radio and television broadcasting installations 
allegedly planned to be seized by Kiev instead of preventing and 
investigating crimes, the document said. 
  The authors of the statement assess Kuznetsov's actions to 
ensure the safety of people as "unprofessional and inadequate 
considering the criminal situation in Crimea." The Ukrainian 
Interior Ministry collegium put all responsibility for what is 
going on in Crimea and its unpredictable consequences on 
Kuznetsov and those forces, which created the conditions for 
this situation.

  [Text] On Monday [23 May] the Ukrainian parliamentary 
delegation to the talks with the Crimean parliament held a 
session in private in Kiev. The head of the delegation Boris 
Oleynik refused to disclose the approach of Kiev to the 
negotiations. "I have gone through 25 different conflicts and 
know what these comments lead to," he told INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  Oleynik, a prominent poet, before the collapse of the Soviet 
Union was deputy chairman of the House of Nationalities of the 
USSR Supreme Soviet. 
  He said he also banned commentaries on the situation by all 
members of his delegation. So far it is only known that the 
final list of delegates will be announced late on Monday evening. 
  The Crimean delegation is expected to arrive in Kiev at 
about 
1100 on Tuesday. The same day it intends to return to 
Simferopol.

  [Text] The situation in Crimea is largely calm, RIA was 
told by (Petr Chernichevich), an advisor to the Crimean 
president on military issues. However, he said that some 
tension could nevertheless be sensed, caused by the 
unpredictability of the Ukrainian authorities' next moves. 
  Reinforcements are constantly arriving at the Ukrainian 
National Guard units in Simferopol and Sevastopol. The number 
of guards has already reached 2,000, consisting mainly of men 
from western Ukraine who arrived in Simferopol on Sunday. They 
have also received 29 armored personnel carriers, according to 
Chernichevich. 
  All important sites in the Crimean capital remain under the 
strict guard of interior troop units loyal to the Crimean 
Government, and the city's streets are being patrolled by 
Crimean Cossacks.

  [Text] Simferopol, 22 May -- Leonid Hrach, first secretary 
of the Crimean Communist Party Central Committee, secretary of 
the Ukrainian Communist Party Central Committee and deputy to 
the Crimean Supreme Council in a multiseat district, gave a news 
conference. He informed journalists that the Crimean Communist 
Party Central Committee issued a statement which calls renewal 
of the Republic of Crimea's 6 May 1992 Constitution 
"inappropriate to the present time and allows dishonorable 
leaders in Ukraine, Crimea, and Russia to inflame interethnic 
hostility and a bloody conflict." 
  Leonid Hrach noted at the news conference that the Crimean 
Communist Party is ready to cooperate with any political forces 
in order to unite efforts against inflaming conflicts and to 
speak out in favor of civic peace and interethnic accord. 
According to Leonid Hrach, the actions of Crimea's Supreme 
Council in adopting the first version of the 6 May 1992 
Constitution and suspending the Ukrainian Supreme Council's 
resolution revoking the Republic of Crimea's resolution renewing 
the constitutional basis of the Republic of Crimea's statehood, 
are criminal.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Golts, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA observer, commentary under </F>
the general heading: "Crimea: Up Along a Conflict Spiral. 
Will Politicians Stop at the Line of Danger?"] 
  [Text] Reports about troops being deployed and moved up... 
Attempts to seize and to resubordinate power agencies and 
government authorities... Finally, menacing statements and 
their refutations, a growing snowball of mutual accusations. 
Later, when the irremediable happens, they will all claim that 
no one wanted bloodshed and all struggled for sovereignty... 
  The situation that is coming about in Crimea appears very 
complex. I would like to believe that the worst forecasts will 
not come true, that the latest contacts between the Russian and 
Ukrainian presidents will help ease the tension. However, 
anyone who can recall how conflicts flared up in various 
independent state states on the territory of the former USSR 
cannot but be alerted by the degree to which the situation in 
Crimea is reminiscent of what preceded bloody and lengthy wars 
in Karabakh, Abkhazia, and the Dniester Region. 
  This is a perfectly familiar scenario. It is beginning to 
unfold each time the legislatures of various autonomous entities 
decide to stop obeying the center's commands. As a rule, this 
happens against the backdrop of overall political instability in 
the state as a whole. And each time it plays into the hands of 
a politician who defends his power in a fierce struggle. He 
sends troops and special-purpose units, starts threatening the 
"separatists" with force. 
  All this ends similarly -- in blood. One cannot but ask: 
Are all those who call themselves leaders really so out if it 
that they are unable to make balanced, reasonable decisions (as 
a matter of fact, there is one precedent, albeit a unique one, 
where Moscow was wise enough not to forcibly impose its 
authority on Chechnya)? 
  I think that the reason lies elsewhere: They simply think 
that they can always fall back, stop at the line of danger after 
upping the ante as much as possible and hitting the jackpot. 
One always has the feeling that those who tried to take a 
similar gamble in Abkhazia, Karabakh, and the Dniester Region 
were simply not slick or lucky enough to succeed. And this is 
the main mistake. The thing is that politicians are not 
starting a boxing match that can be stopped any minute. They 
set in motion large masses of armed people whose nerves are 
strained to the limit. And they simply fail some people. A 
minor bureaucrat, misunderstanding a command, wholeheartedly 
rushes to carry it out; an armored personnel carrier or simply 
an office car might run over a casual passer-by, or a live 
cartridge might be carelessly put in the chamber of someone's 
automatic rifle. 
  Such accidents have long become a rule in "hot spots." 
Whenever they occur, conflicts begin to escalate by themselves, 
an escalation that cannot be stopped by anyone. Moreover, if a 
conflict flares up in Crimea, all we have seen earlier will pale 
in scale alongside it. The reason is that the Black Sea Fleet, 
which has never been split, will undoubtedly be drawn into it. 
  This threshold has not been crossed yet. We ought to do our 
utmost to prevent this from happening.

  [Text] The Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists believes the 
Ukrainian president and Supreme Council should introduce 
presidential rule in Crimea and repeal its autonomous status. 
This was said in a statement the congress made regarding the 
latest developments in Crimea. The document stresses that the 
Crimean Supreme Council's decision to restore the autonomy's 
constitution in its original version represents disregard for 
the fundamental law of Ukraine and international agreements on 
the inviolability of the borders and territorial integrity of 
states. The statement's authors describe these actions as 
criminal in respect of the Ukrainian people and state. 
  The Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists also demands that the 
registration in Crimea of political parties, which perform 
anti-Ukrainian activity, should be discontinued, separatism 
ended, and calm and peaceful work guaranteed for the peninsula's 
citizens.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Pasyakin, Sergey Prokopenko, and </F>
Anatoliy Polyakov: "Clear Weather in the Crimea for Now, But 
the Barometer Is Inclining Toward the `Storm' Mark. Politics Is 
Not A Weather Forecast. There Must Be No Mistake"] 
  [Excerpt] The situation in the Crimea remains rather 
complex. Let us recall that the political situation here has 
exacerbated in recent days in connection with the adoption by 
the Republic of Crimea parliament of a law on the restoration of 
the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992, which provides for great 
autonomy for the peninsula in relations with Ukraine. This step 
has been assessed in official Kiev as separatism and a threat to 
Ukraine's territorial integrity. A number of pretty 
hard-hitting statements ensued. A "war of edicts" has begun, 
whereby Kiev revokes the Crimean Supreme Council's decisions and 
the Crimean parliamentarians react "appropriately" to Kiev's 
decisions. 
  On the morning of 23 May General Major Valeriy Kuznetsov, 
minister of internal affairs of the Republic of Crimea, 
commented on the situation for KRASNAYA ZVEZDA as follows: 
  "The outward situation is calm, but people are tense in view 
of the ambiguity of the situation. What is needed is for 
everything to be decided at a political level, for us, a power 
structure, not to get dragged into political squabbles, and for 
the opinion of the people to be heeded, including that of 
officers of the internal affairs organs. The national guard's 
forces are continuing to grow in the Crimea." 
  It has become known that at 2300 hours on 22 May, 12 
railroad 
flatcars arrived in Simferopol carrying 29 Ukrainian Army 
armored personnel carriers. The armored vehicles were dispersed 
in various parts of the city. A report to this effect was made 
by Petr Chernyatevich, the Crimean president's adviser on 
military questions. 
  In his words, on the same day yet another attempt was made 
to 
get into the Crimean MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] building 
by a group of Ukrainian MVD officers who, according to the 
directive of their minister, had been appointed to various 
leading posts in place of their Crimean colleagues. However, 
the building's guards prevented this. [passage omitted]

Viktor Yadukha report from Simferopol with the general heading: 
"Russian, Ukrainian Heads of Government Wait for Yevgeniy 
Saburov. Russia Ready To Discuss Crimean Issue at the UN"] 
  [Text] Russia's head of government, Viktor Chernomyrdin, 
and his first deputy, Oleg Soskovets, proposed to Ukrainian 
acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy that talks on the Black 
Sea Fleet and the status of Crimea be continued today. Earlier 
it was expected that the talks would end on Monday [23 May]. 
However, according to information received by SEGODNYA, the 
need arose during the meeting for Crimean Deputy Prime Minister 
Yevgeniy Saburov to attend the talks; yesterday afternoon he 
flew to Moscow. 
  On Monday, Mr. Chernomyrdin suggested during the meeting 
that 
his Ukrainian counterpart himself outline the range of problems 
to be discussed. Yefim Zvyagilskiy named as two priority 
matters the split of the Black Sea Fleet and the basing of the 
Russian part of the fleet. The official talks were preceded by 
a one-hour private meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian 
prime ministers. 
  Russia "does not object" to a consideration of the Crimean 
issue by the United Nations, Galina Sidorova, political adviser 
to the Russian Foreign Minister, said after Mr. Kozyrev's 
meeting with his British counterpart, Douglas Hurd. Meanwhile, 
presidential chief of staff Sergey Filatov told ITAR-TASS that 
"the ratcheting up of tensions in Crimea is advantageous only to 
irresponsible politicians in Ukraine who would like to exploit 
an emergency situation in the region to postpone presidential 
elections and to hold on to power." 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  Yevgeniy Saburov, deputy prime minister of the Republic of 
Crimea, said in a conversation with your SEGODNYA correspondent 
that at a time of inflation Kiev has given "yet another batch of 
newly printed money" to all regions except Crimea. This amounts 
to an economic blockade, which began after they stopped giving 
credits for the peninsula's agriculture. "It seems natural to 
us that Russia, not an overseas power, should assume the 
function of a mediator," he emphasized. 
  In the meantime, a pro-Kiev organization, the Civil Council 
of Crimea, which calls itself an opposition parliament, held a 
constituent conference in Crimea while talks were under way in 
Russia. The council's constituent documents say that "groups of 
citizens will select persons loyal to Ukraine from among members 
of political organizations." The opposition parliament plans 
"to counter separatism and to take efforts to protect and uphold 
the status of Crimea as part of Ukraine."

<F P=106> [Vitaliy Portnikov report in the "Ukraine" column: "Will </F>
Aleksandr Moroz Become a `Ukrainian Rybkin'? Victory by the 
Socialist Leader Has Been Forecast"] 
  [Text] Observers in Kiev increasingly tend to compare 
Aleksandr Moroz, newly elected Supreme Soviet chairman, to 
Russian State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin: evolution, they imply, 
is inevitable, and the political transformation that has 
occurred with the State Duma chairman will also happen to the 
Ukraine parliament speaker. Especially since their political 
backgrounds are so similar: neither Moroz nor Rybkin succeeded 
in the upper echelons of the old party nomenklatura, and both 
became leaders of left forces when their former leaders, who had 
top-level approval, grew disillusioned with these forces. The 
Moroz case is especially indicative: he entered big-time 
politics when it began to seem to party leaders that a 
"grassroots" deputy was needed to play the role of a party 
faction organizer while the real orchestrators were to stay in 
the shadows, but after the Ukraine Communist Party was banned, 
the former majority leader not only did not sit in the shadows 
but launched vigorous efforts to rescue the left forces which at 
the time appeared marginal: this was how the Ukraine Socialist 
Party emerged which appeared to be communist until a real 
Ukraine Communist Party came along. 
  Both during the years of his leadership in the notorious 
"Group of 239" and after the emergence of the Socialist Party 
Aleksandr Moroz really showed himself as a fairly flexible, 
open-minded and often pragmatic politician: as is known, when a 
person is elected to a high post, such qualities only grow. 
Moroz, however, is a representative of a small faction, owing 
his success primarily to support from communists. Still the 
lineup of forces in the Ukraine Supreme Soviet is unlike in 
Russia's, and Ivan Rybkin has considerably more room for 
maneuver than Aleksandr Moroz. Especially since an argument in 
favor of Rybkin's flexibility is a strong president. And what 
is the argument in favor of Moroz' flexibility? Presidential 
elections? 
  The very first days of the new parliament showed that 
Aleksandr Moroz will have to repay the debts to the strongest 
faction in the Supreme Soviet. When he was already enjoying the 
position of a virtual head of parliament, presiding over its 
session which discussed the fate of deputies elected in 
uncontested constituencies, Moroz behaved rather tactlessly, in 
a partisan manner, with respect to a leader in the Interregional 
Reforms Bloc, Vladimir Grinev, and yet another deputy from the 
non-left camp, Pavel Kudyukin. A new scandal emerged after 
Moroz was elected Supreme Council chairman: the opposition 
wrecked the session, apparently fearing that Communist Party 
representatives would be elected deputy speakers. 
  The realignment of forces in the new Supreme Council is 
strikingly reminiscent of the situation that existed in the 
first days of the old, still very Soviet, parliament: the left 
can do everything but the opposition can thwart a session. 
Therefore agreement will have to be reached with it. However 
the aggravated situation around Crimea and the need to resolve 
the fate of the upcoming 26 presidential elections, whose 
cancellation is so actively sought by Leonid Kravchuk, could 
prevent the opposition from boycotting parliament indefinitely. 
Agreement may have to reached immediately, in haste, and only 
temporarily: that is, of course, unless Aleksandr Moroz 
transforms into an Ivan Rybkin faster that the parliamentary 
balance of forces allows him to.

<F P=106> [N. Gavrileva report on news conference given by Sergey </F>
Tsekov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Crimea; place and date 
not given: "We Are Working Without Fanfare"] 
  [Text] The corps of journalists of Crimea welcomes 
the endeavor of Sergey Tsekov, the new chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet of Crimea, to continue the former tradition of holding a 
news conference following the completion of a stage of work of 
the Supreme Soviet. Sergey Pavlovich held his first important 
meeting with journalists during a lengthy break in the work of 
the first session, when it had become possible to speak about 
the fully formed leadership of the Crimean parliament. 
<H5>  Work of Parliament </H5>
  [Question] Please assess the three days of business of the 
session. 
  [Tsekov] I believe that the Supreme Soviet spent them 
entirely productively, the plan which had been mapped out by the 
action committee was fulfilled, the leadership elected, and the 
presidium formed--all without undue shouting and clamor, calmly, 
and in balanced fashion. I evaluate the makeup of the 
commissions positively also; the professional level of the 
deputies is quite high, and they are ready for work. 
  [Question] When will the session continue? 
  [Tsekov] The plenary sitting will open on 20 May; work in 
the 
commissions is under way at this time. 
  [Question] What will be predominant in parliament's 
work--party or factional discipline? 
  [Tsekov] I believe that factional discipline will prevail. 
  [Question] How do you plan to establish relations with the 
kurultay faction following the well-known incident at the 
session? 
  [Tsekov] They will be built as they were built before: on 
the 
basis of mutual respect. [Word illegible] misunderstanding of my 
position as chairman. I would like the Crimean Tatar deputies to 
understand that I was in a very difficult situation as regards 
the candidates for chairman of the Commission for Nationality 
Policy and the Affairs of Deported Citizens. It was this that 
dictated the proposal that I made. And we made the right 
decision in postponing the elections until 20 May--I hope that 
the kurultay delegation will have returned from Kiev by that 
time. 
  [Question] What do you think, which group or faction of 
deputies has been the best prepared for work in parliament? 
  [Tsekov] As the experience of the three days of work has 
shown--the Russia faction. And, of course, the kurultay faction 
also is prepared for serious parliamentary work. 
  [Question] A record was set--one deputy went to the 
microphone 51 times. What do you intend doing to ensure that 
garrulous deputies not grab so much time for themselves? 
  [Tsekov] We are required to observe the standing orders, and 
if they permit a deputy to take the floor either 50 or 100 
times, this is a problem for the deputy, not the chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet and not the Supreme Soviet as a whole. It is 
possible that the Supreme Soviet will amend the standing orders 
accordingly. But the situation should not be dramatized. 
<H5>  Crimea and Ukraine </H5>
  [Question] What advantages would treaty relations with 
Ukraine convey, in what way would this be better than the Law on 
the Delineation of Powers? 
  [Tsekov] The economic situation in Crimea is wholly 
dependent 
on Ukraine because we are located in a single economic field. 
And mistakes that are made by the Ukrainian leadership are 
manifested most directly in Crimea, in a worse version even 
sometimes. Were a treaty to be signed, it would be easier for us 
to implement the right economic transformations. I could outline 
for you the first possibility of an improvement in the economic 
situation: the demilitarization of Crimea. In addition, we would 
remove the barriers between states, primarily with Russia.... 
  [Question] Your future steps for filling the state 
sovereignty of Crimea? 
  [Tsekov] These steps are clearly identified in the program 
of 
the Russia bloc: restoration of the constitution of 6 May 1992 
and the formation of a delegation to Kiev in order to persuade 
the leadership of Ukraine of the need to build relations with 
Crimea on a treaty basis. 
  [Question] What is the attitude of the Supreme Soviet of 
Crimea toward the impending elections of the president of 
Ukraine? Will Crimeans take part? 
  [Tsekov] I was unable in these three days to ascertain the 
Supreme Soviet's attitude toward this problem, it is not a 
question to be discussed there, although I do not rule out this 
possibility. The attitude of the majority of political parties, 
however, is unequivocal: Crimeans should not take part in the 
elections. 
  [Question] Do you consider it normal that the Supreme Soviet 
of Crimea is without the representation of Ukrainian 
organizations and Ukrainians in general? 
  [Tsekov] I cannot agree because the Russia bloc did not 
promote candidates on a national basis. And seven 
representatives of Ukrainian nationality were elected to the 
Crimean parliament. 
  [Question] Numerous demonstrations demanding the annulment 
of 
Crimean autonomy are taking place in Kiev. What if this were 
actually to happen--what might the steps of the Supreme Soviet 
of Crimea be? 
  [Tsekov] I cannot even imagine this, to be honest. This is 
practically impossible. Theoretically, yes, but we have in the 
past four years amassed sufficient experience, and among 
Ukrainian politicians there have come to be people who are 
perfectly sober-minded and who understand the Crimea 
situation--they understand what drastic action on the part of 
the Ukrainian leadership could signify: It would mean not only 
the complete detachment of Crimea from Ukraine but also the 
breakup of Ukraine itself. Our actions? We would not agree with 
such a decision, of course, and would take the appropriate 
steps, together with the president, naturally. 
  [Question] The Ukrainian and Russian press believe that the 
present composition of the Ukrainian parliament will adopt a 
tougher position in respect to Crimea. Do you share this 
viewpoint? How will you build your relations with the Ukrainian 
parliament? 
  [Tsekov] I believe that the attitude toward Crimea from the 
toughness viewpoint will change and that the situation will 
ease. I was a people's deputy of Ukraine for four years and I 
know how we were viewed by the national democrats initially: 
unequivocal rejection of the statehood of Crimea and all that 
was happening in Crimea. But two or three years have gone by, 
and many of them have already begun to say that there is a 
Crimea problem and that it needs to be resolved on the basis of 
political dialogue and that Crimea should be given as much 
authority as possible. The same will be the case with the 
present Supreme Council of Ukraine also. 
<H5>  Crimea-Russia-Ukraine </H5>
  [Question] Your vision of relations with Russia and Ukraine? 
  [Tsekov] These are big questions, and we have answered them 
repeatedly. Mutual relations should be built on a treaty 
basis--with both Russia and Ukraine. 
  [Question] How do you conceive of a treaty with 
Ukraine--what 
should it include? 
  [Tsekov] Any treaty may be of three types--economic, 
political, and military-political. I would want a treaty between 
Ukraine and Crimea to be a treaty of equals. I do not rule out a 
military- political treaty with Russia being concluded together 
with Ukraine and I hope that Ukraine will ultimately, after a 
certain length of time, arrive at an understanding of 
integration. 
<H5>  Sevastopol </H5>
  [Question] There is talk to the effect that the question of 
the transfer of the capital of Crimea to Sevastopol could be in 
the offing.... 
  [Tsekov] This is not our suggestion, it came, as far as I 
know, from the Crimea Economic Revival Party. The reasoning is 
that the question of Sevastopol's integration in Crimea could be 
solved quite gently in this case. A paradoxical situation has 
taken shape: Sevastopol is an inalienable part of Crimea, but 
the organs of state power are not formed according to 
legislation of Crimea, although, in accordance with all 
legislative instruments, of Ukraine included, the authority is 
ours. Were we to solve this question, there could, consequently, 
be no question of a transfer. If not, transfer of the capital 
could be assumed to be an option. 
  [Question] Do you consider the administrative association of 
Sevastopol and Crimea essential, and if this is realistic, in 
what kind of timeframe? 
  [Tsekov] Of course, Sevastopol is an inalienable part of 
Crimea, they must be together. The timeframe is a difficult 
matter. But work on this needs to be started at once. 
<H5>  Military Matters </H5>
  [Question] You are a supporter of a gradual demilitarization 
of Crimea. How will this process take place? What is the size of 
the forces? 
  [Tsekov] You know well enough the program of the Crimea 
Republican Party and the Russia bloc--it speaks of the need for 
military reform and says what is implied by this specifically: 
phased demilitarization of Crimea with the retention of a 
contingent of troops of reasonable sufficiency; territorial 
defense of Crimea within the framework of CIS collective 
security; the creation of a republican guard of Crimea for 
defense of the constitutional system of the Republic of Crimea 
and public safety. 
  Various figures for the size of the forces are 
cited--60,000, 
40,000, even 80,000--but I do not know the true size. 
  [Question] The Supreme Soviet has a Commission for Military 
Matters, Security, and Servicemen's Protection, and 
representatives of the Russia bloc constitute its majority. 
There are servicemen of both Russia and Ukraine in Crimea. Which 
servicemen's rights will this commission protect? 
  [Tsekov] I understand it to be a question of the rights of 
all servicemen stationed on the territory of Crimea. 
<H5>  Party and Speaker </H5>
  [Question] Do you intend combining the offices of chairman 
of 
the Supreme Soviet and party chairman? 
  [Tsekov] I do not at this moment consider that I have to 
quit 
the post of party chairman--as you know, the law permits this. 
If the congress considers otherwise, I am prepared to comply 
with this decision. But just as I was a member of the Crimea 
Republican Party, I would remain a Republican. 
  [Question] Who is today the ideologist of the Crimea 
Republican Party after the previous ideologist has declared his 
opposition? 
  [Tsekov] The Crimea Republican Party had several 
ideologists-- one was the president of Crimea, a second 
suspended his party membership, a third was to some extent 
myself, a fourth--V. 
Terekhov--is continuing his work. 
<H5>  The Supreme Soviet and the Executive </H5>
  [Question] Many edicts of the president of Crimea are not in 
effect today. What will the steps of the Supreme Soviet be? 
  [Tsekov] I am inclined to believe that we should confirm 
these edicts and thus help the president in their realization. 
  [Question] Will you be changing the structure of the 
government in accordance with the structure of the Supreme 
Soviet? 
  [Tsekov] Questions connected with the formation of the 
government are within the competence of the Supreme Soviet. I 
said at the session that it is necessary first and foremost to 
consider questions of Crimea's economic position and the 
structure and composition of the government. It is possible that 
the deputies will agree, and if there are objections, this will 
be ascertained at the session. The powers should, however, be 
equal and should balance one another. 
  [Question] Your personal opinion of the work of the 
government? How smooth will discussion of the composition of the 
government at the Supreme Soviet be? 
  [Tsekov] I do not have a full impression of its work, 
although it is positive, on the whole. And the discussion--have 
you noticed that discussion of the composition has not been 
smooth in a single CIS parliament? 
  [Question] How might you explain the president's aspiration 
to put together a Crimean Government of newcomers--what, is 
Crimea's intellectual potential exhausted? 
  [Tsekov] You had better ask Yu. Meshkov this. But I would 
not 
say that he is trying to form a government according to this 
principle. It will consist 90-95 percent of Crimeans. 
  As far as representatives of Russia in our government are 
concerned, this was necessary, and I fully approve and support 
this step of the president. What will happen in the future? 
Perhaps these people will become citizens of Crimea; it cannot 
be ruled out that their positions will be taken by Crimeans. But 
they have a sincere desire to help Crimea, I personally have no 
doubt about this. 
<H5>  S. Tsekov--Speaker </H5>
  [Question] How do you feel in the role of speaker? Are you 
coping with this role? 
  [Tsekov] I feel confident thus far. I do not know what the 
future will bring, but the first two days went better than I had 
expected. 
  [Question] How controllable is our parliament? Is it 
submitting to the will of the speaker? 
  [Tsekov] I have the impression that the deputies understand 
that it is necessary to hold plenary sittings efficiently and 
have learned rapidly how to avail themselves of the Council, and 
this was a problem--remember how they demanded that microphones 
be installed in the hall? We have left them, but it seems to me 
that they are availing themselves of them less and less often. 
  [Question] Have you met with N. Bagrov? 
  [Tsekov] I have spoken with Nikolay Vasilyevich by telephone 
and intend to meet with him in the very near future. The 
purpose? He is a chairman of the Supreme Soviet with great 
experience, and I would like to familiarize myself with this 
experience--but this does not mean that I will borrow it in full. 
  On the whole, I believe that we must switch to civilized 
forms of intercourse. I criticized the chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet before I was elected to this office, but I do not intend 
doing so after I myself have become chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Colonel General Petro Shulyak, </F>
commander of the Ciscarpathian Military District, PVO, by 
Lieutenant Colonel Vasyl Tarchynets, chief of the PVO press 
service; place and date not given: "Serving the Ukrainian 
People"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Tarchynets] Did it 
ever occur to you, when you were a platoon commander, that many 
years later you would be the commander of a district? What is 
your reaction to the presidential edict granting you command of 
the Ciscarpatian Military District? 
  [Shulyak] I did not even dream about such a post in my years 
as a lieutenant. However, frankly speaking, I have been pleased 
with all of my service advancements. I think it quite natural, 
because every soldier wants to make a career, to become a 
general. However, I have never attempted to get a promotion at 
any price; I have just worked honestly. Posts and ranks 
followed as recognition of my work. Therefore, I see my 
nomination for the commander of district troops as such a 
recognition as well. The president's edict in this regard is a 
legal document affirming my authority in the post of PVO 
commander. 
  [Tarchynets] How do you evaluate the current situation 
of the Ukrainian Army -- the combat training of its personnel, 
particularly, the preparedness of the conscripts, as well as 
technical supplies and morale among the ranks? 
  [Shulyak] I can say that the combat training of district 
units is at a level that guarantees the reliable protection of 
western state borders. This, by the way, was affirmed by the 
recent regiment exercises which were attended by Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk. However, the training and level of 
combat readiness are subject to change; they can be improved 
without limits. This refers also to the preparation of 
conscripts. Therefore, we, the servicemen, jointly with 
military registration and enlistment offices, the Association 
for Assisting the Defense of Ukraine, and other institutions, 
will take pains to get good specialists in our Army. There is 
every possibility to accomplish this. 
  Understandably, the quality of training of any army 
specialist also depends on the prevailing morale, in which he 
masters his combat craft. Unfortunately, it is too early to 
affirm that every problem has already been resolved here. Let 
us say quite openly: We have not yet eliminated violations of 
discipline, bullying of conscripts, or just bad manners in the 
Army. However, the morale in the Army is going to improve. 
  [Tarchynets] Why have PVO commanders been changed so 
frequently? 
  [Shulyak] It should be noted that personnel changes are 
being made not only in our district, but also in all the other 
structures of the Armed Forces. It is conditioned by the 
process of building our Army, by bringing its quality and size 
in line with Ukraine's military doctrine. There is reduction as 
well as creation of new structures in our troops. Personnel 
changes follow this process of building. I think that this is 
quite a natural phenomenon. 
  [Tarchynets] What is your opinion about Kostyantyn 
Morozov's retirement from the post of defense minister? What do 
you think about his book "Flight Under President's Wing"? Was 
General Morozov the right man for the post of defense 
minister? 
  [Shulyak] I will begin with the last question. Yes, Colonel 
General Kostyantyn Morozov undoubtedly was the right man for his 
post at the stage of the creation of Ukraine's Armed Forces. He 
did a lot to provide our state with its own Army. With regard 
to subsequent activities of the former defense minister and his 
book "Flight Under President's Wing," I think that this can be 
evaluated only by those who worked with General Morozov and 
possess appropriate information. 
  [Tarchynets] What is General Stepanov's -- the former 
PVO commander's -- lot? What is he doing? 
  [Shulyak] Lieutenant General Stepanov has been appointed 
deputy commander of the Odessa Military District for issues of 
reform. He still occupies this post. 
  [Tarchynets] Are you satisfied with your subordinates? 
Do you intend to make personnel changes in the district staff, 
combined units, formations, and units? 
  [Shulyak] There are experienced and competent officers and 
generals in the district staff; therefore I think that any 
urgent personnel changes are inexpedient. The same refers to 
the commands of combined units, formations, and units. However, 
as is known, the district command recently underwent some 
changes. There were new deputy commanders and chiefs of certain 
departments and services nominated, while their predecessors 
were promoted to higher posts. For instance, Major Generals Oleh 
Shustenko and Ivan Kolesnikov became deputy commanders of the 
PVO troops, Major General Volodymyr Chernykh headed the PVO rear 
units, and Colonel Leonid Polishchuk became chief of the PVO 
personnel department. Colonel Vasyl Kazmirchuk was nominated 
chief of the troops of radioactive, chemical, and biological 
protection. 
  Following the creation of a new Armed Forces unit -- the 
Land 
Forces -- which are headed by Colonel General Vasyl Sobkov, 
deputy defense minister, a group of PVO officers and generals 
will be transferred to work in the Staff of the Land Forces. 
Thus, there are more personnel changes to come. [passage

Meshkov: `I Am Walking Alone. Only a Stony Road Glimmers in 
the Haze....'"] 
  [Text] For Yuriy Meshkov, this date was probably a holiday. 
He laughed and joked a lot. Answering a question as to what he 
will do if official Kiev adopts a decision to introduce 
Ukrainian presidential rule in the Crimea, Meshkov said: "A 
wise man acts only one way. A stupid person can make a choice." 
Meshkov held out hopes -- referring to a recent visit to the 
Crimea by acting Prime Minister Zvyahilskyy -- that Ukraine has 
many sane people and it is up to them to define 
Crimean-Ukrainian relations. 
  As to the recent and unexpected statement by Leonid 
Kravchuk, 
who stated his personal opinion that the Crimean Tatars, like 
other peoples, have the right to self-determination and the 
establishment of their own state, Meshkov said that his position 
on this issue is different: "Of course, the full volume of 
human rights should be observed. The other issue is that of 
"satisfying one's ambitions." 
  With regard to the issue of Crimean Tatars (and the 50th 
anniversary of their deportation from the Crimea, the date being 
marked these days), Meshkov took into consideration the presence 
of foreign journalists and delivered an eloquent speech devoted 
to the tragedy of the deported peoples and the fault of all 
those (he mentioned the Crimea, Ukraine, Russia, and 
Uzbekistan), who did not take the pain of these peoples for 
their own tragedy. Later, Meshkov recalled the phrase: "The 
bell tolls for you." The president said that not all debts had 
been paid and he focused on the issue of the quota of Crimean 
Tatars among the Crimean Supreme Soviet deputies: "I am still 
of the opinion that political rights are not connected with 
national traits." 
  The president also spoke about his constant desire to keep 
his promise and crush the Mafia. However, he made allusions to 
something that no one could understand. To avoid any 
unnecessary reproaches for imprecision, I am going to cite 
Meshkov: "As to the defeat of the Mafia, it was supposed that 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs, along with the internal 
affairs minister, fully meet the existing demands on them. 
However, this is not true. You were present when the BBC 
queried the internal affairs minister on 5 September. In his 
interview, he declassified the operation which could cost the 
lives of his colleagues, my life, and the lives of the members 
of my family. The internal affairs minister declassified this 
operation. Later, he declared that he will not perform his 
duties because he has a president with such and such decrees. 
Therefore, we did not do much, however, we planned more. 
However, this subject is still pressing and the interested 
circles know that this issue will be radically resolved." 
  This speech resulted in more questions than proposals. What 
did former minister A. Plyuta declassify? What has Meshkov's 
life -- who marked his first 100 days in office -- to do with 
the 5 September interview? Does Meshkov mean his order 
regarding the arrest of 100-150 men who were allegedly Mafia 
members? However, the evidence of their conniving with the 
Mafia had to be searched for during the court proceedings which 
were supported by a storm of applause. What hampers the new 
internal minister in his fight against criminal groups which are 
operating quite openly? Finally, does Meshkov know who is among 
his entourage? If he does, with what Mafia is he going to 
combat? At the end of his crime-oriented monologue, we 
understood: It is not, while it is [as published]. 
  What Meshkov did not mention was even more interesting. 
There were plans for a trade agreement with Russia to become 
the triumph of Meshkov's first 100 days because we see no other 
results at all. However, he kept silent on this subject. 
Probably, the reason was that S. Shakhray, Russia's 
representative, who, along with Crimean Deputy Prime Minister 
Saburov signed this agreement, resigned from his post the same 
day (he did not know that Yeltsin had already dismissed him) and 
held a news conference. 
  Meshkov also declared, in fact, avoiding straightforward 
statements, that the Crimea had to conduct a step-by-step 
demilitarization; that the National Guard of the Republic of 
Crimea -- which a new legislature plans to organize -- would 
not be a military unit but a department for maintaining public 
order; that an extravagant idea of moving the Crimean capital 
from Simferopol to Sevastopol was caused by circumstances; that 
the deputies' impatience to show the government what is what 
will not result in a confrontation between the president and the 
legislature; and that Kiev's plausible attempts to repeal the 
autonomy cannot be conducted "immediately." 
  The day when a representative of the Ukrainian president was 
nominated to the Crimea, was, in Meshkov's words, the most 
depressing day in his 100 day presidential career. He made 
assurances that the happiest day is still awaiting him. In 
compliance with a request to cite some poetry to demonstrate his 
current emotional state, he cited Lermontov's poetry: "Only a 
stony road glimmers in the haze...." Then he thought for a 
while and added: "And I am walking alone." This, in my mind, 
corresponds to the truth.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 20, BNS -- Cabinet members from the 
Estonian Rural Centrist Party [ERCP], Reform Minister Liia Hanni 
and Agriculture Minister Jaan Leetsar, announced today after a 
party council meeting that they will not quit. 
  Ministers from the National Independence Party and the 
Social 
Democratic Party announced their decision to continue in the 
government earlier. 
  The ERCP council didn't regard the situation in the Cabinet 
as a government crisis, but blamed it on personality clashes not 
rooted in differences over policy. 
  "The survival of the coalition in the parliament confirms 
that this isn't a government crisis," the party council 
maintained. 
  "Regarding Laar as the reason behind the disagreements, 
several younger ministers want to solve the conflict through 
replacing the prime minister. We think it's politically 
shortsighted to use the premier's guarantee to the Lekto 
company's loan as a pretext to replace the head of the 
government," the ERCP council statement reads. 
  The party council holds the opinion that, in the interests 
of 
democratic development, the Pro Patria congress must be given an 
opportunity to discuss and resolve the differences of opinion 
between its ministers. 
  Justice Minister Kaido Kama, who resigned on Thursday [19 
May], claimed in an interview to BNS that several other Cabinet 
members from the National Independence Party and the Rural 
Centrist Party were considering stepping down. 
  Hanni said at a news conference today that she continuously 
discussed the situation with the ERCP council, but that she 
never considered leaving the government. 
  "We mustn't attach overmuch importance to what happened, but 
seek solutions and spend more thought on the future. Pro Patria 
must itself solve its differences, since a quick stabilization 
of the situation is necessary with a view to the upcoming 
elections," Hanni told BNS.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 23, BNS -- Members of the Estonian 
Liberal Democratic Party [ELDP], Culture and Education Minister 
Paul-Eerik Rummo and Finance Minister Heiki Kranich will for the 
time being continue as Cabinet members. 
  Rummo and Kranich were authorized by the ELDP council and 
the 
Liberals faction in parliament to continue in the present 
government pending the outcome of the Pro Patria congress 
scheduled mid-June in Tallinn. 
  The decision was made already Thursday [19 May] but the 
party 
council and the Liberals faction agreed to make it public only 
after the coalition council session early this morning. 
  The ELDP proposes that Pro Patria's coalition partners -- 
the 
Estonian Rural Centrist Party [ERCP], the Estonian National 
Independence Party [ENIP], the Estonian Social Democratic Party 
[ESDP] and the ELDP -- should get together and work out their 
stand on the nomination of a new prime minister as well as other 
possible Cabinet reshuffles. 
  The ELDP says its proposal stems from its "concern that the 
government should remain operational and the coalition survive." 
  The other coalition partners, ERCP, ENIP and ESDP, announced 
at the end of last week they don't plan to recall their 
ministers from the government. Pro Patria member, Foreign 
Minister Juri Luik told reporters today he has no intention of 
leaving the Cabinet before the Pro Patria congress.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 23, BNS -- The Russian Representative 
Assembly finds that Estonia should grant permanent residence 
permits to all the non-citizens who since July 1990 have been 
permanently living in Estonia, says a declaration the 
organization adopted at its annual conference May 21. 
  The assembly proposes to simplify the complicated procedure 
of issuing residence permits by reregistering all resident list 
entries made before July 1990. 
  The statement suggests that persons living in Estonia since 
July 1990 should be given legal guarantees as to receiving 
residence permits. 
  "A short, simple and universally understandable procedure 
needs to be worked out that wouldn't depend on politics and the 
arbitrariness of officials," the statement reads. The assembly 
holds the position that the promises and decrees of the 
government are insufficient as guarantee. 
  The Estonian Cabinet ruled at the end of last month to 
extend 
the residence permit application deadline and grant the rights 
of a permanent resident to those holders of temporary residence 
permits who were entered in permanent resident lists before July 
1990. The government decree stemmed from the wave of protests 
of Russian organizations against the current procedure for 
registering permit applications and issuing permits. 
  The Russian Representative Assembly also urges that the 
issue 
of granting residence and work permits to Russian retired 
officers be solved in a "humane manner." 
  "This issue of principle will probably have to be solved at 
interstate (Estonian-Russian) negotiations," the statement 
reads. The assembly suggests that, pending solution, all 
military retirees be issued temporary residence permits and 
granted all rights of a permanent resident.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 23, BNS -- World Bank officials at the 
recent seminar in Paris on Baltic states' economics advised 
Estonia to step up state investments to promote economic growth, 
the Finance Ministry press service told BNS. 
  The meeting in Paris noted that in the process of economic 
stabilization state investments have substantially decreased. 
  A three-year, 4.8-billion-kroon investment program suggested 
by the World Bank would keep Estonia's foreign debt at a 
moderate, manageable level, taking into account the credits 
already extended to the country. The program proposes that 2.1 
billion kroons should come from the state budget. 
  The World Bank conference on the Baltic states' economies 
devoted one day, May 20, to Estonia. Representatives of the 
Estonian delegation, the World Bank, the International Monetary 
Fund and the European Union evaluated the development of the 
country's economy to date and its investment plans, and meetings 
of working groups in the spheres of energy, transportation and 
environment took place. Donor states and organizations reported 
on their aid programs. The day before, on May 19, the Estonian 
delegation held negotiations with German, Japanese and Swiss 
delegations. 
  The conference passed in a businesslike, friendly 
atmosphere. 
Estonian economic reforms were repeatedly praised. The goal of 
the meeting was neither discussion and approval of concrete 
projects nor extraction of promises from donors but, rather, the 
fashioning of general attitudes. It is clear that planning of 
centrally coordinated investments ensures the best possible 
representation of all interests in terms of both economic 
efficiency and social justice, the Finance Ministry press 
service informs.

  [Text] Riga, May 21, BNS -- Latvian Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs met with North Atlantic Assembly (NAA) President Loic 
Bouvard and Secretary General Peter Corterier and discussed 
Latvian security policy and mutual cooperation, the Government 
Information Agency reported. 
  During the meeting, Birkavs acquainted the NAA delegation 
with the signed Latvian-Russian agreements on troop withdrawal 
and the beginning of their implementation. 
  Birkavs thanked NAA for support to the Russian troop 
withdrawal from Latvia and urged NATO countries to monitor the 
implementing of the signed agreements, especially what regards 
the continued operation of the Skrunda radar facility. 
  Birkavs reiterated that Latvia's security policy was 
unambiguously oriented toward joining the North Atlantic 
alliance. Latvia views any form of military cooperation with 
Russia as unacceptable, Birkavs added. 
  The officials also touched on NAA assistance in the 
formation 
of the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion. 
  Corterier and Bouvard also met Friday [20 May] with Latvian 
Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis, parliament Chairman 
Anatolijs Gorbunovs and government officials. 
  NAA is an interparliamentary organization that acts as a 
legislative forum of the North Atlantic Assembly member states. 
It aims at promoting mutual understanding and information 
exchange. 
  The three Baltic states and nine other former Communist bloc 
countries are NAA associate members. It means they may 
participate in the assembly work and debate but may not vote.

  [Text] The commission set up by the government to control 
the implementation of the package of the Latvian-Russian 
agreements signed in Moscow at the end of April on the army 
withdrawal convened for its first session at the Latvian Cabinet 
of Ministers today. At the session, the Latvian Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Regional Development was instructed 
to submit to the government session on Tuesday a package of 
documents that are necessary to begin the work of the fund for 
Skrunda environmental rehabilitation and the repatriation of the 
military. 
  The Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
and the Home Guard, for their part, must submit proposals to the 
government as early as possible on the organization for guarding 
the new building of the Skrunda radar station that will be taken 
over. 
  According to the package of agreements, the Russian Army is 
still guarding Skrunda radar facilities and the territory taken 
over from Russia. The issue of organizing the guarding of these 
facilities will be considered at Tuesday's session of the 
Cabinet of Ministers. 
  After the session today, Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, head 
of the commission, visited the Russian Air Force airfield at 
Lielvarde. According to the army withdrawal schedule submitted 
by Russia, the Russian Army must leave the Lielvarde airfield by 
31 July 1994. There are approximately 300 Russian military 
stationed at the facility at the moment. 
  Birkavs is planning to visit the Zvaigznite space 
reconnaissance station in Ventspils district next week. This is 
one of the three facilities that, together with Liepaja port and 
the Skrunda radar station, have been called strategically 
important by Russia at the interstate talks.

  [Text] The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry has spoken out for 
preserving Ukraine's territorial integrity. In its Monday 
statement the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry says that Lithuania 
recognized the Ukrainian territorial integrity in February 1994 
in accordance with the major international principles. The 
statement comes on the heel of a decision by the Crimean 
parliament on 20th May to conduct its foreign policy 
independently from the Ukraine and to have its own armed forces. 
The law on the revival of the Crimean constitution was 
denounced as unlawful by Ukraine. The Crimean authorities in 
their turn responded by suspending the decision [as heard] of 
the Ukrainian parliament on the peninsula. The Lithuanian 
Foreign Office called upon the parties to solve all 
disagreements by applying sensible and commonly acceptable 
measures. 
  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas has also urged all 
political forces and officials involved in the Crimea dispute to 
approach the issue with responsibility and moderacy [as heard]. 
In his Monday statement the president said that international 
organizations should concentrate on producing a quick and 
peaceful solution to the Crimean issue, preventing the peninsula 
from turning into a source of instability that could threaten 
security in the region and on the continent.

  [Text] France understands ever better Lithuania's economic 
and political aims and is determined to support them by every 
means. This was said by Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius after 
his visit to France. 
  According to him, his meetings with the French president, 
the 
head of the government, some members of the Cabinet of 
Ministers, and representatives of influential financial and 
trading companies, demonstrated there was a great interest in 
Lithuania and in the possibilities of political and economic 
cooperation. This cooperation, claims Adolfas Slezevicius, 
should become concrete now. 
  As is known, the Lithuanian delegation led by Adolfas 
Slezevicius paid a working visit to Paris on 17-21 May. 
  The Lithuanian prime minister mentioned the European 
stability pact as one of the most important facts of political 
support. Adolfas Slezevicius has an especially favorable opinion 
about the initiative by the French prime minister to hold 
regional round tables where it will be possible to discuss at 
the level of European state leaders and experts, for example, 
relations between the Baltic states and Russia. This will 
divert our dialogue with Russia in a completely different 
direction, claims Adolfas Slezevicius. 
  It is especially important to Lithuania in the sense of 
economic cooperation to attract as much French capital as 
possible to Lithuania. Some conditions are essential for this 
purpose, for instance, the protection of and guarantees to 
investments, insurance, the abolition of double taxation, etc. 
  According to Adolfas Slezevicius, expert missions from 
French 
insurance companies, the Central Bank, the Finance Ministry, and 
the electronic industry, will soon be coming to Lithuania. 
Concrete projects in which French companies could take part 
will be discussed. Technical assistance is possible in the 
administration of taxes and in financial payments.

  [Text] Baghdad, 19 May (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH has 
said that renewing and perpetuating the unfair embargo on Iraq 
will continue to be a U.S.-Zionist wager blessed by the 
humiliated henchmen in the region in order to peddle evil and 
suspicious U.S.-Zionist schemes. 
  In an article today, the paper, the mouthpiece of the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party, says: Regardless of this renewal and 
continuation of the embargo, Washington knows well that Iraq is 
not an easy prey and that Iraq will continue to be a thorn that 
bleeds the enemies' soft spot, deprives them of sleep, and 
obstructs their plans. 
  The paper says that despite all the conspiracies concocted 
against its principles, Iraq will continue to adhere to its 
leadership and to care for its unity. Iraq is capable of 
foiling all the evil greed by further patience, steadiness, and 
perseverance. 
  AL-THAWRAH continues: We do not pin much hope on lifting the 
unfair embargo through a Security Council resolution. Instead, 
we wager on Iraq's continued patience and perseverance in order 
to fragment and terminate the embargo. The paper stresses that 
all signs confirm that [word indistinct] is with us and that 
what appears on the surface in terms of conspiracies and renewed 
embargo are only futile attempts.

  [Text] Baghdad, May 20, INA--Baghdad Mayorality has called 
upon international and humanitarian organisations the world over 
to take a swift action to save Iraq's environment and treat 
environmental pollution that poses major threats to the lives of 
Iraqi people. 
  In a press conference held recently, Baghdad Mayor Tahir 
Muhammad Hassun shed light on the environmental hazards that 
ensured from the direct and indirect effects of the U.S.-led 
aggression against Iraq. In an urgent call to international and 
humanitarian organisations all over the world, Mr. Hassun urged 
for an immediate action to save the Iraqi environment. 
  The "Baghdad Call" aims at attracting the world's attention 
to the great damage inflicted by the U.S.-allied war and the 
continuation of the economic sanctions, the mayor said. He 
added that Iraq's environment has been greatly affected by the 
barbaric bombing by allied forces during the U.S.-led military 
aggression, indicating that the destruction of electric power 
faculties and water and waste water treatment plants has led to 
a cycle of contamination. 
  The mayor added that Baghdad is calling for help because the 
embargo has greatly affected the level of municipal services, 
noting that Baghdad is some 900 square kilometres in area and 
has a 4.5 million population. He said Baghdad city is divided 
into some 1.3 [figure as received] municipal units has some 467 
residential quarters. The mayor added that due to the 
continuation of the embargo the average water delivery has 
decreased from 45 liters per capita per day (L/C/D) before the 
war to reach some 18 liters per capita per day after the war. 
  The mayor elaborated that severe damage has been inflicted 
upon water and waste water treatment plants. Moreover, fresh 
sewage is either overflowing in the streets or being discharged 
into the Tigris and the Euphrates without any treatment. 
Furthermore, allied bombing of roads and lack of spare parts 
needed to carry out maintenance because of the sanctions had 
caused cracks in sewer lines which in consequence caused ground 
water contamination. Many of these systems are either out of 
operation or operated at a reduced capacity because of pump 
breakdown, said the mayor. 
  The ultimate threat is posed by the large quantities of 
sewage which flow untreated into the country's two major rivers 
and run downstream. These rivers, the Euphrates and Tigris, 
constitute the main water sources of the country, said the 
mayor, adding that some 50 per cent, that is some five cubic 
metres per second sewage water is being pumped directly into 
rivers. 
  He added that Baghdad outskirts are still suffering from 
lack 
of potable water, noting that about one-third of Baghdad city 
lacks waste-water treatment system due to the stoppage of work 
on sewage and waste-water treatment projects due to lack of 
spare parts and materials due to the sanctions. 
  Moreover, the work of waste collecting vehicles is hampered 
by lack of maintenance and spare parts causing in consequence 
heaps of garbage in residential quarters of Baghdad, noting that 
the number of workers has also decreased from 6332 to some 2500 
ones. 
  Solid waste disposal has been disrupted, consequently 
causing 
air pollution because people often tend to incinerate rubbish, 
said the mayor. 
  Mr. Hassun added that the sanctions have also brought work 
on 
renovation project of Baghdad city of a standstill, noting that 
work on the said project has started in 1980s. He added that 
the project aims at renovating and refurbishing ancient and 
historical sites and holy shrines and historical mosques and 
churches. 
  Mr. Hassun warned of the spread of epidemics saying that 
people of Baghdad city suffer from the wide spread of epidemics 
resulting from environmental pollution, the accumulation of 
garbage and lack of municipal services, noting that Baghdad 
hospitals hae reported a noticeable increase in communicable 
diseases. 
  The mayor urged health organisations the world over to act 
swiftly for lifting the 45-month-old economic sanction imposed 
on Iraq.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi: "The </F>
Blockade Wall Will Collapse Whether They Like It or Not"] 
  [Text] Those who follow international affairs know that few 
states have carried out UN Security Council resolutions. 
Because, very often big power interests influence the issuance 
and implementation of these resolutions. 
  Perhaps, Iraq is foremost among world states that have 
responded positively by fulfilling its obligations under UN 
Security Council Resolution 687, as admitted by UN Special 
Commission Chairman Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, who acknowledged 
Iraq's full cooperation with the council. 
  The question now is: Since the United States pressured the 
council to pass that resolution in order to impose an unfair 
blockade on the Iraqi people, and it has kept demanding for 
several years that Iraq must first implement that resolution, 
which links the lifting of the blockade to Iraqi fulfillment of 
its obligations under the resolution, and since the United 
States has spoken clearly in those terms, why is it now raising 
political issues and aims that have nothing to do with 
Resolution 687, whose Paragraph (22) permits Iraq to export oil 
once it has fulfilled its obligations? 
  This clearly shows that Washington is pursuing a double 
standard policy and that it will not hesitate to commit the most 
hideous crimes, such as the unfair blockade it has imposed on 
the Iraqi people, in order to achieve its aggressive designs 
against peoples that struggle for their freedom and dignity. 
  It is now clear to the whole world that two standards are 
being followed with regard to UN resolutions: First, an 
objective standard that calls for strict implementation of a 
clear resolution, and this is the standard upheld by the 
majority of world nations and most UN Security Council member 
states. Second, a standard based on a hostile and biased 
attitude toward Resolution 687 in order to harm the Iraqi 
people, and this is the dirty standard followed by the United 
States, the Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers, and other pro-U.S. regimes. 
  These vile people do not care about anything in the world 
other than devising the most hideous ways in order to harm the 
Iraqi people and to commit crimes against them. 
  Resolution 687 is clear and frank. It places certain 
obligations on Iraq as well as on the Security Council. Now 
that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations, justice, fairness, and 
international legitimacy and legality, which Washington often 
brags about, oblige the Security Council to honor its 
obligations toward Iraq by lifting the unfair blockade, which is 
no longer justifiable following the removal of all the causes 
which are supposed to have led to the passing of Resolution 687. 
  Washington's procrastination and attempts to circumvent the 
resolution in order to bar the council from honoring its 
obligations toward Iraq by lifting the unfair blockade, and its 
claim about "a constant Iraqi threat" in order to blackmail 
Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers and to plunder the wealth of the Arab 
people, who have been afflicted by those traitorous rulers, are 
poor and ridiculous excuses which cannot maintain any form of 
stability and security in the region, and they will certainly 
not guarantee the legitimate interests of Washington and other 
powers in the region. 
  The wall of the blockade will certainly collapse through the 
solid will of the Iraqis and their great leader Saddam Husayn. 
The unfair ones will only reap failure and disappointment.

  [Text] Baghdad, 24 May (INA) -- BABIL has asserted that the 
only way for America and its allied reactionary forces to 
promote regionalism is by crushing the innocent masses through 
destructive crises, such as civil wars, armed rebellions, 
starvation, disruption of security, and lack of justice. 
  In an article today, the paper wonders: Why do the United 
States, Saudi Arabia, and the Egyptian regime want a cease-fire 
in Yemen, although they are fanning the flames of crises, wars, 
and divisions and are trying to partition Sudan and Iraq? Why 
did they sow the seeds of rebellion and nurture them until they 
grew in certain quarters in southern Yemen and are now trying to 
stop the fighting? 
  The paper asserts that anyone who thinks that America and 
its 
agents in Riyadh and Cairo think about preventing Arab bloodshed 
is deluded and influenced by the hostile, misleading media. It 
is enough to see how the United States provides weapons to, and 
protects the separatists in southern Sudan, northern Iraq, and 
southern Yemen, to ascertain that the United States has 
sanctioned the spilling of Arab blood and made it cheaper than 
water and oil. 
  The paper adds that America's major interest lies in 
perpetuating the Yemeni crisis in the form of various continuing 
bloody conflicts that extend over a long period of time so as to 
destroy the basic ideals in the citizens' minds and make them 
harbor personal grudges against each other. 
  The paper notes that the Yemeni unionist forces' adoption of 
military action to decide the situation and their rejection of 
any settlement is a direct blow to the U.S. scheme because this 
checks the other steps aimed at pushing the masses toward an 
inferno of regional grudges and revenge. Thus, regionalism will 
be limited to the separatist faction in Aden. 
  The paper adds that Yemen's step is in the right direction 
and complements the Mother of Battles when the Iraq of Saddam 
Husayn denied America and the Zionists the chance to partition 
Iraq. 
  BABIL concludes that the appeal for a cease-fire in Yemen is 
merely a U.S.-Zionist-reactionary attempt to save the forces of 
apostasy and prolong the suffering in order to remold the 
psychology of the masses to accept the reality of secession as 
the best of all the bad choices.

  [Text] Two British firms have declined to export drugs for 
heart diseases to Iraq on the pretext that these drugs could be 
used in the arms industry! 
  In a research she presented at a seminar on the Arab family, 
which was held recently by the Arab Women Federation, Dr. 
Ittihad Salih Mahdi 'Ammash said that several British and U.S. 
firms have declined to export drugs considered essential for 
saving patients' lives, especially drugs for heart diseases, 
diabetes, and cancer, in addition to other medical requirements, 
due to pressure from their governments on the pretext that some 
of these drugs enter into the arms industry. 
  Dr. 'Ammash said: A roomful of heart disease pills would not 
be sufficient to produce a single hand grenade. So, you can 
imagine the fallacies of those states and their false claims 
about human rights. 
  Dr. 'Ammash affirmed that the Health Ministry has signed 
contracts and paid money in hard currencies for the purchase of 
those drugs from private sector firms in order to save patients' 
lives, but those states have declined to export them. This has 
led to the death of thousands of patients with those diseases, 
she added. 
  According to the research, Iraq used to import $500 million 
worth of drugs annually. Now, however, and especially in the 
next three years, Iraq will only be able to obtain $100 million 
worth of drugs, including those which are received as aid. So, 
one can imagine the suffering of Iraqi patients.

<F P=106> ["Windows" column by Diya' Hasan: "The Nation is Strong With </F>
Iraq, Not Without It"] 
  [Text] Hafiz al-Asad's foreign minister Faruq al-Shar' has 
discovered at last that Arab suffering is due to the 
deterioration of Arab solidarity. He cited as examples the 
situation in Somalia, the blockade on Libya, and the conditions 
of the Palestinians under occupation. However, he completely 
ignored the suffering of the Iraqi people, as if he has not 
heard of the criminal blockade on Iraq due to that 
deterioration, for which his regime is largely responsible. 
  The Syrian minister knows very well that his regime has 
never 
stood for the unification of ranks and the building of a base 
for solidarity. On the contrary, his regime has stood against 
everything that is pan-Arab, and its leaders have sided with 
those who covet the nation and their actions have centered on 
foiling all efforts toward Arab solidarity. They imposed a 
blockade on Iraq and its people long before the foreigners did. 
Their ban on the flow of Iraqi oil through Syrian and Lebanese 
territories and ports preceded Washington's blockade of Iraq by 
10 years. Hafiz al-Asad's cooperation with Bush and his 
participation in the 30-state aggression against our people 
explains the nature of his regime, which is against everything 
that is Arab and is hostile to Arab national awakening. 
  What twisted logic is Hafiz al-Asad's minister trying to 
propagate when he insists on ignoring the suffering of the 
Iraqis? What kind of Arab solidarity can he propound in the 
absence of Iraq and amid the involvement of his regime and 
others in the continuation of the blockade on our people? He 
thinks that people are so stupid that they have not realized 
until now that the Syrian regime is playing its role exactly as 
planned, and that a settlement, as desired by Washington and 
with the participation of the Syrian regime of course, can only 
take place in the absence of Arab solidarity and Iraq. But for 
how long will that continue? This is the important question. 
Since the failure of the aggression, events have confirmed 
that no one can overlook lraq's power and ability. It is an 
asset to the nation's continued existence and awakening. Iraq 
is here to stay, O minister of Hafiz!

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Armed Clashes Renewed Between </F>
Kurdish Parties in Northern Iraq"] 
  [Text] London -- Two years after the first general free 
multiparty elections in Iraqi Kurdistan (yesterday was the 
anniversary), an increasing number of Iraqi Kurds feel 
frustrated and disappointed as armed clashes between Kurdish 
parties continue for the third consecutive week resulting in 
major human and material losses as well as disruption of normal 
life and appearance of signs of foreign intervention in Kurdish 
affairs. Independent Kurdish sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
yesterday that the fighting which began at the beginning of this 
month between the militias of the Kurdistan Democratic Party led 
by Mas'ud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] led 
by Jalal Talabani has resulted in hundreds of military and 
civilian casualties, both dead and wounded, and similar numbers 
taken prisoner, in addition to serious material losses. The 
sources said that tension returned in the past few days after 
last week's guarded calm during which the leaders of the parties 
of Barzani and Talabani tried in vain to implement agreements 
they had reached for stopping the fighting and normalizing the 
situation. 
  Sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that fierce fighting 
broke out yesterday between the two parties in the strategic 
city of Shaqlawah near Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish region, 
and, according to some other sources, widespread clashes have 
been going on for days in the eastern areas near the border with 
Iran between PUK forces and forces of the Islamic Movement of 
Iraqi Kurdistan [IMIK] and Hizballah, the two Islamic 
organizations suspected of receiving financial and military aid 
from Iran. 
  The sources also said that a prominent member of Talabani's 
party was killed last Tuesday in an ambush laid by the 
Islamists. They said that Hasan Kawistani, member of the PUK 
leadership, and 16 of his companions were killed in the Hajj 
'Umran area northeast of Irbil near the border with Iran when 
they were on their way to a meeting with local officials of 
Barzani's party. 
  The same sources said that the population in Irbil, 
al-Sulaymaniyah, and other Kurdish cities are facing increasing 
shortages of food, medicine, and basic services because of the 
suspension of transport movement on the road linking the two 
biggest Kurdish cities with Zakhu near the Turkish border, 
through which the Kurds received most of their food and medical 
needs.

  [Text] Irbil, 21 May (INA)--Reports from Irbil have said 
that clashes between the cliques of Talabani and Barzani resumed 
today in the district of Shaqlawah, the summer resort of Salah 
al-Din, and some neighborhoods in the city of Irbil. These 
clashes claimed the lives of dozens of innocent citizens. Many 
people from both sides were also killed or wounded. 
  In the past two days, the Talabani group attempted to attack 
the elements and centers of the clique of the so-called Islamic 
Movement in Halabjah and nearby areas. The group, however, 
achieved nothing. It recently cut the power supply of this area, 
which is fed by power generators from the city of 
al-Sulaymaniyah. 
  The Talabani group said that Hasan Kuwistani [name as 
received], Political Bureau member of Talabani's party, and 
seven other party members were killed in the Hajj 'Umran sector, 
and that the killers mutilated his body and used a car to pull 
it before people in Hajj 'Umran.

  [Text] Ankara, May 20 (AFP)--Mas'ud Barzani, head of the 
Kurdistan Democratic Party, Friday appealed for a ceasefire 
between his forces and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in 
Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. 
  "I appeal to all the parties to stop the war and end the 
Kurdish bloodshed," Barzani said in a statement received by AFP 
in Ankara Friday. 
  The Patriotic Union, led by Jalal Talabani, and the 
Democratic Party have both rejected responsibility for the 
outbreak of fighting Wednesday and Thursday which broke a 
ceasefire agreement signed May 8. 
  Northern Iraq has been under the control of the two 
movements 
since an uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's army 
at the end of the Gulf War in February 1991. 
  Officials from the Iraqi National Congress, a coalition said 
to represent all Kurdish and Arab groups opposed to the Iraqi 
leader, Thursday accused the Patriotic Union of breaching the 
previous ceasefire agreement. 
  Barzani called for joint efforts with the Iraqi National 
Congress to normalise the relationship. 
  The May 8 agreement, brokered by the Iraqi National 
Congress, 
came after two weeks of fighting in which at least 100 people 
were killed.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "Freedom for Parliament in Irbil"] </F>
  [Text] Dear listener: You must be surprised at the 
headline because it calls for freedom for the parliament that is 
supposed to be the guarantor of freedom. This appeal has been 
prompted by the fact that international parliamentary figures 
and blocs from various European and other countries have 
recently sent letters to the speaker of the Kurdistan National 
Council, the Kurdistan parliament, in Irbil. The letters call 
on him to hold a parliament meeting to discuss problems 
resulting from the current crisis and the regrettable clashes in 
Iraqi Kurdistan and provide solutions for them. 
  The speaker of parliament responded to these letters, 
explaining the situation as it really is. 
  Respected listeners; Our people's friends from the members 
of world parliaments are, of course, right. What they demand 
should be achieved because logically it is the best way out of 
the crisis if there are attentive people with sound eyes and 
ears. However, the facts on the ground are both comic and 
tragic. The Kurdistan parliament is besieged by war. To make 
what we say more explicit, we say: 
  1. On a momentous hour the night of 3-4 May 1994, the 
fighters of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] headed for 
the parliament building in Irbil. After disarming and beating 
the parliament's guards, they occupied the building and 
plundered some of the furniture. Then they went to the roof of 
the building and transformed it into a trench for confrontation 
and battles. 
  2. Despite bilateral [as heard] attempts and other attempts 
within the framework of the Kurdistan Front, the PUK fighters 
continued to occupy the building. 
  3. In a report disseminated worldwide on 20 May 1994, REUTER 
correspondent, Mr. (Alistair Belloc), said that the PUK fighters 
are occupying the parliament and other government buildings in 
Irbil. 
  4. The PUK fighters attacked a number of ministries and 
government departments, especially the finance and education 
ministries. They broke doors and looted some furniture. They 
placed barricade over the roofs of these buildings. 
  5. Fighters of the PUK are establishing barricades and 
checkpoints on streets leading to the parliament and Council of 
Ministers buildings, as well as the education, finance, culture, 
and other ministries which are adjacent to each other and very 
close to the parliament building. 
  Thus, it is very difficult to hold a parliament meeting in 
this tense atmosphere and amid these military measures. 
Naturally, we warmly welcome initiatives and appeals by our 
friends from world parliaments and parliamentary blocs in 
various countries. We support presenting problems and tackling 
them in parliament because this is the natural solution of the 
problem. But how can a meeting be convened under the shadow of 
arms and in a tense atmosphere? 
  Therefore, we propose that all fighters should withdraw as 
soon as possible from the roof and from inside the parliament 
building, that the protection of the building should be restored 
to the original guards entrusted with protecting parliament, 
that the stolen furniture be restored to the building, that the 
fighters leave all government departments, and that the 
barricades and checkpoints should be removed from all roads and 
streets leading to the parliament and Council of Ministers 
buildings. Only then will there be an appropriate atmosphere to 
consider convening the parliament so it can exercise its natural 
legislative role in an atmosphere of security and freedom.

Tajikistan's Panj region from neighboring Afghanistan. There 
are no casualties among Russian troops, a military source told 
INTERFAX. No word is given of the number of killed or wounded 
on the rebels' side. 
  There have been as many as four incidents since last Friday 
[20 May] in which Russian forces opened artillery and mortar 
fire on small groups of armed rebels as they tried to infiltrate 
the country along two sections of the Afghan border. None of 
Russian troops were hurt, but there is no word of casualties on 
the rebels' side. 
  Any attempt at illegal border crossing will be suppressed, a 
senior official of the Russian Border Forces in Tajikistan said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Chairman of the Russian 
Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko decided to personally look 
into the state of affairs in the Russian Armed Forces on the eve 
of the upper chamber's examination of the military budget. On 
Friday he left for the Ivanovo region, where a missile army is 
stationed. 
  Shumeyko was accompanied on his trip by commander-in-chief 
of 
the strategic missile troops Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev. The 
missile army is partly armed with the newest "Topol" missile 
system, destined to become the core of Russia's future strategic 
missile forces. 
  Igor Sergeyev told ITAR-TASS that today's talks between the 
missile troops command and Vladimir Shumeyko would center around 
the problems faced by those troops. These problems, he said, 
"are rooted in the share of the budget which is to be allotted 
the strategic missile troops". 
  Shumeyko will be shown the troops' battle capabilities and 
the main components of the training which those who are 
entrusted with the country's nuclear weapons must undergo. The 
Federation Council chairman intends to meet with some of the 
army's officers as well. 
  Sergeyev said he was grateful to Shumeyko for deciding to 
first visit the strategic missile units before making a decision 
on the military budget. "That is explainable, since the Russian 
military doctrine lays the most responsibility for the state's 
safety and stategic stability on our forces. The strategic 
missile troops are the main component of Russia's strategic 
nuclear forces", the general said. 
  He further noted that the many problems encountered by the 
troops are being resolved without compromising their battle 
capabilities and reliability. The strategic missile troops had 
to shoulder most of the responsibility under the START-1 and 
START-2 international disarmament treaties. 
  At present, the commander-in-chief explained, about 60 per 
cent of the rocket carriers and warheads of the strategic 
nuclear forces are concentrated in the missile troops. These 
types of weapons are due to be reduced to one-sixth their former 
size. Sergeyev also pointed out that, even without any 
international treaties, Russia would have to eliminate the 
weapons which used to be produced in the other ex-Soviet 
Republics. 
  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev declared at a recent 
press conference that the country's strategic nuclear forces 
were the main guarantee of Russia's security in the modern 
world. At present as well as in the future, the top priority in 
the development of the armed forces will be given to strategic 
nuclear weapons, which are the main deterrent factor against any 
outbreak of hostilities, he said. 
  The divisions and regiments of the strategic missile troops, 
which are at the centre of the nuclear forces, are now being 
technically reequipped. In the last two years, seven more 
missile regiments have been made battle-capable, all equipped 
with new stationary and mobile missile systems. 
  At the same time, strategic missile units are being 
withdrawn 
from the other ex-Soviet Republics. By the end of 1994, another 
four missile regiments are due to be relocated to Russian 
territory.

  [Text] Moscow May 24 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin 
received visiting British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in the 
Kremlin on Tuesday, the presidential press service reports. 
  The sides discussed European security, cooperation between 
Russia and the west, including NATO's "partnership for peace" 
programme. The president stressed that cooperation between 
Russia and NATO is of mutual interest and should be carried on 
with the understanding of Russia's specific features as a great 
power. 
  Yeltsin expressed hope for the earliest completion of talks 
and the signing of agreements between Russia and the European 
Union on Russia's entry into GATT. He also pointed to the need 
for Russia's full-fledged participation in setting up a new 
organisation on export controls after COCOM ended its functions. 
  In connection with the question on the situation in the 
Crimea, which was raised by Hurd, Yeltsin confirmed Russia's 
known position on this issue: The Crimea's problems should be 
settled between Kiev and Simferopol through negotiations, in 
line with the principles of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, without the use of force. 
  The sides also examined in detail the state of 
Russian-British relations, noting that contacts between the two 
countries are being exercised at an unprecedentedly high level. 
  Hurd conveyed a message to Yeltsin from Queen Elizabeth II 
where her majesty accepts an earlier invitation to make 
history's first official visit to Russia in autumn 1994.

  [Text] Moscow, 24 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Douglas Hurd, British secretary of state 
for foreign and Commonwealth affairs, discussed mainly economic 
issues at a meeting this morning. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin informed the British minister about the 
package of decrees on stepping up structural transformations in 
the Russian economy, which were prepared by the government and 
signed by President Boris Yeltsin Monday. They are designed, in 
particular, to optimize the government's taxation policy and 
attract foreign and Russian capital investments. 
  Douglas Hurd, for his part, noted that after meeting with 
British businessmen in Moscow he arrived at the conclusion that 
business people in his country take an extremely optimistic view 
with regard to the prospects for economic cooperation between 
Russia and Britain. Douglas Hurd confirmed the invitation given 
by British Prime Minister John Major to Viktor Chernomyrdin to 
visit London officially at the end of 1994 or the beginning of 
1995.

  [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- Before flying to Brussels 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev signed a special 
directive which orders heads of all ranks to tighten measures to 
economize on funds allocated for the national defense. 
  First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin and the chief 
department for the military budget and financing of the Defense 
Ministry are assigned to control the implementation of this 
directive, informed sources from the Russian Defense Ministry 
told ITAR-TASS today. 
  The document accentuates that under the conditions of the 
stiff budget it is necessary to maintain the most important 
components ensuring combat efficiency of the Russian Armed 
Forces. 
  At the same time, military experts note, these measures 
taken 
by the defense minister, will hardly save the situation if the 
State Duma (the lower house of the Russian parliament) does not 
agree to increase the military budget from 37.1 trillion roubles 
to at least 55.0 trillion roubles which was approved in 
principle by the duma Defense Committee. 
  In the estimation of the chief department of the military 
budget and financing of the Defense Ministry, in the first four 
months of 1994 the Defense Ministry received about 4 trillion 
roubles which put the Armed Forces and enterprises carrying out 
military orders in an exceptionally complex condition. 
  Military representatives do not agree that they are guided 
by 
narrow departmental interests. Speaking at a news conference on 
a military budget recently held at the State Duma, Andrey 
Kokoshin noted that he was taking measures to resolve the 
current crisis of mutual non-payments by enterprises and 
stimulate the output of high technology products for the civil 
use -- transport, communications, television and power grids -- 
with the aim of increasing the budget revenue item. 
  He explained that in a bid to get a larger sum of 
allocations 
for the defense, experts meant not to increase it but maintain 
this sum of financing at the level of 1993 in comparable prices. 
No less than 60 per cent of these funds will be spent on social 
needs which have considerably grown in connection with the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from republics of the former Soviet 
Union and former socialist countries, and providing them with 
dwellings and amenities. 
  The Russian president, the head of the government and the 
chairman of the Federation Council expressed their agreement in 
principle with the need to increase the defense budget, Andrey 
Kokoshin pointed out. 
  "The 37.1 trillion roubles intended for the defense and 
approved by the State Duma at the first reading will be enough 
only to pay salaries and money allowances to the troops," the 
defense minister told journalists at a news conference on May 
19. "If the Army splits the most awful thing may happen -- 
nobody will be able to stop hungry soldiers," Pavel Grachev 
emphasised.

  [Text] Baku May 24 TASS -- "Azerbaijan intends to look into 
the problem of expanding cooperation with foreign companies in 
the development of oil," said Azeri President Heydar Aliyev 
during a meeting with the British Energy Minister Timothy Eggar 
who arrived in Baku in connection with an international 
exhibition devoted to oil and gas extraction on the Caspian Sea, 
which opens here on May 24. 
  Aliyev expressed satisfaction over the fact that agreements 
on cooperation between the two countries reached during his 
recent visit to Great Britain, and in particular, in the field 
of electric power engineering, were further developed. Aliyev 
said that such cooperation has good prospects, taking into 
account Azerbaijan's huge energy potential. 
  Aliyev said that another round of talks on the development 
of 
the "Azeri" and "Chyrag" deposits jointly with foreign partners 
had been successfully completed in Istanbul on May 20, which 
brought nearer a possibility of signing contracts. 
  For his part, the British minister said that London realises 
the advantages of cooperation with Azerbaijan not only in the 
sphere of oil and gas development, but in other fields, 
including in telecommunications and metal industry. 
  On May 24, Aliyev and Eggar will take part in the opening 
ceremony of an international exhibition organised by British oil 
companies and the Azeri Chamber of Commerce and Industry. On 
display there will be exhibits made by 160 foreign companies 
specialising in the production of equipment for extracting oil 
at sea.

  [Text] The brief meeting between Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in Kiev on 
Tuesday [24 May] will focus on settlement of the Crimean issue. 
This was said by Hurd himself in an interview with INTERFAX in 
Murmansk. 
  Hurd suggested that this issue must be considered within the 
scope of development of friendly relations between Great Britain 
and Ukraine. Hurd recommended that talks on Crimea be held in 
the presence of the Russian party which could contribute to 
better understanding between Kiev and Simferopol through its 
calm and constructive participation. "We hope that both parties 
are reasonable enough to solve the problem by peaceful methods," 
Hurd said.

  [Text] Nikolayev Oblast -- On 22 May, Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk made a working trip to the town of Pervomaysk, 
during the course of which he was at a [Ukrainian poet] 
Shevchenko festival, which took place under the name: "In a 
Free and New Family." After it had ended, Kravchuk replied to 
questions from journalists. 
  Speaking about the actions of Crimea's parliament, which has 
renewed the text of the Republic of Crimea's Constitution in its 
6 May 1992 edition (in particular it is about mutual relations 
between Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of treaties and 
agreements, dual citizenship, and setting up military formations 
on the peninsula's territory), Ukraine's president noted that 
the appeal by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko to the 
world community condemning the position of the Crimean deputies 
had received the support of many international organizations. 
  The head of the Ukrainian state assesses the "Ostankino" 
Television Company's portrayal of the events on the Crimean 
peninsula as the conscious incitement of people to confrontation. 
  Replying to a question regarding the work of Ukraine's 
Supreme Council, Kravchuk emphasized that the beginning was more 
optimistic than the further work of the parliament. "Although 
when we were discussing the Crimea issue in the Supreme Council 
I saw that the majority of deputies had a responsible attitude 
to the Crimean problem." In the opinion of Ukraine's president, 
life will put everything in its place and parliament will occupy 
the proper statesmanlike position. 
  Kravchuk observed that he had not changed his views on the 
presidential election. In this, in particular, he is supported 
by the leadership of Nikolayev and its oblast. "In order to 
elect a president it is necessary to create a legal basis for 
power. Incidentally, Crimea is a vivid confirmation of this. 
Crimea got autonomy in 1990, but the law on the delimitation of 
powers was adopted two years later. In this time the legal 
vacuum was filled, which led to a situation where the 
accumulated political and legal problems may be resolved only by 
returning to a starting position." 
  To a question regarding the truth about our state being 
pushed "from below" toward a federative system, the president 
said that in order to elaborate federative laws one should have 
a professional parliament and work every day for three years.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz has stressed that 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was mistaken on many 
of the issues that he discussed in his article, which he wrote 
from Saudi Arabia, published in THE NEW YORK TIMES on 28 April. 
In a reply published by THE NEW YORK TIMES today, Saturday, 
Tariq 'Aziz explained that the first mistake that Christopher 
committed was his characterization of the states calling for 
lifting the siege imposed on Iraq as just some states. The 
deputy prime minister said that the states calling for a change 
in the policy on Iraq, particularly the immediate lifting of the 
economic blockade, include numerous UN Security Council member 
states, Arab states, and Iraq's neighbors, especially Jordan and 
Turkey, which are suffering from the blockade imposed on Iraq. 
He added that the official statements of the Special Commission 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency conflict with 
Christopher's remarks that Iraq has not complied with its 
commitments toward the UN Security Council. 
  Tariq 'Aziz explained that the UN Security Council failed to 
issue its president's traditional statement because the U.S. 
representative objected to recognizing the progress that has 
been made by Iraq. Meanwhile, he noted, other UN Security 
Council member states, including three permanent members, 
insisted on the need to recognize this progress. He indicated 
that Mr. Christopher's assessments do not represent the 
viewpoints of the majority of the UN Security Council member 
states. 
  Tariq 'Aziz called on the U.S. secretary of state to check 
the U.S. State Department's records to learn of the U.S. 
intervention to prevent Kurdish leaders from signing an 
agreement with the Iraqi Government in the summer of 1991. He 
explained that the Iraqi Government agreed with six Kurdish 
parties, including those led by Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal 
Talabani, on a comprehensive agreement for autonomy in the 
Kurdish region. However, Edward Djerejian, assistant secretary 
of state under James Baker and Warren Christopher, prevented 
Talabani from signing the agreement on the pretext that such an 
agreement would bolster the government of President Saddam 
Husayn. 
  Tariq 'Aziz added that the U.S. State Department's records 
testify to those facts. In addition, all partners to this event 
are still alive. 
  In his reply to Christopher's article, Tariq 'Aziz said that 
the comprehensive blockade imposed on Iraq since 1990 has left 
Iraq with no choice but to depend on itself, especially with 
respect to food production. Therefore, all national resources 
have been mobilized to implement development projects in the 
marshlands area in southern Iraq. He explained that specialized 
U.S., British, Netherlands, and Russian companies studied such 
projects as early as 1950 to reclaim 1.5 million hectares. 
  In a separate development, the deputy prime minister 
stressed 
that a clear progress has been made in the recent UN Security 
Council review of the embargo imposed on Iraq. In statements to 
the director of the Detroit expatriates television aired today, 
Saturday, Tariq 'Aziz said that there is currently a clear 
majority at the UN Security Council adopting a fair position. 
He explained that the U.S. position at the UN Security Council 
uses allegations that do not conform with reality. He said this 
is a position that does not enjoy absolute British support, but 
a limited support for reasons that have nothing to do with UN 
Security Council resolutions. 
  Tariq 'Aziz expressed confidence that the majority of the 
international community now calls for lifting the blockade 
imposed on Iraq. He said that majority of the UN Security 
Council member states, which reflect the majority of the world 
public opinion, have moved toward lifting the blockade. He 
explained that the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait 
worked vigorously before the recent UN Security Council review 
to prevent the council from recognizing the facts. Despite the 
funds that they have spent and despite their false allegations, 
'Aziz added, the majority of the UN Security Council member 
states have adopted positive trend. 
  Relying on facts that he sensed during his recent visit to 
the United Nations, the deputy prime minister expressed 
optimism. He said that after the steadfastness of the Iraqi 
people and their leadership and after facts have become known to 
world public opinion, the call for lifting the blockade is now 
stronger than ever before. 
  On the situation in northern Iraq, Tariq 'Aziz told the 
expatriates television that it is an anomalous situation imposed 
by foreign powers on our Kurdish people and in which armed 
groups took part. He said that those groups are behaving 
irresponsibly and without any consideration for the interests of 
our Kurdish people or for the general national interests. He 
explained that the fighting raging between the Barzani and 
Talabani groups has resulted in hundreds of deaths and in 
disrupting life and public services. Meanwhile, he said, foreign 
U.S. and Iranian interventions are taking place, in addition to 
the Turkish air raids on villages in the area. 
  The deputy prime minister stressed that the northern part of 
the homeland must return to the homeland, and that the 
authority, law, and security must return to the region which 
flourished under autonomy and under the national Iraqi 
leadership.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 24, ELTA -- Russian Federation Embassy 
in Lithuania gave over to ELTA the statement of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry concerning the 4th session of the Baltic 
Assembly. 
  The statement said: "The results of the 4th session of the 
Baltic Assembly have confirmed Russia's fears that normalization 
and further development of relations between Russia and the 
three Baltic countries were not included into the plans of 
certain political forces in these states. 
  "Although there are real problems concerning the situation 
of 
the Russian-speaking population in Latvia and Estonia... 
parliamentaries of the three countries decided to accept the so 
called common statement 'On Russia's pressure on the Baltic 
states'. It is quite evident they were not looking for 
constructive decisions, necessary for the negotiations with 
Estonia, but were led by purely political motives. 
  "The resolution on the relations with Russian Federation 
went 
even further. Calling Russia to admit there are 'unresolved 
territorial questions' and to bear the responsibility for damage 
done to the Baltic states since 1940 and to compensate it, the 
parliamentaries made a dangerous step -- they are trying to 
transfer events of these years from historical plane to that of 
financial, material, etc. claims to Russian Federation, 
although Russia is not and will not be responsible for actions 
made by Stalin's regime. 
  "The Baltic Assembly proved some Baltic politicians try to 
find new pretexts to base their anti-Russian policies instead of 
historical estimations of the past events", the statement said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow May 24 -- "To reinforce the ceasefire 
agreement in the area of conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, it is 
necessary for all the conflicting parties to take clear and 
definite measures to demonstrate their aspiration to turn this 
pause into a stable truce and move ahead to solving disputable 
issues by peaceful, negotiatory means," said Grigory Karasin, 
spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry. 
  According to him, the ceasefire agreement reached on May 12 
by military chiefs of the belligerents through Russia's 
mediation and encouragement on the part of Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe "is being observed in the 
main". "Only separate incidents" of small-scale fighting occured 
since then, he added. 
  "Expressing our satisfaction with the fact that bloodshed 
has 
been stopped for the time being, we would like to see that the 
parties concerned thus showed, first and foremost, their 
political resolve to cease military operations and confirm their 
ability to fulfil their commitments," Karasin emphasized. 
  In view of the fact that previous ceasefire agreements were 
repeatedly violated by this or that party, these features are of 
special significance. 
  Karasin regretted the fact that "certain political forces 
and 
leaders try to create crisis situations for the sake of their 
self- serving interests at this decisive moment (in the fate) of 
the peoples involved in the conflict." 
  "It is time we determined, who comes out for peaceful 
settlement of the conflict and who - for resumption of 
hostilities, for return into the bloody impasse," Karasin 
pointed out.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, May 25 (ITAR-TASS) -- "After issuing three 
documents -- a presidential message, a mini-message on 
non-payments of April 12 as well as a document on civic accord," 
the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes, "the president again 
took the initiative of running the economy and reform into his 
own hands. 
  "This action is connected with the president's wish to 
establish full control over actions by the premier and the 
entire economic bloc of the government and to deprive the 
cabinet of any independence, including independence of a 
political manoeuvre." 
  Amplifying this theme, the ROSSIISKIE VESTI newspaper notes 
that "in the political respect, the president's 'economic' 
decrees gave a pretext for suppositions that he is forced to 
'prod' the passive government, thrusting on it his 
'strong-willed' decisions which were made all of a sudden". 
  "According to information received at the presidential press 
service," the newspaper writes in another article, "Boris 
Yeltsin will meet the leadership of the Russian Government this 
week in order to analyse the progress of economic reform and to 
map out measures to remove 'bottlenecks' in its way." 
  "Despite expectations, the Moscow talks between the Russian 
and Ukrainian premiers," writes the NOVAYA EZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA 
newspaper, "centred not on the conflict between Simferopol and 
Kiev but on the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  "The sides stressed proximity and importance of these themes 
in bilateral relations. Although the discussion has not brought 
specific results, the cabinet heads appraised the meeting rather 
optimistically." 
  The same newspaper writes in another article that "Russia 
should not fully rely on the Baykonur Cosmodrome as the main 
launching pad for Russian space explorations in future. 
  "This is true even of the next 20 years about which the two 
presidents (eds: Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev) talked 
in Moscow. Governments were changing in the recent past more 
often than space rockets." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Vladimir 
Gusev, 
head of the Russian federal tax service, who said that "the 
state collected taxes worth over 38,000 billion rubles and 340 
million U.S. dollars for 1993". 
  The same newspaper features an interview with Vadim Gustov, 
chairman of the Russian parliament upper house committee on the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, saying that "economy 
dictates its rules to politicians. 
  "These are stiff rules. Politicians should start thinking 
how to pool efforts, natural resources, workforce and the 
intellectual potential in order to pull out of the crisis. 
  "It is clear for all that there is no way back to the former 
centralised rigid system of management. It means that we should 
look for another way, to find versions acceptable for all, to 
come to agreement. 
  "It can be a Eurasian Union proposed by Nazarbayev or 
something else. However, it is necessary to start preparing now 
a legislative basis for it as well as a concept for cooperation 
and manageability of economies." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with speaker of the 
former Russian parliament Ruslan Khasbulatov, saying: "Serious 
praiseworthy opposition leaders are doomed to take a peaceful 
road and to act in compliance with law. But it is highly 
probable that authorities will reply with artillery volleys to 
their constructive initiatives". 
  The TRUD newspaper informs its readers that "head of the 
Russian president's office Sergey Filatov submitted documents to 
the government about gold reserves of the Russian empire stored 
abroad. 
  "The documents are supplied with Filatov's recommendation to 
set up an interdepartmental commission to return gold home." 
  According to the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper, "the 
Russian 
president will hear counterintelligence officers on Wednesday to 
hammer out a single concept for their operations. 
  "It happened that starting from the year 1991, victorious 
for 
democracy, Russia had no common doctrine for the country's 
security, including the sphere of shielding against foreign 
secret services. 
  "Confidential sources at the federal conterintelligence 
service inform that precisely this reason prompted the general 
summit of Russian counterintelligence leaders." 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper carries an interview with 
Anatoliy Golovnev, deputy commander-in-chief of Russian land 
forces, who stresses: "The quality of training troops suffers 
due to the untimely development and delivery by the Ministry of 
the Munitions Industry of simulators to new models of weapons 
and combat materiel. 
  "The cost of weapons grows, since we are forced to train on 
combat materiel. How soon will the situation change for the 
better? This depends on how soon we agree that the state's might 
is also a level of its army's training." 
  The PRAVDA newspaper writes that "an official report that 
five prominent Latvian politicians had been KGB agents, became a 
real sensation in Latvia. The republican prosecutor-general 
made recently this report to local legislators. 
  "Incumbent foreign minister G. Andreyevs is among the above 
five. True, the final say belongs to the court of law. However, 
all the five are now vehemently deny their former affiliation 
with the KGB."

  [Text] Moscow, 25 May (Business-TASS) -- The State Duma 
committee on economic policy has spoken in favor of increasing 
Russia's military expenditure in 1994 to up to 55 trillion 
rubles, thus supporting the Duma's defense committee on this. 
If the State Duma were to approve this initiative during the 
debates of the budget in its second reading, the overall 
increase for national defense would exceed the original sum by 
17.9 trillion rubles. The proposal to increase Russia's 
military expenditure to up to 55 trillion rubles was supported 
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

  [Text] Moscow May 25 TASS -- The Liberal-Democratic Party 
faction today returned to the hall of the State Duma (lower 
chamber of the Russian parliament) from which it demonstratively 
walked out last Friday. However, its members refused to 
register or to take part in the voting. 
  Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy told the Duma that no 
measures against the "Podrobnosty" (Details) programme of the 
Russian TV, on which the faction insisted, were taken so far. 
"Therefore, the faction refuses to take part in the Duma's work 
until it shows who wields the power in the country," 
Zhirinovskiy said. 
  Addressing Ivan Rybkin, who chaired the session, 
Zhirinovskiy 
stated: "Either you will show that there is a parliament in 
Russia or you will see that a part of it is already gone, that 
you have already lost it". 
  Rybkin stressed, in turn, that the parliament would like to 
base its relations with the mass media on the existing laws. 
Recalling about the resolution of the Duma council, addressed 
to the leader of the Russian TV company Oleg Poptsov, he said 
that the State Duma had not received any official answer to the 
resolution. Rybkin said that the Duma legal department had 
contacted the court for informational disputes under the Russian 
president and its chairman Anatoliy Vengerov, who explained that 
the collision, caused by journalist Nikolay Svanidze's 
pronouncements, was within the competence of the court. Rybkin 
moved to settle it by legal means. He urged the 
Liberal-Democratic faction to take part in the work of the 
chamber even though the conflict with the mass media was not 
settled yet.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report in the "Regions" column: "The Duma </F>
Is Only Content with the `Steppe Code.' Sergey Shakhray Is 
Sure: the Russian Federation Constitution Is Not a Bronze 
Monument"] 
  [Text] Opening parliamentary hearings on the issue of 
compatibility of the constitutions of the republics and the 
charters of the territories as part of the Russian Federation, 
Vladimir Lysenko called on the few participants to look at the 
experience of China which, according to him, "has created a 
liberal market economy, preserved a communist ideology and 
thereby ensured the country's integrity." The thrust of Mr. 
Lysenko's complaints against the republican constitutions was 
that some of them enshrine what he sees as excessive 
independence. An ideal regional constitution, "which draws 
virtually no criticisms at all," is, in Mr. Lysenko's view, 
Kalmykia's Steppe Code [Stepnoye ulozheniye] (Kirsan Ilyumshinov 
even proposed that his republic be equated to a governorate). A 
deputy from Tataria, Mr. Lazovoy, objected to this: "If there 
are so many constitutions which contradict the Russian 
Constitution, is it not easier to change it then?" 
  Federal Council Committee Chairman Vasiliy Tarasenko sharply 
disagreed with "the introduction of a treaty-based system" in 
relations between the center and the regions. Bilateral 
agreements between Moscow and individual republics, in his 
opinion, create "a legal system that runs parallel with the 
constitution." The senator complained: The economically 
stronger krays and oblasts "are justly annoyed by the fact that 
the republics are in a privileged position." 
  The sole "high guest" at the hearings -- Sergey Shakhray -- 
on the other hand advocated wide dissemination of "Tataria's 
experience." According to him, the contradictions between the 
republics' constitutions and the federal Fundamental Law must be 
adjusted through bilateral treaties. In parting, Mr. Shakhray 
said that the Russian Constitution itself "is not a bronze 
monument either..." 
  Representatives of approximately 20 regions took part in the 
hearings, mainly of rank no higher than deputy chairmen, deputy 
chiefs, or advisers.

  [Text] Kiev, 24 May (ITAR-TASS) -- At the talks taking 
place in Kiev between delegations of the Ukrainian Supreme 
Soviet and the Crimean parliament, the basis of a mechanism for 
settlement of the Crimean conflict has been laid. This was said 
today by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk when he received 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd who has arrived in 
Ukraine on a one-day official visit. 
  "I must stress yet again," Leonid Kravchuk noted, "that 
Crimea is an autonomous part of Ukraine." "We want to act 
within the framework of the Ukrainian Constitution, not to 
resort to force, and we are insisting that the authorities in 
the Crimea also act within its framework," he stated, having 
called on Russia to support Ukraine in this.

  The sides agreed to recommend the Ukrainian and Crimean

called on the Crimean deputies to consider a suspended validity 
of the decisions, which restored the 1992 Constitution loosening 
the Crimea's links with Ukraine, for three days. 
  Crimean Parliament Speaker Sergey Tsekov told a news 
conference upon the negotiations completion that the "Republic 
of the Crimea does not plan to separate from Ukraine. This can 
be said only by those who know nothing about the content of the 
Crimean legislative acts". 
  In his opinion, a single legislative act should be adopted 
to 
achieve eternal stability in Ukrainian-Crimean relations. This 
may be an agreement between Ukraine and the Crimea, and the 
working group should discuss this problem.

  [Text] Kiev, 24 May -- "To examine within three days the 
issue of suspending for the duration of activity by the joint 
working group the validity of the acts passed by the Supreme 
Councils of Ukraine and Crimea on 20 May 1994." This was a 
proposal made to the parliaments of Ukraine and the Crimean 
autonomy by the Supreme Council of Ukraine commission for 
problems of a settlement to the situation in Crimea, led by 
Borys Oliynyk. It is, in particular, said in the final 
document, read aloud at a news conference on the results of a 
consultative meeting between the Supreme Council of Ukraine 
commission and a Supreme Council of Crimea delegation, headed by 
Borys Oliynyk and Supreme Council of Crimea chairman Serhiy 
Tsekov, respectively: "The Supreme Council of Crimea delegation 
informed the Supreme Council of Ukraine commission of the 
situation in Crimea, that arose after the adoption by the 
Republic of Crimea Supreme Council of the laws and other 
legislative acts of 20 May 1994. In the course of an exchange 
of opinions, it was stated that there lacked conformity between 
the above documents and the Constitution and legislation in 
force in Ukraine, and there existed inefficiency in decisions by 
the supreme bodies of legislative and executive power in Ukraine 
and Crimea being put into practice. Participants in the meeting 
were unanimous in acknowledging the necessity of effective steps 
to be taken with the aim of achieving the stabilization of the 
situation and the most effective resolution of Crimea's 
socioeconomic problems. It was emphasized that the mass media 
were not always objective in their coverage of events. It was 
decided to recommend that the Supreme Councils of Ukraine and 
the Republic of Crimea should set up the Ukrainian and Crimean 
Supreme Councils' joint working group for proposals to be 
coordinated and submitted for consideration by the former 
bodies." 
  In the opinion of Serhiy Tsekov, Republic of Crimea Supreme 
Council chairman, the meeting was held in a difficult situation, 
which was influenced by the latest events in Crimea. "We believe 
that this situation was caused not only by the adoption of 
relevant legislative acts by the Supreme Councils of Crimea and 
Ukraine but also by inconsistency in actions by politicians on 
Crimean issues in the course of the past two years." In Serhiy 
Tsekov's words, the work of the group will help resolve the 
Crimean problem so that differences in relations between Ukraine 
and Crimea will not occur invariably. "We want stability in 
Crimea and we want stability in Ukraine as a whole," said the 
Supreme Council of Crimea chairman. 
  As for the final goal of the Russia bloc, which is to 
reunite 
Crimea with the Russian Federation, Serhiy Tsekov expressed the 
hope that in the future Crimea would join Russia together with 
the State of Ukraine. The main point in a future treaty with 
Ukraine, in the view of the autonomy's parliamentary chairman, 
should be the delegation of powers by Crimea to Ukraine and not 
the other way round. Borys Oliynyk pointed out that the Supreme 
Council's resolution on bringing Crimea's legislation in line 
with the Ukrainian constitution within the term of 10 days was 
remaining in force and that the mechanisms of appropriate 
executive structures were continuing to function under the 
procedure established. 
  The Crimean delegation leaves for Crimea on 24 May.

<F P=106> ["Part" of speech by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to </F>
the Council of the Organization of Veterans in Kiev on 24 May-- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Kravchuk on Ukrainian-Russian relations and 
Crimea: Part one (stand on Crimea) 
  The Council of the Organization of Veterans held a plenum on 
24 May to discuss arrangements to mark the 50th anniversary of 
Ukraine's liberation from Nazi occupation and the 50th 
anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War [World War II 
on Soviet territory]. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, 
Minister of Defense Vitaliy Radetskyy, National Guard Commander 
Volodymyr Kukharets, and other state officials attended the 
meeting. Considering the importance of the president's address 
in terms of various problems in Ukraine's domestic and foreign 
policy, we are broadcasting the larger part of the speech. 
  [Kravchuk] [passage omitted] I am grateful to the 
Organization of Veterans for raising the issue of Crimea and 
offering to address the people of Ukraine on this issue because 
your words and your voice will have a great impact. I am not 
exaggerating. [Words indistinct] the situation is developing as 
follows: We are acting in accordance with the Constitution and 
the law. By we, I mean the president and the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine. Believe me, I have not violated Ukraine's Constitution 
and legislation so far. The Supreme Council resolution passed 
last Friday [20 May] fully accords with the Constitution and the 
law on delimitation of powers between the authorities in Crimea 
and Kiev and with the law on citizenship. No one violated 
anything. We will continue to act within the framework of the 
Constitution, within the framework of the legislation, while our 
power structures follow the laws and the norms adopted in 
Ukraine. 
  We proceed from the main premise that Crimea is a 
constituent 
part of Ukraine. This has been recognized worldwide. On the 
way here, I received reports from the world's biggest powers: 
the United States of America, Great Britain, Germany. The 
Russian foreign minister also declared this. They all are 
united in the opinion that Ukraine's territorial integrity is a 
fact of life, Ukraine's sovereignty cannot be violated, and that 
the defense of territorial integrity, inviolability of borders, 
and a country's sovereignty is a sacred duty of every individual 
and every state. This is the bottom line, which no one is 
allowed to cross. This is, as they say, the red line. When we 
are involved in a discussion with Crimea, we say: Recognition 
of the basic fact that Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine, 
and the same constitution and laws apply on its territory as on 
the territory of Ukraine, open the door to any compromise, and 
any economic, social, and political solutions. 
  But Crimea and its leadership [words indistinct] are also 
violating their own laws, that is, laws enacted in Crimea, and 
not only Ukrainian laws. Naturally, in this situation it is 
difficult to take the settlement of the issue into the legal 
framework. 
  Our delegation, led by Acting Prime Minister Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy, has gone to Moscow to settle the issue of the Black 
Sea Fleet, which is very acute. There is some progress, and 
there are difficulties. I hope, however, that both Russia and 
Ukraine will have enough diplomatic ability and that their 
attitude toward the situation will be sufficiently politically 
discerning--taking into account all possible positive and 
negative consequences--to resolve this problem properly in order 
first to preserve peace in Crimea and second not to become an 
apple of contention, as it were, between us; and for us to 
settle it in a way that would make friendship, partnership, and 
cooperation with our great neighbor Russia determine our policy 
and be a priority in it. 
  You yourselves can see that this does not depend entirely on 
Ukraine's position. I cannot help but talk today about the wild 
and untruthful information that the Russian mass media is 
disseminating. The mass media, however, is the mass media. 
  I cannot help but tell this audience, which is composed of 
experienced, politically balanced, and intelligent people, that 
the rhetoric at the state level in Russia, at the level of 
representative and state power, is unacceptable to Ukraine. All 
sorts of hints, all sorts of warnings to the president of 
Ukraine cannot be recognized by the civilized world as according 
with international norms if one should be guided by these norms. 
Any president can issue warnings to his own structures, his own 
ministers, his own government, and state and other structures 
subordinate to him, but not to the president of another state. 
This is not fitting. It is not a democratic approach and does 
not do any credit to anyone resorting to it. 
  I want to be understood: I cannot help but pay attention to 
such things when Mr. Sergey Filatov hints that someone provoked 
the problems in Crimea in order to retain power. I would like 
to know whose opinion is this? Is it Filatov's personal 
opinion, or his opinion as chief of presidential staff, or is it 
someone else's opinion? This is a serious issue. We do not 
allow ourselves any attacks at the state level against our 
neighbor, a state with which we want friendly, equal, 
partnerlike relations for good, not for one day. Everyone must 
consider that.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said that 
statements by different Russian politicians towards Ukraine were 
"not in conformity with international standards." For instance, 
Kravchuk criticized the statement of Russian Kremlin Chief of 
Staff Sergey Filatov who had suggested that development of the 
Crimean conflict was beneficial for the presidential structures 
in Kiev since they were interested in postponement of the 
presidential elections. 
  Kravchuk wondered whether this was a personal point of view 
of Filatov or the official position of the Russian leadership. 
  Commenting on the recent statement by Russian President 
Boris 
Yeltsin who had warned Kravchuk that no force must be used in 
Crimea, Kravchuk said that the president could warn his own 
structures but not the president of other state. Kravchuk said 
that such warning also contradicted "international standards." 
  Kravchuk confirmed that Ukraine was acting in accordance 
with 
the Ukrainian constitution.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- At 1000 [0700 GMT] on 
24 May, a parliamentary delegation from Supreme Council of 
Crimea led by Serhiy Tsekov, parliamentary chairman and a former 
people's deputy of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, arrived at 
the Supreme Council of Ukraine. According to unofficial 
information, a private meeting between Serhiy Tsekov and Borys 
Oliynyk, who heads the Ukrainian parliamentary delegation, was 
held prior to the beginning of Ukrainian-Crimean parliamentary 
negotiations. 
  Serhiy Holovatyy and Oleksandr Skipalskyy, members of the 
Ukrainian delegation, informed a UNIAN correspondent that no 
decision on any issue was made as of 1700 [1400 GMT]. 
  Commenting on the current situation, Volodymyr Hrynyov, 
cochairman of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms, said that what 
the Crimean parliament did demonstrates that the first step 
toward Ukraine's federative structure has been taken. He 
believes that the only appropriate way out of the situation is 
to follow the example of Russia and Tatarstan, which did not 
allow the situation to escalate. V. Hrynyov believes that 
Ukraine must use that example because, except for a federation, 
he can see no other way. "You cannot hide the truth, and that it 
had to be this way was clear as long ago as when the previous 
Supreme Council passed the law "on delimiting powers between the 
state bodies of Ukraine and Crimea." 
  Volodymyr Hrynyov believes that compromise can cause furious 
disagreement in the parliament. 
  From Simferopol: Viktor Mezhak, deputy chairman of the 
Supreme Council of Crimea Praesidium and leader of the People's 
Party of Crimea, told a UNIAN correspondent on 24 May that the 
Crimean delegation at the negotiations in Kiev intended to press 
for strict compliance with the law "on delimiting powers between 
Ukraine and Crimea" and, in particular, on the annulment of the 
Ukrainian presidential directives on reorganizing the Crimean 
Internal Affairs and Justice Ministries and the Security 
Service. He said the formation of Crimean authorities was the 
prerogative of the Republic of Crimea, as well as on the 
obligatory provision for the Crimean side of information on any 
Ukrainian troop movements on the territory of the peninsula, and 
so on. The Crimean delegation will also demand that the the 
office of the Ukrainian presidential representative in Crimea be 
disbanded.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Sergey Karmalito </F>
and Lev Ryabchikov] 
  [Text] Simferopol, 24 May -- It was decided today to set up 
a Ukrainian-Crimean parliamentary working party to consider 
contentious issues surrounding the restoration of the 
Constitution of the Republic of Crimea, as worded on 6 May 1992. 
The decision was taken at a meeting in Kiev between delegations 
from the two parliaments. 
  Viktor Mezhak, deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme 
Council 
reported that representatives from the Ukrainian parliament were 
expected to arrive in Simferopol on Friday [27 May]. It was 
recognized that it would be more sensible to hold the dialogue 
in Crimea, since such contradictory information is being 
received about the situation here. We think that the mutual 
understanding found in Kiev will be strengthened, he said. 
  According to Mezhak, the Crimean delegation considered it 
particularly important to set out its point of view as clearly 
and as specifically as possible: There is no question of 
redrawing Ukraine's borders. Political integration within the 
framework of the CIS sets a good example, the deputy chairman of 
the Crimean Supreme Council stressed, Crimea cannot survive 
without Ukraine but relations must be built on equal terms.

  [Text] Sevastopol [no date as received] -- A UNIAN 
correspondent learned today from reliable sources close to the 
Black Sea Fleet staff that a Black Sea Fleet marine infantry 
brigade has been brought to a "military danger" state of 
increased combat readiness. In accordance with this degree of 
combat readiness, the personnel have been issued with weapons, 
dressings, and bullet-proof vests and have been confined to 
barracks. Duties are increased for the purpose of emergency 
reaction to changes in the operational situation. 
  The declaration of "military danger" in the brigade 
continues 
the series of combat preparations. The Black Sea Fleet Command 
decided even earlier to transfer a tank battalion and a surface 
to air missile battalion to the brigade in Sevastopol.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondent Sergey Karmalito] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol, 25 May -- The formation of a Ukrainian 
National Guard brigade in the Crimea numbering 2,500 to 3,000 
men is continuing. This was stated today in an exclusive 
interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent by Major General 
Valeriy Kuznetsov, the minister of internal affairs of the 
Crimean republic. In his words, claims that the armored 
vehicles that had been moved to Simferopol the other day had 
been under repair and had now gone to their places of previous 
deployment, were at variance with reality. In fact, they have 
been handed over to the Ukrainian National Guard brigade which 
is being formed in Sevastopol and Simferopol and includes 
subunits of the Special Forces. 
  V.Kuznetsov drew attention to the fact that this kind of 
military build-up was "not necessary and not typical" for the 
Crimea, which was already "oversaturated with military 
formations and combat equipment" as it was. At the same time, 
he pointed out that moves are being made on the part of the 
Ukraine to win over and test the ground in army units as to the 
readiness of the personnel in the event of an emergency being 
introduced in the Crimea. It is essentially a question of 
possible interference by the army and National Guard if the 
situation deteriorates. At the same time, attempts are being 
continued to split the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] of the 
Crimean Republic by creating a Chief Administration subordinated 
to Kiev. So far, V.Kuznetsov said, the unity of the MVD is 
being maintained. In our view, he continued, the best thing is 
to tackle all the disputed questions at the negotiating table. 
Russia's treaty with Tatarstan and current dialogue with 
Chechnya could serve as an example, "especially," the Crimean 
minister of internal affairs stressed, "as we are not declaring 
that we are ceasing to form part of the Ukraine or reviewing the 
existing frontiers."

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Meshkov, president of the Crimean </F>
Republic, by Karol Wrubel; place and date not given: "A Happy 
Place..."] 
  [Text] [Wrubel] When you were elected president, fears 
intensified that Crimea might become another conflict area on 
the territory of the former Soviet Union. You are definitely in 
favor of stronger ties with Russia, even though your Republic 
has been part of Ukraine since 1954. How would you like to 
prevent the possibility of exacerbating the conflict over Crimea? 
  [Meshkov] The only way to avert such a conflict is to force 
the Ukrainian authorities to implement the commitments that they 
have made. For the time being, however, we have been witnessing 
something entirely contrary. 
  [Wrubel] What do you mean: to force? 
  [Meshkov] The current elite in Kiev is busy trying to figure 
out how to stay in power. However, it is no longer supported by 
the people. The Ukrainian people were sentenced to living in 
poverty. There are attempts to take advantage of the upcoming 
50th anniversary of the deportation of the Crimean Tartars to 
aggravate the conflict. Under the pretext that public order is 
jeopardized, additional military units are being dispatched to 
our territory. We used to have 18,000 soldiers whereas now we 
have as many as 60,000. Who needs this? We are concerned about 
the economy, but what we get are military echelons, tanks, 
special units, and flame throwers. In addition, the United 
States and other countries are being appealed to for support. 
This may bring about inestimable consequences. 
  [Wrubel] Your movement is being accused of promoting Russian 
nationalism, of separatism, and sometimes even of political 
hooliganism. 
  [Meshkov] The motives of our activities have nothing to do 
with nationalism. On the contrary; the goal of our policy is to 
protect Crimea from an increase in nationalistic feelings. 
  [Wrubel] Is the support given to you by Russia sufficient? 
  [Meshkov] Most important for us is the support of our own 
people, of the inhabitants of Crimea. As far as Russia is 
concerned, we would certainly be happy if its official policy 
were firmer. Nonetheless, we understand, of course, that this 
is not always possible and that Moscow's stand depends on many 
various factors. 
  [Wrubel] The forces that are giving support to you in Russia 
do not call up good associations. Those forces are accused of 
chauvinism and enmity toward reforms. 
  [Meshkov] Crimea is the happy place on earth where there is 
no nationalism. Any attempts by external forces to arouse it 
will be abortive, both now and in the future. Thus, the support 
given to us by extreme groups will not in any way decide the 
character of our ambitions. Moreover, we are supported by 
various forces -- first of all by people who are concerned about 
the development of the situation in Crimea. 
  [Wrubel] Many of your decrees have been annulled by 
President Kravchuk. Recently Kiev has opposed the changes in 
the posts of the minister of security and the minister of 
internal affairs -- both changes were made by you. Your powers 
are subject to quite considerable limitations, then? 
  [Meshkov] Both of these cases are the best illustration of 
the conditions in which we are conducting our activities. We 
are getting ready for the implementation of an economic reform, 
whereas Kiev is employing forceful methods in order to aggravate 
the conflict. The minister of internal affairs breached 
official discipline and the Crimea Republic did not receive even 
a small portion of the information that the security services 
were sending over to Kiev. Now, this apparatus should work 
first of all for its own Republic, even if it considered it to 
be part of Ukraine. Therefore, I had to appoint new ministers. 
  [Wrubel] One of the best-known Crimean problems is the issue 
of Tartars, whose leaders are rather critical of your program. 
What do you think needs to be done to resolve the problem of 
Tartars? 
  [Meshkov] The issue of how this problem should be resolved 
is decided in the general declaration of human rights. Crimean 
citizens of Tartar nationality have suffered wrongs that should 
be compensated to them. Unfortunately, the Crimean Republic is 
not in a position to bear the financial burden of a just 
resolution of this problem. This is why we need help. However, 
also in this case I would like to stress that there is not at 
all an undercurrent of nationalism in the present difficulties 
linked to the resolution of the Tartar problem. 
  [Wrubel] The Russian minister of defense and his Ukrainian 
counterpart, who held negotiations in Sevastopol on the Black 
Sea fleet, considered your participation in the talks to be 
undesirable. Did you feel offended? 
  [Meshkov] I could feel personally offended, but this would 
not be rational behavior. However, the situation looks 
different if we perceive this event as an illustration of the 
attitude toward Crimea's president. It is a requirement of 
diplomatic protocol that defense ministers visiting some 
administrative unit advise, at least its authorities, that they 
are coming. However, even if the president of Crimea is shown 
disrespect, it must be remembered that it is not possible to 
show disrespect to the people who have elected him.

  [Text] As one should have expected, the 20 May decision by 
the Crimean parliament to restore the main provisions of the 
1992 Constitution provoked a quite negative and tough reaction 
on the part of official Kiev. It is not surprising that events 
on the peninsula have become the main story of news agencies 
over the past few days. My colleague, Anton Grishin, reports on 
the latest from the region: 
  [Begin Grishin recording] It looks as if an attempt on the 
part of the presidents of Ukraine and Russia to cool tempers has 
led nowhere. A statement by Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy 
Radetskyy cast doubts on the verbal agreements reached on 
abstaining from the use of force to settle the Crimean conflict. 
According to Radetskyy, I quote, official Kiev will take no one 
and nothing into consideration in preserving the Crimea within 
Ukraine and will opt for the most decisive measures to do 
so--end of quote. It became known on Monday [23 May] that 29 
armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were moved into 
Simferopol. The strength of the military contingent was 
considerably increased. This prompted the Crimean law 
enforcement bodies to be confined to barracks and all vitally 
important facilities in the republic be placed under guard. [end 
recording] 
  Yevgeniy Novikov reports from Simferopol: 
  [Begin Novikov recording] During the afternoon, the Crimean 
president's administration began receiving information from 
Simferopol residents on the movement of Ukrainian military 
equipment through the town. Worrying reports were coming from 
the Crimean Ministry of Internal Affairs. However, by the end 
of the day on 23 May, no Ukrainian military equipment was found 
on the streets of Simferopol. Obviously, this equipment is on 
the territory of the military units in Simferopol. The Crimean 
president's administration reported that the officials of 
Simferopol are refraining from action and are awaiting the 
results of talks between the prime ministers of Ukraine and 
Russia on the Crimean problem. In the meantime, passengers of 
long-distance trains continue to supply contradictory 
information on the movement of Ukrainian military trains in the 
border regions of the northern Crimea. [end recording]

  [Text] Kharkov, 24 May -- Ukraine's railroad industry is on 
the brink of bankruptcy, Oleksandr Puchkov, head of Southern 
Railroads [Pivdenna Zaliznytsya] told UNIAR. "Considering the 
present conditions, we should have laid off at least 30,000 
Southern Railroads employees. Railroad workers have not been 
paid since January. The railroad used to get its main profit 
from freight which accounted for 90 percent of the entire 
workload. But now freight makes up only 21 percent of the 
business, with 79 percent taken up by passenger and commuter 
travel and overall traffic constantly declining. The situation 
is the same on Ukraine's five other railroad networks."

<F P=106> [Report by Sviltana Viktorova on former parliamentary </F>
speaker Ivan Plyushch's meeting with journalists; place and date 
not given: "To Organize or Disorganize Elections?"] 
  [Text] An assessment of the first week of work of 
Ukraine's new Supreme Council, legislative collisions, the 
course of the presidential election campaign as well as of the 
campaign for the election of local bodies of government and 
self-government, and interrelations between branches of power -- 
these and other questions were discussed by Ivan Plyushch, 
Ukraine's people's deputy and chairman of Ukraine's Supreme 
Council of the preceding convocation, during a meeting with 
journalists. 
  "Of course, Ukraine's Supreme Council has demonstrated its 
striving to proceed, as soon as possible, to considering topical 
problems in the life of our society in order to open up a wide 
road for economic reforms." This is the general assessment of 
the beginning of the work of the session given by Ivan Plyushch. 
"However, no matter how much we would want to separate politics 
from the economy and the economy from politics, it is impossible 
because it is meaningless to expect that economic reforms will 
be implemented before political reforms are completed." 
  Nor can we bypass organizational questions. One of them, in 
the opinion of Ivan Plyushch, is the approval of powers of the 
deputies by the credentials committee, as is stipulated by the 
Constitution. It is only after the mandates of the deputies are 
approved that decrees and laws adopted by the parliament may be 
considered valid. I. Plyushch stressed that the provisional 
credentials committee acted in conformity with the current 
legislation and in conformity with the constitution. It made a 
proposal, but the discussion and voting did not proceed quite 
consistently. As Ivan Stepanovych [Plyushch] pointed out, it 
was not quite ethical either. It would have been correct if, 
after recognizing the powers of the 331 deputies, the parliament 
had resolved to adopt the decree as a foundation and put its 
every item to the vote. The deviations from the procedure and 
procedural violations led to an ethical failure. The voting 
results could be the same, but the procedures would be observed. 
However, it so happened that the results were not achieved in 
the best possible way, and the parliament could be accused of 
excessive politicization, settlement of accounts, and 
unconstitutional character. However, on the last day of the 
past working week, the parliament adopted the right decision, 
having authorized the provisional credentials committee to 
continue clarifying the reasons why elections in electoral 
districts Nos. 367 and 300 were considered to be valid or 
invalid and then adopt an ultimate decision. 
  As regards those clauses in the Ukrainian presidential 
message to the parliament where the inexpediency of holding 
elections of local power bodies and presidential elections is 
argued, Ivan Plyushch, in his talk with the journalists, 
chronologically accounted for the course of arriving at the 
decision on holding parliamentary, local council, and 
presidential elections. He recalled, in particular, L. 
Kravchuk's statement on the need for such elections. L. 
Kravchuk said the following: My opinion is that, taking into 
account the difficult situation and the fact that all branches 
of power do not have sufficient authority and, one can even say, 
that they have a very low prestige, it is necessary to hold 
elections at all levels. It is normal. That is why, to resolve 
this question, we must adopt, in this audience, a decree on 
early elections to all branches of power, including the 
president. Let us not waste time and not make allusions as to 
who is to blame and who is not to blame. People themselves will 
make a choice: If they elect left-wingers, the left wing will 
come to power; if they elect right-wingers, the right wing will 
come to power; if they elect centrists, then centrists will come 
to power and will govern Ukraine. The main thing is to have a 
state. 
  There were also the following words by the Ukrainian 
president: "Before my voters and before the whole nation, I 
declare from the Supreme Council's podium that, on the day when 
the new parliament convenes for its first session, I will turn 
to it with a request to organize Ukrainian presidential 
elections." 
  Now, stressed I. Plyushch, read Leonid Makarovych 
[Kravchuk]'s appeal to the parliament and you will see whether 
he seeks to organize or rather disorganize elections, something 
that he has been doing for the last three months. In January, 
when the Supreme Council discussed the question on holding a 
referendum on the main constitutional principles of organizing 
the state power and Leonid Makarovych was already at the Supreme 
Council's podium, a deputy asked him a question: "Will you 
agree to being re-elected as president in June?" L. Kravchuk: 
"The Supreme Council has adopted a decree." Voices from the 
audience: "Will there be presidential elections?" L. Kravchuk: 
"This is not up to me to decide, this question has already been 
resolved. The Supreme Council adopted a decree. Why are you 
asking me? The question has been resolved." I remind you that 
that was on 25 January. Now, I will tell you that in his recent 
interview, Leonid Makarovych pointed out that, over one or one 
and one-half years he had been hearing demands at the Supreme 
Council that powers be divided among the president and the head 
of government. So, I did everything in order to have a single 
head of executive power. If there had been 300 votes in favor 
of making the prime minister head of executive power, something 
that I hoped would happen by 12 April, I wouldn't have cared 
about presidential elections at all. However, after 12 April, I 
became firmly convinced that this would not be approved by 300 
votes. That is why presidential elections will take place. 
Taking into account those contestants who were on the list, I 
believed that I also had reasons to be an alternative to them. 
  Asked whether he thought about a future state model, Ivan 
Plyushch pointed out that he considered the question 
inappropriate and referred the journalists to materials of the 
session of the 11th convocation that was held in February 1990; 
they are included in the book "Who Are We and Where Are We 
Going?" That far back, Ivan Plyushch was in favor of further 
democratization and glasnost in our life; he insisted upon 
putting an end to violation of objective economic laws, adopting 
state acts on land and on property, investing our sovereignty 
with real content, and building relations within a free union of 
states. 
  "We are not Germany, not France, not the United States, and 
not Canada. We are Ukraine with its own specific 
characteristics, mentality, people, and consciousness," 
continued Plyushch. "However, if we say that success lies in 
federalization, this will be incorrect as also incorrect is the 
statement that success lies in a unitary state. L. Kravchuk 
said that the Union was a federation, and look what it led to. 
I do not share his opinion, since had the Union been a 
federation, as was stipulated in the 1922 agreement, it would, 
perhaps, never disintegrate. In accordance with that agreement, 
Ukraine had the right to have its own armed forces, not to 
mention other things. However, are we, today, ready for a 
federation? We are not ready. The development of productive 
forces and the structure of production are such that they will 
not make it possible to have a federation in its classical form. 
However, this does not mean that we should never strive to 
achieve normal development of productive forces in regions or 
should not cultivate attitudes of masters and citizens among the 
population. All of our misfortunes are due to the fact that, 
instead of the Moscow center, we have created a Kiev one and 
that we are trying to copy everything. Why are we afraid of 
regional initiative or of delegating powers? It is necessary to 
grant such powers at a legislative level within oblasts with the 
help of which it would be possible to resolve an overwhelming 
majority of local problems and not to go to Kiev for that. I 
worked as head of an oblast executive committee for six years. 
At that time, the oblast annually transferred millions 
[monetary unit not specified] to the republican budget, and 
then, over a year, we received less than 10 percent of that 
money. It took me a lot of time to beg the authorities for 
those funds." 
  I. Plyushch expressed a conviction that [presidential] 
elections will be held: 
  "Four or five persons have been nominated as candidates for 
council chairmen at various levels. There are five persons for 
every deputy seat. That is why there is no logic in postponing 
the elections. Besides, presidential representatives are ready 
to run for council chairmen. Therefore, it is already 
impossible to disrupt elections, also presidential ones. I have 
proposed my candidacy, so that my conscience before Ukraine 
would be clear, since there are citizens who share my opinions, 
and I cannot betray them. I do not undertake to forecast the 
outcome of the elections. No matter whom I will have to contend, 
I will fight to the very end." 
  During the meeting, Ivan Plyushch also detailed his thoughts 
on other problems of the state -- economic, political, and 
ecological.

<H5>  Generation Potential </H5>
  Ukraine's electricity generation potential lies primarily in 
nuclear (NPP's) and fuel-fired (FFP's) powerplants with 
hydro-electric plants (HEP's) operational during peak 
consumption hours to preclude frequently drops below the 
critical 49.5 kHz mark. 
  The Ukrainian Ministry for power industry has 294 
enterprises 
under its command, including 42 power plants and 88 enterprises, 
which service power and heat transmission lines. Supply of 
electric power to consumers is effected via 615 regional 
networks including 493 networks in rural areas of Ukraine. 
  The total length of Ukraine's aerial and cable transmission 
lines amounts to 1,014,342 km including 951,604 km of aerial 
high-voltage transmission lines and 62,738 km of ground cable 
lines. Ukrainian power lines' maximal voltage is set at 800 kV. 
There are about 2,047,000 transformer substations in Ukraine 
with an aggregate power of 197,062 MVA. 


Power Generation 

(According to the Ministry of power industry)

Yrs     Total    Including 

                 FFP's    Percent    HEP's    Percent    NPP's    Percent 

1990    298.5    211.6    70.9       10.7     3.6        76.2     25.5 

1991    278.6    191.6    68.8       11.9     4.3        75.1     26.9 

1992    252.6    170.8    67.6       8.1      3.2        73.7     29.2 

1993    230.2    143.8    62.4       11.2     4.9        75.2     32.7 


  Ukraine's NPP's generated a total of 75.2 MWe including 27.5 
MWe by the Zaporozhye NPP, 11.8 MWe by the Rovno NPP, 5.8 MWe by 
the Khmelnitski NPP, 12.6 MWe by the Chernobyl NPP and 17.5 MWe 
by the South-Ukrainian NPP. 
  Ukraine's largest fuel-fired power plants are located in 
Zaporozhye, Uglegorsk, Krivoi Rog and Burshtynsk. 
  Electric power generation started shrinking back in 1991, 
accompanying Ukraine's total production slump. Reductions in 
power generation have been, since then, mirroring rather pro 
rata the dropping power consumption by industrial enterprises, 
forced to curtail production and thus economize on electricity 
in view of their products' too low competitiveness, due, among 
numerous other reasons, to excessive power consumption per unit 
of produce. 
  According to the Ministry of power industry, in 1993 Ukraine 
exported 2.7 MWe, though before 1990 it used to annually export 
as much as 30 MWe. As Vasiliy Protsenko, a deputy agency 
superintendent with the Ministry, maintains, the sharply reduced 
power export by Ukraine has been caused by the West's excessive 
power generation at much lower costs and prices. Thus, 
purchasing prices have dropped from 5.1 cents to 2.3 cents pr 
kW, while Ukrainian electric power generation costs average 2.55 
per kW. 
  The Ministry's forecast for 1994 is none too optimistic. 
Though the State Order prescribes to generate 134 billion kWh 
by Ukraine's fuel-fired power plants, not over 113.5 billion kWh 
will be actually generated by them. Similarly, Ukrainian HEP's 
will likely reduce their generation to the 9.46 MWe mark, and 70 
MWe is expected to be generated by the Ukrainian nukes. 
  In addition to Ukrainian industrial enterprises' shrinking 
consumption shortages of fuels will most certainly contribute to 
the predicted power generation drop. 
<H5>  Fuel's Break-Down in Electric Power Generation and Heat </H5>
Energy Production 
  Ukraine's fuel-fired power plants rely on coal, oil fuel and 
natural gas. Total power and fuel consumption amounted to 55.6 
million tons of conditional fuel, of which coal accounted for 
26.2 million tons (44 per cent), oil fuel's share was 6.5 
million tons (or 11 per cent), while natural gas and 
hydro-electric power accounted for respectively 23.1 (38.8 per 
cent) and 3.7 (6.2 per cent) million tons of conditional fuel. 
Physical amounts of fuels consumed by power plants were 42.9 
million tons of coal, 4.8 million tons of oil fuel, and 20.2 
billion cu. m. of natural gas. 
  According to Mr. Protsenko, in 1993 Ukraine imported 6 
million tons of coal, basically from Russia, though this year 
coal imports are expected to drop to 1 million tons, primarily 
due to shortages of Russian rubles. The forecast shortages of 
coal and oil fuel are estimated at 2.3 million tons and 2.9 
million tons, respectively. 
  Before 1990, the Ukrainian power industry's annual oil fuel 
requirements averaged 18 million tons. Presently, the figure is 
reduced to 3.8 million tons, since 50 per cent of power 
generating units are idle. 
  During the summer season's 30 per cent reduction in power 
consumption fuel-fired power plants rely on oil fuel and natural 
gas to save 800,000 to 1 million tons of coal for the 
fall-winter period. 
  Fuel shortages threaten with emergency situations, since the 
circuit's frequency drop below the critical threshold of 49.5 
kHz will result in the circuit's collapse. In view of this 
circumstance, the Ministry of power industry has to urgently cut 
off power supply to some consumers. In this way, about 3,000 
Ukrainian enterprises are daily cut off from power supply for 
brief periods. 
  Ukrainian NPP' consumed about 24 million tons of conditional 
fuel in 1992. 
<H5>  Power Industry's Financial Standing </H5>
  Presently, Ukraine's industrial enterprise-clients owe 9.5 
trillion krb. to the Ministry of power industry. The latter's 
indebtedness is estimated at 9.8 trillion krb. including 1.525 
trillion krb. for coal, 1.469 trillion krb. for oil fuel, and 
1.952 trillion krb. for natural gas. 
  According to Mr. Turos, the Ministry's agency 
superintendent, 
the government's credits, which were granted in late March to 
the Ministries of Industry and engineering, MIC and conversion 
to enable their enterprises to repay their indebtedness for 
fuels, were channeled elsewhere, so the debt to the Ministry of 
power industry was not repaid. As Ivan Magda, Deputy Minister 
for power industry, asserts, the Ministry is a virtual bankrupt, 
while its debtors repay only 50 per cent of their daily debts. 
  According to the Ministry's experts, the too low electric 
power tariff, which was set on January 1, 1994, is the major 
reason of the power industry's dire financial straits.

  [Text] NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has learned from sources close 
to Ukraine government circles that a new monetary unit -- the 
grivna -- is being introduced on all the territory of Ukraine as 
of 25 (or possibly 26) May to replace the Ukrainian 
karbovanets-coupons. It is assumed that the rate of exchange is 
100 karbovanets for one grivna. The dollar rate has shot up at 
Ukraine's exchange offices. Whereas one dollar could be bought 
for 47,000 karbovanets on 23 May, it cost more than 60,000 
karbovanets and between 66,000 and 70,000 in Kiev, Lvov, and 
Crimea on 24 May.

"`Democratic Russia' Wants to Be a Party Again. Mr. Yakunin 
and Mr. Ponomarev Still Have a Grudge Against Mr. Yeltsin and 
Mr. Gaydar"] 
  [Text] A meeting of the heads of regional branches of the 
"Democratic Russia" movement was held on 21 and 22 May. Taking 
part in it were 100 delegates representing 40 regional 
"Democratic Russia" organization. Leaders of the "Democratic 
Russia" regional branches who voiced the intention to join 
"Russia's Choice" were not invited to the meeting. 
  Those present held a discussion on the political situation 
in 
Russia and the situation in the democratic movement. They also 
discussed questions pertaining to forming, on the basis of the 
"Democratic Russia" movement, a party of the same name. After 
long debates, some 30 heads of regional branches thought it 
necessary to sign a manifesto, "Our Principles," thus 
automatically becoming members of the organizing committee of a 
Federal Party of "Democratic Russia" (FPDR). Its founding 
conference is not scheduled until this fall. 
  "Democratic Russia" leader Lev Ponomarev, who became 
chairman 
of the new party's organizing committee, thought it necessary to 
point out that the democratic movement is going through a 
crisis, while "the reforms have backfired, the president's will 
is absent, the president has become fenced off from democratic 
structures." In Mr. Ponomarev's opinion, the current problems 
experienced by the democratic movement have been caused by 
actions of the organizing committee of the emerging "Russia's 
Choice" party, in Lev Ponomarev's phrase, on the bones of the 
eponymous election bloc. 
  Gleb Yakunin, Mr. Ponomarev's colleague and long-standing 
comrade-in-arms, accused the "Russia's Choice" leaders of having 
dealt a formidable blow at Russia's democratic movement. At the 
same time Mr. Yakunin predicted a swift downfall for "Gaydar's 
party," pointing to the fact that regional branches are leaving 
"Russia's Choice" while many leaders of the parliamentary 
faction are displeased with Yegor Gaydar's actions and "are 
contemplating possibly leaving the bloc." 
  Besides, the cochairman of "Democratic Russia" leveled sharp 
criticism at President Yeltsin. "Shame on Boris Nikolayevich 
that he did not even give `Democratic Russia' any premises 
through these years, as neither did Sergey Filatov. This is the 
style of ingratitude," Mr. Yakunin complained. However, Mr. 
Ponomarev pointed out that he still continues to pin hopes on 
Boris Yeltsin alone. At the same time, yet another "Democratic 
Russia" chairman, Galina Starovoytova, who also spoke at the 
conference, thought it necessary to state: "With all respect 
for Boris Yeltsin, and despite his tremendous merits and a great 
historic contribution to the cause of the country's democratic 
development, is still politically on the way out."

<F P=106> [Article by military observer Vladimir Klimov: "Russian </F>
Arms Under Contract"] 
  [Text] Approve the attached Statute on the certification 
and registration of enterprises for the right to export weapons 
and military equipment and to perform work and services for 
military purposes. (From the Russian Federation Government 
Decree No. 479). 
  Our defense industry is on starvation rations. It has 
already become a habit to complain of the dwindling size of 
funds earmarked by the state. At a press conference Defense 
Minister Army General Pavel Grachev complained that the defense 
industry enterprises are not being allowed to earn money. If 
they were allowed to trade in their output many problems of the 
financing of the defense industry would be removed. 
  It is not long since the day when this wish was voiced but 
it 
looks as though the minister's dream is beginning to come true. 
The government decree, one of whose clauses is cited at the 
start of this article, has switched the trading light for the 
defense industry from red to green. 
  What rights are being offered to the enterprises which 
develop and produce weapons and military equipment and which 
have been certified and registered as participants in foreign 
economic activity in the field of miltary-technical cooperation? 
They can look for foreign clients, make presentations, and pass 
on during talks the tactical and technical specifications of 
arms authorized for export, give a guideline price, and perform 
advertising and other marketing operations. 
  But that is only the first authorized step. The second is 
the signing of contracts and, on the basis of the licenses 
received, the independent export of weapons and military 
equipment produced over and above the state defense order, and 
operations and services for military purposes. 
  But what if a defense enterprises does not yet have 
specialists capable of trading at international level? In that 
case it is permitted to choose middlemen among the organizations 
which have the right to conduct foreign economic activity in the 
field of military-technical cooperation. 
  The final point of a decree usually contains something of 
secondary importance. Probably the compilers of this decree did 
not regard as important the permission given to enterprises 
without drawing up a government decision to export spare parts 
and training and auxiliary materiel for weapons and military 
equipment already supplied abroad and also to perform work on 
their technical servicing and repair. But this point is 
extraordinarily important, since because of the absence of 
permission to carry out repairs and servicing and to sell 
training models, deals ready for signing were frequently 
thwarted. 
  This factor is also considered in the low percentage of 
sales 
of Russian weapons on the foreign market. Optimists believe 
that our share is something in the region of 11 percent, while 
pessimists believe it is 5 percent. Both figures are an 
indicator of our inability to trade. 
  What is of interest to the foreign customer right now? 
Primarily aircraft. There is a constant demand for the "Mig-29" 
and the "Su-27." 
  A lot has been written about the sale of combat aircraft. 
Just as much has been written about firearms. But in speaking 
of firearms we for some reason as a rule mention the Kalashnikov 
assault rifle. But we now produce completely new firearms -- 
underwater, noiseless, with a great killing power, for the 
special troops. These innovations are a tasty morsel for 
foreigners. High-class weapons -- and without exaggeration it 
may be said there is no other kind in Russia -- are essential in 
the struggle against terrorists and criminals. 
  The press mentions considerably less frequently the fact 
that 
the Russian "Igla" and "Strela" small air defense missile 
complexes are no less popular in the world than the U.S. 
"Stingers." The "Strela" was developed at the "Tochmash" design 
bureau and is intended for troops' air defense. Over 30 
countries have bought the "Strela" for their own armies. The 
latest model, the "Strela-10MZ," is a lightweight missile 
complex which is directly in the combat formations of the 
motorized rifle and tank regiments and can effectively protect 
them from aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles, and remotely 
piloted vehicles. 
  Even more flattering terms can be used to describe the 
S-300B 
mobile system of anti-aircraft guided missile weapons with two 
types of missiles. This supermodern air defense system was 
created at the "Antey" science and production association and 
despite its high cost is finding no shortage of customers. 
  And where are these countries which are prepared to respond 
to our offers of weapons? Russia's defense industry people have 
business relations with the states of the Near and Middle East, 
Southeast Asia, China, and India. The East European countries 
also remain purchasers of Russian weapons. 
  I wrote about the defense industry people's business 
relations and though I had made a mistake. After all, 
previously neither the "Tochmash" design bureau nor the "Antey" 
science and production association nor any other defense 
enterprises had anything. They had to make do with just the 
state order issued from above. And with the ruble, constantly 
dwindling because of inflation. But now the defense industry 
people will be able to obtain the "greenbacks" so prized in our 
country now. I want to believe that the dollars it earns will 
help the defense industry to survive under present conditions 
and to retain its powerful scientific potential and will enable 
it to pay people a normal wage. 
  But I want to tell those who, having heard about the 
dollars, 
are rushing to conclude the first deals, that the government 
decree supplements the "statute on the certification and 
registration of enterprises for the right to export weapons and 
military equipment and to perform work and services for military 
purposes." Each point of this statute should be studied 
thoroughly by a future participant in the trade in arms and 
combat equipment to avoid any misunderstandings which could 
result in a criminal case. 
  Meanwhile let us report that the certification and 
registration are being carried out to assess the possibility of 
enterprises' foreign economic activity, to protect Russia's 
state interests, and also to create conditions for coordinating 
and monitoring enterprises' activity in the field of 
military-technical cooperation. The Russian Federation 
interdepartmental commission for military-technical cooperation 
with foreign countries is carrying out the certification at the 
request of the Russian Federation state committee for the 
defense sectors of industry. 
  And so the defense industry's path into international trade 
is open. I want to believe that even the pessimists' percentage 
for our participation in a highly profitable business will 
exceed the optimists' present indicator. But although the green 
light has been given you must remember that the journey is 
always full of surprises. You must know how to prepare for them.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Why Does Russia Need 4 Million Men?"] </F>
  [Text] Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the 
Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, stated at a 
closed session of the State Duma Defense Committee that "a 
multiplication of power structures is now going on in Russia." 
In fact over 4 million people (2.3 million in the Armed Forces) 
have been put "under arms" in the country. 
  Besides the Army and Internal Troops, Mobile Troops are 
being 
formed. The Ministry for Emergency Situations is planning to 
form its own navy. Military formations are being recreated 
within the Federal Counterintelligence Service system and in the 
Federal Government Communications Service. The president's 
Security Service is being expanded. 
  Kolesnikov said that Russia "is not in a position to 
maintain 
four armies." He stated that the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry is ready, "should the government so decide," to 
transfer the Russian Federation Navy and part of the Airborne 
Forces to the Border Guard Troops' command in order to form 
mobile forces." According to Kolesnikov, because of insufficient 
resources, this is the fourth year that mobilization assemblies 
have not been carried out and all large-scale exercises have 
been scrapped (all that is left is command and staff map 
exercises). 
  Given normal financing, Kolesnikov said, we would be able to 
reduce the Army to 1.5 million men as early as this year.

<F P=106> [`SEGODNYA'-INTERFAX report under the "Money" rubric: </F>
"Council of Ministers Ponders Freezing of Ruble Rate While 
Central Bank of Russia Ponders Letting Western Banks Into the 
Country"] 
  [Text] The government of Russia is not working now to 
further sharply reduce inflation, which is already running as 
low as 8-9 percent a month; instead it intends primarily to 
ensure "stability" of the money market, Sergey Vasilyev, 
Russian Federation deputy minister of the economy, stated at 
the "New Aspects of Reforming Russia's Economy" congress which 
opened in Moscow on Tuesday. 
  The gradual forming of a fixed ruble rate (instead of the 
current floating one) could, to Sergey Vasilyev's mind, become 
one of the mechanisms to fight, among other things, the 
"dollarization" of the economy. It is this, Mr. Vasilyev 
stated, that makes it possible to strengthen Russia's national 
currency. Remarkably, the deputy minister of the economy 
pointed out, the formation of positive bank rates provides for 
the growth of ruble accumulations in the country right now. 
  In the meantime, Russian Central Bank Deputy Chairman 
Aleksandr Khandruyev stated yesterday that Russia could give 
foreign banks, as early as the beginning of this summer, a 
broader access to the country. Mr. Khandruyev thinks the 
country's banks are already strong enough to offer serious 
competition to Western banks. At the same time Mr. Khandruyev 
ventured a guess that foreign banks would respond "without any 
particular enthusiasm" to the decision to give them broader 
access to Russia. 
  It is also worthwhile mentioning in this connection that 
Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin signed an edict back 
on 13 November 1993 that limited "temporarily, for the period 
till 1 January 1996," activities of foreign banks on the 
territory of Russia to servicing non-residents alone. However, 
even before the signing of this presidential edict, Russian 
Federation Central Bank licenses for banking operations were 
received, among others, by the Credit Lyonnais, the Bank of 
Australia, the Societe Generale-Vostok, the Bank of China, the 
BNP-Dresdner Bank, the Credit Suisse, CitiBank, and the Chase 
Manhattan Bank, which have in the meantime familiarized 
themselves sufficiently with the none-too-simple realities of a 
peculiar Russian market.

<F P=106> [Report by Galina Shkurenko] </F>
  [Text] Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy chairman of the Russian 
Federation Government, held a news conference today regarding 
the package of presidential decrees relating to economic issues. 
They were published in today's newspaper. [Shkurenko] The 
vice prime minister told representatives of the press how these 
decrees were drawn. A week ago during a six-hour long 
conversation between the president and the head of the cabinet 
of ministers measures for stabilizing the economy and continuing 
reforms were examined. Then the government drew up a package of 
documents, which were discussed during Boris Yeltsin's meeting 
with managers and Viktor Chernomyrdin's meeting with 
representatives of enterprises, banking, and economic structures 
who were participating in the signing of the Public Accord 
Treaty. 
  At the present time draft decrees are being drawn up 
relating 
to regulation of the consumption fund, improving banking 
activity, on some issues regarding the regulation of the 
securities' market, protecting of consumers from dishonest 
advertising and on the sale of enterprises that are in debt. 
Regarding the latter it will probably be signed literally today 
or tomorrow. 
  Regarding the decrees that have already been signed by the 
President, Shokhin said the following: 
  [Shokhin] I would like to draw your attention to the fact 
that in this package of documents there are many openly liberal 
premises connected with reducing taxes. We were pursuing two 
aims simultaneously: to ease the tax burden while at the same 
time enforcing tax discipline more strictly. No one can dispute 
that this is a normal demand. As the enterprises begin to get 
out of this situation, if they want to obey the law, bearing in 
mind that the general policy of the government has been defined 
here as that of reducing taxes, either they want to test how 
firm the strict measures that are indicated in the decrees are, 
and the future will show, and the experience of many countries 
shows, that in conditions of sufficiently lenient taxes, they 
pay much better than they evade tax, and we will gradually move 
toward that. If enterprises will have many accounts and are 
failing to provide information that they are not registering 
their accounts at least, there can be no question of help for 
those enterprises from the budget, of centralized investments. 
  The problem of abolishing quotas is in actual fact the 
problem of stabilizing our export-orientated production 
facilities. That mechanism allows us to stabilize the situation 
in the oil and gas complex, metallurgy, cellulose, and paper 
production. Many clauses in the decrees that came out yesterday 
were already registered back in March, in particular. They were 
even submitted to the State Duma. 
  On the other hand, a certain critical mass is needed not 
only 
in the number of decrees, but also in the number of clauses 
contained in them to impart additional impulses to the reforms. 
The critical mass, it seems, is present in that package of 
decrees.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Berger article: "Chernomyrdin Government Has </F>
Prepared Small Economic Revolution"] 
  [Text] The Russian Government has prepared a package of 
documents (eight presidential edicts and one government decree), 
the signing of which could accomplish a small-scale revolution 
in the country's economy. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin's government has probably decided to 
answer in one go the charges which have been repeatedly leveled 
against it throughout the 18 months of its existence. 
  The package of prepared edicts holds out the promise of a 
great revival in economic life, which some people have been 
patiently awaiting while others have been hitherto hoping to 
avoid. 
  Some of the drafts are relatively uncontroversial in nature, 
developing already known topics: a package of measures 
introducing taxes into the budget, measures to normalize 
settlements and tighten up payment discipline, and certain 
questions of tax policy. But the package also contains 
documents which are bound to produce certain upheavals. These 
include draft edicts "On the Sale of Debtor-Enterprises," "On 
the Reform of State Enterprises," and "On the Abolition of the 
Issuing of Quotas and Licenses for Supplies of Goods and 
Services for Export. 
  One of the edicts will enable a sigh of relief to be 
breathed 
by those frightened by the Labor Ministry's promises to limit 
wages in drastic fashion. The Labor Ministry was indulging in 
wishful thinking when it issued via news agencies last week its 
own version of measures to limit incomes. It in no way follows 
from the draft edict "On the Regulation of Resources Used for 
Consumption" that a wage in excess of 240,000 rubles [R] per 
month will be liable to draconian taxation, as the Labor 
Ministry proposes. And the idea that earnings of 
R400,000-700,000 per month are "out of this world" will remain 
the labor minister's personal opinion. 
  There was virtually only one restriction in the draft edict 
on this topic as it existed at the end of Sunday: An increase 
in the wages fund which exceeds the level of the growth in 
prices by more than 70 percent will be liable to a fine. 
  The edict "On Certain Questions of Taxation Policy" will 
prove even more agreeable to many people. Under this edict the 
government is required to make proposals on improving the tax 
system by 15 September. The areas of improvement are as 
follows: reducing the total number of taxes and reducing the 
level of profit tax and value-added tax [VAT] by 10-20 percent. 
  Foreign investors -- provided, of course, they are bona fide 
investors -- can obtain substantial concessions. Joint ventures 
registered since 1 January this year which have a foreign 
capital stake of at least 30 percent and investments of at least 
$10 million are exempt from all payment of profit tax into the 
federal budget for three years. During the fourth year of their 
existence they will pay one-quarter of the tax due, and in their 
fifth year one-half. But if a joint venture is wound up before 
it has been in existence six years it will have to repay all the 
concessions received to the federal budget. 
  By all accounts, the government intends to follow the route 
of drastically tightening up control over tax receipts rather 
than increasing tax rates. The draft of the relevant edict 
envisages the mandatory registration of all kinds of accounts 
(hard currency, deposit, loan accounts, and so forth) with the 
tax bodies. If, however, a bank does open an account for an 
enterprise without a certificate from the tax inspectorate, the 
bank chief will be fined 100 times the minimum wage. 
  If an enterprise goes three months without paying taxes a 
decision may be made to deem it insolvent. 
  And another pretty tough measure, affecting individuals this 
time too, is that banks must inform the tax bodies of all 
transactions exceeding $10,000. 
  But it is the edicts on the reform of state enterprises and 
the sale of enterprises in debt which could have the most 
serious consequences. The idea of the reform is to eliminate in 
practice such a socialist vestige as the "right of full economic 
authority." This right has allowed the directors of state 
enterprises to be in complete charge of state property while 
being in no way accountable. 
  The edict on the sale of debtor-enterprises confirms the 
statute on this procedure. The Federal Administration for 
Insolvency Affairs, the debtor-enterprise itself or its 
creditors, the prosecutor's office or the State Committee for 
the Management of State Property can act as the initiator of 
this procedure. Liability for bogus bankruptcy is laid down. 
Sales are effected purely on the basis of commercial bids 
without restriction on the makeup of the parties involved 
(including individuals and foreign buyers). 
  The package of documents also contains a statute on the 
criteria governing the provision of state financial assistance, 
which is constantly being demanded from the exchequer by many 
directors. The criteria and the terms for the provision of 
assistance are plain and clear. If events develop in a certain 
way, the question of declaring an enterprise bankrupt may be 
raised. 
  The issue of these edicts has so agitated the public that 
Aleksandr Livshits, leader of the president's group of experts, 
held a press conference on Monday, 23 May. He explained the 
reason for President Yeltsin's slip of the tongue when he 
described the economy as being "on the verge of collapse." 
Livshits observed that the economy is not suffering from any 
catastrophe -- there is a problem of falling output. He also 
spoke about the package of edicts discussed in our article. 
  All the edicts come into force from the moment they are 
signed and will operate until the Duma passes the relevant laws.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Viktor Chernomyrdin: `Russia Has </F>
Its Own Way of Entering the Market.' Extract From Russian 
Premier's Speech at 20 May Meeting With Leaders of Industrial, 
Construction, and Transport Enterprises and Organizations"] 
  [Text] Today the root of all problems is the lack of 
specific mechanisms for economic regulation designed to 
stimulate vital market forces, create a competitive environment, 
overcome the sales crisis, and solve payment defaults. Marking 
time is akin to death now. We must make far more rapid progress 
to develop and fine-tune the necessary regulators in order to 
keep even what we have already achieved. That is the 
government's main cause for concern and anguish in the 
foreseeable future. 
  In this connection we have prepared a whole series of draft 
statutory documents -- in the form of presidential edicts and 
government decrees -- designed to bolster the priorities of the 
policy of accord that have been discussed today. They all stem 
directly from the president's instructions on tackling the 
urgent problems of economic reform. 
  To be brief, the purpose and substance of these instructions 
boils down to a single formula: Transformations of the Russian 
economy should be geared to the national manufacturer of goods 
and services, his interests must be protected, and his 
initiative given free rein. 
  The first set of measures that have been outlined concern 
the 
prompt and full payment into the budget of taxes and other 
mandatory payments, strengthening payment discipline in the 
national economy, and stepping up tax policy. 
  What am I talking about? Primarily that taxpayers' liability 
for observance of tax legislation is enhanced. 
  It is envisaged that they will provide tax organs without 
fail with regular information about their bank accounts and 
banks will report on enterprises opening accounts. This is to 
ensure fuller monitoring of enterprises' financial position and 
stop a number of widespread means of tax evasion. 
  A procedure will be established governing the mandatory use 
of enterprise funds in deposit and hard-currency accounts to 
meet commitments to budgets and other creditors and to pay 
wages. This will make it possible to considerably reduce the 
amount of payment defaults and speed up payment even if 
enterprises do not have money in their main accounts. 
  What is more, in order to ease tension in funding 
enterprises' priority needs, including wages, during a temporary 
shortage of cash, they will be granted the right to obtain funds 
from banks amounting to no more than 5 percent of average daily 
receipts in their settlement accounts. 
  In order to attract foreign investments it is intended to 
exempt enterprises with sizeable foreign investments from the 
payment of profit tax into the federal budget for three years. 
And over the subsequent two years the tax will be levied at a 
reduced rate. 
  We are also proposing to even out the terms of value added 
taxation [VAT] on Russian and imported goods and impose tough 
restrictions on the range of goods liable to VAT at a reduced 
rate. 
  The question of surmounting sizeable wage differentials that 
are not justified by real labor input and results is extremely 
topical and it is no exaggeration to say that it concerns 
everyone today. This problem has become highly social and 
sometimes takes on a political slant. I must say that the 
government is planning to submit draft legislative acts 
authorizing restrictions on the growth of funds used for 
consumption in respect of enterprises with high wage levels 
allowing for the rate of inflation. 
  I want to stress that the prohibitive measures will by no 
means apply to all enterprises. Those which are increasing 
production will receive definite concessions. 
  The Statute on the Procedure for the Sale of Debtor 
Enterprises that has been drafted considerably furthers the 
reform of state enterprises. This statute extends to all 
insolvent enterprises in state and municipal ownership. 
  I recently signed a government decree "On Certain Measures 
To 
Implement the Legislation on Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of 
Enterprises." It introduces criteria for deciding insolvency. 
The Federal Administration for Bankruptcy Cases is obliged 
prior to 1 July 1994 to begin producing a list of insolvent 
enterprises. 
  Now let me say a few words about what will be done in the 
foreign economic sphere. We are planning to considerably reduce 
export customs duties on goods that hold a leading place in the 
structure of Russian exports -- oil and petroleum products, gas, 
electricity, aluminum, pulp -- and to abolish export quotas and 
licenses. 
  No program, no matter how good, will work on its own. We 
have taken strict control of fulfilling the action plan to 
implement the first phase of the Government Program and the main 
provisions of the president's message to the Federal Assembly. 
  For all the malfunctions and mistakes, for all the attempts 
to hamper things, two years of reform have not been wasted. 
Russia can already be said to have its own way of entering the 
market and its own Russian model for development.

  [Text] The removal of export quotas and licences so as to 
help readjust prices and duties on crude oil and oil products is 
to the benefit of oil producers, President of the Rosneft state 
company Aleksandr Putilov told INTERFAX. 
  He said Yeltsin's decree was prepared along with a 
government 
resolution to halve export duties from 30 to 15 ecus (or 5 to 
2.5 dollars per barrel) per one tonne of crude. Duties on oil 
products must also be halved, Putilov said. 
  "If implemented, the resolution will help producers secure a 
more acceptable level of export prices and increase their 
foreign exchange revenues," he stressed. 
  Oil and gas experts say that the producers are keen to 
increase their share of oil exports to countries other than the 
republics of the former Soviet Union. Russia sells crude oil to 
other CIS states at a price of 65-70 dollars a tonne compared 
with the world's price of 110 dollars. 
  Rosneft experts believe that some of the losses that the 
producers will have to sustain from taxes on the exports of 25 
million tonnes of crude on government orders can be offset by 
benefits arising from fixed duties and higher exports to the 
West.

<F P=106> [Report by Yelena Yakovleva: "Harvest Prospects Worse Than </F>
Last Year"] 
  [Text] The most accurate "predictor" of last year's 
harvest, the "SovEkon" center, does not promise cheerful 
prospects this year. According to its figures Russia will 
harvest 80-85 million tonnes of grain. 
  For comparison's sake last year the country obtained 99 
million tonnes of grain and the year before 107 million. 
  On what does "SovEkon" base its forecast? The area sown to 
winter crops has declined by 20 percent and about 2 million 
hectares (about 15 percent) of the winter crops that were sown 
have died. The sowing campaign began quite well but now the 
pace has been reduced, as is borne out by the weekly 
information. And if the sowing schedule is extended the 
harvesting schedule will also be pushed back. 
  "SovEkon" also keeps track of information about fuel and 
fertilizer stocks. As of 1 May stocks of fuel on the farms were 
40 percent less than last year and half as much fertilizer and 
toxic chemicals were applied: The soil continues to be depleted. 
  It is true, as our correspondent Andrey Aderekhin has 
reported, that the Kuban grain fields this year will not be 
reduced. In the traditional grain regions they are working on 
the sowing responsibly and seriously and if necessary going out 
on night shifts, although it is a long time since anyone 
monitored anybody. The Kuban private farmers have prepared seeds 
and equipment in advance. And already the most acute question 
is not "how to sow and how to harvest?" but "how to sell most 
advantageously?" 
  Almost everyone is planning a lower yield. But many grain 
stocks remain in the country from last year's harvest -- 
approximately 18 million tonnes. Every month about 2.8 million 
tonnes are spent. We are thus provided with "old" grain on 
average for six months and for some types through to the next 
sowing campaign. 
  Apart from the Far East and Siberian regions, to which it is 
cheaper to deliver imported grain than our own because of the 
huge distance it has to travel, Russia will nonetheless manage 
with its own grain this year -- that is the stance of Vice Prime 
Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha and Agriculture Minister Viktor 
Khlystun. In principle these calculations are convincing, but 
ultimately it will all depend on the structure of our stocks: 
Those 18 million tonnes of grain could contain, for instance, 
an insufficient quantity of food grain or corn.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Abarinov under the "Details" rubric: </F>
"Export of Peacekeepers Does Not Earn Profit. General 
Podkolzin Relies on False Information"] 
  [Text] When SEGODNYA published in its 19 May issue a 
statement by General Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne 
Troops, that Russian peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia have 
helped slash Russia's debt to the United Nations from $1.5 
billion to $200 million, it expressed its doubt as to whether 
the information was relliable. Now we have full justification 
for calling it false. 
  According to our information, Russia's debt to the UN Fund 
of 
Peacekeeping Operations stands at around $550 million. In the 
past two years (the period to which Yevgeniy Podkolzin 
referred), not only has the debt failed to shrink, but it has 
even grown. Payments due to Russian servicemen for 
participation in UN operations do not count toward debt payment. 
The Russian paratroopers receive from the UN fund just as much 
as servicemen of other countries -- around $1,000 per person per 
month. The rest is paid by the countries that have sent their 
contingents. Alas, the Russian Government does not pay any 
extra money -- hence a significant gap in wages. 
  Therefore, the "export" of peacekeepers does not bring 
Russia 
any earnings. Nor does it have any bearing on the Russian 
contribution to the UN Peacekeeping Fund -- this is another sum 
of money and another debt.

  [Text] Moscow, 24 May -- Russian President Yeltsin has 
signed a decree "on the military uniform and badges of military 
rank." 
  With this document, in accordance with Article 38 of the 
Russian Federation law "On Military Duty and Military Service," 
Yeltsin has confirmed the uniform and badges of rank of 
servicemen of the armed forces of the Russian Federation and 
other troops, organs of external intelligence, 
counterintelligence, the chief directorate for protection and 
the security service of the president. 
  ITAR-TASS has been told by the president's press service 
that 
the Russian Government has also been instructed to confirm 
within three months regulations governing the provision of 
soldier's supplies and standard quantities for the supply of 
items. 
  Yeltsin decreed that the corresponding decrees of the 
Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet, concerning servicemen's 
badges of rank, be considered inoperative.

  [Text] Belarusian Deputy Foreign Minister Petr Belyayev 
announced that his republic's possible participation in NATO's 
Partnership for Peace [PFP] program would not be analyzed before 
presidential elections and the autumn parliamentary session. 
  In his opinion, politically, Belarus was ready to join this 
project, and had informed the NATO leadership. 
  In an interview with INTERFAX, Belyayev said that the search 
for his republic's possible participation in NATO's program was 
very difficult, because Belarus had not yet reorganized its 
armed forces due to the deteriorating economic situation. 
  Belarus must not hasten to join the Partnership for Peace 
program, because it was faced with many problems in conventional 
and strategic disarmament.

<F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Yekaterina Vysotskaya for </F>
TASS] 
  [Text] Minsk 24 May TASS -- As of today the Republic of 
Belarus has to pay six trillion Belarusian roubles to Russia for 
fuel resources it has already used. But energy consumers alone 
owe one trillion 200 billion, and 4.2 trillion hang in mid-air. 
  Commenting on the situation, National Bank of Belarus Board 
of Directors Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich said: "We bought it 
cheap, sold cheap, and are living well. All this for the sake 
of supporting industry, in order to reduce the cost of 
production. But this has led us into a blind alley, because if 
the consumption of power is not cut down, and one has to pay, 
then after all it must be recovered from someone." 
  The chief treasurer of the republic noted that an idea is 
already wandering, according to which the national bank will 
have to "create out of air" 4 trillion and pay up. "But the way 
this question is formulated is devoid of common sense," he 
emphasised.

  [Text] A group of people's deputies from the Belarusian 
Social Democratic Assembly faction in the Supreme Soviet has 
addressed Matthew Kahane, UN permanent representative to the 
Republic of Belarus, with a letter regarding the violation of 
the Belarusian Constitution by Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich. 
In particular, the letter broaches the agreement on monetary 
merger between Belarus and Russia, which was signed by the prime 
minister. "Mr. Kebich, resting upon those forces in the Supreme 
Soviet, which allow themselves to grossly violate the state 
constitutional system, attempts to incorporate Belarus into the 
Russian Federation by an unconstitutional means," the letter 
reads. "We are also astonished by the position of the Russian 
Government, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, which 
signed the agreement contradicting the Belarusian Constitution." 
The authors of the letter express their assurance that the 
international community is not interested in destabilizing the 
situation and maintaining Russian nuclear weapons in the center 
of Europe; therefore, the United Nations will give a legal 
evaluation of the above mentioned agreement as well as the 
resolution on the holding of presidential elections in May-June 
1994.

  [Text] Beginning 1 June and prior to the actual 
unification of monetary systems of Belarus and Russia, all 
settlements on the territory of Belarus will be implemented in 
Belarusian rubles. A resolution of the Board of the Belarusian 
National Bank on this issue indicates that such a step is 
prompted by the length of the interim period in the unification 
of monetary systems of both states. An official exchange rate 
will be introduced for the Russian ruble, by which Belarusian 
banks and other economic entities should be guided.

Calls for Unification of Democratic Forces During Election 
Campaign"] 
  [Text] The Belarusian Popular Front [BNF] has held a news 
conference, during, which a statement by the BNF Secretariat was 
publicized. The statement, in particular, notes that Zyanon 
Paznyak, a presidential candidate put forward by the BNF, 
collected the largest number of supporting signatures among 
those candidates who did not utilize the state apparatus in 
collecting them. In the opinion of BNF leaders, this testifies 
to the fact that Zyanon Paznyak is the most realistic contender 
for the presidential post among democratically oriented 
candidates. 
  The BNF calls for the unification of democratic forces 
during 
the election campaign, the organizers of the news conference 
agreed. However, they expressed an apprehension that a likely 
dispersion of votes among candidates of democratic orientation 
can lead to the victory of pro-Communist forces. "Therefore, we 
appeal to all those candidates who regard themselves as 
democrats and to their supporting teams to consider a possible 
withdrawal of their candidacies on behalf of the most realistic 
contender," the statement notes. According to the BNF 
leadership, such a step can encourage unity and the future 
victory of Belarusian democratic forces.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mukhammat Sabirov, prime minister of </F>
Tatarstan, by Zhanna Khidiatullina; date, place not given: "We 
Must Find Our Own Path"] 
  [Text] At their 19th session the deputies of the Tatarstan 
Supreme Soviet approved the republic budget on condition that a 
program to get the economy out of crisis is presented for their 
consideration before 30 May. A TATAR-INFORM correspondent asked 
Tatarstan Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov to say what the 
government is doing in this brief period to prepare for an 
extraordinary Supreme Soviet session to discuss the document 
that will determine the future course of the republic's economic 
development. 
  [Khidiatullina] The Republic of Tatarstan Cabinet of 
Ministers is working on an anticrisis program. Is the economic 
situation that dire? 
  [Sabirov] We have probably not chosen the most felicitous 
terms. I would not say that our economy is in a stage of 
crisis. Of course, many enterprises are close to it, but a 
number of sectors are developing perfectly well. Although the 
situation has been getting increasingly serious month by month 
since the beginning of 1994. 
  It must not be forgotten that the integration of the 
Tatarstan economy in the Russian economy is so great that we are 
bound to be affected by all its fluctuations. We only have the 
power to influence the acuteness of the problem of defaulting on 
payment and the speed at which it develops. I am referring 
above all to the situation that has developed over reciprocal 
default. Since last year Republic of Tatarstan President M. 
Shaymiyev and members of the Tatarstan Cabinet of Ministers have 
been trying to persuade the Russian leadership to opt for 
reciprocal settlement. 
  No way would you call it a market measure, of course. But 
Moscow could not come up with any other solution either. And in 
the meantime everyone has fallen into debt. Even those who were 
producng continuously and selling products. The "Tatneft" 
association was forced to dismiss people or send them on 
administrative leave, because it had no money to pay them. This 
enormous enterprise is unable to get the 400 billion rubles [R] 
it has earned. Reciprocal debt between enterprises in Tatarstan 
and Russia now totals approximately R2 trillion. 
  Many people are asking banks for credit. You are well aware 
of the interest rates -- 21 percent and more. They double if 
payment dates are not met. Naturally, enterprises include these 
payments in the cost price -- a familiar chain of events! Some 
organizations and small plants are now being refused credit (the 
banks also fear for their money) and they, having spent their 
circulating capital, are beginning to "eat into" their fixed 
capital. 
  We are able to support only the firms that are producing 
products essential to the republic. We will do this 
irrespective of the form of ownership of the enterprise. Some 
of them will be declared bankrupt. What can you do? Tatarstan 
cannot solve this problem alone, of course. Particularly where 
plants of the former military-industrial complex are concerned. 
It is great, of course, that we are now producing practically 
no weapons at all, but the vast machine tools that used to 
produce aircraft wings or warship hulls are not ready to produce 
irons or washing machines. 
  But we can do something. The construction of a tanker 
fleet will provide long-term orders for the plant named for 
Gorkiy in Zelenodolsk, helicopters made by our specialist 
company are still in demand, and the Kazan Aircraft Plant has 
called to say that a Russian Federation government decree had 
placed orders for the new Tu-330 cargo aircraft, which can carry 
20-30 tonnes. 
  But enterprises such as the Lenin Science and Production 
Association, try as they may to keep their heads above water by 
producing linoleum or artificial leather, cannot resolve the 
problems of conversion. Russia needs to start meetings its 
commitments as set out in the treaty and the intergovernmental 
agreements. But, despite all our efforts, we have not yet been 
able to secure the necessary measures. 
  [Khidiatullina] So Tatarstan needs a practical program to 
solve its problems? 
  [Sabirov] Absolutely. But everything must be done to gear 
this program to the future. Only a madman would dream of a 
return to the past. We have not seriously attempted to consider 
what the economic system in our country is going to look like. 
Although for a year now the Cabinet of Ministers has been 
working on "Basic Guidelines for the Economic and Social 
Development of the Republic of Tatarstan in Accordance With the 
new Republic of Tatarstan Constitution." Academics and 
practical experts have been involved in this work. The draft is 
now ready. It is being examined by foreign experts. Together 
with the Republic of Tatarstan Constitution, the treaty between 
Russia and Tatarstan, and the government program it will form 
the basis of the program currently being devised to stabilize 
the Republic of Tatarstan economy. The main aim is to ensure 
that any turn of events has as little effect as possible on our 
people. 
  We are considering the economic situation in many countries 
and are copying the positive experience of Germany, Hungary, and 
Turkey. But none of these states has specific solutions to 
offer. For example, Turkish private enterprises are doing a fine 
job and their products are competitive. But we cannot help 
being worried by the rate of inflation and the appearance of 
large numbers of impoverished people there. That is not for us. 
We must plow our own furrow. 
  [Khidiatullina] How is work on the document that is to be 
submitted for discussion by the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet 
deputies proceeding in practice? 
  [Sabirov] All ministries and departments are now engaged in 
elaborating their own proposals. Every five days the members of 
the government meet to discuss progress in implementing this 
important task. We were prepared to examine several alternative 
versions. When we began to listen to the ministers' and vice 
premiers' proposals we realized that there was no sharp 
disagreement. Basically, everyone recognized an identical 
objective. Differences arose when the tactics for attaining it 
were discussed. 
  The program will include a number of practical measures. 
Moreover, we are working on a mechanism for implementing it -- 
normative acts, draft laws, draft edicts. Adopting another 
declaration would be a waste of time. It is conceivable that 
the Supreme Soviet could grant the president special powers for 
the period of the document's implementation, whereby his edicts 
would have the force of law. Without this, rapid decisions and 
vigorous measures are impossible. 
  [Khidiatullina] Will you be able to complete all the work by 
30 May? 
  [Sabirov] Had the Cabinet of Ministers not been working on 
the problem for, I repeat, nearly a year, it would have been 
impossible to do so in such a hurry, in a matter of days. But I 
am confident now that on 30 May the deputies will start 
discussing the program for the stabilization of the Tatarstan 
economy.

  [Text] In spite of what the skeptics said, Chechen 
President Dzhokhar Dudayev has nevertheless succeeded in 
creating his own armed forces. This was clearly shown by the 
latest military parade in Groznyy, where military units were 
presented with banners and demonstrated their own uniforms. Two 
years ago when the rebellious general announced universal 
mobilization, many people, including people in Chechnya itself, 
viewed it as a children's game, forgetting that the Chechen 
president had excellent military training. Today Dudayev, apart 
from his National Guard, has several regiments, including an air 
squadron. 
  Chechen cadre officers who have returned to the republic 
after being demobilized from Russian and CIS Armed Forces are 
being utilized in the Army. Despite the critical lack of cash 
in Chechnya and the lack of its' own currency, Dudayev 
nevertheless does not begrudge money for the Army or its 
weaponry. As the president himself said at a recent news 
conference, the world is too cruel and recognizes only strength. 
To all appearances he shares the dream of creating a strong 
Chechen state with its' own army. In one way or another the 
existence of the Chechen Armed Forces is already a fact. This 
fact will almost certainly be used by Dudayev at the possible 
coming talks with Russia. [video shows military parade in

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Valeriy Korobeynikov, academician of </F>
the International Academy of Computerization: "Don't Take 
Offense at the Voter. He Is Always Right"] 
  [Text] How difficult is Russia finding it to become a 
democratic state! This is what comes to mind when analyzing the 
results of the elections to the local representative organs of 
power. Failure by the bulk of citizens to appear at the polling 
places, fairly frequent violations of electoral rights, and 
flaws in the mechanisms for collaboration between the various 
participants in the electoral process -- all this was not the 
exception but the rule. 
  It is expedient to explore two routes simultaneously in the 
quest for solutions to the problems which have arisen -- 
elaborating an integrated concept of the Russian electoral 
system and analyzing constructively the practical experience 
gained so far. 
  Unfortunately, the new Russian Constitution does not contain 
a chapter on the electoral system which is traditionally in a 
country's Fundamental Law. Constitutional norms concerning 
elections are scattered among other chapters. This weakness is 
to some extent compensated for by the presidential edict "On 
Measures To Improve the Electoral System in the Russian 
Federation." But even this document needs to be further 
developed. A number of laws need to be elaborated and adopted, 
such as a law on electing the president and deputies to the 
State Duma, a law on referendums, and so on. 
  In order to improve the electoral system in Russia, it is 
important to thoroughly consider both the negative and the 
positive aspects of its practice. Quite a bit has already been 
written about the negative aspects. I would like to concentrate 
on the positive. 
  Let us take Stavropol Kray as an example. The results of the 
voting speak for themselves. Some 39.76 percent of the voters 
voted for candidates for deputies to the Stavropol Kray State 
Duma in all the 25 electoral districts. The region's new 
legislative organ was formed at the first attempt. 
  It cannot be said that the election campaign in Stavropol 
Kray went off without any conflicts. On the contrary, there 
were, for example, some tense moments over the kray duma's 
numerical composition, the electoral districts' boundaries, and 
the statute on the elections. In short, the degree of conflict 
was fairly high. The voters' attitude during the run-up to the 
elections was also typical of many of the country's regions. 
Interest in the elections was lower than average. But 
nevertheless, the negative aspects did not influence the final 
result. Why? 
  This can, in my view, be attributed first and foremost to 
the 
flexible and active stance of the local executive branch of 
power. The organizational measures for preparing and conducting 
the elections were distinguished by their lack of orthodoxy. 
  Representatives of the executive organs of power also made a 
contribution to boosting the voters' activeness. On the eve of 
the elections, STAVROPOLSKAYA PRAVDA published an appeal by Kray 
Administration Head Yevgeniy Kuznetsov to the voters. Calling 
on citizens to come to the polling places, the administration 
head appealed not only to their civic consciences but also to 
their sense of thrift. After all, many millions of rubles had 
been spent on organizing the elections in the kray, as, 
incidentally, has been the case in other regions. The people 
should know how to dispose of their property prudently. 
  Last but not least. Let us recall the days of voting in 
pre-perestroyka times. For all their fundamental faults (lack 
of choice, mandatory participation, and so on), their form was 
attractive. 
  There is nothing to be ashamed about here. What is more, the 
Russian electoral system will become genuinely democratic 
precisely at the moment when elections become a responsible 
demonstration of civic-mindedness, a real festival of people's 
power.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Maltsev report in the "Another Fire at Pacific </F>
Fleet Depots" column: "This Time Cannon Grease Set Alight"] 
  [Text] On Monday at approximately midday Moscow time 
another fire broke out at Pacific Fleet depots in Vladivostok. 
This is the third serious fire at the Black Sea Fleet in the 
past year and the second in the last 10 days. This time the 
fire occurred at a fuel and lubricant depot located in the city 
center near the city's oil tanks. It was only thanks to prompt 
action by firemen that the fire did not spread to the oil tanks. 
The scale of the damage and causes of the fire are being 
established. 
  As firemen told KOMMERSANT-DAILY, a report about a fire at a 
military depot located 150 meters from the city's oil tanks came 
in at the central control point of the Vladivostok Fire Security 
Department. According to the firemen, non-disposable fuel and 
lubricants were stored at the depot: cannon grease, machine oil, 
and other types. Ivan Kopot, deputy chief of the Fire Safety 
Department, said that the Vladivostok oil tanks are a 
transshipment point for fuel deliveries to the entire Maritime 
Kray and are also used for filling vessels, including oil 
tankers. 
  The fire was rated at three on the scale of difficulty (out 
of five). Ten fire engines and a fire train were sent to the 
area. The work was complicated by the fact that water in the 
hydrants on the storage premises was so polluted that the fire 
engine hoses were repeatedly blocked. However within an hour 
the seat of the fire was localized and soon it was extinguished 
completely. 
  It is noteworthy that the two previous large fires at the 
Pacific Fleet depots cost fleet commanders Gennadiy Khvatov and 
Georgiy Gurinov their posts.

<F P=106> [By Yan Berling in Severomorsk; from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The first trainload of the nuclear fuel waste has 
left the Sogagorka railway junction in Arkhangelsk at 0200 
today. For almost three years now the nuclear reactor rods have 
been deposited at the SevMash [Severodvinsk Machine-building] 
enterprise in Severodvinsk at which redundant nuclear submarines 
are being dismantled. Nearly 40 submarines are waiting today 
for their nuclear fuel waste to be disposed. 
  For the past three years Severodvinsk has been under a 
threat 
of ecological catastrophe. A slightest error in handling 
nuclear fuel could lead to irreversible consequences. The 
volume of radioactive waste exceeded all accepted norms. 
  The reasons for this pileup was the fact that previously 
nuclear waste was shipped by sea to a place near Murmansk where 
it was loaded onto railway cars and transported to 
Chelyabinsk-65 for disposal. This was too expensive and the 
North Fleet command suggested the waste should be transported 
directly from Severodvinsk and Archangelsk. The State 
ecological expert commission was examining this proposal for 
several years, which resulted in a pileup of nuclear waste 
waiting to be transported. 
  Nevertheless, the first trainload has now been dispatched. 
The railway lines had to be repaired urgently for this 
occasion. The safety of the load was ensured by introduction of 
new specially designed containers. [Video shows train with

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pozdnyakov report from St. Petersburg under the </F>
"Atom" rubric: "`A Hungry Operator Means the Threat That 
Chernobyl Could Recur.' Leningrad Nuclear Plant Workers Picket 
Oblast Administration Seat"] 
  [Text] Workers of the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant 
(LNPP), wearing working uniform -- white overalls, special caps, 
and foot gear -- are picketing the building of the Leningrad 
Oblast Administration and the Leningrad Electric Power 
Department. The picketers demand that wages be paid to LNPP 
workers that have not been forthcoming since February. Although 
Leningrad Oblast governor Aleksandr Belyakov has promised to 
discuss the problem with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the 
financial situation of the Leningrad nuclear power plant workers 
has not changed. 
  According to Aleksandr Yeperin, LNPP general director, the 
power plant has been plunged into very severe financial straits 
by the intervention of the Russian government, which has 
prohibited the nuclear power plant from imposing financial 
sanctions on its debtors; hence, the LNPP often has to supply 
customers with electricity virtually for free. Despite the 
possibility of signing a contract for delivering electricity 
from Sosnovyy Bor to Finland -- to be paid in hard currency -- 
this is unlikely substantially to ease the LNPP's financial 
plight, because the plant management has to make regular 
payments for nuclear fuel (earlier the plant had a one-year 
reserve, but this has now been used up). 
  For the time being, the plant management is not going to 
take 
extreme measures and spend the money earmarked for fuel 
purchases on workers' wages, because a shutdown of the plant's 
reactor could become the first step toward a general power 
crisis in Russia. 
  Plant workers themselves, who took to the street to picket 
administration buildings, think that the government should 
drastically change its policy with regard to the nuclear power 
industry. They believe that the shortage of money in the 
industry could bring about not only a power crunch, but also 
even more serious consequences.

<F P=106> [Report by Fedor Yemchenko: "Nuclear-Powered Ship Ural Is </F>
Sinking in Dock"] 
  [Text] Another group of specialists is coming to Moscow to 
"extract" money from the state budget. This time the attack has 
been made by representatives of the shipbuilding sector, to be 
precise the "Baltiyskiy Zavod" from St. Petersburg. 
  The day before the plant trade union committee sent a 
telegram to Premier V. Chernomyrdin which said: "Your 
instructions to extinguish debts for work carried out on the 
construction of the nuclear-powered icebreaker Ural over 1993 
and the first quarter of this year are being ignored by the 
ministries of finances and transport. The government's inaction 
is making it impossible to continue the building of two 
nuclear-powered ships -- the icebreaker Ural and the cruiser 
Petr Velikiy. If your promises and directives are not binding 
for ministers, then it is time you retired." 
  "The situation at the plant is critical," says trade union 
committee chairman Vyacheslav Firyulin. "The halting of the 
building of these ships will not only affect our collective. 
The state will also incur enormous losses." 
  Of course, the "Baltiyskiy Zavod" collective's 
recommendation 
is not compulsory for the head of government. But it is 
scarcely sensible to dismiss SOS signals.

  [Text] Kiev, 24 May (AFP) -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk accused Russian President Boris Yeltsin Tuesday [24 
May] of violating international law by intervening in the 
political crisis between Ukraine and its separatist republic of 
Crimea. 
  "The Russian president may warn his own institutions but not 
the president of another state," Kravchuk told a group of World 
War II veterans he was meeting with. 
  Yeltsin last Friday called on Ukraine not to use force in 
responding to Crimea's decision to restore a 1992 constitution 
which grants the predominantly Russian-populated republic on the 
Black Sea greater autonomy from Kiev. 
  Yeltsin also said that neither Ukraine nor Russia should 
intervene in Crimea. 
  Kravchuk also wondered out loud before his audience Tuesday 
whether recent comments by Sergei Filatov, Yeltsin's chief of 
staff, represented "the position of the Russian state." 
  Filatov implicitly criticized Kravchuk on Monday by 
denouncing "those irresponsible politicians seeking to take 
advantage of the situation (in Crimea) in order to delay 
presidential elections" scheduled June 26 in Ukraine. 
  Kravchuk stressed that the Crimean issue must not become a 
source of discord between Ukraine and Russia. 
  He said that as long as Crimean leaders did not recognize 
that the autonomous republic was "an integral part of Ukraine" 
there was no room for compromise on the issue. 
  The Ukrainian parliament has declared the Crimean 
independence move "illegal" and has given the local legislature 
up until Monday to reverse its decision.

leadership of the ministries of internal affairs, and state 
administrations of Kharkiv and Belgorod oblasts met with 
journalists at the Ukrainian-Russian border. As is known, after 
signing the memorandum on border cooperation between Ukraine and 
Russia, some mass media disseminated a "sensation" on the 
renewal of the system of single borders of the CIS countries. 
It was stressed at the news conference that Ukraine and the 
Russian Federation are building their relations on the 
principles of friendship and good-neighborly relations and do 
not intend to violate the sovereign rights of the close 
neighbor. Each side strives to respect each other's state 
attributes, including state borders.

Makarchev and UKRINFORM correspondent Aleksey Trotsenko] 
  [Text] Kiev, 24 May -- The domestic political situation in 
the Ukraine and a number of international problems of interest 
to both sides were at the center of attention during talks that 
took place here today between the Ukrainian and British foreign 
ministers. Douglas Hurd, head of the British Foreign Office, is 
in Kiev on a one-day official visit. 
  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko described the 
atmosphere at the meeting as constructive and open. Answering a 
question about the situation in the Crimea following the 
adoption of a new constitution by the Crimean parliament, he 
said his position on this has been set out in a letter to the UN 
secretary general. The decision of the Crimean parliament is 
illegal and contradicts the Ukrainian Constitution, Zlenko 
stressed. 
  For his own part, Hurd said Great Britain supports the 
Ukraine's integrity and sovereignty of its present borders and 
he hopes the dispute between Kiev and the Simferopol authorities 
will be resolved "by peaceful means and without the use of 
force." The British minister said he discussed this problem 
with Russian leaders in Moscow this morning. He said Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
hold a similar point of view and consider that the problem must 
be resolved without the use of force. 
  Hurd also hopes bilateral relations between Ukraine and the 
European Union and NATO will develop successfully.

  [Text] Kiev, 24 May -- Douglas Hurd, British secretary of 
state for foreign affairs, arrived in Ukraine on an official 
one-day visit. The guest met with Anatoliy Zlenko, Ukraine's 
minister of foreign affairs, President Leonid Kravchuk, and 
other state leaders. "To us Ukraine is a very important European 
state," Mr. Hurd told journalists at Borispol Airport. 
  Asked what national security guarantees Britain can provide 
to Ukraine, Mr. Hurd said: "The fact that Ukraine has joined 
NATO's Partnership for Peace program is your security guarantee." 
  The foreign ministers of Ukraine and Great Britain met and 
held talks at Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Speaking 
to journalists, Anatoliy Zlenko said: "During our one-on-one 
conversation we discussed opportunities for strengthening our 
bilateral ties, focusing on issues facing the European Community 
today. In particular, these issues concern the international 
conference on the Pact of Stability in Europe [as received] to 
be held in Paris, Ukraine's steps toward membership in the 
European Union, and issues of primary importance for the 
development of economic cooperation." 
  Anatoliy Zlenko expressed his satisfaction with Mr. Hurd's 
visit to Kiev. "I am pleased to note," the Ukrainian minister 
said, "that our relations are good enough to allow us to be 
frank in our conversations." 
  Speaking of the possibility of international organizations 
(UN and CSCE) influencing settlement of the "Crimean problem," 
Mr. Hurd said that these issues will be studied, but he believes 
Ukraine is capable of solving the problem itself. 
  During the meeting between President Leonid Kravchuk and 
Douglas Hurd, the president said: "We are not demanding anything 
special from Crimea. We are only demanding adherence to the 
Ukrainian Constitution. Ukraine will under no circumstances use 
force to solve the `Crimean problem': All issues must be 
resolved only through negotiations."

  [Text] The press service of Ukraine's president and cabinet 
of ministers has issued a statement saying that high-ranking 
Russian officials have lately been ever more active in 
participating in a rowdy campaign of misinformation and innuendo 
being waged by the Russian mass media, aimed against Ukraine in 
connection with the situation in Crimea. These officials have 
thus imparted an official tone to this campaign. 
  Indeed, political party leaders making purposeful statements 
are one thing and people whose official duty ought to be taking 
care of the preservation and development of Russian-Ukrainian 
good-neighborliness, which would absolutely exclude any attempts 
to interfere in Ukraine's internal affairs, and whose voices are 
sounding in the anti-Ukrainian information campaign, are quite 
another. 
  Instead, we witness how these officials are taking on 
themselves the part of supreme judges and resorting to the 
rhetoric of dubious assertions, full of undisguised sympathy for 
the Crimean leadership's separatist aspirations. They are even 
resorting almost to overt threats to Ukraine, the leaders of 
which are acting fully in accordance with constitutional 
provisions and international norms and defending their state's 
territorial integrity. 
  In participating in the anti-Ukrainian information campaign, 
senior Moscow bureaucrats are encouraging Crimean separatists to 
violate Ukraine's Constitution and the legislation in force. In 
(?ostentatiously) expressing their concern in connection with 
the exacerbation of the situation surrounding the Crimean 
problem, they cannot find a single word of censure with regard 
to anticonstitutional actions and decisions by those actually to 
blame for the crisis. What is more, some strange logic makes 
them put responsibility on Ukrainian politicians who in their 
relations with Crimea do not trespass upon the boundary of 
constitutionalism. 
  The inappropriateness and tactlessness of certain Russian 
officials' statements are not conducive to friendly, 
good-neighborly relations between the two Slav states, which 
have common roots and whose problems of today are similar. This 
causes surprise and anxiety to the people of Ukraine. Ukraine 
has determined the strategy and priority of its policy towards 
Russia, which is a policy of friendship and partnership on a 
basis of equal rights, and consistently pursues this course and 
rejects diktat or condescension. 
  We express regret that some in Russia cannot understand this 
and still look on Ukraine as a dependent state. We call at this 
difficult time in the history of our relations for consideration 
and foresight. This is said in the statement by the press 
service of Ukraine's president and cabinet of ministers.

  [Text] The mid-April GATT meeting in Morocco, which was 
attended by delegations of about 140 member nations, resulted in 
signing an agreement on institution of the World Trade 
Organisation [WTO] which ushered in a new era of global trade, 
tariff, custom, investment and other economic relations. 
Henceforth, GATT/WTO will assume UN-like dimensions with its 
member nations accounting for over 90 per cent of global trade 
turn-over. 
  The so multitudinous membership leaves but a handful of 
nations outside the GATT/WTO structure. Nineteen more nations 
are presently officializing their accedence to it, Russia, 
Belarus and Ukraine included. 
  Russia started the process on 16 June 1993. Ukraine, who 
assumed the GATT observer status on 14 July 1992, started its 
similar process of accedence to GATT only on 17 December 1993. 
Russia is widely expected to accede to GATT/WTO as a 
full-fledged member before 1994 elapses. Ukraine is only 
drafting its memorandum of foreign trade, the key document 
necessary for accedence to GATT. 
  According to Serhiy Osyka, Ukraine's Deputy Minister for 
foreign economic relations and GATT permanent representative, 
the longer Ukraine contents itself with the role of an outsider, 
the more difficult the process will be of normalizing its trade 
and economic relations with GATT/WTO member nations including 
Ukraine's neighbors, Russia and Belarus. 
  The Ukrainian official sounds very pessimistic on Ukraine's 
bilateral economic agreements and their efficiency in Ukraine 
gaining the MFN [Most-Favored Nation] status, which invariably 
presupposes full-fledged GATT membership. 
  Mr. Osyka urges top priority to be assigned by the Ukrainian 
leadership to Ukraine's accedence to GATT/WTO, moreover so that 
the world community is ready and willing to assist Ukraine is so 
doing. 
  The Ukrainian delegation to GATT is reported to have stepped 
up of late its efforts toward the speediest possible 
officialization of Ukraine's accedence to GATT/WTO. 
  Technical aid to Ukraine may assume a more tangible 
dimension, when Ukraine's interdepartmental commission for 
accedence to GATT/WTO visits Washington, DC, in early June. 
  A visit is also contemplated to be paid to Kiev by a team of 
experts with the US mission to Geneva and officers of the GATT 
Secretariat for meetings with top Ukrainian officials in late 
May.

  [Text] The Westron US-Ukrainian joint venture [jv], which 
was co-founded by Kharkov's Khartron and the US-based Westinhous 
Electric Corp., will manufacture automated systems for control 
over technological processes, Valeriy Kazakov, Ukraine's deputy 
minister for engineering, MIC [military industrial complex] and 
conversion, disclosed in an interview to UKRINFORM. 
  Within the broad framework of the Nunn-Lugar program (which 
provides for the Ukrainian defense industry's conversion) a 
pilot defense conversion project will be financed by the USA to 
the tune of 5 million US dollars. Besides, Westinhous will 
additionally allocate 20 million US dollars from its own funds. 
  Westinhous officers are presently in Kharkov to register the 
jv and settle some technical problems. 
  The jv's automated control systems are supposed to be 
mounted 
at six power generating units of Ukrainian nuclear power plants. 
The US partner's contribution to manufacture of the first such 
system will amount to 90 per cent of total costs, the last one 
is supposed to be financed by the Ukrainian party by 90 per cent. 
  Meanwhile, as many an expert in Ukraine maintains, the US 
party has been rather sluggish in implementing the Nunn-Lugar 
defense conversion program. 
  A mixed US-Ukrainian intergovernmental commission is in 
charge of the program's implementation. Its Ukrainian component 
is headed by Mr. Kazakov. Its first meeting was summoned in 
March 1994. 
  The latest visit to the USA by a Ukrainian delegation led by 
vice-premier Valeriy Shmarov resulted, in particular, in an 
agreed list of 35 Ukrainian defense enterprises to undergo 
conversion. 
  On 26 May the list will be published in the USA to 
facilitate 
US partner selection for joint ventures to be set up in Ukraine 
to assist in defense industry conversion.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has taken the 
decision to strip journalists from the Ostankino Television and 
Radio Company working on Ukrainian territory of their 
accreditation. The ministry accuses these journalists of 
provocative reporting of events in Odessa, Crimea, and also 
eastern Ukraine. Evidently, according to their logic, 
everything has started because of journalists and has nothing to 
do with politicians.

  [Text] Ukraine's outstanding debt notwithstanding, 
Turkmenistan resumed its natural gas supplies to Ukraine on 13 
May in accordance with a 7 May agreement. Turkmen gas supplies 
are said to have reached a daily average of 53 million cu. m. 
  According to Bogdan Babiy, chief engineer of Ukrgazprom's 
dispatching service, Turkmen gas supplies during the early days 
since their resumption exceeded 75 to 80 million cu. m. a day, 
but presently have been temporarily reduced to 20 to 25 million 
cu. m. a day. 
  According to the Ukrgazprom spokesperson, within the 13 
through 20 May period Turkmenistan piped 377.5 million cu. m. of 
natural gas to Ukraine, which was by 160.8 million cu. m. less 
than the agreed figure. 
  The issue of Ukrainian indebtedness extinguishment remains 
unsettled with charges for gas transit across Russia's territory 
posing as a major problem. 
  The latter was supposed to be negotiated by the two 
interested parties on 19 May, but the talks were postponed to 24 
May. 
  However, on 19 May the Ukrainian side did have talks with 
Russia's Gazprom officers, which focused on progress made in 
extinguishing Ukraine's fuel indebtedness to Russia following a 
scheme, which was adopted on 12 April 1994. 
  As of 22 May 1994, Ukraine's debt to Gazprom stood at about 
600 million US dollars. 
  According to Mikhail Kovalko, chairman of the State 
Committee 
for oil and gas, non-payment by Ukrainian gas consumer 
enterprises resulted in their aggregate debt to the tune of 15 
trillion krb. (or about 300 million USD). 
  Enterprises under the Ministries of industry, engineering, 
MIC [military industrial complex] and conversion, and the State 
Committee for communal services and public utilities, are among 
major fuel debtors, which the Ukrainian government has 
repeatedly admonished for failing to repay their gas debts as 
prescribed. 
  Speaking at a recent Cabinet session acting premier Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy threatened to apply extremely harsh measure to the 
non-payer enterprises including terminated gas supplies, 
bringing them to court of arbitration, etc. The government's 
earlier resolution said, in particular, that responsibility for 
any consequences, which might ensue from these measures, would 
rest entirely with culprit enterprise managers. 
  According to Mr. Kovalko, on 19 May gas supplies were either 
drastically curtailed or altogether suspended to as many as 
1,300 state-run enterprises. 
  However, as Mr. Kovalko maintains, the enterprises are 
supposed to cope with the gas debt repayment problem in a matter 
of days, which will allow the State Committee for oil and gas to 
significantly reduce its own indebtedness to Russia's Gazprom. 
  Incidentally, Mr. Kovalko is expected to top the VR 
Committee 
for Ukraine's fuel and power complex. 
  In the meantime, Russian natural gas flow to Ukraine has not 
subsided with daily natural gas piping averaging over 585 
million cu. m., according to Ukrgazprom, which is within the 
agreed supply amounts. Over the 13 May through 20 period, 
4,095.2 million cu. m. of Russian natural gas were piped to 
Ukraine. 
  As Mr. Kovalko disclosed, stable Russian natural gas 
supplies 
and resumed Turkmen gas piping allowed Ukragazprom to start 
piping the planned natural gas amounts to Ukraine's underground 
storages to pool reserve stocks, since Ukraine's domestic 
consumption of natural gas within the same period was 1,310.9 
million cu. m. only with averaged daily consumption of about 
187.27 million cu. m. 
  According to Mr. Kovalko, as of 20 May, about 2 b. cu. m. of 
natural gas were piped into underground storaging facilities. 
However, this is a meager fraction of the required 30 b. cu. m. 
stock. Moreover, Ukrgazprom's action was belated in view of 
lacking means to pay for imports, whereas the unsettled issue of 
payment with both Russian and Turkmen natural gas exporters 
makes the situation a shaky one and fraught with the danger of 
gas supply discontinuance, maybe, without further notice.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 23/5/1994 -- "We are aware that 
the responsibility for a successful implementation of economic 
reforms was assumed by the top leadership and first of all by 
the head of state which accepted us as co-authors of the reform 
program," declared today at a meeting with President Snegur the 
vice-president of the World Bank (WB), Welfred Thaiwitz, reports 
a presidential press service communique. The WB will continue 
to support financially reforms in Moldova. The WB experts say 
that some progress has already been registered: stability of 
national currency and decrease in the inflation rates. 
President Snegur welcomed the WB's idea of opening a permanent 
mission in Moldova and expressed his hope that the latter, 
together with the IMF, will contribute to economic recovery. 
Snegur mentioned two aspects of major importance for a 
successful implementation of reforms -- political stability and 
rapid privatization of state property. It was specified that 
the Ministry of Privatization, which was recently created, was 
meant to serve as a catalyst for the process, to make it 
consistent and irreversible, says the press communique.

Democratic Party of Moldova [PDAM], reveals unsteadiness in his 
political views, declared to BASA Valentin Krylov, a leader of 
the Socialist Party. According to Krylov, previously, President 
Snegur declared that the president should be above any party's 
interests. "It might seem that the president has changed his 
political views, thought it is possible that he follows two 
objectives: to give more strength to the PDAM before local 
elections and to prepare to run as an agrarian for President in 
1996, which are expected to be multi-party," said Krylov, 
mentioning that "today it is not too early to consider the next 
presidential elections and the PDAM will gain much strength from 
Snegur's membership."

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 23/5/1994 -- The Draft Program 
on Governmental Activity for 1994-97, which was examined last 
week by the government, confirms Moldovan authorities' 
commitment to reforms. "To stop the decline and achieve an 
economic growth is our purpose," stated Premier Andrei Sangheli, 
adding that the program will lay special stress on social 
protection; that is, it will not sacrifice population's living 
standards in the name of reforms. On the other hand, the 
government says the program aims at "assuring a qualitative leap 
in the transition to a market economy." The program aims to 
create an economy with two sectors -- state and private -- which 
will have as foundation "the rational combination of state 
regulation and the creation of a favorable environment for 
developing market economy relations." An important part of the 
new government's strategy for 1994-95 is to transform all state 
enterprises into joint-stock companies with the state 
controlling a majority of shares of the strategically important 
enterprises to accelerate privatization. In 1994, about 1,600 
state enterprises will be privatized. It is clear that if 
privatization will be efficiently and swiftly carried out, the 
government will have to revise the reform program. According to 
some experts, a failure might aggravate the situation, thus 
destroying any chance to improve the Moldovan economy. Ion 
Gutu, chairman of the Governmental Commission for Economic 
Reforms, stated that "the start of the real privatization 
process which stagnated during recent months is an important 
task included in the Draft Program on Governmental activity for 
1994-97." This statement and government's haste to make 
decisions display Moldovan officials' intention to give reform 
another "speed." The government will have to face the realities 
that press upon the Moldovan economy. The aggravating financial 
blockage provoked by the unpaid salaries has discouraging 
effects. The statements made by the deputy head of the 
Gasification Department Mihai Lesnic that "Moldova's debts for 
natural gas supply from Russia stands at 257.7 billion rubles 
($163.6 million)" is quite a waning. According to the 5 May 
agreement signed between Moldova Vice Premier Valentin Cunev and 
the GAZPROM gas company in Moscow, Moldova has to pay its debts 
by 15 June. This seems to be implausible taking into account 
that only 8 percent of all debts have been paid to date. 
GAZPROM's stipulations that future supplies, beginning 1 June, 
must be paid in advance could have catastrophic consequences for 
an economy that cannot guarantee energy necessities. In the 
last months Moldova's debts toward Russian gas suppliers has 
increased by about $100 million. Meanwhile, the salary arrears 
tend to increase and exceeded in agriculture more than 90 
million lei despite the government's intention to liquidate all 
debts. In this situation, the government will have to deal more 
with the most stringent problems; otherwise, they might 
undermine the elaboration of long-term programs.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev's idea of a Eurasian 
Union has become the subject of unfair political discussions, 
his spokesman Nurlan Danenov said. 
  In a statement in Alma-Ata [Almaty], he accused some of the 
media of trying to capitalize on differing approaches to the 
concept by CIS leaders by driving a wedge between them. 
  "I do not think they will succeed, but they may certainly 
create a nasty background for some time. No doubt, this plays 
into someone's hands", the spokesman said. 
  Danenov expressed surprise at media reports saying 
Nazarbayev 
had already taken the idea off the agenda. 
  He said "since it has never been put forward for formal 
discussions, the idea cannot be taken of the agenda." The 
spokesman ceded that there could be a mixed response to the 
concept both in and outside the Republic. 
  Danenov mentioned that the emergence of the Eurasian Union 
concept followed the unsatisfactory state of affairs within the 
Commonwealth. He said that many had overlooked the possibility 
of forming a union by more promising CIS member states as a 
strategic line at promoting more productive links between other 
republics of the former Soviet Union. "But there could be no 
question of reinstating the former Soviet Union or some kind of 
a confederation," the spokesman said. 
  Nazarbayev does not believe that the CIS had run out of its 
potential as the instrument for a civilized parting of ways 
after the break up of the Soviet empire, he said. 
  Danenov pointed to the significance of a three-nation 
agreement (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan) to set up a 
common economic area describing it as a new stage in CIS 
economic cooperation. He said the treaty which was open for 
other states to join "has laid down the cornerstone of a new and 
more effective entity within the Commonwealth." The spokesman 
went on to say that the three Central Asian presidents at last 
month's meeting on the shores of the Issyk Kul Lake had stressed 
the need for further searches of new forms and shapes of CIS 
cooperation. 
  IF Note: Nazarbayev and his Uzbek and Kyrgyz counterparts 
Islam Karimov and Askar Akayev are said to have agreed not to 
raise the question of a Eurasian Union focusing on greater 
cooperation between their countries instead. Unlike Akayev who 
threw weight behind the EAU [Eurasian Union] idea, Karimov made 
it clear on several occasions that he was sceptical about it. 
However, all of them agreed that the latest tripartite 
agreement was a new stage in the promotion of CIS cooperation. 
  Both Karimov and Nazarbayev reiterated this during the 
opening of Kazakh Days in Tashkent. They said the three-nation 
deal would be to the benefit of their economies as it opened up 
unlimited opportunities for cooperation between entrepreneurs 
and direct contacts between plants and industrial sectors. 
Nazarbayev said the idea of lifting all trade barriers between 
CIS states had first emerged during his talks with President 
Karimov in Tashkent in January. The Kazakh leader stressed that 
other CIS states could benefit from the experience the two 
countries had gained since.

  [Text] Kyrgyzstan has already been through the first and 
the most difficult stage on its way to democracy and market 
economy, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev said in an interview with 
INTERFAX today. 
  He stressed that entrepreneurship was developing in 
Kyrgyzstan and that a class of entrepreneurs had appeared in the 
Republic. Akayev pointed out that the larger this class the more 
stable the Kyrgyz community would be. 
  However, Akayev admitted that the society in the Republic 
was 
quickly being divided into the rich and the poor. That is why 
the state policy must concentrate on social security, Akayev 
remarked. He announced that the World Bank would allot from $40 
million to $60 million for support of the social sphere. 
  Akayev said that the state treasury was failing to collect 
all due taxes. He considered this to be one of the main 
problems in the Republic. In 1993 all taxes collected amounted 
to 14 percent of GNP. "As a result we cannot pay people their 
salaries and pensions and cannot finance urgent social and 
economic programs, Akayev pointed out. 
  However, he added that Kyrgyzstan had the lowest inflation 
rate in the CIS (4.9 percent in April). He said this had become 
possible due to the tough monetary credit policy pursued by the 
National Bank and to the support of the IMF and the World Bank.

  [Text] Baku, 23 May (TURAN) -- "Russian troops will not be 
brought into the conflict zone since this matter will be 
discussed within the framework of the CSCE. Azerbaijan did not 
sign Moscow's agreement providing for the introduction of the 
troops from only one country to the conflict zone," said 
President Aliyev on 21 May. 
  As a result, the agreement, "On measures to implement the 18 
Febraury protocol," proposed by Pavel Grachev and providing for 
Russia's mediation in the separation of the warring parties 
without the CSCE, failed. 
  It is now clear that Baku took advantage of the 
contradictions between Russia and the CSCE in this matter. 
While the U.S. State Department head for the division on the 
Newly Independents States (NIS), James Collins, persuaded Andrey 
Kozirev to give the troops status of an international force, 
Azerbaijan's Defense Minisiter Mamedov delayed the signing of 
the Russian agreement during the Moscow talks. At the same 
time, the Chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group, Jan Eliasson, 
shuttled between Baku and Yerevan trying to convince 
Ter-Petrosyan not to hurry to accept Grachev's plan. 
  After that it was obvious that the CSCE intends to push for 
the agreement "On measures to regulate a cease-fire schedule" 
and when military observers of this organization arrived in the 
region, Baku said that it prefers mediation by international 
forces and not only by Russia. 
  Such tactics on the part of Baku are of the ultimate risk 
since an infuriated Pavel Grachev can teach a lesson to 
President Aliyev for such "boldness." 
  Earlier, Azerbaijan has been punished with defeats on the 
front for ignoring Moscow's interests. Presently the situation 
can repeat itself. According to Azeri miltary intelligence, 
recently Russian tank battalion, artillery and special 
battalions have been transported from Armenia to Karabakh. At 
the same time, two motor-infantry regiments of Armenia's 
National Army were transported to the conflict zone as well. 
The same source reports that Armenian troops have been 
concentrated along the Terterskiy region direction. 
  Judging by all, further development of the events will 
depend 
upon whether the West will permit Russian troops to be 
introduced into Azerbaijan.

  [Text] Baku, 23 May (AZERTAC)--Today, State Adviser of 
Azerbaijan Mr. Vafa Gulizadeh has made a statement, which says 
that the Armenian armed forces are committing barbarian actions 
on the occupied Azeri territory destroying dwelling houses, 
communications and agricultural installations. According to V. 
Gulizadeh, this information has been confirmed by a deserter 
from the Armenian Army. The deserter said that the Armenians 
committed those actions since they knew that they would soon 
leave the occupied Azeri territory. 
  V. Gilizadeh has also said that the Azerbaijani President 
Geydar Aliyev appealed to the Chairman of the CSCE's Minsk Group 
J. Eliasson and regular member states of the CSCE with a request 
to bring pressure to bear upon Armenia to stop committing 
barbarian actions on the Azeri territory. The President Aliyev 
has also appealed to the UN Secretary General Mr. Butrus-Ghali 
and asked him to inform the members of the UN Security Council 
about these crimes committed by Armenians. The state adviser 
thinks that the world community must pay attention to the 
felonies committed by the Armenian armed forces and take 
measures in order to stop barbarian actions.

  [Text] Baku 24 May (AZERTAC)--The parliament crisis 
continues in Azerbaijan. This crisis began last week when 15 
MP's (almost a third of the parliament) had left the parliament 
hall signifying their protest against the signing of the Bishkek 
Protocol. This action of the MPs has deprived the parliament of 
quorum without which the parliament can not fulfil its work. 
  Yesterday, the parliament appealed to the President Aliyev 
and requested him to reduce the quorum from 34 to 26 voices. A 
proper draft law was presented to the president. "It is the 
most acceptable measure to find a way from the crisis,' the 
parliaments speaker said. 
  There were other proposals of the MP's, e.g. to appeal to 
the 
"rebellios" MPs and make a request for cooperation. According 
to the premier Surat Guseynov, it is necessary to do "for the 
sake of national accord." There also was a radical proposal to 
dismiss the parliament and delegate its powers to the president.

<F P=106> [Sokhbet Mamedov report: "Baku Police Disperses Opposition </F>
Rally and Arrests IZVESTIYA Correspondent"] 
  [Text] Baku -- According to various figures, between 200 
and 500 participants in a rally in Baku received injuries of 
varying degrees of seriousness and were taken to police stations. 
  This incident took place on the day of "Kurban Bayrama" 
("Festival of the Sacrifice"), observed throughout the Muslim 
world. At the time when President Geydar Aliyev was greeting 
people on the occasion of the holiday, the capital's arm of the 
law was dispersing crowds of people trying to get onto the 
central square. The police did not particularly stand on 
ceremony -- citizens and even deputies were crammed into buses 
and dispatched to interim detention centers. 
  The catalyst in the exacerbation of the already complex 
relations between the authorities and the opposition forces in 
Azerbaijan was the fact that Baku has agreed to the terms of a 
truce in Karabakh and to having peacekeeping troops brought into 
the republic. The republic's parliament refused to discuss this 
problem. Deputies who demanded that this question be included 
on the agenda were accused of trying to destabilize the 
situation in the republic so as, subsequently, to take 
advtantage of that in order to take power into their own hands. 
Then the opposition adopted a decision to hold a rally. 
  The authorities ignored their opponents' opinions and 
organized a persecution campaign against the leaders of the 
People's Front and the "Musavat" and National Independence of 
Azerbaijan parties. Extensive powers were given to the police, 
who then more than justified the hopes pinned on them. 
  Having been a witness to the police beating one of the 
participants in the rally, your IZVESTIYA correspondent turned 
to an officer standing nearby. This proved to be enough for 
them to put me in the bus and take me to the rayon police 
station, keeping me there for over three hours. Since the 
leadership of the police station was unable to give me an 
intelligible answer as to why a journalist was arrested, and 
consequently deprived of the possibility of carrying out his 
professional duty, this question has been re-addressed to the 
prosecutor's office of Nasiminskiy Rayon.

<F P=106> [Vitaliy Denisov report: "Abkhaz Question Threatens </F>
Georgian Crisis of Power. Republic's Parliament Not Ready To 
Compromise"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- The topic of Abkhazia continues to 
dominate sessions of the Georgian parliament. Attitudes toward 
the Russian leadership's statement about the introduction of CIS 
peacemaking forces to the conflict zone have sharply divided the 
top legislative organ into supporters and bitter opponents of 
this step. This could lead to a crisis of power in the republic 
and even to a possible change of political course. 
  The opinions held by deputies in different factions are 
largely diametrically opposed. The Republicans, as before, are 
insisting on a parliamentary debate on the issue of preserving 
statehood, and on the legality of the agreements on Abkhazia 
signed 4 April and 14 May. Republican deputy Ivlian Khaindrava 
called them the "political and legal formulation of the results 
of Georgia's military failures, which will directly and 
unambiguously lead to the loss of Abkhazia." 
  The refusal by most parliamentarians to include these issues 
on the agenda prompted a stormy reaction from the Republicans, 
who staged a walkout and announced that they would be boycotting 
the sessions. They were joined by deputies from the Merab 
Kostav Society, who are insisting, aside from anything else, on 
the abolition of the institution of head of state and a 
transition to exclusively parliamentary rule. 
  But if some people are worried solely about the 
Georgian-Abkhaz agreements that have been signed, others are 
concerned about the position of a third party -- Russia. 
People's Front leader Nodar Natadze, for instance, assesses the 
great northern neighbor's peacemaking efforts merely as an 
attempt to "quietly" seize Georgia's Black Sea coastline and to 
federalize the republic into part of Russia.... 
  Representatives of the parliamentary majority are also 
talking about boycotting the work of the top legislative organ 
of power. Roman Miminoshvili, deputy [head] of the parliamentary 
commission for deputies' ethics, accused the opposition of 
destructive actions, sabotage, and antistate debates leading to 
the deepening of the crisis and drawing Georgia into war and 
chaos, and directly stated that such a step is possible. Roin 
Liparteliani, leader of the Agrarians, is not even ruling out 
the possibility of parliament's dissolution. 
  In these circumstances, it is impossible to have a 
constructive discussion of any documents on Abkhazia -- the 
language of ultimatums is not helping at all. Zurab Zhvaniya, 
general secretary of the Union of Georgian Citizens, even 
proposed declaring a moratorium on open parliamentary debate of 
the issues relating to Abkhazia. Will his appeal be heeded? 
  Georgian citizens have differing assessments of the question 
of introducing CIS peacemaking troops to Abkhazia. According to 
the latest opinion poll staged by the newspaper SVOBODNAYA 
GRUZIYA, 62.6 percent of Tbilisi people do not see them as any 
reliable guarantee of the safe return of refugees. Although 
most nonetheless believe that the conflict cannot be resolved 
without compromise. But it is the people's elected 
representatives above all who will have to learn the art of 
compromise. Otherwise, they may talk themselves into a new war.

  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Georgia plans to 
introduce its own currency unit, the lari, by next spring, 
republican Deputy Prime Minister Teimuraz Basilia said in an 
interview with Georgian television yesterday. He said that the 
government and the National Bank are currently making efforts to 
strengthen the coupon and to make it the sole means of payment, 
ousting the Russian ruble from the market. However, Teimuraz 
Basilia said, "Some members of the Cabinet of Ministers not only 
do not support, but are even resisting all the measures we plan 
to introduce, both in the money and credit sphere and 
particularly in the area of privatization." 
  The deputy prime minister stressed that it is not a matter 
of 
no confidence in the government, but of the personal interests 
of persons who would lose their portfolios if privatization is 
carried through.

circumstances, including the situation in the Transcaucasus. 
  The spokesman of Armenia's Foreign Ministry stressed the 
Republic's constructive and many-sided involvement in the 
activity of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. He recalled 
that Armenia's Foreign Minister Vagan Papazyan is going to take

at the Karabakh fronts is unchanged. Though both Karabakh and

country once more,'' Brazauskas said.

<F P=106> ["Transcript" of press conference by Estonian President </F>
Lennart Meri and Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev in Tallinn on 24 May] 
  [Text] President Meri: We are very happy to announce that 
we had a friendly and fruitful discussion with Andrei Kozyrev 
about the still unsolved questions that we have to solve between 
the Russian Federation and the Republic of Estonia. And we have 
the feeling that we have created a new atmosphere and hope for 
fruitful cooperation in solving those problems .... 
  FM [Foreign Minister] Kozyrev: I agree with this description 
...Yes those two issues you know it is the withdrawal of troops 
and our strong desire and determination to actually withdraw as 
soon as possible. ... Second element I understand that the 
Estonian leadership is also determined and eager to look into 
the question of military pensioners in order to solve this too. 
I think that these two major desires combinations, negotiations 
meet we have the issue solved [sentence as published]. We have 
to translate this political will and the climate which the 
president has described. We have agreed to arrange as soon as 
possible a meeting of special representatives on the level of 
deputy foreign ministers. 
  President Meri: ...and I would like to add that we discussed 
in a very frank way the two problems which are not interlinked 
with each other. I am happy to announce here that FM Kozyrev 
fully agrees that we will proceed according to the Estonian 
legislation and to those government decisions, and that there is 
already enough material to hope that both issues will be solved 
as soon as possible. 
  Question (in Russian): What steps are needed to solve 
military pensioner question? 
  FM Kozyrev: There are some difficulties. Some of them are 
probably related to existing legislation and decisions. But, 
again as I said, these two wills and determinations 
...substance... And I hope this will happen very soon. And I 
hope the...will be encouraged and instructed to do that... 
  Question: Will Russian troops be out by deadline of Aug. 31? 
  FM Kozyrev: It depends upon the speed of the solution of 
talks...which I have described. We have agreement that there 
is still time to meet this deadline. 
  Meri: And according to the atmosphere we had, I have not the 
slightest doubt that this deadline will be met. 
  Question: Any progress today? 
  Meri: Yes, of course. You see, it was a very frank 
meeting...at the very moment the press....So I would not like to 
go into details. But we are happy that we have met, we can 
continue our meeting today... 
  FM Kozyrev: I alway enjoy meeting Mr. President. And I 
want to think of myself as a friend of President Meri. We know 
each other from times of the Soviet past, when we first were 
Foreign Ministers of Soviet Republics. So it's really for 
me...this kind of long-standing relationship and really I think 
there is a good chance to solve those issues in a civilized 
manner. 
  Question: Will there be a signed agreement in the near 
future between Estonia and Russia? 
  President Meri and FM Kozyrev: That's our strongest common 
will. 
  Question: When will the meeting of special representatives 
take place? 
  Meri: It's not a matter of months, it's a matter of weeks, 
perhaps days. 
  Question: Issue of retired militaries? 
  FM Kozyrev: The statement made recently by President Meri 
when he met with the Ambassadors here sounds promising. That's 
exactly our intention to explore how this promise could be 
translated into a practical....agreement and I would like to 
solve as progressive (?) as possible, also because it is our 
common desire to overcome the stumbling blocks of this road and 
create stage to overcome new page of relations. We want best 
possible relations with Estonia. 
  Meri: I will like to seize the opportunity and to tell you 
that from the number of the retired ex-Soviet servicemen, 5,600 
are 60 years old or older. That is according to the decrees 
passed by the government already something which cannot be 
overlooked...which is...problems will be solved. 
  The meeting took place at Kadriorg Palace before the opening 
of the Ministerial meeting of the Council of the Baltic Sea 
States today in Tallinn. Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik 
described the two hour meeting as a "good start" and a "certain 
start of a dialogue." Luik added "The general mood was 
positive" making it "possible to go forward."

  [Excerpts] Today is Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev's second day in Tallinn. Estonia has been expecting 
this visit to lead to a positive outcome: A clear pledge from 
Russia to withdraw her troops from here by the end of August. 
[passage omitted] 
  Now that the Russian foreign minister has met President 
Lennart Meri, the Russian side, too, has been emphasizing that 
it is necessary to change the level of the talks delegations. 
  The Russian side's current positions were clarified to 
Estonian radio by Galina Sidorova, adviser to Andrey Kozyrev. 
  [Sidorova, in Russian with superimposed Estonian 
translation] 
The meeting, which lasted as long as two hours, demonstrated in 
the Russian side's opinion that ice has begun to shift. We see 
this meeting as a kind of favorable political impetus. One 
cannot call it a move forward, though. We have formed the 
opinion that Estonia is prepared to display an understanding of 
our attitude to the issue of the Russian military pensioners who 
live in Estonia. The Russian position continues to be the same: 
The military pensioners' issue must be resolved together with 
the agreement on troop withdrawal. Russia continues to think 
that guarantees for social protection must be extended to all 
military pensioners; all military pensioners must be able to 
live on an equal footing if they so wish. 
  Much depends now on the next move, which is the meeting of 
deputy foreign ministers as representatives of the two 
countries' leaders. Concrete documents would then be under 
discussion, and it would become clear to what extent Estonia is 
prepared to make concessions. If an agreement is reached, it is 
possible that the Russian troops will be withdrawn by 31 August. 
I repeat, that is only in case an agreement is reached.

  [Text] In a press release today, the Estonian Foreign 
Ministry claims that the number of persons in Estonia 
demobilized from the former USSR Armed Forces is on the 
increase. On 19 May Aleksandr Trofimov, Russian Ambassador to 
Estonia, presented figures to President Lennart Meri, showing 
that the number of the Russian military pensioners has risen 
from 9,040 to 10,640. According to the Foreign Ministry, about 
1,600 Russian military pensioners living in Estonia are under 
50; almost 4,000 are aged 50 to 60; and 5,170 are over 60. At 
the same time the press release states that the Estonian 
authorities have difficulties obtaining information from the 
Russian Government about the size of the Russian military units 
deployed in Estonia and the number of military pensioners in 
Estonia. Additionally, it is unknown how many Russian 
servicemen are engaged in Estonia in civilian clothes, the 
Foreign Ministry's press release says.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 24, BNS -- Finance Minister and 
Liberal Democratic Party [ELDP] member Heiki Kranich declared in 
a statement released yesterday that he cannot continue as a 
member of Prime Minister Mart Laar's Cabinet, today's issue of 
the RAHVA HAAL newspaper writes. 
  Kranich affirmed that he is prepared to fulfill his 
obligations until the Pro Patria congress. "If Mart Laar should 
after that continue as prime minister, I find it impossible to 
continue as Cabinet member," he stated. 
  Kranich blamed the premier for having repeatedly gone 
against 
the rules in signing state guarantees for loans. "The justice 
chancellor has qualified his actions as violation of the 
Constitution. As a result, monetary obligations binding on the 
Republic of Estonia have been assumed," Kranich stated. 
  The finance minister noted that Laar, denying his 
violations, 
has taken steps to remove from the government the ministers who 
pointed out his mistakes. 
  Culture and Education Minister Paul-Eerik Rummo, who is 
also the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, told the 
RAHVA HAAL yesterday he doesn't plan to leave the government in 
the next few days. 
  The ELDP council and the Liberals faction in parliament 
yesterday announced their decision to authorize Rummo and 
Kranich to continue in the government pending the outcome of the 
Pro Patria congress. 
  The ELDP also proposed that all ruling coalition parties 
should get together to make up their minds about a candidate for 
new prime minister as well as other possible Cabinet reshuffles. 
  The other ruling coalition members -- the Estonian Rural 
Centrist Party, the Estonian National Independence Party and the 
Estonian Social Democratic Party -- said last week that their 
ministers will not leave the government. Pro Patria member, 
Foreign Minister Juri Luik also told reporters yesterday he will 
not be stepping down until the Pro Patria congress. 
  A meeting of the Pro Patria council yesterday decided that 
election of new party chairman doesn't necessarily imply 
nomination of new premier. 
  The Pro Patria congress is scheduled for June 11. On the top 
of the agenda are election of new chairman for the party and the 
situation in the government and the ruling coalition. 
  Laar said on Friday [20 May] he regards decisions of the 
congress as binding for himself. "If Pro Patria elects a new 
chairman, I'll resign," the premier promised.

  [Text] Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin had a telephone 
conversation with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on 24 May 
in the afternoon. They discussed the division of the Black Sea 
Fleet and the basing of Russian ships in Crimea. Officially, no 
details have been reported. 
  INTERFAX learned from sources in the Russian delegation that 
the fist draft of the final document on the settlement of the 
Black Sea Fleet issues had not been approved by the two parties. 
  Moscow has insisted that Sevastopol be the main base of the 
Russian Navy and that the Ukrainian fleet be based beyond the 
city limits. It can be stationed in Balaklava (Crimea) or in 
Odessa. 
  Russia wanted the document to contain the following formula, 
"Sevastopol is the main Russian navy base in Crimea." Kiev 
proposed another formula, "The main Russian navy base in Crimea 
will be stationed in Sevastopol." 
  A Russian delegation expert clarified that the Ukrainian 
formula meant that all military infrastructure in Sevastopol 
would belong to Ukraine. He added that the issue on leasing 
would be mentioned in a separate agreement. 
  Russia wanted to avoid the term "leasing" and to mention 
"utilization in accordance with the intergovernmental agreement" 
instead. 
  On 24 May at 2100 the talks are still continuing. The 
Ukrainian party put forward new proposals on the division of the 
Black Sea Fleet within the scope of the March agreements between 
the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. In accordance with these 
agreement Moscow would receive 699 ships and supplementary boats 
of the Black Sea Fleet and Kiev would receive 164 units. 
  Kiev wanted its quota to be increased.

  [Text] The Political Council of the National Salvation 
Front (NSF) called on its supporters, the State Duma and all 
public leaders and political parties to avoid moves that could 
lead to the betrayal of Crimea and to work to protect the 
Crimean republic and Crimean Constitution. 
  The NSF Political Council said a dramatic conflict was about 
to erupt in Crimea and the Ukrainian leaders would be to blame 
for it. The Crimeans' quest for the protection of the age-long 
ties with Russia have been threatened by Kiev, the Council said. 
  The Russian president and government were equally 
responsible 
for what was happening on the peninsula. Now that Ukraine was 
running up an enormous debt to Russia, the NSF Council said, the 
Russian leaders could resort to absolutely reliable and peaceful 
means of averting violence in Crimea. 
  The NSF Council declared the Crimean developments to be a 
test of the patriotic declarations made by many local political 
parties and movements.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 24 TASS -- The division of Black Sea 
Fleet infrastructure, including coastal fortifications, 
artillery, fleet aviation, storages and apartments of Sevastopol 
servicemen, was a stumbling stone at negotiations of the Russian 
and Ukrainian premiers on the Black Sea Fleet and the Crimea. 
  The agreement on gradual division of the Black Sea Fleet 
signed by the Russian and Ukrainian presidents on April 15, 
1994, was too general. It voiced the Ukrainian holding of 
ten-fifteen per cent of warships and auxiliary vessels, and 
separate basing of the Russian and Ukrainian fleets. The 
document also instructed ministries and departments to 
coordinate conditions and procedure of the division. 
  A reason for failure of the Black Sea Fleet talks between 
the 
Russian and Ukrainian defence ministers in April was their 
different understanding of the infrastructure notion, said 
Vice-Admiral of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff Vladimir 
Kryazhev.

  [Text] Each of the parties proposed its own version of the 
final document at the talks between the Russian and Ukrainian 
governmental delegations headed by Premiers Viktor Chernomyrdin 
and Yukhym Zvyahilskyy in Moscow. Earlier on the same day, the 
two premiers had held a private meeting. 
  Interfax learned that Russian representatives insisted that 
an inter-governmental agreement on the basing of the Russian 
part of the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea [sentence as received]. 
The Ukrainian delegation wanted to sign a memorandum with the 
same title. 
  Moscow has insisted that Sevastopol be the main base of the 
Russian Navy and that the Ukrainian fleet be based beyond the 
city limits. It can be stationed in Balaklava (Crimea) or in 
Odessa. Russia recognizes that Sevastopol is a Ukrainian city 
under jurisdiction of Ukraine. 
  Sources in the Ukrainian delegation told Interfax that the 
joint expert group was trying to combine the versions and to 
create a single final document which would provide for the 
basing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol and for the 
basing of the Ukrainian Navy in Balaklava and partially in 
Sevastopol. 
  The final document is expected to be signed on May 24 
evening. 
  Earlier today, sources in the Russian delegation had told 
Interfax that Ukraine stood for division of the fleet ships in 
accordance with the March agreements between the Russian and 
Ukrainian presidents. However, Ukraine insisted that it keep 
coastal facilities and infrastructure, including dwelling places 
for marine servicemen which did not conform with the position of 
the Russian delegation.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 24 May TASS -- The separate fleet basing 
issue provoked heated debates at today's Russian-Ukrainian 
negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet. 
  The naval base in the Balaklava Bay is included in the 
Sevastopol megapolis. Russia opposed the use of the "Sevastopol 
city" notion as regards the Ukrainian naval base in Balaklava in 
the joint document. On mutual agreement Sevastopol will remain 
the major base of the Russian fleet. 
  The document provides for another base of the Ukrainian Navy 
in Donuzlava, the Crimea, to house the Ukrainian part of the 
Black Sea Fleet. 
  In the opinion of the Russian side, the use of the 
"Sevastopol" name as regards the Balaklava base runs counter to 
the principle of separate fleet basing envisaged by the 
agreement on gradual division of the Black Sea Fleet. The 
latter was signed by the Russian and Ukrainian presidents on 
April 15, 1994. Thus, the name of the final document has not 
been coordinated. 
  The quantity division of the Black Sea Fleet ships is almost 
not debated. Ukraine will have 164 ships (18 per cent), and the 
Russian Federation -- 669. At the same time, lists of the ships 
are still to be made. 
  The Russian side has suggested to begin the first stage of 
the fleet division after the document signing on condition that 
Sevastopol is considered the chief base of the Russian Black Sea 
Fleet.

  [Text] Talks were held today in Moscow on the Black Sea 
Fleet. It was expected that a final document would be signed by 
the heads of the governments of Russia on the dividing up of the 
fleet, however the issue of dividing up the infrastructure 
remains unresolved. As reported by ITAR-TASS, it is a question 
of coastal fortifications, artillery and depot premises, and 
even of servicemen's flats in Sevastopol. Thus, Chernomyrdin 
and Zvyahilskyy could not sign any kind of final document. 
  The Black Sea Fleet is independent and is capable of 
rebuffing any provocation relating to it. Any unilateral 
actions with regard to the fleet are unlawful. This was stated 
today by Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. He stressed 
that Russia is not indifferent to the situation in Crimea and, 
if that area becomes entangled in a military conflict, it could 
lead to civil war.

  [Text] Moscow, 24 May -- Talks between the heads of 
government of Russia and Ukraine on settling the problems of the 
Black Sea Fleet have been adjourned until tomorrow. A decision 
to do so was taken late this evening by members of the 
delegations of the two countries. 
  The sides were unable to reach agreement on a number of 
points while working out an intergovernmental document dividing 
the Black Sea Fleet. 
  The talks will be continued tomorrow with the same people 
taking part. 
  Valeriy Shmarov, deputy prime minister of Ukraine, told 
journalists that the positions of the sides undoubtedly came 
closer together during today's talks, but there are still a 
great many unresolved problems. At the same time he confirmed 
the desire of the Ukrainian side to reach an agreement.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev believes that 
the Black Sea Fleet is capable of resisting any provocations 
against it. He stressed in an exclusive interview with Interfax 
in Brussels today that the Black Sea Fleet was subordinate to 
the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. This to say that any 
unilateral actions towards the fleet are illegal, he pointed out. 
  Grachev said that Black Sea Fleet Commander, Admiral Eduard 
Baltin was right when taking preventive measures and 
strengthening defense of military facilities within the context 
of the present situation in Crimea. 
  Commenting on movements by Ukrainian military formations in 
Crimea, Grachev called this an attempt to exercise military and 
psychological pressure on the Crimean leadership. This 
represents no military threat. Ukrainian formations are acting 
separately, he emphasized. 
  Grachev suggested that this was done in accordance with 
orders of the Kiev leaders. However, he was sure that Ukraine 
would not declare war on Crimea since it was a civilized state. 
  On 23 May Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk had discussed the situation in Crimea 
on the phone. They had unanimously agreed that the situation in 
Crimea was Ukraine's internal affair. 
  However, Grachev stressed that Russia could not overlook the 
situation in Crimea. "If an armed conflict starts in this 
region, it may lead to a civil war between eastern and western 
Ukraine," Grachev suggested. 
  He emphasized that the presidents had concluded that the 
situation must be settled by peace political means and 
negotiations.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 0725 GMT on 22 May 1994 broadcasts the 30-minute "De 
Facto" program. Correspondent Oleg Vakulovskiy explains that 
the May edition of "De Facto" was to have included an item about 
the Black Sea Fleet, and a camera team was sent to Sevastopol. 
In the light of recent events it was decided to devote the 
entire program to the subject of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  In his introductory remarks, Vakulovskiy says that the Black 
Sea Fleet has always been Russian or Soviet. Its warships are 
currently flying the red flag, even though the Soviet Union no 
longer exists. 
  This expedient has been adopted because the fleet is now 
under the command of two presidents pending its division. 
Vakulovskiy points out that such a division, however desirable, 
will be very difficult. The Black Sea Fleet and the city of 
Sevastopol have been in a unique position for a long time, he 
says. No other fleet has ever been commanded by two presidents. 
No other port has ever hosted two navies. Both sailors and 
warships are suffering, Vakulovskiy says. He recalls that the 
Black Sea Fleet had scuttled itself twice before, in September 
1854 and in June 1918, and says it seems likely that history 
will repeat itself in the 1990s. Vakulovskiy interviews Captain 
Valeriy Zubkov, the commander of the antisubmarine warfare, ASW, 
escort ship Smetlivyy: 
  He asks: "What is the job of your ship?" 
  Zubkov says: "The main function of this ship is to seek out 
and destroy submarines and to protect naval formations." 
  Vakulovskiy then asks: "Is your ship the only one needing 
repair at the moment?" 
  Zubkov replies: "No, the ship is not the only one needing 
repair, but she is the only ship on which repairs are currently 
being carried out. In fact, the repairs are in full swing and 
nearing completion. Dockside testing is under way at the 
moment. The ship is preparing for sea trials. I hope that this 
will be completed in the near future. 
  Vakulovskiy asks: "Why has she been under repair for eight 
years? Is this normal?" 
  Zubkov says: "No, it is not normal for a warship to spend so 
long at the yard. Because of the collapse of the Union, 
probably, the target time for completion has been postponed four 
times. The fleet is aging -- dying, basically. If things carry 
on like this, there will probably be nothing to share out in a 
year's time. Almost 60-70 percent of the ships we now have, have 
had the interval between overhauls extended. These problems are 
not being tackled. Even keeping the ships in dock is a problem. 
A number of ships that are supposed to be under repair are 
stuck here. 
  But it is bad for the crews too. Even those ships that are 
capable of putting to sea, do so less often. The crews are, 
naturally, becoming rusty. Training in port cannot take the 
place of practical work at sea." 
  After interviewing Lena Kolomiytseva, a local radio 
journalist who witnessed last month's seizure of premises 
belonging to the 318th reserve division of the Black Sea Fleet, 
Vakulovskiy interviews Zubkov about strategic changes taking 
place in the Black Sea. Zubkov says: 
  "Ships are putting to sea much less often. Above all, 
warships are virtually unable to meet the objectives of combat 
service. No vessels are on duty in the Mediterranean at the 
moment. Naturally this affects the readiness of crews and the 
skills of warship commanders. Here too trips to sea have been 
substantially curtailed. This also affects crew training 
levels." 
  Vakulovskiy adds that ships were putting to sea only rarely. 
If they did leave port, it was not for months as before but for 
a few days, in order to save fuel. Capt. Zubkov goes on: 
  "Any vacuum will be quickly filled. Warships of allied 
navies, of the United States, used not to enter the Black Sea. 
But last year a NATO naval squadron of nine warships sailed 
into the Black Sea. Inexorably, NATO warships are taking over 
the Black Sea theater. Turkey is also filling this vacuum by 
developing and improving its Navy, by deploying new warships, 
new types of weaponry." 
  Vakulovskiy recalls that a few years ago a warship of the 
Black Sea Fleet, "Bezzavetnyy," rammed an American missile 
cruiser, the "Yorktown," which had entered Soviet territorial 
waters and refused to leave, even after a warning. In those 
days the very fact of a violation of territorial waters was an 
extraordinary occurrence. There were few U.S. vessels in the 
Black Sea then. Now there are far more. Igor Korsakov, an 
analyst employed by the Black Sea Fleet, adds: 
  "Because of the geopolitical changes that have taken place 
in 
the world in recent years, following the collapse of the CIS [as 
heard], Turkey's policy in the world as a whole and its regional 
policy in particular has, naturally, changed. Turkey used to be 
a counterweight, in many respects, to Russia or the Soviet 
Union. Now Turkish policy is to expand its influence on many 
countries of the Black Sea, including those on the southern 
border of the CIS. 
  Vakulovskiy asks: "Which countries?" 
  Korsakov says: "Romania, Bulgaria, Georgia, and 
Turkic-speaking countries of the CIS." 
  Vakulovskiy says: "Azerbaijan?" 
  Korsakov replies: "Yes, Azerbaijan. The Turkish Navy now 
consists of about 200 warships, including 17 diesel submarines, 
12 destroyers including two guided missile destroyers, four 
frigates including two guided missile frigates, 41 assault 
craft, 33 minesweepers, and a large number of large and small 
patrol boats, including those designed for minesweeping. NATO 
experts say that in the very near future the Turkish Navy will 
be a match for Russia's Black Sea Fleet on the Black Sea." 
  Vakulovskiy asks: "What is your expert assessment -- that 
was a NATO assessment." 
  Korsakov says: "I cannot divulge these assessments." 
  Vakulovskiy then asks: "But in your own personal view, are 
the NATO experts close to the truth?" 
  Korsakov replies: "I think they are very close to the truth. 
In the next few years Turkey will become an even stronger naval 
power." 
  Offering his views on the decline of the fleet, Admiral 
Aleksey Kalinin, former commander of the Black Sea Fleet, says: 
  "When I handed over the fleet in 1985, the ratio of strength 
between us and our closest neighbor, Turkey, was about 2.5 to 1 
or even 3 to 1. In 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, it 
was 2 to 1. Now, after two years of confusion and chaos, this 
screw-up, it has fallen to 1:1. This ratio will continue to 
deteriorate, I am afraid, if things go on this way." 
  Kalinin concludes his contribution by saying: "For more than 
two years I have been saying -- both in the press and at various 
meetings, reporting to both presidents and to delegation leaders 
-- that there can be only one solution to this problem. This 
solution is very simple. Since they have declared themselves to 
be independent states, Russia and Ukraine should conclude a 
treaty on an all-embracing alliance. This treaty should 
stipulate that there will be a single maritime defense area in 
the south for which the Black Sea Fleet is responsible. It must 
be preserved." 
  The program is illustrated by extensive footage of warships, 
in varying states of repair or disrepair, in port at Sevastopol 
or leaving port. Some of the vessels shown are rusting hulks or 
wrecks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev by </F>
Sergey Dorenko en route to Brussels on 24 May; from the 
"Details" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Dorenko] The Details camera is on board a 
specially-equipped plane bound for Brussels. We have 
interrupted Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev at his papers 
three hours before his speech at NATO to ask him to comment on 
his tactics with regard to a rapprochement with NATO, 
exclusively for the viewers of the Details. 
  [Grachev] What Russia could gain by this is the following: 
First, confirming to the international community our 
contemporary views on security and our adherence to the policy 
of strengthening our strategic union with the West; second, that 
this would make it potentially possible for us to obtain more 
information about NATO's military-political intentions, plans, 
and actions, as well as other states involved in the Partnership 
for Peace, and to influence them in our interests to a certain 
extent. 
  [Dorenko] But will they not turn us into their southern 
flank? These kinds of worries have been voiced in the press: 
that they will make us fight against the Islamic 
Fundamentalism, and if relations with China become aggravated.... 
  [Grachev, interrupting] I understand your question. You are 
trying to find out what negative implications our cooperation 
may have. No, though theoretically perhaps we will be attached 
to NATO in some way. Our state is a superpower with enormous 
economic and military potential, and of course we will not tow 
NATO's line, act as they tell us to, and take an extreme stance 
on anything. No, in fact, the program we will propose for 
signing will spell all of this out. If it becomes necessary for 
Russia and some NATO countries to take some collective actions, 
that decision should be made collectively, on the basis of 
suggestions and deliberations. Only should an unequivocal 
decision be made, which should be beneficial to Russia and the 
NATO countries. That would be a fair decision. 
  [Dorenko] A question from daily life: In old times, the USSR 
defense minister was chief of staff of the Warsaw Treaty and not 
the United States the NATO leader. Now they will turn out to be 
your commanders. 
  [Grachev] Well, that is a question of secondary importance. 
Actually, no, this will not be so. 
  [Dorenko] What if Ukraine completes its transition to the 
partnership faster than Russia, and, if the conflict with 
Ukraine becomes more acute, NATO turns out to be on the 
Ukrainian side? 
  [Grachev] If Ukraine joins this partnership before us and if 
the NATO countries attempt, together with Ukraine, to put 
pressure on us--well, this cannot be serious, and these states 
will not take such a step for political reasons. This is the 
first point; and second, why should they put pressure us? Are 
we threatening Ukraine, or do we have some extremely tense 
relations with Ukraine? 
  [Dorenko] This happens occasionally. 
  [Grachev] Well, you know, that is what strategy is for. We 
have to resolve all misunderstandings and conflicts by political 
means.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev believes that 
currently there exists no direct military threat to Russia. 
Interfax learned that this statement had been included in his 
draft statement at the NATO Council of Defense Ministers in 
Brussels on Tuesday. Grachev will speak on the Russian military 
doctrine before the participants in the council late on May 24. 
  In accordance with the text of the statement, Russia regards 
no state as its enemy. "Russia has no enemies but it has its 
vital interests. We are ready to defend them and we are capable 
of doing this," the statement underlined. 
  Grachev considered the development of bilateral and 
multilateral agreements between the states and the participation 
of Russia in joint security structures as priorities in the 
sphere of security for Russia. 
  Grachev called stability in the regions close to its borders 
as a prior condition for Russia's military security. "In all 
that concerns the maintenance of international peace and 
security Russia sees all states, the policy of which does no 
damage to its interests, as its partners," the statement 
emphasized. 
  Grachev stressed that development of cooperation with the 
CIS 
states with which it had signed the treaty on joint security 
also was among Russia's priorities. He added that at the 
regional level Russia was prepared to enhance cooperation with 
all CSCE states. 
  Russia does not intend to limit itself to Europe, Grachev 
pointed out. "In order to ensure security for our vitally 
important interests we are obliged to take measures for the 
establishment of a joint security system, including the 
Asian-Pacific region." 
  Grachev underlined that the Russian armed forces had also 
faced several untraditional tasks. They will: 
  -- carry out peacekeeping operations in accordance with the 
decisions by the UN Security Council and other joint security; 
  -- cooperate with the Russian Interior Ministry forces and 
law enforcement bodies in order to localize conflict zones and 
to prevent armed clashes. 
  Commenting on the decision of the Russian leadership which 
had decided not to confirm the obligations assumed by the former 
USSR which said it would not be the first to use nuclear 
weapons, Grachev stated that this did not mean that Russia would 
subscribe to the concept of preventing nuclear strike. Russia 
wants to eliminate the danger of a nuclear war by halting 
aggression against Russia and its allies, Grachev stressed. 
  CIS and Eastern Europe defense ministers will also 
participate in the meeting in Brussels.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Brussels 24 May -- "The aim of the Russian nuclear 
policy is to eliminate the threat of nuclear war by preventing 
an aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies," 
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev told NATO leaders and 
defence ministers today in a report on major provisions of the 
Russian military doctrine. 
  In his words, Russia considers nuclear arms as a means of 
deterrence and not combat operations. The Russian Federation 
was not the first to confirm the Soviet obligation of non-use of 
nuclear arms, but this does not mean a transition to the concept 
of preventive uses of nuclear arms. It shows the Russian 
determination to prevent a large-scale war against the Russian 
Federation and its allies. 
  The minister refuted claims that russia can be the first to 
use nuclear arms even in a limited conflict. The minister said 
that the Russian Federation is striving to cut the nuclear force 
to minimum that would guarantee strategic stability, and fully 
eliminate these arms in future. 
  "The political fundamentals of the Russian military doctrine 
reflect two interrelated tasks -- prevention of a war and 
readiness to repulse an aggressor," said the minister. 
  In his words, Russia rejects any war, the use of military 
force or a threat of its use as a means to achieve political, 
economic or other goals. It stands for the obligation of all 
states not to be the first to use military force. All 
disputable issues must be settled only with political and 
diplomatic means, stressed the Russian minister. 
  "Russia proceeds from the fact that a possibility of local 
and regional wars, as well as armed conflicts in specific states 
because of nationalistic, ethnic, territorial, religious and 
other contradictions remains," said the Russian minister. 
  In his opinion, the increase of aggressive nationalism in 
various areas of the world is the most dangerous challenge to 
regional and international stability. 
  The Russian Federation plans active interaction with the 
commonwealth states in collective defence and security, 
coordination of military policy and defence building. This area 
of cooperation is a priority of Russia, he said. 
  The Russian military doctrine confirms a possibility of 
Russian participation in peace-making operations held on 
decision of the United Nations Security Council. Russian 
security may also require the location of troops and technical 
means outside the Russian Federation. 
  Russia considers all states, whose policy does not affect 
its 
interests and does not run counter to the U.N. charter, its 
partners in provision of peace and consolidation of 
international security.

  [Excerpts] Yet another extremely important subject today is 
the NATO defense ministers conference in Brussels. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent K. Mazheyka] At this moment, as you are 
watching this report, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who 
arrived in Brussels an hour ago, is setting out our conception 
of partnership. 
  [Begin Grachev recording] I have simply brought Russia's 
vision of the Partnership for Peace. The first section is 
political partnership. The second section is military 
partnership, and the third section is a miscellaneous one. 
These are the specifically worked out parameters of our 
partnership. We shall propose that our representatives and the 
special representatives of the NATO countries draw up a 
broad-scale agreement. When it is ready, we will sign two 
documents: a general conception of the partnership and the 
agreement that will be drawn up if the NATO members accept it.

Vladimir Smelov] 
  [Text] Brussels, 25 May -- The reaction of the U.S. defense 
secretary to the Russian concept of wider cooperation with NATO 
was "noncommittal," Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told 
ITAR-TASS after meeting his U.S. counterpart William Perry at 
the NATO Headquarters. 
  "It seems, the Russian minister added, that this is linked 
to 
the fact that the American side is not yet familiar with the 
main parameters of our proposals on this. They will be handed 
over to NATO's acting secretary general today." 
  In P. Grachev's words, the meeting which lasted for over an 
hour discussed primarily issues of bilateral interaction. "Our 
cooperation is growing stronger by the day and we are finding 
more and more mutual understanding," he stressed.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Russian Defense Minister Visits NATO </F>
Headquarters"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 24 May -- Today's visit to Brussels by 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev goes beyond the framework 
of "protocol" visits at this level. The meetings with the 
Russian minister are expected to produce above all a 
clarification of the prospects for the development of relations 
between Russia and NATO, and, consequently, a plan for a future 
European security system. 
  Under a program announced around a month ago, P. Grachev 
will 
familiarize the heads of the alliance's military departments 
with the main provisions of Russia's defense doctrine, including 
the issues -- of concern to the West -- of the use of nuclear 
weapons, and the place occupied by the former Soviet republics 
in Moscow's strategy. But the delay in Russia's planned April 
accession to the "Partnership for Peace" program proposed by 
NATO leaders, and contradictory statements in Moscow and 
Brussels have put this aspect of the visit at the center of 
attention. 
  P. Grachev will set out Russia's corresponding position at a 
meeting with the NATO leadership and at a North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council (NACC) defense ministers' session 25 May. 
  Everyone in NATO agrees that a nuclear power with a major 
economic and military potential should play a special part in an 
international security system. But they do not want to formally 
enshrine this in the program's framework document, which has 
already been signed by 18 other countries apart from the 
alliance members, including eight former USSR republics. The 
framework document, NATO leaders say, is a kind of "letter of 
intent" that does not carry any obligations. It is planned to 
cooperate under an individual program -- that is, on a bilateral 
basis. Here too Russia's special status will be established by 
itself. But if Russia does not join the program, it will be 
hard for it to influence the formation and workings of this 
mechanism, and then a new barrier could arise in Europe -- on 
the Russian border. 
  During his official visit to Belgium 26-27 May the Russian 
minister will hold talks with his Belgian colleague Leo 
Delcroix, who, we have learned, incidentally, was the initiator 
of the meeting between the 15 NATO defense ministers and P. 
Grachev. The Russian guest will visit a small-arms plant, an 
air base, and the Ostend Naval Base, and will fly by helicopter 
around Flanders and its ports of Antwerp, Ghent, and Zeebrugge.

  [Text] Brussels, 25 May -- The Russian side today submitted 
to NATO a document containing the main parameters of Russian 
participation in the implementation of the Partnership for Peace 
program. At the same time it was proposed to start drawing up a 
broad program of cooperation between Russia and NATO that would 
be based on these parameters and to sign the outline document as 
soon as this program is ready. 
  In the political sphere, Russia proposes the creation of an 
effective mechanism of mutual consultations on the entire range 
of problems of European and world security, which would operate 
both on a regular basis and in emergencies. Such a mechanism 
would be a practical step on the way to the formation of a 
long-term system of collective security and stability in Europe 
under the aegis of the CSCE. In the military sphere, Russia is 
ready to develop cooperation with NATO and partners in such 
areas as coordinating joint military activities, peace-keeping, 
transparency in military planning and military activities, and 
personnel training. It also expects to establish partnership 
relations in other areas, such as disarmament and arms control, 
conversion, nonproliferation of mass destruction weapons, and 
protection of the environment.

  [Text] Moscow is to hold talks with the Paris Club of 
creditor states of the former USSR on the deferment of payments 
to service Russia's foreign debt this year at the beginning of 
June. 
  In a letter to the chairman of the Paris Club May 24, 
Russian 
Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin agreed on behalf of Russia 
to hold the talks on rescheduling Russian foreign debt in Paris 
on June 2-3. The minister told a press conference the same day 
that Moscow was prepared to pay 4.1 billion dollars (the sum set 
aside by the draft federal budget) in 1994 towards servicing the 
debt. 
  Shokhin stressed that Russia was concerned above all about 
the servicing of the Russian debt (which accounted for around 10 
pct of the 80 billion dollar debt). He said that the "creditors 
of the former USSR had to view the situation realistically and 
be patient for the time being." 
  Shokhin stressed that the repayment of the debts to members 
of the Paris Club depended largely on the position of Italy. 
Moscow and Rome, he said, had not yet been able to agree the 
terms for repaying Italian loans from 1993. 
  As far as the London Club (which incorporates western banks 
to which Russia owes money), Shokhin said that talks were 
continuing. However, he admitted that no firm decisions had yet 
been made regarding that part of the foreign debt. 
  President Yeltsin's senior economic adviser Alexander 
Livshitz has reported that the first package of 6 presidential 
economic decrees issued on May 23 may be extended to other 
documents. 
  Speaking at an economic reform congress in Moscow on 
Tuesday, 
he suggested that new decrees may touch upon foreign investment, 
social security, and bankruptcy legislation. 
  By some evidence, up to 30 such presidential decrees are to 
be issued by the end of this year. 
  At the same time, Lifshitz voiced confidence that for 
furthering economic reforms, such documents should be worked out 
in a civilized way through the Duma and other representative 
bodies. 
  "The presidential administration hopes that next steps to 
adopt necessary economic laws will be taken by Duma members 
themselves," Livshitz said.

report has only proved the point. 
  The U.S. government's private investment corporation has 
started a search for Far Eastern regions that are most promising 
in terms of investment. Yesterday, the Americans visited the 
free economic zone at Nakhodka, where they examined its ports 
and enterprises. 
  The U.S. mission will also visit Khabarovsk Kray, Sakhalin, 
and Kamchatka. After the tour, the mission chief, U.S. Senator 
Ruth Harkin, said they will give recommendations to her 
country's entrepreneurs as to which regions of the Russian Far 
East are best for investment. She called Nakhodka one of Russia 
's most promising areas at this stage.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>
  [Text] Hiroshima May 25 TASS -- Russia cannot agree with a 
recent U.S. proposal on an international control system, which 
will be necessary if an international agreement on stopping 
nuclear arms tests is concluded, ITAR-TASS learned on Wednesday 
[25 May] from reliable Russian sources participating now in the 
U.N. disarmament conference in the Japanese city of Hiroshima. 
  The multilateral talks to conclude an international 
agreement 
on stopping nuclear tests which started in Geneva last January, 
centre on a system of control. 
  According to the above sources, the American side recently 
offered its own model of control which presupposes the 
simultaneous application of six verification systems and the 
establishment of appropriate global structures. 
  Russian experts believe that it will take at least ten years 
to implement the U.S.-brokered model. Besides, it presupposes 
huge financial outlays, which is objected not only by Russia, 
but also by other nuclear powers. 
  In contrast to Washington, Moscow believes that the 
application of two systems -- seismic and atmospheric control -- 
is quite sufficient. According to these sources, this viewpoint 
is backed by many participants in the nuclear tests talks in 
Geneva, including Japan. 
  The U.S. proposal, the official reply to which Moscow plans 
to give in the next few days, puts in jeopardy, as the sources 
stressed, the chance of the timely signing of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty which expires next year. 
  This is explained by the fact that most treaty participants, 
members of the Non-Aligned Movement in the main, insist that the 
nuclear powers should conclude an agreement on stopping nuclear 
tests. They agree to prolong the treaty for unlimited duration 
only under this condition.

  [Text] The arbitration court in Moscow has cancelled a 
license issued to the Russian-U.S. oil venture calling itself 
White Nights, well-informed sources told INTERFAX. The company 
was expected to develop a new oil field in Tyumen region. 
  White Nights is the first oil producing venture formed by 
Russia's Varyeganneftegaz and two U.S. companies -- Anglo-Suisse 
and Fibro Energy -- in November 1990. Since then, the company 
produced a total of 2.4 million [metric] tonnes of crude oil 
from its Zapadno-Varyeganskii oil field. The project cost 53.7 
billion rubles to implement. White Nights also has licenses for 
the development of Tagrin and Roslavl oil fields of Western 
Siberia. 
  The suit against the Russian Committee for Natural Resources 
(Goskomnedr) and the administration of the Khanty Mansy 
autonomous region was brought by a public group, Tayezhnik 
(uniting several local clans) which owns part of the land where 
the company operates. 
  The plaintiff on Monday challenged the legitimacy of the 
company's license which was negotiated rather than won at a 
tender. This is in breach of the federal law on mineral 
resources adopted in February 1992.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Krupenik] </F>
  [Text] St. Petersburg May 23 TASS -- "Russia is far from 
looking for momentary profits on the market of uranium raw 
materials and concentration technologies as it is adhering to 
the strategy of mutually beneficial cooperation and partnership. 
We are prepared to work out jointly such quotas and prices 
which would not infringe on the interests of any national 
companies," Professor Viktor Mikhaylov, minister of atomic 
energy of the Russian Federation, stated speaking at the 21st 
conference "World Market of Nuclear Fuel" which opened in St. 
Petersburg today. 
  Taking part in this regular quorum of the international 
organization which is being held for the first time in Russia, 
are 200 experts from 20 countries representing power engineering 
companies, and enterprises producing uranium products and 
nuclear fuel. 
  The Russian minister drew attention of participants of the 
conference to the generally recognized fact that the Russian 
industry possessed the sufficient potential for extraction of 
uranium raw materials and its dressing. According to Viktor 
Mikhaylov, capacities of these enterprises are even slightly 
bigger than those of the United States, and they are much 
superior to the possibilities of European plants. 
  At the same time the Russian minister refuted an erroneous 
viewpoint that the agreement and the contract between Russia and 
the United States on the utilization of 500 tons of highly 
enriched uranium which within the framework of the disarmament 
program is extracted and processed by Russian specialists, and 
then delivered to Americans for selling under national 
contracts, are capable somehow of affecting the world market 
balance. The agreement stipulates specifically that the 
delivered volumes of uranium should be strictly compensated by 
the corresponding reduction of American diffusive enterprises' 
capacities and do not deform the market, the Russian minister of 
atomic power stressed. 
  Participants of the St. Petersburg forum "World Market of 
Nuclear Fuel" which will work for two days, are discussing 
problems of reforming the nuclear power industry on a world 
scale with due consideration for the development of atomic power 
stations in countries of Europe and the south-east Asia, and 
Russia's appearance on world markets of uranium fuel.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>
  [Text] Hiroshima 24 May TASS -- Completely stopping nuclear 
tests, production of fissionable materials for military 
purposes, and enhancing in every possible way an international 
dialogue on strategical stability have now become top priority 
tasks for nuclear powers, Chief of the Analysis and Prognosis 
Department in the Russian Foreign Ministry Ednan Agayev said at 
the U.N. disarmament conference, which opened in the Japanese 
city of Hiroshima today. 
  Agayev noted that now the nuclear restraining philosophy 
does 
not serve as a factor greatly influencing interrelations between 
Russia and the United States, and expressed the opinion that 
largest nuclear powers are now gradually reconsidering their 
concepts of nuclear restraint. In particular, it is testified 
by the fact that they are adhering to the moratorium on nuclear 
tests, which was until now considered to be an indispensible 
part of the nuclear strategy, he added. "It would be naive to 
think that international negotiations on banning nuclear tests 
within the conference on disarmament framework, which are 
underway in Geneva, will move ahead easily and speedily," the 
high-ranking Russian Foreign Ministry official noted. "But the 
rejection of nuclear tests by all states will, undoubtedly, help 
successfully holding them," he said. 
  Agayev said that limiting and stopping production of 
fissionable materials for military purposes is one of the most 
important efforts made in this direction by nuclear powers. 
"The fulfillment of this task could become a reality, if 
nuclear powers would look at their nuclear arsenals as an 
attribute of history and actively seek for their reduction," he 
said. 
  Touching upon the problem of international security under 
conditions of a gradual reduction in nuclear weapons, the 
Russian official emphasised the importance of the dialogue on 
strategical stability which Russia is continuing currently not 
only with the United States and other nuclear powers, but also 
with such countries as Germany and Japan. Consultations on 
security with the participation of military and intelligence 
departments' representatives might help strengthen mutual trust 
and expedite cuts in nuclear arsenals, he added. 
  "The dialogue on strategical stability helps elicit ideas 
which might form the basis of a new concept of security that is 
called on to replace nuclear restraint," the Russian diplomat 
noted.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow May 24 TASS -- Cases of recruiting Russian 
citizens for participation in combat operations in a number of 
hot spots in the former Soviet Union have become more frequent, 
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin told a 
briefing here today. Recruiters from the Caucasian republics 
are particularly active in this business, he noted. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry has lodged a vigorous protest 
against illegal actions by persons recruiting mercenaries on the 
Russian territory, Grigoriy Karasin stressed. The Russian 
diplomat noted that "in accordance with international law, 
recruiting, deploying, financing and training of mercenaries is 
a grave crime. Such actions run counter to a friendly character 
of relations among states and cannot be regarded otherwise than 
doing them a serious damage. In accordance with international 
commitments and the existing legislation the Russian side is 
reserving the right to take all necessary measures to put an end 
to such actions by the law enforcement bodies". 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry urged Russian citizens who have 
already become or intend to become "soldiers of fortune" to 
think better of it and give up such plans, and return to 
peaceful life. 
  The Russian Foreign Office also appealed to all countries, 
first of all to members of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States, to take efficient measures to eliminate recruiting 
activities, including recruiting Russian citizens as mercenaries. 
  "Taking into account the fact that the problem of 
recruitment 
goes beyond national borders and can be resolved only on the 
basis of consolidation of efforts of all states, we are 
expressing our readiness to hold consultations on practical 
aspects of the struggle against this dangerous phenomenon both 
within the framework of the Commonwealth and at a bilateral 
level," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Kovalev report under the "Events and Commentaries" </F>
rubric: "Russia-Belorussia [Belarus]: Work on Agreement in 
Military Sphere Concluded. Another Round of Talks Between the 
Russian and Belorussian Delegations on Issues of Military 
Cooperation Has Been Held in Minsk"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- At the request of your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
correspondent, Veniamin Popov, leader of the Russian delegation 
and ambassador at large, commented on the results of the talks. 
  "During the latest meeting," the Russian diplomat said, "we 
worked on preparing the texts of four agreements. Two of them 
deal with the future operation of strategic installations 
located on Belorussian [Belarusian] territory. These are the 
naval radio station at Vileyka, which ensures communications 
with the ships of the Russian Fleet, and the missile 
early-warning radar station near the city of Baranovichi. The 
third agreement will regulate issues connected with financing 
the group of Russian forces stationed in Belorussia. The fourth 
agreement will determine a procedure for allowing Belorussian 
air defense troops to use our missile firing ranges to carry out 
combat firing exercises. 
  "In my view, the talks went well, and were held in an 
atmosphere of mutual understanding and accord. Consequently we 
directly proceeded to initial all four agreements. All that 
remains is to to clarify one or two details. This will be done 
during our upcoming meeting in Moscow at the beginning of June, 
after which we will be able to submit the documents for signing 
by the leaders of our states' governments." 
  The head of the Russian delegation stressed that the success 
of the talks that have just taken place was decisively 
predetermined by the Treaty on the Unification of Russia's and 
Belorussia's Monetary Systems signed 12 April in Moscow. This 
raised a number of questions which it would not have been easy 
to resolve had this treaty not existed. 
  So what is the upshot? Following the signing of the 
agreements that have been worked through, Russia will get the 
chance to use the radio station in Vileyka even after its 
strategic troops have been withdrawn from Belorussia. 
Construction of the radar station near Baranovichi will be 
completed. This installation will also remain on Belorussian 
territory after the year 2000. It will operate not just in 
Russia's interests, but in the interests of all CIS countries 
that are party to the Collective Security Treaty, and that 
includes Belorussia. For their part, Belorussian missile troops 
will be able to carry out combat firing practice at Russian 
military firing ranges. They intend to take advantage of this 
opportunity as early as this summer.

  [Text] Moscow, 24 May (ITAR-TASS) -- "We will not withdraw 
our troops from Estonia until the issue of the retired 
servicemen is resolved in a civilized fashion," Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today before flying to Tallinn. He 
was going to Estonia to take part in a ministerial session of 
the Council of Baltic Sea States. The Russian minister also 
intends holding a series of meetings with Estonian leaders. 
  According to the Russian foreign minister, discussion of the 
Tartu treaty [signed by Estonia and Russia in 1920, dealing with 
territorial issues] is pointless. "We do not intend to discuss 
any territorial claims," the minister noted. 
  Touching on the situation in Crimea, A. Kozyrev stressed 
that 
the main thing now is to refrain from using force. Talks 
between Russia and Ukraine on this issue are continuing at this 
time.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov </F>
and Albert Maloveryan] 
  [Text] Tallinn 25 May -- An appeal of military pensioners 
to dwell on the Estonian discriminative policy on military 
pensioners was passed over by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev to his Estonian counterpart Uri Luik, who chaired a 
session of ministers from the Council of Baltic Sea States. 
  Speaking at the forum, the Russian official stressed the 
council's role in organization of regional cooperation. He 
called for the consolidation of the council and specification of 
its activities. 
  The session is expected to elect the council's commissioner 
for human rights and ethnic minorities. Russia is ready to help 
him and his staffers in fulfilment of their duties on Russian 
territory. Andrey Kozyrev hopes that the commissioner will help 
settle some Russian-Estonian problems. 
  The Russian delegation is expected to circulate two 
memoranda 
during the session -- one on human rights and the other on 
economic partnership -- in order to give a fresh impetus to 
cooperation in these spheres. Russia supports the consolidation 
of the council's organizational mechanisms and favors close 
coordination of efforts taken by the council chairman, his 
successor and predecessor. 
  The current session is attended by foreign ministers from 
Germany, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, the Russian 
Federation, Finland, Sweden and Estonia, as well as 
representatives of the Commission of the European Union. The 
agenda includes regional cooperation, ecological and nuclear 
safety in the Baltic Sea area, interaction with states-members 
of the European Union and other regional problems. A joint 
communique will be adopted on the session results.

<F P=106> [Aydyn Mekhtiyev report in the "Settlement" column: </F>
"Russia's Karabakh Policy Does Not Suit the Opposition. 
Statement by 10 Deputies of the Russian Federation State Duma"] 
  [Text] Ten deputies of the Russian Federation State Duma 
have come out with a statement criticizing government policy 
over the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict. 
"Supported by the Russian government and using the conflict 
around Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenian military forces have occupied 
14,000 sq km of Azerbaijan territory, evicting more than half a 
million residents, emerging as the main source of aggression in 
the Caucasus," stresses the document signed by, among others, 
opposition deputies Sergey Baburin, Aleksandr Nevzorov, and 
Anatoliy Lukyanov. 
  The statement maintains that, against the eventuality of the 
Azerbaijan leadership's refusing to approve the Russian peace 
plan, Armenian military formations are preparing an assault on 
the city of Gyandzha while "Armenian military forces are 
incapable of conducting such offensive operations without direct 
support from the Russian Federation Defense Ministry." 
  The authors of the statement believe it necessary in the 
very 
near future to hear at a State Duma session reports by the 
Russian Federation defense and foreign ministers to learn "to 
what extent the policy pursued by them in the zone of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict corresponds to Russia's national 
interests." 
  It is noteworthy that prior to the statement a State Duma 
delegation led by Russian Path deputies' group coordinator 
Sergey Baburin visited Baku where it held negotiations with the 
Azerbaijan government. Although the statement was signed by 
only 10 deputies (mainly representatives of the Russian National 
Union), it can be assumed that communist and agrarian factions 
in the Russian parliament will support the charges made against 
the Chernomyrdin government. The Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia faction will hardly join this statement because Vladimir 
Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy] has repeated accused Azerbaijan of 
infringing Armenians' rights. 
  As for the State Duma committees, they have not as yet 
worked 
out a common approach to the Karabakh problem. State Duma 
Security Committee chairman Viktor Ilyukhin has signed "the 
statement of 10." At the same time the State Duma Committee on 
International Affairs so far tends to support President' 
Yeltsin's policy in the Karabakh conflict. Committee Chairman 
Vladimir Lukin, in the course of recent negotiations with 
Azerbaijan parliament speaker Rasul Guliyev, sought to persuade 
him to accept the peace plan prepared in Smolenskaya Square. 
  As far as concerns talks between Baku and Moscow on terms 
for 
Azerbaijan's accession to the Moscow 17 May protocol, it is so 
far difficult to say that a definite accord will be reached. On 
Saturday in Moscow talks were held behind closed doors between 
Russian Federation and Azerbaijan Defense Ministers Pavel 
Grachev and Mamedraf Mamedov. An informed source in the 
Azerbaijan Defense Ministry told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's 
correspondent that in the course of the meeting Mamedov stated 
that a condition for Azerbaijan's signing the document is the 
inclusion into the text of the protocol of an exact date for 
Armenian troop withdrawal from the occupied territories. Baku 
believes that the Armenian side must start the withdrawal, not 
after both sides pull out their troops from the current front 
line but simultaneously with it. The Russian minister agreed 
with Baku's arguments. The sides agreed to continue 
consultations after Grachev's return from his trip to the NATO 
headquarters in Brussels. 
  The haste with which Russian generals are going to introduce 
peacekeeping forces in Azerbaijan suggests that Moscow is not 
particularly interested in seeing the CSCE Minsk group join the 
peace process. On 16 May Grachev told journalists that the 
Russian defense department will not wait for the arrival in the 
region of international observers but will be acting according 
to its own plan. Such a statement seems to be at odds with the 
accord about coordinating Moscow's and the CSCE's efforts on 
this issue reached between Russian Federation Foreign Affairs 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and head of the CSCE Minsk group Ian 
Iliasson. At the end of last week the U.S. Administration 
warned Moscow indirectly about the impermissibility of 
conducting a peacekeeping operation in Nagorno- Karabakh without 
coordination with the CSCE and the UN. 
  U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan Richard Kauzlarich made the 
following statement in Baku: Any plan for resolving the 
Karabakh problem, including a Russian plan, must be executed 
within the CSCE Minsk group framework... The introduction of 
CIS disengagement forces into the region must proceed under the 
supervision of international observers.

  [Text] Moscow May 24 TASS -- Neither the State Duma nor 
the Federation Council will impede the ratification of the 
treaty between the Russian Federation and the Slovak Republic, 
Federation Council Deputy Chairman Valerian Viktorov told a 
parliamentary delegation from the Slovak Republic during their 
meeting in the Russian parliament today. 
  According to Viktorov, the Russian Foreign Ministry has 
already sent the document to the State Duma, the lower chamber 
of the Russian federal legislature, for consideration. 
  Slovak delegation leader Ivan Laluga said members of the new 
Slovak parliament, which has been functioning for a mere six 
months, are interested primarily in the democratization process 
in Russia and in principles of work of the Federation Council in 
this respect. He said Slovakia is considering the establishment 
of a second chamber in its parliament to better reflect the 
interests of the regions". 
  The sides exchanged views on the activity of legislatures in 
the two countries and expressed confidence that their inter- 
parliamentary ties will continue to strengthen. 
  Responding to questions about relations between the Russian 
Federation and the Chechen Republic, Viktorov stressed that "all 
problems between the federal centre and the Chechen Republic 
must be settled though negotiations". According to him, it is 
far from best to try and solve such problems by force. He said 
the Russian president's intention to meet with the president of 
the Chechen Republic was a positive development.

"Russia: Yes to Balladur Pact"] 
  [Excerpt] Nizhniy Novgorod -- [passage omitted] After 
harvesting the political results he expected from his visit to 
Moscow, the French foreign minister decided to devote the two 
final stages of his first visit to Russia -- Nizhniy Novgorod 
and St. Petersburg -- to remembrance and culture. In 
particular, he officially opened the French Institute in St. 
Petersburg, "the symbol," the minister reaffirmed, "of the 
new-found fraternity between Russia and France." 
  "The aim of my visit was to assert the French Government's 
desire to give full strength to the partnership between our two 
countries. This objective has been achieved," he said after his 
talks with Andrey Kozyrev, his counterpart, President Boris 
Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev. The Russian Government demonstrated a 
degree of caution with regard to the French stances, both on the 
partnership treaty with the European Union and on security in 
Europe. But Alain Juppe was able to clear up the 
misunderstandings. 
  European Partnership [subhead] 
  "We are similar. You like frankness and so do I," a jovial 
Boris Yeltsin, who was in "excellent shape," as the French 
foreign minister was able to observe, told him from the outset. 
Andrey Kozyrev confirmed his presence at the start of the Paris 
meeting [conference on stability in Europe] on 26 and 27 May and 
Russia's pledge to follow the agreements resulting from it. In 
particular, the Russians have given their agreement to the 
principle of a roundtable on Baltic problems. General Grachev 
also presented the French minister with the broad outlines of 
the proposal he is due to unveil to NATO on Tuesday. "France 
endorses the idea of a Partnership for Peace. In view of its 
history and its size, the fact that Russia should hold a special 
place in it goes without saying," Alain Juppe said. In his 
view, Russia should also join the Council of Europe. And 
participate in the work of the G-7, "which one day will become a 
G-8." 
  Discussing the various crises within the CIS with the 
Russian 
defense minister, and especially the conflict between Ukraine 
and Crimea, Alain Juppe stressed that "France understands the 
special role which Russia can play in these regions," but that 
it can only envisage "peacekeeping operations under the auspices 
of an international organization." In the sphere of the 
partnership agreement with the European Union, the obstacle of 
the export of Russian nuclear fuel, which made Paris fear unfair 
competition on this market, is about to disappear. "I hope that 
between now and the meeting of the European Union ministers in 
Corfu, we will have found solutions which make it possible to 
sign this agreement," Alain Juppe said.

to appear before the student body of Bonn University and

  However, as Aleksey Ivanovich [Kazannik] told MOSKOVSKIY

Aleksey Ivanovich believes this is simply political revenge in

  [Text] Helsinki -- The Finnish mass media report that 
exercises designed to eliminate a potential accident at the 
nuclear electric power station in Loviisa, a city on the south 
coast of Finland, were interpreted in Vyborg and St. Petersburg 
as a real disaster and thus caused alarm to the authorities and 
considerable panic among the population. 
  "People in Vyborg," Helsinki newspapers report, "were so 
convinced by these rumors of an accident in Finland that the 
local radio and television advised the population on ways to 
protect themselves against radiation. Residents were urged not 
to go out into the street while people already outside were 
advised to wash their clothing thoroughly." Finnish television 
claims that similar appeals were made in St. Petersburg, too. 
  How could the disaster rumors have developed? The Finnish 
Ministry of Internal Affairs has given the following 
explanation: One of the things that was checked out as part of 
the exercises at the Loviisa nuclear power station was the 
emergency radio communications system, and conversations via 
that system could have been heard in neighboring areas of Russia. 
  The exercises were held last Wednesday [18 May], but the 
Finnish authorities did not learn about the disquiet across the 
border until Friday evening when businessmen arriving from 
Russia bombarded the police with questions about what had 
happened at the Loviisa power station and whether it was safe or 
not to travel on to the west of the country. These reports 
appeared in the press on Saturday. 
  The Finnish authorities, as the local television service 
reported, informed the Russian side that all was calm in 
Loviisa, that nothing had happened there, and that the radiation 
situation in Finland remains normal. Nevertheless, I hope that 
two small conclusions will be drawn from this episode. 
  Conclusion number one: Since the alarm was raised in Vyborg 
and St. Petersburg when the radio conversations at Lovisa were 
intercepted, this means that there is a danger alert system in 
operation there, which can only be good news. 
  Conclusion number two: It would be a good idea if countries 
which hold such exercises were to notify neighboring states in 
good time, especially if they are going to go on air and talk 
about disasters.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Pshenichnikov] </F>
  [Text] Oslo May 25 TASS -- The Norwegian Government has 
recently decided to breathe new life into its waning economic 
relations with Russia. 
  ITAR-TASS has learned from trustworthy diplomatic sources 
that the Norwegian Government has decided to cancel the strict 
rule in trade with Russia, which had been in force so far, 
according to which the Russian Government was required to issue 
like guarantees in reply to Norwegian financial guarantees to 
credits granted for various joint economic ventures. The 
Norwegian cabinet of ministers plans to submit for the 
parliament's endorsement a proposal not to demand any reply 
financial guarantees from Russia. Henceforth, Norwegian 
businessmen will trade with their Russian partners relying only 
on the guarantees provided by their own country. 
  On the initiative of the Foreign Ministry, the norwegian 
Government plans to ask the parliament for permission to 
allocate 500 million krones (almost 68.5 million dollars) to 
guarantee the credits that will be granted by Norwegian 
companies to East European and CIS nations without any reply 
guarantees. Pride of place in this crediting policy is given to 
Russia. Moreover, the cabinet will ask for 100 million krones 
(13.7 million dollars) for the so- called "losses fund". In 
other words, this will be money that one "could lose" if trade 
with unreliable partners. 
  According to various sources, the parliament, most likely, 
will not object to this decision.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Zheglov report: "Moscow Denies Claim of </F>
Recognition for DRY"] 
  [Text] Almost exactly four years after the unification of 
North and South Yemen into a single state, a real threat of a 
split has emerged. At the end of last week 'Ali Salim al-Bid, 
deputy chairman of the Yemen Republic's Presidential Council, 
announced the secession of the south of the country and the 
formation of a new independent state -- the Democratic Republic 
of Yemen [DRY]. Moreover, elections to the Presidential Council 
were held almost immediately in the southern capital of Aden, 
and it is planned to form a government of the republic in the 
very near future. 
  In a statement on this issue, an ITAR-TASS correspondent 
reports, 'Ali Salim al-Bid stressed that the new state is "part 
of the Arab nation and its political system is based on the 
principles of party and political pluralism." The DRY sees its 
main aim as being to restore Yemeni unity on the basis of the 
Document of National Accord and Reconciliation signed 20 
February this year. At the same time, the leader of the 
"Southerners" called on Arab states to recognize the DRY and 
give it every possible assistance. 
  This development of events has forced 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
the leader of the "Northerners," to issue an order to resume the 
offensive on Aden which was suspended for the Muslim feast of 
'Id al-Adha. Bloody battles have again been launched in the 
vicinity of the al-'Anad Air Base, 56 km from the southern 
capital. Judging by everything, the "Northerners" have succeed 
in establishing control over this strategically most important 
installation. Indirect confirmation of that was the statement 
from the "Southerners'" military command to evacuate arms dumps 
and stores of material and technical resources from the region. 
At the same time, there have been reports of the construction 
of defensive fortifications in the suburbs of Aden. 
  Meanwhile, almost a month of fighting has shown that neither 
side has been able to win the strategic initiative. Different 
sources in Sanaa have admitted that the resistance from the 
"Southerners" has been "unexpectedly stubborn." In 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih's opinion, this is also happening because 
"certain countries are continuing to supply arms to Aden." 
  In this connection 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih stated that these 
actions will be seen as blatant interference in the country's 
internal affairs, with all the ensuing consequences. He also 
warned against any attempts to voice support for or to recognize 
the DRY. 
  Strangely enough, there are some stubborn rumors in Sanaa 
that the first state to recognize the independence of South 
Yemen has been Russia. This has forced Russian Foreign Ministry 
representatives to categorically deny these fabrications. 
Viktor Posuvalyuk, director of the Department for Near East and 
North African Countries, stated that Moscow is expressing 
extreme concern about the continuation of hostilities in Yemen 
and is calling for a cease-fire, which would benefit the entire 
Yemeni people.

  [Text] Moscow, 24 May (ITAR-TASS) -- "Russia supports the 
unity and stability of Yemen". The ITAR-TASS correspondent was 
told today by a representative of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs that this was contained in a message 
from the Russian leadership which was conveyed to 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council of the Republic of 
Yemen, yesterday by the Russian ambassador to Yemen. 
  It notes in the message that Russia follows the development 
of events in Yemen attentively and is concerned over the 
continuing military operations and senseless fratricidal 
bloodshed, as a result of which hundreds of people have 
perished. Moscow, the message says, calls for a cease-fire and 
supports the unity of the entire people of Yemen.

Krivoshey and Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Excerpt] Moscow, 24 May -- Russian diplomacy is focusing 
its efforts on resolving the task of bringing closer the 
positions taken by Damascus and Tel Aviv in order to arrive at 
practical accords between them as soon as possible, Grigoriy 
Karasin, the head of the press and information department of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry, said at a briefing today. 
  In his words, Moscow believes the Israeli-Palestinian 
breakthrough does not a priori mean an irreversible turn in the 
direction of a comprehensive and just peace in the region. It 
is obvious that now is the time to resolutely move forward in 
all areas of the Arab-Israeli talks, and particularly with 
regard to Syria, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said. [passage

Vyacheslav Tomilin] 
  [Text] Beijing 25 May TASS -- "The Chinese visit by Russian 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin which will start on Thursday [26 
May] and the second session of the Russian-Chinese 
intergovernment commission on trade, economic, scientific and 
technical cooperation which opens in Beijing on Wednesday, are 
two independent events, but they are closely connected with each 
other," Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin who is also 
co-chairman of the commission, said at the Beijing airport today. 
  "I believe that this coincidence is beneficial for our 
work," 
he said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on his arrival 
in Beijing. "We shall prepare to a great extent the economic 
part of our premier's visit during the commission's work. 
  "We shall actively join the work of the premier's delegation 
tomorrow, taking into account results achieved at the session." 
  The first session of the joint commission was held in Moscow 
in 1992, while the next one was scheduled for last autumn. 
"Regrettably," Shokhin said, "we are late a bit with its holding 
due to political events in Russia. I mean the elections." 
  Turning to the present state of bilateral trade and economic 
relations, he pointed to good results of the past two years: the 
volume of trade turnover achieved even during the best years of 
Soviet-Chinese cooperation, has been topped. 
  At the same time, some drop has been registered of late. In 
the opinion of the vice-premier, this is explained by the fact 
that traditional forms of cooperation have been exhausted. 
  "We plan to discuss new methods of cooperation with our 
Chinese colleagues. I have in mind such mechanisms as access of 
Russian exporters to the Chinese national currency and the right 
of importers to choose commodity suppliers as well as long-term 
investment cooperation. 
  "I believe that, using this forms of cooperation, we shall 
be 
able to bring Russian-Chinese trade and economic relations to a 
new level of development," the vice-premier concluded.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Gorlov article under the "Visits" rubric: "Will </F>
the `Chinese Lantern' Show Us the Right Way? Russian Premier 
Viktor Chernomyrdin Begins Official Visit to PRC 26 May"] 
  [Text] Sino-Russian trade and economic cooperation in 
1992-1993 was fairly dynamic. Last year bilateral trade rose 30 
percent to total $7.7 billion. China was Russia's number two 
trading partner after the FRG. At the same time our country's 
position is more modest in the Chinese "league table" -- it 
comes seventh after Japan, Hong Kong, the United States, the 
FRG, Taiwan, and South Korea. 
  During a recent visit to the PRC by a Russian State Duma 
delegation led by Ivan Rybkin it was noted that by no means full 
use is being made of the potential for broadening bilateral 
ties. The Russian market is still experiencing shortages of food 
and consumer goods, creating the preconditions for increased 
imports from China, particularly to parts of Siberia and the Far 
East. At the same time there is potential for increasing 
exports of Russian machinebuilding output to China (it now 
accounts for around 35 percent of all our exports to the PRC). 
  Early in 1994 Sino-Russian trade was seen to decline. In the 
first quarter it dropped 44 percent compared with the same 
period last year. Specialists think that the reason for the 
slump was that trade predominantly in the form of barter has 
exhausted its potential. A move to more modern forms of 
economic production cooperation is what is needed, with mutual 
capital investment and the creation of joint enterprises. 
  At the moment inadequate use is being made of this potential 
and Russia is, moreover, clearly lagging behind in this field. 
In 1992 300 Chinese missions and joint enterprises were 
registered in our country while in 1993 the figure was around 
500. In China there are just over 400 enterprises involving 
Russian capital. Their contribution ($200 million) to the 
Chinese economy as part of overall foreign investment (last year 
credit and investment agreements were signed worth $110 billion) 
is still a drop in the ocean. 
  Legal, organizational, and financial support from the state 
is needed to change the situation along with the development of 
a market infrastructure -- a transport network, banking system, 
etc. State intervention is needed to restore equivalent 
commodity exchange and monitor the quality of the output 
supplied and contract deadlines. These matters are expected to 
be discussed during Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to China. 
  The second important aspect of the Russian prime minister's 
trip is to study the experience of Chinese reform. Over the 
last 14 years China's economy has developed extremely 
dynamically. In 1992-1993 the PRC was the world leader in terms 
of the pace of economic growth (over 13 percent a year). In 
1993 industrial production rose 21.4 percent, while investment 
in fixed capital was up 50.6 percent. Industrial production is 
rising fastest in the private sector and at enterprises 
involving foreign capital (64.6 percent) as well as at 
enterprises in collective ownership (39.8 percent). 
  The sphere of market relations in China is gradually 
expanding. The proportion of planned output in total industrial 
production has been seen to drop this year to 5 percent, while 
goods sold at state prices account for only around 10 percent of 
retail trade. 
  The Chinese securities market is developing successfully. 
Stock exchanges are operating in Shanghai and the Shenzhen 
special economic zone. Around 13,000 joint-stock and shared 
enterprises of various types have been registered. Shares in 
124 companies are quoted on the local stock market and shares in 
nine on foreign exchanges. In 1994 there are plans to issue 
shares worth 5.5 million yuan (one U.S. dollar is equivalent to 
approximately 8.5 yuan). And 22 enterprises will be authorized 
to sell shares abroad. 
  The liberalization of foreign economic activity is 
continuing. New spheres of investment opened up for foreign 
businessmen in 1993-1994 -- domestic trade, highway, railroad, 
and airfield construction, legal services, insurance, 
consultancy, auditing, etc. There are 93 banks and financial 
companies based on foreign capital at work in China. Duties on 
several thousand commodity groups have been considerably lowered 
in preparation for joining GATT. 
  Experiments have begun to transform state enterprises into 
joint-stock companies. The state's share of their capital will 
gradually decline. It is planned that only purely defense 
enterprises will remain in state ownership in five or seven 
years. China has decided to renounce voucher privatization. 
  A new tax system has been introduced as of 1 January 1994. 
The former turnover taxes have been replaced by value-added tax 
(at a rate of 17 percent -- 13 percent for some commodities) and 
excise duties. A single profits tax has been established for 
all enterprises regardless of their form of ownership (33 
percent). Income tax rates paid by individuals have been 
unified. Some new taxes have been introduced -- on real estate, 
inheritance, and the use of natural resources. 
  There have been changes in the system of tax payments into 
budgets of various levels. The center's share of total 
consolidated budget income will rise to 60 percent within five 
years (now 38 percent). 
  Reform of the banking system has begun. The People's Bank of 
China will be turned into a central bank responsible for 
maintaining the stability of the national currency and 
monitoring inflation. Three of the four specialized banks are 
being commercialized and the functions of providing preferential 
credit transferred to three new state banks specially set up for 
this purpose. Joint-stock commercial banks will be extensively 
developed. 
  As of 1 January 1994 the practice has been introduced 
whereby 
export enterprises have to sell all their hard-currency revenue 
to authorized banks. A single market rate has been fixed for 
the yuan. The circulation of foreign currency is banned in the 
country. Import enterprises buy currency from the banks at the 
market rate. 
  Despite what are by and large positive results of economic 
reform, certain alarming symptoms have emerged in China too. 
The country's economy is threatened with "overheating" due to 
excessive investment and credit, which is to a considerable 
extent covered by increasing the money supply. 
  Inflation has increased. Whereas in 1993 prices rose 13 
percent, in the first quarter of this year they are up 20 
percent. Over 80 percent of state enterprises are overtly or 
covertly lossmaking, which has brought about a drastic increase 
in defaults on payment. The high and uneven pace of industrial 
growth across various sectors has created new imbalances in the 
national economy. China's experience in combating these 
negative phenomena -- in a country where there is still tight 
state regulation -- could be extremely useful to Russian 
specialists. 
  In particular, Chinese methods of giving support to the 
agro-industrial complex deserve attention. The production of 
highly important agricultural produce is lossmaking here and is 
backed with income from rural industrial and service 
enterprises. There are over 20 million of these enterprises. 
  The social orientation of Chinese reforms is an extremely 
important aspect. Throughout the period of economic 
transformations increases in citizens' real income and 
improvements in housing conditions, medical services, and the 
social insurance system have been recorded. All this ensures 
extensive support among the population for the reform course.

  [Text] Santiago May 24 TASS -- "Chilean President Eduardo 
Frei Ruiz Tagle shares my opinion that only strong presidential 
power, combined with fruitful parliamentary activities, can 
ensure changes in a country," speaker of the Russian parliament 
upper chamber Vladimir Shumeyko said on Monday after a meeting 
with the Chilean leader at the La Moneda Palace. 
  Shumeyko leads a Russian delegation touring Latin America. 
  Replying to journalists, Shumeyko said that he conveyed a 
message by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the Chilean 
president. 
  According to the Russian speaker, the letter points to the 
importance of strengthening relations between countries which 
took a similar road of development -- Russia and Chile. "Our 
country has used to some extent Chilean experience in a search 
for civil accord," the message notes. 
  Shumeyko expressed confidence that interstate and 
intergovernment relations between the two countries will be 
actively developed. He specially pointed to the importance of 
developing cooperation between Russian and Chilean businessmen, 
stating that Russia, as well as Chile, banks on the private 
sector in its economy. 
  Later in the day, Shumeyko and other delegation members had 
a 
meeting with president of the Chilean Senate Gabriel Valdes, 
where the sides also pointed to the importance of boosting 
Russian-Chilean relations. 
  According to Valdes, Chile has record (for Latin America) 
investments in such foreign countries as Peru, Brazil, 
Argentina, etc. There is a possibility of making big Chilean 
investments in the Russian economy in future, the Senate 
president said. 
  "We do this not because we are rich but due to the fact that 
our economy is open," Valdes stressed.

  [Text] Moscow May 24 TASS -- Russia's diesel-powered 
submarines sold to North Korea for scrap metal cannot be 
restored and used in combat, Vice-Admiral Viktor Topilin told 
ITAR-TASS. 
  He rejected as groundless allegations that it is possible to 
dismantle the submarine missile launchers and assemble them 
again for use in land complexes. 
  The vice-admiral said the ballyhoo in Japan around the sale 
of 12 disarmed Russian submarines to North Korea aims at 
spreading disinformation. Many experts in the Russian Defence 
Ministry confirm to ITAR-TASS that they shared the 
vice-admiral's view. According to them, Japanese media reports 
were published in order to alleviate the shock caused by the 
fact that 70 kilogrammes of powdered plutonium were found in 
Japan's atomic industry centre, an amount sufficient to 
manufacture nine atomic bombs.

<F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report: "Restricted Shokhin, or Moscow </F>
Vaudeville Act"] 
  [Text] Seoul -- At the end of last week another spasm 
occurred in Russian foreign policy: The talks with Seoul over 
the whole range of trade and economic relations, pegged to the 
South Korean president's visit to Moscow, were suddenly called 
off. Although the leadership's active desire to hush up this 
affair and to avoid great publicity can be observed, there is no 
getting away from this extraordinary occurrence, and it is 
necessary to speak of it. 
  Russian diplomacy, writhing in convulsions brought on by the 
capricious situation at home and by unprofessionalism, has 
valiantly disgraced itself once again, having made even doubters 
come to believe that the problem of saving the face, prestige, 
and reputation of a civilized, stable partner in contacts with 
the outside world is either secondary or simply does not exist 
for the present Russian political elite. 
  We spat right in our own eye in the manner of a cheap 
vaudeville act: Just a few hours before the Russian delegation 
was due to arrive in Seoul (a special flight was planned for 
almost 50 high-ranking people, including several ministers and 
governors) Moscow informed the Koreans that Vice Premier 
Shokhin, head of the mission and cochairman of the bilateral 
intergovernmental Committee for Economic and 
Scientific-Technical Cooperation, could not leave his workplace 
because of some internal circumstances, and the delegation would 
hardly travel without its head; then another report arrived from 
Moscow, imparting the news that the measure which the sides had 
been working selflessly to prepare for almost two years would 
still take place, only instead of Shokhin, who is burdened with 
sudden difficulties, another vice premier -- Yarov -- would be 
in charge. True, Yarov is not particularly knowledgeable about 
Russian-Korean economic affairs but, on the other hand, he is of 
appropriate rank and is not bound by circumstances. Finally, 
two or three hours later, the "Yarov version" also fell through 
-- the Koreans were notified definitely that the Russian 
delegation would not appear in Seoul at all.... 
  Moscow's odd feint, which struck the Koreans to the very 
bottom of their oriental soul, was at first perceived in Seoul 
as a symptom of a sharp exacerbation of the internal political 
crisis in Russia, threatening major reshuffles in the Kremlin 
corridors and other large-scale upheavals minute by minute. 
Instead of upheavals, however, Shokhin participated in 
Russian-Finnish talks and other measures, the Council of 
Ministers met on schedule, and enigmatic Russian life clearly 
had no intention of becoming unsettled. This made the puzzled 
Koreans look for other explanations, engage in soul-searching, 
and urgently analyze how Seoul could have angered Moscow so 
greatly. The nerve-racking work ended in the conclusion that 
the Korean side had provided no grounds on the eve of the summit 
meeting for a cooling or, still less, the wrecking of the 
intergovernmental talks. When it became crystal clear that no 
other interpretation could be found for the surprise from 
Moscow, except that "restricted movement" status had been 
imposed on Vice Premier Shokhin, emotions flared in Seoul. The 
Koreans regarded our nice vaudeville act as an insult. 
  Just two factors have kept bilateral relations from major 
complications and a flat spin. The first, main factor is the 
aforementioned visit to Russia of Korean President Kim Yong-sam, 
which is scheduled for 1 June and remains on the agenda. The 
second is Yeltsin's personal message to Kim Yong-sam apologizing 
for the omission and assuring him that the calling off of the 
talks has no bearing on the bilateral dialogue. As is our 
custom, the letter did not arrive prior to the extraordinary 
occurrence but 24 hours after it, only after an adverse squall 
had swept through the Korean press. 
  It is clearly too soon to regard the incident as closed. The 
thing is that the called-off talks were conceived not only for 
the sake of inaugurating the intergovernmental Committee for 
Economic Cooperation but also as a kind of lightning conductor 
-- the sides were to have discussed in detail a number of 
complex issues in bilateral affairs so as not to submit them 
"raw" to the meeting of the two presidents. Central to these 
issues are the problem of Russia's failure to repay its debts 
relating to Korean credits, the question of compensation for 
those who died on board the downed Korean Boeing, and other far 
from cheerful issues. Since the lightning conductor has not 
worked, Moscow must be prepared for all this to surface in the 
summit talks and not improve the climate there. Another nuance 
is a purely personnel one. Both in Gaydar's cabinet and in 
Chernomyrdin's government the economic part of the Korean 
salient was entrusted to Shokhin, who visited Seoul repeatedly 
and "ran" bilateral affairs. The present misfire with regard to 
his trip to Korea will inevitably freeze the very figure of 
Shokhin for Seoul and undermine its trust in him, unless Yeltsin 
personally rehabilitates his vice premier within the next few 
days. 
  The biggest ricochet -- the severe blow to the prestige of 
Russian diplomacy and the undermining of the reputation as a 
reliable and stable partner -- will have to be kept in mind 
until "better times," since, as practice shows, Russia does not 
yet wish to learn from its own mistakes. Seoul believes, 
incidentally, that such "better times" will inevitably come in 
Moscow. 
  It remains to add that Poltoranin, former vice premier and 
current parliamentarian, has been noticed in Seoul instead of 
the restricted Vice Premier Shokhin. He has been noticed in the 
trading rows in the market. Diverse sources, however, are so 
far failing to mention the purpose of Poltoranian's visit to 
Korea. Surely not a new vaudeville act?...

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Oliynik report: "Such A Long Return"] </F>
  [Excerpts] As has already been reported, an official 
ceremony to hand over two Soviet POW's -- the Russians Aleksey 
Olenin and Yuriy Stepanov -- to the Russian side was held at 
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's residence 16 May. On 
22 May KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent was among those who met 
their countrymen at Sheremetyevo-2 International Airport off the 
flight from Islamabad. Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, Pakistani 
ambassador to Russia, was among the welcoming party. [passage 
omitted] 
  All the parents of men captured in the Afghan War have been 
waiting for just such a moment. Unfortunately, there is still 
no accurate information on how many of our POW's are held in 
war-torn Afghanistan. Although the total number of MIA's, 
according to Russian Federation Defense Ministry figures, is 
290. It is known from various sources that only 60 or 70 of 
them are alive. 
  "The complex work to find Soviet POW's is being held up for 
a 
whole host of reasons," I was told by Russian delegation member 
Leonid Biryukov, the man from the CIS Heads of Government 
Council Committee for Internationalist Servicemen Affairs who is 
responsible for the search for MIA's. "First and foremost, 
because a fierce internecine power struggle is under way in 
Afghanistan. President Rabbani now has no time for our 
prisoners, although he has stated that he will do everything in 
his power to free them." 
  In conversation with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent, 
Tatyana 
Samolis, press secretary to the director of the Foreign 
Intelligence Service, stressed that the search for former Soviet 
soldiers is one of the areas for cooperation between Russian 
intelligence and similar departments in other states -- 
primarily those which can have a real influence on solving this 
problem. She noted that the release of Olenin and Stepanov was 
possible thanks to the close collaboration between two special 
services -- the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service and the 
Pakistani Defense Ministry's Inter Services Intelligence.

  [text] Crimea's President Yuriy Meshkov declared that a 
Crimean parliamentary delegation has arrived in Kiev for talks 
with the Ukrainian leadership to conclude a treaty and settle 
the conflict. In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX on Tuesday 
[24 May], he said that the situation would not reach the 
critical point. 
  Asked whether Crimea might go back on its decision to 
restore 
the 1992 Constitution on dual citizenship and formal relations 
with Ukraine, Meshkov remarked that the decision had been taken 
by Crimea's parliament rather than president. Consequently, it 
is for Crimean legislators to decide how to respond to the 
ultimatum by Kiev, which has given Simferopol ten days to 
reconsider the decision. He recalled that he had asked Crimean 
lawmakers to postpone debates on the revision of the 
constitution. 
  Queried whether Crimea expected help from Russia, Meshkov 
replied, "It would be enough to warn against the use of force in 
efforts to solve our problems." In his words, the Crimean 
leadership has been constantly in touch with Moscow on the 
issue. However, he evaded answer to a question on what precisely 
"Moscow tells" him. 
  Asked about a solution to the Black Sea Fleet's problem, 
President Meshkov replied, "It has become more obvious that it 
is quite complex to come to grips with the problem without us. 
From the start of the talks on the issue Russia has negotiated 
from a reasonable and balanced position, suggesting that Crimea 
would take part in these negotiations or at least send its 
observers there." 
  Ukraine seeks to force Crimea out of Ukraine, which was 
explicit when General Radetskyy (defense minister -- IF) barred 
the Crimean president from the talks on the Black Sea Navy in 
Simferopol, "He clearly deals with us as an adversary," Meshkov 
said.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 25 May TASS -- In connection with the package 
of six presidential decrees, signed on 23 May 1994, Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin has addressed a letter to the State Duma 
(lower chamber of the Russian parliament), calling its attention 
to several circumstances. 
  "The proclamation of these decrees," the letter says, "is 
dictated by the imperative need to pull the country out of the 
economic crisis and to continue the reforms. Due to various 
reasons, the present legislation does not ensure the needed 
conditions for the effective reformation of the Russian economy. 
Due to this, and in order to fulfil their constitutional duties 
and the president's and government's commitments under the 
social concord agreement, a decision was adopted to step up the 
ongoing economic transformations. 
  The president informed the State Duma that after the 
adoption 
of his decrees, the Government of the Russian Federation was 
instructed to submit to the Federal Assembly (parliament) bills, 
worked out on their basis, so that the latter could adopt 
amendments and supplements to the legislation in force. "The 
decrees, in the part relating to the competence of the Federal 
Assembly, will remain in force until corresponding federal laws 
are adopted," the president's letter says.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 25 May TASS -- "Social aspects have become 
decisive in the formation of the Russian Armed Forces," said 
Major-General Vladimir Osadchy, one of head officials of the 
main department for military budget and financing of the Russian 
Defence Ministry. In an interview with ITAR-TASS Osadchy said 
that funds allocated at present to the defence industry 
automatically put servicemen in an unequal social position. The 
military budget has been scheduled so that at least half of 
servicemen will not be given pay in at the time envisaged by 
law. Two or three months of existence without pay will enviably 
worsen the situation among the military personnel and in 
military garrisons, Osadchy said. 
  In his opinion, parliamentary hearings on social aspects of 
the military reform scheduled in the State Duma on Wednesday [25 
May] will help clarify the situation. The Defence Ministry does 
not claim privileges in financing, taking into account budgetary 
difficulties faced by the country. However, it is inadmissible 
that electricity, fuel and food supplies be stopped to garrisons 
and military canteens because of the lack of funds, Osdachy 
said. The Defence Ministry must pay both for military hardware 
and ammunition, while there are no funds to do so," Osadchy said. 
  The Duma committee for defence has repeatedly brought up the 
subject of defence financing. However, constructive and 
competent resolutions adopted by the committee do not always 
meet the support of lawmakers, Osadchy said, adding that some 
lawmakers use debates on the military budget for purposes which 
have nothing to do with Russia's national interests.

  [Text] The National Bank of Belarus (NBB) has declared the 
Belarusian payment coupon (nicknamed "zaichik", or "little 
hare") the only legal tender in the Republic from 1 June until 
the moment the agreement on monetary unification with Russia 
comes into force. 
  The NBB told INTERFAX that it had made the decision "in view 
of the amount of time it is taking to unify the monetary systems 
of Russia and Belarus and the fact that the current state of 
confusion regarding payments cannot be allowed to continue." 
According to the NBB decision, all accounting in Belarus will 
be carried out only in the payment coupons until the monetary 
union officially takes place and all commercial organizations 
must convert their assets from Russian rubles to "zaichiki" at 
the official NBB exchange rate (10.5 to the Russian rubles on 24 
May) within the shortest period of time. 
  The NBB will set a special exchange rate every week for 
operations not involving trade and charges for services 
(especially transport and communications).

<F P=106> [Interview with Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov by an </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "Not in 
Control of the Situation"] 
  [Text] [FOCUS] You are calling for stronger links between 
the Crimea and Russia. Is that not a provocation vis-a-vis Kiev? 
  [Meshkov] We are currently witnessing how the Ukrainian 
Government is trying to fan the conflict. The present 
leadership in Kiev is trying to hold on to power somehow. 
However, it lacks social support and is no longer in control of 
the situation. That is because its policies have failed in 
almost every respect. This particularly applies to the 
economy, and the situation is all the worse because a people 
that inhabits a state with enormous potential has been condemned 
to vegetate in poverty. 
  [FOCUS] Your movement is accused of Russian nationalism, 
separatism, and even political adventurism.... 
  [Meshkov] On the contrary, the aim of our policies is to 
protect the Crimea from nationalist excesses. 
  [FOCUS] But the Crimean Tartars are afraid of your flirting 
with Moscow. How do you want to solve the Tartar question? 
  [Meshkov] Crimean citizens of Tartar nationality were 
treated unjustly, and that has to be put right. Unfortunately, 
the Crimean Republic is not in a position to bear the financial 
cost of a just solution. However, I would like to stress that 
the present difficulties do not bear nationalist hallmarks. 
  [FOCUS] President Kravchuk has not allowed you to change the 
security minister and the minister of internal affairs. Your 
power has thus been somewhat curtailed. 
  [Meshkov] That illustrates the kind of conditions we are 
working under here. The Crimean security service should work to 
protect the Crimean Republic even if it is considered part of 
Ukraine. However, I have not even received a fraction of the 
information that it sends to Kiev. That is why I had to appoint 
a new minister. Kiev's machinations aimed at preventing that 
move must be considered very disturbing. 
  [FOCUS] The defense ministers of Ukraine and Russia do not 
want you to take part in negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet. 
Did you feel snubbed? 
  [Meshkov] Even if a president is ignored, the people that 
elected him will not allow itself to be ignored.

  [Text] The Black Sea Fleet officers have urged the 
Ukrainian, Russian and Crimean presidents, the CIS heads of 
state and heads of parliament to settle complicated state and 
regional issues only through normal negotiations. 
  The Black Sea Fleet press center told INTERFAX that the 
statement had been adopted by the fleet officer meetings 
coordinating council in Sevastopol on 24 May. Officers 
recommended that the CIS leaders give the appropriate evaluation 
to representatives of the Ukrainian power structures stating 
their readiness for any decisive actions and to warn them about 
personal responsibility for possible consequences. 
  Due to the concentration of troops in Crimea the Black Sea 
Fleet officers proposed that the Ukrainian, Russian and Crimean 
presidents guarantee that no force would be used. The Ukrainian 
Security Service and Interior Ministry must report on the 
additional military formations arrived in Sevastopol without any 
notification to the local authorities, the officers emphasized. 
  The statement underlined that military officers must not be 
hostages during struggle for posts and reorganization of the 
society among politicians.

people of Azerbaijan on the occasion of the Festival of 
Sacrifice. I wish you and the people of the Republic happiness 
and an auspicious future. [passage omitted] 
  The religious festivals are auspicious and happy occasions 
for the people. However, our people are in a very difficult 
situation at the present time. Azerbaijan has been subjected to 
Armenia's military aggression for six years now. It has been 
forced to fight to safeguard its territory. A serious situation 
exists in the Republic. Azerbaijan's brave and heroic sons have 
been martyred while trying to defend our territory. Our refugee 
sisters, brothers, and sons from Shusha, Lachin, Khodzhaly, and 
Malybeyli have met here today. They prove that our people are 
in a difficult situation. However, they are optimistic. They 
have never bowed their heads. They have never yielded. That 
being the case, we have not forgotten our traditions and customs 
even at this serious time and we have moved to celebrate the 
Festival of Sacrifice. 
  Undoubtedly, marking the occasion in prosperity and security 
is impossible. We are all aware of that state of affairs. 
However, we all feel happy and optimistic on this day. That is 
why I have come here to meet you. That is why I have come here 
to meet the people who have suffered most in Azerbaijan. 
  I repeat that you have suffered significantly. You have been 
forced to abandon your homes and places of birth during the past 
two years. You have lost the property you inherited from your 
forefathers. You have martyrs in your families. I am well 
aware of the fact that each and every family in this gathering 
has missing persons and martyrs. All the families are grieving. 
However, you must rest assured that each and every patriotic 
citizen of Azerbaijan shares your grief. I have congratulated 
you on the occasion of the Festival of Sacrifice. Nevertheless, 
my heart is full of grief. I share your grief. I have been 
elected president through the people's will. That means that I 
have to grieve more than anyone else. Rest assured that I do. 
  I have put my hope in you and the people of Azerbaijan. You 
must rest assured that I shall spare no effort in the struggle I 
wage to fulfill your expectations and those of all the people. 
  On the occasion of the Festival of Sacrifice, I commemorate 
our sons, sisters, and brothers who have sacrificed their lives 
for the defense of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and 
independence. I wish to reiterate that their heroic services 
will never be forgotten. We shall cherish their memory in our 
hearts forever. Through their heroic services and martyrdom, 
they have become an everlasting monument. I call upon you to 
observe silence for one minute to commemorate those who fell to 
become martyrs while defending our homeland. [silence observed 
for one minute] 
  God bless their souls. God give patience to their families, 
sisters, and sons. I pray that God also give you patience and 
protect you. I wish to reiterate that the blood of the martyrs 
will be avenged. Azerbaijan's people will maintain the struggle 
that the martyrs waged. They will reestablish Azerbaijan's 
territorial integrity. [applause] 
  We are well aware that you are in a serious situation. You 
have been living as refugees during the past two years. You 
have found a place to live in the recreation buildings in this 
place, which were constructed in the past. I am aware that they 
are not spacious. However, we are all aware that the majority of 
those who have recently become refugees are now living in tents 
and places that are even worse. They are living in tents in 
Imishlinskiy, Sabirabadskiy, Agdzhabedinskiy, and other rayons. 
  It is common knowledge that Azerbaijan has lost 20 percent 
of 
its territory in the war, which has continued for six years. 
This territory has been occupied by the Armenian military 
forces. It is common knowledge that more than one million 
citizens from Shusha, Malybeyli, Khodzhaly, Lachin, Kelbadzhar, 
and other towns and cities in Daghlyk Karabakh have become 
refugees during that period. We have been taking measures under 
very difficult conditions to help them. Considering your 
problems, I wish to inform you that I greatly appreciate your 
steadfast resistance and patience. Thank you for maintaining 
your steadfast nature. Thank you for enduring the tragic 
situation, which applies to all the people. That is a unique 
aspect of the Republic's people. [passage omitted] 
  The difficult times will pass and Azerbaijan's people will 
have a happy and prosperous life in their independent country in 
the future. I have confidence in that and I wish to assure you 
that the state, the government organs, and the president will 
spare no effort to achieve that objective. [applause] 
  I wish to take advantage of this meeting to convey my 
views on the recent developments and the situation in our 
Republic. It is common knowledge that Armenia has consistently 
maintained its military aggression against Azerbaijan over the 
past few years. Consequently, we have lost a part of our 
territory. Several measures have been taken since my return from 
Nakhichevan to Azerbaijan to establish the Azerbaijan Armed 
Forces and other conditions needed for the defense of our 
republic. Several measures have been taken to enable Azerbaijan 
to adopt a policy on the war with Armenia and the developments 
in the world, that is, a policy in line with the people's 
interests. 
  You are well-aware of those measures. Most probably, you are 
also aware of the war, the political developments in the 
Republic, the struggle waged by various groups for power, and 
the activities of individual people against the general 
population's interests significantly curtailed Azerbaijan's 
potential in the economic, intellectual, cultural, and social 
fields over the past few years. You will remember that several 
people at this gathering reminded me that in the past we have 
met in Shusha and in the cemetery at Baku. One of them told me 
that I had presented the order of merit to her. But, those were 
different occasions. Our people had a comfortable and 
prosperous life at the time. Please remember the work we 
carried out to renovate Shusha in the 1970's. [passage omitted 
lauding past renovation and construction work] 
  We have taken measures to enable Azerbaijan to end the war. 
In addition, we have taken measures to establish and strengthen 
the Azerbaijani Army and set up our defense positions. We have 
taken political measures to find a peaceful solution to the war. 
We have conferred with influential countries, and tried to use 
various opportunities to benefit from international 
organizations. Meanwhile, we have consolidated our military 
strength, reactivated our economic potential to a certain 
extent, and upgraded our foreign policy. Furthermore, we have 
made an effort to use political measures to end the war and 
remove the problems of the people. I wish to inform you that 
the measures we have taken and the work we have done have 
yielded results and will continue to do so in the future. 
  You are well-aware of the situation of our military forces 
in 
the past. It was not that we did not have an army, however the 
military units were [words indistinct]. The people of Shusha, 
Khodzhaly, and Daghlyk Karabakh are well-aware of that state of 
affairs. We made efforts to establish a regular army and have 
achieved significant success. We now have a regular army. You 
are well-aware that our military forces launched attacks against 
the Armenian Armed Forces over the past few months, particularly 
after October and November 1993. As a result of those attacks, 
we reclaimed a part of the occupied territories. Consequently, 
Azerbaijan's military forces proved their high capability to the 
entire world. The Armenians and the Armenian Armed Forces 
realized that as well. The Armenian military units were forced 
to withdraw. That is only a part of the outcome of our work. 
  However, we are well-aware that the war will lead to more 
tragic situations if it is allowed to continue for another three 
or five years. With that in mind, we wish to end the war. We 
wish to find a peaceful solution to the dispute. That can be 
achieved only through talks. Your sons must not be killed. 
That can be prevented only through talks. We have held talks 
from time to time. 
  You are well-aware that the dispute on Daghlyk Karabakh has 
a 
significant place in the policies of all the world's countries. 
Each and every country in the world has expressed its opinion on 
the Daghlyk Karabakh dispute. Regrettably, Azerbaijan 
maintained a weak policy and failed to put its weight down in 
international platforms over the past few years. Furthermore, 
the officials responsible for Azerbaijan's policy were 
unsuccessful. Consequently, the influential countries, mainly 
the European countries and the United States, were convinced 
that Azerbaijan had to be blamed and that the Armenians in 
Daghlyk Karabakh were deprived of their rights. International 
opinion has supported the Armenian side. That is a fact. Maybe 
you may not be aware of that state of affairs, however we are 
well-aware of the situation. Those who were involved in 
politics in the past, and those who have currently appeared on 
the scene claiming to be politicians, are also well-aware of 
that state of affairs. Consequently, we have made efforts over 
the past few months to end the war by finding a peaceful 
solution to the dispute, but on the condition that the occupied 
territories are returned to the Republic. Then, Azerbaijan's 
territorial integrity would be restored, and the non-violation 
of the Republic's borders is observed. However, you must 
realize that achieving all that is not easy. 
  The general view of international platforms and 
organizations 
has been against Azerbaijan. Our territories have been occupied 
as a result of the inefficiency and treachery of those who were 
responsible for Azerbaijan's future. Undoubtedly, all that has 
created very serious problems for us, and during the talks we 
have had to find a peaceful solution to the problem. Many 
countries around the world support Armenia. Meanwhile, we have 
been unable to remove the Armenian military forces from our 
territories. Consequently, the Armenian side has put forward 
conditions in the talks. Can you realize how serious and 
difficult that situation is? A wise and well-considered policy 
has to be maintained. Yes, that is the kind of policy we are 
trying to maintain. 
  You are well aware that Azerbaijan's relations with Russia 
have deteriorated significantly during the past few years. 
Obviously, an organization that called itself the Azerbaijan 
Popular Front but that failed to concern itself with the 
people's problems created a very unfavorable situation between 
Azerbaijan and Russia. The question of international politics is 
a complex matter. No country in the world, including small 
countries, must avoid maintaining a realistic approach. How can 
Azerbaijan, which recently achieved its independence but is 
still unable to stand on its feet as an independent country, 
allow itself to maintain a state of discord with a great country 
like Russia? Is that possible? Anyway, there is no reason for 
that. Azerbaijan has been influenced by Russia for 200 years. 
Whether we like it or not, that is a historic fact. Many kinds 
of relations were established between Azerbaijan and Russia in 
those years, including humanitarian, economic, scientific, and 
technical relations. How can those relations be destroyed? How 
can more than one million Azerbaijani people in Russia be 
ignored? How can we force a great country to be an enemy of 
Azerbaijan? That is absurd. 
  In view of that, we made an effort to normalize Azerbaijan's 
relations with Russia. I am convinced that we have succeeded. 
Azerbaijan's relations with Russia are at a very favorable level 
at the present time. We have established friendly relations. 
That must be the situation in the future. Each and every 
independent country should have friends in the world. 
Neighboring countries should be friendly, not hostile. That is 
what we have tried to achieve. Furthermore, it is common 
knowledge that we have joined the CIS. That was very essential. 
All that has created a significant basis for a peaceful 
solution to the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. 
  Meanwhile, we have made an effort to establish close 
relations with other countries. For example, we have 
traditional, friendly, and fraternal relations with Turkey. We 
are maintaining our friendly and fraternal relations. It is 
common knowledge that I have visited that country and signed 
important agreements. We have very sincere relations with the 
top officials in Turkey. 
  Iran is a close neighbor. Millions of Azerbaijani people 
live in that country. We have had close relations with that 
country for many centuries. However, the policy that was 
maintained until recently disrupted the relations between 
Azerbaijan and Iran. That country became our enemy. 
Nevertheless, we rectified that situation. President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani visited Azerbaijan and signed several 
agreements. Consequently, our economic, humanitarian, and 
cultural relations are developing in a very favorable way at the 
present time. 
  We have also made an effort to improve our relations with 
the 
influential countries in the world. The United States is a 
great country. It has a significant influence on international 
politics. A very chilled atmosphere prevailed in Azerbaijan's 
relations with the United States in the past. We improved that 
state of affairs and I am convinced that the effort we have made 
has yielded positive results. You will recall that the U.S. 
Congress adopted an unjust resolution against Azerbaijan in 
September 1992. That was because of unwise policies and the 
inactivity of Azerbaijan's leading officials at the time. The 
resolution banned any U.S. aid to Azerbaijan in accordance with 
Article 9/7 [as heard] of the U.S. law on freedom because 
Azerbaijan supposedly blockaded Armenia. The U.S. Congress 
adopted that resolution, which created a significant precipice 
between Azerbaijan and that country two years ago. 
  Azerbaijan's relations with Russia and the United States 
deteriorated in the past. Had the officials--who supposedly 
governed Azerbaijan in the past and who now claim that they are 
great politicians--maintained a wise policy, Azerbaijan's 
relations with Russia, Iran, and the United States would not 
have been disrupted and the U.S. congress would not have adopted 
that resolution. 
  We have carried out significant work in that direction. I 
have held talks with U.S. officials who have visited Azerbaijan 
several times. We also maintain contact with U.S. officials 
through other means. 
  I can also inform you that President Clinton sent a letter 
to 
me a month ago. It indicated a positive shift in the U.S. 
approach toward Azerbaijan. President Clinton described the 
resolution, which banned any U.S. aid to Azerbaijan, as an 
unjust decision. That was the first time he did so. 
Furthermore, he informed me that he will work to have the 
Congress cancel that resolution. Considering Azerbaijan's 
present situation, I am convinced that this move is a very 
appreciated step by President Clinton. 
  President Clinton also conveyed a congratulatory message to 
me on the occasion of the Festival of Sacrifice on 17 May. I 
believe that the meaning of that message is important from two 
aspects. First, it indicates that the United States is aware of 
our national and religious festivals. President Clinton has 
congratulated Azerbaijan's people through me on the occasion of 
this festival. Second, it indicates that President Clinton 
appreciates Azerbaijan's efforts to find a peaceful solution to 
the Daghlyk Karabakh dispute, particularly within the CSCE 
framework. In fact, he has said that the U.S. Administration 
will also work on the matter. 
  Those two aspects indicate that the talks we have had with 
the United States within the framework of our foreign policy 
have yielded positive results. A large U.S. delegation arrived 
in Azerbaijan on 15 May. We held very fruitful talks with those 
officials. 
  Furthermore, you are aware that I visited France at the 
invitation of President Mitterrand, Britain at the invitation of 
Prime Minister John Major, and the PRC at the invitation of 
President Jiang Zemin. Very useful work was carried out during 
my visits. The UN Security Council has five permanent members. 
They are the United States, Russia, Britain, France, and the 
PRC. I have held talks with the leaders of four of those 
countries. You are aware that I have held talks with President 
Boris Yeltsin several times. I met with the leading officials 
of France, Britain, and the PRC during my visits. Our 
independent Republic signed very important agreements with them. 
Can you imagine, a new and independent Republic like Azerbaijan 
has established close relations with several countries that 
influence international politics. Official visits have taken 
place and fruitful agreements have been signed. All this has 
given Azerbaijan publicity in the international community. 
Unfortunately, we have had many problems in connection with 
that matter in the past. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's position in 
the world has strengthened. A significant opportunity has been 
created to remove the serious situation in our Republic. 
  However, that is not all the details of our foreign policy. 
But I do not wish to give you detailed information on it. My 
intention is to express my opinion and focus only on the need to 
find a peaceful way to end the war between Azerbaijan and 
Armenia. I am convinced that we have to strengthen our defense 
forces and consolidate our capability to defend ourselves. 
Meanwhile, we must also use all the existing opportunities. 
For example, we are holding talks with Russia, the United 
States, and Turkey on the matter. We are also in constant touch 
with the UN Security Council and the CSCE. We are making a very 
serious effort. 
  I have realized the importance of the CSCE's effort to find 
a 
peaceful solution to the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia ever 
since I took office as president. In view of that, we have 
cooperated with that organization. The Minsk Group, which is 
made up of nine countries, is affiliated with the CSCE. I have 
been constantly in touch with its chairman. The CSCE Minsk 
Group used to be headed by Mario Raffaelli. It is now headed by 
Mr. Jan Eliasson. I have held talks with Mr. Eliasson and his 
delegations in Azerbaijan several times. I have explained 
Azerbaijan's position to them for hours and days. Yes, I have 
worked to have the CSCE play the main role in the effort made to 
resolve the dispute. I will continue to work in that direction 
in the future. 
  Mr. Eliasson recently visited Azerbaijan. We held talks and 
agreed that the CSCE should make initiatives for a cease-fire. 
We also agreed that measures should be taken later for the 
signing of a cease-fire agreement to end the war. Naturally, 
Mr. Eliasson also cooperates with Armenia and Russia. He 
disclosed in our latest talks that the problem should be 
resolved within the CSCE framework. However, he also said that 
Russia should play a special role. That was his proposal. I 
wish to inform you that Russia has made an effort to mediate for 
the solution of the problem. We have not objected to that. On 
the contrary, we have tried to benefit from that approach. We 
have to use each and every opportunity. So, we have approved 
the joint effort by the CSCE and Russia. That was proposed by 
the CSCE. It was proposed by Jan Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE 
Minsk Group. 
  Meanwhile, we have taken a step to promote our work in the 
international community. You are aware of the existence of 
NATO. [passage omitted] 
  The heads of state in that organization convened in Brussels 
and approved a program to create the conditions required by the 
former Warsaw Pact countries, which have now become independent, 
to join NATO. They adopted the program on partnership for peace 
and disclosed that the countries that have recently become 
independent may join it. We considered the matter and decided 
that Azerbaijan will strengthen its position in the world if it 
joins that program. Therefore, we made a decision and I traveled 
to Brussels, which hosts NATO Headquarters. I addressed a 
meeting in that headquarters and disclosed that Azerbaijan is 
prepared to join the program on partnership for peace. In fact, 
I signed that program. Four CIS countries have signed that 
program; Azerbaijan is the fourth. The remaining CIS members 
have not signed it. I am convinced that Azerbaijan's decision 
to sign that program was right politically and diplomatically. 
Furthermore, it was a daring step. 
  I was informed by a CSCE representative in Brussels that 
Russia and the CIS must join the effort that is made to resolve 
the Daghlyk Karabakh dispute and find a peaceful way to end the 
war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. He said that the CSCE 
believes that it must carry out joint work with Russia and the 
CIS. I responded by saying that we shall support that approach, 
since the CSCE is in favor of it. The important thing to us is 
to end the war. Azerbaijan will not object to a CSCE move to 
cooperate with a foreign country to end the war. 
  So, a new formula was drawn up. Jan Eliasson arrived in 
Baku on the basis of that formula on 13 May. He presented a 
draft agreement for a cease-fire. The draft also called for the 
consolidation of the cease-fire regime. We had made several 
initiatives for a cease-fire. For example, we proposed a 
cease-fire through Russia's mediation on 28 April. However, 
Armenia objected to it. Later, we maintained our initiatives 
for the same purpose. They, too, were rejected by Armenia. The 
interparliamentary assembly convened in Bishkek on 5 May. The 
Daghlyk Karabakh dispute was discussed in that convocation. 
Afiyettin Dzhelilov headed Azerbaijan's delegation to that 
meeting. We gave instructions to him on various issues. We 
informed him that we had to attend that meeting and hold talks 
with the other participants. However, we instructed him that 
Azerbaijan must not sign any document without the approval of 
its president. We dispatched Dzhelilov to Bishkek with that 
instruction. He acted accordingly. A document was placed on 
the table. He said that he was not able to sign it. Later, we 
studied the document. It contained a provision for a 
cease-fire. Consequently, he decided that Azerbaijan should sign 
it. Chairman of the National Assembly Rasul Guliyev signed the 
document with our approval on 8 May. A cease-fire began on 10 
May. Exchanges of fire have not taken place since that day. 
  The objective of Azerbaijan signing the Bishkek protocol was 
to have a cease-fire. We have achieved our objective. That was 
the right thing to do. Meanwhile, we held talks with Jan 
Eliasson. He submitted a draft document for the consolidation 
of the cease-fire regime on 13 May. We were satisfied with it 
and we suggested that he should consult with Armenia. He 
visited Armenia. The Armenian officials made some changes in 
the draft document in accordance with their views. Eliasson 
returned to Baku on 16 May. The defense ministers of Russia, 
Azerbaijan, and Armenia held a meeting in Moscow at the time. 
Yes, an initiative was made for such a meeting and we had 
agreed to it. I wish to reiterate that we have tried to use 
every opportunity. The defense ministers met in Moscow for two 
or three days. Russia's defense minister held a press 
conference on 16 May. He disclosed without Azerbaijan's 
approval that Russia's peacekeeping forces will be deployed as 
observers in areas between Azerbaijan and Armenia. He also 
disclosed that a few battalions, that is, some 1,800 men, will 
be dispatched to the region. Later, he urged Azerbaijan to sign 
a protocol on that matter. 
  However, considering that such a protocol would be 
inappropriate for Azerbaijan, I instructed the Republic's 
defense minister not to sign it and to immediately return to 
Baku. Jan Eliasson was in Baku at the time. He was briefed on 
that matter. We agreed to his draft document and he returned to 
Yerevan. The officials in Armenia refrained from signing the 
document Jan Eliasson brought to us from Yerevan. So, that 
confirmed that Azerbaijan supports peace and wishes to end the 
war. It also was an indication that confirmed Azerbaijan's wish 
to resolve the dispute through international organizations and 
Russia. However, Armenia has exposed itself. It has confirmed 
that it does not wish to end the war. Later, Jan Eliasson 
returned to Vienna. He is continuing his work. 
  Meanwhile, we summoned the Republic's defense minister from 
Moscow. We also disclosed that we could not sign that protocol. 
I wish to inform you that the CSCE, the Minsk Group, and Jan 
Eliasson are in close contact with Russia. They wish to 
maintain their cooperation. 
  That is all that I can say on the developments. I wish to 
draw your attention to the fact that exchanges of fire have not 
taken place since 10 May. I believe that this is a positive 
development for Azerbaijan. Our military forces heroically 
fought during the past few months. However, we have had many 
casualties. I wish to clearly say that there have been days 
when we had 50 martyrs in one place alone. Azerbaijan's 
officers have died together with their troops. They fought to 
defend our territories. The Armenians planned to occupy Terter 
by 1 May. They also planned to occupy Barda later. Their plans 
were foiled because our military forces steadfastly maintained 
their positions. 
  The Armenians have other plans too. However, you must 
realize that Armenia is not waging war by itself; you are 
well-aware of that. No, Armenia is not waging the war by 
itself. You are well-aware of the countries and forces that 
support it. Had it only been Armenia, Azerbaijan's military 
forces would have evicted them from the republic's territory, 
even though our forces are not yet at full strength. However, 
that is connected with international politics. We are unable to 
influence the policies of certain forces and countries in the 
world, who act as they please. Therefore, we have to maintain a 
wide-ranging policy, and we need experience and information in 
order to be able to do so. We have to analyze and draw 
conclusions. I am convinced that you believe that we are 
capable of doing so. As president, I occupy myself with all 
those matters round the clock. 
  Regardless of all that and at a time when our republic is 
working in various directions, certain internal forces continue 
to try to create discord among us. I am confident that the 
people do not believe them. I am aware that the people trust 
me. Some 7 million people in Azerbaijan trusted me and elected 
me president. I rely on the people's support. I rely on your 
support. I rely on the support of the people of Azerbaijan. 
  Why have I said all this? In an effort to create discord in 
the republic, some individuals have recently claimed that 
Azerbaijan's leaders are making the wrong moves. What does that 
mean? I have already explained the developments related to the 
Bishkek protocol. On 18 May, a group of deputies in the National 
Assembly--they were Etibar Mamedov, several deputies from the 
Azerbaijan People's Front, and a few others who always vacillate 
on way and the other. [shouts against the Azerbaijan People's 
Front from the audience] 
  Please be calm. I can see that you, too, have many things to 
say. I am addressing you at this moment. I wish to express my 
views. Later, I will give the floor to anyone who wishes to 
speak. 
  Yes, they demanded that the National Assembly place the 
Bishkek Protocol on its agenda. There is nothing to debate in 
the Bishkek Protocol. The main objective of that protocol is to 
effect a cease-fire. Their actions indicate that they do not 
wish to see a cease-fire imposed. They want people to be 
killed. This matter was debated; I attended that session. We 
voted on the matter. The parliament has its rules. Their 
motion did not pass. The Bishkek Protocol was not placed on the 
agenda; then a recess was called. Some 15 deputies presented an 
ultimatum and walked out when the National Assembly reconvened. 
The remaining members of the National Assembly, who were in the 
majority, issued a statement against them. 
  The walkout by the deputies conflicts with the ethics and 
experience of a respected parliament. It confirms that their 
cultural levels are not high enough. Obviously, they have used 
uncivilized ways and means to achieve their goals thus far. As 
president, I condemn their actions. I am confident that the 
people will support me. I urge them to refrain from lawlessness. 
  However, the matter does not end there. I could have decided 
not to mention these matters, but I feel obliged to do so. 
  Later, Etibar Mamedov held a meeting in the building which 
houses his political party with a few inefficient individuals 
who supposedly represent the Azerbaijan People's Front and the 
Karabakh Liberation Movement. Have you heard about that 
movement? Let the members of that movement go to fight in 
Karabakh. They should not create such a state of affairs for 
the people. We have a political party which is known as Bozkurt 
[Gray Wolf]. It is led by Iskendar Khamidov. He and several 
others have issued a statement, which is disgusting and unjust 
and which conflicts with our present day national interests. It 
is full of lies and calumnies. It claims that Russian military 
units have arrived in Azerbaijan and that we wish to have them 
defend our republic. 
  No Russian military units have been deployed in Azerbaijan. 
The people must not be misled. I have explained the measures 
we have taken during the past few months. The television 
network will further inform the people on what I have outlined. 
No Russian military units have arrived in Azerbaijan. The 
people must not be misled. Furthermore, if they are opposed to 
the measures that have been taken by the government, then they 
should hold talks with the officials. Azerbaijan is an 
independent country. Its president has been elected by the 
people. The people hate secret meetings that are held in dark 
rooms to draw up plots. Those are lawless activities, which no 
one can tolerate. 
  They met again yesterday to draw up a policy for national 
resistance. They disclosed that they will hold a large meeting. 
What kind of a meeting will that be? Who is to organize it? 
Yes, they are Etibar Mamedov, Iskendar Khamidov, Tofik Gasumov, 
Isa Kamberov, Ibragim Ibragimov, and several other people like 
them. They established a committee yesterday and urged the 
people to attend the meeting they will organize. Undoubtedly, 
the people will not allow them to hold such a meeting. The 
state laws will be enforced if they act in a lawless way. Each 
and every one of them will be penalized accordingly. I wish to 
make that clear. [applause] 
  Regarding the movement that has been established by those 
individuals, I believe that it conflicts with Azerbaijan's 
national interests. [Shouts of "Treachery"] 
  Yes, I regard it as an act of treachery. Thank God that an 
administration exists in Azerbaijan. Thank God that Azerbaijan 
has a president and state organs. However, a handful of 
individuals in the streets ignore them and claim that they 
themselves wish to defend Azerbaijan's people. The people have 
entrusted the president they elected with the duty of defending 
them. The president is the guarantor of the people's security 
in Azerbaijan. He guarantees the people's rights and protects 
the republic's territory. [applause] Who has authorized those 
individuals to assume those responsibilities? Who are they? 
  You are well-aware that I do not wish to say anything about 
them, because I do not wish to lower myself to their level. The 
people are already aware of their situation; but I do not wish 
to lower myself to their level. If they wish to improve their 
situation, then they will have to do the right work for 10 or 15 
years. None of them have any experience in any field. They 
have gathered together from here and there and from the streets. 
[passage indistinct] 
  We have opened the door to democracy. Political parties have 
been established. More than 40 political parties have 
registered in Azerbaijan. The newspapers publish whatever they 
wish. They published [words indistinct] and calumnies. In view 
of democracy and pluralism in politics, I have not objected to 
all that. Nor will I do so in the future. However, I will not 
allow any calumny or activity aimed at misleading the people and 
encouraging them to commit crimes. I wish to inform everyone in 
that regard. [applause] 
  I have respected Etibar Mamedov. However, I can see that 
several of you do not like him. Nevertheless, I have respected 
him because he has carried out political work to a certain 
extent. I hope that he will hear and understand what I am going 
to say now. He must assess my respect for him. There is no 
reason for him to maintain the claims he has made. [applause] 
  Etibar Mamedov has had only one objective in mind for the 
past three or four years: He only wished to come to power. 
Well, he was a candidate in the presidential elections, along 
with Abulfaz Elchibey, Nizami Suleymanov, and several others. 
He would have come to power if he had secured the people's 
support. He was not elected; Elchibey was elected instead. 
Etibar Mamedov moved against him. Later, Elchibey abandoned 
his post. I tried to convince Mamedov to work together with me. 
I invited him, asked him to serve as the republic's foreign 
minister. He refused, saying that the post was not good enough 
for him. I asked him to serve as the state secretary. He did 
not agree to that either. [passage omitted] 
  Etibar Mamedov and Iskendar Khamidov have an agreement to 
wage a struggle against the government now. Who is Iskendar 
Khamidov? That state of affairs is very disgusting for 
Azerbaijan. There is no reason at all for it. Khamidov 
established the party known as Bozkurt. What kind of a party is 
it and where does it find the funds it needs? Khamidov 
disseminated unfounded reports; he committed many crimes in the 
past. He has now moved to organize a meeting. 
  Regarding Isa Kamberov, he got himself appointed chairman of 
the Azerbaijan Supreme Soviet in one way or another. God knows 
whether he got that post through fraud or otherwise. He was 
expected to serve the country, but he abandoned his post. He 
resigned on 11 [month indistinct], saying that he was unable to 
work. Why was he unable to work? Well, they had brought 
Azerbaijan to the verge of civil war. A civil war broke out in 
Azerbaijan. The republic was about to split up. Certain groups 
took action in Ganja, Lenkoran, and Baku. The process of 
fragmentation had begun. Kamberov, who was responsible for 
creating that state of affairs, urged me for three hours to 
travel to Baku to end that state of affairs in the republic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Giorgi Chanturia, chairman of the National- </F>
Democratic Party, by unidentified DRONI correspondent; place and 
date not given: "We Are Coming and Singing"] 
  [Text] There exist differing views in society on how to 
overcome the sociopolitical situation that has taken shape in 
Georgia: Some believe that, in spite of the problems, the 
authorities should see their term of office through to the end; 
here and there in the corridors, they view the use of military 
methods again as a matter of urgency. At the same time, the 
National- Democratic Party [NDP] adheres to a different 
position: the holding of early elections. According to the 
party's leader, Giorgi Chanturia, this already means their 
accession to power. 
  [Chanturia] The NDP has been ready to assume power for a 
long time now. There exists only one way of achieving this aim 
-- elections. However, there is another reason for making this 
demand: One cannot go on living in such a way. Dilettantism has 
destroyed Georgia; Parliament does not resemble a parliament. 
Naturally, the present authorities and their criminal policies 
are the result of its activities. Yet, in the final analysis, 
everything leads us to the electorate: Parliament is composed 
of members chosen by the people. It is possible to make a 
mistake once, twice, three times, but, in the end, we should 
make sure the following French saying does not apply to us: The 
people have the government that they deserve. Opponents are 
demanding the guarantee of a better choice. However, such a 
thing does not exist. This Parliament, in spite of its 
failings, is better than the former Supreme Council. Early 
elections will at once spare us many possible misfortunes. For 
example, military actions, events resembling a palace coup, and 
innumerable other processes. No matter how many Monday 
interviews [reference to Shevardnadze's weekly radio interview] 
and captivating smiles we give, this will not bring any results. 
In spite of their differing views, the people are fed up with 
hearing only that we have overcome provincial fascism; surely we 
should be doing other basic things. However, it is wholly 
impermissible that Eduard Shevardnadze should resign before the 
holding of early elections as he will be replaced by that force 
that is oriented toward Russia and has a lot of weapons and 
money. Of course, such authorities will hold unfair elections 
and we will be needed only to embellish the facade. In this 
case, of course, we will boycott the elections. 
  [DRONI] Does this mean that, if the elections are 
conducted according to the "rules" of another country or if 
there are any military actions, the NDP will adhere to a certain 
neutral position? 
  [Chanturia] When the game is lost, we always remain silent. 
When executive power was recently being ratified anew, the 
majority and minority were summoned and told that, if the 
government should fall, Parliament would be dissolved. Of 
course, we did not determine our position as this would have 
been in vain. At the same time, we did not vote for the 
government. People often talk about the transformation of the 
NDP and its change of position, something which has never 
happened. For example, the severing of relations between us and 
Shevardnadze came about due to a difference of opinion on 
several issues. As soon as he moved into the Russophile camp, 
our ways parted. 
  [DRONI] If a common position is found, do you think it 
will again be possible to cooperate with Eduard 
Shevardnadze? 
  [Chanturia] Naturally, if he conducts the right policies, we 
will support him. However, we will not help anyone to promote a 
Russian policy. I believe that, in spite of Georgia's 
membership in the CIS, Eduard Shevardnadze does not hold a 
pro-Russian stance today. Simply, he did not have enough power: 
The easier it is to free oneself from ideology, the more 
difficult it is to escape a way of life. Shevardnadze believed 
that it was possible to construct the country without any kind 
of team and by giving priority to foreign policy and on the 
basis of his own authority. As can be seen, this has not 
happened. Reforms have also not been carried out and the 
country has been taken over by criminal bands and corruption. 
However, I believe that all possibilities have not yet been 
exhausted. 
  There are fairly powerful pro-Russian forces in Georgia; for 
example, [Parliament Speaker] Goguadze and [Socio-Democratic 
Party Chairman] Muchaidze are struggling against Shevardnadze 
for the reason stated publicly and with typical naivete by 
[ex-Defense Minister] Kitovani: Shevardnadze is not trusted in 
Russia. Incidentally, Muchaidze also said the same thing. Such 
a statement is a criminal offense: To demand the resignation of 
one's own government because it does not meet with the approval 
of a neighboring state. We have another wing as well; I have in 
mind the Liberal-Conservative coalition that apparently 
criticizes the head of state for being a Russophile, but 
believes that Georgia was too late in joining the CIS. A game 
is also being played here. Our politicians have acquired a 
simple understanding of the Russian factor and have formed 
queues in the waiting rooms of various special services in 
Moscow. Frankly speaking, these are agents, and specific 
measures have to be taken against them. 
  [DRONI] Realistically speaking, to what extent was it 
possible to change executive power? In this regard, the general 
secretary of the Union of Georgia's Citizens [Zurab Zhvania] 
stated that not only their union but also other political forces 
were not ready for this change. 
  [Chanturia] In our time, we even proposed to the authorities 
the composition of a coalition government and gave this list to 
Zurab Zhvania. However, for some reason, changes were made to 
it before it was disseminated and the head of state did not 
react to this in any way. The interests of both the majority 
and minority were protected in this proposal and, most 
importantly, a completely different mentality was taken into 
account. 
  [DRONI] Don't you think that the total failure to form 
an opposition played a specific role in the ratification of the 
old government? 
  [Chanturia] We were actually the initiators of a meeting of 
parties following Georgia's entry into the CIS, but several of 
them took such steps that there was no longer any sense even in 
holding consultations. I am surprised that the [Union of] 
Traditionalists agreed to Basilia [one of its members] becoming 
deputy prime minister, especially as they know very well that he 
can do nothing in those conditions when there is no unified 
team. This, in the final analysis, will bring the 
Traditionalists nothing but discredit. 
  [DRONI] The view exists that Basilia's candidacy 
apparently was a unifying force in the matter of ratifying the 
government. 
  [Chanturia] Of course. I do not exclude the existence of 
this factor, but everything was much simpler: It was a matter 
of Traditionalist votes. 
  [DRONI] In your view, apart from the NDP, what other 
political force has the ability to govern the state? 
  [Chanturia] Unfortunately, I cannot see any such serious 
force. I have great respect for the Republicans, but they 
represent more an intellectual association than a party. In 
this respect, the Traditionalists are closer to being a party 
but they are also deficient in many things. The NDP, without 
belonging to any coalition, is able to form a government; this 
team has been in existence for a long time; moreover, we also 
have smaller teams. Incidentally, we viewed the Union of 
Georgia's Citizens with great hope; we thought it could have 
been a worthy opponent, but it has taken the form of neither a 
party nor an organization. 
  [DRONI] If the authorities decide to hold early 
elections, these will not take place before the fall. It is 
possible for the Union of Citizens to form itself into a 
realistic if not dominant force before then. 
  [Chanturia] They have been unable to create structures in 
any region that are better than ours. The fact that they have 
automatically transformed gamgeobebi [local administrative 
boards] into regional organizations of the Union of Citizens 
indicates an antistructural trend, which was the undoing of the 
Popular Front, the Rustaveli Society, and all such mass 
organizations that were created on a tidal wave. 
  [DRONI] In our country, a politician's actions are for 
some reason assessed by the display of positive or negative 
feelings toward him. You stated at a conference that, in order 
to satisfy such feelings, the nation needed a fatherly figure 
and you said that the best example would be a monarchy. If your 
party wins the elections, will this institution be 
introduced? 
  [Chanturia] Of course, the best variant would be to have a 
king, although we are neither republicans nor monarchists. I 
believe that it is altogether too early to speak about the state 
system at the moment as these issues are dependent upon the 
regulation of the Abkhazian and Samachablo [South Ossetia] 
problems; that is to say, the state is dependent upon external 
factors. 
  [DRONI] If the current authorities assume 
responsibility for the prevailing socioeconomic situation and 
the temporary loss of Abkhazia, don't you think that the future 
new authorities will be freed of such a "burden?" 
  [Chanturia] It is impossible to relieve oneself of 
responsibility regarding the Abkhazian question. If the old 
government assumes responsibility for its loss, the problem of 
its return is the prerogative of the new government. However, 
in the socioeconomic sphere, our task will be somewhat lighter. 
The standard of living today is at such a low level that it 
cannot drop any further. This creates a fine background against 
which to conduct reforms. 
  [DRONI] Kalbatoni [Georgian polite form of address] 
Irina Sarishvili [Chanturia's wife, leader of the NDP faction in 
Parliament, former deputy prime minister] has already given an 
assessment of that act that occurred in Parliament [on 28 April, 
deputy speaker Rcheulishvili, after being insulted by Popular 
Front chairman Nodar Natadze, retaliated by splashing a glass of 
mineral water in his face]. Do you think that a crisis in 
Parliament has begun or do you view this as one negative event 
in the life of Parliament? 
  [Chanturia] Naturally, it is very difficult not to excuse 
Rcheulishvili from the human point of view. When you are 
insulted in this way, you can quite easily pour Borzhomi 
[mineral water] over the person and, moreover, hit him over the 
head with the bottle. At the same time, it is very difficult to 
argue against Natadze when his microphone is constantly being 
switched off and when he is being called an idiot or imbecile. 
Quite simply, we are all human beings who, on occasions, are 
capable of losing our tempers. However, we should not view this 
as one normal tense day in the work of Parliament; it is a sign 
of the crisis that has already begun. 
  [DRONI] If the NDP takes part in the future elections, 
what will Giorgi Chanturia personally do? 
  [Chanturia] Basically all those problems that were the 
reason for my not participating in the last elections have been 
removed. In particular, all party structures have been formed, 
which will give powerful assistance to [our] faction. Other 
party leaders have come to the fore, whereas my presence in 
Parliament would have delayed this process. Third, my position 
as a deputy would have resulted in our party losing political 
points. Given that a battle for survival is being waged today, 
I have no right to lock myself up in Diogenes' barrel. 
  [DRONI] However, will Giorgi Chanturia be satisfied 
with being just a deputy? 
  [Chanturia] If the party achieves complete victory, that 
hierarchy that exists in the party will be transferred to the 
state structure.

  [Text] Tallinn, 24 May, BNS -- Estonian Foreign Minister 
Juri Luik will at 6 p.m. today declare open the third session of 
the Council of Baltic Sea Countries foreign ministers. 
  On the agenda are cooperation between Baltic Sea countries 
and the European Union, the work of the council, establishment 
of a secretariat at the council, environmental issues, nuclear 
safety, illegal migration, and organized crime. 
  The session is also expected to approve the mandate of a 
Baltic Sea countries commissioner for national minorities and 
fill the post. The only candidate so far is former Danish 
Justice Minister Ole Espersen. 
  The session ends with the election of the council's new 
president to replace Estonia, who currently holds the body's 
rotating presidency, and adoption of a joint communique. 
  Luik said at a press conference yesterday that the general 
opinion of the Baltic Sea Council member states is the council 
has over the last 14 months "made big strides forward." Luik 
cited as the body's successes the opening of Eurofaculties at 
the Vilnius, Riga, and Tartu universities, the work of the 
council's economics group on the Via Baltica project, and 
achievements in the sphere of nuclear safety. He said the 
implementation of the Via Baltica plan is one of the top 
priorities of the council. 
  Commenting on the mandate of the Baltic Sea countries 
commissioner for human rights and ethnic minorities, the 
Estonian foreign minister emphasized that its primary objective 
is to defend democratic institutions and the rights of 
individuals. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev has previously 
announced Russia intends to raise at the meeting the question of 
the Baltic states' territorial claims on Russia. Luik said at 
the press conference yesterday the issue hasn't as yet been put 
on the agenda. 
  Luik will have during the session private meetings with his 
Russian, Swedish, German and Norwegian counterparts. The 
meeting between Luik and Kozyrev today is regarded as a 
historical event. 
  Luik told reporters the meeting will probably focus on the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia. The Russian foreign 
minister plans also to return to the issuance of residence and 
work permits to Russian military retirees. Moscow insists that 
Estonia should give permanent residence permits to all retired 
officers living here, whereas the Estonian Government and 
delegation for talks with Russia haven't to date acceded to 
Russia's demand. 
  Russia's chief negotiator, Ambassador Vasily Svirin, in an 
interview with BNS yesterday declined to comment on the 
importance of the meeting between Kozyrev and Luik for the 
Estonian-Russian relations. 
  "I hope the meeting will have a positive effect on the 
course 
of the Estonian-Russian negotiations," Svirin told BNS.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin has reaffirmed Moscow's 
position saying that Kiev and Simferopol must refrain from the 
use of force to settle their differences -- in line with CSCE 
principles. His statement came during talks in Moscow on 
Tuesday [24 May] with visiting British Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd who raised the issue. 
  Other issues discussed include European security and 
Russia's 
cooperation with the West including the NATO-sponsored 
Partnership for Peace program. Yeltsin said that both Russia 
and NATO wanted to cooperate with each other, but that this 
cooperation must account for Russia's uniqueness as a great 
power. 
  He is hopeful for a breakthrough in Moscow's talks with the 
European Union and Russia's entry into the world trade 
organization, GATT. 
  Bilateral relations were also discussed by the two men. 
  The Secretary handed Yeltsin a message from Queen Elizabeth 
II saying she accepted an earlier invitation to visit Russia in 
autumn, it is to be the first such visit to Russia by a British 
monarch. 
  On Tuesday morning, Viktor Chernomyrdin and British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd discussed relations between Russia and 
Ukraine in light of the situation in Crimea. 
  Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, who took 
part in the talks, told reporters that Chernomyrdin had 
expressed the conviction that there were no insoluble problems 
in Russian-Ukrainian relations. He also said that the two 
states could reach agreement on the basis of the accord on the 
division of the Black Sea Fleet, signed by Boris Yeltsin and 
Leonid Kravchuk last March. 
  Chernomyrdin also confirmed that Crimea was part of Ukraine 
and that Russia respected Ukraine's territorial integrity. 
  To quote Churkin, Chernomyrdin assured Hurd that no force 
would be used in tackling political problems. 
  "Confrontation with Ukraine is unthinkable," said 
Chernomyrdin. "All problems that have arisen or will arise will 
be tackled in the spirit of cooperation," he added. 
  Russia insists only on political settlement between Kiev and 
Simferopol, Chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Information 
and Press Department Grigoriy Karasin stated at a briefing in 
Moscow Tuesday. 
  He confirmed that the position of Russia towards the 
sovereign Republic of Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine 
remained the same and was well known to the Ukrainian 
leadership. He stressed that it was necessary to observe 
territorial integrity and inviolability of the existing borders. 
Karasin said it was also very important to respect the 
sovereign will of nations. He emphasized that the parties must 
refrain from the use of force. 
  He said Russia was concerned over tension in bilateral 
relations which might emerge due to Crimea. He emphasized that 
the discord between Kiev and Simferopol was a domestic Ukrainian 
affair. "However, certain Ukrainian politicians are trying to 
lay all responsibility at the door of `some external forces' 
meaning Russia," Karasin pointed out. 
  The situation in Crimea once again proves that the 
key-issues 
of Russian-Ukrainian relations must be solved urgently, he said. 
  Karasin added that the current Russian-Ukrainian talks in 
Moscow were focusing on these issues rather than on Crimea.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kuzmin] </F>
  [Text] Vienna 25 May TASS -- The situation in the Crimea 
was discussed at a session of the standing committee of the 
Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe here on 
Wednesday [25 May]. 
  According to diplomatic circles, it was acting chairman of 
the standing committee -- the main CSCE body for holding 
political consultations -- who proposed to consider the issue at 
the session. 
  Representatives of 17 countries took part in the discussion 
on the Crimean issue. According to a Russian delegate, the 
Russian position in respect of the sovereign republic of Crimea, 
a constituent part of Ukraine, has not changed. Such legal 
principles of CSCE, as territorial integrity and inviolability 
of existing borders, should be observed when trying to settle 
the problem. It is necessary to exclude resorting to force or 
threats to resort to forceful methods in attempt to solve 
emerging political problems. 
  The participants also discussed a draft resolution of the 
CSCE standing committee and decided to postpone its adoption on 
Thursday. 
  The draft resolution focusses attention on the role CSCE may 
play in preventing further aggravation of the conflict in view 
of the current situation in Crimea and available opportunities 
for a peaceful settlement of disputable issues.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Konovalov: "NATO Joins in Conversion"] </F>
  [Text] The International symposium on the conversion of 
concentrated energy systems -- powder, solid propellants for 
missiles, explosives, and pyrotechnic mixtures -- has ended in 
Moscow. This was the first time that scientists from the East 
and the West, among them representatives of NATO's scientific 
committee, had worked together at such a forum. 
  "If someone had told me five years ago that I would be in 
Moscow discussing problems of the peaceful use of secret rocket 
fuels with Russians, that would have seemed pure fantasy," Dr. 
H. Krause, a member of that committee, told me. 
  Professor H. Schubert, one of the organizers of the 
symposium, stressed that the exchange of experience and ideas in 
this sphere is extremely useful -- mountains of weapons have 
been stockpiled and represent a great danger. From time to time 
these weapons remind you of their presence with colossal 
explosions endangering the population and the natural 
environment. However, the reports delivered by academicians B. 
Zhukov, G. Sakovich, and V. Tartakovskiy, Professor Yu. Frolov, 
and many others showed that an explosive that has become surplus 
to requirements can be of use to people. 
  TNT, for example, can be used to produce polymer film and 
artificial diamonds can be made from substandard powder. Powder 
charges can be used in magnetohydrodynamic generators, which in 
turn can be used to detect mineral deposits and increase the 
accuracy of long-term earthquake forecasting. Converted 
missiles can be used in reverse to drill bore holes. It is 
surprising but true that even fires can be put out using powder 
charges, which release flame-extinguishing aerosols from the 
warhead casings. These casings can be fired straight from a 
grenade launcher through the window of a blazing apartment to 
put out a fire. 
  These are many examples of this kind but they require prior 
scientific research work which is, unfortunately costly. Here, 
too, cooperation with the West could prove highly useful.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Banting] </F>
  [Text] Hiroshima May 25 TASS -- Tajikistan and Uzbekistan 
will be visited this week by U.N. Assistant Secretary-General 
Marrack Goulding. He will hold talks with the prime ministers 
of the two republics, will hand over to the Tajik Government a 
message from the U.N. secretary-general. This news was 
furnished to ITAR-TASS by Marrack Goulding, who is now attending 
a U.N. conference on disarmament here. 
  Goulding bluntly refused to disclose the contents of Butrus 
Ghali's message, but noted that it was devoted to the political 
situation in Tajikistan and to the settlement of the existing 
differences between the Tajik Government and the opposition. 
Goulding's visit to Tajikistan will take place on the eve of the 
multilateral consultations on the situation in that republic, 
which are expected to begin on June 4. 
  Goulding spoke highly about Russia's efforts to settle the 
conflict in Tajikistan. "Moscow is rendering the most vigorous 
support to the U.N. efforts to achieve a settlement in that 
republic," he stated. 
  The U.N. assistant secretary-general ruled out the 
possibility of U.N. peace-making forces being sent to the 
republics of the former USSR. "We regard the achievement of 
political concord between the conflcting groups as an 
indispensable precondition for this," he stated. "But there is 
no such precondition in any of the republics, including Georgia, 
which urges us to send our troops to Abkhazia. Therefore," 
Goulding pointed out, "we welcome Russia's full-scale 
participation in the settlement of inter-ethnic conflicts in the 
former USSR, and we believe it is very important to ensure close 
cooperation between the United Nations and Moscow in this 
effort." 
  Chief of the analysis and forecasts department of the 
Russian 
Foreign Ministry Ednan Agayev, who is attending the U.N. 
conference in Hiroshima, told ITAR-TASS that he welcomed 
Goulding's visit to Tajikistan. He expressed the hope that this 
would contribute to more active U.N. participation in the effort 
to settle the conflict in that republic. "Unfortunately, the 
U.N. still does not display any readiness to assume a greater 
share of the responsibility for this effort. It is adhering to 
a passive stand," he noted.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 25, BNS -- The chiefs of Estonian, 
Latvian and Lithuanian Air Forces agreed to cooperate in 
controlling air space and training pilots. 
  According to an agreement signed Tuesday [24 May] at the 
Meskuciai air base in Lithuania, the three nations intend to 
create a joint system of air space control. 
  Baltic defense officials say the plan has a number of 
technical and financial advantages, especially considering 
intentions to join NATO structures. 
  Supposedly, a Baltic air space control system can be created 
in 5 to 10 years. 
  During talks in Meskuciai, the three countries agreed to 
create a joint pilot training center in Lithuania. On 
Wednesday, Estonian Air Force pilots flew their first training 
flights on Lithuanian planes. 
  Lithuania's Air Force is considered the strongest among the 
Baltic states with its four Czech-made jet fighters L-39, two 
transport planes L-41, which were donated by the German 
Government, and several Soviet-made AN-2 biplanes. 
  Two Lithuanian L-39's and one helicopter will participate in 
celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the Latvian Air Force in 
Riga Saturday. The celebration will also be attended by a 
Lithuanian delegation, headed by the acting Air Force Chief, 
Colonel Stasys Murza.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 25, BNS -- Estonian Environment 
Minister Andres Tarand and Lauri Vaarja, the general director of 
the Fishing Department, returned today from Sweden where they 
attended a fishing conference of the Baltic coast nations. On 
the agenda of the conference were the situation with the stocks 
of fish, fishing statistics and exchange of information. 
  The meeting discussed the decline in the stocks of cod in 
the 
Baltic and the need to improve statistics on cod fishing, as 
well as diseases of Baltic salmon and the possibility of joint 
reasearch into their reasons. 
  Vaarja reported to the meeting on Estonian statistics 
concerning stocks of fish, noting that collecting complete 
overall statistics is difficult, since the task of amassing data 
has been laid on local governments. 
  The participants decided that, in order to improve catch 
statistics, the Baltic Sea states should exchange information 
about all fishing vessels that put in at their ports and prevent 
illicit port visits. 
  Tarand said in an interview with BNS that coordinating 
cooperation between Baltic coast nations on the level of prime 
ministers is one of the opportunities to improve information 
exchange. 
  The meeting in Sweden also touched upon the stock of seals 
in 
the Baltic. Although seals pose a threat to fish, they are in 
jeopardy themselves due to environmental pollution. 
  The next fishing conference was set for the beginning of 
1995.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaly Trubetskoi, and others] 
  [Text] The Russian delegation expressed its deep concern 
over the situation in the sphere of human rights in Estonia at 
the Third Conference of Foreign Ministers of Member-States of 
the Baltic Sea States Council in Tallinn. 
  The memorandum circulated at the conference, underlined that 
establishment of an independent Estonian state was going hand in 
hand with pushing the non-Estonian population out of the 
country. The document emphasized that Estonia had adopted and 
was implementing several laws discriminating against the 
Russian- speaking population in Estonia. In particular, this 
meant the law on citizenship, depriving a third of the 
population of citizenship, the law on language, hampering 
employment of ethnic Russians, the law on local elections, which 
does not admit the election of non- citizens and the law on 
aliens which made many Estonian permanent residents foreigners 
in their own country. There is also a law on schools limiting 
studies in Russian to the first nine years of secondary 
education. 
  The Russian delegation suggested that the recommendations by 
international experts, including the CSCE and Council of Europe 
High Commissioner for Ethnic Minorities, had not been taken into 
consideration when adopting these laws. The document also 
stressed that implementation of the legislation was left to the 
arbitrary whims of officials. The Estonian authorities fail to 
display any appropriate response to this, the document said. 
  Russia proceeds from the fact that the legal rights of the 
non- ethnic population in Estonia and settlement of their civil 
status concerns not only Russian-Estonian relations but the 
whole world community, the document underlined. 
  The Russian delegation circulated one more memorandum urging 
the participants in the council to work on projects for 
development of infrastructure and transport in the region, to 
coordinate improvement of navigation on the Baltic Sea and 
modernization of sea ports and to facilitate business and other 
contacts. 
  Much attention was paid to social and economic development 
of 
the Kaliningrad Region. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is concerned over 
the activities of the Baltic Sea States' Council which he has 
estimated as not so effective. 
  Speaking at the third conference of foreign ministers of the 
council, which unites ten states of the region, Kozyrev wished 
that activities of the council would be more concrete; 
particularly as concerned cooperation in the humanitarian sphere 
and human rights. 
  Kozyrev submitted to Estonian Foreign Minister Yuriy Luik a 
letter on the part of Russian retired servicemen revealing 
concrete examples of violations of their human rights. The 
letter said that elderly people older than 60 were demanded to 
present medical documents confirming they were free from AIDS or 
venereal diseases and that military pensioners were deprived of 
free medical care. 
  Kozyrev suggested that the commissioner for democratic 
institutions and human rights could be charged with such issues. 
Kozyrev hoped that the commissioner would also control the 
situation with the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic 
states. Russia would assist the commissioner with his 
activities on Russian territory, Kozyrev stated. He announced 
that Russia approved of the candidacy of well known Danish 
politician, former minister of justice Ole Espersen. 
  Kozyrev spoke in favor of cooperation between the members of 
the council in the sphere of infrastructure and transport and 
between different regions of the member-states. He spoke for 
the future chairmen of the council to be more energetic and 
efficient. Kozyrev supported the candidacy of Poland as the 
head of the organization for the next year.

<F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F>
Albert Maloveryan] 
  [Text] Tallinn, 25 May -- The withdrawal of troops from 
Estonia must be carried out on the basis of a treaty, as is 
being done in Latvia and Lithuania. Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev stated this today at a news conference on the 
results of a ministerial session of the Council of Baltic Sea 
States [CBSS]. 
  Russia, he continued, did not send troops to Estonia, but it 
cannot leave them to their fate. The situation in former 
Yugoslavia shows what could have been the result of such an 
action. The responsibility for the troop contingent in the 
Baltic countries, which Russia has taken upon herself, also 
includes social guarantees for servicemen. "We discussed these 
questions with President Lennart Meri and Foreign Minister Juri 
Luik," Kozyrev said, "and soon we will have a legal basis for 
troop withdrawal." The head of the Russian foreign affairs 
department stressed the necessity of settling the problem of 
military pensioners. He reminded everyone that on the previous 
day he gave Juri Luik a letter from one of the groups of former 
servicemen. "We cannot ignore the situation these people are 
in," the minister noted. 
  Juri Luik stated in turn that the Estonian side now has more 
ground for hope that the troop issue will be settled. The 
withdrawal of the troop contingent and the issue of the military 
pensioners are two parallel problems which should not be linked 
to each other, but they must be settled, he said. 
  A question was also put to the Russian minister concerning 
the "sharp tone" of the memorandum on the situation of the 
Russophone population in Estonia. " We are looking for friendly, 
goodneighborly relations with Estonia, and this implies the 
settling of issues mentioned in the memorandum," he answered. 
Further, touching upon the problem of border disputes, Kozyrev 
stated that this subject was not discussed within the framework 
of the present CBSS session. He added that if it had, it would 
have been like opening "Pandora's box," and once again pointed 
to the Yugoslav situation. 
  The Estonian side, on the other hand, is in favor of 
discussing the border issue. Juri Luik said at the news 
conference that Tallinn intends to raise this question at the 
forthcoming Paris conference on the stability in Europe pact. 
  Andrey Kozyrev, summing up the whole CBSS ministerial 
session, repudiated the claims of those politicians who think 
that all problems can be settled immediately. "We are acting on 
a stage-by- stage basis and are moving toward our goal," the 
Russian minister said. He said that setting up the post of 
commissar for human rights and ethnic minorities was one of the 
most important decisions of the meeting. In particular, his job 
will include seeing that the rights of the Russophone population 
in the Baltic countries are observed.

  [Text] The third session of the Council of the Baltic Sea 
States foreign ministers ended at noon today. At the close of 
the session the foreign ministers adopted a joint communique in 
which they note with satisfaction that political and economic 
relations between the countries on the Baltic Sea have advanced 
considerably. The foreign ministers are satisfied with the 
agreements between the European Union [EU], Finland, Sweden, and 
Norway as well as with the association agreement between the EU 
and Poland. The ministers are also in support of the free trade 
talks between the Baltic countries and the EU and hope that the 
EU and Russia will conclude a friendship and cooperation 
agreement in the near future. 
  In their joint communique, the foreign ministers welcome the 
political and economic changes in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Poland, and Russia. They also emphasize the importance of the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Lithuania and the importance 
of the troop withdrawal agreement concluded between Latvia and 
Russia. The foreign ministers repeated their call for foreign 
troops to be withdrawn from Estonia and Latvia, swiftly, 
completely, and in an orderly manner. 
  The foreign ministers considered it highly necessary to make 
cooperation on transport and power engineering more effective 
between the member states and emphasized the importance of sea 
transport and the development of ports. The communique also 
emphasized the need to strengthen nuclear safety within the 
Baltic basin, and supported the proposal of the working group on 
nuclear and radiation safety attached to the Council of the 
Baltic Sea States, to provide technical and legal assistance to 
the dismantlement of the Russian nuclear reactors located at 
Paldiski.
