<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "PvdA Banks on Prime Ministership in </F>
Cabinet With D66"] 
  [Text] Amsterdam -- The PvdA [Labor Party] is counting on 
gaining influence now that it has become the biggest party in 
the country. The loss in votes compared to the parliamentary 
elections of four and one-half years ago is significantly large. 
But on Tuesday evening [3 May], leading figures in the party 
referred to the possibility that the PvdA would provide the 
prime minister for a new cabinet consisting of the progressive 
majority together with D66 [Democrats 66]. 
  For that reason, T. Woeltgens, the former chairman of the 
Parliamentary Party, spoke of a "victorious defeat." He said 
that the situation was the opposite to that in 1986, when the 
PvdA gained five seats but could not win governmental power. 
The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], which at the time made 
bigger gains than the PvdA, continued to govern with the VVD 
[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]. Since then, the 
PvdA has regarded 1986 as an "election defeat." 
  Jacques Wallage, the PvdA's second in command, cautiously 
anticipated that his party's defeat will be of lesser importance 
for the formation of government. Not only because the PvdA was 
the biggest party, but also because "there has been a 
fragmentation of both the Left and the Right." Wallage also 
counted on close cooperation with D66 in the formation of a new 
cabinet. 
  Interior Minister Van Thijn said that it was "virtually 
inevitable" that Wim Kok would become the new prime minister. 
"There are three reasons for that," he said, counting them off 
on his fingers. 
  "One: the PvdA is the biggest party. Two: in opinion polls 
a majority of the people have always indicated that they saw Kok 
as their preferred candidate. Three: no one else is such an 
old hand at politics as Kok." 
  Woeltgens referred to the past again when he said that Kok 
had a good chance of getting the highest office. "In 1973, Den 
Uyl became prime minister even though the PvdA was smaller than 
the Christian parties," he said. 
  No PvdA leader could be tempted into making quick comments 
about the combination of parties necessary to form a new 
cabinet. Van Thijn, known for his role as negotiator in the 
1977 cabinet formation, does not expect "the formation process 
to last long. But the problem in the formation is that it will 
be a three-party cabinet." 
  Like Wallage, Woeltgens, and Kok, he is assuming that the 
PvdA will work with D66 and choose the CDA or VVD as a third 
party. Both possibilities are acceptable, as long as agreement 
on programs can be reached, it is said. 
  It is not clear to everyone within the PvdA whether such a 
cabinet could be called left wing. Paul Kalma, a member of the 
PvdA's scientific bureau, said that "the Left as a whole has 
lost." 
  He referred to the results of his own party and those of 
Green Left, and apparently concluded that the gains of D66 were 
an insufficient counterbalance. Woeltgens left the question 
unresolved, saying that "D66 calls itself progressive in any 
case." 
  Cooperation and Development Minister Jan Pronk refused to be 
dragged along by the euphoric mood among his colleagues. "Kok 
as prime minister?" he said. "Something like that must be 
decided in the negotiations. It could be more difficult than 
many people think at present." 
  Nor would Pronk hazard any predictions about the 
configuration of the new cabinet and whether the "progressive 
bloc" of the PvdA and D66, which his colleagues are talking 
about, could dominate such a cabinet. "Every combination is 
possible," he said. "Especially now that the four biggest 
parties do not differ in size from one another so much." 
  Will the CDA be able to content itself with a subordinate 
role in a cabinet where D66 and the PvdA form the majority? 
Outgoing Minister Van Thijn did not want to talk in terms of 
subordinate or dominant. 
  Separately from that question, he regarded the psychological 
objections in the CDA as not insurmountable. "The present 
political leaders take a business-like attitude," he said. 
"They can make quick decisions." 
  The theoretical possibility that the AOV [General 
Association 
of Elderly People] could play a role in the upcoming government 
formation is regarded as small. "You do not veto anything in 
advance," Wallage said, "but a cabinet has to make decisions 
about many things. A party which represents only one interest 
does not fit logically."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "D66 Finds It Has at Last Become a </F>
Major Party -- Double Number of Seats Unleashes Euphoria Among 
Leadership"] 
  [Excerpt] The Hague -- On Tuesday evening [3 May], in the 
Krasnapolsky Hotel in Amsterdam, the same venue where the party 
was formed 28 years ago, D66 [Democrats 66] leader Hans Van 
Mierlo made an American-style victory gesture to the vociferous 
jubilation of his supporters. Raising both his arms and holding 
them wide apart above his head he said: "We have done it. We 
have become a major party." 
  In a single bound, the D66 doubled its vote. Consequently, 
the D66 party in the Second Chamber will now make an historic 
leap forward, from 12 to 24 seats. Never in its history had the 
party earned more than 17 seats. 
  Referring to the opinion polls, which for months had been 
dubbing the party for victory, Van Mierlo said: "From the 
promised land we have arrived in the land of reality." 
  Week after week, that promise implied more than the result 
which ultimately emerged from the elections. At its highest 
point in the polls, the party scored 34 seats in the Chamber. 
  Only a few weeks ago, there was careful speculation about 
the 
possibility of Van Mierlo's party becoming the largest in the 
country. And on the morning of the elections, the democrats 
still rated 27 seats in the opinion polls. 
  The outcome of the election, according to Van Mierlo, 
constituted "an historic disaster for government policy." He 
also viewed the result as a signal for change, saying: "Now at 
last there is talk of an unprecedented shift in Netherlands 
politics. This is highly significant. And it is an historic 
victory for a party that during its 28-year existence has always 
called for renewal. We will make the most of the situation." 
  By the way, Van Mierlo is sticking firmly to his preference 
for a purple coalition, a government comprised of the PvdA 
[Labor Party], VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], 
and D66. The D66 leader responded cautiously to the question of 
whether it was inevitable that PvdA leader Kok, the head of the 
largest party in the country, would become the new prime 
minister. "It would be the first time that a party which 
incurred such a loss would provide the prime minister," said Van 
Mierlo. "On the other hand, Kok certainly has what it takes to 
become prime minister." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Co Welgraven: "Crucial Role Is for Biggest </F>
Winner"] 
  [Text] Following the sensational election result, a 
government of the CDA [Christian Democrat Appeal], PvdA [Labor 
Party], and the Elderly People's Party is, in theory, possible. 
This gray coalition can count on a slight majority with 78 
seats. The CDA and VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy] managed to survive for four years, from 1977 to 1981, 
with one less seat, so why not? 
  There is no shortage of alternatives. But many are not 
realistic and have already been ruled out by those in question. 
This is true, for example, of a national government of the four 
major parties. 
  What is sure is that any majority government must include 
three parties. A coalition goverment of only two parties is out 
of the question. More than anything else, this shows the 
weakened position of the CDA, which has been used to governing 
alternatively with the PvdA and the VVD. 
  Reasonably sure, too, is that the D66 [Democrats 66] is 
going 
to play a crucial role in the formation of any new government. 
A government which does not include Hans Van Mierlo's party is 
virtually inconceivable. In this respect, the position of the 
D66 is in theory stronger than that of the three other major 
parties. 
  There are in fact just three serious possibilities. The 
least probable is a government of the Right including the CDA, 
VVD and D66, which would have 89 seats in Parliament. For 
tactical reasons, however, Van Mierlo is reluctant to exclude 
this option, but it is difficult to imagine that the D66, which 
is constantly pressing for government reform, will be prepared 
to go down in history as the party which assisted a majority 
government of the Right. This would most probably annul 
yesterday's gains at future elections, at the very least. The 
party still remembers how the electorate judged the summer 
government of the CDA and D66 back in 1982. 
  That leaves two options. One is the purple coalition of the 
PvdA, VVD, and D66. Such a government would have a solid 
parliamentary majority with 92 seats. Finally, there is the 
center-left option, with a government of the PvdA, CDA, and D66 
with 95 seats. 
  It is still going to be difficult to choose. The D66 is a 
great supporter of a purple coalition and this party's opinion, 
which was the big winner at the elections, naturally carries a 
great deal of weight. 
  The advantage of such a purple coalition is that it would 
also include the election runner-up, the VVD. During the 
election campaign, VVD leader Bolkestein already stated that the 
two winners should sit together in a future government. He left 
the question open as to whether the third party should be the 
CDA or the PvdA. 
  The advantage for the CDA as a non-participating party is 
that it could seek the shelter of the opposition ranks in order 
to solve its leadership crisis. With a loss of 20 seats and a 
discredited party leader, its further participation in the 
government, as if nothing had happened, would be difficult to 
justify. 
  The disadvantages of a purple coalition, however, are just 
as 
numerous. There are a number of major problems in terms of 
political programs. How will the PvdA and the VVD be able 
bridge their differences on the future of the social security 
system? And what about the conflict over education for illegal 
immigrants? Bolkestein has already made it clear that these are 
subjects which must be discussed. 
  A center-left government of the CDA, PvdA, and D66 seems 
somewhat easier. The differences, in particular in the 
financial-economic area, are not insurmountable. The D66 will 
want the concession from the PvdA that the social security 
system is not sacrosanct. But is a government of three parties 
in which two of the parties suffered serious losses at the polls 
really acceptable? The CDA and PvdA together have lost a total 
of 32 seats, a loss on an unprecedented scale. 
  The PvdA has the trump card as the biggest party. It will 
probably be given the first initiative [to form a government]. 
But probably not alone. Also in the game is D66. It is still 
possible that two persons, one from the PvdA as the largest 
party and one from the D66 as the winning party, will be 
designated to test the ground for the formation of a government. 
  They would first of all look at the possibilities for a 
purple coalition. This would appeal to the D66 in particular, 
which would certainly make concessions to its program to achieve 
it. A purple government is Hans Van Mierlo's dream. 
  His PvdA colleague Kok is much less enthusiastic, but cannot 
quickly disregard the possibility. To reject it would 
automatically mean bringing in the Christian Democrats and 
giving them a trump card to play, because the CDA also knows 
that, if a purple coalition does not work, the PvdA has only one 
other remaining option: a center-left government. Moreover, in 
such negotiations, the D66 is likely to adopt a much tougher 
stance than in a purple coalition. The party has repeatedly 
stated that it will not simply fall into line with the CDA and 
PvdA. 
  Whichever of these two coalitions will actually come to 
power, one of the bizarre results of these elections may be that 
the man who has imposed two legislative election defeats on the 
PvdA and who has brought it to a an all-time electoral low may 
well become the first social democrat prime minister for 17 
years.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Wio Joustra: "Brinkman's Fall Probably Due </F>
to Excessively Early Launch"] 
  [Excerpts] Is the role of CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] 
leader Elco Brinkman over? At one time he was the most popular 
politician in the country. That is because in the Netherlands, 
popularity is synonymous with fame. And Mr. Leendert Cornelis 
(Elco) Brinkman was a famous Netherlander as minister of 
welfare, public health, and culture in the Lubbers I and II 
cabinet. The most junior member of those cabinets, he was only 
34 in 1982, he always sought publicity. [passage omitted] 
  Exactly 10 years ago this week, he showed his contempt for 
the parliament during an interview, casting serious doubts on 
the functioning of the Chamber, "Sometimes, the parliament is 
like one big clique," he said. 
  The question is whether Brinkman will continue to constitute 
part of this clique for much longer. Can a political leader 
whose party has plunged from a representation of 54 seats to the 
dramatic low-point in CDA history of 34 seats stay on as leader? 
  In the speech he gave upon hearing of his defeat, a deeply 
dejected Brinkman gave no indication of whether he blamed 
himself for the result. The possibility of a "putsch," maybe 
inspired by the Catholics, cannot be ruled out. The party could 
have swallowed losing 10 seats. The "Lubbers effect" was worth 
the same amount. And after the Arscop affair (joining the board 
of Uncle Arie's company), their representation dropped to 40 
seats. But 34, a loss of 20 seats? 
  How did the bright and brilliant young man of the CDA come 
to 
fall so far? Certainly, Brinkman was put, maybe 
unintentionally, under considerable pressure by the outgoing 
prime minister. Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers recently admitted 
in his own words that he had launched his crown prince much too 
early. As a result, Brinkman found himself in an impossible 
position as party leader. 
  On the one hand, he had to support the CDA/PvdA [Labor 
Party] 
coalition; on the other, he had to profile himself as the future 
leader who wished to distance himself from policy that had 
become adrift, and frequently gave the impression that he would 
much rather team up with the VVD [People's Party of Freedom and 
Democracy] than with the PvdA. Which almost succeeded in the 
WAO [Law on Labor Disability] affair, about pensions. 
  The Brinkman shuffle was suspected by show-off Frits Wester 
and on Monday [2 May] it was announced that he had left the 
ship. This marked the start of an old-fashioned American 
campaign aimed at stepping cleanly into the shoes of Lubbers, as 
leader of the largest party, with nobody able to ignore his 
claim to the prime minister's job. However, what may have been a 
dream turned into a nightmare in which Brinkman himself again, 
Lubbers and Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin commanded the 
rather unedifying main roles.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ruehe: Don't Lift Weapons Embargo </F>
Against Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Volker Ruehe has warned the United 
States against a premature unilateral lifting of the arms 
embargo vis-a-vis the Bosnian Government. Ruehe said in 
Washington that he would consider that to be a wrong move. 
Concerning the U.S. Congress and its efforts to lift the 
embargo, he said the United States and Europe must not diverge 
on this issue. The main objective, he said, is to prevent the 
Bosnian war from spreading to other localities, and to set the 
peace process in motion once again. 
  The war in the Balkans was one of the main topics of Ruehe's 
talks with U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and acting 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. In their discussion about 
the situation in the Balkans, the interlocutors agreed that 
despite the threatened use of air strikes, the attempt to subdue 
the Serbs had not succeeded. The U.S. Department of Defense 
does not consider the use of air strikes a suitable method of 
proving the West's assertiveness indefinitely. As for the 
deployment of land forces, there is no public approval for such 
an idea, and no peace plan supported by at least one of the 
parties to the Balkan conflict. In addition, such an operation 
would create more victims than the Gulf war. 
  Ruehe indicated that one was now going to consider ways of 
meeting halfway Serbian attempts to use a kind of evasive action 
in order to spread the war to other areas. He did not wish to 
divulge any details, but observers think he meant an expansion 
of the safety zone. A high-ranking Pentagon employee said now 
is a good time for diplomatic steps to be made, because the 
Russians have lost their patience with the Serbs and the siege 
of Gorazde has revealed to the Muslims the military weaknesses 
of the Serbs. But the American side expressed concern about the 
restricted military maneuvering space. It was said that the 
threat of air strikes already represents a high degree of 
military pressure that can hardly be exceeded. What else, it 
was asked, can be achieved on a military level if the Serbs 
withstand a bombardment? 
  The politicians discussed at length NATO cooperation with 
Russia, and hoped that Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev 
will sign the Partnership for Peace agreement when he visits 
NATO headquarters in Brussels at the end of May. NATO's offer 
of cooperation is receiving various reviews in Moscow. Plans 
for a Russian-American joint maneuver this year are not 
receiving further consideration for the time being. 
  Ruehe explained to his interlocutors his plans for the 
restructuring of the Bundeswehr, and encountered approval. 
Defense Secretary Perry supported his plan to reduce the 
personnel level of the army, before a "hollow army" emerges. 
Apart from that, said Ruehe, for the sake of future Bundeswehr 
tasks, it is important to establish strong and efficient 
crisis-reaction forces. Ruehe explained that as a result of the 
Constitutional Court's ruling, the restructuring of the army 
could now be planned. But according to the Pentagon, the 
reduction of European armies makes it difficult to justify to 
Congress the presence of 100,000 American soldiers in Europe. 
In any case, the U.S. Government is not considering any 
reduction in U.S. troops in Europe.

  [Excerpt] Yesterday in Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and a 
European Jewish Congress delegation led by Congress Chairman 
Jean Kahn discussed measures to combat xenophobia and racism. 
The delegation expressed its great concern over the growing 
excesses in Germany. Kohl said the federation and laender were 
doing everything in their power to combat such activities. 
  The chancellor added that on a European Union level, the 
German Government would call for the adoption of "common 
measures against extremism and xenophobia." Kohl and the 
delegation agreed that in this respect, particular attention 
should be paid to "the system of upbringing in all European 
countries." Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Jewish 
Council in Germany, and Israel Singer, general secretary of the 
World Jewish Congress, also took part in the meeting.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Federal Government today 
confirmed its support for the Baltic states in their attempts to 
achieve a closer relationship with the European Union [EU], and 
stressed those countries' function as a bridge between East and 
West Europe. In talks with Lithuanian Premier Adolfas 
Slezevicius, who arrived in Bonn today on a visit, Federal 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel stressed that Germany sees itself 
as the advocate of Lithuania and the other two Baltic states in 
their efforts to find a way into the European and transatlantic 
structures. It is also in the Federal Republic's interests to 
introduce Lithuania as quickly as possible to the EU, the WEU 
[Western European Union], and NATO, Kinkel said. The foreign 
minister stressed that developing the Baltic states' relations 
with the EU will be an important element of the German 
presidency of the EU, beginning in July. 
  In a separate meeting with the Lithuanian premier, Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt referred to the Baltic states' bridging 
role between West and East Europe, and described the 
negotiations on a free trade agreement between Lithuania and the 
EU, with the prosepct of association and entry, as "an important 
step." In his talk with the premier and Industry and Trade 
Minister Karzimieras Klimasauskas, Rexrodt also underscored 
Lithuania's successful efforts in tackling the process of 
political and economic transformation. The Lithuanian side 
praised Germany's support in the negotiations with the EU and 
the advice given to the government in Vilnius on developing a 
market economy. 
  Apart from the "good state of bilateral relations," a 
"generally gratifying" development of trade between the two 
states, with a volume of around 820 million German marks was 
noted. Germany is Lithuania's most important trading partner 
with a 17 percent share of Lithuania's foreign trade. There are 
already around 500 joint ventures, especially in the textiles 
industry, agriculture, and engineering.

  [Text] Bonn, May 4 (YONHAP) -- Visiting South Korean 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae conferred with his German 
counterpart, Minister Volker Ruehe, here Wednesday [4 May] and 
they agreed on stepped-up military exchanges and cooperation 
between their countries. 
  The two ministers in particular shared the view that the 
North Korean nuclear question is the factor of major threat to 
stability in Northeast Asia let alone the Korean peninsula and 
that Pyongyang's nuclear development should be thwarted by all 
means. 
  During the meeting held at the German Defense Ministry, the 
two ministers adopted a joint statement on the promotion of 
defense and military exchanges and cooperation. 
  The statement called for the diversification of bilateral 
policy and strategic dialogues and expansion of mutual 
cooperation in easing tension in disputed areas. 
  Defense sources said the statement was significant in that 
it 
is the first document Germany adopted with a non-NATO member 
country for expanded cooperation in the defense area. 
  The statement specifically featured mutual consultations on 
basic defense and military policies, exchanges of information 
and personnel, and stepped-up cooperation in defense industry, 
education and training. 
  Minister Yi is expected to visit the German Eastern Corps 
Headquarters and Berlin on Thursday before leaving for Seoul.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has 
expressed pleasure at the "overwhelming approval" by the 
European Parliament of the entry of Austria, Sweden, Finland, 
and Norway into the European Union [EU]. A further great and 
important step toward the enlargement of the EU has been taken, 
Kinkel said in Bonn on Wednesday [3 May]. Kinkel said he is 
confident that the last hurdles will also now be overcome and 
that the referenda and ratification processes in the individual 
states will be brought to a brisk and positive conclusion. 
Kinkel stressed that the Federal Government will do everything 
to ensure the treaties of accession were ratified in good time 
in Germany, so that the four European Free Trade Association 
states will become equal members of the EU on 1 January next 
year.

<F P=106> ["df"-signed report: "In the Future, Bonn Wants More Money </F>
Back From Europe"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 3 May -- In 1994, the Federal Republic 
of Germany will pay an estimated 44.2 billion German marks [DM] 
to the EU budget; of this sum, DM8.7 billion will go to the EU's 
traditional own resources (customs and levies), DM23.3 billion 
to value-added tax funds, and DM12.2 billion to GNP funds. 
German payments to the "European Development Fund" (Lome 
Agreement), which is financed outside the EU budget through 
payments from member states, will presumably amount to DM913 
billion [as published] in 1994. 
  This is what the Federal Finance Ministry says in its answer 
to a written question in the Bundestag (printed matter 12/7296). 
The ministry gives a detailed explanation of the legal and 
technical bases for the financing of the EU budget by the member 
states. 
  The German payment obligation results from the EC Council 
decision of 24 June 1988 on the system of the Community's own 
resources, which was ratified by the Bundestag on 20 December 
1988. 
  This decision on the financing of the EU budget envisages 
maximum EU resources totalling 1.20 percent of the annual GNP at 
market prices in the Community. 
  This quota is achieved by means of the following revenue 
procedures: In addition to its traditional own resources 
(customs and levies), to which the Community is basically 
entitled, the Community can access the revenue from the 
value-added tax (value-added tax funds) up to 1.4 percent of the 
"standard assessment basis." 
  This assessment basis corresponds to the sum of all sales at 
final consumption level that are taxable under Community laws. 
The methods of calculation are the same for all member states 
and are stipulated in an EEC directive. According to the 
Federal Finance Ministry, they are undisputed in substance. 
  The Commission and the Court of Auditors of the European 
Community have to supervise the standardized calculation of the 
value-added tax assessment basis by all member states. This has 
probably not always been sufficiently done in the past. 
However, the Federal Government now sees an "increasing 
improvement." 
  The value-added tax assessment basis is only considered up 
to 
a maximum 55 percent of GNP, however. This lower rate was 
introduced above all in response to criticism of economically 
weaker member states which, compared with other member states 
and measured by the respective GNP, have a relatively high 
assessment basis. 
  The balance of the EU budget that is not covered by this 
revenue is financed by way of a standardized rate of payment 
being applied to the respective GNP of member states. The 
harmonization of the assessment of GNP by EC directive was 
started and is making "good progress," according to Bonn 
officials. 
  The regulation on the EU's own resources, which was 
basically 
adopted by the European Council on 11-12 December 1992, is 
intended to reduce the importance of value-added tax funds for 
the period 1995-1999, and is to orient the structure of the EU's 
own resources at the GNP system to a larger extent. This will 
be done through the gradual reduction of the upper ceiling of 
the value-added tax funds from 1.4 percent to 1.0 percent by 
1999 and through the step-by-step reduction of the value-added 
tax assessment basis to 50 percent of the respective GNP for all 
member states. 
  According to the Federal Finance Ministry, from 1989 to 1997 
the Federal Republic of Germany paid or will pay to the 
Community budget the following sums (in billion German marks): 
  1989 -- 23.8 
  1990 -- 22.0 
  1991 -- 32.5 
  1992 -- 35.3 
  1993 -- 37.8 
  1994 -- 44.2 
  1995 -- 45.4 
  1996 -- 48.5 
  1997 -- 52.3 
  However, there have also been payments from the EU budget 
back to the Federal Republic. This means that the net amounts 
paid by Germany were lower (in billion German marks): 
  1989 -- 13.4 
  1990 -- 11.6 
  1991 -- 19.1 
  1992 -- 22.0 
  1993 -- 23.6 
  The Federal Government has said that because of the "erratic 
course of paybacks," it is not possible at this early point to 
estimate the German net payment for 1994. 
  On the basis of the resolutions adopted by the European 
Council in Edinburgh in December 1992, the Council, the European 
Parliament, and the Commission on 29 October 1993 agreed on a 
spending plan for the period 1994-1999. 
  The Federal Government stresses in its statement that it 
will 
stand by the obligations it assumed within the scope of the EC. 
The government, however, is prepared, in the scope of its 
possibilities, to keep the Federal Republic's financial burdens 
within acceptable limits by pursuing a strict course of 
budgetary discipline. 
  The Federal Government will in the future increasingly "push 
its financial interest in higher paybacks to Germany" in 
connection with the formulation of unavoidable Community 
expenditures and in connection with the appropriation of funds. 
It is seeing possibilities of approach in particular in the 
area of the so-called "internal policies."

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  Mixed Reviews on Substance; Points for Style </H8>
  Press opinion on Social Democratic Party (SPD) Chancellor 
candidate Rudolf Scharping's mid-April visit to the United 
States was divided on whether Scharping succeeded in allaying 
U.S. concerns over the SPD's foreign policy--a goal widely 
regarded as his main objective for the trip. Scharping received 
more praise, however, for displaying solid diplomatic skills and 
projecting a statesmanlike personal image during the visit. 
<H5>  Press Split on Mission's Success </H5>
  While some commentators thought Scharping made progress in 
convincing U.S. officials that an SPD-led government would be a 
reliable ally, others saw any such success as largely cosmetic 
and detected lingering U.S. concerns. Viola Herms Drath, 
reporting from Washington for the 15-16 April HANDELSBLATT, was 
among the more favorable reviewers. Scharping, she maintained, 
succeeded during his "Washington debut" in "nipping in the bud 
some prejudices against the Social Democrats as unreliable 
partners" and reducing his perceived "foreign policy 
disadvantage" vis-a-vis Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Drath 
attributed this to the SPD leader's assurances of "continuity" 
with the main thrust of Kohl's foreign policy and emphasis on 
parallels between the SPD's domestic program and that of the 
Clinton Administration. "In Clinton's Washington," Drath 
concluded, these themes "sound familiar and are well received." 
Commentator Leo Wieland, writing in the 15 April edition of the 
FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, agreed that Scharping apparently won his 
"campaign for trust" with his U.S. interlocutors, but implied 
that the sincerity of his promise of continuity remained in 
doubt at home. If Scharping's intent was "to leave the 
impression" that a change in government would not noticeably 
alter Germany's basic foreign policy, Wieland wrote, then "all 
appearances are that he succeeded -- in America." 
  Other commentators remained unconvinced that Scharping had 
put U.S. concerns to rest, especially on the issue of German 
participation in UN-sponsored military operations. Ulrich 
Deupmann, who reviewed the Scharping visit in the 14 April issue 
of the SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, conceded that the U.S. desire for 
Germany to take a greater part in such operations may have 
played "only a subliminal role" in Scharping's meetings with 
U.S. officials, but maintained that "little doubt remains about 
Washington's fundamental expectations." According to Deupmann, 
Scharping apparently left the meetings with the "contradictory" 
impression that increasing Germany's role in UN military 
missions was relatively low on Washington's list of priorities, 
in part because "no one openly expressed such desires to him." 
Kurt Kister, whose commentary appeared in the same newspaper on 
15 April, also highlighted the gap between the U.S. position on 
this issue and Scharping's interpretations of it, ascribing the 
contrast to both U.S. reluctance to mention the issue and 
conscious political calculation by Scharping. The 
administration's decision not to raise the matter with Scharping 
was understandable, Kister noted, since there was no urgent need 
to do so, and "no one discusses the fire department as long as 
nothing is burning." At the same time, the requirements of the 
German election campaign meant that it was "in Scharping's 
interest" to avoid any charges of U.S. arm-twisting. Kister 
pointed out, however, that "even if no one told Scharping in so 
many words," the United States was growing impatient with 
Germany's reluctance to increase its involvement in UN military 
actions, and this friction was imposing a burden on the two 
countries' relations. 
<H5>  Greater Praise for Style </H5>
  By contrast, media opinion was more consistently positive on 
Scharping's diplomatic abilities and the personal image he 
projected during the visit. Reviewers lauded the SPD chairman's 
English-language skills, with descriptions ranging from "fluent, 
if still capable of improvement" (Carlos Widmann in the 18 April 
DER SPIEGEL) to "excellent" (Drath in the 15-16 April 
HANDELSBLATT). Several commentators also pointed out the care 
that Scharping had taken in laying the groundwork for his trip. 
Both Martin Winter, writing in the 16 April issue of the 
FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU, and Dieter Buhl, writing in the 15 April 
edition of DIE ZEIT, called Scharping's preparatory cultivation 
of U.S. contacts "systematic" and Drath, in her HANDELSBLATT 
article, praised the "contacts and knowledge of the American 
mentality" he had developed during his previous U.S. visits. 
Scharping's personal style in representing his party and 
country, however, was the most widely praised aspect of his 
visit. Drath called him "conspicuous for his level-headedness" 
and attributed his success in putting U.S. fears to rest to his 
being a "realistic politician." Buhl, in a more sarcastic vein, 
noted that Scharping's U.S. hosts were "relieved to find that he 
was not, in fact, a pacifist, or even anti-American." 
  Even critical commentators, who sometimes suggested that 
Scharping's moderate style was artificial, conceded that it 
served its alleged purpose. In his 15 April SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG 
commentary, for example, Kister conceded that Scharping's 
"restraint, self-confidence, and sometimes strained friendliness 
left behind the image of a serious, responsible politician." 
Similarly, Wieland, in his 15 April FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE 
review, described Scharping's conduct as "balanced, 
statesmanlike, nonpartisan" and "consensual," even while 
asserting that creating this impression "was precisely [his] 
intention." If there was one repeated criticism of Scharping's 
conduct, it was, in fact, the notion that it was too often 
tailored for political purposes. Some commentators remarked, 
for example, that he too deliberately emphasized parallels 
between his own political ideas and those of Mr. Clinton, as 
when Carola Kaps noted in the 14 April FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE 
that a Scharping speech had "omitted hardly a single catchword" 
used by the U.S. President. Widmann, in his DER SPIEGEL 
article, even implied that Scharping's reflective mood after 
visiting the Holocaust Museum may have been a calculated 
gesture. Far more typical, however, is Wieland's commentary, in 
which, after searching for a single adjective to describe 
Scharping's performance, he finally settled on the word 
"dignified."

<F P=106> ["pop"-signed report: "East Europe Wants German Advisory </F>
Assistance"] 
  [Text] Hamburg -- After experiences with English and U.S. 
advisers that have not always been particularly good, the 
Central and East European countries are now seeking the advice 
of German experts and aid organizations more intensively. That 
was what Walter Kittel, Federal Government representative for 
advisory services in East Europe, said at an event organized by 
the East and Central Europe Association in Hamburg. Over the 
past year, the Federal Government has made German advisory 
services more efficient and improved the coordination of the 
provision of such services among participating ministries. 
Kittel went on to say that the goal of advisory assistance was 
to improve framework conditions for private economic activity 
and the capacity to absorb international financial assistance. 
  The situation in the CIS countries above all has been shaped 
by the fact that former command mechanisms for managing the 
economy have collapsed along with the socialist structures. At 
the same time, an appropriate free market economic system that 
conforms to world markets has yet to be developed. A large part 
of the funds available from the IMF, the World Bank, and the 
East Europe Bank is blocked for that reason, Kittel said. 
  According to information provided by Kittel, the federal 
budget for 1994 contains about 300 million German marks for 
advisory assistance in East Europe. The allocation of the funds 
will be coordinated by the Economics and Foreign Ministries, 
distributed among eight fields of activity and 11 countries (the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, the Baltic 
states, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus) and further coordinated 
with other donors, especially the European Union and 
international financial institutions. In addition, the 
distribution of about a third of the funds will require Kittel's 
approval. In cooperation with each of the partner states, 
medium- and long-term framework programs have been drawn up for 
individual countries. At the beginning of 1994, the programs 
contained more than 800 individual activities. The amounts that 
the recipient countries will obtain are based on objective 
criteria, including Germany's economic and foreign policy 
interests. The projects are based on countries' needs, not on 
the advisers' ideas, and focus on particular fields and regions, 
Kittel said. 
  The Reconstruction Bank [KfW] is drawing up a program for 
conducting assessments and suggesting improvements. The Federal 
Government program is already oriented toward mobilizing at the 
lowest possible cost the knowledge available and personnel 
resources of the relevant organizations, such as the KfW, the 
German Equalization Bank, the Society for Technical Cooperation, 
the Trust Agency, as well as party and business foundations. 
  German business can profit from these advisory services in 
that German investment will be sought in the partner countries 
as a result of the export of German laws, the adoption of German 
technical standards, and the identification and launching of 
private cooperation projects. Viewed against this background, 
Kittel said it was desirable to develop a symmetrical 
relationship between German financial assistance and advisory 
services. Whereas the Germans have borne about two-thirds of 
the costs of financial assistance provided by the G-7 countries, 
Germany's share of G-7 advisory services has only been 25 
percent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Herbert Hax, chairman of the "Council of </F>
Five Wise Men" by Christian Reiermann; place and date not given: 
"`The State Has Some Catching Up To Do'"] 
  [Text] [Reiermann] The research institutes are predicting 
an economic recovery. Is this upswing not coming too early? 
Reforms might not take place because the pressure is easing off. 
  [Hax] We cannot hope for stagnation to continue just to 
force us to do what is necessary. We must also be capable of 
introducing painful reforms during more prosperous times. In 
times of incipient recovery, the labor market will keep 
reminding people to do their homework. Nobody can ignore 4 
million unemployed. 
  [Reiermann] Who will have to stay in to do their homework? 
  [Hax] The state has a lot of catching up to do. It has to 
tackle budget consolidation at all levels with much more 
determination. 
  What is missing is a reliable indicator of when tax breaks 
will be introduced -- for the taxpayer in general and for 
companies in particular. This can be done in spite of the 
public spending deficit, if only saving is taken seriously. In 
addition, the state should do more deregulating and privatizing. 
  [Reiermann] Are you content with the wage round partners? 
  [Hax] Companies and trade unions have acted in a responsible 
manner this year. This must be continued by all means, even if 
the economy picks up again. 
  [Reiermann] Trimming in prosperous times? 
  [Hax] This is difficult. The trade unions in particular 
should realize that they cannot simply demand compensation later 
for the present cutbacks. One thing must be clear to everybody: 
The employment level depends on the wage level. 
  [Reiermann] Companies seem to have achieved the biggest 
progress. 
  [Hax] That is right. But so far, companies have only dealt 
with the destructive part of structural changes: severe cuts in 
costs and jobs. Now we need the creative part. 
  [Reiermann] What does that mean? 
  [Hax] They must set the course for future-oriented growth, 
develop new products, open up new markets. 
  [Reiermann] But this can only work if the framework 
conditions are right. 
  [Hax] Sure, otherwise production moves. In this case, 
Germany would no longer export products, but jobs.

<F P=106> [DPA report: "Bundesbank Lowers `Third Prime Rate'"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- The Bundesbank is again loosening 
the interest reins in small steps. At its latest security 
transactions under repurchase agreement, the Bundesbank 
allocated to the banks 14-day money at a marginal interest rate 
of 5.41 percent. This is 0.06 percentage points less than last 
week. A total of 77 billion German marks [DM] were allocated, 
which were set off by expiring transactions of DM79.2 billion. 
The overwhelming majority of the allocation was at interest 
rates between 5.41 and 5.43 percent. The rate for security 
transactions under repurchase agreement is considered to be the 
third prime rate of the Bundesbank. Because of the large volume 
of these deals it is more important for the money market than 
the classical prime rates, the discount and the Lombard rate, 
which have been at 5 and 6.5 percent respectively since 15 April.

<F P=106> [Axel Hofmann/Guenter Stauch article: "Forward March?"] </F>
  [Text] "We can only keep this up for another two or three 
years, and then we can close shop." Such views from 
high-ranking officers are typical of current moods inside the 
Bundeswehr. 
  The cause of this is not just the difficult debate about the 
future personnel level of the Bundeswehr. Officer 
dissatisfaction mainly concerned equipment -- the Marder tanks 
that have become museum pieces, and the Leo tanks that can only 
be preserved by being reconditioned. Added to these are 
antiquated combat and transport aircraft and elderly vessels. 
  Commanders are annoyed because the Bundeswehr is being 
treated increasingly like "the nation's savings bank," a 
sentiment echoed by the SPD's [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany] Karsten Voigt. With a shrinking Bundeswehr personnel 
level, the defenders of Germany are going to find it 
increasingly difficult to do their duty -- that of guaranteeing 
Germany's security in the NATO alliance. The red pencil is 
attacking from all sides. It is mainly major equipment and 
urgent projects that are suffering. 
  The targets of the relevant people in the Defense Ministry 
are rather high. The 1994 white paper says: "The Bundeswehr 
must be capable of contributing at short notice to the combating 
of possible international crises and conflicts together with our 
partners and allies. It must have sufficient reserves and 
strength for currently the most improbable and most unfavorable 
scenario, the defense of Germany and the alliance." There is a 
huge gap between these expectations and reality. Says Peter 
Kurt Wuerzbach, former state secretary of defense: "It is 
remarkable how soldiers overcome difficulties by means of 
improvisation and initiative." 
  A retired lieutenant colonel says that "what the political 
leadership is doing to the Bundeswehr" is the reason for the 
increasing deficiencies in the defense sphere. Even Joerg 
Schoenbohm, a confidante of Defense Minister Volker Ruehe with 
the rank of secretary of state, stuck his neck out very far at 
the latest Defense Industry Conference. The former general 
criticized the fact that the proportion of the defense budget 
allocated for investment purposes has fallen from 30 percent in 
1990 to 22 percent. 
  With such a level of spending, the long-term equipping of 
crisis-reaction and defense forces so that they may fulfill 
their tasks, and an efficient armament industry, cannot be 
guaranteed, says Schoenbohm. This has been a burning issue for 
the Luftwaffe, navy, and army chiefs for a long time. For years 
they have been shouting about the need for new, modern weapons 
systems in order to meet the noble objectives of the political 
leadership, but with little success, as the inventory shows. 
  The army is the hardest hit. Geared for decades to the 
defense of German territory, this branch of the Bundeswehr is 
now expected to make a significant contribution to international 
crisis control. Says the white paper: "With its strength, the 
army can undertake tasks within a broad spectrum of future 
operations, from the defense of Germany and its allies, right up 
to participation in humanitarian and peace missions." 
  But the reality is as follows: Once the 649 30-year-old M-48 
tanks have been scrapped by 1995 in compliance with the Treaty 
on Conventional Security in Europe, the army will only have 
2,007 Leopard 1 tanks left. But even these are 30 years old; 
258 of them have been reconditioned. Even the successor Leopard 
2 tank is being permanently reconditioned in order at least 
partially to meet the modern requirements for heavy track 
vehicles. The crisis-reaction forces are also to be equipped 
with these vehicles. 
  The army is setting high hopes in the modern mobile 
armor-plated 2000 howitzer. Its predecessor, the M 109-G 
howitzer, has already been in the service of the fatherland for 
three decades, most of this time in repair workshops. 
  The army is worried that there are only enough funds to 
acquire 185 of the Model 2000 howitzers, instead of the 760 
required, and that they will be given to the crisis-reaction 
forces, which is giving rise to fears of the emergence of a 
two-tier army. The Luftwaffe is flying into the next century in 
a state of crisis. The Eurofighter 2000, desired so strongly by 
the Luftwaffe Command, is incapable of escaping from political 
flak. 
  There has also been no cease-fire following the maiden 
flight 
of the technically and tactically proven Fighter 90. This 
aircraft is flying off into a turbulent future after a delay of 
almost two years. Even the former supporters of the 
7-million-German Mark [DM] project now have doubts as to whether 
the Eurofighter is "politically and militarily survivable." The 
Luftwaffe only expects to receive 140 Eurofighters, which are to 
protect German airspace from 2002 onwards. 
  Unless the new fighter is shot down by the autumn 
parliamentary elections, it will replace the F-4 Phantoms, which 
are now over 25 years old. These U.S. veterans, 150 are still 
operational, will be scrapped by 1996 as part of the combat 
upgrading scheme. 
  Fortunately, the heritage of the GDR National People's Army 
includes the neglected but quite efficient MiG-29. Two dozen of 
these machines, brought up to Western standards, should last at 
least another 12 years. 
  On the other hand, it is uncertain how long the workhorse of 
the transport division, the Transall C-160 D, will continue to 
fly. Luftwaffe experts doubt whether it can meet the growing 
demand for a modern transport system, as the Bundeswehr Command 
hopes it can. In any case, this aircraft will soon celebrate 
its 25th birthday. Its possible successor, the multinational 
Future Large Aircraft [previous three words in English], exists 
only on the drawing board. 
  The men on the high seas are not free of problems either. 
But they have fewer problems adapting to new tasks. "We do not 
need any transport capacity, and are quite well-equipped," says 
Captain Manfred Hartmann, naval spokesman at the Defense 
Ministry. In the autumn, the navy will receive the 
"Brandenburg," the first of four new Type 123 frigates, each 
vessel coasting DM585 million. 
  But there is a storm brewing even in the navy. The planned 
Type 124 frigate, the navy flagship for about the year 2004, is 
currently sailing in choppy waters. Instead of the planned four 
vessels at a price of DM650 million each, the officers in 
Gluecksburg, Kiel, and Wilhelmshaven are expecting to receive 
only three. Thus, the three 25-year-old Luetjens-class ships 
are destined to see ignominious service beyond the threshold of 
the next century. 
  Even under water there are problems. The 18 Type 206 
submarines, 12 of which have been modernized, have been 
operating for 20 years. For a long time now, the budget planners 
have been torpedoing plans to build four modern Type 212 
submarines, to the horror of the suffering shipyards. 
  New business is simply impossible with the Bundeswehr.

<F P=106> [Final communique issued by the Schengen Executive Committee </F>
at its meeting in Bonn on 26 April] 
  [Text] The Executive Committee of the Schengen states, 
which met on 26 April 1994 under the chairmanship of Minister of 
State Bernd Schmidbauer, adopted the following final communique: 
  1. At its meeting in Bonn on 26 April 1994, the Executive 
Committee of the Schengen states discussed further measures to 
be taken in the gradual abolition of personal controls at 
internal borders. 
  2. The Executive Committee thereby reiterated its 14 
December 
1993 Paris declaration that all the legal and political 
conditions for the implementation of the Schengen Agreement were 
already in existence, and that an operational Schengen 
information system was the last remaining condition necessary 
for the final abolition of these borders. 
  3. For the purpose of abolishing personal controls at 
internal borders, the Executive Committee agreed on measures to 
be taken, especially the removal of traffic obstacles and 
lifting of traffic restrictions at border crossing points; a 
plan of such measures was adopted. The implementation of this 
plan is the responsibility of each individual Schengen state, 
and depends on the functioning of the Schengen information 
system. 
  4. The participating countries reiterated their firm desire 
to complete the work on the Schengen information system as 
quickly as possible by means of close and trustworthy 
cooperation. For this purpose, project management should be 
improved. A crisis staff has already been appointed, which has 
assumed overall technical responsibility until the Schengen 
information system becomes operational. 
  5. A further condition for the setting in motion of the 
Schengen information system is the successful conclusion of a 
series of tests, which are also meant to locate and remove the 
last remaining technical faults. In order to accelerate this 
process, the participating countries have decided to create a 
third data bank, in order to expand the test capacity. 
  6. The Executive Committee acknowledged the report on the 
Schengen information system produced by independent experts, and 
will in the short term present recommendations for improvements 
on the basis of this report. During final tests on the 
functioning of this system, it will be considered what type of 
service structure to introduce. 
  7. At the same time, the Executive Committee established 
that the operational readiness of the Schengen information 
system would be the starting signal for the abolition of 
personal controls at the internal borders as soon as the 
relevant personal data has been stored in the system. 
  8. The participating countries place themselves under an 
obligation to adapt their national information systems to the 
central information system in Strasbourg, so that a trouble-free 
transfer of data can occur. The consortium of firms led by SEMA 
has also promised its full support for the remaining phases of 
the project. 
  9. A further condition -- the naming by each participating 
country of the bodies authorized to call up data in accordance 
with Article 1001 of the Schengen Agreement -- has been 
fulfilled in the meantime. The Executive Committee will be able 
formally to acknowledge the list of these bodies in accordance 
with Article 101, Paragraph 4 of the agreement after final 
details have been clarified and after the Joint Provisional 
Control Committee has declared its approval. Access to this 
data by the consumers given in the list is the sole 
responsibility of the individual participating country, and will 
be reported to the Executive Committee immediately. 
  10. The Executive Committee acknowledged the opinions of the 
Joint Provisional Control Committee whereby the security 
conditions for loading and operating the Schengen information 
system in the original Schengen signatory countries France, 
Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, and in the 
subsequent member countries Spain and Portugal, are in existence. 
  11. The Executive Committee also acknowledged that work on 
Schengen regulations on the basis of the working program of the 
German chairmanship would be continued. The already adopted 
regulation concerning unified visa issuance procedures has been 
supplemented by an additional regulation concerning the issuance 
of visas at borders. 
  12. In addition, a protocol was signed whereby the 
provisions 
of the Schengen Agreement concerning the granting of political 
asylum will be replaced by the relevant provisions of the Dublin 
Agreement once the latter agreement has entered into effect. 
Thus, the Schengen participating countries displayed yet again 
their status as a pattern and example for the European Union. 
  13. The Executive Committee adopted an interim report on the 
state of talks on Austria's observer status. All participating 
countries support a rapid granting of observer status to Austria. 
  The Executive Committee called on the chairman to continue 
negotiations with Austria, so that the granting of observer 
status to that country can be decided at the next Executive 
Committee meeting. 
  14. The Executive Committee will hold its next meeting in 
Berlin on 27 June 1994.

<F P=106> [Winfried Muenster commentary: "The Pawn of the Eurorebels"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, 3 May -- The European Parliament is 
flexing its muscles. The European Unions's accession treaties 
with Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway require its approval, 
which is not a certainty, however. It is not so much being 
questioned by declared opponents to the membership of these 
countries but by the majority of frustrated members of the 
European Parliament, who are afraid that the Strasbourg assembly 
might never again rise from the shadowy existence of its 
fragmentary powers. For this reason, the rebels do not want to 
approve of the agreements this evening unless the governments 
promise them real parliamentary rights. They also fear that a 
group of 16 will not be able to achieve things that the Twelve 
have failed to accomplish. 
  It is easy for the deputies to revolt, because they do not 
have to declare themselves but can simply press the "no" button. 
Since it is not a majority of votes cast that is required, but 
a majority of the total number of 518 members of the European 
Parliament, staying away from the vote is enough to prevent the 
passing of the agreements. "There is strong resistance against 
the acceptance of new members because it would entail a shift of 
the European focal point eastward and thus strengthen Germany's 
position," Ingo Friedrich, a member of the Christian Social 
Union, pointed out. They do not admit this, however, but 
pretend that they are worried about the further development of 
integration -- the "deepening" of the community. 
  Thus, there is a great deal of hypocrisy involved, 
particularly among some of the French. During the negotiations 
about the Maastricht Treaty, Italy, the Benelux countries, and 
Germany vigorously insisted on a democratization of the 
community, that is on more powers for the Strasbourg assembly. 
Yet Paris and London were against it. French members who did 
not lift a finger at the time to increase the power of the 
European Parliament are now raising the objection that the Union 
should not be enlarged before it is "deepened." 
  However, one cannot only speak of hypocrisy in Strasbourg. 
The overwhelming majority of MP's have indeed reason to rebel, 
because the governments even increased their fears during the 
accession talks. "Deepening before enlargement" was the motto 
under which the deputies wanted to advance the process of 
integration. The opposite seems to be the case now: Enlargement 
and gradually slower integration. They cannot silently accept 
that Great Britain has forced the partners to water down the 
qualified majority vote in the Council of Ministers of an 
enlarged community. 
  Still, most of the deputies know that they must not prevent 
the enlargement if they want to keep the community together. 
Yet the question is how many are still interested and will 
participate in the vote. A total of 50 percent of the present 
deputies will not be returned to the parliament after the 
European elections.

<F P=106> ["ck" report: "Clinton Says All and Nothing"] </F>
  [Text] A news conference of contradictions: The United 
States does not want to play "globocop" in any case, Bill 
Clinton stressed, but if need be, it is willing to act "on its 
own all over the world." The United States insists on its 
"indispensable leading role," but, if possible, it wants to 
"cooperate with others." Intervention in Rwanda is the "only 
possibility to stop the killing," the President said, but the 
United States should not interfere. In the case of Haiti, on 
the other hand, one has "hesitated for too long;" here, 
intervention is being considered. Accusations regarding a 
zig-zag course in Bosnian policy are unjustified. Nevertheless, 
Clinton was unable to give any specific information about how 
the United States intends to behave in view of the imminent 
escalation around Brcko, not to speak of what kind of policy is 
intended to be pursued in Bosnia in the long run. 
  "Clinton helpless" was the primary impression that the 
President gave at his much publicized news conference in 
Atlanta. He announced dubious and very squishy things, while he 
left others out. Why has the United States emphatically 
supported the elected president of Haiti but, at the same time, 
kept silent while the military regime established itself in 
power and exports from Haiti to the United States rose by about 
50 percent? And why does it now suddenly want to act since the 
streams of refugees have diminished after all? 
  Clinton did not have much to say on the human rights 
situation in China nor on the conflict with North Korea. He 
escaped into generally known things and remained vague. In this 
way, he was unable to refute the criticism of the lack of 
concepts in his foreign policy.

<F P=106> [Rolf Paasch dispatch from Atlanta: "It Must Be Night for </F>
Clinton's Stars to Shine...."] 
  [Text] Once again it was time. U.S. President Bill 
Clinton was facing harsh criticism of his foreign policy -- or 
of his neglect of foreign policy -- and he took the bull by the 
horns. Over the 16 months of his presidency so far, the bull 
usually was where the cameras stood. Be it a news conference in 
the White House, which was convened just to justify his actions; 
the carefully staged "town hall meeting" in the midst of an 
impressive crowd of citizens; or the "Global Forum" that was 
carried by the U.S. television station CNN on Tuesday evening [3 
May]: The ups and downs of devastating accusations, their 
"talkmasterly" refutation of political mishaps, their telegenic 
correction of neglect of international crises, and correcting 
this in a way that is very impressive for the public, have 
become the characteristic quality of this President. The man in 
the White House made mistakes in the Whitewater scandal, is 
swaying in social policy, and is sloppy in foreign policy -- but 
then he makes his critics look like school children in public. 
  This is also what happened on Tuesday at CNN in Atlanta. 
Journalists from 80 countries asked hesitatingly -- and the 
president answered grandly. The political pressure to act had 
become too great; thus, Bill Clinton used the "Global Forum" to 
sell the domestic and international audience a new policy for 
Haiti. It is time "to go" for the military rulers in 
Port-au-Prince and to let the elected and then ousted President 
Aristide return from his exile in the United States. Suddenly, 
the President "no longer" wanted to rule out military 
intervention, knowing that junta chief General Raoul Cedras can 
also receive "CNN International." However, the Clinton 
administration's policy toward Haiti, with its direct 
deportation of Haitian refugees, remains as morally dubious as 
it was before and the threatened replacement of the diplomacy of 
compromise with a military intervention can hardly be taken 
seriously, particularly since the sanctions, which have now been 
applied for at the UN Security Council, are far less than what 
critics demand. However, Clinton's appearance in Atlanta was 
certainly sufficient to reestablish the "image" of a competent 
President who is dedicated to foreign policy. A strong 
statement on Haiti, an elegantly oscillating answer regarding 
the policy toward Bosnia, a monologue full of statistics on the 
human rights conflict with China -- compared with that, the 
harmless questions of the journalists felt like interjections by 
gullible country bumpkins. If President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
was the inventor of the charming "fireside chats" on the radio 
and John F. Kennedy was the first U.S. President of the 
television age, then Bill Clinton is the master of interactive 
media talks, from the local radio talk show to global satellite 
conferences. 
  However, it is quite a different question whether these 
skills Clinton has guarantee a successful presidency, because 
the rescue attempts are subject to the law of diminishing 
returns: Every time he manages to talk himself out of a 
quandary, a bit of the authority of his presidency seems to have 
been used up. For the superficial television watcher such 
tricks may be sufficient, but Clinton will hardly manage in this 
way to create a community of supporters dedicated to him, 
because what his critics have repeatedly accused the President 
of is not a lack of competence, but a lack of concentration, 
staying power, character, and credibility. These are qualities 
whose credible presentation requires more than a "Global Forum" 
a la CNN.

<F P=106> ["J. B."-initialed commentary: "Arms Deliveries to Turkish </F>
War Lords"] 
  [Text] Bonn's decision to resume German arms deliveries to 
Turkey is strange. The Turks' war against the Kurds on the 
territory of the Turkish state is a fact, no matter how it is 
expressed in terms of international law. The arms deliveries 
onesidedly help one party to the war. Of course, this cannot be 
an argument in favor of thinking about whether one should also 
provide weapons to the other, the Kurdish side -- if it could 
pay for them. One should not send any weapons to this region, no 
matter what the borders there are like. Borders are not eternal 
-- the Germans in particular have been able to experience this 
gratefully, despite CSCE guarantees. 
  The Federal Government's spokesman noted that German weapons 
are not used against the Kurds; the evaluation of the 
photographs presented by German observers and Kurdish groups did 
not prove that they are. The question is whether this should be 
the basis on which the Federal Government can give itself a 
clear conscience. If it had said that we have informed 
ourselves with the necessary care and by using all means 
available to us and can, therefore, rule out that the weapons 
delivered by Germany are used against the Kurds, this would mean 
a bit more. 
  It would not mean much more and would be far too little for 
the decision that has been made now, however. A country like 
Turkey needs more weapons than those it is using against the 
Kurds. The more it gets for other tasks, the more it can send to 
Kurdistan. Therefore, the German deliveries play a role in this 
war against the Kurds in any case.

  [Text] Prime Minister-Designate Silvio Berlusconi has given 
only an oblique reply to Umberto Bossi's request to suspend the 
summit meetings between the heads of the Freedom Alliance: "He 
thinks that he needs a pause for thought; however, I will 
continue on the path that I have chosen. I received the mandate 
from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and from the voters, and I 
must carry out my duty. I will keep the allies informed," he 
stressed, "But I will act in accordance with Article 92 of the 
Constitution." 
  Bossi did not attend the scheduled meeting with Berlusconi 
and Gianfranco Fini. Fini said that the League "is wrong to 
make conditions." The obstacle is still the same one: the 
Interior Ministry.

<F P=106> [Interview with Umberto Bossi, Italian Northern League </F>
Secretary, by Alessandro Caprettini in Rome; date not given: 
"Bossi: `Either We Get Interior Ministry or We Stay Outside'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Caprettini] So, the League is 
insisting on the Viminale [Interior Ministry].... 
  [Bossi] Of course I am insisting, and I have two candidates: 
Roberto Maroni and...Maroni Roberto. If we want to remain 
friends, they had better choose the former. 
  [Caprettini] However, there is talk of a [President] 
Scalfaro 
veto on the subject.... 
  [Bossi] Not that I am aware of. In any case, according to 
the Constitution -- and I have been doing some homework on the 
Constitution -- all the head of state can do is countersign the 
list. Moreover...that is not how things stand. 
  [Caprettini] Well, tell us how they do stand, then. 
  [Bossi] I asked for an explanation last week. I asked if 
there were problems regarding the Viminale.... 
  [Caprettini] You asked Scalfaro? (Bossi nods). And what was 
his reply? 
  [Bossi] He said no, there were no objections. Therefore.... 
  [Caprettini] Therefore it is up to Berlusconi to decide.... 
  [Bossi] It is up to us in the first instance. 
  [Caprettini] Regardless of the claim to the Viminale, there 
is the Treasury issue. Do you not want Dini? 
  [Bossi] Dini...the problem is different! Dini is all right 
at the Treasury, but we must have the former state holdings. 
We, and not those ministers who have always shored up 
Mediobanca must run the privatization program! 
  [Caprettini] You have your sights set on Interior and the 
Budget -- which is to handle privatization. Any other targets? 
  [Bossi] We have always said that we want to have direct 
control over the changeover process. Interior, Budget, and 
Industry too serve this purpose. Do they really want a change? 
Then let them prove it, otherwise there is.... external 
support. However, I do not believe that they are not paying 
attention to us. They need legitimation in Europe, and we have 
the means to bestow it, to safeguard other countries from the 
risks represented by Berlusconi and that nonexistent party 
called Forza Italia, in which there has never been an election, 
not even once.... 
  [Caprettini] But was it not the MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] 
that constituted the danger? 
  [Bossi] The danger is the delay that there has been in 
political change, which has fostered Forza Italia's success: 
the delays in National Alliance [AN], which has problems with 
its flag; the delays in a left wing that is sluggish in its 
adoption of laborism; the delays, too, in a League that is split 
over federalism. People wanted stability, governability...and 
these delays worked in favor of Forza Italia, which has filled a 
void. The only thing is that, at this point, we must go all out 
for change, because the risk is one of a return to the past. We 
have change on one side and restoration on the other. At the 
end of the day, whoever manages to occupy the center in the pole 
for freedom, forcing AN to state clearly where it stands and the 
Left to free itself of the past, will emerge as the winner. It 
will be a hard-fought battle, and it will last at least a year, 
but the League will come out on top in the end, not the least 
because I have an ace up my sleeve. 
  [Caprettini] It would appear that you see Mediobanca in 
particular as a feature of the old system. Why? 
  [Bossi] We have always called for a law providing for the 
creation of public companies. We have had enough of [Mediobanca 
President] Cuccia, who makes and breaks all the deals with the 
big families! 
  [Caprettini] And what do you think of Previti as a potential 
minister of justice? Would this be change or restoration? 
  [Bossi] Previti? Yes, he will do. There are those who want 
a republic ruled by judges, like in ancient Israel, but I am 
like Samson, and I will not have my hair cut, okay? 
  [Caprettini] Do you catch a whiff of burning in the 
examining 
magistrates' moves? 
  [Bossi] They must carry on doing their part, but I am afraid 
that there is a very political, politicized part. In Milan they 
are putting us in the dock as if the Bribery City affair were 
our fault...ours! The force that created the prerequisites for 
the "Clean Hands" pool! And they try to use an allegation that 
Sama makes just at the right time to delegitimize us before the 
polls.... There are allegations emerging at intervals here, 
clockwork justice that leaves us very puzzled. 
  [Caprettini] Look here, Bossi, one of the objections voiced 
against the League's claim to the Viminale is that you would 
then spy on your friends and opponents.... 
  [Bossi] Rubbish! I am not a man who cultivates suspicions. 
Just ask my wife...women know everything. 
  [Caprettini] You will be having a meeting with Berlusconi in 
a few hours. However, the two of you do not see much of each 
other. Funny, is it not, for two allies? 
  [Bossi] Not at all! We see little of each other...as two 
great friends do. That is all there is to it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Giuseppe Tatarella, Italian National </F>
Alliance lower house floor leader, by Giovanni Valentini; place 
and date not given: "Fascists? No Longer: The Voters Said So" 
-- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- Giuseppe Tatarella, the MSI's [Italian 
Social Movement] lower house floor leader, is a candidate for 
the deputy premiership and will in any case lead the AN 
[National Alliance] delegation to the government. Even if the 
"antifascist veto" comes into effect against ministers 
originating from the MSI, an exception will probably be made in 
his case. So at present Tatarella is a key person to talk to to 
discover the intentions of the far Right. 
  [Valentini] You say that the fascist chapter is closed. But 
when was it closed? And how? 
  [Tatarella] In reply, I would draw your attention to two 
events. The first is the vote -- which even we did not expect 
-- for [AN leader] Fini in the Rome municipal elections: With 
46.9 percent of the votes, half the voters showed that they 
wanted a different kind of political representation and a new 
figure. The other event was the tribute paid by Fini at the 
Fosse Ardeatine [site of Nazi retaliation slaughter], 
immediately after the local elections. This means that the 
National Alliance was created from the bottom up, rather than in 
the laboratory. 
  [Valentini] Nevertheless, many people object that this 
turnabout is still too recent to be credible. 
  [Tatarella] Actually this process started a long time ago. 
Between the late fifties and early sixties, when the MSI was a 
national socialist force, Young Italy was formed, already 
prefiguring the present form of the AN. That organization 
brought together youngsters of differing backgrounds, 
originating from two main tendencies -- one Catholic, the other 
nonconfessional and pro- Risorgimento. This minority outlook, 
which transcended the conflict between fascism and antifascism, 
has always been a constant factor in our internal debate. 
  [Valentini] Yes, but the debate did not make much progress 
after that.... 
  [Tatarella] That was not our fault. What prevented the 
debate from developing was the veto against the MSI. And our 
only option remained entrenchment. Other people were to blame. 
  [Valentini] What has changed now? 
  [Tatarella] With the demise of the DC [Christian Democratic 
Party]-PCI [Italian Communist Party] polarization and the 
introduction of a first-past-the-post system, our internal 
debate -- hitherto confined for the sake of self-preservation -- 
has now exploded; and the voters have supported the creation of 
a modern and moderate Right at the European level. It is no 
coincidence that the working class vote went to so many 
representatives of both tendencies -- the Catholic and the 
pro-Risorgimento, people who never had any connection with 
fascism, and who have none now. 
  [Valentini] What about the old MSI? 
  [Tatarella] At the latest meeting of its Central Committee, 
the final document, approved unanimously, stresses the concept 
of freedom and democracy. We face a twofold challenge, with 
respect both to ourselves and to others: to remain loyal to 
these principles and to be assessed on the basis of what we will 
do. 
  [Valentini] The Damocletian sword of the "antifascist veto" 
still hangs over the next government. If it remains, how could 
you become deputy prime minister? 
  [Tatarella] I am not aware of any such vetoes against us. Be 
that as it may, I will be the head of the delegation to the 
government. That is, I will have the honor and task of 
representing Fini's National Alliance. And a delegation implies 
the presence of several politicians: The delegation will be 
composed of both components that comprised the AN and the 
MSI-National Right, constitutionally legitimized by the voters. 
  [Valentini] Will it be a center government, as Berlusconi 
says, or a center-Right government, as Fini says? 
  [Tatarella] It will be a government of the center and the 
Right. It is not the government's duty to determine electoral 
areas, but quite the reverse. In Italy, as in France, we will 
have two groupings -- one of the Right and one of the center -- 
that join together as an alternative to the left-wing forces. 
  [Valentini] Nevertheless, the reservations and uncertainties 
remain abroad: In America Franco Modigliani, winner of the 
Nobel Prize for economics, says that he fears "the fascists' 
return to power." How do you answer that? 
  [Tatarella] I would answer the illustrious Professor 
Modigliani by saying, first, that, irrespective of anything 
else, a withdrawal into exile is inadvisable, because the 
encounter must take place on the field, not on the sidelines. 
Furthermore, I am willing to cite the statements by 
authoritative representatives of European culture and politics 
who are waiting to see, before they form an assessment -- from 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe to the political scientist, 
Alain Touraine, and the historian, Jacques Le Goff. 
  [Valentini] And what do you intend to do to reassure the 
public abroad? 
  [Tatarella] We will tour the American, British, and French 
universities, starting with the Modigliani university, to talk 
with teachers and students, to make ourselves known, and to 
explain that the anomalous situation in Italy has ended and that 
the picture in Europe is settling down; in other words, here too 
there is a democratic Right. 
  [Valentini] People still called you former fascists, 
postfascists, neofascists. With which of these descriptions do 
you identify most? 
  [Tatarella] With none of them. I identify with that which I 
have used of myself for the past 20 years: For better or worse, 
I am a right-winger.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vito Gnutti, Italian Northern League deputy, </F>
by Massimo Arcidiacono in Milan on 1 May: "`More Work? Let Us 
Begin by Having Faith in It'"] 
  [Text] Whether at the Labor Ministry or the Industry 
Ministry, in Via Flavia or Via Molise, there seems to be no 
doubt about the destiny of Vito Gnutti, businessman and founding 
member of the Northern League: He will be a minister in the 
Berlusconi "team." 
  Indeed, his name is one of the few that has never been 
missing from the countless ministerial sweepstakes published by 
the dailies over the last month. A sure winner, for everyone 
except himself, an unorthodox conservative who only dropped two 
names, Keynes and Gramsci, in the course of a 45-minute 
interview: "I keep hearing this rumor reported in the papers, 
and I have to thank you, but I can only deny it. I have been 
told nothing official." 
  [Arcidiacono] Maybe, but as of today, 1 May, no one is 
better 
qualified than you to talk about the million jobs we have heard 
so much about. But, to change the subject, is your preference 
for the Labor or Industry Ministry? 
  [Gnutti] There you go again. There is a certain difference 
between the two ministries. However, even if the eventuality 
arises, I do not believe that I shall be given a choice. You 
have the wrong person, I am not as important as that. Of 
course, I am an industrialist, but you must draw your own 
conclusions. As far as the million jobs are concerned, I have 
few illusions. I am not naive enough to believe that once the 
government is formed, a million jobs will pop up out of nowhere 
on 2 May. I do not believe it, and Berlusconi does not believe 
it either, but I know that the basic requisite for achieving 
this target is optimism of the will. If we have that, then I 
believe that we will achieve the target, not overnight, but by 
making the right, prudent decisions. Indeed, I believe that we 
shall need even more jobs: We shall have to compensate for the 
unemployment rife in some public sectors, unproductive work, 
false employment. I am convinced that it is possible to do 
this; what I do not share is the pessimism of those who believe 
that the unemployed will always be with us. I just believe that 
it is the prime task of politicians, no matter whether right- or 
left-wing, to create jobs. 
  [Arcidiacono] So it is by no mere coincidence that 
Berlusconi 
has opted to begin his consultations with the two sides of 
industry (the unions and the employers) rather than with the 
usual parties. 
  [Gnutti] Unlike you, I do not attach such great significance 
to this decision. After all, he had to start somewhere. In a 
way, he is showing that many of the things that have been said 
about the marketeers, about the conquering, evil Right, can be 
proved false. What is more important is the sequel to this 
decision: I hope there will be talks in which listening and 
discussion will be the order of the day, not interparty 
compromise, as used to be the case. 
  [Arcidiacono] Nevertheless, once the government has been 
formed, faith will not be enough. The right recipe, so to 
speak, will be needed. Have you any "ingredients" to suggest? 
  [Gnutti] First of all, greater mobility, because this is the 
only thing that creates higher employment. Then temporary work, 
apprenticeships, part-time work, and fair wages for those 
accessing the labor market. You see, the Left has always 
considered that rendering the system more rigid constituted a 
social advance, but it was wrong, as this only provided 
guarantees for those who already had jobs, not those who had to 
acquire one. This is not being progressive, it means conserving 
the status quo; this is where the Left contradicts itself, and 
it lost votes on this issue. 
  [Arcidiacono] Just to be clear, will you explain why it 
would 
be right to resort to the controversial system of wage zoning in 
the south.... 
  [Gnutti] We in the League believe that pay should be linked 
to the cost of living. If the cost of living indexes show that 
a worker in the south spends less than his counterpart in the 
north, his earnings must reflect that ratio, in other words they 
must be lower. It is not a malicious desire to "punish" the 
people in the south that leads me to say these things, it is a 
conviction that it can be a helpful solution. The International 
Monetary Fund, the Bank of Italy, and a CNEL [National Council 
for Economy and Labor] survey agree on the need to do away with 
this constraint. Federalism could be another instrument, and the 
true supporters of the south believe in it. 
  And there are many other constraints from which firms should 
be freed; it is the only way to raise employment, becoming more 
competitive, reducing taxes on profits so that firms can plow 
them back, redeploying resources, combating subsidies, and thus 
reducing the public deficit. It is not true that it cannot be 
done, it is not true that computers merely eat up jobs. 
  [Arcidiacono] You will encounter obstacles. Which ones do 
you expect? 
  [Gnutti] We must have faith in our ability to get there. 
This is no invention of mine, it is the lesson of Keynes, it is 
Gramsci's optimism of the will, as opposed to the pessimism of 
intelligence. One obstacle could be preconceived opposition from 
the Left, but I do not think so. After all, they are working 
for people's good as well.

  [Excerpts] Problems still remain for the new government, 
which must also deal with the rivalries impelling all the 
parties to run independently at the forthcoming European 
elections to be held on 12 June. Attilio Romita reports: 
  [Romita] All the parties have entered the fray of the 
forthcoming European elections. Following March's electoral 
earthquake, we have a new test which will weigh heavily on the 
shoulders of the new political leadership. Partial local 
elections will be held on the same day; 9 million voters 
throughout Italy will have to elect a new regional council in 
Sardinia, 11 provincial councils, and 485 town councils. The 
local elections affect 92 cities with over 15,000 [as received] 
inhabitants, and of those cities 21 are provincial capitals. 
  In the race for Strasbourg, all the parties are pitted 
against each other. Due to the system of proportional 
representation and the disappointments of March, the parties 
will run independently at the European elections -- both on the 
left and the right. The only alliance is that of the Italian 
Socialist Party and the Democratic Alliance. 
  Silvio Berlusconi will head the Forza Italia list of 
candidates. [passage omitted] 
  All the big guns will also be running in the election; 
Umberto Bossi, Gianfranco Fini, Achille Occhetto, Fausto 
Bertinotti, Mario Segni, Carlo Ripa di Meana, and Leoluca 
Orlando. Giorgio la Malfa is considering whether to participate. 
  Finally, Francesco Moser, former world cycling champion, is 
preparing to run for the Union Valdotaine.

  [Text] If the Freedom Alliance is having problems coming to 
an agreement on forming the new cabinet, then the Party of the 
Democratic Left [PDS] is also going through a tough time in the 
run-up to its autumn congress. Rocco Tolfa reports: 
  [Tolfa] Smiles, handshakes and peace signals -- all this in 
public. In reality there is a battle going on between Achille 
Occhetto and Massimo D'Alema. The battle is taking place in the 
secret rooms of the party's headquarters in Rome, however, 
rumors of this duel are emerging and Occhetto has let it be 
known that he could even give up the secretaryship of the PDS on 
condition that D'Alema is not his successor. The battle is 
wounding the party. 
  [Emanuel Macaluso] "I have never understood what the 
political basis for their divisions were. There has never been 
any sort of explanation in any party publication nor in public." 
  [Tolfa] A personal dispute? The men from the party say no. 
  [Fabio Mussi] "None of us -- from Occhetto downward -- can 
remain in his place for ever and ever. What counts is the 
political perspective, and it remains to be seen who will be in 
charge." 
  [Tolfa] Moves and countermoves in the light of the 
forthcoming autumn congress. Occhetto has tried to calm the 
waters by offering D'Alema the deputy leadership of the party. 
The editor of the party newspaper, L'UNITA has for the moment 
said no. He said that at present he does not want to enter the 
fray, but it is clear that he is now part of the fight. It is 
from this settling of scores that the man to challenge 
Berlusconi will emerge.

<F P=106> [Report by Arturo Zampaglione: "Clinton Illustrates His </F>
Foreign Policy: `We Are Not the World's Policemen'"] 
  [Text] New York -- Last Tuesday evening [3 May] Bill 
Clinton entered CNN's "global village" to defend his foreign 
policy, following the humiliations suffered in Somalia and 
Bosnia, as well as numerous criticisms from abroad, and his 
recent flunking in opinion polls. "The United States cannot 
solve the whole world's problems, and must not become the 
world's policemen," the President said defensively in response 
to questions from almost 100 journalists. "But we have the 
obligation to join other countries to alleviate suffering and 
restore peace." 
  Clinton went on to illustrate American strategy in the 
various hot spots, acknowledging that he had made some mistakes 
and underestimated some problems, but highlighting the 
consistency of his foreign policy doctrine. However, he did not 
manage to free himself from the memory of his two predecessors, 
Richard Nixon and George Bush, who seemed to be haunting the 
platform at the Jimmy Carter Library, where the interview took 
place. 
  Until the very end, Nixon severely criticized the 
international choices made by the White House under the 
Democrats. Shortly before his death, he sent Random House 
Publishers the manuscript of Beyond Peace, in which 
-- referring to 15 months of Clinton Administration -- he wrote 
that "if the United States wants to continue to lead the world, 
it must first decide it wants to do so, and then take the 
necessary measures to move from words to deeds." 
  Bush, who achieved victory in the Gulf war, is the living 
proof that the United States still has the strength to impose 
peace and defeat aggression within the new international order. 
Therefore, he is a nagging figure for Clinton, because he 
reminds him of the fact that a drastic, energetic solution is 
theoretically possible also in Bosnia, as suggested yesterday by 
Margaret Thatcher in an article published in the NEW YORK TIMES 
under the title "Stop The Serbs. Now. For Good." 
  Haunted by Nixon and Bush's specters, but unable to express 
a 
full-fledged international leadership doctrine of his own -- 
which, anyway, at least so far, has not been among his 
priorities -- Clinton tried to highlight, on the one hand, some 
of the White House's successes (such as the Middle East 
agreement, the ratification of NAFTA, the dismantling of the 
former Soviet nuclear arsenal) and, on the other hand, the 
limits of American action in the critical areas. In such areas 
-- he said somewhat hesitatingly -- the United States cannot act 
as a "police force," but rather, must build consensus, and act 
jointly with the international community. 
  Bosnia is a case in point: Clinton admitted that the 
situation in the former Yugoslavia was much more complicated 
than he had thought during the electoral campaign. He blamed to 
a large extent Bush's procrastination, and said that he had done 
"his best." He then summarized the American position: "yes" to 
the possible use of NATO aircraft to defend the six safe areas, 
and extending this to Brcko, the Serbian town at the center of a 
strategic corridor which may become the scene for the next 
battle between the three armies; "no" to direct American 
intervention "which would run the risk of prolonging the war"; 
"yes" to lifting the arms embargo for Muslims and Croats, 
although Europeans are opposed to this. 
  It was precisely over the Bosnia issue that the debate in 
Atlanta went through its tensest moment. CNN Sarajevo 
correspondent Christiane Amapour tauntingly requested an 
explanation for American hesitations. Clinton lost his temper: 
"Come off it, madam! What hesitations?" "Undoubtedly," he 
then explained, "I underestimated the difficulties involved in 
building a coalition and reaching an agreement within NATO. Of 
course, I would have preferred Europeans to align themselves 
with my positions. But I must also respect their opinions and 
their experience in that area." 
  This latest remark seemed to be reserved for home 
consumption. In fact, requests for unilateral American action -- 
aimed, in particular, at rearming the Muslims -- are snowballing 
in Congress. Clinton wished to warn of the dangers involved in 
such a move, which could turn against the United States in the 
future. He tried to draw a distinction between situations where 
U.S. vital interests are at stake -- and where, therefore, 
acting alone is justifiable -- and situations where it is only a 
question of upholding the general principle of peace. 
  Speaking of China, Clinton seemed to favor a compromise on 
the civil rights' issue, which he had previously linked to the 
extension of the preferential nation clause. Furthermore, he 
promised South Africa financial aid to the tune of $600 million. 
As regards Haiti, he did not rule out American military 
intervention. However, it is unlikely that these summary 
expressions of decisiveness on international matters, as 
broadcast by Ted Turner's CNN, will succeed -- within the next 
few days -- in changing the opinion of Americans: 41 percent of 
them, compared to 40 percent, say that they disapprove of 
Clinton's foreign policy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gonzalez Will Deliver Solchaga's and </F>
Corcuera's Heads to Pujol as Guarantee"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Felipe Gonzalez is willing to deliver 
the heads demanded by his partner, Jordi Pujol. Carlos 
Solchaga, Jose Luis Corcuera, and Jose Barrionuevo -- implicated 
in the Mariano Rubio and Luis Roldan cases -- will relinquish 
their parliamentary responsibilities before the 12 June 
elections, according to Socialist sources. CiU [Convergence and 
Union], which has demanded that he "take the bull by the horns," 
yesterday forced him to appear before a plenary session of the 
Congress of Deputies next Wednesday [11 May]. 
  CiU, within which Jordi Pujol and Jose Antonio Duran Lleida 
seem to have again shared between them the roles of conciliator 
and hard- liner -- though their basic stance is similar -- and 
the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party], to which the Socialists and 
the Catalan nationalists are again paying attention in order not 
to appear isolated, have decided to grant Felipe Gonzalez 
temporary support conditional on the implementation of a 
strategy that was largely formulated jointly. 
  During the 2 May holiday Felipe Gonzalez, helped by Narcis 
Serra, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, and Javier Solana, obtained an 
extension of support to deal with the harassment by the PP 
[People's Party] and the IU [United Left], granted to him by the 
CiU and PNV. Furthermore, Gonzalez presented his strategy for 
resolving the crisis to the narrow circle of his closest aides. 
  According to Socialist sources, this strategy includes 
Carlos 
Solchaga's resignation as parliamentary spokesman and Jose Luis 
Corcuera's and Jose Barrionuevo's resignation of their 
parliamentary seats, as demanded by CiU, even though the 
government says that "there is no pressure" from Jordi Pujol. 
  Gonzalez wants to play these cards very cautiously and 
gradually, realizing that he must not leave himself without 
"trumps" in the event of a process whose duration cannot be 
estimated. However, the deadline for playing these cards has 
been set -- a month at the most, that is, by the European and 
Andalusian elections on 12 June. 
  According to opposition sources, Minister of the Prime 
Minister's Office Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba has in practice taken 
over Solchaga's responsibilities. Indeed, it was Rubalcaba who 
spoke with CiU spokesman Miguel Roca and PNV spokesman Inaki 
Anasagasti in order to secure those groups' support for the 
government's refusal to accept the PP's demand for Gonzalez to 
make a special appearance before the Congress of Deputies.

Strike in June Unless Industrial Policy Is Negotiated"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- The UGT [General Workers Union] and 
CCOO [Workers Commissions] have called a large demonstration in 
Madrid on 17 May to protest against the industrial crisis and to 
demand a pledge from the government to conduct negotiations on 
the future of industry. A refusal from the government would 
prompt the holding of "much tougher" actions in June, the 
secretaries general of the metalworkers, Manuel Fernandez "Lito" 
and Ignacio Fernandez Toxo, said yesterday. 
  In order to secure negotiations on industrial policy, the 
trade unions have drawn up a strategy for exerting pressure that 
will begin 17 May with a large rally in Madrid, which they 
forecast will be attended by 10,000 trade union delegates from 
all over Spain. 
  At the same time they will draw up a document setting out 
what form industrial policy should take, which will be presented 
to trade union officials at the rally and which will 
subsequently be submitted to Industry Minister Juan Manuel 
Eguiagaray.

  If, after these two actions, the government does not pledge 
to conduct negotiations on the future of industry, the major 
trade unions will organize "much tougher" actions in June, the 
secretaries general of the UGT and CCOO metalworkers, Manuel 
Fernandez "Lito" and Ignacio Fernandez Toxo, announced 
yesterday. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Abel Matutes, European commissioner for </F>
Transportation and Energy, by correspondent Jose Carlos Duque; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] Abel Matutes, 52, is the European commissioner 
for Transportation and Energy. "I will serve in that capacity 
until 18 April, the scheduled date of a Council of Ministers 
meeting that is of fundamental importance to Spain. It is at 
that meeting that the overall European plan for infrastructures 
will be approved for the ports, airports, navigable waterways, 
and so on...to be financed out of European funds." The former 
senator, former deputy, and founder of the Baleares Liberal 
Party...now heads the PP [People's Party] list for the European 
elections and takes stock of the nearly nine years he has served 
as a European minister. His conclusion: "I have gone to bat for 
Spain a great deal in Europe." 
  [Duque] Are you going to leave the post of European 
commissioner (European minister) of Transportation and Energy in 
order to head the PP list for the European Parliament? 
  [Matutes] Yes. The Council of Ministers meeting scheduled 
for 
18 April will be my last. It will be decisive for Europe and 
Spain because it will pass the overall European plan for 
infrastructures: the ports, airports, navigable waterways, and 
highways, putting Spain's projects in a position to be financed 
by European funds. Although there is no incompatibility 
whatsoever between my office as a commissioner and heading the 
PP list for the European Parliament, I prefer to remove myself 
in order to wage my campaign with complete freedom. 
  [Duque] You have been a European commissioner for nearly 
nine 
years, but what have you done for Spain in Europe? 
  [Matutes] I have always tried to pave the way for a soft, 
painless arrival of Spanish businesses in the Community enabling 
them to compete on good terms and ensuring that the framework 
provided will facilitate that task. The understanding and trust 
of the Spanish Government that I have enjoyed at all times have 
been exemplary. I think that I have done my work conscientiously 
and that it has been recognized, not only by the Spanish 
Government, but by businessmen as well.... However, the great 
battle of the Spanish economy will be won or lost depending on 
whether or not it has good domestic policies. What will make us 
able to compete on the big market is the framework of Spanish 
fiscal policy, whether or not we promote savings and investment, 
meaning whether we create jobs and competitiveness or penalize 
such investments, whether or not we train good professionals and 
specialists.... 
  [Duque] And what is left for you to do as a European 
commissioner if most of Spain's policy remains to be carried out? 
  [Matutes] There is a common area that increasingly affects 
all of our lives, the policy on infrastructures, for example. 
All of the projects now under way will be 80 to 90 percent 
cofinanced out of European funds. In addition, agricultural 
policy is dictated by Europe, as is the common transportation 
policy, the environmental policy. VAT [value-added tax] rates 
are also decided in Europe.... Just imagine how important that 
is! 
  [Duque] What have you gained as a European commissioner? 
  [Matutes] These nine years have been years of very hard 
work, 
years when I have put in 14 or 15 hours a day on the average, 
here in and abroad, on plans almost constantly. However, at the 
same time, the work has been a thrilling challenge for me and a 
very gratifying task insofar as I have been able to carry out 
important missions for my country and Europe. During my first 
term as a commissioner, I was entrusted with the task of 
handling Credit and Investments, the Development of Financial 
Engineering, Policy for the PYMES. I managed to get a favorable 
policy for small and medium-size enterprises. At the same time, 
I launched the ECU [European currency unit] on markets 
throughout the world, in New York and Tokyo in particular.... 
During my second term, as the commissioner responsible for 
Mediterranean Policy and North-South and Latin American 
Relations, I achieved closer bonds with Latin America--which was 
very low on the list of priorities--and strengthened ties with 
neighboring countries, which are of prime importance for Spain. 
Now, as commissioner of Transportation and Energy, I have 
carried out the overall European infrastructure and transport 
plans so essential to Spain. I am also completing the directive 
for gas and electricity that will make it possible to integrate 
those markets into a single European market, that of the Twelve. 
  [Duque] What does this mean in practical terms? 
  [Matutes] A drop in the price of gas and electricity. 
  [Duque] You will make it possible for the price of gas and 
electricity to go down? 
  [Matutes] Yes. We are going to do so by introducing 
competition into markets that are now national and governed by 
monopolies and oligopolies. We are going to introduce free 
competition on a Community scale. 
  [Duque] And do you think the average citizen will understand 
this? 
  [Matutes] We often experience the problem that what is done 
in Europe is done by governments and not sufficiently explained 
to the citizens, but everyone realizes the importance of 
introducing competition between companies operating in these 
sectors. It will result in a drop in prices. 
  [Duque] That is fine, but what will a European minister tell 
farmers who feel they have been deceived, hurt, and mistreated 
by Europe? 
  [Matutes] They do feel mistreated and rightly so. For many 
years, farmers were very well treated by the Community even 
though they endured the protectionism of the EEC. Then, at the 
precise time that Spain joined the EC, due to international 
pressures aimed at a liberalization of farm markets and budget 
austerity, the farmers had to endure the consequences of opening 
the Community to outside markets and have less aid.... They are 
having a hard time of it, but so are all European farmers. And 
if we had to make a scale, I would say that all those who 
enjoyed the most protection, the farmers in the north and on the 
continent, are having the hardest time of all. I mean those who 
grow grain and oil-yielding plants, along with many livestock 
breeders. In contrast, those growing fruit and produce will not 
be so badly hurt. 
  [Duque] That is true, but how will you explain it to them? 
Is 
it not a fact that Europe has a debt to most Spanish farmers? 
  [Matutes] Europe does indeed have a debt to those Spanish 
farmers who have not benefited from the policy of "common 
splendor"; that is a fact. We have to tell them that in the 
Community, we will have to make an effort to support their 
income. Without the farmers, Europe would not be this model of 
political and social stability. 
  [Duque] What will your election program aimed at beating the 
PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] be based on? 
  [Matutes] On a common platform passed by the European 
People's Party meeting in Brussels on 8 and 9 December and 
attended by Kohl, Lubber, and Aznar...the main European leaders. 
It is a program of the European center right with a Spanish 
"appendix" that seeks a better and more effective defense of 
Spain's vital interests in Europe. It is based on improving 
infrastructures, with solid economic aid...in a more active, 
more dynamic Europe, with greater participation by businesses 
and society...in a less bureaucratic, less interventionist 
Europe, a Europe that is less expensive and that has fewer 
taxes. These are the center-right programs of the governments in 
the Community's most advanced countries, all except Greece and 
Spain. 
  [Duque] Is the PP staking its future on these elections? It 
is said that if you beat the PSOE, you could force them to move 
up the general elections. 
  [Matutes] The PP now represents hope for millions of 
Spaniards. A victory would be a confirmation of that hope and 
trust which the PP awakens in society. Now then, this does not 
mean that a victory by us in those European elections will imply 
that we are asking that the general elections be moved up. 
However, it will mean a confirmation of a serious, responsible, 
competent alternative that can take over the reins of this 
country and lead it down the path of recovery. 
  [Duque] And if you lose, will it be the end of Aznar, as the 
Socialists are saying? 
  [Matutes] That is not part of our plans. Of course it will 
not be the end of Aznar. He is not the one running, but the 
pre-election polls show us winning.... 
  [Duque] Fine. Aznar is not running, but the PP is, even if 
it 
is headed by you.... 
  [Matutes] If we should lose, we would suffer the 
consequences 
of the errors we have made. 
  [Duque] Certain regional parties like the PAR [Aragon 
Regionalist Party], which could support the PP in Europe, have 
united behind a common candidate.... Will that take votes away 
from the PP? 
  [Matutes] I do not see why a coalition of regional forces 
with frequently conflicting interests would better defend the 
interests of that region than a group of European deputies from 
the same region who are on PP lists. I do not see the 
improvement. Regional interests will be better defended by 
people from the PP. For example, it was I who was behind the 
approval of the Somport tunnel linking the Autonomous Community 
of Aragon with France through the Pyrenees, as a project of 
Community interest. 
  [Duque] Fine, but tell me what you have done for the 
Autonomous Communities of Spain in Europe, one by one.... 
  [Matutes] Fine! I have already told you about Aragon. In 
Baleares, which does not have access to FEDER [European Regional 
Development Fund (of the EEC)] funds because its per capita is 
above the Community average, we succeeded in getting 5B funds 
for farmers in the entire region. We also passed improvements 
for the Ibiza, Mallorca, and Menorca airports.... In addition, 
60 to 70 percent of the funds used for port improvements will 
come from the Community.... 
  [Duque] And what have you done for the Canary Islands? 
  [Matutes] For the Canary Islands, we passed the common 
market 
organization for bananas, protection for tomatoes from winter 
imports, and aid for infrastructures. 
  [Duque] And for the Basque Country? 
  [Matutes] For the Basque Country, I obtained structural 
funds 
to finance conversions and fought very hard in the Commission 
when the plan to reorganize the Spanish iron-and-steel industry 
tried to take the little Sestao steel plant away from us, 
leaving us without a single kilo of Basque steel.... 
  [Duque] What about Asturias? 
  [Matutes] I have just passed the coal assistance code that 
will enable coal mining to continue to receive enough aid to 
make it to the year 2004, which is when the CECA [Economic Coal 
and Steel Community] Treaty will have to be revised.... I have 
not neglected a single Community and I could make a list. For 
nearly nine years now, there have been many projects for which I 
have fought and worked hard for the regions of Spain.... 
  [Duque] What about Castille-Leon? 
  [Matutes] We managed to get FEDER funds for infrastructure 
projects such as highways and helped protect cynegetic species. 
  [Duque] What about Fraga's Galicia? 
  [Matutes] It has benefited from all Community funds for 
improving infrastructures.... I have worked to open up talks 
with third countries so that Galician fishermen could conserve 
and build up fishing grounds. We are now fighting to see that 
cattlemen are not hurt by milk quotas throughout the northern 
corner.... 
  [Duque] And Andalusia, which will also hold autonomous 
elections on 12 June? 
  [Matutes] I have supported all infrastructures built. The 
famous highways, the Despenaperros Pass, were built with 
European aid.... 
  [Duque]] And what did you do for Madrid? 
  [Matutes] Well, since income is high there, it does not have 
access to FEDER funds, but we did obtain it for the surrounding 
belt of industrial towns.... 
  [Duque] And Castille-La Mancha? 
  [Matutes] The same is true. Highways and infrastructure 
projects were financed. The AVE, which benefits that region and 
Andalusia as well, was built with Community financing.... 
  [Duque] What about Valencia? 
  [Matutes] Like the Canary Islands, it continues to receive 
FEDER funds despite its high income. Those funds were renewed 
and certain fruit and produce schedules were extended to winter 
periods.... 
  [Duque] And Murcia? 
  [Matutes] The same is true. It receives structural funds, 
funds for highways. 
  [Duque] And Catalonia? 
  [Matutes] We gave it aid from FEDER funds and it will soon 
have the AVE connecting it with the center of Spain and the rest 
of Europe.... 
  [Duque] What about Extremadura? 
  [Matutes] There are the FEDER funds to improve the 
infrastructure and the reforestation plan.... 
  [Duque] La Rioja? 
  [Matutes] It also gets FEDER funds, help for wine.... 
  [Duque] And Navarre? 
  [Matutes] The connection with France and the Community via a 
direct highway, without going through Velate.... 
  [Duque] And what about Cantabria? What have you done for 
that 
autonomous community that has become poorer with the EC, like 
many other communities? 
  [Matutes] Cantabria has the same problem as Galicia and 
Asturias, with the surtax on milk production. That is because of 
the poor information which the government provided at the time 
about real milk production and we are now paying the 
consequences. However, we hope to rectify the situation, improve 
its highways....

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Election Campaign Over Welfare"] </F>
  [Text] The government wants to be the guardian of the 
welfare state in the upcoming elections. After the government's 
meeting at Toruplund in North Zealand, Prime Minister Poul Nyrup 
Rasmussen announced that he wanted to create a program that 
would give Danes a better and more secure daily life. We know 
this. For it to be necessary to defend, there must be attackers. 
The prime minister must believe, then, that the opposition is 
out to sabotage or at least diminish the welfare society we have 
today. 
  Now we might ask ourselves if the currently existing welfare 
state is really the best possible one of its kind. And we might 
also well ask if the nonsocialists are such formidable reformers 
that there is reason to take on the role of the defender of 
welfare. To be honest, 10 years of governments under 
nonsocialist leadership did not shake the foundations of 
society, regardless of how shrilly SiD [Special Workers Union] 
chairman Hardy Hansen lamented over the social mass grave while, 
at the same time, investing 180 million tax-subsidized kroner in 
a campaign to overthrow the nonsocialist government and return 
the Social Democrats to power. 
  But it was not Hardy's millions that paved the way for the 
Social Democrats' return to power. It was Poul Schluter's 
(debatable) decision to go without Folketing elections that made 
possible Rasmussen's majority government. And one might ask if 
the majority government's performance has given it the right to 
play the role of the welfare society's defender. 
  Moreover, we do not know if the government as such will 
defend the welfare state or if each of the four parties 
individually wants to assume the role of the good that will 
defend the people against evil. Why wait until after the 
elections to protect the people? There are plenty of 
opportunities now to take charge and demonstrate their good 
will. Start, for example, by taking Agriculture Minister Bjorn 
Westh by the collar for his shocking lack of a sense of justice. 
In connection with the payment of land subsidies to farmers, 
some payments were reduced and, of course, the farmers asked for 
compensation. But yesterday Westh refused to pay compensation, 
with the remarkable justification that if he did, then 
compensation would also have to be paid elsewhere when the 
government reduced payments. 
  If this arrogant behavior by Bjorn Westh is truly the 
government's version of a secure life for the people, then 
almost any alternative would be preferable. The government is 
tough when it comes to making people pay their debts to it and 
it demands interest on overdue payments from the second they are 
overdue, plus a minimum of several hundred kroner in late fees. 
But that is only when someone owes the state. The opposite 
situation is a burden to welfare -- the welfare of the state, 
that is.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Away From Middle Policy"] </F>
  [Text] When this year's Folketing elections arrive, for 
once people will have a choice between two clear alternatives, 
each of which will lead us away from the political middle, 
either in the Social Democratic direction or the nonsocialist 
direction. This is an interesting development and it will be the 
beginning of an era in which the traditional consensus, with 
compromises with the middle parties, will be replaced by more 
ideologically flavored solutions. The broad majorities will no 
longer decide. On the other hand, legislation will be more 
temporary and what is approved by one Folketing may be thrown 
out by the next, even if it is a matter of far-reaching reforms. 
  Thus, Danes must get used to the idea that political reality 
can change faster than fickle spring weather. 
  The Social Democratic grouping includes the four present 
coalition parties. There has not yet been any clear indication 
as to whether these four parties will enter the election 
campaign as a unit, but since all four parties are expressing 
enthusiasm over their performance this past year, they must 
believe that the voters will reward them with a mandate for 
another four years in power. Continued cooperation among the 
coalition parties with support from SF [Socialist People's 
Party] seems to be Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's only chance to remain 
as the government's leader. And he is willing to go a long way, 
an extremely long way, to retain the title of prime minister. 
However, he will experience the same kind of schism that Poul 
Schluter faced as the head of his government: Entering the 
elections with the idea of continued coalition government means 
that governmental cooperation must be placed before party 
egotism. That is something that burned the Conservatives and it 
will be no different for the Social Democrats that, as the party 
that sets the tone, must demonstrate its good will by giving the 
small coalition parties preferential treatment and by stressing 
the government in its entirety rather than the party's own 
virtues. 
  Despite the possible problems, Rasmussen has no real 
alternative to acting as a unifying force, even to the detriment 
of his own party. Both the Radical Liberals and the Democratic 
Center, each in its own way, have announced their desire and 
willingness to continue under Rasmussen's leadership, even 
though the polls do not give the coalition much chance to 
survive beyond Christmas. Typically, it is more difficult to get 
a statement out of the Christian People's Party, but it is 
probable that the Christian People's Party, too, is geared 
toward continuing in the coalition with the Social Democrats, 
assuming that the party receives the minimum percentage required 
for representation in Folketing. This is every bit as true for 
the Democratic Center. Paradoxically, it is the small middle 
parties, which traditionally favor the broadest possible 
cooperation, that are now forcing the creation of political 
blocs. Not only have these parties used a simple majority to 
reform tax and labor market policy, but now they are actually 
warning the nonsocialist opposition of the calamities that would 
befall the nation if they, in a similar manner, would utilize a 
fragile majority that would include the Progress Party. 
  This is hypocrisy with a vengeance. The government itself 
set 
the tone, so it does no good to become angry if others play the 
same tune. The opposition, too, has no common foundation on 
which to form a government. It will probably present an 
alternative budget in August, but even now there are clear 
differences. The Liberals have presented an extensive tax plan 
and now the Conservatives have come out with an economic 
package, the essence of which is a strong investment in 
education and research and tax changes that are clearly aimed at 
creating growth in the private sector. 
  The fact that each party has its own plan could create the 
impression that the opposition is split. But there is nothing 
wrong with independent parties having their own independent 
plans and independent programs. But there should be no doubt 
that the Liberals and the Conservatives can and will work 
together when the parliamentary prerequisites are in place. For 
decades Danish politics have been characterized by nonsocialist 
majorities that, due to a lack of willingness to cooperate, 
turned the power over to the Social Democrats. The last decade 
has shown that nonsocialist Denmark is capable of offering an 
alternative, even though some of the legislation from the last 
10 years of governments looks more like the art of the possible 
rather than nonsocialist ideology. 
  This noon when the government holds its news conference 
after 
two days of strategy meetings at Toruplund in North Zealand, it 
would be nice to hear whether the government plans to face the 
voters as the four musketeers with a self-imposed common destiny 
or if they choose to operate with a hidden agenda until all the 
votes are counted.

<F P=106> [Article by Erik Bjorn Moller and Bent Winther: "Schluter's </F>
Successor"] 
  [Excerpts] "I do not regard myself as God's gift to the 
Conservative Party," says party chairman Hans Engell. 
  He calls Poul Schluter's decision not to call an election 
after the Tamil report came out "correct and historically 
decisive. Otherwise we would have been pariahs in Danish 
politics for many years." 
  Engell also criticizes Danish politicians for not being 
competent enough. 
  He is rotund and well liked. His door is "always open." And 
both friends and foes make use of his availability. "Hans is 
someone you can rely on." 
  Thursday, 17 February: The Center Democrats (CD) were 
fighting for the party's life after the Juncker affair. The 
worst crisis in the party's history was raging. 
  A meeting of the Folketing group and the party's cabinet 
ministers was scheduled at 1700 hours in a fresh attempt to pick 
up the pieces. The eight CD members were frustrated and deeply 
divided. 
  That morning, in the middle of the tumult, CD tax 
spokesperson Sonja Albrink went to see Conservative leader Hans 
Engell. She wanted some advice, under pressure as she was from 
deposed Social Affairs Minister Bente Juncker, who wanted her 
post as tax spokesperson back. At the same time she inquired 
about the possibility of switching to the Conservative Party. 
Engell was interested -- but warned Albrink of the personal 
costs. 
  Twelve hours later Albrink got her way -- she stayed on as 
tax spokesperson and remained a CD member. 
  Engell sits at the end of his conference table. Long rows of 
regimental emblems from most of the world -- from his time as 
defense minister -- decorate one wall of the office and green 
plants and bookcases make the office look like a livingroom. 
  "The idea of having just a personal computer, a desk and 
nothing more -- that isn't really me," says the 45-year-old 
Engell. 
  He also has all the volumes of the Tamil report -- placed at 
floor level beside two empty shell cases. Enough powder has been 
used on that matter. 
  After a good half-year as undisputed political leader of the 
Conservative Party, Engell has changed his style. Politicians 
and ministers -- including those from other parties -- often 
call him up for advice. 
  "My respect for people like Mimi Jakobsen and Marianne 
Jelved 
as politicians has not diminished just because we currently find 
ourselves on opposite sides." 
  It is not just physically that he has become rounder. He has 
become older, friendlier, and more forthcoming. More avuncular 
or purely and simply: more like Schluter. 
  And it is quite deliberate. 
  "As minister I dealt with defense and the justice system, 
and 
it meant that I often acted in hard political contexts. Many 
voters perceived this as meaning that I was only interested in 
squatter demonstrations, refugees, tanks, and prisons. One is 
often identified with what one works with, and therefore I have 
made a deliberate effort to show that these are not the only 
things that interest me." 
  When he pounds on the table at meetings of the party's 
Folketing group or makes some remark he often hears people say: 
"Now you sound just like Schluter!" 
  "I am always a little doubtful whether this is unconditional 
praise or if it contains an element of criticism. I choose to 
see it as praise." 
  Since the Tamil report dropped on the party like a bomb a 
little over a year ago, the Conservatives have lived a somewhat 
retiring existence at Christiansborg [parliament building]. Ever 
since Engell had to hand over the keys to the Justice Ministry 
and the two ministerial cars -- Ford Scorpios -- to his Social 
Democratic successor a little over 13 months ago he has had to 
approach his job with a certain amount of humility, in his own 
words. 
  "I think we have now paid the price. People are sick and 
tired of the Tamil affair, but compared with the other parties 
it has been expensive for us. After the course of events last 
January it was proper for the Conservative Party to show a 
certain degree of humility so we could earn back the central 
position we had in the 1980's. And now we are back on course," 
Engell says. 
  At the same time he disputes Liberal chairman Uffe 
Ellemann-Jensen's well-known criticism of the fact that Poul 
Schluter did not call an election after Supreme Court Justice 
Mogens Hornslet issued the Tamil report. 
  "The decision Schluter made was entirely correct and 
historically decisive for the Conservative Party. If we had 
chosen to call an election, we would have been pariahs in Danish 
politics for many years. The other parties would have felt we 
had taken advantage of the situation to score political points. 
We thought what stood in the report was totally unfair, but -- 
as a party based on respect for the courts -- the Conservative 
Party cannot engage in a confrontation with both the Supreme 
Court and the political system." 
  Engell's working day is about as long as it was when he was 
justice minister. It begins at 0800 on the coastal train from 
Espergaerde in North Zealand when he reads reports and political 
speeches on his way in to Christiansborg. He is seldom through 
in the Folketing before 2000 or 2030 at night and most evenings 
are taken up with meetings around the country. 
  From a job as journalist with BERLINGSKE TIDENDE Hans Engell 
became press officer for the Conservatives at Christiansborg in 
1978. In September 1982 he was asked to come to Prime Minister 
Schluter's office. He thought an ordinary briefing lay ahead. A 
short time later he was the country's defense minister -- at age 
33. 
  He was part of the inner circle around the party leader 
during the party's golden years in the 1980's -- until he took 
over the post himself last year. 
  Today he describes 14 January 1993, when the Tamil report 
came out and Schluter decided to drop the reins, as the darkest 
day in his political career. Not so much because of his own 
political ambitions but his ambitions on behalf of the 
party. 
  "I was there in the days when everything succeeded. Schluter 
became prime minister in the Conservative Party's great and 
stirring period. We had exciting and challenging tasks for 10 
years and suddenly we ran into a large roadblock. It distressed 
me on Schluter's behalf because it was so unfair. He had served 
Denmark as a wise and capable leader and then it all had to end 
because of something he basically had nothing to do with. 
  ``In addition, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen succeeded in 
establishing 
a majority government with a number of our partners for 10 
years. Suddenly they were driving around in ministers' cars. The 
prospects definitely did not look bright. But it quickly became 
apparent that the present government was far from invulnerable. 
And nonsocialist Denmark was not relegated to the sidelines for 
a long period of time after all,'' Engell asserts. 
  He does not rule out the possibility that the Liberals and 
Conservatives can form a government again after a September 
election. 
  "But it will not be easy. Sixteen seats must change hands. 
But if someone had asked me a year ago, I would have been much 
more skeptical than I am now." 
  Today the Conservatives are moving up in the polls again -- 
and Schluter has reestablished himself by beginning a new 
political life as the party's leading candidate for the European 
Parliament. 
  Two weeks ago the Conservatives held a European Union (EU) 
seminar at Christiansborg. Engell gave the political 
introduction and afterward felt it natural to ask for a few 
words from the former prime minister, who has represented 
Denmark at EC summit meetings for 10 years. 
  "No, I don't want to say anything. Things are going well and 
Hans knows much more about this than I thought he did," Schluter 
replied. 
  "I have never been sure whether Schluter's subtle remark 
concealed praise or criticism. But it is typical of him." 
  In daily political work Engell seeks advice from Kaj Ikast, 
Niels Ahlmann-Ohlsen, Anne Birgitte Lundholt, Per Stig Moller, 
and Henning Grove, in particular -- as well as the party's 
organizational chairman, Torben Rechendorff, and secretary 
general Peter Sterup. 
  Poul Schluter, on the other hand, stays in the background. 
  "It is a big help that I can consult him, but he is not the 
kind of person who comes running himself. There have been a 
couple of situations I consulted him on later, and he said that 
it was perhaps not exactly what he would have done," Engell says 
with a smile. 
  "Schluter has always been there, you know. If everything 
went 
haywire he always had the ultimate responsibility. I have had to 
get used to the fact that the roles are now different. 
  ``I do not go around thinking of myself as God's gift to the 
Conservative Party. Schluter has taught me not to be pompous, 
but to take the work and the responsibility very seriously. I 
have made this my own style. Personal ambitions must not be 
decisive for political work. When the ambition of holding high 
office becomes an overriding motif there is a risk that one's 
vision will become blurred.'' 
  The unpretentious style is expressed especially in Engell's 
relations with colleagues and journalists. When Prime Minister 
Rasmussen recently briefed the political parties on the 
situation in Bosnia late one evening, Liberal Party chairman 
Uffe Ellemann-Jensen and group chairman Ivar Hansen quickly left 
through the famous glass door without a single comment to the 
few waiting journalists. A little later a relaxed Engell came 
out and told them what had happened at the meeting. Which, 
incidentally, had been quite undramatic. [passage omitted] 
  There have been several scratches on the surface of 
relations 
with the Liberal Party since Schluter, to Ellemann-Jensen's 
great rage, decided to resign as prime minister without calling 
an election. Since then the Liberals have shot up in the polls 
while the Conservatives have looked on enviously. 
  In contrast to the Liberals, the Conservatives have clearly 
abandoned aggressive opposition politics. When Henning Dyremose 
(Conservative) decided to leave his post as political spokesman 
-- and politics in general -- in August, it was after having 
pursued a hard unsuccessful campaign against the government and 
the prime minister on the issue of overcompensation in Tarnby. 
  "We are not elected to the Folketing to sit and look out the 
window and throw spitballs at Rasmussen. We have a majority 
government and our opportunities to exert influence have been 
incredibly limited," Engell says. 
  Then they might just as well throw spitballs -- like the 
Liberals, we suggest. 
  "The Liberals have also presented a number of political 
proposals. But I regard it as the Conservatives' job to be 
critical and constructive. The government has supplied a thin 
stream of issues, scandals, and cabinet changes. There has been 
little need for us to fan the flames. Rasmussen himself has had 
to run around putting out fires from morning till night." 
  Last weekend the Liberals' EU congress approved a program 
that lies far from the Conservative ideas about Europe. 
  "The Liberals and the Conservatives will manifest themselves 
differently on individual political issues. The Liberals said 
yes, we said no to the new elementary education law. The 
Liberals clearly have a more federal aim in European policy, 
while we maintain that there must be cooperation between 
independent autonomous nations. We do not want to make the EU 
Council of Ministers and Parliament into Europe's government and 
parliament. We do not want any bicameral system. When we had the 
negative vote on 2 June it was because we were paying the price 
for having neglected the debate on Europe for 20 years. We 
cannot afford to gamble with Denmark's position. Therefore we 
must assure ourselves of a large and broad political majority 
when we move ahead in the European process," Engell says. 
  When the Liberals and Conservatives went into the opposition 
together, they set up a joint coordinating committee to 
harmonize viewpoints. Even so it is increasingly apparent that 
the two parties have different views about how Denmark should 
develop. 
  And when the Liberals presented a proposal last week to 
lower 
the tax burden by 10 percent within the next 10 years, it met 
with deafening silence from the Conservatives. On the other hand 
the Liberals have not been heard from in connection with the 
Conservatives' latest initiative, which BERLINGSKE TIDENDE can 
unveil today. It is based on increasing the influence of the 
wage-earner funds on Danish economic life. 
  "Many of the Liberal proposals are also solid conservative 
policies. But we have our own proposals. Like close family 
members we can naturally have good friendly fights at times -- 
but we are two completely independent parties and there is a 
healthy and natural competition between us. The moment we 
acquire government responsibility we will put the proposals 
together," Engell says. 
  He has absolutely no wish to speculate about whether a new 
nonsocialist government will be led by either Ellemann-Jensen or 
himself. 
  "The crucial thing is that personal issues do not become a 
problem." 
  Nor has he thought about which ministry post he would like 
if 
he does not become prime minister. Although: "Not justice 
minister, at any rate." Says the former justice minister. 
  He loves to read books. Novels and books about politics and 
history. When he is through with them they are taken over by his 
daughters, aged 20 and 22. 
  Recently he read Peter Olesen's books about architecture in 
Copenhagen. This led to the party becoming the first in this 
country to formulate its own architectural policy. 
  However he does not intend to compete with Ellemann-Jensen 
as 
an angler: 
  "The results one achieves from fishing are often in inverse 
proportion to the amount of time one spends doing it. And there 
are other ways of getting fresh air." 
  One of the books Engell has read with less enthusiasm is 
Liberal Anders Fogh Rasmussen's ideological debate book, 
Fra socialstat til minimalstat [From Social State to 
Minimal State]. 
  "There are many interesting ideas in the book. But I think 
the old parties -- the Social Democrats, the Radicals, the 
Liberals, and the Conservatives -- have a joint responsibility 
for the welfare state we have built up since the war. Most of it 
was carried out with the support of very broad majorities. It 
would be dishonest and in conflict with conservative thinking if 
we now wanted a complete break with the social model for which 
we ourselves have a major responsibility." 
  Despite the different signals from the Liberals and the 
Conservatives, Engell has no doubt that the two parties combined 
represent the only alternative to Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. 
Government cooperation with the Social Democrats or the Social 
Democrats and the Radical Liberals is "totally precluded," and a 
government with the Progress Party is "not realistic" either. 
But if the Liberals, the Conservatives, and the Progress Party 
should constitute a majority after the election, it should be 
utilized for such things as amending the tax reform and the 
labor market reform. 
  But Engell does not consider it very likely that the 
Radicals, CD, or the Christian People's Party (KrF) will return 
to the nonsocialist fold after the next election. 
  "The day will come when they turn toward us. But it will 
take 
a lot for the middle parties to change sides in the coming 
election. 
  ``If we are to regain our full strength it will not be by 
steering a slalom course between changing opinion polls. Even 
though the present government has tempted us almost beyond 
endurance for the past year I have tried to refrain from 
participating in the very personal attacks. I will not seek a 
short-term gain by criticizing something the government does or 
says in situations where I am well aware that one cannot demand 
the impossible,'' Engell says. 
  He attracted attention recently when he praised Prime 
Minister Rasmussen on his return from Malmo after a meeting with 
Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt on the Oresund traffic link. 
  "Nothing is so surprising in Danish politics as the 
government and the opposition praising each other. Naturally it 
must not go too far.... But there is seldom any reason for that." 
  Although Engell thinks Rasmussen is a weak prime minister in 
many ways and lacks the ability to distinguish between big and 
small issues he shows no lack of appreciation for the government 
leader's openness. 
  "Although he heads a majority government, he is good at 
orienting other parties on important political questions. He 
would rather hold too many meetings than too few. And it is very 
hard for me to be mad at him. He has some basically attractive 
human traits." 
  He totally disagrees with CD political spokesman and group 
chairman Peter Duetoft, who strongly criticized the press for 
overstepping ethical limits in connection with the Juncker 
affair. 
  "If there is anyone who cannot be blamed it is the media. On 
the other hand the politicians are much too willing to take a 
stand. And it is characteristic that every time it is necessary 
to think in a long-term perspective the politicians ask a panel 
of experts to look into it. And this kind of review is usually 
written in sand and quickly obliterated. In that way too much of 
the discussion that concerns national development is conducted 
outside the political parties." 
  Is that because the politicians are not capable enough? 
  "Yes! Politicians spend too little time thinking."

  [Text] The government of Finland has welcomed the outcome 
of the vote of the European Parliament on Finland's EU [European 
Union] membership. Prime Minister Esko Aho described the 
outcome of the vote as a positive piece of news, and Foreign 
Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen as a dramatically good result. 
The government was delighted that a larger majority than 
expected of European deputies voted for Finland's membership. 
The government was following the voting by the European 
Parliament at its evening meeting at the Prime Minister's 
residence in Kesaeranta. The government agreed at its meeting 
that the date for the EU national referendum and the size of 
national subsidies will be decided by the 26 May.

  [Text] Helsinki, May 4 (AFP) -- The Finnish Government will 
submit to parliament a date for the referendum on European Union 
(EU) membership by May 26 at the latest, Finnish Prime Minister 
Esko Aho stated Wednesday [4 May]. 
  Aho has previously talked of holding a November referendum, 
while Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari has discussed the 
possibility of a September or October referendum. 
  Sweden will hold its referendum November 13 and Austria on 
June 12. Norway has yet to announce a date. 
  Meanwhile, Finnish Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen, 
who together with Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto negotiated 
Finland's membership agreement in Brussels, said he was pleased 
with the European Parliament's decision Wednesday to admit the 
four applicant countries. 
  "This is a fantastic result if one considers that 259 votes 
were required for membership, and we were well over that by 100 
and there were few opponents," he said.

  [Text] The Palestine Liberation Organization, PLO, would 
like to raise the diplomatic status of its information offices 
in the Nordic countries. The PLO representative in Finland is 
appealing to the Finnish Government to raise the matter at a 
Nordic foreign ministers's meeting which starts in Reykjavik 
tomorrow. The PLO says that if Finland, as the first Nordic 
country, were to set an example in this matter, the Palestinians 
would value this as much as they value the contributions of 
Norway and Sweden in the Middle East peace process.

  [Text] Oslo, May 4 (AFP) -- The European Parliament's 
decision to approve Norway's European Union (EU) membership 
agreement demonstrates that Norway is welcome in the EU, 
Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said Wednesday [4 
May]. 
  "The decision also shows that the parliamentarians support 
the negotiation results, which ensure special Norwegian needs 
such as Norwegian agriculture, an active regional policy and new 
possibilities for support for fisheries," she said. 
  The European Parliament accepted Norway's agreement 
Wednesday 
with 374 votes out of 456. 
  Meanwhile, Norwegian Trade Minister Grete Knudsen, who was 
responsible for negotiating the EU agreement in Brussels, said 
Wednesday that a date for the Norwegian referendum would be 
decided upon by May 27. 
  Swedes will vote November 13, Austria June 12, while Finland 
has yet to set a date.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Pshenichnikov] </F>
  [Excerpt] Oslo, 5 May -- Norway has decided not to send its 
military contingent to Nagorno-Karabakh to take part in the 
peacekeeping operation planned by the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe [CSCE], Kirsti Skjerven, an official 
spokesperson of the Norwegian Defense Ministry, told ITAR-TASS 
in an interview. 
  She said that the CSCE had appealed to Norway in March to 
take part in a planned peacekeeping operation in 
Nagorno-Karabakh. After studying this matter and taking into 
account the situation in Bosnia, where Norwegian servicemen form 
part of the UN peacekeeping force, Norway's Defense Ministry 
considered it impossible to allocate a military contingent for a 
peacekeeping mission in the area of the Armenian-Azeri conflict. 
Kirsti Skjerven stressed: "The Ministry of Defense of Norway 
believes that it is necessary to concentrate our peacekeeping 
forces in one place and not scatter them about. The funds 
earmarked by the Norwegian parliament for maintaining 
peacekeeping forces abroad can thus be used in the best way."

<F P=106> [Bjorn Lindahl report: "Nuclear Waste Dump To Be Built </F>
Close to Swedish Border"] 
  [Text] Oslo -- Despite protests from local authorities on 
both sides of the border, yesterday the Norwegian Storting 
decided that a dump for radioactive waste will be built in 
Himdalen, 30 km from the Swedish local authorities of Eda and 
Arjang which lie on the border with Norway. 
  It is waste from Norway's two research reactors which is to 
be stored here, together with low- and medium-level radioactive 
waste from hospitals. A cavern will be constructed under a 
ridge 170 meters above sea level in an area where rock types are 
full of cracks and where drainage water runs out into a river. 
  Environmental organizations and Norwegian Geological 
Investigations, where the foremost geological expertise is to be 
found, have criticized the planned facility and think that there 
is a risk that the radioactive waste will leak out into the 
ground water. The International Atomic Energy Agency has also 
asked to see the Norwegian plans. There was tough criticism of 
Norwegian Industry Minister Jens Stoltenberg during the Storting 
debate. 
  "I have never seen so important a question put before the 
Storting with such inadequate information," Environment 
Committee chairman Ragnhild Queseth Haarstad (Center Party) said. 
  Paul Chaffey from the Socialist Left Party wondered where 
the 
negative comments from the experts had been concealed. 
  "Why has the industry minister not included the comments 
made 
by Sweden's National Nuclear Inspection Board?" he asked. 
  The Storting was divided across party boundaries, but the 
Labor Party won enough support from the Conservative Party and 
the Progress Party for a decision to be reached by 71 votes to 
57. Industry Minister Stoltenberg defended himself by saying 
that it is not the rock around the facility which is to prevent 
radioactive leaks. 
  "The barrels will be cast in concrete casings, and these in 
their turn will be placed in a concrete sarcophagus. If we 
notice that the concrete does not come up to standard or if, 
contrary to expectations, radioactivity does leak out we can 
take the barrels out again," he said. 
  Hitherto the waste from the two research reactors at Halden 
and Kjeller has been stored in 1,000 barrels buried underground 
at the Institute for Energy Technology at Kjeller. A further 
1,500 barrels are in a temporary storage facility. As well as 
low- and medium-level waste, small quantities of plutonium -- 
with a half-life of 24,000 years -- will also have to be stored.

  [Text] [Announcer] After the voting at the European 
Parliament [which voted for Sweden's membership of the EU], 
Prime Minister Carl Bildt was of course pleased. 
  [Begin recording] [Bildt] This is very good news, and this 
means that the last formal obstacle to a quick signing of the 
agreements that make our membership possible from the beginning 
of next year has now been removed. 
  [Correspondent Tomas Ramberg] The biggest obstacle to your 
ambitions to enter the European Union is still there, the 
Swedish nation. Do you think this decision will have some 
influence on opinion in Sweden? 
  [Bildt] I think that possibly it will. There have been many 
who have always said that this will not succeed, it will 
collapse because of this or that, and this was maybe the last 
thing they had pinned some of their hopes on. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The date of the national referendum where the 
Swedish nation will make a decision on EU membership will be 13 
November.

  [Text] Stockholm, May 4 (AFP) -- Swedish European Affairs 
Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel hailed the European Parliament's 
decision Wednesday [4 May] to admit Sweden, Austria, Finland and 
Norway to the European Union (EU). 
  "The Swedish Government welcomes, with great satisfaction, 
the European Parliament's decision to accept the membership 
agreement with Sweden and the three other applicant countries," 
Dinkelspiel said in a statement. 
  "Today's decision means that the decisive factor now lies in 
the hands of the Swedish people," he added. 
  Sweden is expected to hold a referendum on EU membership 
November 13. 
  "Today's decision gives a clear signal to governments and 
people -- both in member countries and applicant countries -- to 
move quickly in forming a united Europe," he said. 
  "In our opinion, Sweden has negotiated a very good agreement 
on membership in the European Union. It is very gratifying that 
the European Parliament today supports this agreement," 
Dinkelspiel concluded.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Carl Bildt by </F>
Elisabeth Holte in Stockholm; no date given] 
  [Text] Stockholm -- "Today Sweden has its natural place in 
Europe and has close ties with more or less all countries. This 
was not always the case in the past!" 
  Prime Minister Carl Bildt did not hesitate with his answer 
and did not fail to include a little dig at his predecessors 
when AFTENPOSTEN asked him what is the difference between 
Swedish foreign and security policy today and five or 10 years 
ago. 
  To be honest, he made more digs at the Social Democrats' 
foreign policy priorities and their greater interest in radical 
regimes in the developing countries than at the new situation in 
Europe. For in practice the election campaign is already under 
way. 
  Bildt has always been interested in foreign policy. And so 
closely does the prime minister involve himself in foreign 
policy that you can hear people in Stockholm say that poor 
Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas has a boss who would 
ideally like to be doing her job! 
  As Bildt sees it, Sweden will retain its military 
nonalignment for the foreseeable future, at the same time as 
Swedish EU [European Union] membership will increase Sweden's 
security. However, he reiterated as recently as last week in a 
debate in the Riksdag that it is not as easy for Sweden to 
become a member of the WEU [Western European Union]. 
  "But Sweden is very interested in being able to follow the 
work of the WEU as an observer -- something which represents no 
military commitments, but which offers an opportunity to 
participate in peacemaking activities, for example," he said. 
  According to Bildt, Sweden will not try to slow down a trend 
toward common European defenses. But the prime minister's 
answer is always a resounding "no" when he is asked at EU debate 
meetings whether a private from Norrland runs the risk of being 
sent against his will to fight in the Balkans for example, if 
Sweden joins the EU. And he is keen to remind his audiences 
that Germany and France, which have been cooperating longest, 
have so far not reached agreement on a common tank, let alone a 
common army. 
  The Baltic region and Russia is another topic in which Bildt 
takes a personal interest. 
  In the three years he has been prime minister -- and the 
three Baltic countries have been independent -- he has played an 
unusually active role as a go-between and sometimes even 
mediator in Baltic-Russian affairs. 
  This week he has again been in the firing line because of 
the 
Baltic region -- this time in the Riksdag's Constitutional 
Committee -- because of his remark a while ago to the effect 
that Sweden will not sit and look on passively if the Baltic 
countries' independence were to be threatened. Sweden will lend 
its support -- particularly political support. 
  Such talk was too much for some -- particularly opposition 
parties which had not been consulted and which took the view 
that the prime minister was promising more support than a 
neutral Sweden could in practice give. The Riksdag committee 
wanted to follow the matter up and find out whether, in the 
event of a crisis in the Baltic, Sweden should remain neutral 
militarily, or make soldiers and aircraft available, as it did 
in Finland during the Winter War. 
  "We will give political support, and sanctions could become 
an option. We will not allow ourselves to be forced, as we were 
in 1940, to betray our neighbors," Bildt said. 
  Why do you give such a high priority to marking support for 
the Baltic countries? 
  "Because what is happening on the other side of the Baltic 
Sea has such great significance for Sweden's security and 
economic policy. There are few things which are more important 
for peace in Europe as a whole, and for us here in the Nordic 
area in particular, than the development of the democratic 
reform process in Russia. We have seen what it was like to be 
the neighbor of the Soviet Union which was a dictatorship and an 
overmilitarized superpower. Now we have the chance to get a 
democratic Russia with a market economy which fully respects 
three independent nations along the eastern coast of the 
Baltic," said Bildt, eager to send a signal to the red-brown 
revanchists in Russia that the Balts have friends who follow 
events.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that the European 
Union [EU] should tell the Greek Cypriots that they cannot join 
the Union so long as they do not reach an agreement with the 
Turkish Cypriots. 
  Denktas today received the U.S. ambassador to Lefkosa 
[Nicosia] Richard Boucher and conferred with him for some time. 
The U.S. Embassy under secretary was also present at the 
meeting. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that he told 
Boucher that the Republican Assembly, at its Cyprus debate 
yesterday, expressed support for him regarding the principles he 
stressed he would not be making any concessions on. He further 
noted that he informed the ambassador that the parties 
represented at the Assembly share his view that the package of 
confidence-building measures [CBM's] has been punctured and that 
it cannot be implemented in its current form. Denktas said: I 
clearly told him that the ball is now in Kliridhis' court, that 
the holes in the package have to be mended, and that the second 
map is unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  In reply to a question by a journalist on whether his 
meeting 
with Boucher is the beginning of a new process, Denktas said 
that he might consider it to be so but that circles interested 
in the Cyprus issue have, anyway, not accepted that the process 
is over. Pointing out that it will be wrong to assume that the 
Cyprus problem can be solved within a short period and that the 
Turkish Cypriots will be left in peace, Denktas stressed that he 
has very clearly expressed the views of the Turkish Cypriot side 
but that they should be put forward even more clearly. Noting 
that the circles interested in the Cyprus issue will, thus, 
understand what can be solved and what cannot, Denktas added: 
We have to explain to the world in detail on which parameters 
and milestones we shall insist. Denktas drew attention to the 
fact that the message being given to the Greek Cypriots that 
they can still join the EU if an agreement is not reached due to 
the failure of the Turkish Cypriot side gives the Greek Cypriots 
the opportunity to play the game of throwing the ball into the 
Turkish Cypriot court each time. Denktas said: I cannot 
concede each time to prevent Kliridhis from playing this game. 
No matter how flexible I am the result is still the same. What 
kind of a game is this? We are only helping Kliridhis join the 
EU. Europe has to be told that they should inform the Greek 
Cypriots that this game will not prove to be successful. Europe 
should tell the Greek Cypriots that the door to the EU is closed 
to them. 
  Denktas said that he told the UN secretary general that a 
decision should be reached through a referendum to be held on 
both sides. He added that so long as the Greek Cypriots are not 
informed of this the carrot to be given to the Greek Cypriots 
will prove to be a very big stick for the Turkish Cypriots. 
Denktas stressed that no results can be achieved at the 
negotiations by giving hope to the Greek Cypriots and 
threatening the Turkish Cypriots. 
  In reply to a question, Denktas said that the Republican 
Assembly is the best national platform and that the government 
will do whatever is necessary to expand the unity within the 
assembly.

  [Text] Turkey has prepared a plan to occupy all of Cyprus 
and has asked Islamic countries for support. Two of them have 
already replied positively. 
  The Arab newspaper AL MUHARRIR, which is published in Paris, 
has revealed this information crediting well-informed Turkish 
diplomatic sources. The newspaper adds that, according to the 
Turkish sources, Cyprus has been selected as a center for 
laundering dirty money made from drug trafficking, secret arms 
selling, and violations of the embargo against Yugoslavia. They 
also claim that there is cooperation between Russia, Yugoslavia, 
and Cypriot Orthodox people to suppress the Muslims.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos by </F>
Vanna Vannuccini in Athens; date not given: "Pangalos Against 
Everyone: `Europe Weak and Divided'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Vannuccini] Minister, do you 
believe that the dispute between Athens and Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is moving toward a 
solution after the meeting between Andreas Papandreou and 
President Clinton? 
  [Pangalos] I was not one of those who expected much to come 
from this trip. Bilateral relations have improved, and that is 
a good thing. But the basic question is: What policy does the 
United States want to take: a policy of relationships of force, 
or a policy of principles? Initially, Clinton looked more like 
he wanted to go the second way, but.... To put it clearly, a 
policy of relationships of force means oil, particular attention 
to Islam, and hence a search for solutions, the principal 
criterion of which is the relationship with Islam. In the 
Balkans too. We in Greece have very bitter experience of 
American policy of relationships of force. The aggression in 
Cyprus was tolerated, if not even organized, by the United 
States. Hence, when one talks of the "dangerous Serb precedent" 
in Yugoslavia, we agree, certainly, but ethnic cleansing and the 
violation of human rights and of borders is something we have 
known in Cyprus for 20 years now. 
  [Vannuccini] This is why you do not trust the Europeans on 
the Skopje question? 
  [Pangalos] Look, the problem of Skopje exists, and it is not 
we who invented it. They tell us that it also existed before. 
But previously Macedonia was not a state. There were two 
provinces, a Macedonian province in Greece and a Macedonian 
province in Yugoslavia. I do not question that Skopje is a part 
of geographic Macedonia. But now that they are a state, it 
seems to me that they are the true Macedonians. And this poses 
a problem. It Tessin [southern Swiss province bordering on 
Italy] declared itself independent and called itself the state 
of Lombardy, this would create a problem for the Milanese, would 
it not? 
  [Vannuccini] Probably also for the inhabitants of Skopje, 
who 
have considered themselves to be Macedonian for the past 50 
years. Assuming another name is a problem. 
  [Pangalos] No, and I will explain to you why. First of all, 
they do not see themselves as Macedonians, but as Yugoslavs. 
Yugoslavia was something real, even if today we speak of it as 
if it had not existed. Moreover, a third, and possibly more of 
the inhabitants considered themselves, and continue to consider 
themselves, to be Albanian. Of the other two-thirds, one 
minority saw itself as Macedonian, and another believed itself, 
and still believes itself to be Bulgarian. Just think that the 
second largest party in Skopje has its headquarters in Sofia. 
Things are not simple. Greece is afraid of political 
instability. And this is something very real. The Skopjans 
have problems with the Serbs, with the Albanians, and with the 
Bulgarians. The Albanians have problems with the Serbs, with 
the Skopjans, and now they are trying to create problems with us 
as well. Everyone has problems with everyone else. Not to 
mention Turkey. Greece wants to stay out of the Balkan game. 
For this reason I wish to solve the question rapidly, so that 
there are no future claims of any kind. Why are the Skopjans 
insisting on their positions? Answer me. 
  [Vannuccini] Probably because a name based on geography is 
less risky for a country with so many different ethnic groups. 
  [Pangalos] Is this why they are insisting also on the 
articles of the constitution and pretend to have a "droit de 
regard" [a right to oversee] our Macedonians, whom they view as 
"compatriots who speak Greek." The rule in the Balkans has 
always been that whenever a regime fails to resolve the problems 
of its own people, it creates problems outside. If you do not 
know that, you understand nothing about the region. 
  [Vannuccini] Can you please recapitulate the Greek position 
for me. What did Papandreou say to Clinton? 
  [Pangalos] We told [FYROM President] Gligorov that, 
simultaneously, we would lift the embargo and he would remove 
the Vergina sun from the flag and make a declaration that the 
articles of the constitution have no further meaning than a 
historical text. We would guarantee our existing borders to each 
other -- we are also prepared to guarantee Skopje its borders 
with the other neighboring countries -- and at the same time we 
would remove our veto to their entry into the CSCE and adopt the 
economic aid program. Two things are still left out: They say 
that it is a Macedonian minority in Greece, and on this item we 
can refer to the Council of Europe rules. And then there is the 
question of the name: Here we can admit the existence of a 
reciprocal right, and begin negotiations. We expect the 
Europeans to place pressure on Skopje. But Europe does not care 
less about Greek concerns. There is a total distance. Greeks 
can only record this and draw from it very negative conclusions. 
  [Vannuccini] Which? 
  [Pangalos] Europe is divided and weak. There are countries 
which make policy and countries which are subject to policy. Do 
not fool yourself that Italy has a policy. Look, we have no 
intention of playing this game to the bitter end. 
  [Vannuccini] Are you referring to the recognition of the 
former Yugoslav republics? 
  [Pangalos] It seems to me that the Germans themselves are 
becoming aware that the recognition of Bosnia was premature. 
The Greek Government should have exercised its veto. It was 
clear from the outset that the Serbs would not have accepted a 
Muslim Bosnia. To imagine a minority of Catholics and Orthodox 
accepting a Muslim power is to be unacquainted with the Balkans. 
When the Balkan peoples say Muslim, they mean Turk, and Turkish 
power is still alive in their mind. Because it was an 
indescribable power. It is not comparable with the Austrian 
occupation of Italy or the Swedish occupation of Denmark, as my 
Danish colleague suggested, demonstrating how little he 
understood of the situation. The Turkish power was barbarian. 
It was not Islam, mind you, but a Mongol power. Attila, 
Tamburlaine. Perhaps the Turks do not yet consider them as 
heroes? A Turk was allowed to rape children whom he met on the 
street, to kill whomever he wanted. The Greeks never ceased 
combating them. I belong to a Greek Albanian-speaking minority 
from an area of Mount Parnassos, in Attica, where the Turks 
never managed to set foot. 
  [Vannuccini] Greeks often see things less in terms of errors 
of judgment by certain European countries, and more in terms of 
obscure designs of political and economic penetration. Do you 
share this analysis? 
  [Pangalos] I do not think that these designs are dark at 
all. 
They are extremely clear. Certain people preferred to have weak 
and easily influenceable countries in the south of the Balkans. 
Divide and conquer. 
  [Vannuccini] What type of solution do you see then for 
Bosnia? 
  [Pangalos] We need to turn to the European level. The 
territorial status quo. With small changes, but without losing 
more time seeking to change it substantially. 
  [Vannuccini] Leaving the Serbs with more than 70 percent of 
the territory? 
  [Pangalos] What does 70 percent mean? This figure includes 
the mountains. And what then is the alternative: to arm 
everyone and hope for a Muslim victory? And then impose a 
Muslim state on the Serbs? There are no military paths, only 
the path of negotiation. 
  [Vannuccini] But did you not say that one must reject 
relationships of force? 
  [Pangalos] The situation here is different, because we have 
recognized Yugoslavia's internal borders as international 
borders. We need to redraw the borders, respecting 
nationalities, and then seek to remake Yugoslavia -- a 
confederation, something which will enable these people to live 
together. I know that what I am saying can appear absurd, but 
it is less so than it might seem. 
  [Vannuccini] Greece has a bad image in Europe, also because 
of its financial mess, but it has done nothing to remedy the 
situation. 
  [Pangalos] We have an austerity plan, and we need to apply 
it 
with firmness. Certainly Greece poses problems for Europe 
because it will not allow the Maastricht Treaty to go ahead. 
But it is not alone. Is Maastricht possible without Italy? I 
do not think so. And in any event, it is not, as some people 
say, that the money is going out of the pockets of North 
Europeans who work and into the pockets of Greeks who do 
nothing. I have had a balance sheet prepared of the give and 
take in 15 years of Community membership. And I can assure you 
that these calculations are difficult to do: money transfers can 
be calculated because they are visible sums, but other 
parameters are difficult to put into figures. Greece is a major 
importer of Northern European products. The transfers are for 
investments, three-quarters of which return to European 
industry. If the calculations are done, we will have some 
surprises.

  [Text] Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand 
National Assembly, who concluded his official visit to France as 
the guest of his French counterpart, has returned to Turkey. In 
a statement at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, Cindoruk said that 
during his visit, he held positive and fruitful meetings with 
the French president, parliamentary officials, and 
representatives of political parties. 
  Noting that he held a one and-a-half-hour meeting with 
French 
President Francois Mitterrand, Cindoruk remarked that the 
meeting yielded beneficial and important results for Turkey. 
Cindoruk said that during the meeting, he had the opportunity 
to respond to some of Mitterrand's views and concerns. Cindoruk 
stated: I believe that I was able to explain Turkey's problems 
to him properly. There is no concern with regard to our 
country's democratization and human rights and its close ties to 
West Europe. If there were any reasons for concern on these 
subjects, they were presented to us and we offered the necessary 
explanations.

  [Text] Hans Stercken, chairman of the German Bundestag 
Foreign Affairs Committee, has announced that his country has 
lifted the ban on arms deliveries to Turkey. Stercken, who is 
conducting various contacts in Ankara, met with Interior 
Minister Nahit Mentese today. 
  In a statement during the meeting, Stercken said that the 
arms deliveries are not undertaken only in accordance with the 
agreements between Turkey and Germany but also within the 
framework of NATO agreements. 
  In turn, Mentese noted that the arms deliveries were 
suspended as a result of pressure from German public opinion, 
adding that the lifting of the ban is a welcome development. 
Stating that German weapons are not being used in the struggle 
against the terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
organization in south and southeast Anatolia, Mentese remarked 
that there are no restrictions on where and when the weapons 
should be used.

  [Text] Ankara--Parliamentary sources said Thursday [28 
April] that the recent friction between the United States and 
Turkey on emptying the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline could 
jeopardize a new extension of the mandate for coalition forces 
based in Turkey to protect the Iraqi Kurds. 
  The debate was highlighted after Turkish Foreign Minister 
Hikmet Cetin met with Ambassador Madeleine Albright, U.S. 
permanent representative to the United Nations, in Washington on 
Wednesday. 
  Albright reportedly expressed American concern over the 
possibility of a violation of the U.N. embargo on Iraq, while 
Cetin said he had fully assured the United States that Turkey 
had no such intention. 
  Cetin recalled on Thursday though that Turkey was a country 
which had been affected most by Gulf War losses and that its 
direct and indirect losses had already reached $20 billion. 
"Despite this," he said, "I told Albright that Turkey was 
acting according to U.N. decisions." 
  Turkey is currently concerned that the Karkuk-Yumurtalik 
pipeline is being damaged owing to its closure which has been in 
effect since 1990 and wants to pump out the oil contained in the 
pipeline. In Cetin's words, such an effort would not be a 
violation of the sanctions but should be interpreted as only 
maintenance work. 
  In early April, Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary 
Ozdem 
Sanberk visited Baghdad where the Iraqi side agreed to Turkey 
emptying the pipeline, leading to a strong reaction from the 
United States. 
  Last weekend, U.S. Ambassador to Ankara Richard Barkley 
visited Sanberk at the Foreign Ministry and reportedly told him 
that a Turkish initiative to be taken on this issue without any 
consultations could create problems in keeping promises which 
had earlier been given to this country. 
  The Turkish press has dubbed these remarks as a "warning" or 
a "note." Foreign Ministry officials prefer to refer to them as 
"an American initiative." 
  Turkey argues that there are about 12 million barrels of oil 
in the pipeline, which is now corroding away, and an amount 
equivalent to 7.5 million barrels on the Turkish side of the 
border. Along with the 2 million barrels in tanks in 
Yumurtalik, the amount of oil on the Turkish side is currently 
at around 9.5 million barrels or the equivalent of $60 million. 
  The 986-kilometer pipeline extends from Karkuk in Iraqi 
territory to Turkey and 641-kilometers of the line runs inside 
Turkish territory. Daily capacity before the closure was 
1,200,000 barrels of crude oil or an annual 70.9 million tons of 
crude. 
  Unless a solution can be found to the crisis, Turkey will 
continue to lose some $5 billion a year and in Cetin's words, 
"This is leading to feelings that Turkey is being punished." 
The effects of these feelings have, in turn, been evident among 
the Turkish electorate, leading rapidly to reactions in 
Parliament. 
  Hints have been given that in the upcoming June meeting, 
which is to decide on extending the mandate of the coalition 
forces based in Turkey, Parliament is to take into account the 
American attitude on its project to empty the pipeline and for 
Turkey to use the 3.5 million barrels which it owns. 
  According to political sources in Parliament, even if Ciller 
puts pressure on her group to extend the mandate, the reaction 
of the electorate will be stronger this time, turning the debate 
into the most difficult of all. 
  Turkey has had frequent problems in extending the mandate 
since the Motherland Party (ANAP) was ousted from power in the 
October 1991 elections. 
  The then new Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel, who was 
critical of Turgut Ozal's Gulf War policy, first reacted 
adversely to the issue but was later persuaded into agreeing to 
an extension. 
  The former social democrat deputy prime minister, Erdal 
Inonu, as well as his predecessor, Murat Karayalcin, were also 
convinced by highlevel state staff of the necessity of extending 
the mandate. 
  But the friction with the United States, the heavy losses 
which have occurred owing to the pipeline closure and the 
serious economic crisis Turkey is going through are now 
reportedly putting more pressure on politicians. The recent 
electoral victory of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP), which 
has been voting continuously against the extension, is cited as 
another pressure. 
  In his commentary titled "The secret formula which angered 
the U.S.A." mass circulation HURRIYET writer Sedat Ergin wrote 
Thursday that Turkey's final trump card would be the Provide 
Comfort Operation dubbed by the Turkish public as Poised Hammer. 
  Ergin also warned against the atmosphere in Turkey 
immediately after the RP victory which was one opposing this 
force. 
  In the words of one senior official, "Whatever we do and 
whatever Mrs. Ciller does, this time there is the serious risk 
that the DYP [True Path Party] group may not be persuaded." 
  Turkish officials believe that if the pipeline could be 
emptied this would lift some of the economic burden being 
shouldered by the people and would without doubt bring about the 
conditions necessary for the government to extend the mandate. 
In Ergin's words, "Turkey's bargaining chips are not as small 
as some people think."

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that all 
deposits in Turkish lira or foreign currencies in all banks have 
been placed under state guarantee as of today. No limitations 
are being imposed on the amount of the deposits. 
  Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin, State 
Minister Aykon Dogan, Industry and Commerce Minister Tahir Kose, 
and Central Bank Governor Yaman Toruner, as well as other 
officials, held a joint news conference in Ankara today. 
  [Begin recording] [Ciller] We have come here today to 
announce a decision we consider extremely important for our 
country. All savings accounts and deposits in all the banks in 
our country have been placed under state guarantee from now on. 
From now on, all the savings accounts and all the money 
deposited by the people in all the banks in the country, 
regardless of their size, are under state guarantee. Half of 
the total deposits, which amount to some 536 trillion lira -- of 
this amount, 255 trillion is in Turkish lira and the remainder 
in foreign currency -- had been insured and guaranteed. In 
other words, close to 270 trillion lira was under guarantee. 
From now on, all deposits, whether they are in Turkish lira or 
foreign currencies, are under state guarantee. 
  An important stability package is being implemented in our 
country. Step-by-step, it will become clear in the coming days 
that this package will gradually yield positive results. I 
would like to again remind our people that there were some 
suspicions and hesitations in the first months of the struggle 
we launched against terror. We have surmounted them all. This 
package, which we will implement with the same determination and 
resolution, will also prove to be auspicious for our country. 
  Our television and press have been issuing different reports 
on the issue. Our newspapers have been carrying at least two 
cover stories daily concerning the difficulties being faced by 
various banks. This atmosphere of uncertainty has put our 
banking community in an almost suspicious position. Given this 
atmosphere, the state has increased the insurance premium from 
0.6 percent to 1 percent, thus placing all deposits under state 
guarantee. I would like to clearly state that our people can, 
without any hesitation, deposit any currency any time in any 
bank. All deposits are under state guarantee. 
  Our country is based on a free market economy. All the rules 
of a market economy are fully functioning. When we look at the 
geographic region, we can observe economic difficulties. This 
is actually the case throughout the world. These economic 
difficulties can be observed in the United States, Europe, and 
Japan. In our region, however, Turkey is the only free country 
where a market economy is functioning. We have an economy that 
is freer and more secure and in which the market mechanism 
functions much better than all the Eastern European countries, 
all the former Soviet republics, and some of the Western 
countries. Let this be known to all. 
  Let everyone deposit his money in any bank of his choice 
without fear. No one will question the citizen about the 
origins of his deposit. Let the citizens deposit their money 
without concern and be aware that their money is guaranteed by 
the state. 
  The economic stability package we have been implementing is 
following the planned course. There is no deviation from our 
estimates. The projections made by the State Planning 
Organization are on target, and we believe this trend will 
continue. Therefore, I would like to reiterate that everything 
is under control. Our struggle will benefit the entire country. 
We will begin feeling its positive effects in the coming year 
and in the coming months. We are facing difficulties which we 
will surmount in a spirit of unity and solidarity, and we will 
continue on our path by distributing the burden of these 
difficulties in a just manner. This is the right thing. We 
will continue to distribute this burden fairly. 
  I would like to stress once again: Our banks and 
particularly all the deposits in the banks have been placed 
under state guarantee with the aim of benefiting our people. I 
thank you all. The Central Bank would like to issue a statement 
now. 
  [Toruner] Under the new arrangement, all Turkish lira and 
foreign currency savings accounts, of which only 150 million 
lira [as heard] were insured to date, are now entirely covered 
under the savings fund without any limitations. Although we 
have sufficient resources, in cases where the fund fails to meet 
all the requirements, the necessary funds will be provided by 
the Central Bank of Turkey in accordance with Article 66 of the 
Law on Banks. Therefore, there is no problem of resources. All 
Turkish lira and foreign currency accounts have now been placed 
under state guarantee. Consequently, our citizens, whose 
Turkish lira and foreign currency savings in the banks are 
guaranteed by the state, can securely deposit their savings in 
any bank operating in Turkey. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Does this include the banks 
that have been closed down? 
  [Ciller] This decree covers all future transactions. 
Naturally, we are approaching past transactions with compassion, 
and investigations are continuing. This is a decision adopted 
today and encompasses developments and changes to occur as of 
today. We are guaranteeing the following: All foreign currency 
accounts and all other deposits are guaranteed by the state as 
of today. There are creditors from previous transactions with 
other banks. The investigation and the breakdown of all assets 
with regard to the reimbursement of these creditors is 
continuing in a very serious manner. Beginning today, we are 
guaranteeing all Turkish lira and foreign currency accounts in 
all banks, small or large. Everything is under government 
guarantee. Let our people relax and deposit their money in any 
bank they choose. Let them know that they are guaranteed by the 
state. [end recording]

  [Text] Ankara--One of Turkey's top seven banks is said to 
be facing a serious financial crisis and may collapse soon, 
banking sources have claimed. 
  The bank, owned by a leading industrial group, has been 
suffering from a shortage of foreign currency funds and failed 
to meet foreign currency obligations to hundreds of customers 
recently. 
  It cannot repay foreign exchange accounts to depositors, who 
wish to close such accounts or withdraw a major portion of their 
savings, sources said. 
  One senior banker said a group of leading banks were warned 
by the "authorities" that this bank was in serious crisis and 
that the group should act accordingly. 
  "Like a few others, we received an official letter of 
warning 
noting that...bank had for some time failed to meet foreign 
exchange obligations to its customers because of a shortage of 
foreign funds," explained the same source, who asked not to be 
named. 
  He mentioned reports that most of the foreign exchange 
depositors have been given repayment dates in the future. 
  "This might be a temporary liquidity problem. Yet the letter 
signals that things might actually be much worse," he said. 
Meanwhile, the Treasury declared that it had no fault in "not 
warning" the relevant parties on time before the collapse of 
three banks; TYT [Foreign Trade] Bank, Marbank and Impexbank. 
  It said in a written statement that the officials had 
carried 
out the necessary (financial) supervision and ruled out any 
delays and negligence with cases of three collapsed banks. The 
Treasury had come under fire for not warning (at least) the 
government banks about the worsening financial structures of the 
three banks and thus causing substantial public losses--at 
around $80 million. 
  In a related development, Yalim Erez, chairman of the 
Turkish 
Union of Chambers and Bourses (TOBB) said on Friday [29 April] 
that the banks should either "do decent banking" or become 
extinct.

  [Excerpt] President Suleyman Demirel this morning received 
Republican People's Party leader Deniz Baykal. In a statement 
after the hour long meeting, Baykal said that the country is 
facing a great economic crisis. He noted that all the problems 
are tied to the government problem, adding that it has become 
evident that the current government is incapable of solving the 
current issues. Baykal said that the government issue should be 
discussed at the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] and 
solved. 
  [Begin Baykal recording] This issue should not be a constant 
source of discussion and complaints in unauthorized forums and 
by unauthorized organs. The time has come to discuss and assess 
this issue at the authorized organ, which is the TGNA, within 
the framework of the appropriate rules and regulations. 
Everyone should shoulder his responsibilities and execute his 
duties. [end recording] 
  Baykal stated that the primary condition for solving the 
country's problems is to form a determined government that will 
inspire confidence and secure the support of the people. 
  Demirel received Nationalist Action Party leader Alpaslan 
Turkes in the afternoon. At the meeting, Turkes told Demirel: 
Your messages are most beneficial. You raise the morale of the 
people. In reply Demirel said: 
  [Begin Demirel recording] We are waging a psychological war. 
If, as a nation and as a people, we believe that we can surmount 
the problems then that is what will happen. We have surmounted 
all our problems in the past. [end recording] 
  Demirel said that there is no reason for the Turkish economy 
to go bankrupt and added: There was a monetary crisis. 
Naturally, this problem should be solved without it affecting 
the economy and social issues. 
  In a statement after the meeting which lasted for 40 
minutes, 
Turkes said that he conveyed to Demirel his views on the 
country's political problems. Pointing out that the country's 
problems should be solved in accordance with human rights, the 
laws and the principles of democracy, Turkes added that views 
and rumored solutions outside this framework are invalid. He 
noted that the government and statesmen should keep up their 
responsible attitude regarding national unity and the country's 
territorial integrity. 
  [Begin Turkes recording] I told him that statements are 
being made from time to time to the effect that the activities 
of our security forces against the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] should be stopped and that a political solution 
should be sought. I also told him that these statements should 
not be heeded. I said that these statements are aimed at 
deceiving the Turkish people. I said that those who want to 
divide Turkey are resorting to such deceit. [end recording]

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has received the leaders 
of the opposition parties separately at the Cankaya Mansion and 
discussed internal and foreign developments. Within the 
framework of his meetings, Demirel met yesterday with Democratic 
Left Party leader Bulent Ecevit and today with ANAP [Motherland 
Party] leader Mesut Yilmaz and Prosperity Party [PP] leader 
Necmettin Erbakan. 
  In a news conference after the hour-long meeting with 
Demirel, Yilmaz said that he primarily explained to the 
president his evaluations and proposals on economic issues. 
Yilmaz pointed out that he stressed to Demirel that no 
concessions should be made on the free market economy while 
overcoming the economic crisis. Yilmaz said that the stability 
program cannot succeed without a monetary program, a foreign 
exchange policy, and free foreign currency reserves. 
  [Begin Yilmaz recording] These shortcomings have not been 
eliminated yet. On 5 April, the honorable prime minister 
promised that she would announce the monetary program in 15 
days. A month has passed, and there still is no monetary 
program. It is impossible to trust such a government or its 
stability program. It is impossible to achieve stability or 
succeed in the program without trust. In brief, under the 
administration of Ciller and her team, Turkey has been in a 
vicious circle for a month now. I conveyed these concerns to 
the president, and he told me that he will communicate these 
warnings to those concerned. [end recording] 
  ANAP leader Yilmaz further stated that the annual increase 
in 
the wholesale and consumer prices is the highest in Turkey's 
history. Pointing out that wholesale prices increased by 32.8 
percent in April, Yilmaz said that the increase in the salaries 
of civil servants for the coming six months is less than 30 
percent. Pointing out that the inflation rate since January is 
double the increase in civil servants' salaries, Yilmaz added: 
This is what the government deems fit for its civil servants, 
those it had promised would not be crushed by inflation. 
  In answer to questions, Yilmaz said that he did not repeat 
his views on the new government to the president; however, he 
added, he conveyed to the president his doubts about the present 
government's trustworthiness and said that the worsening 
situation can be prevented by removing this government. Yilmaz 
said that Demirel noted the importance of solving this issue in 
the Assembly and within the framework of the Constitution. 
  In answer to another question, Yilmaz said that Demirel 
accords great importance to the democratization efforts and to 
the amendments envisaged in the Constitution and laws and 
expressed his wish that ANAP, as the main opposition party, will 
also contribute constructively to these efforts. Stating that 
he explained to Demirel that for him, the economy is the main 
issue and that ANAP is opposed to the authorization and tax laws 
under discussion in the Assembly, Yilmaz said that ANAP is ready 
to cooperate in the democratization process as it has in the 
past. 
  Demirel later received PP leader Necmettin Erbakan. In a 
news conference after his hour-long meeting with Demirel, 
Erbakan said he had an extremely favorable meeting with the 
president in which the country's urgent issues, as well as the 
general situation, were discussed. Claiming that the country is 
being governed with "Take a loan and eat" logic, Erbakan said 
Turkey should return to the principle of "Produce and prosper" 
without any loss of time. Pointing out that a trustworthy 
infrastructure together with a clever mobilization for 
production are necessary to achieve this principle, Erbakan said 
that for this, Turkey needs a government that is driven. 
Erbakan said Turkey is basically a rich country and added that 
it has all the elements necessary -- a young and hard-working 
population -- to overcome the issues. Erbakan said that the 
solutions to these issues will be achieved legally and added 
that parliament itself will put forward the solution. 
  Stating that the people exhibited their common sense on 27 
March by indicating where they thought the solution lies, 
Erbakan stated that early elections will solve the problems. 
Erbakan indicated that there is a possibility of forming a new 
government in the event that early elections are not held. 
Erbakan said he hopes such a government will be formed, thereby 
freeing the country from its problems. 
  Erbakan said: In the event that a new government is not 
formed, we want to solve the issue by holding early elections. 
In any event, our principal condition is that the problems be 
solved within democratic laws and on legal grounds. We have 
faith that both our nation and parliament have the capability to 
solve this issue. In order to achieve these solutions, all the 
deputies must set aside their party politics, put the nation's 
interests first, and work together.

  [Text] Halit Dagli, True Path Party [TPP] deputy leader, 
has said that his party does not accept the right of any 
authority or group outside the assembly to speak on behalf of 
the nation and the people and that the nation is closed to any 
antidemocratic interim-regime formula. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Ankara, Dagli said that all 
the country's problems will be solved within the framework of 
the pluralistic democratic structure and the assembly. He noted 
that seeking new and artificial government formulas will be 
detrimental for the country and will be a waste of time. Noting 
that the coalition government is advancing with determination on 
the path of structuring Turkey as a contemporary and advanced 
country while approaching the 21st century, Dagli added that all 
the obligations cited in the coalition protocol are being 
fulfilled. He noted that the terror and economic problems were 
the result of erroneous policies implemented for years, adding 
that the government has the willpower to solve these problems. 
  In reply to a question, Dagli said that the Chief of Staff's 
Office should not be dragged into political polemics. He added: 
No one has the authority to wear out this institution. We do 
not welcome this. In reply to a question of the extension of 
the chief of staff's term in office, Dagli said that Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller is satisfied with his performance and that 
all the commanders of the Turkish Armed Forces have contributed 
greatly to the solution of the problem of terror.

  [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has declared that 
an investigation has been launched in connection with the 
incidents that erupted following the May Day demonstrations in 
Ankara. He added that necessary action will be taken against 
those who were responsible, in line with the outcome of the 
investigation. 
  Mentese replied to an off-the-agenda speech by Celal 
Kurkoglu, Social Democratic Populist Party deputy from Adiyaman, 
at the Turkish Grand National Assembly, which convened under the 
chairmanship of Vefa Tanir today. In his statement, Mentese 
remarked that the Ankara security director has been removed from 
office pending the conclusion of the investigation and the other 
persons involved in the incident have also been identified. 
  Mentese pointed out that although Turk-Is [Turkish 
Confederation of Labor], DISK [Confederation of Revolutionary 
Worker Unions], and Hak-Is [Turkish Moral Rights Workers Union] 
acquired a permit for the demonstration, many illegal 
organizations also participated in the demonstrations in Ankara. 
Members of these organizations, Mentese noted, shouted 
separatist slogans and carried placards with similar contents. 
  [Begin Mentese recording] As far as we could determine, 
legal unions belonging to Turk-Is, DISK, and Hak-Is, as well as 
illegal unions, and the civil servants platform attended the 
demonstrations. Also attending were members of the Turkish 
Communist Party [TCP] Marxist-Leninist [ML] organization under 
the placard of the "Banner of labor"; members of the TCP Spark 
[Kivilcim] Dev-Genc [Revolutionary Youth] Resistance [Direnis] 
under the placard of the DIRENIS magazine; members of the 
Turkish Northern Kurdistan Liberation Organization [Turkiye 
Kuzey Kurdistan Kurtulus Orgutu] under the placard of the 
"United socialist alternative, young hope, young liberation"; 
and members of the Dev-Yol [Revolutionary Path] organization 
under the placards of "Revolutionary youth, the right to speak, 
authority, power to the people," and "Struggle until the 
liberation of Huseyin Mahil Ulas." These are illegal 
organizations. 
  I continue: Members of the Dev-Sol [Revolutionary Left] 
organization marched under the banners of "Dev-Genc 
[Revolutionary Youth] free [word indistinct] struggle"; members 
of the Turkish Revolutionary Communist Party under the banner of 
"Work, bread, freedom"; members of the Turkish Revolutionary 
Communists Union [Turkiye Ihtilalci Komunistler Birligi] under 
the banner of "Sweat of the brow"; members of the TCP-ML-TMLGP 
[expansion unknown] under the banner of "New democratic youth, 
partisan youth"; members of Direnis Movement under the banner of 
ODAK [FOCUS] magazine; members of the Militants for Anarchy and 
Terrorism under the banner of "Anarchist"; members of the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] under the banner of "Long live the 
brotherhood of peoples"; and members of the Rizgari organization 
marched under the banner of "Rizgari." [end recording] 
  Mentese declared that despite this, the demonstration was 
followed with patience to prevent any incidents. When the 
crowds were about to disperse, however, a group of about 200 
people belonging to illegal organizations refused to disperse 
despite all warnings and insisted on marching towards Kizilay, 
Mentese reported. He explained that the members of the group 
stoned the security forces, who in turn, prevented them from 
entering the prohibited zone. Mentese expressed regret and 
condemned the action against Ankara Deputy Salman Kaya, who was 
present at the scene of the incident. Mentese said that those 
who stoned the security forces, who were fulfilling their duty, 
should also be condemned in the same way.

<F P=106> [Third of an unspecified number of installments of an </F>
"abridged" interview with Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Workers 
Party of Kurdistan, PKK, by correspondents Ertugrul Kurkcu, 
Ragip Duran, and Behcet Avsar in Barr Ilyas in Lebanon on 21 
March] 
  [Text] [OZGUR GUNDEM] According to a demographic 
prediction, the Kurds will form the majority of the population 
in Turkey within 30 years. What will relations among the Kurds, 
Turks, and other people be in the long term? 
  [Ocalan] I liken the situation to the Byzantine period. Just 
the way Turkification started and developed soon after the 
Turks' penetrated Anatolia, a Kurdish invasion has now started 
from the East. The Kurds' inventiveness and poverty might 
exhaust the west of the country, that is, they might become a 
majority in the west. This won't be a good solution. 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] Considering that we might become the majority 
in the country, what is the situation regarding the expression 
of the identity, language, and culture by other non-Kurdish 
peoples? Are you thinking of guaranteeing these rights to them? 
  [Ocalan] We are aware of this situation. Specifically, there 
are influential cultures: the Assyrian and Syriac. There are 
also the Armenians. 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] There are Zazas, are there not? 
  [Ocalan] The Zaza culture is the oldest Kurdish culture. I 
do not consider it something separate from the Kurds. The other 
cultures must be regarded as different species. We can go as 
far as to grant them political autonomy. Let them freely 
express their own identity and culture. A democratic culture 
must be created in Turkey. It might make sense to be 
authoritarian in politics but strangulation of a culture is 
meaningless! You can only wish that even the smallest 
communities, such as the Turkmens, Lazes and Circassians, could 
also open up like flowers. Some synthesis of these cultures 
could be developed. There is a need to be open to various 
formations, ranging from a federation to confederation. It is 
vital that the multiplicity of opinions and cultures should not 
be destroyed with the argument that "we are being divided." 
Turkey's destruction of culture caused the peoples enormous 
spiritual and linguistic poverty. It is time to halt this 
trend! Yes, we understand the aims behind the political 
centralization but what should we make of this strangulation of 
cultures? This is the extremist form of Kemalism. I firmly 
believe this is not enriching Turkey. There is a mentality that 
favors forging national unity by force. Let us say that 
Turkey's population is 40 million. But they are bragging by 
saying: "We are 60 million." Suppose you are 200 million or 
even 1 billion. What is the purpose behind this? They might be 
thinking of swallowing the entire world. Let us suppose that 
you swallowed the world. By the way, Hitler too was thinking 
along these lines. Let us suppose that you Turkified the entire 
world. This would mean the end, the desertification of the 
world. But the existence of many cultures and languages is 
life's blessing. Is it not? Be content with a 40-million 
population and beautify its language, culture, economy, and 
spiritual life so as to lead to a better life. Then your 
neighbors and cultures within your common borders will be a 
source of pleasure and enrichment. I think that people nowadays 
are music fans. Let them also listen to Kurdish music. Allow 
every other culture freedom. Besides, you are acting with 
duplicity when it comes to exploiting cultures. You should 
appear before the world with your own identity to help forge 
better human relations. 
  I liken the situation of Kurds to that of a woman who gets 
bedded and nothing more. She is always told: "Let us live 
together." But she is not allowed to speak and is asked to 
"Look at me with rapture and say how great I am." Meanwhile, you 
have severed her tongue and gouged out her eyes. This is a 
tragedy. So any move toward a solution would entail a broad 
democratization and decentralization. The centralization will 
be to a degree that the peoples want. We will not accept 
centralization simply because some army generals and bureaucrats 
want it for their own interests. For me the so-called national 
unity of Turkey is not to the benefit of the Turkish people. It 
reflects the interests of some army generals, bureaucrats, and a 
political elite. It does not reflect the interest of the 
Turkish people. The soldiers are nervous. Why? Because the 
position of the army generals is under threat. If they lose the 
war [against the PKK] the army generals will lose their 
privileges. They are waging a war for their own positions; they 
are not waging the war of the Turkish people. These things 
should be known well. 
  I believe in the democratic alternative. A Turkey sunk 
deeply in Kurdistan is an asphyxiated Turkey. A Turkey bent on 
annihilating the Kurds is a Turkey chased out of Anatolia. This 
is not the path of reason. In old times the Turkish 
revolutionaries wanted to get rid of such leaders. I think this 
possibility should be considered. We must raise the issue of how 
much longer these people who commit crimes against the peoples 
can stay on the land. They will go but peoples will remain and 
develop their own democratic alternatives. 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] You are talking like Turkey's 
revolutionaries. 
  [Ocalan] In this regard we are not working merely as Kurdish 
revolutionaries. Our function rests in being Turkey's 
revolutionaries. It might sound paradoxical but, as in times 
past, when it was stated that "any political party in Turkey is 
also a Kurdish party," now we are saying: "A Kurdish party is 
also a party of Turkey." I was told that Mahir Kaynak [a 
Turkish leftist] was amazed that "there is no enmity against 
Turks within the PKK." Why should there be such enmity? It 
simply cannot be. Our enmity is against the oppression of the 
peoples. There are many Turkish boys and girls fighting with 
us. We live together every day. There is unbelievable, 
harmonious unity among them. They don't feel that "These are 
Kurds; we should be scared of them." We have no enmity or 
hostility against the Turks. Ours is a great fraternal and 
internationalist expression. There is no reason we should 
ignore this aspect of relations and harp on about what they did 
"to other Turks, Armenians, and Greeks or say they are the 
extension of various foreign forces." Those who say such things 
are the stooges of foreign forces. 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] While we are at it, there are reports that 
permanent missions of the PKK or ERNK [National Liberation Front 
of Kurdistan] will be opened in the Greek capital of Athens and 
the Russian capital of Moscow. What is the diplomatic 
importance of opening these missions in Russia and Greece, which 
are considered the traditional "enemies" of the Turks and with 
which you do not have traditional ties? 
  [Ocalan] The opening of our missions in these countries 
undoubtedly is linked with Turkey's traditional enmity against 
the Kurds and Greece. There might be historic reasons for these 
countries' interest in us but we are not thinking of 
"surrounding the Turks with enemies or retaliating by imposing a 
suffocating ring around her." Such thinking comes from Turkes 
[leader of the Nationalist Movement Party], who is frightening 
the public by claiming: "They [the Kurds] want to throw us out 
of Anatolia." It will be senseless for us to follow such a 
policy, knowing full well that eliminating Turks in such a 
conflict would also mean the elimination of the Kurds. The 
Kurds will not be eliminated in this manner. 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] What then? 
  [Ocalan] The Turks can no longer impose on us a policy that 
is against the interests of the Kurds and has reached the stage 
of destroying the identity of the Kurds. The Kurds can't be 
suppressed as in the past; this is obvious. Millions of Kurds 
-- here we should add all the Kurds in other sundered areas -- 
have reached a consensus on this. Some 40 million Turks will be 
confronted by 40 million Kurds. If we launch a century-long 
war, nothing will remain of the Turks. The way to forestall 
this is for the farsighted people who want to stave off the 
danger to take charge of the situation. But this cannot be done 
by attracting a few Kurdish collaborators to the government. 
This problem cannot be solved by saying: Let us suppress and 
destroy the Kurds and "then we can give them something." 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] Well, where does the solution rest then? 
  [Ocalan] In a free democratic atmosphere! There should be an 
opportunity for the free exchange of views and political choice 
by removing the shadow of coercion. What I really mean is using 
the right of engaging in secure politics. If you guarantee this 
security throughout Turkey, I will have no other demands 
concerning the Kurdish problem. I want to engage in politics in 
an atmosphere in which arms are silent. This is a reasonable 
right. If you give the guarantee, then I will go in among the 
Kurds and Turks and engage in politics. If there is a real 
desire to end this war, I am all for it, really. And I will 
propose no preconditions regarding the Kurds' demands. Let the 
use of force be removed. Yes, to engage in free politics... 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] I am pleased to hear this. I have an actor 
friend who knows nothing beyond the propaganda in the press. 
When I told him that "Apo [alias for Abdullah Ocalan] might be 
satisfied with entering the parliament as a deputy from 
Diyarbakir or might be satisfied only with forming his own 
party," he replied: "Is that all?" I just wanted to mention 
this. 
  [Ocalan] Of course. This will require some negotiation. 
What I am saying is: Let us smooth these problems over. The 
use of political rights depends on particular guarantees. If I 
go there today, they will detain me and hang me tomorrow. The 
DEP [Democracy Party] was ostensibly given the right to engage 
in politics but now its members are facing execution on charges 
of being "traitors to the country." But I would want to engage 
in secure politics. I will seek security in the Constitution 
and the law. Not satisfied with that, I will ask for particular 
institutional measures. Being a democrat, I believe in a 
Kurdish identity. I will address the people with this identity 
of mine. This should have a place in the law. Let us make the 
necessary changes. Why should you [the Turks] impose your own 
arrangements on me by unilaterally denying everything that 
defines me? Will anything remain of democracy if you act like 
that? In the context of democracy there should be Kurdish 
parties and social and political institutions. There are lots 
of local problems to be tackled. So there will be local 
administrations. There will be local parliaments. But there 
are also things to be tackled together with the Turks. We will 
carry out joint government and parliamentary work. Some do not 
want to understand this. Let them come to me. I will explain 
all this in one go. I did not attend the law faculty but I can 
show them how to do what. I am looking for a counterpart. Let 
anyone with confidence in himself come here so that we can 
rearrange all these things within the context of Turkey's unity 
and territorial integrity. 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] Who do you want? Who will we bring to you? 
  [Ocalan] Anyone. I am even ready for an ordinary civil 
servant. Let him come so that heeding the people's voice, we 
can stop this conflict and usher in freedom of thought and 
particular political choices away from the shadow of arms. No 
one is avoiding this. I am ready to open a debate about 
particular and very modest democratic demands. I am asking you: 
Do you have such a counterpart for me? 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] They do not respect me, otherwise I would 
have come to the talks. I do not know if those higher up would. 
But what clear-cut communal and political projects is the PKK 
offering for the meaningful, democratic, free, peaceful, and 
stable solution of this problem? 
  [Ocalan] We want to reorganize the historic Turkish-Kurdish 
relations. History shows these relations. They began under 
Sultan Selcuk and peaked under Sultan Yavuz. They also form the 
foundation of the Republic established by Mustafa Kemal. These 
relations must be admitted first. We want to surmount the blind 
policy of violence, which is against the interests of the 
Kurdish people and goes as far as to deny all its national 
democratic demands and identity and even annihilates it. The 
following are some of the fundamental principles needed to 
surmount the current policy: (1) The recognition of 
Kurdish-Turkish relations. (2) The suspension of the policy of 
violence against and the assimilation of the Kurds, that is, the 
erosion of the Kurdish identity. (3) I am saying that alongside 
the institutions suitable for each people's national identity, 
there is a need to make a transition to a system of federal 
parliament and government based on partnership institutions, 
that is, to put it more concretely, based on local, or perhaps 
federal, parliaments and governments. This is the most concrete 
path to a solution that we could advance: the revision of all 
relations and the recognition of the need for reorganization, 
not under the shadow of arms or pressure, but based on complete 
free will. If this is accepted, then there could be an easy 
movement toward reorganization within Turkey's existing borders 
and based on the genuine free will of the two peoples, which 
would forge a stronger fraternity than the current one. This is 
possible without too much fighting. I believe in this but I 
have no counterpart. 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] You spoke against the use of force, 
assimilation, and the threat of arms but primarily the General 
Staff and an important section of the public accuse you and your 
party of using violence and of committing savagery and 
massacres. So while you declare your opposition to violence, 
your party is being accused of practicing such things. Is there 
not a contradiction here? 
  [Ocalan] Before asking me that, you should have read this 
[not further specified; however, Ocalan appears to be referring 
to a paper in his hand]. Do I have to read it for you? We 
announced the names of those killed during the shelling of 
Gabar, Sirnak, and Soke. Their birthplaces were also given. 
Some 16 people were listed. We also obtained the names and 
dates of birth of the villagers killed in the village of Ziver 
in the district of Eruh during the shelling. The number killed 
here was 23. Over 50 villagers were killed in shelling on 
election day alone. Their names are known. I am not 
exaggerating their number. The press did not mention these 
facts. So who is committing the savagery? Don't they claim 
that children are being killed? Go and check their age. You 
should be realistic. When women and children get killed and it 
is beyond our control, when angry young people place bombs here 
and there, you cannot describe this as PKK tactics. We are 
trying to prevent such action. If we do not prevent such action 
the streets might turn into a hell. We are very attached to the 
principles of humanism and war conventions. It is the General 
Staff that is not doing what is needed on this issue. 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] When do you hope to see the realization of 
your ideal of the "recognition of the Kurds' political, 
cultural, and historic rights and of your return to Turkey to 
represent your people on a legal platform?" 
  [Ocalan] I have spent 15 long and important years of my life 
in the Middle East, which is a place of contradictions. I have 
not done this out of devotion to the place. I have put up with 
it out of very difficult but very fundamental historic, 
political, and humanistic considerations. It is my ideal to be 
engaged in politics amid my people, even in Turkey. I am not 
devoted to conducting a policy with the use of arms. I have no 
intention of putting my neck out like a sheep if I am given no 
alternative but execution. I will defend myself to the end with 
whatever means I can find in any corner of the world. It is 
obvious that the defense of my own person is linked with the 
defense of my own people and party. Why am I doing all these 
things? I am doing them so as to engage in politics. I have no 
desire for violence for the sake of it. We have political goals 
and national and democratic demands and I want to put them into 
practice. It is the Turkish regime that does not grasp this. 
Let this regime express a bit of goodwill to solve the 
problems. Let it assign a counterpart to talks with us. Here 
my presence is not a condition. Let those counterparts who 
could solve this problem come together. Let us both [PKK and 
Turkish Government] support them. What is needed is for both 
sides to display goodwill. I reiterate: I am ready to display 
my goodwill to the end. But at the same time I will never allow 
the suppression, certainly not the denial, of a people's 
national democratic demands. If need be I can use ruthless 
violence for this purpose or act like the most democratic 
politician to fulfill these same duties.

<F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, Strasbourg] </F>
  [Text] The Strasbourg Parliament tonight overwhelmingly 
approved the enlargement of the European Union [EU] to sighs of 
relief from leaders in the current 12 member states. 
  MEPs [Member of European Parliament] cleared the way to 
admit 
Austria, Norway, Finland and Sweden at the start of next year 
after months of threats to scupper the deal because of 
concessions given to Britain over voting rights. 
  Britain's 45 Labour and 31 Tory Euro-MPs helped make up a 
massive majority in favour of enlargement. It was the biggest 
exercise of power in the Parliament's 36-year history. 
  There were slightly different majorities in each of the four 
separate votes -- 374 for Austria and Norway, 377 for Finland 
and 380 for Sweden. In each case there were fewer than 24 votes 
against and about 60 abstentions. A minimum of 259 votes out of 
a possible 517 were needed to admit the four new members. 
  The outcome followed last minute claims from opposers that 
the Parliament had capitulated to EU governments without 
exacting sufficient guarantees of its future involvement in 
legislation. The size of the majority prompted rousing applause 
in the packed chamber. 
  Parliament President Egon Klepsch declared: "This is of 
historic importance. The general public has become aware that 
this European Parliament has great powers and uses them with a 
great sense of responsibility." 
  Earlier, the leader of Britain's Labour MEP's, Pauline 
Green, 
told the chamber that it was the most important vote in the 
history of the Parliament. 
  "Probably for the first time, but certainly not for the last 
time, EU governments are being forced to focus on the importance 
of Parliament's role," she said. 
  A British Government spokesman in Strasbourg said: "The size 
of the majority will hopefully send a positive signal to the 
four countries as they prepare for their referendums." 
  A narrow vote in favour or a rejection would have been 
seized 
on by Tory sceptics as more evidence that too much power has 
been transferred to Brussels and Strasbourg.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Delcroix Wants To Increase Army </F>
Budget"] 
  [Text] Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix believes that 
the military budget needs to be increased. Yesterday, the 
minister was answering questions from reporters during the 
"Joint Effort 1994" maneuver, a staff exercise in which a 
complete division is deployed to impose and enforce peace on 
behalf of the United Nations. 
  Minister Delcroix said "that a political consensus is 
emerging in favor of once again increasing funding for the Army 
in the following legislative session." He urges less rapid 
participation in UN operations, but said that such participation 
should be better prepared and equipped with more resources. 
  Under the leadership of Lieutenant General Francis 
Briquemont, the former UN commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
Army is holding a staff exercise through today in Leopoldsburg 
[Belgium]. In such exercises, no units are deployed on the 
ground but realistic procedures are followed. The goal of the 
exercise is peace enforcement, restoring peace through the 
potential deployment of all possible means.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Defense Minister Volker Ruehe in Bonn </F>
by Ulrich Wickert in Cologne on 4 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Wickert] After the United Nations banned the Serbs 
from the Sarajevo region, they sent their troops to Gorazde and 
caused great suffering there. When UN pressure became too 
strong in Gorazde, the Serbs shifted their troops again -- this 
time to the north of the country. Whereas the Serbs and Muslims 
are now concentrating their troops around Brcko, the United 
Nations is preparing the deployment of 12 unarmed military 
observers. Thus, nobody should be surprised if the Serbs play 
cat and mouse with the United Nations. We interviewed Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe on this issue in our studio in Bonn 
shortly before this program. Good evening, Mr. Ruehe. 
  [Ruehe] Good evening, Mr. Wickert. 
  [Wickert] Mr. Ruehe, is the credibility of NATO suffering if 
the Serbs withdraw their troops from one area -- from Gorazde, 
for example -- upon NATO pressure, but use them again in another 
place -- in Brcko, for example. 
  [Ruehe] You are quite right. First of all, the credibility 
of the United Nations, under whose auspices the whole operation 
is being carried out, is being damaged. Yet NATO is also 
affected. We have seen that after the ultimatum for Sarajevo, 
things calmed down there. The Serbs then shifted their military 
actions to Gorazde. A resolution has now been adopted that 
covers all six safety zones. However, there are signs that the 
Serbs might again circumvent the decision. Precautionary 
measures have to be adopted to deter them because the 
international community, the United Nations, and NATO cannot 
allow the Serbs to lead them up the garden path. 
  [Wickert] You discussed this issue in a five-hour meeting 
with the U.S. defense secretary on what could be done to improve 
deterrence. What was the result? 
  [Ruehe] Well, we discussed other topics, too. I also 
visited the State Department. There have also been statements 
in Paris. I believe that a solution must be found to prevent 
what happened in Gorazde from being repeated. 
  [Wickert] What solution do you consider conceivable? 
  [Ruehe] International measures might be adopted with the 
United Nations. The safety zones might be enlarged on the basis 
of the existing formula to ensure that additional military 
action does not develop in other areas. We finally need a 
cease-fire and a situation in which violence is reduced so that 
the peace process can be advanced. In spite of all the 
ultimatums, one must never forget that a lasting solution is 
only possible if a peace agreement is concluded. However, it 
must be just so that it is not doomed to lead to another war. 
  [Wickert] Why is the West not yet ready to accept Yeltsin's 
proposal for an international peace conference? 
  [Ruehe] This is one possibility. But it will only be 
successful if violence can be stopped in Bosnia. Nothing would 
be worse than a peace conference that would be reduced to 
absurdity by military actions on the part of the Serbs. Thus, 
both things belong together: The implementation of a cease-fire 
everywhere in Bosnia and preparations for diplomatic efforts. 
The Russian proposal is quite interesting in this respect. A 
peace conference would then lead to a political solution. Yet, 
I would like to stress once more that the approval of the 
Serbian side is required. If one forces a completely unjust 
solution on the Muslims, this would be the beginning of the next 
war. Monitoring the implementation of such a peace agreement 
would be terrible for the United Nations and for NATO. 
  [Wickert] The United States believes that lifting the arms 
embargo on Bosnia would be useful. You also support this 
measure. When will it be possible? 
  [Ruehe] Well, we have endorsed such a move for a long time. 
However, one must also bear in mind that the number of soldiers 
on the ground who have saved the lives of tens of thousands of 
people -- particularly British, French, Danish, and Dutch 
soldiers -- has increased. They might be endangered. We are 
facing a dilemma and a conflict here. What I told the Americans 
is that we supported them on this issue in the past, but that it 
is now important to avoid a unilateral U.S. decision -- by 
Congress or by the President. Future decisions should be 
adopted jointly by Europe and the United States so that the 
situation does not become even more complicated. 
  [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Ruehe. 
  [Ruehe] You are welcome.

<F P=106> ["ff" commentary: "Murderous Decision"] </F>
  [Text] The Federal Government continues to participate in 
the killing in Kurdistan. This was decided by Bonn by lifting 
the halt to arms deliveries to Turkey. Germany sends weapons to 
a state that systematically oppresses, drives away, and kills 
the Kurds. This signals to the government in Ankara that the 
destruction of the Kurdish people continues to be more or less 
tolerated. 
  For this reason the question whether Turkish soldiers in the 
southeast of the country fight with German armaments is 
important, but not of a central nature. Now it becomes obvious 
that Kinkel's order to examine evidence of the use of German 
weapons was only a show to calm down critics. One can only call 
it cynical how the Federal Government ignores statements by 
eyewitnesses, misinterprets films, and adopts the excuses of the 
Turkish Government in those instances where German armaments are 
clearly visible in photographs. 
  However, the end of the halt to arms deliveries would be a 
scandal even if Turkey were no longer to use any weapons from 
Germany against the Kurds. The more armaments are streaming 
into the country, the less the military needs to worry about its 
stocks, the more unscrupulously can Ankara wage its war in the 
southeast. In addition, the symbolic importance of the decision 
made by Bonn is even more murderous than the continued use of 
German weapons in practice: It confirms to the Turkish 
Government its knowledge that, for Germany, good relations with 
the geostrategically important NATO partner are more important 
than the Kurdish people's right to existence.

  [Text] Vicente Albero, minister of agriculture, fisheries, 
and food, has handed in his resignation to Felipe Gonzalez. The 
resignation is described as irrevocable. He is now explaining 
the reasons for this resignation at the Ministry; the reasons 
why he is voluntarily leaving his post are linked to the Ibercor 
affair. Over to our reporter Manuel de Ramon. Hello Manuel de 
Ramon, good evening. 
  [Ramon] Former Minister Vicente Albero has explained that he 
resigned because he had mortgage bonds deposited in the office 
of the former receiver of the Madrid stock market, Manuel De La 
Concha. He gave Manuel De La Concha orders saying that these 
bonds were not to be speculated with. He had obtained these 
mortgage bonds when he resigned as managing director of the 
Marie Claire hosiery company in 1982. He was managing director 
until 1982, and then he got a job as general director in the 
socialist administration. He was paid in mortgage bonds which 
he deposited in Manuel De La Concha's office. 
  Vicente Albero has repeated that he did not speculate while 
he was working as a politician and as a civil servant. He only 
worked at his job and he is not mixed up in any shady deals. 
This is all we can say just now.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Solveig Rodsgaard: "The Conservatives Out of </F>
the Shadows"] 
  [Text] It is creaking, but it is holding. Cooperation 
between the Liberals and the Conservatives has been shaken 
several times recently. Following a reconciliation meeting 
between the two parties' coordinating committee last Tuesday [15 
March], it was decided that the parties would continue to work 
toward creating a nonsocialist-liberal government after the 
coming Folketing elections. 
  Conservative leader Hans Engell was the cause of the latest 
furor in the nonsocialist camp. He opened the door to 
discussions on expanding the possibility of investing 
wage-earner funds in businesses. This elicited harsh criticism 
from the Liberals, from the Danish Employers Association, and 
from Danish Industry. On the other hand, as expected, Engell was 
warmly embraced verbally by Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, 
since the government is making a conscious effort to split 
Liberal-Conservative cooperation. 
  This kind of basic political truth is known all too well by 
the leaders of the Liberal and Conservative Parties and their 
main concern is to keep the two parties together as a possible 
alterative government. Consequently, the two parties issued a 
joint news release following the Tuesday meeting of their 
coordinating committee. The meeting, by the way, had already 
been arranged before Engell stole the nonsocialist scene last 
week. 
  Nothing was left to chance, however. Engell and Liberal 
leader Uffe Ellemann-Jensen clarified a number of issued over 
the telephone on Monday. They agreed to issue a joint statement 
to the press and it was polished up by Liberal Vice Chairman 
Anders Fogh Rasmussen the same day. After a friendly luncheon 
meeting of the coordinating committee at Engell's office on 
Tuesday, the news release was sent out. It stated that the two 
parties had begun to develop a joint election platform, 
containing general guidelines for economic policy. It was 
stressed that during the coming months the parties would strive 
to coordinate their political statements at regular meetings of 
the coordinating committee. 
  However, the political reality is such that a power struggle 
between the two parties has now clearly begun. The Conservatives 
are now emerging from the shadows of the Tamil affair, and they 
have recently become more and more irritated over the Liberals' 
posture as the leading opposition party and Ellemann-Jensen's 
style as a prime minister candidate. Moreover, Engell is now 
confident enough to act more firmly as the Conservative leader 
who must demonstrate that the Conservative Party is an 
independent party and not the Liberal Party's little brother. 
"Nonsocialist votes that work" was Poul Schluter's slogan in the 
1977 elections, and it is still valid. 
  During the past half year, Engell has talked to a number of 
business leaders and he has noted an increasing need for new 
ways of thinking in many areas. The question of ATP [Labor 
Market Supplementary Pension] and the Wage Earners Cost of 
Living Fund investments are one example. Thus, Engell spoke out 
in an interview with BERLINGSKE TIDENDE last Sunday, without 
first informing the Conservative Folketing group and, of course, 
without informing Liberal Party members. 
  Many Conservatives were pleased by Engell's manner of making 
the political agenda, at least for a time, for the Liberals and 
for the government. The political turmoil has strengthened 
Engell's position. 
  The Conservative leadership is simply shrugging off the 
Liberals' reaction to the proposal in the form of predictable 
objections to "fund socialism through the back door." In the 
view of the Conservatives, every time the Liberals have brought 
up controversial proposals they have assumed that the 
Conservatives would simply stand by silently. But now that the 
Conservatives have spoken, the Liberals are suddenly talking 
about a threat to Conservative-Liberal cooperation. 
  The Liberals feel that the Conservatives not only take 
positions on Liberal proposals, but that they clearly criticize 
Liberal policies. And it is this that is the threat to 
Conservative-Liberal cooperation. Among other things, the 
Liberal leadership is still bitter over the fact that the day 
before the Liberal Party's national meeting on the EU on 26 
February, Engell (in an interview with JYLLANDS-POSTEN) 
distanced himself from the Liberals' EU policy and warned 
against making EU policy a political battle ground in Denmark. 
  Liberal politicians warn that the two parties could end up 
as 
they did in the 1970's, when in every decisive situation the 
Social Democrats managed to play the Liberals and Conservatives 
off against each other so that, despite a nonsocialist Folketing 
majority most years, Denmark had a Social Democratic minority 
government. 
  Another concern is also clearly discernible in the Liberal 
Party. The party's leading politicians are afraid that, in 
reality, the Conservatives do not actually want the 
Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party majority after the Folketing 
elections, toward which the Liberals are working. This majority 
would make Ellemann-Jensen prime minister of a strong 
nonsocialist bloc that would work against the Social Democrats 
and the middle parties. This concern of the Liberals is not 
without basis in reality. The Conservatives want a 
Liberal-Conservative government, but they are not particularly 
interested in forming a bloc with the Progress Party as a 
supporting party in Folketing. The Conservatives would like to 
use a Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party majority as a 
battering ram for creating a nonsocialist government. But they 
would also like for a future nonsocialist government to work 
together with the middle parties. 
  This is why many Conservatives stress the idea of including 
the middle parties in a coalition, knowing full well that a 
nonsocialist government after the next elections is highly 
unlikely. Regardless of the election outcome, the three small 
parties in the present government cannot go from Rasmussen to 
Ellemann-Jensen in the fall of 1994. But perhaps in the 
following elections, possibly in 1996, they could turn from 
Rasmussen to Engell. 
  Engell's statements on the wage-earner funds have served as 
a 
catalyst in the escalating debate over the difference between 
the Liberals and the Conservatives. But EU policy is certainly 
the area in which the major difference between the Liberals and 
Conservatives will be seen. 
  The Liberals' proposal for a national referendum in the near 
future on Danish membership in the WEU [Western European Union], 
the party's official line in favor of eliminating all of 
Denmark's exception clauses as soon as possible, the Liberals' 
acceptance of less power for the smaller EU nations and, 
especially, the decision at the Liberal Party EU congress that 
the EU should have a two-chamber system in which the European 
Parliament would be one of the legislative chambers are all 
elements that the Conservatives oppose. The Conservatives do not 
want a confrontation over Denmark's EU policy. A more peaceful 
development that would guarantee a yes vote in a future 
referendum is more in line with the Conservatives' thinking. 
  EU policy is also an area that can make cooperation 
difficult 
for the Liberals, Conservatives, and Progress Party. It would be 
difficult to reconcile the EU position of the Liberals with that 
of the Progress Party. 
  Even though the Liberals and Conservatives are now drawing 
up 
a joint election platform, they will continue to act as 
independent parties, the party leaderships state. The Liberals 
released a tax plan the other day that the Conservatives knew 
nothing about. The Conservatives have remained silent on the 
plan, while the government is shooting it down. Next week the 
Conservatives will present a report on the political economy of 
education, taxation, and business policy. 
  And what about the candidate for prime minister? After the 
meeting on Tuesday, Ellemann-Jensen was asked if they had 
discussed who would become prime minister. "Yes, we did. One of 
us two," Ellemann-Jensen said, with a nod toward Hans Engell.

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said it is 
up to the UN Security Council to show determination--as it is 
showing on other international issues--or to let the Turkish 
intervention in Cyprus slander its image and international law. 
The spokesman made his statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation commenting on a letter from Turkish Cypriot leader 
Rauf Denktas to the UN secretary general. In his letter Denktas 
criticizes the UN envoys and says that he is ready to continue 
with the talks if the proposals included in the UN documents are 
changed. 
  The spokesman said: In his letter, Denktas is again trying 
to implement a policy of delaying. The Greek Cypriot side's 
actions and demarches will be made after the UN secretary 
general submits his report and the National Council confers. At 
the National Council, President Glavkos Kliridhis will explain 
his thoughts for discussion and decisionmaking.

  [Text] Referring to the historic Israeli-PLO Agreement, the 
Foreign Ministry, representing the European Union [EU], stressed 
that the EU warmly welcomes the signing of the agreement and 
particularly respects the two sides' decisiveness not to allow 
extremist elements to raise obstacles in front of peace. The EU 
is calling on all sides to play full and positive roles on the 
bilateral and multilateral levels of the peace agreement. 
  New Democracy hailed the agreement between Israel and the 
Palestinians, describing it as a historic and courageous step 
toward a permanent peace settlement in the region. 
  Political Spring expressed hope that the courageous message 
of peace will find imitators in every distressed corner of the 
world, especially Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  A Coalition of the Left and Progress statement notes that 
the 
dream of past decades is now becoming a reality and the lengthy 
struggles of the heroic Palestinian people are justified.

  [Text] Paris, May 4 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata on Wednesday [5 May] expressed Japan's strong 
desire to join permanent members of the UN Security Council 
[UNSC], saying the country is playing a role worthy of becoming 
a permanent member state. 
  "It is necessary to increase the number of the council's 
permanent members. Japan is playing a role fitting to a 
permanent member state in all fields including politics and the 
economy. If (Japan) becomes a permanent member, it will fulfill 
as many duties as it can," said Hata, newly elected as prime 
minister April 25. He made the remarks to French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur at a banquet hosted by Balladur. 
  On Japan's bid for the permanent membership, Hata went one 
step ahead from the stand of the government of Morihiro 
Hosokawa, his immediate predecessor, which said Japan would 
discharge as many obligations as it can under a restructured 
United Nations. Along with Japan, Germany is also expressing 
hopes of acquiring a permanent east on the Security Council, 
which currently numbers five nations -- Britain, China, France, 
Russia and the United States. A UN working group is discussing 
how to reform the world body and aims to submit an interim 
report to the general assembly's regular session beginning in 
the third week of September. 
  In the meeting with Balladur that lasted for about two 
hours, 
Hata asked Balladur to visit Japan and the French premier 
expressed his wish to travel to Japan. Hata also said Japan 
will dispatch personnel to a mission of the conference on 
security and cooperation in Europe to Macedonia, a republic of 
the war-ravaged former Yugoslavia. The Japanese premier also 
told Balladur that Japan will consider offering 20 million 
dollars in loans to Albania, bordering Macedonia. 
  Hata arrived in Paris shortly before noon Wednesday from 
Rome 
for talks with French leaders on bilateral and international 
relations and on the July 8-10 summit of the group of seven 
economic powers in Naples, Italy. He left Japan on Monday on a 
six-day journey to Europe for official visits to Italy, France, 
Germany and Belgium.

<F P=106> [Report by Philippe Reinhard: "French Cowardice"] </F>
  [Text] The Strasbourg Parliament has voted in favor of 
expanding the European Union [EU]. The EU, which is already 
finding it difficult to function with 12 members is welcoming 
four new members. It is doing so without having first amended 
its institutional mechanisms. The British concept of Europe has 
thus prevailed with German complicity. It must be said that 
this peaceful "anschluss" is electorally profitable for Helmut 
Kohl. But what have the French done? 
  A European Parliament at the end of its session -- half of 
the deputies who voted in favor of expansion will no longer have 
seats after the 12 June elections -- has therefore ratified this 
European Munich [treaty]. Europe is hastily turning itself into 
a European free trade association 37 years after the Treaty of 
Rome. The British, who have constantly worked for this cause, 
have reason to rejoice. 
  Only the French could prevent it from happening, for fairly 
petty internal political reasons. And yet, on 14 April, Valery 
Giscard d'Estaing [a member of the European Parliament] 
presented the problem as it should be presented. He very 
logically demanded that the reform of the EU's institutions 
should precede the approval of expansion. "The rejection of the 
institutional choice leads to the inevitable dilution of the 
EU," he said. Europe has failed to reform its institutions with 
12 members. It is difficult to see how it could do so with 16 
in the future. 
  The French bear a grave responsibility in this matter. The 
attitude of the European deputies from the RPR [Rally for the 
Republic] is somewhat understandable. Most of them are so 
hostile to European unity that anything which undermines it 
pleases them. In so doing they are forgetting de Gaulle, who 
rightly refused Britain's entry into the Common Market on 14 
January 1963, to prevent Europe -- for which he cherished real 
political ambitions (the Fouchet plan) -- from becoming a free 
trade area. But we cannot expect the general's heirs to have his 
grand vision. By accepting expansion, they have dealt a final 
blow to Maastricht. It does not much matter to them that in so 
doing they have killed Europe. God forgive them, they knew not 
what they did. 
  The attitude of the UDF [French Democratic Union] is 
infinitely more worthy of condemnation. For strictly domestic 
reasons, because it does not want confrontation at a time when 
it is drawing up its list with its RPR partners, Dominique 
Baudis laboriously explained yesterday why he nonetheless 
accepted a vote which will certainly paralyze European unity. 
The mayor of Toulouse hopes that in future the European thread 
can be taken up again through a Franco-German "initiative." The 
CDU [Christian Democratic Union] has always had powerful 
arguments with which to win over its younger French cousins. 
For domestic policy reasons, Kohl's Europe is no longer that of 
de Gaulle and Adenauer, but the old and dangerous "Mittel Europa 
[Central Europe]." It is upsetting that the French Right is 
also lending itself to the destruction of a great idea in this 
way.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Excerpt] Turkish Grand National Assembly Speaker 
Husamettin Cindoruk has said that the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] terrorist movement and not the Turkish-Kurdish 
dispute is the source of the incidents in south and southeast 
Anatolia. TRT correspondent Kudret Dogandemir reports from 
Paris: 
  [Begin Dogandemir recording] Cindoruk is continuing his 
contacts in Paris. Cindoruk devoted his day to the French 
National Assembly and the Senate with the aim of promoting 
relations between the parliaments of the two countries. 
  Cindoruk, in Paris on an official visit, held a breakfast 
meeting with National Assembly President Phillipe Seguin. 
During the meeting, Seguin stated that Turkey is a very 
powerful country in its region. In turn, Cindoruk stated that 
Turkey is conducting deliberate and persistent efforts to enter 
the European Union. 
  Cindoruk later signed the National Assembly guest book, and 
Seguin presented Cindoruk with a plaque. 
  Cindoruk later met with the head of the Socialist caucus, 
(Martin Malve), and answered questions on the PKK. Pointing out 
that the PKK is a terrorist organization, Cindoruk recalled that 
Germany and France have banned PKK activities in their 
countries. Explaining that racism was never an issue in the 
transition from the Ottoman identity to the Turkish identity, 
Cindoruk stressed that everybody in Turkey has equal freedom and 
rights. 
  Cindoruk said that like France, which does not want Corsica 
to be divided or to break away, Turkey also does not want the 
unity of the state to be disrupted. Pointing out that the 
terrorists kill the old, the young, and the innocent 
indiscriminately, Cindoruk said: They both kill people and burn 
machines. They force the parties and newspapers in those 
regions to shut down. Cindoruk added that unfortunately, certain 
countries support those who are working against Turkey and use 
the human rights issue as an excuse. 
  (Malve) said Turkey has taken important steps toward 
development. [passage omitted] [end recording]

democracy as well as that of Europe. Cindoruk, who is on an 
official visit in Paris, has concluded his meetings there. He

and Television correspondent Kudret Dogan Demir reports from 
Paris: 
  [Begin Demir recording] Cindoruk was received by Mitterrand 
at the Elysee Palace. He also met with various 
parliamentarians. [passage omitted] In the statements he made 
during his visit, Cindoruk said that there are no significant 
disagreements between Turkey and France, adding that bilateral 
economic and cultural relations are developing. [passage 
omitted] Noting that Turkey has a serious terrorist problem, 
Cindoruk described the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
organization as a Marxist-Leninist armed gang. Pointing out 
that the Armenians committed genocide during World War I, 
Cindoruk added: If the Ottomans had engaged in ethnic cleansing 
could the Armenians have lived in Turkey until 1915? He noted 
that Turkey wants to establish good relations with Armenia but 
that the Armenians should withdraw from the Azerbaijani 
territories they have occupied. Cindoruk also attended a 
session of the National Assembly [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Joseph Mace-Scaron: "The Sorcerer's Apprentice"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Last Saturday [29 April], 
Francois Mitterrand gathered his Elysee [office of the 
president] aides apparently to reprimand those who had clumsily 
suggested that the president favored the prospect of the Tapie 
list confronting the Rocard [Socialist Party first secretary] 
list [in the European elections]. It had to be made known that 
this was all just press gossip and that it was unseemly to try 
to link him to petty political operations. 
  What we heard, therefore, were contradicting presidential 
statements. On 14 July last year, the head of state was fulsome 
in his praise for Tapie, the former minister of urban affairs, 
officially launching his campaign for the European elections. 
Today, he scarcely admits to knowing him. So by what miracle 
was Jean-Francois Hory, president of the MRG [Left Radical 
Movement], received several times at the Elysee while Michel 
Rocard was still awaiting an audience? 
  Indeed, by trying to turn the anniversary of Pierre 
Beregovoy's death into an anti-Rocard and anti-PS [Socialist 
Party] operation, by inviting Bernard Tapie to that ceremony, 
the Elysee strategists went too far too quickly. Especially in 
view of the fact that those close to the deputy for les 
Bouches-du-Rhone [Tapie] did not hesitate to fully exploit this 
move to the maximum extent. 
  And this is the rub: Francois Mitterrand has found people 
who are even better gamblers than he is. He thought he could 
use Tapie, but it is Tapie who has used the Elysee. 
<H5>  Obliged To Be a Rocard Supporter </H5>
  This is a loss of control, a badly controlled political 
operation which has a high price for Francois Mitterrand: He is 
obliged to say nothing until 12 June when or, if he speaks, it 
will be to express solidarity with the PS and its first 
secretary. 
  By pushing Tapie, the president of the Republic wanted to 
reopen the game on the Left and give himself the means of 
influencing the choice of the Socialist candidate for the 
presidential election. His blunder strips him of any room to 
maneuver, and he is obliged to support Rocard. From this we can 
gauge the extent of his anger.

  [Excerpt] Nice -- The prime minister went to Nice yesterday 
to attend the opening ceremony of the 27th General Assembly of 
the Asian Development Bank. Edouard Balladur took advantage of 
the opportunity to forcefully reaffirm France's interest in that 
continent and the desire of our country and Europe to have a 
greater presence there. "The stakes are considerable," the 
prime minister explained, "in the political sphere, the European 
countries and their Asian partners have prime responsibility for 
the security and stability of these continents...and in the 
economic sphere, Europe is the world's leading trading partner 
and is one of the most prosperous markets." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Pierre Briancon: "Clinton Tries To Justify </F>
His Diplomatic Vacillation"] 
  [Text] The mystery of U.S. foreign policy under Clinton's 
leadership deepens each time the President makes an appearance 
to clear it up. In an attempt to respond to the criticisms and 
to explain his foreign policy on Tuesday [3 May] evening during 
a spectacular production by CNN broadcast "to 200 
countries"--according to the network--the U.S. President for 90 
minutes responded to the main criticisms leveled at him for 
months over his management of all the hot issues at the moment 
-- Bosnia, Haiti, Korea, and Somalia. 
  But at the end of this lengthy expose, the American and 
international public had no answers to the main questions raised 
by U.S. foreign policy since Clinton's election: Is he really a 
new kind of president trying a new style of diplomacy in a 
radically different world? Or do the very qualities which often 
help him in domestic policy, such as his desire to build a 
consensus at all costs and his caution, render him incapable in 
the field of foreign policy? 
  The very fact that Clinton decided to devote a lengthy 
evening to answering the questions of international journalists 
-- in CNN's studios and on a link-up with several tense areas 
throughout the world -- reflects his obsession with opinion 
polls, according to his critics. It is a kind of delayed 
reaction, and various stances adopted in recent days look more 
like a desire to repair a falling poll rating than a real desire 
to define a clear and, if possible, bold foreign policy. Only 
40 percent of Americans now think that Clinton is doing "a good 
job" in this sphere, and the President's political advisers 
thought that a kind of crisis point had been reached. 
  Americans like their presidents to be direct and decisive in 
foreign policy. Debate, public analysis of issues, and 
vacillation can be accepted as proper democratic procedures in 
the realm of domestic policy, but in the diplomatic sphere, the 
public tends to like a "leader" rather than a university 
professor well versed in the analysis of the pros and cons. On 
Tuesday evening, Clinton continued to be the university 
professor, while peppering his speech with remarks dictated by 
the opinion polls rather than by a personal vision. With regard 
to Haiti, he had already spoken out during the day, stating 
that, with regard to the military junta, it was "time they 
went." On CNN, he went so far as to say that the United States 
could not "afford to rule out the possibility of a military 
option" for restoring exiled President Aristide to his rightful 
place. 
  The same firm message was delivered recently with regard to 
North Korea. Clinton said on Tuesday that "nobody wants a 
confrontation" with that country, which has probably built a 
nuclear bomb, but he added that it was a "potentially dangerous 
situation." 
  Attacked by domestic critics who accuse him of having passed 
on the role of American "leadership" to collective and anonymous 
bodies such as NATO or the United Nations and of systematically 
trying to make decisions multilaterally which he ought to make 
alone, Clinton admitted that he had "underestimated the problem 
of building a coalition" of big international powers with regard 
to Bosnia. "That took longer and was more frustrating that I 
thought," he said. "But it is part of the reality of the 
post-Cold War world." Clinton stressed several times that the 
leaders of the world's major powers were facing situations for 
which there are "no easy solutions," in which they "do not know 
what will work." His diplomatic team, strongly criticized in 
the United States, "is working on new ground," he stressed, 
defending his aides. 
  Aside from the firmer language on some points, this 
televised 
desire to show all that he does not intend -- or no longer 
intends --to leave foreign policy to his aides, Clinton 
reiterated the two main guidelines which he has used to define 
his foreign policy since he came to office: First, the fact 
that "America cannot solve every problems and should not become 
the world's policeman," but that it "will not hesitate to act 
alone when (its) major interests are at stake," and, second, the 
fact that his long-term strategy is "to encourage the success of 
new democracies," a policy pursued under the name of "expansion" 
(of the circle of market democracies -- LIBERATION editor's 
note) by National Security Adviser Tony Lake. Following this 
professorial lecture, the irritated Americans and the bemused 
world are still awaiting a presidential foreign policy.

  [Text] Paris, May 4 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
on Wednesday [4 May] rejected any question of striking a deal 
for the release of 11 French aid workers detained by Serbs in 
Bosnia for allegedly smuggling arms to Moslem forces. 
  Juppe said there was "no question of engaging in bargaining 
of any kind" over the workers for the relief agency Premiere 
Urgence (First Emergency) and he demanded their "immediate and 
unconditional release." 
  The workers were imprisoned in a Serb barracks at Lukavica, 
a 
suburb of Sarajevo, on April 8 after their aid convoy was 
intercepted and Serb troops allegedly found weapons in one of 
the trucks. 
  The 11 were accused of trafficking arms to the Moslem-led 
Bosnian government army and on Monday, three were indicted for 
arms trafficking. 
  Premiere Urgence said Tuesday that the three were to appear 
before a Bosnian Serb tribunal on May 8 and could face the death 
penalty or up to 20 years imprisonment. 
  The organization said the weapons were planted on the truck 
by the Serbs themselves. 
  Juppe, speaking to the National Assembly, said he had had 
confirmed rumours of what he called a "pseudo-trial by Bosnian 
Serb forces who are completely out of control. If this is the 
case, we will not accept this parody of justice," he said. 
  The Bosnian Serbs first proposed swapping the aid workers 
for 
11 Serb doctors and nurses held in Sarajevo by the Moslems. 
  Juppe said he would be seeking the support of other Western 
leaders, and in particular of Russia via its Foreign Minister 
Andrei Kozyrev, with whom he discussed the case last week. 
  Juppe was due to meet the head of Premiere Urgence, Thierry 
Mauricet, later Wednesday. 
  Premiere Urgence, which has been active in Bosnia 
transporting food parcels to Sarajevo with the agreement of the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees, will send lawyers and 
observers from Amnesty International and the International 
Federation of Human Rights to the trial, in the Bosnian Serb 
capital of Pale.

  [Text] Paris, May 4 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata and French President Francois Mitterrand agreed 
Wednesday [4 May] that North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons 
program threatens the global move toward preventing the spread 
of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear powers. 
  The two leaders shared the understanding during a two-hour 
meeting at the French Presidential Palace, Japanese officials 
said. 
  The meeting took place after Hata arrived in Paris from Rome 
as part of his European tour, which will also take him to 
Germany and Belgium. 
  They said Hata told Mitterrand that the North Korean nuclear 
issue "is a serious problem that threatens the nuclear 
nonproliferation regime, as well as undermines the security of 
the Asia-Pacific region." 
  Hata also said, "we must counter the threat in solidarity, 
while keeping the channels for (diplomatic) dialogue open." 
  Mitterrand agreed with Hata's view, the Japanese officials 
said. 
  On China, Hata told Mitterrand, "it is important for China 
to 
provide greater transparency in its activities in the military 
field...and it is crucial for us to urge China to demonstrate a 
positive response in the field of human rights." 
  Hata also told Mitterrand, "Japan wants to step up its 
cooperation with France in various fields from now on" to build 
a new international order to secure global peace in addition to 
strengthening the capabilities of the United Nations, the 
officials said. 
  Mitterrand replied, "I agree with your view. The two nations 
can build up a stronger relationship of cooperation." 
  The French president expressed his interest in enhancing 
cooperation, particularly in extending economic assistance to 
such areas as Indochina and Africa. 
  Hata expressed gratitude for France's endorsement for 
Japan's 
bid to secure a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, of 
which France is one of the five permanent members. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe expressed his support 
for 
Japan's bid for permanent membership on the UN decision-making 
body during his visit to Tokyo in March. 
  Mitterrand, however, stopped short of addressing the issue, 
according to the Japanese officials. 
  The French leader expressed his nation's readiness to 
welcome 
Japanese Emperor Akihito and his wife Michiko, who are slated to 
visit France in October. 
  "We are looking forward to meeting the emperor and empress," 
the president was quoted as saying. 
  Hata replied, "the emperor is also looking forward to the 
visit." The royal couple is slated to visit France and Spain on 
a two-week trip that will begin in late September.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. PESC/94/44: "Communique of the Presidency </F>
on Behalf of the European Union on the Gaza-Jericho Agreement"] 
  [Text] The European Union warmly welcomes the agreement 
between Israel and the PLO on Gaza-Jericho signed in Cairo on 4 
May 1994. It pays tribute to the determination of both sides not 
to allow extremist elements to pose obstacles to peace; and 
notes with appreciation the role played by the co-sponsors, the 
host country and others in encouraging the continuation of 
bilateral contacts and negotiations. 
  It also calls for the full and early implementation of the 
declaration of principles, towards which the agreement on 
Gaza-Jericho is an important step. In the light of this 
agreement, the Union urges all parties to play a full and 
positive role in both the bilateral and multilateral tracks of 
the peace process. 
  The European Union has reaffirmed its continuing commitment 
to the peace process with its adoption of a joint action on 19 
April. This will mobilize the political, economic and financial 
resources of the Union in support of a just, lasting and 
comprehensive peace. outstanding among them is the fact that two 
members of the EU are already taking part in the temporary 
international presence in Hebron, the confirmation of the 
Union's willingness to participate, at the request of the 
parties concerned, in a temporary international presence and the 
observation and monitoring of elections.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/379: "Commission Publishes </F>
Annual Report on U.S. Trade Barriers"] 
  [Excerpt] The European Commission is issuing today its 
tenth report on U.S. barriers to trade and investment. The 
report is not only a useful guideline and reference for 
bilateral trade negotiations between the European Union and the 
United States but also summarizes the obstacles inhibiting the 
free flow of transatlantic trade and investment and the main 
trade barriers European business faces in a significant number 
of U.S. markets. The bulk of the European Union's trade with 
the United States is not affected by trade barriers. 
Furthermore, for the relatively small percentage of the trade 
that does face barriers there will be fewer in the future due to 
the wide scope of the Uruguay Round and public procurement 
agreements that were finally concluded in Marrakesh in April 
1994. 
  This year, the report also points out the areas where the 
United States has to implement the Uruguay Round agreements. 
The faithful and timely transposition of these agreements into 
U.S. national legislation is of major importance to ensure that 
the benefits of the Round are capitalized on as soon as 
possible. It is important that the United States and the 
European Union demonstrate leadership in implementing the 
Uruguay Round results which will boost world trade and economic 
growth, create jobs as well as lowering transatlantic trade 
friction. 
  The publication of the tenth report follows the United 
States' publication of its annual national trade estimate report 
on foreign trade barriers. The Commission services report, 
however, is not a direct response to the U.S. report. The two 
reports differ in one major respect: Under U.S. trade law, the 
U.S. report could lead the United States to impose unilateral 
trade sanctions due to President Clinton's executive order on 
identification of trade expansion priorities of March 1994, 
which reintroduced a super 301 procedure. The Commission 
services report, however, does not serve such ends. The European 
Union is committed to full compliance with the multilateral GATT 
rules and those of the new World Trade Organization (WTO). It 
urges the United States to do likewise. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  The Key U.S. Impediments to Trade and Investment </H5>
  The European Commission services report identifies major 
horizontal and sectoral areas where access to U.S. markets is 
potentially threatened or excluded. These 
are: 

  -  Unilateralism in U.S. trade legislation: The U.S. has 
recently undertaken to renew the super 301 legislation by way of 
a presidential executive order. No other major trading partner 
of the EU has similar trade legislation. Such moves point to a 
renewed impetus in the U.S. towards increased use of unilateral 
or bilateral trade measures, and are a cause of great concern to 
the EU. They are largely inconsistent and incompatible with the 
multilateral trade system -- the backbone of post-war global 
economic growth. 
  -  The extraterritorial application of national 
trade provisions: These measures can adversely effect trade and 
investment by clashing with the sovereignty of America's trading 
partners and thereby lead to insoluble legal conflicts which 
create uncertainty and deter investment. Examples include the 
Cuban Democracy Act, reexport controls and the marine mammal 
protection act. 
  -  The extensive use of national security 
considerations: The United States continues to put forward 
national security considerations to justify curbs on trade and 
investment in pursuit of certain protectionist objectives. 
Measures range from limits on market share to procurement 
restrictions, such as those contained in the Berry Amendment 
Legislation, and from unilateral export controls to the 
screening and possible prohibition of foreign direct investment, 
for example through the Exon-Florio amendment. A restrictive 
1934 act limits foreign investment in radio communications to 20 
percent of the capital stock of any corporation in this area of 
business. 
  -  Public procurement and "buy America" legislation: 
There has been extensive discrimination, and even total 
exclusion, of non-U.S. controlled companies for certain public 
contracts tendered at federal and state level. A recent joint 
study by the EU and the United States pointed out the extent of 
these measures covering areas such as ports, airports and mass 
transit schemes. However, the recent EU-U.S. bilateral 
government procurement agreement signed in Marrakesh has helped 
to open up substantial parts of the U.S. procurement 
market. 
  -  High tariffs, fees, and excessive invoicing 
requirements: The Uruguay Round will greatly improve access to 
each other's markets. However the United States textiles, 
clothing, footwear, tableware, and glassware tariffs are still 
excessive with tariff rates as high as 40 percent for some 
items, higher than many developing countries apply. Tariffs 
applied for two-door multipurpose vehicles, presently considered 
by the U.S. as trucks, are burdened with a 25 percent tariff on 
imports (instead of the 2.5 percent tariff applied to cars), 
this despite a May 1993 ruling by the U.S. Court of 
International Trade to the contrary. 
  -  Tax legislation such as 
state unitary taxation, car taxes (luxury tax, gas guzzler tax, 
cafe) which are the subject of a GATT panel request by the EU. 
The discriminatory luxury tax for example has meant the 
European manufacturers have incurred almost 80 percent of the 
tax revenue, while only having a 3 percent market share. Beer 
and wine excise taxes are also unsatisfactory. 
  -  The multiplicity 
of standards at federal, state and municipal level, as well as 
protectionist labelling requirements hinder trading 
opportunities: Multiple standards and standard-making 
procedures in the United States, some of which are in breach of 
international norms, and the resulting fragmentation of the U.S. 
market add up to indirect barriers to trade. The EU and the 
United States are engaged in consultations in order to reduce 
such impediments. 
  -  The protection of intellectual property: This 
has caused conflicts, notably the continuing discrimination 
against non-U.S. products through section 337 of the tariff act 
of 1930, despite a GATT ruling to the contrary. The agreement 
on trade related aspects of intellectual property has resolved 
some of the issues provided it is faithfully transposed into us 
legislation. 
  -  The conditioning of the granting of national 
treatment to non-U.S. controlled economic operators in the 
United States: Companies with non-U.S. parents are often 
treated differently to those with U.S. parents regarding 
antitrust exposure of production joint ventures, or the 
participation in federally funded R&amp;D. This discrimination is 
brought about through reciprocity conditions and economic 
performance requirements, and could make EU investment notably 
less attractive in the United States. There are no less than 11 
bills pending in the Congress with these conditional national 
treatment provisions. In the same spirit the EU is concerned 
about impediments to foreign service providers to obtain 
effective access to the services markets in the United States as 
well as pressures to discriminate against foreign 
banks. 
  -  Antidumping and countervailing duties: the EU had to 
request a GATT panel last year after finding that the United 
States did not respect reasonable countervailing and antidumping 
procedures and methodology regarding a major part of the EU's 
steel exports. In a more recent case, provisional dumping 
duties of over 300 percent have been levied on a European based 
subsidiary of a Japanese company. The implementation of the 
Uruguay Round AD/CVD agreements are being carefully monitored by 
the European Commission. 
  -  Agriculture, fisheries, services, 
telecommunications and broadcasting: In all these sectors, the 
EU recognises that the Uruguay Round will bring relief to 
historical trade tension that has prevailed and affected 
transatlantic trade relations. Nevertheless considerable 
obstacles will have to be overcome to provide European industry 
with meaningful and sustained market access. 
  -  The maritime and 
aviation sectors: The EU remains very concerned at the use of 
direct and indirect protection provided to the United States 
shipbuilding industry (via the Jones Act). It is also worth 
recalling the persistently high level of indirect subsidies 
funnelled into the United States aircraft industries through 
various federally funded programmes. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  Domestic concerns about the competitivity of U.S. industry 
continue to exercise considerable influence on the formulation 
of U.S. trade policy both within Congress and the U.S. 
Government. The revitalisation of the "super 301" procedures 
through presidential executive order, proposals to install 
"green" and "blue" 301 provisions to cover environmental and 
social concerns, the unreasonable application of anti-dumping 
and countervailing duty measures against exports from the EU, 
and the growing proliferation of conditional national treatment 
provisions either still pending in Congress or already enacted 
are indicators of a residual undercurrent of protectionism and 
unilateralism that still exist in the United States. All these 
measures are anathema to an open world trading system which 
should be based on one set of negotiated multilateral rules and 
procedures fairly applied to all contracting parties in the GATT. 
  The signing of the Uruguay Round has removed a significant 
number of trade irritants between the European Union and the 
United States. Given the broad balance in EU/U.S. trade flows, 
there is now a major opportunity to cooperate and work together 
on the new trade issues of tomorrow. Furthermore EU and U.S. 
leadership will be essential to continue to remove global trade 
barriers thereby opening up new opportunities for all trading 
nations.

Brittan Holds Talks in Moscow"] 
  [Text] Sir Leon Brittan returned to Brussels after talks on 
Monday [2 May] in Moscow with Mr. Shokhin. Community circles 
announced that there had been progress in the development of 
plans for an exchange of letters between Russia and the European 
Union to regulate trade in nuclear materials in the framework of 
the partnership and cooperation agreement. However, it was also 
noted that the negotiations are not over and must be pursued. 
The Commission services will undoubtedly contact the 
delegations of the Member States regarding the wording under 
consideration. Pending a compromise on the nuclear dossier (in 
particular the conditions for the import of Russian uranium by 
the EU), two other aspects remain open: the regime of access to 
the Russian market for EU banks and shipping.

<F P=106> [EC Document No DOC. /IP/94/381: "TACIS Continues To </F>
Support the Improvement of Security of Nuclear Facilities in 
NIS"] 
  [Text] TACIS, the European Union's programme of assistance 
to the republics of the former Soviet Union, is working with the 
partner countries to reinforce the security of the existing 
reactors and other civilian nuclear facilities and to strengthen 
the responsible supervisory bodies in this area. TACIS is by 
far the largest donor in the world working with the new 
independent states to improve nuclear safety. 
  TACIS has recently launched a number of new projects in 
nuclear safety within the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Some 
of these projects build on initial work carried out under 
earlier TACIS projects, and prepare the way for continued TACIS 
support. 
  At the Kalinin NPP [nuclear power plant], for instance, 
TACIS 
experts have been working for some time with the operators of 
the plant to supervise the purchase of urgently needed 
safety-related equipment. The Kalinin NPP will receive 
laboratory analysis equipment within the coming weeks. A second 
phase of the programme has recently been launched to install and 
test the equipment and to train the relevant personnel in its 
operation. 
  In addition, TACIS experts will remain on-site for the next 
18 months to work with the plant operators on all aspects of 
operation and maintenance and prepare technical specifications 
for the purchase of additional safety equipment. Russian 
experts will also travel to the EU member states to study the 
operation of EU NPPs. 
  At the Kola NPP, TACIS experts are working to prepare for 
the 
installation of the new digital system to control the reactor 
core. This system will significantly improve the safety level of 
the reactor. The work of the TACIS experts involves defining 
the current system, producing a detailed technical specification 
and financial proposal for upgrading the system and an 
implementation and testing schedule. 
  Tube cleaning and debris filter equipment for the Balakovo 
NPP is being constructed, and will be sent to the plant in 
August 1994. 
  The on-site component will be continued and widened with the 
inclusion of a ninth site, the Zaporozhe NPP in Ukraine. 
Projects will be carried out at the site, with equipment needs 
met for up to 40 percent of the budget. Urgently needed spare 
parts in large quantities are also being delivered to other 
Ukrainian NPPs (Rovno and South Ukraine). 
  In another project, TACIS experts are making a detailed 
study 
of the degradation of the irradiated areas of reactor pressure 
vessels. This study will provide an important insight into the 
current state of irradiated vessels and the effectiveness of 
maintenance procedures adopted to date. 
<H5>  Studies </H5>
  Some feasibility studies are already available, including 
those for a vver-230 simulator and for an early warning system 
(Ukraine and Belarus). The results of the latter are currently 
being applied in a pilot project. A team of training personnel 
at the main training centre in Russia is exchanging know-how 
with the beneficiary, and a number of studies carried out at 
various Russian NPPs cover subjects such as accident analysis, 
vessel embrittlement, and quality assurance. 
  At the Chernobyl NPP in Ukraine, European Union experts have 
carried out fire protection training and a decontamination 
project for plant personnel. There is a separate 
decontamination project for the area 30 km around Chernobyl, 
plus a regional programme to provide social and economic 
assistance to those who have suffered from the fall-out in 
Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. The EU's Ukraine nuclear safety 
programme has committed over 80 Mecu from 1992 to 1994 to 
Ukraine. 
<H5>  Safety Authorities </H5>
  The enhancement of regulatory regimes responsible for the 
safety of national nuclear installations was identified as a 
priority under the TACIS nuclear safety programme. Assisstance 
efforts aim to support the development of independent, legally 
and technically competent regulatory authorities. 
  After several exploratory missions, two large projects were 
launched in December 1993, for the benefit of Russian and 
Ukrainian regulators. EU safety authorities have established a 
detailed programme to assist in the development of a strong 
legal and technical basis for the national regulators and their 
support organisations. This includes the transfer of codes, 
guidelines, and licensing procedures. The EU is also procuring 
the infrastructure of the equipment, to be delivered in the 
coming months, to improve the infrastructure of the regulators, 
including the vital link between headquarters, regional offices, 
and inspection centres. 
  At the Rovno NPP, Ukraine, a large-scale safety evaluation 
of 
vver-type reactors is currently nearing completion. 
<H5>  Nuclear Safety Account </H5>
  The EU has committed 20 Mecu to the nuclear safety account 
fund, which will finance actions concentrating on urgent 
upgrading for the least safe reactors in the CIS (rbmk and 
vver-230). The decision has been taken so far to finance 
upgrading projects at NPPs in Bulgaria and Lithuania, and 
projects are being prepared to be carried out in Russia and 
Ukraine. 
  International Science and Technology Centre (ISTC) 
  The union has committed 20 Mecu to the ISTC, designed to 
develop and finance specific projects which aim to redirect the 
skills of NIS weapons specialists towards civilian sectors and 
therefore to reduce the risk of proliferation. The centre 
became operational in March 1994, and a large series of 
nuclear-related projects has been launched.

<F P=106> [Bernard Gray report: "European Fighter Takes Off Into </F>
Flak"] 
  [Text] Mr Volker Riihe, German defence minister and 
reluctant co-parent of the Eurofighter 2000, was conspicuous by 
his absence at yesterday's official unveiling at Warton, in 
northern England. He apparently had an important meeting with 
South Korea's defence minister in Germany, which stopped him 
attending the christening of the 30 billion pound project. 
  His absence fuelled suspicion that his well-known scepticism 
about the Eurofighter remains undiminished. Certainly, his 
deputy, Mr Jorg Schoenbohm, waxed long about the responsibility 
of manufacturers to keep down the cost of the ambitious project, 
which aims to meet Europe's air defence needs for the next 20 
years. 
  Mr Schoenbohm was extremely cautious about committing 
Germany 
to the production phase of the aircraft. It was, he said, "a 
decision which requires very broad consensus and no decisions 
can be taken until after the (federal) elections" later this 
year. He added: "Eurofighter is not a monopoly supplier. 
Germany has other options." 
  The Spanish minister, Mr Julian Garcia Vargas, also tempered 
his enthusiasm with warnings that "we must think very carefully 
before we spend every peseta". 
  Perhaps Mr Ruhe simply stayed away to avoid the 
embarrassment 
of a grounded aircraft. It was a typically robust Lancashire 
spring day at British Aerospace's Warton airfield and officials 
grumbled all morning that wind might keep Europe's most 
expensive baby on the ground. 
  But there was no need to worry. The aircraft took off on 
time and, after a number of passes over the field, came together 
with Tornado, Jaguar, Harrier and Hawk fighters in an impressive 
"diamond nine" close formation. 
  All the tools of the marketing trade were there to help the 
Eurofighter on its way. In scenes which would have amazed the 
Spitfire's designers, straw boaters and smoke lasers and light 
shows filled the hangar. Some of the proud parents were 
unstinting in their praise. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence 
secretary, said that as well as developing technology and 
protecting jobs, Eurofighter would give pilots the confidence to 
tackle "any tasks we may ask them to undertake." 
  The aircraft is intended to beat any fighter currently under 
design, apart from the U.S. F-22, which is much more expensive. 
At present, Europe has nothing decisively superior to the 
Russian Mig-20. 
  The Italian minister, Mr Fabio Fabbri, was similarly 
enthusiastic, though all ministers shied away from revealing how 
many they would buy. 
  Although political uncertainty continues, at least the 
technical capacity of the Eurofighter is becoming clear. The 
test pilots say it is a great success. While they continue with 
development work, they will have to hope that the politicians 
continue to agree.

European Parliament's Approval"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 4 May (BELGA) -- Prime Minister Jean-Luc 
Dehaene immediately expressed his satisfaction following the 
European Parliament's (EP) approval, on Wednesday [4 May] 
afternoon, of the Accession Treaties to the European Union (EU) 
for Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Norway. 
  "This approval marks a major step along the road to rapid 
and 
effective EU membership for these countries. By the vote of the 
representatives directly elected by European citizens, the EP 
has thus shown that the Union is effectively opening up to such 
an enlargement. In so doing, Europe is giving a very clear 
signal to the citizens of Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Norway, 
confirming that they are welcome within the Union," the Belgian 
leader stated in a communique. 
  "The Belgian Government, which had made EU enlargement one 
of 
the priorities of its presidency, would like to thank the EP for 
having voted on enlargement at this opportune moment."

<F P=106> [Article signed MAE: "Initial Investigation for `Purple' </F>
Seems Inevitable"] 
  [Text] The Hague, 4 May (ANP) -- It is pretty much definite 
that the first option to be investigated in the upcoming 
government formation in the Netherlands is the "purple" 
coalition comprising social democrats (PvdA [Labor Party]), 
leftist liberals (D66 [Democrats 66]), and rightist liberals 
(VVD [Peolple's Party for Freedom and Democracy]). Although, on 
Wednesday [4 May] none of the newly elected floor leaders wanted 
to make any explicit statement about the advice which they will 
offer the Queen, it appears that an initial investigation is 
inevitable. 
  With the four parties that have, since Thursday, become 
"almost the same size," just as many combinations of three are 
conceivable. A future coalition will consist of at least three 
parties, now that a duo cannot count on a majority in the Second 
Chamber. 
  During the election campaign, PvdA leader Wim Kok and his 
VVD 
counterpart, Frits Bolkestein, both ruled out a combination of 
the PvdA, the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], and the VVD, 
meaning that there would be just three possibilities in the 
upcoming formation talks. 
  In all these coalitions, the participation of Thursday's 
biggest winner, Hans van Mierlo's D66, is essential. As one of 
the four large parties, van Mierlo made it quite clear well 
before the elections which coalition he felt deserved 
preference. "That would be purple, purple, purple, and once 
again purple," as a prominent D66 member of parliament 
emphasized on Wednesday. 
  This arrangement, in fact, leaves little choice for the 
other 
major players in the formation. This applies in the first 
instance to Kok, who, as the leader of the largest party, should 
with reason have the initiative in forming the government. Due 
to van Mierlo's preference, he is more or less compelled to 
first set about trying to form a coalition of the PvdA, the D66, 
and the VVD, even though the PvdA leader has made it known that 
he certainly expects something more from a coalition between the 
PvdA, the D66, and the CDA. 
  Also on Wednesday, Kok continued to keep his options open, 
repeating what he always said during the election campaign. The 
PvdA wants to work together with the D66 for "strong, 
progressive support," and to form a government with a third 
party. Whether this third party will be the CDA or the VVD 
depends on the policy that can be followed with these parties. 
One tough issue in particular for the PvdA leader is the future 
of the social security system. "We feel that policy is more 
important than `color,'" Kok said. 
  Nevertheless, he will probably have to tell the Queen on 
Friday that she will not be able to back away from van Mierlo's 
wish either. Two politicians from the PvdA and the D66, will 
have to investigate next week whether serious coalition talks 
are possible between the PvdA, the D66, and the VVD. It is 
inevitable that these politicians will also make a courtesy call 
to Brinkman. However, the CDA will get a real chance in the 
government formation if it turns out that a "purple" coalition 
looks impossible.

<F P=106> [Colin Brown article: "Pro-Europe Group Set for Battle"] </F>
  [Text] Tory MPs belonging to the Positive Europe group 
have called a meeting at Westminster next week to discuss its 
strategy for dealing with the ascendancy of Euro-sceptics. 
  Some warned that the anger of the pro-European Tory MPs 
could 
be held back, but only until after the European elections. They 
denied they were the new "Euro-bastards", but their patience is 
growing thin. 
  Some are threatening to break cover if the Tory manifesto 
for 
the European elections is Euro-sceptic in tone. 
  "Euro-enthusiasts" angrily accused Michael Portillo of 
mounting a leadership bid with his own agenda on Europe. 
Officers of the group privately demanded a firm rebuke from 
John Major. "If he doesn't stop Portillo now, his leadership is 
finished," a senior member said. One ministerial source said: 
"Every time he fails to slap them down, he lets the 
Euro-sceptics move a step further." 
  They rejected the Euro-sceptics' allegation that 
pro-Europeans are now a tiny party minority and had become a 
mirror image of "bastards" who opposed Maastricht. 
  The only member of the group to attack Mr Portillo publicly 
was Hugh Dykes, who accused him of breaching policy by openly 
opposing a single European currency. 
  The group claims the support of about 80 Tory MPs. None of 
its leaders is a natural trouble-maker. They include Ray 
Whitney, a former minister; Ian Taylor, parliamentary aide to 
William Waldegrave; Emma Nicholson, another parliamentary aide; 
Ralph Howell, a senior backbencher; and Jacqui Lait, MP for 
Hastings. 
  Backbench supporters include party stalwarts such as Sir 
Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, an officer of the 1922 Committee, Tom 
King, former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and Graham 
Bright, the Prime Minister's Parliamentary aide. Other founding 
members have been promoted by Mr Major as ministers, including 
Michael Ancram and Sir John Wheeler, both Northern Ireland 
ministers. 
  The most ardent pro-Europeans -- Mr Dykes, David Madel, 
David 
Knox and Robert Hicks -- are also members of Nick's Diner, the 
wets' dining club. Some privately admit their problem is that 
they are seen as "wet" and unlikely to cause the difficulty for 
Mr Major that the anti-Maastricht "bastards" did. But if they 
sense they are losing the battle for Europe, that will be the 
point at which the pro-Europeans adopt the tactics of the 
"bastards."

<F P=106> [Robert Chote and Donald Macintyre report: "Clarke Insists </F>
on Need for Strong Welfare State"] 
  [Text] Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, 
said yesterday that Britain needed a strong welfare state to 
help people cope with the volatile wages and spells of 
unemployment which were a natural result of making industry and 
the jobs market more flexible. 
  In a clear attempt to reestablish the party's appeal to the 
centre ground, the Chancellor said in the annual Mais lecture at 
City University in London that the uncertainty of the jobs 
market could leave people fearful of change and opposed to it. 
  "Not only adequate state welfare provision but a whole range 
of other social policies should alleviate such fears and offer a 
sense of security in a world where retraining and changes of job 
are becoming necessary events in most people's working lives," 
he said. 
  Mr Clarke's emphasis on social policies dearly 
differentiated 
him from Michael Portillo, his deputy at the Treasury and a 
likely rival in any Tory leadership contest. It also threatened 
tension between them in drawing up this year's tax and public 
spending plans. 
  The Chancellor hinted in his speech that the Budget might 
include reforms of the social security system to improve 
incentives for the low paid. These might include changes to 
Family Credit and Income Support to make it more worthwhile for 
the unemployed to take work and for low earners to seek higher 
paid jobs. Mr Portillo is keen to limit the cost of benefits 
through means-testing, which tends to worsen incentives. 
  Mr Clarke's frequent complaints that any important 
pronouncement he makes is interpreted as a naked leadership bid 
would almost certainly be justified on this occasion. If 
anything, it is a coherent attempt to do on domestic issues what 
Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, has done for European 
policy: to drag the party's centre of gravity back from where 
many on the Thatcherite right would like it to be. By 
reasserting the importance of the welfare state, Mr Clarke has 
rejected suggestions that it is inherently left wing to suggest 
that economic change should be humanely managed. 
  Mr Clarke said that tackling unemployment had to be "the 
main 
preoccupation of economic policymakers in the 1990's," but 
argued that the free-market approach successfully used to create 
jobs in the US had to be tempered. "The American approach 
results in unacceptably low levels of social support across the 
range for those not in work, as well as those employed," he said. 
  One of the Chancellor's key themes was the need for the 
Government to help people cope with the job changes and periods 
of unemployment which result from a more flexible labour market. 
He promised measures next year to make it easier for people to 
transfer their pensions when they change jobs, adding that 
mortgages also had to be more flexible to cope with greater 
fluctuations in incomes. 
  "No individual will see any advantage in a flexible labour 
market unless he or she sees how career prospects and life-cycle 
finances can be enhanced by it," he said. 
  He urged a move away from direct measures to help the less 
well- off, arguing that people needed to be given greater 
opportunities to take part in the market economy, which required 
better education. 
  He rejected the notion, long proclaimed by Thatcherites in 
Britain and Reaganites in the US, that the benefits of buoyant 
economic growth would trickle down to the less well-off. A 
strong welfare state was therefore needed to help people who 
were unable to work. 
  The Chancellor said employers' demands for skilled workers 
had widened the gap between the high and the low paid, and that 
it was unclear how much further this would go. But the 
Government should try to equip the low paid for more highly paid 
work rather than using tax and benefits to narrow the gap.

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- South Korean Defense Minister 
Pyong-tae Yi ended his three-day visit to Germany in Berlin on 5 
May. The visitor laid a wreath at the memorial to the 
resistance fighters of 20 July 1944. 
  A Bundeswehr press officer said that on the sidelines of the 
ceremony, the politician had said he did not currently see a 
danger of war for his country. However, the North Korean troops 
were holding military exercises. Tensions between the two parts 
of Korea increased over the past months because of the DPRK's 
nuclear program. 
  The minister had met with his German counterpart, Volker 
Ruehe, in Bonn on 4 May. During their talk, both agreed on 
closer defense and military policy cooperation between the 
Federal Republic of Germany and South Korea.

  [Text] Bonn -- Coordination of policies, including both 
countries' claim to a seat on the UN Security Council, was among 
the issues that Japan's Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata discussed 
with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in Bonn on Thursday [5 May]. 
With this meeting the newly elected head of government started 
off his political talks. During his 24-hour stay in Germany he 
will also meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who will host a 
dinner for Hata tonight. 
  The main topics to be discussed will be Japan's one-sided 
foreign trade balance, and thus its relations with the European 
Union, with which Hata will have talks in Brussels on Friday. 
Before travelling to Bonn, Japan's head of government said in 
Paris that his country's trade surplus is unhealthy. Japan is 
the FRG's major trading partner in the Far East. The government 
in Bonn is likely to draw Hata's attention to investment 
opportunities in the new laender.

  [Excerpts] Bonn -- Germany and Japan want to expand their 
relations and coordinate their policies on international issues 
more closely. Japan's new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel agreed in Bonn on Thursday [5 May] 
that Russia's reform course and the Central and Eastern European 
countries must be supported by both countries. According to the 
Foreign Ministry, they consider the unsolved nuclear problem in 
North Korea -- Pyongyang is refusing inspectors of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency access to its nuclear 
facilities -- a threat to the worldwide concern for 
non-proliferation. 
  Coordination of policies also includes both Germany's and 
Japan's efforts to obtain permanent seats on the UN Security 
Council. Hata and Kinkel pointed out that the United Nations' 
role in conflict prevention and peacekeeping has increased 
enormously worldwide. They stressed their intention to give the 
United Nations every support in fulfilling this task. 
  Hata, who was welcomed with military honors by Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, had been in Rome and Paris before coming 
to Germany for a two-day visit. Before going on to Brussels on 
Friday, he will meet with North Rhine-Westphalian Minister 
President Johannes Rau. 
  Beside bilateral relations, the topics Hata discussed with 
Kohl included both countries' wish to step up trade, which 
amounted to 45.3 billion German marks [DM] last year. The FRG's 
foremost aim is to reduce the DM17 billion deficit. In this 
connection, the Federal Government and German industry are 
mainly interested in the Japanese markets being opened to 
exports. [passage omitted] 
  Hata and Kinkel stressed that both their countries show 
signs 
of economic recovery. The relationship between Germany and 
Japan is "friendly and free of problems."

  [Text] Bonn -- During their visits to Bonn on Wednesday [4 
May], Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezavicius and Slovak 
Republic Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan asked for German support 
with their plans to join European institutions. The Foreign 
Ministry reported that separate talks that Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel had with the two politicians centered around 
questions of the future situation in Europe and Euro-Atlantic 
security structures. 
  Kinkel assured Slezavicius that it was in Germany's interest 
to move Lithuania close to the European Union [EU], the Western 
European Union, and NATO as quickly as possible. Expanding 
relations between the three Baltic states and the European Union 
will be an important item on the agenda of Germany's EU 
presidency that starts on 1 July. 
  The Lithuanian prime minister also met with Minister 
Friedrich Bohl in the Chancellor's Office and had talks with 
Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt. The Economics Ministry 
reports that trade figures between the FRG and Lithuania show a 
favorable balance. At 17 percent, the FRG is Lithuania's most 
important foreign trade partner. As many as 500 joint ventures 
have been formed so far. 
  According to the Foreign Ministry, the Slovak foreign 
minister started a three-day visit to Germany on Wednesday. 
Before taking off for Germany, Kukan said that he also wants to 
appeal to German companies to get more involved in Slovakia.

  [Text] Bonn, May 5: General Jerzy Gotowala, the 
commander-in-chief of the Polish Air-Forces, and his German 
counterpart General Hans-Joerg Kuebart on Thursday [5 May] 
agreed to expand cooperation between the Air-Forces of Poland 
and Germany. 
  They decided that Polish and German Air-Forces should offer 
help to the other side in special situations and inform the 
other side of the intended operations in the border-line areas. 
Poland and Germany will also propose to Sweden and Denmark 
joint manouevres in the Baltic Sea. 
  "My talks are linked to Poland's approaching to Western 
defence structures," Gen. Gotowala said. 
  Poland also aims to coordinate its charity actions with 
German and international operations as it sometines happens that 
Polish planes with humanitarian aid must wait for their turn to 
come to unload the cargo. Closer cooperation with German 
Air-Forces may help to include Poland in the international 
system of charity operations. 
  After the talks, General Gotowala visited air-bases in the 
north of Germany. The visit, that started on May Wednesday, is 
to end on Friday.

  [Text] Wuensdorf (DPA) -- Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, 
supreme commander of the Russian troops in Germany, has 
resolutely rejected a farewell ceremony for Russian soldiers in 
Weimar. "Weimar is absolutely unacceptable for us," said 
Burlakov in an interview with the German Press Agency at the 
Russian military headquarters in Wuensdorf (Brandenburg) on 5 
May. The German side suggested a festive ceremony with Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 
Weimar on 31 August, and subsequently, a brief farewell for the 
troops in Berlin. 
  Burlakov voiced the hope that the decision on the place and 
type of the ceremony would be changed during Yeltsin's visit to 
Bonn beginning on 11 May. "Weimar has nothing to do with our 
stay here," said Burlakov, adding that it was the U.S. troops 
that had taken Weimar at the end of World War II. The general 
again referred to the former concentration camp of Buchenwald 
near Weimar, where, among others, 19,000 Soviet citizens were 
assassinated. 
  The chief of the Western Group for his part suggested that 
all troops deployed in Germany should be seen off in a common 
ceremony, immediately following the meeting of the seven most 
important Western industrial states and Russia in Naples early 
in July. So far, a separate ceremony -- without the Russians -- 
has been envisaged for the three Western allies in Berlin on 8 
September. "We are liquidating the consequences of World War 
II," said Burlakov. "There should be a common farewell ceremony 
for all armies from Germany." He added: "I think the 
Americans, French, and British would agree." If the German side 
did not accept this, the former four occupation powers should 
each be seen off separately, said the general. 
  "The president agrees with me on this problem," stressed 
Burlakov. He said that chief of state Yeltsin had submitted the 
Russian proposals to Chancellor Kohl in writing. "It was Berlin 
where World War II ended, and it should be Berlin from where the 
last Russian soldier should go back home," said Burlakov.

  [Text] Saarbruecken (DPA) -- German industry places great 
expectations on the enlargement of the European Union. The 
acceptance of Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Austria, which was 
approved by the European Parliament on Wednesday [4 May], 
creates additional opportunities for investments, for German 
companies also, Tyll Necker, president of the Federation of 
German Industry (BDI), said on Saarland Radio on Thursday. 
"There will be a great number of improved opportunities for 
cooperation." 
  German industry need not fear potential greater competition 
by the new members, Necker said. Rather, there is the 
opportunity for a better division of labor within Europe. Thus, 
the Nordic states are, for instance, strong regarding the 
production of cellulose. Traffic routes to Scandinavia could 
also be improved and expanded. The decisive thing is "that we 
will all become stronger in international competition through a 
larger market," Necker stressed.

  [Text] Karlsruhe (DPA) -- A former official of the Workers 
Party of Kurdistan [PKK] was seriously injured by several shots 
fired at him in Krefeld on 2 May. According to statements made 
by the Federal Prosecutor's Office on 4 May, there is a 
suspicion that the crime was committed by members of a terrorist 
group within the PKK, because the 33-year-old victim intended to 
leave the Workers Party. 
  In June 1992, the Higher Regional Court in Celle sentenced 
the former high PKK official to a prison term of four years and 
two months for serious deprivation of liberty and dangerous 
injury. Meanwhile, he has served his prison term. The federal 
prosecutor general has asked the Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigation to conduct the investigations on the attack.

<F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia economist Antonio Martino by </F>
Alberto Statera; place and date not given: "Politics Has 
Infected Him"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Statera] Mr. Martino, what 
impression are you making on your friends in Chicago, who hoped 
to see an immediate victory for the inalienable rules of the 
market? 
  [Martino] I received a telephone call from one of my 
teachers 
in Chicago, who told me: "People will say that you belong to 
the `Chicago boy's' government, but you must be realistic and 
acknowledge that you are now, by virtue of your age, a `Chicago 
man.'" 
  [Statera] That is amusing, Mr. Martino, but there is also a 
real problem: You formulated an election program based on 
extreme economic liberalism, but now the prime 
minister-designate is engaging in consultations for all he is 
worth. What is your opinion of his meetings with the so-called 
social partners? 
  [Martino] Bad, very bad: How could I deny it? I cannot 
approve of consultations with the social partners. An advocate 
of economic liberalism such as myself cannot accept the very 
idea of pay trends being determined from the top. That would be 
an abandonment of my principles. 
  [Statera] And so? 
  [Martino] So I am reassured by the fact that consultations 
of 
this kind will make no difference, insofar as pay trends will 
violate any ceiling. Pay trends do not honor agreements. 
  [Statera] What do you man? 
  [Martino] That if a firm is doing well, nobody can prevent 
it 
from increasing wages above the set ceilings. 
  [Statera] What would your friends in Chicago say about 
Berlusconi's consultations? 
  [Martino] That whatever does no harm is tolerable. In this 
specific instance, it is an old ritual of give and take that is 
tolerable if we succeed in achieving the harmony essential for 
creating the conditions for development. Unfortunately, there 
is no such thing as a free lunch. 
  [Statera] As Friedman said? 
  [Martino] No, the attribution to Friedman is a common one, 
but mistaken. Do you know who said it? An Italian emigre in 
the United States. What he said was more or less this: "This 
is a great country but it does not give any free lunches." 
  [Statera] If that is so, does it mean that there are no free 
lunches for Mr. Berlusconi, either? 
  [Martino] Precisely. There are no free lunches for anyone. 
  [Statera] Has the lunch been paid for? 
  [Martino] It is my opinion that pledges must be honored. But 
then there must be no more consultations, with the rationale of 
the grand three-way agreements. The government is not an 
arbiter between the social partners; it simply establishes the 
rules. Then employers and trade unions can reach their own 
agreements. 
  [Statera] Pardon me, Mr. Martino, you will be a minister in 
a 
government whose likely prime minister is already following 
ideological guidelines with which you do not agree. Do you 
consider that normal? 
  [Martino] It seems to me that in this instance it is an 
acceptable compromise, and the word "compromise" applies more to 
me than to Berlusconi, because he has always spoken to me about 
his desire to engage in dialogue with the social partners. 
However, I am of course talking personally; I am stating my 
opinions, and I reaffirm that not everything can be negotiated 
with the social partners. 
  [Statera] If you continue to say one thing and your 
colleagues another, does this not pose a danger to the prime 
minister? 
  [Martino] Mr. Berlusconi has asked me to make it clear when 
I 
am talking in a personal capacity and illustrating my own 
opinions, which is what I am doing now. Many of us are new to 
politics, but for this very reason I foresee an attitude of 
great cooperation. 
  [Statera] Berlusconi too is new to active politics, but he 
is 
displaying wonderful qualities as a Doroteo. Do you remember 
the Santa Dorotea convent at which that Christian Democratic 
faction was formed? 
  [Martino] I think it is not Doroteism, but an inevitable 
compromise, the price to be paid for the first lunch. 
Berlusconi has been infected by the political virus more 
severely than you can imagine. He would even be willing to sell 
everything as long as he could engage in politics. 
  [Statera] Pardon me, Mr. Martino, but we have an even worse 
suspicion -- namely, that you have been diverted from economics 
to foreign policy because the government's line will not 
actually be so committed to economic liberalism, because your 
policies will be set aside somewhat, because -- if I may be 
permitted to say so -- some people perhaps believe that less 
harm can be done at the Foreign Ministry. 
  [Martino] Do you mean that I will be given the Foreign 
Ministry as a way of rendering me harmless? 
  [Statera] More or less. 
  [Martino] Well, I deny that absolutely: I willingly agreed 
to the suggestion of the Foreign Ministry, and I consider it a 
very prominent position. 
  [Martino] Will the Berlusconi government not align with the 
economic policy of the Amato and Ciampi governments, more out of 
necessity than out of conviction? 
  [Statera] I really hope that this does not happen, and 
indeed 
I am certain of it: You cannot increase revenue without working 
on the decisionmaking rules affecting expenditure. 
  [Martino] Be that as it may, you will be at the Foreign 
Ministry. 
  [Martino] Yes, and very gladly. At present I am doing my 
homework, examining the unresolved issues. They are alarmingly 
numerous and difficult.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League ideologue Gianfranco </F>
Miglio by Gianluigi Da Rold in Como; date not given: "Miglio 
Tells Bossi: Either Federalism or a Nasty Death"] 
  [Text] Como -- Professor Gianfranco Miglio is a bit 
disappointed with the political situation, with [League 
Secretary] Umberto Bossi's actions, and with the League. Living 
like a commuter between his splendid Como and Domaso homes, he 
observes political developments with an academic's eye. 
  [Da Rold] What is all this disappointment about, Professor 
Miglio? 
  [Miglio] My friend Bossi is not being forceful enough in 
demanding reforms. He is wavering. The Northern League's 
raison d'etre was basically that of demanding federal reform. 
Otherwise, the League has no justification for existence, and 
this may lead to decline, which is what [Prime 
Minister-designate] Berlusconi is hoping for. 
  [Da Rold] There seems to be no leadership problem within the 
League. 
  [Miglio] I am not saying anything of the sort. The problem 
lies in the fact that there are few men in the League who have 
the stature to govern a country. There is not a very wide 
spectrum. There are no personalities. All this negotiating to 
obtain the Interior Ministry for Roberto Maroni is not very 
convincing either. Above all, Bossi is not coming up with a 
strategy for the necessary political growth, and at the same 
time he is facing fierce competition from Berlusconi among his 
voters. In fact, the League is an attack and protest structure, 
rather than one for governing. 
  [Da Rold] However, you too, professor, were not opposed to 
taking part in the government. 
  [Miglio] Except that we should have played in two different 
fields at once. We should have launched a great campaign for a 
constituent government. In such a situation, I agreed with a 
double negotiating table, including both a constituent assembly 
and the government. Such a separate table worked well at the 
time of the 1946 constituent assembly. As regards reform, the 
League would have had the opportunity to establish some form of 
cooperation with the Left, with the opposition. Now it is 
essentially folding back on the basic need to govern. 
  [Da Rold] It sounds like a rather crucial step. 
  [Miglio] If we do not change the rules of the game, if we do 
not establish a federal Constitution, within two or three years 
everything will revert to the previous situation. It is not 
enough, it is pointless to change the men alone. I believe that 
the new government is being formed around major economic 
interests. This amounts to restoring the First Republic. 
  [Da Rold] On what do you base this pessimistic analysis? 
  [Miglio] In the first place, a formidable group of economic 
tycoons is being reconstituted. This group will gain the 
ascendancy as economic recovery gets under way, as soon as 
Berlusconi has formed his new government. There are men waiting 
for opportunities to invest and speculate. This will be the 
driving force behind recovery, which will last six months or a 
year perhaps. 
  Second, it will be mainly the bourgeoisie linked to the 
great 
economic and financial interests who will benefit from recovery. 
The other bourgeoisie, that of small and medium businessmen, 
will still have to bear the tax burden of the services to be 
paid. In the end, there will be a clash, as Piero Ostellino has 
lucidly written. Only as far as the final scenario is concerned 
do I disagree with Ostellino: If big business wins, there will 
be an authoritarian government; if small business wins, we will 
finally have a federal republic and democracy. 
  [Da Rold] A clash? 
  [Miglio] A revolutionary stage, which will not be morbid in 
nature like the one we witnessed over the last few years. 
  [Da Rold] Do you believe that Berlusconi is linked to the 
great economic tycoons? Do you not agree that the Knight 
[Berlusconi nickname] may be able to reconcile the interests of 
the two sections of the bourgeoisie? 
  [Miglio] I think that it is impossible. Not because I wish 
Berlusconi to fail, as some people believe, nor because I myself 
believe that the Knight has personally chosen those tycoons. 
Only, Berlusconi is objectively a prisoner. In order to 
govern, he will have to, on the one hand, concede something to 
the south; and, on the other, he will come up against men like 
[Mediobanca President] Enrico Cuccia, who have ready answers: 
We must concentrate this country's wealth, we cannot place our 
trust in the small and medium businesses' international 
vitality. When I listen to this kind of reasoning, I feel very 
disheartened. 
  [Da Rold] Is there no way a revolutionary upheaval can be 
avoided? 
  [Miglio] Only by establishing a federal Constitution. When 
Bossi said "federalism within 90 days," I answered "I am ready." 
But now we are getting lost in the petty details of government. 
Bossi is wavering, and he is no longer asking for a major 
change. Bossi's lieutenants are ready to give up a major change 
in favor of taking part in the government. As regards 
Berlusconi, he ought to perform an act of courage... 
  [Da Rold] You do not seem to trust that he is capable of 
such 
an act of courage. 
  [Miglio] How can he be? I have already suggested that 
Berlusconi is a prisoner of the game. In addition, there is his 
movement, abounding in former Christian democrats, who do not 
want a liberal democratic party and still believe in going along 
with the current. They want a new version of the First Republic. 
  [Da Rold] What would be needed, then? 
  [Miglio] A sweeping force. In short: either revolution or a 
nasty death -- among other things, in a Europe which would no 
longer be federal, but in which the national states would be 
reconstituted.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto </F>
Bossi by Giovanni Cerruti in Rome; date not given: "I Could 
Even Vote Against Them"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Cerruti] Honorable Bossi, 
what are you doing? Are you shouting orders at the Berlusconi 
government, are you making the first step toward a break, or are 
you announcing that the League has outside backing? 
  [Bossi] None of these. It is a pause. A pause for reflection 
that we are conceding to Berlusconi, and also to the country. 
  [Cerruti] To the country? 
  [Bossi] Perhaps people have not understood well. I agree 
that the desire for a stable government prevails. However, it 
is necessary to consider that this Berlusconi does not have a 
party behind him, but a band to fill the void. He cannot 
provide any guarantee of democracy, other than his three damn 
guarantors.... 
  [Cerruti] It may also be a pause, but it has the tone of a 
clash. Is this all because of the "no" to the Viminale 
[Interior Ministry]? 
  [Bossi] It is not just the Viminale. In the meantime that 
man [Berlusconi] goes around hand in glove with AN [National 
Alliance]; not only does he not want to give us the Viminale, 
they also want to palm us off with the stuff they do not want. 
We are federalists, we have been fighting for the distribution 
of power for a lifetime, and that man wants to keep it all for 
himself: interior, foreign policy, treasury, justice, post 
office.... Who is he, Nembo Kid? 
  [Cerruti] He is Berlusconi. 
  [Bossi] Then he should start to respect the rules of 
democracy. He cannot summon the first political force 
represented in parliament and say: Here you are, take these 
less powerful ministries... Ooohhh! What does he think? When I 
got up he tried to make me stay, but I hope that he has 
understood one thing; the ideals of the League, starting with 
federalism, are not for sale. 
  [Cerruti] Are his members of parliament also asking that 
this 
government be formed? 
  [Bossi] I do not know, if it will be his personal 
government... He could even invoke Article 92 [of the 
Constitution] and go to the president of the republic, and then 
present himself in parliament and we will see. 
  [Cerruti] What will we see? 
  [Bossi] We will see if a coalition government with the 
political participation of the League can be set up. 
  [Cerruti] In this way we return to the obstacle of the 
Viminale and we are at the beginning again... 
  [Bossi] He would make us a present of three-quarters of the 
less powerful ministries rather than give it to us. All sorts 
of stories have been invented... 
  [Cerruti] What sort of stories? 
  [Bossi] [AN leader] Fini's sort. He says that we are from 
the North, and that we are unable to understand the problems of 
organized crime, the Mafia, and the South, and that we could not 
be relied upon. Just think, I have to get somebody from 
National Alliance, which is 85 percent Italian Social Movement, 
to give me a license to say that I am reliable! 
  [Cerruti] Today you are meeting the members of parliament 
from your party, tomorrow you should see Berlusconi and Fini 
again; it is said that the new prime minister could already make 
his debut in the Senate coming Tuesday [10 May] 
  [Bossi] What a rush. Let us wait until tomorrow's meeting. 
  [Cerruti] Will it be decisive? 
  [Bossi] It could be. However, I must make it clear that the 
League wants to be in the government to interfere, to control an 
autocrat who moves without even having a party, and who wants to 
put all his men into the board of directors of the Italian 
system. Heh! Wake up! The autocrat is extremely dangerous. 
  [Cerruti] And this is why you decided to suspend the 
meetings? 
  [Bossi] This is our resistance, and it will become much 
stronger, because we know the dangers that lie ahead of us. 
That man has put four of our ideas together, and put them on 
his television, thanks to the lack of regulations governing 
television. He took the votes, and now he wants to take the 
whole country. 
  [Cerruti] Honorable Bossi, is the Viminale still the last 
trench? 
  [Bossi] Yes, for that which comes under the Viminale, and I 
am referring most of all to the local authorities. 
  [Cerruti] Is there any condition under which you would cede 
it? 
  [Bossi] None. We want to be seen and to be decisive. We 
want to be the guarantors of democracy against the autocrat, and 
our resistance will continue.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Meets Media Guarantor; </F>
OK's `RAI-Saver'"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 3 -- Premier-designate Silvio 
Berlusconi, once the hands-on manager of most of Italy's private 
airwaves and still the owner of a sprawling media empire, this 
evening had talks with media guarantor Giuseppe Santaniello on 
broadcasting reform. 
  Santaniello reported that Berlusconi had shown the 
"political 
will" to keep in place the end-of-year fee-hiking and 
fund-boosting package for cash-strapped public broadcaster RAI 
[Italian Broadcasting Corporation]. The so-called RAI-saver has 
been a target of abuse from many of Berlusconi's governing 
partners, some of whom have called for the entire RAI management 
to stand down -- an eventuality Santaniello said had not entered 
this evening's talks. 
  Santaniello said the two men had tied the reform of Italy's 
virtual-duopoly broadcasting law -- increasingly invoked, 
especially on the opposition benches, after a right-left 
cross-fire of bias accusations, and centrist allegations of 
non-coverage, during the election campaign -- to the importance 
of developing new technologies like cable and satellite TV. 
  "Berlusconi takes an overview of all these problems, without 
taking sides and with an eye to RAI issues also," said 
Santaniello. 
  He would not be drawn into judging Berlusconi's appointment 
of three experts to draw up a solution to conflict of interest 
problems. Mirroring prevailing confusion on what these 
guarantors have been called on to guarantee, he indicated that 
they would be proposing a modification of the broadcasting law 
-- especially its anti-trust provisions -- rather than 
monitoring executive decisions affecting Berlusconi companies. 
  Also today, the premier-designate met the chairman of the 
anti- trust commission, Francesco Saja, pledging to foster rules 
of free competition. 
  Tomorrow the premier-designate will meet banking, chamber of 
commerce and shopkeepers' associations, as well as research and 
university bodies and the Italian housewives' federation. 
  In another break with precedent, he will also meet a 
delegation representing Italians abroad.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Russia/Italy: Italian Firm To Aid </F>
Russian Packaging Industry"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Moscow, May 4 -- The Italian firm Fata has 
signed a deal worth 80 million dollars (130 billion lire) to 
supply equipment and machinery for production of packaging 
materials to a plant in the Russian region of Tyumen, in west 
Siberia, company officials today announced. 
  The plant, to be built on the site of a former petrolium 
industry equipment supplier, is expected to have a yearly 
production of 16,000 [metric] tons of packaging materials 
consisting mainly of aluminum, card and paper sheets. 
  Russia's lack of packaging materials is considered one of 
the 
main reasons for the huge losses incurred by its agricultural 
sector, a situation only partially eased by the country's 
purchase in 1992-1993 of materials worth 190 million dollars.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Muslim Extremist Group in Perugia, </F>
Police Says"] 
  [Text] Perugia, May 4 [ANSA] -- Anti-terrorist police units 
in this north-central town on Tuesday [3 May] found two 
apartments which they said were probably being used as support 
bases for Algerian Muslim extremists of the Islamic Salvation 
Front (ISF). 
  Police officials said about 15 people living in the two 
apartments have been placed under investigation for falsifying 
papers and receiving stolen goods after searches in the 
apartments revealed false passports and identity cards and an 
unspecified number of cellular telephones, car stereos, cameras 
and other electronic equipment. 
  Also confiscated were Arab language newspapers and ISF 
propaganda leaflets, as well as "dozens" of videocassettes 
showing people wearing ski-masks and demonstrating how to use a 
variety of weapons, police said. 
  The nationalities of those under investigation, most of them 
between the ages of 20 and 25, were not revealed but 
investigators said they did not believe the group was preparing 
any attacks or engaging in paramilitary training.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Swiss-Saudi Economic Relations, </F>
Differences of Opinion on Price of Drugs"] 
  [Text] At the eighth meeting of the Swiss-Saudi Arabian 
Joint Economic Commission in Bern on 3 May, Federal Councilor 
Delamuraz and his guest, Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Aziz Bin-'Abdallah 
al-Zamil, Saudi minister of industry and electricity, 
underscored the strong economic relations between the two 
countries. Saudi Arabia would like to correct the trade 
imbalance, expand scientific cooperation, and increase the 
number of joint ventures. The thorny issue of prices of 
pharmaceutical goods is still a subject of discussion. 
  The two delegations consisted not only of representatives of 
various ministries, but also members of chambers of trade. On 
the Swiss side, there were also representatives of those 
industrial branches interested in entering the Saudi market. 
Saudi Arabia has emerged as a very keen consumer of Swiss 
products in recent years. Swiss exports to Saudi Arabia have 
increased from 859 million Swiss francs in 1990 to 1,491 million 
in 1993. Forty percent of these exports consist of jewelry, or 
50 percent when one includes watches. Chemical products and 
machines are also major Swiss exports to this country. 
  On the other hand, imports from Saudi Arabia have sunk 
dramatically. In 1990 they still amounted to 540 million 
francs, but in 1993 they only reached a level of 275 million. 
Ninety percent of Saudi Arabia's exports to Switzerland consist 
of gold and crude oil. Delamuraz expressed Switzerland's 
concern for more Saudi imports, and gave an assurance that there 
were no quantitative restrictions on exports outside the 
agricultural sphere. The Saudis mentioned the possibility of 
increased exports of petrochemical products to Switzerland, but 
Delamuraz said that Switzerland's market potential for such 
goods was rather small. 
  At the end of 1993 there were 21 industrial joint ventures 
involving Swiss capital in Saudi Arabia, plus another 19 joint 
ventures in the services sector. The Saudi delegation expressed 
its interest in an expansion of this cooperation, and suggested 
possible projects in the food, chemical, and plastics sectors, 
and in the production of instruments. These cooperation 
possibilities are to be discussed in greater depth at a special 
seminar in Geneva attended by representatives of Swiss private 
industry. In this connection, Federal Councilor Delamuraz 
recalled the usefulness of concluding an agreement on the 
protection of investments and on avoiding double taxation, and 
invited his guests to commence appropriate negotiations with 
Switzerland. 
  The Saudis were interested in scientific cooperation in, 
among other things, the electrical industry and in railroads. 
The ongoing difficult debate on the subject of prices of 
pharmaceutical goods was summarized, and referred to a separate 
commission for further talks. Until now, the Swiss factory 
prices of these goods, without the profit margins of pharmacies 
and wholesalers, have been used when setting prices in Saudi 
Arabia. In the future, the Saudis want to work out an average 
price on the basis of prices in 42 different countries, and 
apply this average price in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis explained 
this intention last year at a meeting in Basel. 
  The Swiss pharmaceutical industry representatives criticized 
this method as administratively cumbersome and insufficiently 
representative, because the list of drugs involves too many 
countries and provides too little information. On its part, the 
Swiss delegation suggested that instead of calculating prices of 
drugs on the basis of the prices in 42 countries, these prices 
should be calculated on the basis of prices in just seven 
countries whose economic performance is similar to Saudi 
Arabia's. Swiss drug manufacturers want to be certain that the 
prices of pharmaceutical goods exported to and sold in Saudi 
Arabia are sufficient to contribute to the costs of the 
manufacturer's research to an extent that befits the economy of 
an oil-producing country.

<F P=106> ["J.R." report: "Anguita Says Origin of Corruption Lies in </F>
Executive's Economic Policy"] 
  [Text] Julio Anguita, the general coordinator of the United 
Left (IU), said that the origin of the corruption lay beyond 
personal actions. "The evil runs deeper than the Roldan and 
Rubio affairs. It lies in a specific economic policy which is 
itself corrupt and also the origin of corruption," Anguita 
emphasized during the presentation of the IU's European campaign. 
  Yesterday, the leadership of the United Left approved, with 
two abstentions, a resolution demanding that Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez resign immediately as the best way of ensuring 
that the people can regain confidence in the institutions. 
"Gonzalez has repeatedly and sufficiently demonstrated his 
inability and his lack of willingness to rectify things. He has 
systematically failed to comply with all of his election 
promises. He does not have a shred of credibility," the 
resolution said. It also demanded the resignation of Carlos 
Solchaga, Jose Luis Corcuera, and Jose Barrionuevo. 
  However, for Anguita, the corruption scandals are only the 
fifth reason why the prime minister must go. According to the 
IU, Gonzalez is also responsible for the rise in unemployment, 
the destruction of industrial textiles, the economic policy, and 
the rise of the right. 
  As he has done in some of his latest public actions, the 
general coordinator emphatically called for "serenity, calm, and 
rationality" at this time, and made it clear that his group 
would in no case support a motion of censure which might be 
submitted by the People's Party. Anguita will turn a deaf ear 
to requests that he support a catharsis. These were made by 
various social sectors and the media. "We are not going to make 
it easy for either Gonzalez or Aznar," he added. 
  Anguita was confident that at the election on 12 June the 
"example of honesty, transparency, and clean hands" being set by 
the IU will be translated into votes. The IU hopes to gain at 
least seven seats in the European Parliament at the European 
elections. It currently has four. To this end, it will spend 
125 million pesetas during the campaign, plus another 360 
million on campaign mailings, according to the person in charge 
of the elections, Felix Martinez de la Cruz. The campaign 
slogan will be "Get a move on," and will be present at more than 
1,000 events. 
  The IU's leading candidate, socialist Alonso Puerta, has 
predicted that the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] will 
suffer a setback similar to the one suffered by their French 
counterparts at that country's last elections. He was confident 
that, "within this framework of anxiety," the citizens will be 
able to figure out that not all politicians work the same way. 
Puerta let slip the possibility that, after the elections, the 
IU would give its MEP's-elect the task of submitting an 
initiative to improve the ethical standards of European public 
life.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with UN Secretary General Butrus </F>
Butrus-Ghali by Kjell Dragnes in Oslo; no date given] 
  [Text] The UN role in Bosnia is not a fiasco, UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said. The problem has not been 
solved, but people are working actively so that it will be. 
  Fourteen years as Egyptian foreign minister, the peace 
settlement between Egypt and Israel in 1977, the many subsequent 
crises in the Middle East -- all of this was a tough, but good 
preparation for Butrus-Ghali who is now 71 years old and has 
been head of the United Nations since January 1991. "I believe 
that I am well-trained to tackle the many crises the United 
Nations has to tackle," the secretary general said in an 
interview with AFTENPOSTEN. 
  It is not a tired leader -- despite all the crises and the 
many rounds of talks here in Norway -- who today ends his 
two-day visit to Norway. The only thing he regrets is that he 
has no opportunity to travel home to Cairo to see one crisis 
move toward its solution: the signing of an agreement between 
the PLO and Israel tomorrow. 
  "But I have asked your Foreign Minister (Bjorn Tore) Godal 
to 
represent me," he said. 
  How do you view the development within the United Nations 
from peacekeeping to peacemaking operations? 
  "I think that we should clearly limit our role to 
peacekeeping, and this is in line with the spirit of the United 
Nations. But if we need peacemaking in order to be in a 
position to distribute food, to give humanitarian assistance, to 
stop those people who do not respect the resolutions adopted by 
the United Nations, who are committing genocide and atrocities, 
the international community should not hesitate to make use of 
peacemaking operations," the UN secretary general said. 
  He said that 15 of the UN's 17 operations are peacekeeping 
operations. Article 7 of the UN Charter gives scope for 
peacemaking operations, but it was only once the Cold War was 
over that these became possible. 
  It is in this context that Butrus-Ghali sees the former 
Yugoslavia. The general picture is that the United Nations has 
not had particular success, but the UN head does not agree. The 
United Nations has succeeded in preserving peace in Macedonia, 
has given aid to 2 million refugees and exiles, and on the whole 
has maintained the safe areas in Bosnia. 
  Thorvald Stoltenberg is given much praise for his role as 
mediator, and Butrus Butrus-Ghali was not sparing in his praise 
of Norway's efforts -- in the form of soldiers and money. With 
a scarcely audible sigh he said that if only others among the 
UN's 184 members had been as well-disposed.... Some 160 have 
not paid their membership fees or made contributions to the UN 
operations. The United Nations finds itself in the midst of a 
major economic crisis, with a deficit of $1 billion, and this 
does not make it any easier to tackle the world's problems. 
"But if the members contribute money and troops I am sure that 
the United Nations can tackle the various crises," the secretary 
general said emphatically. 
  The United Nations celebrates its 50th birthday next year. 
Many people take the view that the organization should be 
reformed. What is your view? 
  "We will have many ceremonies next year, and we hope that 
through these we will be able to mobilize world public opinion 
in favor of the United Nations, give a better picture of it, and 
win greater support for the organization," the secretary general 
said. "In addition there will be a very important conference in 
Copenhagen which will create a greater understanding of the 
social element -- something that is important these days." 
  The UN leadership has also distributed to member countries a 
questionnaire on reforms, especially of the Security Council. 
Most people are agreed that reforms are necessary, that new 
members should be admitted to the Council. But they disagree 
about which. "I believe that it will be a long debate," the 
general secretary said, adding, "I hope they will be able to 
accept certain fundamental changes to strengthen the Security 
Council and strengthen the UN system." 
  The message from the secretary general is that the reforms 
will be a long process, but once the member nations make up 
their minds to invest in the United Nations, demonstrate the 
political will, and realize that the United Nations is the only 
organization which can tackle global problems, they will then be 
on the right road. 
  Yesterday was filled with meetings, first with Prime 
Minister 
Gro Harlem Brundtland, then with Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore 
Godal, and then an audience at the Palace. Yesterday evening 
the prime minister hosted a dinner for the secretary general and 
his wife, Maria Leia Butrus-Ghali, at Akershus Castle. Today 
Butrus-Ghali will honor the memory of the very first UN 
secretary general, Trygve Lie, by laying a wreath on Lie's grave 
in Grorud churchyard. Talks at the Storting are also on the 
agenda before he travels on to Geneva this afternoon.

  [Text] Brussels, May 5 (AFP) -- European Trade Commissioner 
Sir Leon Brittan will this week renew calls for the total 
closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant during a visit to 
Ukraine, a spokesman said Thursday [5 May]. 
  The spokesman said Brittan, due in Ukraine Thursday and 
Friday, will stress the urgent need to close the facility, the 
site of the world's worst civilian nuclear accident, in April 
1986. 
  In Paris, French Environment Minister Michel Barnier said 
Thursday his government would submit a proposal to its European 
Union [EU] allies within 10 days for a concrete timetable for 
closing the two reactors still operating at the plant. 
  Barnier said France would seek approval for the project from 
both the EU and delegates at the G7 summit of leading 
industrialised nations in Naples in July. 
  Both he and the European Commission spokesman stressed the 
need to help ensure Ukraine has stable alternative sources of 
energy. 
  Western nuclear energy experts believe Chernobyl could fall 
victim to a second disaster if the plant is not shut down. 
  Energy-starved Ukraine says Chernobyl provides seven percent 
of the former Soviet republic's electricity and that it would 
need three billion dollars in financial compensation for 
shutting it down.

<F P=106> [Federico Geremicca report: "No Fascist Ministers: Crisis </F>
Between Scalfaro and European Parliament"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The motion was a very brief one, a mere five 
typewritten lines, and was approved by a single vote. Then, 
eight minutes later, came the terse reply from the president's 
office -- a few very sharp words conveyed in a note from the 
press office. And so, around 2130 hours [1930 GMT], the very 
day when Berlusconi's approach to the government experienced a 
dangerous step into the unknown, saw the explosion of a dispute 
that had remained concealed for some weeks -- that of the 
European Community with respect to the Italian Government that 
is about to be formed. The controversy stems from two anxieties 
-- concerning the presence of neofascist ministers in 
Berlusconi's cabinet and the possibility that the new government 
majority will adopt substantially anti-Community stances in 
foreign policy. 
<H5>  Socialists' Motion </H5>
  These are the facts, as they happened, in rapid succession. 
In Strasbourg, the seat of the European Parliament [EP], a 
session was devoted to the European Council meeting scheduled 
for 24-25 June in Corfu. The Socialist group -- after a series 
of meetings that morning among representatives of the various 
countries' socialist parties -- put the following motion to the 
vote: "The European Parliament demands that the members of the 
European Union make it known very clearly to the president of 
the Italian Republic that his government must be loyal to the 
fundamental principles that presided over the foundation of the 
Community, after the horrors of fascism and Nazism." 
  In the afternoon vote, the motion received 189 for and 188 
against. The AGI press agency did not report the news until 
2129 [1929 GMT], however, but a mere eight minutes later the 
president's office issued its reply (so the reply must have been 
ready for some time). 
  The four lines expressed resentment and disdain: "Italy's 
loyalty to the values and principles that lie at the root of the 
European constitution is a clear and undisputed fact that 
requires no reminders or teachers." 
  This was already a sufficiently sharp response, but the 
chief 
of state's aides went further, verbally: "Such a motion should 
not even have been put to the vote," they explained. "It is an 
unacceptable interference in another country's internal affairs. 
And its tone is also unacceptable -- with regard to the 
president of the Italian Republic, of course, but also with 
regard to the member countries of the Community, to which the 
Parliament has never been seen to address such verbs as `to 
demand....'" 
  But in fact there was something else that has never been 
seen 
before last night, and that is such a sharp and direct dispute 
between the European Parliament -- Europe, let us say -- and the 
chief of state of a member country of the Community.... 
  But so it was.... And it had been planned for a couple of 
weeks, basically proving the fact that the return of neofascist 
ministers to the government has perhaps prompted more fear 
abroad than it has between Palermo and Milan. 
  In an evening that suddenly grew very heated, Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro was not the only one drafting replies. Carlo 
Scognamiglio, the new speaker of the Senate and a Berlusconi 
supporter, also issued a protest. He wrote to Egon Klepsch, 
president of the European Parliament. And he did not pull his 
punches: "While respecting the prerogatives of the European 
Parliament, I believe that the prerogatives of national 
parliaments deserve equal respect.... I express my opposition 
to a position that seems to reflect an intention to ignore the 
expression of the Italian people's will and the exercise of 
national sovereignty.... The Italian people and their 
democratically elected legislative assemblies are, and will 
remain, the only judges of matters concerning national 
sovereignty." 
<H5>  Berlusconi: No Comment </H5>
  What about Berlusconi? What did the prime minister-designate 
have to say about the "war" declared on him by the European 
Parliament? "No comment. I want to read the text of the motion 
first," he whispered as he entered the umpteenth (and 
inconclusive) majority meeting. And of course, he knew nothing 
about the other "reprisals" planned by the European Socialist 
group: They will vote against any decisions by the Council of 
Ministers to which the "neofascists" may contribute and will 
expel "any member of the group that supported Forza Italia in 
the general election or that supports Berlusconi's or his 
allies' lists in the coming European elections...." This is 
all-out war....

  [Text] Following the European Parliament's approval of a 
motion warning against the appointment of fascist ministers in 
the Italian Government, Strasbourg is now backtracking. Egon 
Klepsch, president of the European Parliament, came out against 
yesterday's vote and has not ruled out the possibility of the 
resolution being cancelled because of the differences in the 
text translated into the various parliamentary languages. 
  The European Parliament president stressed that the 
Parliament did not want to give the impression that Italy is not 
a secure member of the democratic front. He concluded that 
Italy's commitment to democracy was beyond doubt. 
  The motion warning against the inclusion of fascists in the 
government was presented by Jean-Pierre Cot, the French 
president of the Socialist parliamentary group. 
  President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro yesterday sent a letter of 
protest to the Parliament condemning the vote. Irene Pivetti 
and Carlo Scognamiglio, the speakers of the Chamber of Deputies 
and the Senate, sent letters today.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by Andreas </F>
Unterberger; place and date not given: "Alois Mock: `Net 
Payers Benefit Most From the European Union'"] 
  [Excerpt] [Unterberger] One of the most frequent 
accusations against European Union [EU] membership is that we 
will be net payers and will therefore pay more in than we get 
out. 
  [Mock] As far as I know, Germany is the only founding 
country 
that has been a net payer right from the beginning. However, 
the Germans recognize that they benefit most. I am often asked: 
"If we are net payers now, we will hopefully also be net 
receivers at some time in the future." I always answer to that: 
"Yes, when we are poor." 
  [Unterberger] Why do net payers benefit most? 
  [Mock] The net payers have a very dynamic economy and, 
therefore, they can get the maximum out of the large market. 
  [Unterberger] The Greens say that it will be the end of 
neutrality if we join the EU. 
  [Mock] Of course, this is wrong. Neutrality derives from 
what is set down in our neutrality law. This law is fully 
compatible with the rights and duties that we take over as a 
result of membership. This is the opinion of the government, it 
is the opinion of all experts, with the exception of one, who 
has registered doubts regarding the issue of economic sanctions. 
This is also the view of Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland. 
  [Unterberger] And how will the special problem of economic 
sanctions be solved? 
  [Mock] I am of the view that the issue of sanctions was only 
part of neutrality policy (which is not settled by the 
Constitution -- the editor). Neutrality is reflected in certain 
regulations, from the penal code to the Military Materiel Law. 
  [Unterberger] Thus, these application laws must be amended? 
  [Mock] Yes, either one amends these laws or one clarifies 
matters from a constitutional perspective. However, in case of 
doubt I prefer the former, which means that things would be done 
similarly to what was done in the case of Iraq and Kuwait. 
  [Unterberger] When we permitted overflights on the basis of 
UN decisions in January 1991? 
  [Mock] Yes. 
  [Unterberger] If all goes well, you will sit at a table with 
12 or 15 other ministers on 2 January 1995 What is your 
priority, what are our goals with regard to a common foreign and 
security policy? 
  [Mock] My priority is to contribute to making a common 
foreign and security policy a reality in the first place, 
because the more quickly it is established, the more effective 
it will be. In terms of content, it is certainly the issue of 
the former Yugoslavia that is a priority, where it is important 
to bring about at least a cease-fire. Then there is the issue 
of a coherent policy toward Central and Eastern Europe and of 
partnership with the United States and Canada. These are the 
priorities. 
  Even though it is not a priority, it is also important to 
show through relations with the developing countries that we are 
not just an egotistical association. And then there is, of 
course, the East Asia-Pacific area, which is already a focal 
area in international economic relations. 
  [Unterberger] Will you be able to vote freely in a common 
foreign and security policy and in the EU Council of Foreign 
Ministers, which is the most important body of the EU, or are 
you bound by a mandate from Vienna? 
  [Mock] In my view, if things are not settled differently, I 
am politically responsible to the Austrian parliament, just as I 
am obligated to turn to the Austrian Government, if the matter 
at hand is something that has to be discussed by the government.

<F P=106> [Johan Cuppens commentary: "Lost Honor of the European </F>
Parliament"] 
  [Text] The enlargement of the European Union (EU) to 
include four new member states has come one step closer. For 
yesterday, the European Parliament (EP) gave its approval to the 
accession treaties that had previously been concluded with 
Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria. 
  The voting was preceded by an unprecedented lobbying 
campaign, with all parties mobilizing their members in an effort 
to achieve the required majority. Great effort was invested in 
the lobbying campaign, and EP members (MEPs) were put under 
pressure from various quarters by means of letters bearing the 
signatures of figures ranging from Jean-Luc Dehaene, German 
Chancellor Kohl, and the outgoing Netherlands Prime Minister 
Ruud Lubbers to [Luxembourg] Prime Minister Jacques Santer. 
  In each case the message was unequivocal: The EU cannot 
leave the four applicant countries at a loose end and must "send 
a signal" by means of a positive vote that the newcomers are 
welcome. 
  There is no objection to this attitude. After all, the EU is 
an "open" association of states that any democratic country 
subscribing to its goals can join. Nobody wants to prevent 
enlargement of the club. However, enlargement of this kind does 
become a problem if other conditions are not fulfilled first. 
That is precisely where the shoe pinches, and at that level the 
EP vote can hardly have been welcomed by those who have serious 
intentions regarding a politically unified Europe. 
  There are a great many good arguments in favor of 
enlargement 
that have to be taken into account. The candidate member states 
can all pride themselves on their highly democratic institutions 
and on the fact that these institutions function exceptionally 
well. Moreover, the countries in question share the same culture 
as the 12 existing EU member states. The latter argument can 
also be used for including the countries of Central and Eastern 
Europe. 
  And yet, by deciding as it did, the EP was not true to 
itself 
and did not do Europe a good turn. For the Europe that is about 
to be launched is quite a different Europe than the one for 
which committed Europeans are striving, namely a unified Europe, 
showing solidarity, and a Europe with smoothly functioning 
institutions. 
  Under pressure from pure political considerations, the 
negotiations on accession were hurried through without at the 
same time keeping an eye on the need to adjust the rules of play 
with a view to securing the internal EU functioning. 
  That is precisely where the EP went wrong. In the past, 
Parliament has come out with numerous resolutions and issued 
urgent calls to begin by deepening the Union and only then 
proceeding to enlarge it. But when it came to turning words 
into deeds, the EP cried off. 
  Grim statements, such as voting "with a very heavy heart" in 
favor of enlargement, or "in order to serve higher interests," 
or "in order to show solidarity with the candidate member 
states" all have a false ring about them. Not only do they 
contradict previous, frequently idealistic outpourings, but in 
many instances they also conceal pure opportunism on the part of 
MEPs who are seeking to save their political hide. 
  So, shortly before the European elections (scheduled for 12 
June), Parliament has missed a unique opportunity. Its 
credibility may well have been dealt a fatal blow. The EP has 
lost its honor.

<F P=106> [Michel De Muelenaere commentary: "A Year To Save the </F>
Union"] 
  [Text] Following the approval given by the European 
Parliament (EP) to the expansion of the European Union [EU], an 
examination of conscience is necessary. The debates of recent 
months have left their mark within the Twelve. It is now for 
the advocates of a stronger Europe to resume the initiative. 
  By imposing expansion on their partners, disregarding 
serious 
guarantees for the EU's future, the Germans have seriously 
endangered the unity of the club, and its very existence. For 
Bonn, the membership of Scandinavia and Austria is merely an 
episode determining the future expansion to the East European 
countries, the only expansion which matters. However, the 
survival of a federal Europe will only be assured if a radical 
reform of its functioning is rapidly implemented. Choosing 
urgency, under the impetus of a Germany which is a prey to a 
kind of obsessional delirium, the Twelve have postponed this 
discussion until later, at a time when the unanimity of the 
Sixteen will be even more difficult to achieve. This is a point 
in favor of those who reject a supranational Europe. 
  With his term as European presidency starting on 1 July, 
Helmut Kohl has a golden opportunity to be forgiven for his 
dangerous leap in the dark. After crushing any resistance, and 
vigorously, he must lift his former adversaries up again, the 
advocates of a more integrated Europe and the EP. The latter, 
which is weak, has been humiliated by the governments. It only 
had one choice: To bow and repudiate its beliefs or jeopardize 
expansion. Faced with the states, the EP is a progressive 
protagonist. It must be given the opportunity to influence the 
EU future which will be drawn up at the future 
"intergovernmental conference" in 1996. 
  To the European federalists, Germany must guarantee that a 
16-member Europe can still make progress. It must do so even if 
the future is gloomy, because the forces of stagnation already 
seem to have so much control without it seeming to be possible 
to oust them. 
  In this trial of strength, France has a role to play. 
Divided between the Elysee [president's office] and the Hotel 
Matignon [prime minister's office], too content to see 
Parliament receive a snub, affected by the anti-European 
sentiments of a section of its majority, the French Government 
has backed down completely in face of its German partner. 
  Henceforth, the duo holds the Union's future in its hands. 
It must adjust its aim. The Germans, forced to do so out of a 
guilty conscience, are thinking of this. Paris must support 
them. The German and French presidencies will follow each 
other: This is a year for saving the Union. 
  The third big absentee from the debate was Belgium. A 
traditional rampart against the EU going off-course, it was not 
able to make Germany see reason. Did it really try to do so? 
Why did Belgium agree to open the negotiations on expansion 
without having obtained minimal assurances on the Union's 
future? How were the Belgians able to accept that the 1996 
intergovernmental conference should take place in such 
inauspicious circumstances? 
  The desire to defend the position of the small countries 
does 
not explain everything. It is a rearguard battle: Sooner or 
later the balance between big and small countries will have to 
be reviewed at the latter's expense. Fearing that it would lose 
out, Belgium did not insist on reform. A strategic error. 
  Of course the pragmatism of Dehaene and Claes did wonders in 
establishing the seats of the European institutions, concluding 
the GATT negotiations, and so forth. But in the debate on 
expansion, a more decisive presence was needed. Belgium failed. 
It must express its ideas!

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Brinkman Has Sleepless Night -- </F>
Purple Coalition Near"] 
  [Text] CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] leader Brinkman 
seriously considered resigning after the heavy election defeat 
of his party. "I had a sleepless night about it," he admitted 
yesterday. In the end, he decided to stay and yesterday 
afternoon received the support of his parliamentary party, which 
elected him to be its chairman. Yesterday, after the first 
meeting of the new, much reduced parliamentary party, Brinkman 
did not want to go into the question of what sort of cabinet 
should emerge, in the view of the CDA. 
  According to sources in the CDA, the parliamentary party 
feels that the two big winners in the election, the D66 
[Democrats 66] and the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy], must be the first ones to investigate which parties 
could work together in a new cabinet. The VVD is also thinking 
along these lines. PvdA [Labor Party] leader Kok did not want 
to make any comment about the "color" of the new cabinet. In 
his view, it was obvious that the "biggest party and the biggest 
winner in the elections," respectively his party and the D66, 
should form the basis for the new cabinet. 
<H5>  Kok: Tempo Behind Formation </H5>
  "The `color' of the coalition is very important," Kok said. 
"But the key question is: With which parties we can make the 
best agreements on the basis of our program." The PvdA leader 
said it was "dangerous to first express a preference for parties 
and only then see whether you can agree." 
  According to the PvdA, the formation process should be 
completed as quickly as possible. "We must join speed with 
carefulness, otherwise 1995 will be a year lacking in policies," 
Kok said. Despite differences over program with other parties, 
Kok appeared reasonably optimistic. "Of course, there are 
complications and a willing attitude is needed to reach 
compromises, but I am positive in the main," he said. 
  Kok did not want to answer the question of whether it was 
necessary to appoint someone to investigate whether a coalition 
could be achieved, or appoint someone to actually form a 
cabinet. He is to advise Queen Beatrix on this issue tomorrow. 
"It seems more sensible to me that Her Majesty is the first 
person to hear that from me," he said. 
  Outgoing minister Van Thijn, who is not a member of the PvdA 
parliamentary party, found it hard to imagine that the current 
coalition partners, the CDA and PvdA, could both continue to 
govern in the new cabinet. "It would be very strange if the 
present coalition came out of the formation process a winner," 
he said. "It is obvious that one of the two will give way in 
the cabinet formation process." Van Thijn made his comments in 
an interview with ELSEVIER magazine about the election results. 
  Van Thijn regarded a "purple" coalition comprising the PvdA, 
the VVD, and the D66 as closer than ever, all the more so given 
the CDA's campaign style. "The CDA set up its campaign in a way 
that leaves you cold. They monopolized values and standards," 
Van Thijn said. 
  If it came down to a cabinet comprising the PvdA, the CDA, 
and the D66, then in his view it was not reasonable for 
Brinkman, leader of the CDA parliamentary party, to be part of 
it. "It is not self-evident that Brinkman will take part in a 
progressive majority cabinet," the PvdA politician said. 
  The PvdA parliamentary party elected Kok as its chairman, 
Wallage as first deputy chairman and former parliamentary 
chairman Wltgens as second deputy chairman. 
  The much larger VVD parliamentary party needed little time 
to 
decide on what advice it would give the Queen. It decided to 
leave a free hand to the leader of the parliamentary party, 
Bolkestein. Bolkestein made it clear in the debate of leading 
candidates that in his eyes the CDA/PvdA coalition, supplemented 
by the D66, could not continue to govern. "That would come down 
to a continuation of the policies of the last four years," he 
said. "That is not what the voters want." 
  In the VVD parliamentary party, there have been calls for a 
liberal duo (comprising the VVD and the D66) to be appointed to 
investigate whether a coalition could succeed. But because 
[D66] Van Mierlo's advice is uncertain (the D66 will meet 
today), it was decided to give Bolkestein a free hand. "He will 
act as he sees fit," one member of the parliamentary party said. 
  Yesterday, the CDA parliamentary party started "in an 
oppressed mood" to look into the causes of the heavy election 
defeat. "Criticism was made of those who played a leading role 
in the election campaign," Brinkman said. The parliamentary 
party also came to the conclusion that it would have to take a 
more independent attitude toward the cabinet and give less 
support to the government. The parliamentary party will continue 
its discussions next Wednesday. 
  The CDA executive committee also wants an "in-depth 
analysis" 
of what went wrong. A proposal to this effect will be on the 
agenda of a party executive meeting tomorrow.

Democracy Demands Cabinet Seats After Big Election Gains"] 
  [Text] The VVD [People's Party For Freedom and Democracy] 
is demanding a role in government after its big gain in seats on 
Tuesday [3 May] evening, but its leading candidate Bolkestein 
personally would prefer to continue to lead the parliamentary 
party. Bolkestein rejected a role in the opposition. "We are a

  "The VVD was not set up to be in opposition," the VVD's 
leading candidate said in a nearly euphoric mood at the party 
meeting in Aalsmeer. "We are out to govern." 
  Like other prominent party members, he did not say which 
coalition he would prefer. But like MP Erica Terpstra, second 
candidate on the list, the VVD leader attacked the PvdA [Labor 
Party] and was mild toward D66 [Democrats 66], which in his view 
had "performed terrifically" in doubling its number of seats. 
  MP Dijkstal, the third candidate on the list, said the most 
eye- catching results were those of the CDA [Christian 
Democratic Appeal] and the PvdA, the coalition parties. "It is 
completely clear that another cabinet must be formed and we will 
talk about that from tomorrow onwards," he said. 
  Terpstra regarded the chance of a "purple" coalition 
[consisting of the VVD, the PvdA, and the D66] as "not probable" 
because the PvdA was directly opposed to the VVD in the field of 
social security. Bolkestein emphasized that [PvdA] Kok would 
have to reorientate in that field. He called the position of 
the PvdA leader "eccentric, peculiar." 
  Bolkestein said that after yesterday evening's election 
results, it was in no way certain "that the biggest party would 
also provide the prime minister." "The prime ministership 
cannot be claimed," he said. In the formation process, Kok and 
Brinkman would certainly have to "moderate their tone," the 
VVD's leading candidate said. "The time of the big power blocks 
in politics is past." 
  The VVD achieved its second-best election result in the 
history of the party. "Who would have dared think a year ago 
that the difference with the CDA would only be four seats?" 
Bolkestein said. 
  "The VVD could thank its success to a clear program, in his 
view. For the VVD, more than other parties, it was about 
policies," he said at the meeting in Aalsmeer. 
  After the seats had been divided out, Bolkestein's initial 
analysis was that the present coalition of the CDA and the PvdA 
had "received an incredible beating from the electorate." From 
this it followed that "the Netherlands wants another cabinet 
with different policies." 
  He rigorously rejected speculation that the VVD would prefer 
a strong role in the opposition to a small place in government. 
His party was certainly seeking to participate in government. 
"The electorate expects a cabinet where something will change," 
he said. "That is a cabinet including the VVD." 
  He was angered by suggestions that the CDA and the PvdA 
could 
continue to govern with the addition of the senior citizens' 
parties, for example. "It would be unprecedented if a coalition 
which suffers such big losses is put in a position to continue 
its policies," he said. 
  At first, Bolkestein was silent when asked about his own 
specific political future. However, after some seconds passed 
in the momentarily silent room, he repeated what he had already 
said before the elections: Even after yesterday evening's 
strong gain in seats, Bolkestein will continue to prefer leading 
his parliamentary party.

<F P=106> [Frans Boogaard commentary: "Europe Will Have To Get Used </F>
To Delors Likely Successor"] 
  [Text] The new European Commission (EC) will have to get 
used to it. Instead of a president who sets clear lines, a man 
whose ideas roam widely; instead of a president who grants his 
colleagues a large measure of autonomy, a man who says: "Shall 
I look at this with you?" 
  Yet the differences between the retiring "Mister Europe," 
French Socialist Jacques Delors, and his likely Christian 
Democrat successor Ruud Lubbers are less than they may at first 
appear. 
  Both are able to bring enthusiasm and initiative to their 
task, to bridge differences and, within the limits of their 
office, bring uncooperative ministers or Councils of Ministers 
around to their way of thinking. And both of them want to do 
more than stand at the head of a body which, according to the 
rules, should restrict itself to submitting proposals and 
implementing decisions. 
  They also share a financial and economic background, Delors 
was finance minister, Lubbers was economic minister, and the 
belief that economic growth, partly through lower labor costs 
and technological innovation, is necessary in order to 
effectively combat unemployment and to restore European 
competitive strength. 
  Although Lubbers will be formally nominated for the 
position, 
his public stance is that the Brussels job is not so necessary 
for him and that he would be perfectly content to let it pass to 
any other suitable candidate. 
  In the meantime, Lubbers is already strengthening his 
position six weeks before his candidacy is to be considered by 
European government leaders. Internally, he has made it clear 
that if they are seeking an "administrateur," which has slightly 
derogatory connotations in French, they may do better to 
approach his Belgian colleague Jean-Luc Dehaene. 
  If on the other hand, they want a manager then Lubbers is 
available. In this way too Lubbers, who is 55 on Saturday [7 
May], gives the impression of sharing the same views as Delors, 
who during his 10 years as Commission president was equally 
opposed to the role as figurehead. 
  At a time when Europe suffered from a lack of efficiency, 
Delors produced his famous policy document, which provided for a 
reorganization of European agricultural policy, more funds for 
the Union, and more support for the poorer member states, 
followed two years later by detailed plans for far-reaching 
economic and monetary cooperation. In this way Delors helped to 
ensure that the structural sclerosis threatening the Union was 
transformed before too long into a kind of euphoria. Delors' 
successor is facing a similar challenge, but one both more 
difficult and more complex. 
  Union enlargement to include new member states, the 
institutional reform which this will inevitably bring (more 
working languages, more ministers, more commissioners and more 
members of parliament), the sharp rise in unemployment, 
decreasing commitment to the southern countries, and stagnating 
integration, in the area of asylum policy and monetary and 
economic cooperation for example, all serve to make the word 
"challenge" into much more than the formal pledge which is usual 
when taking office. 
  Time is short for Lubbers. He has already perfected his 
language skills. Lobbying is no longer necessary, as nearly all 
the government leaders already know him very well. But for 
Lubbers too, producing a work programme in less than three 
months which will get the Union back on the rails remains a 
considerable task. 
  Especially as Lubbers in his nearly 12 years as prime 
minister has, at least on paper, formulated few concrete ideas 
on Europe's future, and certainly for someone who is now 
expected to further build upon the rich inheritance of such 
architects of Europe as Schumann, Monnet, and De Gasperi.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Sarah Womack] </F>
  [Text] John Major's grip on the Tory leadership was visibly 
weakened today after a night in which his shattered party 
surrendered some of its prized possessions. 
  Britain's most dramatic local government elections for 
decades became the Conservatives' worst and most humiliating 
showing of all time, as the Liberal Democrats swept to victory 
after victory, with Labour making some surprising gains as well. 
  Conservatives stood by helpless as their power sensationally 
deserted them in some of their most diehard heartlands. Now 
they face a nerve-racking five weeks before the Euro-elections, 
where all the signs point to further setbacks and catastrophes. 
By 6am Labour had made a net gain of four councils, the Liberal 
Democrats had made a net gain of nine councils and the Tories 
had made a net loss of 17 councils. 
  In an astonishing catalogue of misery, the Tories lost 
control of, or failed to capture, a series of authorities which 
for decades have been Tory through and through. These 
included: the flagship Basildon, the Essex seat which epitomises 
Toryism, Epping Forest, Woking, Worthing, Birmingham, 
Stratford-upon-Avon, Southend, Enfield and Croydon -- where they 
have held power for more than a century -- and even Tunbridge 
Wells. 
  Now, the clamour will mount -- possibly irresistibly -- for 
a 
leadership election in the autumn, even though Tory business 
managers will warn dissidents that a challenge will plunge the 
party into even further and possibly irreparable disarray. But 
Michael Portillo, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and the 
choice of the Right to succeed Mr Major, insisted that the 
night's "disappointments" would have the reverse effect and 
rally the party behind the leader. 
  If the pattern of yesterday's voting is repeated at the 
Euro- 
elections, experts have predicted that Labour leader John Smith 
would have 55 of the 86 seats, Mr Major would have 18, and Paddy 
Ashdown 10. Repeated in a general election, today's figures 
would also give Labour a massive 125 overall majority in the 
House of Commons. 
  At the Liberal Democrat headquarters the party celebrated a 
night of triumphs -- flawed only by a blemish at the troubled 
East End Tower Hamlets council, the scene of allegations of 
racist campaigning. And jubilant Labour not only ousted the 
Liberal Democrats from control, but celebrated, too, their 
defeat of the British National Party in the Millwall ward -- 
"the most important ward in Britain tonight", said Frank Dobson, 
Labour's election coordinator. The Liberal Democrat trophies 
included Eastleigh in Hampshire -- where the Tories will soon be 
defending a vital parliamentary by-election. All the signs are 
now that the Conservatives' 17,000-plus majority at the general 
election will be wiped out by Paddy Ashdown's party. Paddy 
Ashdown was in ebullient mood. He told PA News: "The Liberal 
Democrats are the clear winners in these elections. This has 
been a vote of confidence in the Liberal Democrat councils, 
councillors and campaigners." The Liberal Democrat roll of 
triumph is Worthing (from the Conservatives) plus, Bath, 
Colchester, Congleton, Eastleigh, Kingston-upon-Thames, Mole 
Valley, Rochford, St Albans and Winchester, all of which had no 
overall control. 
  The Tory loss of Basildon, where John Major personally 
campaigned, was a bitter blow. But even worse was the failure 
to capture Birmingham from Labour, whose management of the city 
has been pilloried ceaselessly and without mercy by ministers. 
Birmingham was Target Number One on the Tory hit-list. But 
Labour managed to keep control. Labour gained Croydon, Enfield 
and Welwyn Hatfield from the Tories. Croydon was a special 
prize, in that it has been in Tory hands for more than a 
century. And the victory at Enfield is a direct body-blow for 
Michael Portillo, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Tories' 
London election coordinator. But Labour lost control at 
Kirklees, Oldham and Pendle. Even so, John Smith the Opposition 
leader, commented: "This has been a splendid night for Labour. 
"We have achieved far more than could have been expected, in 
particular the stunning victories in Croydon and Enfield, a 
swing to Labour in Birmingham and the destruction of the 
Liberals in Tower Hamlets." 
  Conservative chairman Sir Norman Fowler's assertion that 
they 
would emerge with net gains now has a hollow ring about it. But 
he underlined his view -- shared by Michael Portillo -- that the 
Prime Minister is safe in his job. Mr Portillo said the night's 
"disappointments" meant that the party would rally behind the 
Prime Minister. "These are disappointing mid-term results. 
But we will recover from them. What has happened is that some 
Conservative voters stayed at home. They did not transfer over 
to Labour."

<F P=106> [George Jones report: "Tories `Will Be Positive on Europe'"] </F>
  [Text] The Tories will fight next month's Euro-elections 
on a "positive" manifesto which will make clear that the 
European Union matters to Britain, Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign 
Secretary, disclosed last night. 
  On the eve of today's local elections, he announced that the 
Tory leadership had taken a strategic decision to mount a 
popular Euro-campaign concentrating on "bread and butter issues" 
to rebuild public confidence in the European Union. 
  A letter sent last night by Mr Hurd to the Conservative 
Political Centre, and obtained by The Daily Telegraph, said jobs 
and economic recovery would be the priority of a "distinctive 
and positive" Tory manifesto. 
  "With Britain's performance outstripping that of our 
partners 
on growth, inflation and jobs, we have a good tale to tell," 
said Mr Hurd. 
  Other key themes include the importance of free trade; 
completion of the single market; the drive for competitiveness 
and deregulation; avoidance of unnecessary costs through the 
Social Chapter; and initiatives against red tape, defrauding of 
the EC budget and international crime. 
  Mr Hurd's letter disclosed that the tone of the Tory 
campaign 
will be in marked contrast to the last Euro-elections in 1989, 
when Mrs Thatcher was accused of fighting a "negative" campaign, 
with posters warning people against a "diet of Brussels" and 
attacking the EC Commission. 
  His letter will be seen as a further attempt by the Tory 
leadership to quash demands from the party's Euro-sceptics for 
Britain to consider withdrawing from the EC if there are further 
moves towards creating a federal State. 
  The European elections on June 9 will be a crucial mid-term 
test for Mr Major's Government in the wake of today's local 
council elections . 
  With the Tories running 21 points behind Labour in the 
opinion polls, they fear many disillusioned supporters will stay 
at home, so the party is braced for setbacks. 
  The closing stages of the Tory local elections campaign have 
been over-shadowed by renewed party infighting over the 
Government's stance towards a European single currency. 
  In his letter, Mr Hurd confirmed the manifesto -- due to be 
published in two weeks' time -- will restate the agreed Cabinet 
line that it will be for a future British Parliament to decide 
on a single currency "when and if that decision has ever to be 
taken". 
  Three times in the seven-page letter Mr Hurd emphasised the 
need to fight a positive campaign. 
  He added: "We have taken a strategic decision to do just 
that. Our supporters will only turn out and vote if we persuade 
them that these elections matter because the European Union 
matters to Britain and because the decisions of the European 
Parliament affect us directly." 
  Mr Hurd has been in charge of efforts to draw up a manifesto 
which will unite the party after the damaging divisions over 
Maastricht. He said the Government's objective was to get to an 
open, free trading, decentralised and popular European Union 
which did not undermine the nation state.

<F P=106> [Report by Jon Hibbs and George Jones: "Tories Settle </F>
Euro-Poll Manifesto"] 
  [Text] Cabinet ministers yesterday agreed to sink their 
differences on Europe and approved a manifesto for the June 9 
elections spelling out a "positive," Conservative agenda for a 
decentralised and free-enterprise Community. 
  Euro-sceptic ministers backed away from a confrontation over 
the manifesto when the Cabinet held a "political session," 
without officials present, to discuss preparations for the 
Euro-elections. 
  The manifesto, drawn up by a committee headed by Mr Douglas 
Hurd the Foreign Secretary, has been shortened by about a third 
to give it more political punch. 
  Officials said the central theme was decentralised, 
deregulated open and competitive European Union. It would also 
underline the Government's commitment to maintain Britain's veto 
on EC decisions affecting vital national interests, the two 
opt-outs on the Social Chapter and a single currency. Mr Major 
rejected calls from the Tory Right for the manifesto to be 
recast to give it a more Euro-sceptic tone and has sought to 
maintain a balance which will unite both wings of the party. 
  Although it will not seek to demean EC institutions, it will 
strongly attack the policies of the Labour and Liberal Parties, 
arguing they would lead to an over-regulated federal European 
superstate. The manifesto will be published in about 10 days. 
  Despite the Cabinet's decision to adopt a manifesto which 
argues that the EC and the Euro elections matter to Britain, a 
full-scale Commons debate on Europe on Monday week could 
undermine efforts by ministers to present a united front. 
  The decision by Government business managers to schedule the 
wide-ranging discussion on the European Union only days before 
the launch of the European elections campaign was seen as a 
calculated gamble. But ministers believe it will also be an 
opportunity to call the bluff of critics who fear Britain is not 
taking a tough enough line in resisting the Community's drift 
towards federalism. 
  They want to use the occasion to challenge Labour's 
commitment to a pan-European socialist manifesto which endorses 
an extension of majority voting, effectively giving up Britain's 
national veto. 
  Officially the debate is billed as a routine discussion of 
European issues, in advance of the regular six-monthly summit 
meeting of Community leaders in Corfu next month. 
  It could have been postponed until after the European 
elections, though that would not giye much time for routine 
parliamentary consultation before the heads of government 
meeting on June 23. 
  It would also open the Government to charges of suppressing 
parliamentary scrutiny of European matters to avoid political 
embarrassment. 
  As is customary on an adjournment debate there will be no 
vote, so there is no danger of the Government's majority being 
threatened. 
  Mr Tony Newton, Leader of the House, also announced 
yesterday 
that MPs will examine the arrangements admitting Austria, 
Finland Norway and Sweden to an enlarged Community, just 
approved by the European Parliament, in a Commons standing 
committee next week. 
  In the long term, primary legislation will be required, 
probably in the next session of Parliament, to amend the 
treaties governing Britain's membership to take account of their 
accession.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Gerry Adams Allowed To Fight Mainland Ban"] </F>
  [Text] Sinn Fein's president, Mr Gerry Adams' won 
permission yesterday to challenge the Government's exclusion 
order banning him from mainland Britain . 
  Mr Justice Potts gave his lawyers leave to seek a judicial 
review, saying there was "an arguable case". 
  But the judge added: "You will appreciate the result may 
well 
be that you succeed -- equally it may well be that you fail." 
  With the pressure group Liberty acting as his solicitors, Mr 
Adams is seeking to overturn the exclusion order made against 
him last October under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989. 
  He will also challenge the legality, under European and 
domestic law, of the subsequent decision by Mr Michael Howard, 
the Home Secretary, not to revoke the order in January. 
  Yesterday's application for a review was unopposed by Mr 
Howard. 
  The judge ordered an urgent hearing of the case because of 
the "points of public importance" raised. 
  Mr Robin Allen, appearing for Mr Adams, told the court that 
the Sinn Fein leader only wanted to pay a brief visit to England 
to discuss the political situation in Ulster with MPs, at the 
invitation of Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP. Mr Allen accused Mr 
Howard of "taking a sledgehammer to crack a small nut". 
  Mr Adams was first excluded from mainland Britain under an 
order made in 1982. It was lifted the following year when he 
was elected MP for West Belfast but reimposed last year after an 
election defeat. 
  The Government action was illegal, Mr Allen argued, under 
European laws which guaranteed citizens freedom of movement and 
freedom of expression. 
  The case marked the first time the English courts had had to 
deal with the concept of European Union citizenship, which had 
come in for criticism in the country because it created a kind 
of federalism and "a citizenship which transcends national 
citizenship". 
  As an Irish national, and therefore a citizen of a European 
member state' Mr Adams had the right to move freely within the 
UK, unless restrictions were properly authorised under the 
Treaty of Rome, as amended by the Maastricht Treaty. There were 
no such restrictions, Mr Allen said. 
  The European citizen's rights enjoyed by Mr Adams were in a 
"superior class" and "trumped" the Home Secretary's right to 
make orders under the domestic anti-terrorism laws. 
  At the heart of the case was the question of freedom of 
expression. 
  All Mr Adams wanted to do was to attend a meeting at a date 
to be fixed at the Houses of Parliament to discuss the political 
situation in Northern Ireland. 
  "Mr Adams says that however much he may be reviled by 
politicians in this country he is a person who ought to have the 
right to freedom of expression under Community law." 
  The Home Secretary had in the past allowed persons subject 
to 
exclusion orders to attend court and give evidence in England. 
  "Just as evidence in a court is an essential part of the 
democratic process, engaging in political dialogue in one 
meeting is also an essential and important part of the political 
and democratic process," Mr Allen said. 
  He said there was also a possibility of the case being 
referred to the European Court of Justice, which would add a 
two-year delay to the judicial process. 
  A Downing Street spokesman said later: "The Government's 
policy has not changed at all. We will have to see how the 
process of the judicial review comes out."

    [Editorial Report] In light of the anniversary of the 25 
April 1974 revolution, the Lisbon weekly VISAO published the 
results of a 1994 Marktest poll (no further information) on the 
Portuguese people's view of the revolution and its goals, 
comparing it with the results obtained in a similar 1984 poll. 
  In 1984, 33.4 percent of the respondents thought they had 
realized their personal goals, while 67.3 percent think so 
today. While 28.1 percent thought then that they had realized 
their professional goals, the percentage has increased to 57.2 
percent. In 1984, 20.7 percent thought their economic situation 
had improved, but 56.2 percent presently think so. 
  Portugal's course since the revolution was assessed as 
follows:

  Respondents were also asked how they view the revolution's 
nationalizations. In 1984, 52.9 percent agreed with them, versus 
37.9 percent today. Those who did not agree in 1984 (32.5 
percent) increased to 49.3 percent, while 14.7 percent and 12.8 
percent had no opinion in 1984 and 1994 respectively. 
  The 1994 poll also asked respondents how they view European 
integration. A large majority (72.3 percent) agree with it, 
while 14.9 percent do not, and 12.8 percent have no opinion. 
However, results showed that the public would have preferred 
that a referendum take place: 76.1 percent said so and 13.0 
percent disagreed, while 10.9 percent had no opinion.

  [Text] The United States can transport uranium from the 
nuclear arms plants of the former Soviet Union across Finland. 
The Council of State has granted a lower responsibility in the 
event of accidents with regard to the transportation of 
low-level uranium. The decision was made because of plans by a 
U.S. company to import diluted uranium extracted from nuclear 
arms to the United States to be used as fuel in nuclear power 
plants. 
  The uranium is transported by cargo ships, which can now 
visit Finnish harbors to collect cargo.

<F P=106> [Bjorn Lindahl report: "Carl I. Hagen's Party Splits"] </F>
  [Text] Oslo -- Norway's Progress Party split yesterday. 
Three of the party's Storting deputies left the party. Another 
deputy had already gone his own way and the party deputy 
chairman had already resigned. 
  This means that party leader Carl I. Hagen will have a 
Storting group of only six deputies, while the four breakaways 
will start to work together. 
  Compared with New Democracy in Sweden where the party's 
founders disappeared and women took over, the reverse is the 
case in Norway. Carl I. Hagen, who has been party leader for 16 
years, has kicked the women and all the opposition to him out of 
the party leadership. He is now being referred to as the "party 
owner" in the Norwegian press and has returned to the populism 
that characterized the party in the 1989 election when his party 
become Norway's third largest and had 22 Storting deputies. 
  It was after this formidable success that Hagen believed 
that 
he could build up a more serious party. Young people who had 
been attracted into the party because of the radical change it 
represented enjoyed rapid careers. However, it turned out that 
they had views that could not automatically be reconciled with 
those of the older populists in the party: They were in favor 
of free immigration, Norwegian EU [European Union] membership, 
and the right for homosexuals to marry. 
  The conflict came to a head at the party congress in 
mid-April. Deputy chairman Ellen Wibe resigned when Carl I. 
Hagen proposed that the congress should not reach a decision on 
Norwegian membership in the EU. However, it was Hagen who won 
over the majority of delegates and who demanded blind obedience. 
  "The walls of the party closed in so much that they made it 
very difficult to breathe. If we had not resigned voluntarily, 
we would have been thrown out," said Ellen Christiansen, one of 
the Storting deputies who has now quit the Progress Party, which 
notched up 5 percent of voter sympathies in the most recent 
opinion poll.

<F P=106> [Ewa Thibaud report: "Sweden Cannot Count on Opt-Outs"] </F>
  [Text] Madrid -- Sweden's neutrality belongs to the past. 
The Swedes must realize this. So said Spanish European Affairs 
Minister Carlos Westendorp on the subject of Swedish admission 
to the EU [European Union]. He also said that Sweden cannot 
remain outside a common currency. 
  "If Sweden were to want to remain outside, there would be 
legal problems. It is only Denmark and Great Britain that have 
opt-outs that give them the right to remain outside." 
  The Spaniards were very active participants in the most 
recent round of membership negotiations, particularly toward the 
end, when the issue was Norway and fish. They had their own 
protracted negotiations in the eighties fresh in their memories. 
And many Spaniards thought that those countries now seeking 
membership achieved much better terms than they achieved 
themselves. 
  In the Spanish press it was often possible to read sentences 
like: "The Swedes are negotiating as if the EU wants to become 
a member of Sweden and not the other way round." In Sweden on 
the other hand the Spaniards' attitude was taken to mean that 
they did not want the Swedes as members of the EU. 
  "Of course we do," Carlos Westendorp said. "Above all 
because Sweden has the right to become a member. But also 
because the level of intellectuals, businessmen, and politicians 
is high in Sweden. 
  ``No, I am not afraid that the Nordic area will have too 
much 
weight in the EU context. The center of gravity will move 
northward, but this is a fact; there is nothing to be done about 
it. The EU cannot be enlarged to the south.'' 
  He could not be expected to say anything else. Nor does the 
opposition say anything else. But Isobel Tocino, the 
conservative People's Party EU spokesman, gave a slightly more 
open display of Spanish concern. She is fond of talking about 
the "European troika" and refers here to Germany, France, and 
Spain. 
  "From Germany and France we have received promises that the 
Mediterranean region will not be forgotten," she said. "We 
border on Africa, and the instability that could come from 
there." 
  I was told several times in my conversations in Madrid that 
Germany, France, and Spain are the major countries. It was also 
repeated several times that the applicant countries together 
have fewer inhabitants than Spain. 
  Spain is also a major recipient of EU support. Twice as much 
money goes to Spain as goes to Italy or Greece. Much of the EU 
money goes to infrastructure. There is a frenetic building of 
roads throughout Spain, and the impression is gotten of a 
country that is much more prosperous than it really is. The EU 
money that goes to individual companies is only a small 
percentage of all the EU money. And businessmen are not 
particularly happy. 
  Least happy were the Spanish fishermen who were unable to 
understand why the Norwegians should be given better terms than 
they had been given. Now the Spanish Government is relatively 
content with the final agreement. But the fishermen are not 
content, and their discontent is not directed against Norway 
alone. An "anchovy war" is currently taking place between French 
and Spanish fishermen. 
  "On the fisheries issue we were defending national 
interests, 
but apart from that we have the whole time pushed common EU 
interests," Isabel Tocino said. She was referring here to the 
agreement in Greece on how many votes are needed to reach 
decisions after the EU is enlarged. Here Spain and Britain were 
the two driving forces. Recalcitrant countries, some said. 
  As far as Sweden's admission is concerned, it was chiefly a 
phasing-in of dues payments that the Spaniards could not accept. 
Nor could they accept that Sweden's regions would receive as 
much support money as impoverished Spanish regions. But the 
compromises that were cobbled together have satisfied the 
Spaniards, for the time being at least. 
  What worries the Spaniards is that Sweden agrees to raising 
environmental standards. Although Carlos Westendorp said that 
it is not Swedish environmental policy that could cause problems. 
  "Sweden and Norway have developed without destroying their 
environment. What we cannot accept is that Germany and Denmark 
want to limit our ability to develop when, at the same time, 
they have destroyed the environment in their own countries. 
They say that we cannot build roads because some particular 
sort of animal must be saved. All right, but in Germany and 
Denmark they have killed all those animals. Now they have to 
give us a chance to develop. 
  ``What worries us is when people use the environment as a 
pretext to prevent free trade. As when Germany demands that we 
should clean up our water, and the equipment is only sold by 
German companies.'' 
  Carlos Westendorp is convinced that the Swedes will vote in 
favor of membership in the EU. But he thinks that a national 
debate is needed in Sweden. 
  "There is a need for a pause for thought, a little time. But 
soon you will have to make up your minds about whether or not 
you want joint defenses. Joint defenses are probably much 
cheaper than retaining neutrality." 
  As far as a common currency is concerned, the Spanish 
Government and opposition are in complete agreement. Nobody 
really wants to start planning for it yet, but both view it as a 
natural development. Isabel Tocino sees no possibility for 
Sweden to preserve its neutrality in the event of membership. 
  "Before we ratify the agreement we must look at the Swedish 
attitude. I reiterate that there is no room for neutrality if 
you want to create a union. A country cannot stay outside and 
think that it can do what it thinks is most comfortable. When 
you join a union you have to accept and live by its rules."

  Replying to reporters' questions, Aliyev said that the 
Partnership for Peace plan signed by NATO member countries in 
Brussels will be very beneficial for the countries that have 
joined the partnership. He added that the partnership 
principles will make significant contributions to the solution 
of the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict.

  [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev stopped over in 
Ankara for contacts on his way to his country from Brussels. He 
was received at Ankara Esenboga Airport by Foreign Minister 
Hikmet Cetin and other officials. Aliyev was taken from the 
airport to the Cankaya Mansion by helicopter where he was 
received by President Suleyman Demirel. 
  Demirel and Aliyev first met alone. Then they continued with 
their meeting over dinner. Present at the dinner were Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller, Chief of the General Staff General Dogan 
Gures, State Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Murat 
Karayalcin, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, Azerbaijani First 
Deputy Prime Minister (Fuat Kuliyev), Foreign Minister Gasan 
Gasanov, and (Vefa Kuluzade), presidential under secretary for 
foreign policy. 
  According to a statement issued by the Presidential Press 
Center, the two presidents held a comprehensive exchange of 
views on all aspects of the bilateral relations and on regional 
problems. Demirel stressed the importance Turkey attaches to the 
protection of Azerbaijan's independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity. He pointed out that the Armenian attacks 
on Azerbaijan are gaining the character of damaging to regional 
stability. He added that the attacks must be stopped, and the 
Armenian occupation of Azeri land and the suffering of the 
people must end as soon as possible. Demirel stated that Turkey 
will continue to support Azerbaijan's justified demands in the 
efforts to resolve the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict within the 
framework of the CSCE-Minsk process. 
  Demirel stressed that Turkey will continue to support the 
friendly and brotherly Azerbaijani people with all its means in 
order to end their suffering and to support their process of 
restructuring as a modern democratic state. 
  The presidents pointed out that such visits are very 
beneficial in that the consultations between the two brotherly 
countries are held at the highest level. 
  Before he left Ankara for Azerbaijan, President Aliyev held 
a 
news conference at Esenboga Airport. He said that faced with 
Armenian occupation, Azerbaijan needs Turkey's support and help 
more than ever before. 
  He pointed out that during his talks with President Demirel, 
they discussed the measures that must be taken to accelerate the 
implementation of the bilateral agreements signed in the past. 
Aliyev went on to say that the friendship between the two 
countries is of great importance for the future and that they 
aim at further developing their relations. 
  Aliyev recalled that he signed the Partnership for Peace 
program in Brussels. In this way, he said, we can take more 
effective measures to save Azerbaijan from Armenian occupation. 
  Aliyev and his delegation were seen off by Foreign Minister 
Cetin. 
  Meanwhile, replying to questions by an Azerbaijani 
television 
correspondent at the Cankaya Mansion, Prime Minister Ciller 
stated that Turkey and Azerbaijan are very close. She pointed 
out that a stability program is being implemented in Turkey, 
adding: This will open the paths before us, and we will begin 
to see the results slowly in the coming days. We will share the 
fruits of this program together with our Azerbaijani brothers. 
  Replying to another question, Ciller said that the Armenian 
attacks are unlawful. We strongly condemn them, she said, 
adding that Turkey is always on the side of Azerbaijan, and 
always helping it. 
  Ciller went on to say that Turkey explains and will continue 
to explain Azerbaijan's just cause in international platforms 
and everywhere.

  [Text] Turkey has announced that the agreement signed 
between Israel and Palestine opens a new page in the Middle East

handing over of Gaza and Jericho to the autonomous Palestinian 
administration, and that it congratulates the Israeli and 
Palestinian leadership who achieved this stage with their 
determined and steadfast policies. 
  The statement then says: Turkey is also pleased with the 
contributions of the United States and the Russian Federation -- 
the cosponsors of the peace process who made effective mediation 
efforts to eliminate the various difficulties that arose during 
the peace full. Also, the efforts of the friendly and brotherly 
Arab Republic of Egypt, and of its honorable president, Mr. 
Mubarak, will always be remembered with admiration. Turkey, 
which has always made every effort to ensure peace and stability 
in the region, will continue to contribute to the peace process

  [Text] Ankara--It has been ascertained that Britain 
supplies military equipment to south Cyprus. It has been 
established that two British C-130 transport aircraft carried a 
cargo of military supplies to south Cyprus in April. It is 
feared that a certain quantity of "arms and ammunition" were 
among the military supplies. 
  One of the planes was obstructed by the Turkish military 
aircraft after it delivered its cargo. It was forced by Turkish 
F-4 fighters to leave Turkey's airspace while returning to 
Britain. Officials have said that Britain has not lodged a 
protest because it does not wish the incident to be disclosed. 
According to the intelligence units, two British C-130's landed 
at the military air base in south Cyprus in April. Intelligence 
units said that Britain may have instructed them to fly to south 
Cyprus under the pretense of transporting military supplies to 
the British bases. 
  One of the aircraft, which has flown to south Cyprus on 
various days, was intercepted by the Turkish military aircraft 
in Turkey's airspace while it was returning to Britain. Several 
F-4 aircraft of the 1st Tactical Air Force Command in Eskisehir 
identified the transport plane close to Dalaman. They then 
forced it to exit Turkish airspace. The British plane left 
Turkey's airspace and landed in Greece. It has been ascertained 
that it has since flown back to Britain.

  [Text] Ankara, May 5 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin returned home on Wednesday [4 May] after taking part in 
the signature ceremony in Cairo giving self-rule to Palestinians 
in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  After his return, Cetin evaluated the removal of the German 
arms ban on Turkey as a normal consequence of Turkish-German 
relations. 
  Germany which suspended arms shipments to Turkey in April, 
on 
claims that these weapons were used in the southeast against 
separatist terrorists, declared the same day that the ban was 
lifted, since the allegations proved to be false. 
  `The decision is proof that efforts to damage German-Turkish 
friendship and cooperation have failed,' Cetin said. 
  `The traditional mutual-trust relations between Turkey and 
Germany have been strengthened once more, after this 
experience,' he said.

  [Text] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz has 
declared that the German Bundestag decision to find a political 
solution for the terrorism in southeast Anatolia is unbecoming 
of the good relations between the two countries. 
  Yilmaz received Hans Stercken, chairman of the Bundestag 
Foreign Affairs Committee, at parliament today. In a statement 
during the meeting, Yilmaz said that this decision by the German 
parliament offends Turkey. It is regrettable that Turkey's 
friends in the Bundestag did not exert efforts to block this 
decision, Yilmaz remarked. He added: Such a decision does not 
conform with the friendly relations between the two countries. 
The fact that this decision will not result in any action does 
not erase its poisoning effect on bilateral relations. 
  The ANAP leader said that he expects Turkey's friends in the 
German parliament to undertake initiatives to rectify this wrong 
decision. He also expressed the hope that Turkish-German 
relations will be raised to their previous level and be purged 
of such errors in the coming period.

  [Text] Zakho -- It is being reported that the Turkish 
Army's operation into South Kurdistan [Iraq], which began 16 
days ago, has failed and one of the units involved in the 
operation has been withdrawn. However, the air-supported 
operation, in which village guards and special teams have also 
taken part alongside tens of thousands of troops, is continuing 
in some places. It is being indicated that the military 
officials, who told the press that they will stay on 
particularly in Mezi and Shive districts of Haftanin region 
until autumn, are only satisfied with the performance of some 
mobile units in the region but that even these units are unable 
to hold their ground. 
  Newspapers published in South Kurdistan report that unlike 
last year's cross-border operation, which at the time was 
described as "the Southern War," none of the peshmerga forces 
have joined the operation launched by the Turkish Army on 12 
April with the aim of creating a "buffer zone." 
  We heard that during the operation--which was given wide 
coverage by the Turkish press, who call it the "Spring 
Operation"--the units were frequently ambushed by the 
guerrillas. There are reports that ARGK [People's Liberation 
Army of Kurdistan] guerrillas have downed a warplane and a 
helicopter in the last 15 days. 
  Intensive clashes took place during the first days of the 
operation in areas of Zap region close to Hakkari's Cukurca 
district. One guerrilla was killed and two other were injured 
during clashes here. The guerrilla sources said that the state 
[Turkish] forces lost many men here and that the guerrillas 
downed a helicopter while it was landing troops. 
  On the same day, eight warplanes raided South Kurdistan's 
Haftanin, Ava Guze, Kela Spi, and Bizenin regions. The 
guerrilla sources reported that they suffered no losses and in 
return downed one of the planes. In its 25 April issue TERCUMAN 
reported the downing of the plane thus: "During the 
cross-border operation one of our F-104 planes hit Gabar 
Mountain and crashed after having blown up a PKK [Workers Party 
of Kurdistan] ammunitions dump." 
<H5>  Clash With the DPK [Democratic Party of Kurdistan] </H5>
  The state forces that established themselves in Berwari 
region on 17 April wanted to infiltrate Mesina Mountain where 
ARGK guerrillas are active, but peshmerga forces prevented them 
from doing so. A clash ensued between the peshmrerga and state 
forces the next day. It is reported that some 20 peshmerga died 
in the clash, and that a 40,000-strong Turkish force moved into 
Zakho's Berwari district and into the rural areas around the 
villages of Shile, Zergal, Kanimasi. When this happened, DPK 
Politburo member Nechirvan Barzani went to Zakho's Amadiye 
district on 20 April. 
  Kanimasi town in Berwari district was bombed by warplanes on 
17 April. Two people, one 65 and the other 9, were injured in 
the raid and taken to Azadi hospital in Zakho. Sinet region was 
also bombed the same day. Welat Sen, 4, was injured and Nahile 
Sen, 15, was killed during the raid. They had moved to south 
Kurdistan after being forced out of Siris village in Sirnak's 
Uludere district. Qesrok Plain and its caves, where 150 families 
from the north [Turkey] had taken shelter, were bombed 
especially severely. Many civilians were injured. 
  Local sources in Cukurca indicated that on the eighth day of 
the operation, ambulances, military vehicles, and helicopters 
started ferrying injured soldiers to Hakkari twice or three 
times a day. The 200-bed military hospital in Hakkari was soon 
full. 
<H5>  Withdrawal </H5>
  Relying on guerrilla sources, KURD-A reports that the 
guerrillas organized five separate attacks on the Turkish Army 
units that were withdrawing from South Kurdistan's Miroz, 
Avashin, and Birchela regions, which are close to Cukurca 
district. It reported that ten soldiers were killed and one 
guerrilla was injured. The state forces who failed to hold on 
to the village of Mavresh withdrew leaving behind its hardware. 
  The valley between Avashin and Herki was bombed for two 
hours 
by the Turkish planes. Troops also landed there. Indicating 
that the landing of troops there creates the possibility that 
the state forces might move eastward, the ARGK press bureau 
said: "Unable to hold their position in a given region, the 
Turkish forces are trying to break through our defenses in some 
other regions. They are suffering losses with each attack and 
are withdrawing. The guerrillas are on alert. The Turkish Army 
has bogged down in south Kurdistan." 
  It is being reported that the regions where the army units 
are withdrawing, specially Avashin and Miroz, are being bombed. 
  In the meantime, it is reported that additional troops are 
being moved from Tatvan to Hakkari. 
<H5>  Clash Between DPK-PUK </H5>
  Another clash has taken place between the DPK and the PUK 
[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan] in South Kurdistan, which is at 
the center of world attention due to the latest operation. An 
hour-long hand-to-hand battle took place in Khelilkan, 
al-Sulaymaniyah at around 1400 on 24 April. Three DPK 
peshmergas died during the clash, which began for unknown 
reasons. It is being reported that there is considerable 
tension between the two organizations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ercan Kanar, president of the Istanbul Human </F>
Rights Association, by Dirk C. Fleck; place and date not given: 
"Torture Is an Everyday Occurrence in Police Life"] 
  [Text] [Fleck] Mr. Kanar, is Turkey a state that uses 
torture? 
  [Kanar] Torture is an everyday occurrence in police life. 
Torture is used in every interrogation. The problem is only to 
prove it. The IHD [Istanbul Human Rights Association] knows of 
500 cases that occurred in 1993 in Istanbul alone. These 
instances of torture were confirmed by doctors. 
  [Fleck] How is torture done? 
  [Kanar] By electrical shocks, hanging, blows to the soles of 
one's feet and genitals, treatment with ice water. The clothes 
of the prisoners are removed and ice water is poured over the 
people. Ice water also makes the swelling from the blows go down. 
  [Fleck] How many of the tortured prisoners come to you? 
What can you do to help? 
  [Kanar] The people who are tortured are told in prison that 
they must fear for their lives if they go to a lawyer. If 
someone still has the courage to do so, we inform the 
international human rights organizations and try to take the 
matter to court. The cases that we know about do not tell 
anything about the reality in our prisons. It is extremely 
difficult to get a certificate from a doctor, particularly for 
people who are detained for political reasons. According to the 
law, they may be taken to a doctor only after 15 days. Usually, 
they are tortured during the first three days. When the doctor 
comes, the wounds have mostly healed. The real rate of torture 
in Istanbul is probably something like 5,000 cases a year. 
  [Fleck] What are the difficulties that you yourself have to 
fear? 
  [Kanar] My colleagues and I are under constant observation, 
our offices are searched arbitrarily by police, any step that we 
take is watched, our telephones are bugged. Over the past two 
years, eight IHD members were killed. Again and again our 
lawyers are imprisoned and detained for up to three months -- 
and that during pending lawsuits. 
  [Fleck] What will happen to the Kurds, who are waiting for 
deportation in Germany, as soon as they return to Turkey? 
  [Kanar] Kurds, in particular, are in extreme danger in our 
country. Any Kurd who is deported from a country of the 
European Union ends up in prison first. Anyone who is known to 
the police as someone who demonstrated for democracy and human 
rights abroad will almost certainly be subjected to heavy 
torture. The countries of the European Union know that, but 
obviously they are applying a double standard to human rights 
issues.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem </F>
Sanberk by Mehmet Ali Kislali; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Kislali] Why is pressure 
being applied with regard to Cyprus? Why are the United States 
and the United Nations pressuring Turkey as though there were no 
other problems in the world? 
  [Sanberk] We ask ourselves the same question. Why? There 
is no bloodshed in Cyprus. No genocide. No threat. I believe 
that there is immense pressure on the part of the Greek lobby in 
the United States. The U.S. Administration has influence in the 
United Nations. Moreover, the United States believes that there 
is now an opportunity to solve this problem. The 
confidence-building measures package is on the table. 
  [Kislali] But this package has not retained its original 
form. It was altered greatly, in line with the Greek Cypriot 
stand. 
  [Sanberk] Yes, it was changed significantly. It is not 
acceptable as it stands today. 
  [Kislali] How do you assess Russia's attitude? Its policy 
appears to have changed. The Russians began intervening in the 
Caucasus. Do they not constitute a source of concern? 
  [Sanberk] Yes, I believe so. On one hand, we are following 
the developments with concern, but on the other hand, we are 
keeping the communications channels with the highest-level 
administrators, such as Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, open. These 
people are exerting great efforts to institute reforms in 
Russia. This is actually an impossible mission. The Russians 
are undertaking a military presence in southern Europe for the 
first time since World War II. 
  [Kislali] Is the fact that they came to Bosnia not an issue 
as well? 
  [Sanberk] In the wake of NATO's ultimatum to the Serbs in 
Bosnia, the Russians made a very clever move and transferred 400 
troops to Bosnia in order to keep the peace. This military 
presence naturally accords them a political image as well. They 
wield great influence over the Serbs there. Considering the 
situation during Tito's reign, the presence of Russian troops in 
Bosnia is a very new phenomenon. If we also take Russia's 
presence in Georgia into consideration and add Ukraine and 
Bulgaria to the Russian sphere, then Turkey finds itself facing 
a crescent. 
  [Kislali] Is this a development Turkey should take into 
consideration? 
  [Sanberk] Given the ambiguity in Europe and Ukraine's 
situation, I would say yes. Furthermore, the United States is 
distancing itself, and NATO is not the same as before. 
Therefore, we are concerned. We also view the future of the 
Russian Federation as unsure. The Russians also have three 
categories of problems. Their economic problems are impossible 
to solve, because they are unable to obtain the necessary funds 
to support their stability programs and resolve the immense 
problems. They want to carry out the economic reforms and 
establish democratic institutions, but this is not easy. They 
also have the problem of nationalities. Therefore, we are not 
very optimistic that the Russian Government will succeed in 
implementing the reforms. 
  [Kislali] What can we expect in Russia? 
  [Sanberk] They must hold elections. Will they turn into a 
nation-state in the aftermath of an empire or will they pursue a 
policy of restoring the empire? For the time being, they do not 
know which borders end where and who should be considered a 
Russian. Therefore, not only we but countries like Estonia and 
Lithuania are also concerned about Russia. As a matter of fact, 
Germany is also concerned about Russia's future moves. 
  [Kislali] What is this concern based on? 
  [Sanberk] An empire cannot be a democratic state, and a 
nondemocratic country cannot implement reforms. Under the 
current circumstances, not all the support given to Yeltsin is 
going toward democracy, although this was the main reason for 
the support. 
  [Kislali] Turkey's view is probably being conveyed to our 
Western allies, for example to the United States. Their views 
are different, are they not? 
  [Sanberk] Yes, our views are conveyed to them. Developments 
are taking place in U.S. foreign policy. We discussed this with 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott last year. Many things 
have happened since then. During the crisis, the vulnerability 
of the Russian parliamentary system was seen. 
  [Kislali] And if you look at the situation from our 
viewpoint? 
  [Sanberk] From our viewpoint, a chaotic Russia would be to 
our disadvantage. Like a vacuum around us. What we want to do 
is to help Russia's democratization and economic reforms. 
However, we have economic problems too. Despite that, we 
extended a loan of $1.2 billion to Russia. Of that, they have 
used $700 million. Our volume of trade is $1.5 billion. There 
are Turkish contractors there, both in the Russian Federation 
and in other republics. 
  [Kislali] What are the latest contracting figures? 
  [Sanberk] We have investments of $2.5 billion in Russia, 
$500 million in Azerbaijan, $430 million in Kazakhstan, $440 
million in Uzbekistan, $180 million in Kyrgyzstan, and $187 
million in Turkestan, even though we do not have political 
relations with it. Turkmenistan is the most important of all; we 
have investments worth $1.2 billion there. These figures make 
up 7 percent of the world's construction investments. 
  [Kislali] Are these activities very important for Turkey? 
  [Sanberk] Of course, because the contractors use Turkish 
workers in these projects. They establish solidarity with the 
peoples of those countries. Our total investments in the 
Russian Federation and the Central Asian republics exceed $5 
billion. 
  [Kislali] Where does the Black Sea Economic Cooperation 
project stand? 
  [Sanberk] It is not as ambitious about forming an 
organization as the Common Market or the European Free Trade 
Association. For the obstacles to be overcome, the states must 
cooperate. Efforts must be made to facilitate investments among 
the member countries. Trade must be made easier. Medium-size 
entrepreneurs must be encouraged. The necessary institutions 
have been set up. The chairman must be Russian. We are waiting 
for that. It will take time. [passage omitted] 
  [Kislali] How do the U.S. and NATO policies toward Bosnia 
affect Turkey? 
  [Sanberk] They cause in us a lack of confidence in the 
future. We do not know how long this post-Cold War period will 
last and how it will end. Also, when other confrontations will 
arise -- and they probably will -- what will happen to the 
principles we tried to protect together during the Cold War? 
Will the world become chaotic? Despite that, we are 
approaching the developments realistically. We offer our 
cooperation to our European and American allies.

  [Text] Habur, Diyarbakir -- Deputy Prime Minister Murat 
Karayalcin, who made a whirlwind visit to Diyarbakir Monday [2 
May], startled the people of the region with two promises. 
  The deputy prime minister promised that a new democracy 
package, formulated jointly by his Social Democrat People's 
Party (SHP) and its coalition partner True Path Party (DYP), 
would be disclosed in the first half of May. Then he promised 
the region's people, who are in the midst of an economic 
recession, that trade through the Habur border gate, a main 
point for Turco-Iraqi border trade, would be reactivated soon. 
"The reactivation of trade through the border gate is important 
for the revitalization of trade in the region," Karayalcin, who 
traveled in a private plane to Diyarbakir's Habur gate, told an 
accompanying group of journalists. "The purpose of this visit 
is to observe the situation existing at the Habur gate, which 
occupies an important position in regional trade," said the 
deputy prime minister. Trade through Habur gate, the main point 
for border trade between Turkey and Iraq, was restricted two 
years ago due to "security concerns." The move brought an angry 
response from the traders in the region: The Diyarbakir Chamber 
of Commerce threatened last month to violate the embargo if it 
was not compensated for its losses. 
  Karayalcin was also informed of a number of local 
complaints. 
Habur customs official Ali Akinci and a group of Kiziltepe 
Chamber of Drivers administrators, who briefed Karayalcin on 
their difficulties, asked the deputy prime minister to 
reactivate economic activity in the region and rescue them from 
unemployment. 
  The deputy prime minister responded by promising the speedy 
reactivation of the border gate. 
  "Due to reasons of security and taxation and some other 
concerns which I do not want to elaborate on now, the gate has 
been inactive since 1992. We are aware of the difficulties. At 
this point, Turkey is approaching a new era in its fight against 
terrorism. The terrorist group is on the verge of collapse. 
Now the Habur gate can be reactivated, with a new 
understanding." He said his findings in the region would be 
assessed by the government and a final decision would be made. 
  "Let me also tell you, I have another piece of good news: 
The 
coalition partners will disclose the democratization package to 
the people in the first half of May," he added, to shouts of 
"Prime Minister Karayalcin" from his audience. 
  It had been announced earlier that the package would be 
finalized by May 5, but now it is claimed that it will be 
disclosed by next week at the earliest. Karayalcin's earlier 
statements to the press on the reopening of the Habur gate, 
however, indicated that the issue was still being assessed. 
  The visit took place after Turkey's calls for the flushing 
out and storing of the oil in the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline 
appeared to have been given the cold shoulder. "We are 
continuing our talks with American officials. We want to give 
the Western world and the United States the message that the 
impact of the suspension of trade with Iraq has become 
unbearable," Karayalcin said. "Reactivating the Habur border 
gate will not conflict with U.N. resolutions and Turkey's 
international obligations," he insisted. 
  He stressed that another aim of his visit was to make a new 
assessment at this particular stage in the matter of Turkey's 
security. 
  "A new assessment between all related bodies, including the 
General Staff, will be made. My visit aims to speed up such an 
assessment," he said. 
  Turkish ambassadors in key countries will also travel to the 
region later this week.

<F P=106> ["Political Bulletin" column by Derya Sazak: "Inelegant </F>
Dealings"] 
  [Text] An early evening at the residence ... Tansu Ciller 
is quietly listening to the former minister whom she has not 
seen for quite some time: 
  "We cannot hold the group together if you do not let go of 
the SDPP [Social Democratic Populist Party] and form a coalition 
with ANAP [Motherland Party]. It is uncertain where the 
dissolution within the TPP [True Path Party] will lead. I am 
afraid the intervening forces will take power if we do not do 
anything. 
  The prime minister breaks the silence when the conversation 
is directed to speculation regarding the army: 
  Ciller's reaction is: "Actually problems will arise if I 
go." 
  It is interesting... Before the 27 March elections, Mrs. 
Ciller who said "If we fail the PP [Prosperity Party] will come 
to power," is trying to communicate the message that the General 
Staff's Office will not be pleased with the political void that 
will emerge when she "withdraws" as a result of the pressure on 
her which is the inevitable result of the economic crisis. 
  Actually, Turkish politics have been led in the wrong 
direction in recent weeks. Impossible scenarios are envisaged. 
What is dramatic is that there are democratic writers who talk 
about an "elegant" 12 March model [an ultimatum from the 
military and the formation of a nonpartisan government] in their 
columns and define as "encouraging" those developments which 
will open the parliament to outside intervention. 
  As if today Turkey is governed by a government which does 
not 
enjoy the confidence of the Assembly! As if soldiers are at the 
door!... As if the sound of marching troops is heard again and a 
situation exists where a coalition has to be formed hastily with 
ANAP instead of the SDPP. As if the army submitted or will 
submit a memorandum! No. A situation which necessitates a 
takeover by the army is not existent in the country today. And 
it will not exist tomorrow. Because a new government will 
emerge from within the parliament if Ciller fails. There are no 
other alternatives in democracies. Paving the way for a 
military intervention by conducting searches for an "elegant" 
nonpartisan approach will mean hindering Turkey from moving in 
the same circles as first rate democratic countries, downgrading 
it. 
  Unfortunately, the "intervention" theses of civilians 
confuse 
everybody from the businessman to the parliamentarian, from 
former ministers to the prime minister. Afterward, there are 
mindless people presenting their formula of "nonpartisan interim 
government." 
  Unquestionably, there are lots of scenarios discussed in 
Ankara. However, aren't we overthrowing the democratic regime, 
which we believe in and defend, by discussing these alternatives 
and exaggerating our estimates of their feasibility? 
  Whereas, it is possible to point to the failures and 
successes, without confusing the people. This is the 
responsibility that falls on the press and on the enlightened 
people of the country. 
  Looking at the current political upheaval in our country it 
is possible to envision the following scenarios: 
<H5>  Government Without Ciller </H5>
  Overthrowing the TPP-SDPP coalition without one of them 
withdrawing on its own can be achieved only by a referendum. 
226 votes are needed for a referendum. The present coalition 
cannot be overthrown without these 226 votes. The government 
falls only if the SDPP withdraws from the coalition or Ciller 
resigns. As long as Mrs. Ciller is the TPP's leader, 
transferring the premiership depends on her own will. 
Otherwise, the way to an "extraordinary congress" is barred to 
her in view of the TPP regulations regarding changing prime 
ministers. 
<H5>  ANAP-TPP Coalition </H5>
  Yilmaz states that he is ready for all coalition 
alternatives 
and is proposing a government without Ciller. It is assumed 
that if Mrs. Ciller is out of the coalition then she will 
certainly not continue to be the leader of TPP. Ciller, in 
turn, knowing that the ANAP-TPP coalition will oust her, is 
trying to perpetuate the SDPP coalition as long as she can. One 
of the preliminary conditions for an ANAP-TPP coalition is the 
dissolution of the present government. 
<H5>  Saracoglu's Technocrats </H5>
  Former Central Bank director Rusdu Saracoglu comes to mind 
first. When Saracoglu's name was uttered at a Young 
Businessmen's Association meeting with the participation of 
General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, the "rating" of 
the technocrat model increased. Although Saracoglu denies these 
speculations, as a precaution, his dossier is being blown out of 
proportion. 
<H5>  Ekrem Ceyhun Incident </H5>
  Ceyhun's pretense at playing the role of an impartial prime 
minister, at a time when he has completely withdrawn from 
politics, by writing reports on how to save the country may be 
the outcome of Cankaya's "half premiership" calculations. 
Seeing the "capabilities" of the present cadre, Demirel may be 
thinking "let Tansu withdraw and I will govern the country." 
Or, Mesut Yilmaz may have thought of Ekrem Ceyhun as a fitting 
prime minister in case a coalition is formed with the TPP. 
<H5>  Ecevit Model </H5>
  Also under discussion is a coalition that will be formed by 
Democratic Left Party leader Ecevit with the big groups in the 
Assembly. Cindoruk's indecision and Ecevit's vision of 
mastering foreign and national policies contributes to his name 
being put forward as prime minister both by ANAP and by groups 
in the parliament with common sense. 
  Yes, it becomes more difficult to reach a solution when 
there 
are so many alternatives. When thinking of overthrowing Ciller, 
some people tend to think about undemocratic solutions. Mrs. 
Ciller will go one day, but it will take us years to reestablish 
democracy if we end up dissolving the parliament in our search 
for an "elegant" interim regime. We have watched this movie 
before. We cannot bear to go through it once more. 
  In the 21st century, it will be a shame to live in a Turkey 
where the government will pass from hand to hand with coups 
d'etat.

  [Text] Ankara--The General Staff headquarters on Sunday ]1 
May] denied press reports that military leaders are trying to 
promote the idea of setting up a government under former Central 
bank chief Rusdu Saracoglu and moves to extend the term of 
office of Chief of Staff General Dogan Gures who faces 
compulsory retirement in August. 
  On Sunday, mass circulation daily SABAH published a claim by 
Culture Minister Fikri Saglar, also the secretary general of the 
ruling Social Democrat People's Party (SHP), saying that General 
Gures and some other leading members of the Turkish Armed Forces 
were making contacts to set up a government of technical experts 
led by Saracoglu as an alternative to the current government of 
Tansu Ciller. 
  Saglar said Gures has to reply to such claims and give a 
straight answer as to whether he is making such contacts. Both 
SABAH and daily GUNAYDIN also reported on Sunday that Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller has had secret meetings with State 
Ministers Necmettin Cevheri and Bekir Sami Dace to seek ways of 
extending Gures' term of office. 
  Both the papers said Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin, 
the chairman of the SHP, did not object to such an extension. 
SABAH said only Demirel is against such a move, because legal 
experts say such an extension is legally impossible. 
  GUNAYDIN, which has military links, said Ciller asked her 
ministers to work on the extension maneuvers in strict secrecy 
and that parliamentary approval should not be necessary. 
  The paper said Ciller told the two ministers that she had 
agreed with Gures on a democratization package and added she did 
not want the general to become a target of criticism if such an 
extension is carried out. 
  The general staff announcement said the public knows well 
that the military is not the authority to set up governments. 
The announcement said the newspaper reports are based on 
political assumptions "which have nothing to do with the duties 
of the military." 
  It called the press reports absurd and said the public 
should 
not give any credence to such allegations.

<F P=106> [Report by Kemal Balci] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--A full scale political war appears imminent 
as the search for an alternative government gathers steam and as 
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller steps up her opposition to 
"alternative names." 
  The prime minister, acutely aware that new models to replace 
the True Path Party (DYP) and Social Democrat People's Party 
(SHP) coalition government are being discussed, has accelerated 
her secret political war against the powerful names who favor 
change. The proposal for a parliamentary inquiry into the 
activities of Yusuf Bozkurt Ozal, Kaya Erdem, and Ekrem 
Pakdemirli that might lead to their appearance before the 
Supreme Parliamentary Council, submitted by DYP parliamentary 
group deputy chairmen on instructions from the PM [prime 
minister], is an example of how this war is being conducted. 
  The failure of the coalition government to curb the economic 
crisis has given new momentum to the search for alternatives. 
Efforts to promote a True Path-Motherland coalition--favored by 
the group of businessmen known as "the Barons of Istanbul"--have 
intensified. 
  It is noticeable that solutions which foresee the removal of 
the two main opponents (namely DYP chairman Tansu Ciller and 
ANAP [Motherland Party] chairman Mesut Yilmaz) to the government 
model called ANAYOL (Mother or Main Road), debated for more than 
two-and-one-half years, are multiplying rapidly. It is also 
reported that the plan had reached the final stage; the next 
step was to find staff for the new government, formulate a new 
program and establish a new balance of power that would change 
the division of seats in parliament. 
<H5>  Formulas in and out of parliament: </H5>
  Two factors which appear to worry the prime minister and 
bring the search for alternative government models to an 
advanced stage are the "alternative economic program" prepared 
by Ekrem Ceyhun, who is known to be very close to President 
Suleyman Demirel, and a second program being prepared by Ilhan 
Kesici, ANAP's Istanbul mayoral candidate and former 
undersecretary of the State Planning Organization. 
  It is reported that the program prepared by Ceyhun, together 
with Mahir Barutcu, could be implemented immediately if a 
DYP-ANAP coalition came into being. The two programs could also 
be combined, or at least made compatible, after talks between 
the two sides. 
  However, the greatest obstacles to the DYP-ANAP unification 
remain the chairmen of the two parties and this has resulted in 
a "war of attrition" being waged by deputies on their chairmen. 
As the actions of the conservative and religious wings of the 
DYP, which originally put the future of the present coalition at 
stake, continue, the idea of DYP-ANAP coalition is being openly 
expressed to the PM in parliamentary group meetings. 
  DYP's deputy chairman Esat Kiratlioglu, responsible for 
party 
organization, claims that "democracy was born in the group after 
Tansu Ciller came to power. 
  "Nobody could talk of such things in Demirel's time (as 
chairman). Even then similar ideas existed but they were being 
expressed secretly. Now they are being expressed openly. Let 
it be this way, there is nothing to fear," he said. 
  Kiratlioglu said that Husamettin Cindoruk, considered to be 
the leader of the opposition within the party, has always been 
part of the opposing group but no longer has any followers, thus 
no political power. Kiratlioglu also claims that there is 
nobody strong enough to be an alternative to Ciller. 
  As for Ekrem Ceyhun, Kiratlioglu claimed to be aware of his 
program but also thought that Ceyhun had no support other than 
that of Demirel. 
  Kiratlioglu appeared to take an even harder line against 
opposition at a press conference on Sunday [1 May], when he 
accused ANAP leader Yilmaz of "calling for a civilian coup" by 
encouraging establishment of a new government by anti-democratic 
means. "There is a movement to destroy the True Path party as 
well as remove Ciller from the prime ministry," Kiratlioglu 
said. "We will not allow that. The government is standing 
firm." 
  Kiratlioglu's approach to the issue is one of the tactics 
being used by Ciller who has told her deputies that a coalition 
with ANAP would result in the party losing power and its 
eventual disintegration. According to Ciller it is not possible 
for two parties to address the same section of the electorate 
and remain viable. She asks why should ANAP be kept alive by 
allowing it to share power and says that this would not, in any 
way, serve the interests of the DYP. The prime minister 
maintains that the present coalition government will carry on 
until the general elections when the DYP will take power on its 
own, wiping out ANAP in the process. 
  Cindoruk, on the other had, says in private conversation 
that 
Ciller, to whom he refers, unflatteringly, as "that girl" and 
hints at her lack of experience and her political naivete, will 
be unsuccessful despite her good intentions. 
  Cindoruk also maintains that those who had criticized him in 
the past should look at the present situation and admit that he 
had been right. "The government and the high officials in the 
bureaucracy are incompetent. The mistake was made by Demirel 
right at the beginning when he assembled a weak staff and the 
mistake has not been corrected up to the present day." Cindoruk 
says. 
  The same commotion regarding ANAYOL can also be seen in 
ANAP. 
Istanbul deputy Naci Eksi's criticism of Chairman Mesut Yilmaz 
and demands for his resignation are interpreted as the 
extensions of the search for a new government. ANAP'S former 
group deputy chairman and Bayburt deputy, Ulku Gokalp, is also 
critical of Yilmaz. Istanbul deputy Gurol Soylu, founder of the 
party and late president Turgut Ozal's personal office director 
Fevzi Isnasaran, together with Huseyin Aksoy and Engin Guner, 
who was close to Ozal, are also known to be supporters of the 
idea of partnership with DYP. Gunes Taner, who is not a member 
of this group, was also said to support the DYP-ANAP partnership. 
  It is also reported that Yusuf Bozkurt Ozal has taken the 
initiative to form an umbrella group for those who are 
"resentful of the leaders." 
  Apart from these parliamentary "efforts," a new formula, 
which debates the establishment of a technocrat government -- 
ironically known in political corridors as "government of 
brains" -- to be headed by Central Bank ex-governor Rusdu 
Saracoglu, is simmering. This formula is a throwback to the 1971 
Nihat Erim government, when President Cevdet Sunay, in the wake 
of a military memorandum, asked Professor Erim to form a 
non-party government. 
  It is claimed that the present debate and the search for 
possible names for such a government is being kept alive -- 
particularly at a time when political parties in parliament will 
be forced to say "yes" to such a development because of military 
pressures. 
  Pondering on possible names for "government of brains," the 
Turkish media comes up with the following: 
  "Yavuz Canevi, Zekeriya Yildirim, Ercan Kumcu, Hasan Ersel, 
Kadir Guney, Gazi Ercel, Mahfi Egilmez, Ertugrul Kumcuoglu, 
Yavuz Ege, Metin Koksal, Bulent Gultekin, Salih Neftci, Kemal 
Dervis, Cetin Hacaloglu, Vural Akisik, Yilmaz Karakogyunlu, 
Veysi Sevig, Cem Alpar, Deniz Gokce, Taner Berksoy, Sukru Binay, 
Murat Kudat, Sener Oktay, Merih Celasun, Erdogan Ertozun, Aksit 
Kayalar, Gunal Kansu, Varan Tuncel." It is also claimed that 
the search for a new government would be an alternative to the 
"government of brains" thesis and the same names could be used 
by a Motherland-True Path coalition. Ciller, meanwhile, is 
trying to keep her parliamentary group united, utilize her 
"foreign support" card and gives the message that "we will all 
go down together" if economic prosperity is not secured. Her 
aim is to prevent her deputies from launching new alternatives. 
But new alternatives are sure to appear after July 5, 1994 -- 
the date which marks the end of the three month waiting period 
which Ciller requested before results of her economic package 
became apparent.

  [Text] A new party named Main Path Party [MPP] [Anayol 
Partisi] has been established. The petition on the 
establishment of the new party was submitted to the Interior 
Ministry Secretariat General by Gurcan Baser on behalf of the 
founders council. The party has 31 founding members. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Burak Gercek] Different 
scenarios have recently been proposed with regard to our 
political life. The most talked-about proposal consists of the 
unification of the True Path Party [TPP] and the Motherland 
Party [ANAP] under the Main Path banner. This was realized 
today, but only in name. The participants are different. We are 
now asking MPP founding leader Baser why they chose this name. 
  [Baser] We used our right as citizens and 31 of us 
established a party in line with the Political Parties Law. In 
our country, division in the political spectrum demonstrates the 
governments' inability, rather than their strength. It will be 
beneficial for the parties with similar platforms -- the party 
in power and the main opposition party -- to integrate. We are 
inviting all parties with similar platforms to unite under our 
roof. 
  [Gercek] Whereabouts in the political spectrum are you 
situated? 
  [Baser] Free economy and Ataturk nationalism. I believe 
that these two phrases are sufficient.

  [Excerpt] Activity in the foreign currency markets 
intensified with Standard and Poor's decision to reduce Turkey's 
credibility rating for the third time. Standard and Poor's 
reduction of Turkey's credibility rating from BB to B Plus 
stirred the dollar value in the banks and on the black market. 
The value of the dollar varied from 34,200 to 35,150 Turkish 
lira in the interbank markets when the market opened yesterday. 
However, the Central Bank's decision to have the Turkish 
currency bought and sold with an interest of 400 and 600 percent 
respectively reduced the value of the dollar. The dollar ended 
up dropping only 150-200 Turkish lira. 
  By yesterday evening the banks were in short supply of 
Turkish lira, forcing them to sell some of their accumulated 
dollars. Consequently, the value of the dollar decreased to 
34,400 Turkish lira when the money markets closed for the day. 
Compared with the previous day, the value of the dollar still 
increased by 400 Turkish lira. Meanwhile, the interest on the 
Turkish lira fell from 400 to 375 percent. 
  The situation on the black market was no different from that 
in the banks yesterday. The fall in Turkey's credibility rating 
in the international money markets increased the demand for 
foreign currency. The value of the dollar was 33,300 Turkish 
lira on the black market early the day before yesterday. It 
increased by 1,200 Turkish lira to 34,500 by noon. But the 
balances changed by the evening and sales increased. 
Consequently, the increase in the value of the dollar was only 
100 Turkish lira when the markets closed. The dollar was worth 
33,400 Turkish lira. 
  The German mark was in a similar situation. It rose from 
19,900 to 20,300 Turkish lira. 
  Experts have predicted that foreign currencies will continue 
to fluctuate over the next few days. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Turkish Grand National Assembly has approved 
the authorization bill which empowers the Council of Ministers 
to issue law-decrees to adopt measures for privatization. 
  The authorization bill, which was approved during last 
night's Assembly session under Vefa Tanir, transforms the Public 
Corporations High Council into the Privatization High Council 
and the Public Corporations Administration Chairmanship into the 
Privatization Administration Chairmanship. Under the bill, the 
authority to privatize is given to the Privatization High 
Council, chaired by the prime minister and composed of three 
ministers and the chairman of the Privatization Administration. 
  However, privatization decisions regarding commercial 
institutions, which do not fall under this [word indistinct] 
status but whose entire capital belongs to the state or to 
public corporations, will be approved and effected by a Council 
of Ministers decree. The bill expands the scope of 
privatization and stipulates that a Privatization Fund be 
established to collect the income resulting from privatization 
moves. 
  Furthermore, the bill envisages that unemployment benefits 
be 
paid to persons, who are employed on a salary in the 
institutions pegged for privatization, who are dismissed with 
severance pay, and who are left unemployed as a result of the 
privatization, reduction in size, liquidation, or closing down 
of these institutions. Moreover, an account will be opened in 
order to assist these persons in finding new jobs and retraining 
them, and funds will be transferred to this account from 
privatization revenues. 
  Under the bill, the duties allocated to the Public 
Corporations Administration with the aim of encouraging the 
workers to save and utilizing these savings as well as the 
administration of the Public Corporations Fund is transferred to 
the Treasury and Foreign Trade Undersecretariat. According to 
the bill, the Council of Ministers will be able to use the 
authority to issue law-decrees in connection with privatization 
measures for three months.

  [Text] We will open our news bulletin with a sensational 
piece of news: The European Parliament's condemnation of the 
appointment of any Fascist ministers in the Italian Government 
could in fact be false. The affair of the motion approved by 
the Strasbourg parliament, which has unleashed bitter argument 
in Italy, is shrouded in mystery. 
  The National Alliance alleges that the Italian translation 
of 
the motion has inserted the additional sentence -- following the 
horrors of Fascism and Nazism. This phrase does not appear in 
the French language version of the motion that was approved by 
the European Parliament, nor does it appear in the motion 
translated into the other official parliamentary languages. 
  The incriminating passage completes the appeal to the 
Italian 
Government to respect the values of the European Community. 
According to National Alliance spokesman Francesco Storacce, the 
insertion of the sentence is not a technical oversight, but a 
miserable propaganda exercise. European Parliament President 
Egon Klepsch intends to set up an inquiry. We are awaiting 
further developments.

  [Text] As we said earlier, the political day was 
characterized by two events: the final effort on the part of 
Silvio Berlusconi to form the new government and the reactions 
to the motion warning against fascism approved by the European 
Parliament. However, now let's see how Berlusconi's political 
day went. Mario De Scalzi reports: 
  [De Scalzi] Berlusconi is a little closer to reaching his 
goal, and perhaps the decisions concerning the appointments in 
the new government could be only a few hours away. However, as 
far as the most delicate question -- who will be in charge at 
the Interior Ministry -- is concerned, the prime 
minister-designate must place his trust in the mediation of 
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. This was the explicit request 
made by Umberto Bossi, who tomorrow may go and meet the 
president. 
  Today it was Berlusconi's turn to meet the president. 
Officially the visit was made in order to update Scalfaro on 
the progress of his negotiations to form a government. The 
meeting lasted over two hours, so it is difficult to believe 
that the subject of the Interior Ministry was not touched upon. 
A number of rumors are circulating in the press; one maintains 
that the Interior Ministry will be given to Berlusconi on an 
interim basis, and another says that this most delicate post in 
the government will be assigned to a technocrat. The name of the 
head of the police, Vincenzo Parisi, has been mentioned. 
  Late this evening Berlusconi denied that he had ever 
bartered 
with the Northern League on the question of the ministries. He 
also assured Bossi, who fears that any government would be 
chosen solely by the prime minister. 
  [Begin Berlusconi recording] As far as I am concerned, I 
will 
do all I can to make sure that we have the best government 
possible in this situation. Naturally, we must be realistic and 
take into account the fact that the chosen government will have 
to obtain the approval of the Chamber of Deputies and the 
Senate. In other words it will not be a government made up of 
the prime minister's men, as some have suggested. We must form 
a government which obtains a consensus, and which is able to 
convince the allies of the Freedom Alliance of its capabilities.

for sale and this is why we want a political ministry and not 
only an economic one. We shall be the guarantee; if the 
government were to threaten democracy, it would not last two 
seconds." 
  Bossi seems to agree with [Roberto] Maroni, who offered a 
way 
out to Berlusconi by asking for the Foreign and Treasury 
ministries instead of the Interior Ministry, which is a problem. 
The League leader also attacked the prime minister-designate: 
"He thinks the state is a company he can raid."

<F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi by </F>
Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "Berlusconi: `I Will 
Continue Alone'" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [Prime Minister-Designate] Berlusconi at 
the head of a "totalitarian government?" "Not every accusation 
deserves an answer," says the prime minister-designate in this 
interview with IL GIORNALE in reference to the accusations made 
by [Northern League Secretary] Bossi. "Rather, I would say that 
these accusations are totally unfounded and certainly deserve to 
fall on deaf ears." 
  [Guiglia] Do you feel like a winner, given that the most 
important ministries have gone to Forza Italia? 
  [Berlusconi] The most important ministries are in the safe 
and expert hands of independent individuals whom I trust, of 
course. Or is a minister who enjoys the trust of the prime 
minister against the Constitution? 
  [Guiglia] [Northern League lower house floor leader] Maroni 
says that you do not trust the League: Why did you bring it 
into government then? 
  [Berlusconi] I trust the League, its voters, and most of its 
ideas and battles. I trust [League ideologue] Miglio, Speroni, 
Maroni, and even Bossi, even though he is doing all he can not 
to deserve this. 
  [Guiglia] Will you allow yourself to be influenced by 
Bossi's 
pauses for reflection or will you take the list of ministers to 
the Quirinale [office of the president] anyway? 
  [Berlusconi] If I were not to inform my allies, if I were 
not 
to discuss patiently with them, I would make the mistake of 
being presumptuous and of disdaining the rules of politics. If 
I were to allow myself to be influenced to the point where my 
right or duty to be accountable to the head of state and 
parliament for the task of forming the government and 
designating the ministers under my responsibility would be 
called into question, I would be going against Article 92 of the 
Constitution. 
  [Guiglia] Bossi maintains that you are in a hurry to form 
the 
government because you are afraid of the judges: What do you 
have to fear? 
  [Berlusconi] I have absolutely nothing to fear. I am in no 
hurry to form a government, it is the country that cannot 
understand the reappearance of the old temptation to share and 
parcel out. Bossi has become like Oscar Wilde: He can resist 
everything, apart from temptation. [Berlusconi ends] 
  The long distance thrust and parry between Berlusconi and 
Bossi lasted the entire day. Probably the League's request for 
a pause of reflection had been taken into account. Berlusconi 
certainly does not lose his composure when the news comes that 
Bossi will not take part in the summit meeting called to resolve 
the Viminale [Interior Ministry] dilemma: "I will go ahead 
anyway." 
  The Knight [Berlusconi nickname] seems determined to apply 
Article 92 of the Constitution whether the League ally is 
(temporarily) absent or not. It is up to the prime 
minister-designate to choose the ministers and submit the 
proposal to the Quirinale. Berlusconi pretends not to see the 
empty interior ministry box and continues to draw up the rest of 
the list, knowing well that -- or hoping well that -- the League 
will nevertheless return to the negotiation table. 
  "As for what has happened up to now," the Knight explains, 
"I 
think I have given due consideration to all the allies in the 
Freedom Alliance and will continue to do so without losing sight 
of what clearly emerges from the fundamental law of the 
Republic." An indirect and unequivocal message to Bossi: come 
back to the negotatiations, but in the knowledge that in the end 
the prime minister is the only one who is responsible for making 
the choices. Berlusconi will not let go. Moreover, this is not 
the first time that Bossi suddenly abandons talks that have just 
started. "This does not seem a threat to me," the Knight adds.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Maroni: `I Am the Only Candidate'"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- "The basic problem is: `Do you trust the 
League or not?" This is how [Northern League lower house floor 
leader] Roberto Maroni put the matter: handing over the 
Viminale [Interior Ministry] to the Bandwagon [League nickname] 
was a question of trust. He then added: "I am the only 
candidate for the Interior Ministry. No other name was ever 
mentioned during the discussions. And there are no objections 
from the Quirinale [office of the president]" 
  The League is therefore insisting on having the "qualified 
ministries." Maroni explained why: "If we had wanted to raise 
the price, we would have already concluded the negotiations, and 
we would have been given six or seven ministries." The League 
has really turned the Viminale into its Piave line [World War I 
defense line]: "Given that no other name has been mentioned, 
they must explain to us why they are refusing to give us this 
political presence. The League will convene its group tomorrow 
(today -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) and will make a decision." 
  The bandwagon's number two said that the allies had offered 
the League the Labor Ministry -- an offer which was apparently 
declined: "We would have been open to the objection that a 
representative of ours in this ministry might have furthered the 
North's interests, rather than those of the bridge over the 
[Messina] Straight." According to Maroni, apart from the 
Viminale, the Bandwagon is aiming for the Treasury, Industry, 
and Budget ministries. This, however, is not because it is 
power-thirsty: "We are not interested," Maroni further 
explained, "in so many ministries or in obtaining as much power 
as possible. We are interested in ensuring that the League's 
presence in the government is such as to enable us to fulfill an 
effective political role on the issues around which the League 
was created and for which the League has fought for the past 15 
years." 
  For his part, League Senate floor leader Francesco Speroni 
was sarcastic about the League's ally: "Seeing how Mandela 
treats De Klerk, I think it is easier to talk to Mandela than to 
Berlusconi." 
  As regards the difficulties involved in the negotiations, it 
was Maroni who concluded: "A government will be formed in any 
case. As far as we are concerned, this parliament will result 
in a government. We are committed to this."

<F P=106> [Report by Stefano Marroni: "Achille's Challenge: `They </F>
Want To Overthrow Me, But I Will Not Go"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Two weeks have been enough. A handful of 
days have been enough to bring about the collapse of the 
official truth proclaimed from Botteghe Oscure's [headquarters 
of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] second floor, i.e., 
[PDS Secretary] Achille Occhetto's words emphatically uttered 
before the PDS's top brass: "My leadership is not being called 
into question." It was only 20 April then, but it feels as if 
centuries have gone by, following a succession of interviews and 
opinion polls, moves and countermoves, coded signals, and drops 
of poison, which are daily racking the party's nerves. Today it 
was the "leader of the turn" who unveiled his views by saying -- 
in the course of a long interview with L'UNITA -- that the issue 
is an open one, although it will not be easy to solve it 
because, as Occhetto has made it clear, he has no intention of 
stepping down -- except after a tough political battle. 
  The secretary's decision to take a hard line -- explaining 
that a change of leadership would be suicidal, and sending out a 
message which, in the words of someone outside politics, could 
be translated as "I am up here, try to get me if you can" -- 
matured somewhat unexpectedly. It matured precisely on the day 
when [PDS Deputy Secretary] Massimo D'Alema's expected return to 
the PDS secretariat was announced officially -- the same day 
that a lengthy discussion took place at Botteghe Oscure about a 
long article in IL MESSAGGERO, which, in suggesting that 
[L'UNITA chief editor] Veltroni's possible election was part of 
a "secret plan" devised by Occhetto against D'Alema, gave many 
people the impression that it was an attempt to torpedo the 
candidacy of L'UNITA's chief editor (which the interested party 
himself denied yesterday in very harsh tones). 
  This, then, was the reason for Occhetto's statement: the 
newspapers. L'UNITA "Occhettologue" Alberto Leiss described a 
secretary who "did not conceal his deep concern," the "difficult 
moment" experienced by a man who "has no intention of letting 
himself be pushed aside" only because people like Salvati or 
Cacciari were openly speaking of this possibility in the 
newspapers. However, although apparently replying to such 
people, Occhetto was in fact addressing the PDS itself, saying 
that "while, on the Right, bellicose leaders were emerging who 
are eager to concentrate enormous power in their hands, we are 
falling into the trap of destabilizing the leadership of the 
sole force which, albeit in defeat, has shown any vitality and 
consistency. I believe that this attitude," the secretary 
stressed, "is tantamount to hara-kiri." 
  This was an open challenge, followed by the emphatic 
assertion that the leadership issue could only be settled on the 
political level. The "anticommunist condition" set by Salvati 
and Cacciari is "even somewhat foolhardy, and, in a pinch," 
Occhetto added ironically, "accepting it might enable me to 
remain secretary for who knows how long." 
  Faced with Occhetto's clinging to his post as secretary, 
Leiss was looking for reasons, and found them. So Occhetto 
stays -- he asked -- and that is the end of the matter? Or is 
it true that you will resign after the European elections so as 
to keep D'Alema out by means of Veltroni? No, Occhetto replied, 
there is no plan, other than that of "bogging down the PDS over 
the issue of the leadership and the so-called internal 
struggles." The real issue is a different one, the PDS leader 
warned, namely, that there are only two ways of replacing the 
secretary. If the problem is posed in terms of a simple 
"turnover," he emphasized, "say so openly and, after the 
European elections, I will have no objection to stepping down," 
so as to prevent the congress from being reduced to a "petty 
power struggle," to the scene for "personal confrontations at 
the top." However -- Occhetto went on to say -- if someone at 
the congress wishes to move toward a political confrontation, 
"submitting an alternative motion and linking his own candidacy 
to the latter, let him do so: This is the only democratic way 
to solve the leadership issue." 
  The outlined path is really unprecedented for a former 
communist party. At the same time, it is an open challenge, as 
it faces anyone contemplating the replacement of the PDS 
leadership with the choice between appearing to be motivated by 
personal ambition, or, alternatively, confronting the 
uncertainties -- and the disruption, and the paralysis -- of a 
vote count, down to the last vote. 
  Essentially, without ever calling a spade a spade, Occhetto 
was flatly saying "no" to the role of "transition guarantor" 
which D'Alema had suggested to him, and was casting the 
suspicion of a negotiated co-opting procedure on the Veltroni 
option, thus depriving it of any "novelty." This scenario can 
be expected to give rise to serious tensions at PDS headquarters 
within the next few days, on the eve of the new distribution of 
responsibilities which, to a great extent, hinges on the 
"Gallipoli deputy" and L'UNITA's chief editor's return to the 
secretariat. 
  Within the PDS, the scuttlebutt is now suggesting that next 
week Occhetto will name the secretariat's coordinator(s), and 
casting some doubt on the reappointment of Davide Visani, who is 
still recovering from health problems. What the political 
framework will be, however, it is as yet difficult to say, until 
we know the results of the European elections, among other 
reasons because, from the grassroots -- and with some 
considerable support from the guarantee commission -- the 
request is being put forward to vote for the party's leaders one 
by one, with an open list.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "They Fear Contagion"] </F>
  [Text] The news of the European Parliament's vote urging 
Italy to observe the principle of democratic antifascism hit 
newspaper and television editorial offices like a bombshell at 
2200 yesterday evening. Our continent's most senior body 
(elected, let us not forget, by universal suffrage by all the 
community's peoples) "demands" --this is the word used in the 
document -- that all member states call our country to order and 
urge it to observe the founding principles on which the European 
Community was created after the disasters of the war and after 
the defeat of fascism, which cost bloodshed and lives not only 
to the European nations but to the entire world. 
  This has never happened before. Never has a sovereign body 
such as the Strasbourg parliament, a body which derives its 
legitimacy directly from the people, issued such a lofty and 
solemn signal, such an imperious warning, and never has one of 
the member and founding states of the European federative 
structure found itself in such a distressing and humiliating 
position of international isolation. 
  Evidently the Europeans -- of whom the Strasbourg parliament 
is the representative expression -- regard political events in 
our country from a profoundly different viewpoint from the 
relative majority of Italians, who voted for the right-wing 
alignment 27 March. We said the "relative" majority, and this 
aspect of the matter should be stressed: Even if the League is 
included in the right-wing alignment, which has always declared 
itself to be antifascist, the total amounts to 42 percent of the 
votes cast; 58 percent of voters, of the center and the Left, 
voted against it. 
  The attitude of the 42 percent of Italians who voted for 
Berlusconi's coalition (though, without the League, the figure 
falls to barely over 30 percent) is to forget the past; the 
European Parliament, however, has reaffirmed the importance of 
memory, of historical identity, of the constitutional legitimacy 
on which basis democratic Europe was rebuilt. 
  Europe fears contagion by Italy: This is the sad fact 
conveyed to us from Strasbourg. For that matter, we have 
received the same message in recent days from all the European 
and Western capitals -- whispered discreetly by government 
officials and shouted out loud by the democratic parties and 
major newspapers of the West. 
  The new political class that emerged victorious from the 27 
March elections underestimated these events. They paid them no 
heed. They blamed them on foreign newspaper correspondents 
"manipulated by the Communists," as Mr. Berlusconi 
contemptuously declared. 
  Well, it was, and is still, a much larger issue than that; 
the conflict is much more serious than was imagined by a 
businessman who within the space of three months has become a 
political leader and prime minister-designate. He thought that 
management of a television firm was sufficient experience in 
order to manage a major country set in its international 
context. He thought that his redeeming presence was enough to 
cancel out historical and political ascendancies that have never 
been disavowed. It is not so. Europe disagrees and is issuing 
a warning; Europe is protecting us. It suffered contagion once, 
and it does not want that fact, that disaster, that tragedy, to 
be forgotten. 
  Our chief of state has proudly rejected Europe's warning; 
our 
democratic principles are firm, he stressed, and we do not 
accept lessons. And we Italian democrats feel torn by 
conflicting feelings. On the one hand, we would like to express 
solidarity with Scalfaro in his proud defense of our people's 
free and democratic decisions against any foreign interference. 
  But, on the other hand, we wonder: Is Europe foreign? Are 
we not Europeans as well as Italians? Was this not the profound 
principle that emerged from the disastrous war? Are we not 
members of that same family, and should we not therefore respect 
the principles and institutions that we all freely provided for 
ourselves? 
  This is the serious dilemma with which the European 
Parliament has confronted the Italian people's political 
conscience. 
  Meanwhile, we learn that Mr. Berlusconi convened the 
management of the Fininvest company to examine the situation 
last night, while [Northern League leader] Bossi is threatening 
to withdraw from the coalition. This is the state we have 
reached: the victors still arguing about the sharing out of the 
ministries after a month, the prime minister-designate 
consulting the managers of his company-party on matters of 
state, and Europe alarmed by the prospect of neo-Fascist 
ministers. 
  It is a sad spectacle, and the future is uncertain. The 
stock market was the first to recognize the fact, and after so 
much euphoria, selling began to increase.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Walter Veltroni: "Bad Signs for Berlusconi"] </F>
  [Text] The spectacular vote by the European Parliament, the 
sign of an unease that must not be underestimated, was merely 
the last episode in what was a difficult day for the Right that 
won the elections. Something is changing in the subdued 
atmosphere that has surrounded the government majority's first 
steps. The bulldozer thrust which began immediately after the 
elections seems to have suddenly ended, and a sinister creaking 
seems to be emerging from the leaderships of the majority 
parties. It should be assessed for what it is, without 
dismissing it and without any pointless optimism. 
  [Northern League Secretary] Bossi called for a pause for 
reflection in the negotiations. [Prime Minister-Designate] 
Berlusconi replied to him curtly, "I will continue." Bossi 
demanded the Interior Ministry. [National Alliance leader] Fini 
sent him the following message, via the press agencies: "I 
would not grant the Interior Ministry to the League." Bossi 
demanded, like others in the consultations, a separation of 
powers between the prime ministership and ownership of economic, 
financial, and media concerns. Berlusconi replied by appointing 
three watchdogs, which even such a moderate as Sergio Romano 
described as "a false step: It is as though a `defendant' had 
the right to choose `his own judge.'" I believe that even Bossi 
knows that he cannot continue indefinitely to make loud protests 
while at the same time reaching petty agreements. His electoral 
strength has already been greatly reduced. And he really does 
risk finding himself in the government as an irksome and 
subordinate ally, rather like some of the nonconfessional 
parties in the old five-party coalition. 
  Meanwhile, the prime minister, who is striving to project an 
image of "prudence and moderation," is having to take account of 
the broadsides coming from several directions. Including the 
most unexpected ones. When someone yesterday brought to his 
attention the critical interview given by prospective foreign 
minister Antonio Martino, Berlusconi replied confidently: "I 
have not read the interview; I will certainly find expressions 
of respect and esteem in it." Let us mention some of Martino's 
expressions of "esteem" in his regard: "Berlusconi has been 
infected by the virus of politics more seriously than you can 
even imagine." And, asked by the interviewer for his opinion 
about the meetings with the social partners, he replied: "I do 
not approve of them at all. How could I deny it?" 
  Then there are [Northern League Senate floor leader] 
Speroni's attack on Martino, the MSI's [Italian Social Movement] 
questioning of the Osimo Treaty, and the Christian Democratic 
Center raising its voice. And [Radical leader] Pannella, who is 
constantly losing ground. He was foreign minister, then justice 
minister. Now there is talk of an Environment Ministry post for 
Emma Bonina -- maybe. Really. Meanwhile the demands that 
Berlusconi should have expected are coming from both at home and 
abroad. Berlusconi assured Professor Modigliani "that there 
will be no fascist ministers in the government." We shall see. 
When the prime minister announced his own candidacy in the 
European elections, as a joke, he received a deluge of 
criticisms. As though to secure guarantees of Europeanism, 
Kohl's party asked "Forza Italia" to join the Christian 
Democratic group in Europe. And the Socialist parties have 
announced that they will not attend European meetings with 
fascist ministers. 
  A fine mess, in other words. Domestic problems and natural 
tensions and anxieties abroad. It is fortunate that everything 
started under the banner of speed, decisiveness, lack of 
negotiations, and the new republic. There is no need to point 
out that, in the process of forming his government, Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi displayed much greater autonomy than has been 
seen at the "majority summit meetings." Everything resembles 
the old games, a return to the old Cencelli manual [supposed 
rules for spoils sharing], to cunning, and to tactical, affected 
games. This is the situation just over a month after the 
victory of the right-wing forces. And we must wait and see what 
will happen when Berlusconi is in government and has to meet the 
expectations, hopes, and promises -- often very conflicting -- 
which he created during the election campaign and which granted 
him victory. 
  A major scope for initiative could open up for the 
opposition. This, on condition that it makes itself heard at 
once. As long as it shows that it has understood that in the 
new political system a new kind of opposition is necessary too. 
New, because, for the first time since the war, it finds itself 
confronted with a genuinely right-wing government. And because, 
more than ever before, it will have the task of waging a tough 
battle while at the same time indicating feasible and 
alternative solutions. There will be several oppositions, 
including one of the center. It is by no means a bad thing that 
it expresses itself with an identity of its own. It is in the 
battles of the months ahead that the various tendencies of 
Italian democrats will make themselves known and will be able to 
identify, through opposition, whatever convergences and progress 
they can achieve together. Meanwhile, on the Left, we should, 
as I have already said, put an end to the endless talk about 
possible leaderships and also to the boring litany of tears. 
This, because we must feel a duty. That of meeting the 
expectations of a million Italians who voted for the progressive 
forces. The intermission is over. Now we must start the race. 
And it is a new, difficult, and fascinating one.

  [Text] Foreign Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said 
that Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias made no promises--as 
Tirana claims he did--in connection with Albanian claims that 
radio stations and other organizations are being obstructed from 
operating in northern Greece. Bikas said Papoulias never 
promised not to obstruct operations. Bikas was commenting on 
reports that the claim was made during the Zurich meeting 
between Papoulias and Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi, 
and that the Greek side supposedly accepted it.

<F P=106> [Report by Yeoryios Karelias] </F>
  [Excerpts] What was the outcome of Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou's "romance" with U.S. President Bill Clinton? Did it 
promote solutions to our national problems? [passage omitted] 
  It must be made clear that the prime minister has placed 
all, 
or almost all, of his hopes for help with the national issues on 
the United States. His references to the European partners were 
ironic and bitter. He did not neglect to blame the European 
Union's 12 equal parts exclusively for the tragedy in the former 
Yugoslavia. The PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] 
government's decision to "play everything" according to the 
"U.S. card" has its risks. Only time will tell whether it will 
be "successful." 
<H5>  The Ice Has Broken </H5>
  The visit had many sides, at least two of which were 
positive, one negative, and some neutral. We cannot predict the 
final outcome. 
  1. The visit "broke the ice" that was created during PASOK's 
first eight-year term when Papandreou was not invited to the 
United States either by Ronald Reagan or George Bush. According 
to one of his associates, it has long been clear that the prime 
minister "wanted like crazy to visit the White House at last." 
This visit helped enough to change Papandreou's "Third World" 
image in the transatlantic "friend and ally." 
  The prime minister may have disagreed, in Clinton's 
presence, 
with NATO's decision to bomb the Bosnian Serbs if they did not 
retreat but all of his other positions and statements were far 
from those made during the eighties when the PASOK government 
said "no" or simply expressed "reservations." 
  Much of the mass media may still continue their anti-Greek 
attacks (a lot could be written about the false and directed 
reports of some newspapers and journalists and the lack of Greek 
reaction) but a change can be seen in the handling of Greek 
positions. It cannot go unnoticed that Clinton spoke at least 
twice of an understanding of Greek sensitivities and concerns. 
It is also important that reports in major newspapers and 
magazines moved within the same spirit. Without being 
pro-Greek, the reports expressed accurately and objectively the 
situation in the Balkans and the Greek views. If there was no 
"thorn" in our relations with Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], certainly Greece could have 
played a very significant role in the area and influenced 
(although this is extreme) the U.S. policy. Something like this 
would not leave the major European countries indifferent. 
[passage omitted] 
  2. The most tangible outcome of the visit is economic 
relations. It was probably the first time in Greek history that 
a Greek prime minister gathered for a speech several hundred 
businessmen, including the leaders of giant concerns. There is 
U.S. interest in investment in Greece, especially in tourism 
(marinas, casinos), in the medical industry (medicine), in the 
food industry, and in high technology sectors (electronic 
calculators etc.). 
  There is equally intense interest in establishing 
Greek-American businesses in the Balkan region, which is known 
to Greek businessmen. The Americans, who do not want to take 
risks in an unknown area (U.S. investments in countries north of 
our border are almost nonexistent) "place their bets" on the 
Greek experience. President Clinton made special reference to 
this issue. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Stagnation on Skopje </H5>
  3. Those who expected that upon his return from the United 
States, the prime minister would announce a solution to the 
issue of Skopje were probably disappointed. After 10 days of 
meetings there is stagnation--the term deadlock does not express 
the reality. Although Greece was discreetly pressured to lift 
the embargo against the neighboring state, it was the first time 
that its concerns, which are based on historical facts, as 
Clinton said, were recognized so openly and so officially. 
Perhaps it is the first time that the United States has urged 
the neighboring country to change "the angle from which it looks 
at the problem," according to the U.S. President's expression. 
  We must not overlook that all the negotiations are being 
held 
while the Greek embargo applies, despite the Skopjean 
Government's original position that it cannot negotiate under 
pressure. It is also clear that the United States has accepted 
the Greek embargo as part of the negotiations and despite 
discreet objections that are being expressed publicly by some 
U.S. officials, it sees the embargo as a measure that can speed 
up the solution to the problem. 
  Of course this does not mean that the Greek side has 
achieved 
a triumph. There is no such prospect and everyone has accepted 
it. An "honest compromise" is being sought, which is not visible 
right now as both countries "estimate" the cost of making the 
first move. Many people believe that if [FYROM President Kiro] 
Gligorov did not have elections next October he would have 
agreed to the proposals of UN mediator Cyrus Vance and U.S. 
Presidential Envoy Matthew Nimetz: To agree to change his 
country's symbols (He has already agreed to an explanatory 
statement that the Constitution does not include any 
irredeemable pursuits against neighboring countries). 
  The question that is being raised now is: How long will 
these negotiations involving New York, Athens, and Skopje last? 
And what will happen in the second phase (if and when relations 
are smooth) when the name issue is discussed? We cannot discuss 
this now. 
<H5>  "Solve the Problems" But How? </H5>
  4. Greek-Turkish relations probably represent the only point 
in the talks that the Greek side would have wanted to avoid. 
Clinton's urging, not to say demand, toward the Greek prime 
minister was more than clear and can be summarized in five 
words: "Solve the problems with Turkey." The reason is the 
neighboring country's escalating domestic problems (dramatic 
economic situation, the Kurdish issue). Greece still holds 
Turkey's "European passport" but it is unknown how long it can. 
The difficulty is becoming more obvious if someone considers 
the importance of the Islamic danger, which threatens the 
neighboring country, for Europe and the United States. 
  5. There is no development in the Cyprus issue other than 
Clinton's "personal interest." U.S. officials did not rule out 
the possibility of upcoming developments in light of the above 
evaluations. 
  The results of a visit must not be magnified and the visit 
itself must not be downgraded, because some results are not 
immediately visible. The statement made by the prime minister 
as he left the United States is true: "Developments will depend 
greatly upon our strategy, tactics, and handling."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ino Afendouli: "A Simple Acquaintance </F>
Meeting"] 
  [Text] He went, saw, and left. This phrase is suitable to 
describe the outcome of the prime minister's visit to the United 
States. Anyone who expected miracles was probably not 
satisfied. The "uncle from America" cannot do miracles any more. 
And if he could, he would do them for himself... [punctuation 
as published] 
  So, was this a customary visit? Or better, an acquaintance 
meeting for one to find out the language that the other speaks? 
There is, however, one question: If we assume that we know the 
language that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou speaks, then 
what language does the U.S. President speak? 
  Lately, the U.S. press is full of analyses signed by the 
"elite" of U.S. journalism on Bill Clinton's inconsistent 
foreign policy. The examples are several: Haiti, Somalia, North 
Korea, and surely Bosnia-Herzegovina. What accusations do the 
top U.S. journalists make against the U.S. President? That he 
has no foreign policy and that he makes his choices based on 
public opinion polls. As a result, the only remaining 
superpower is being continuously exposed. 
  The Greek prime minister's visit to Washington was held 
within this unstable atmosphere. Therefore, we must not be 
surprised that it did not achieve any specific results. 
  This does not mean that anyone can blame the prime minister 
for paying an official visit to Washington. At the same time, 
we must wonder which acts or omissions were made at a foreign 
policy level so that this "transition" to better relations would 
become possible. 
  A country like ours, that geographically belongs to a 
sensitive and unstable region, does not have the luxury to 
reject alliances. Good relations with the United States, the 
great European countries, and Russia are useful. This is one 
issue. The more substantive one is on which axes, other than 
circumstantial alliances, a country like Greece must base its 
foreign policy. It could be said that this issue has been 
solved because the axes on which the Greek foreign policy moves 
are already established: the Atlantic Alliance and the European 
Union [EU]. 
  We know very well that things are not so simple after the 
end 
of the Cold War. In the past three years Greece has faced 
problems that its partners and allies have not faced, at least 
directly. This has led to some misunderstandings that have 
isolated Greece (let us not forget the country's reference to 
the European Court). 
  So, the question is what would be the best way to get out of 
isolation? The current government chose to cultivate privileged 
relations with the United States to overcome some of its 
problems with the EU. There would be nothing reprehensible in 
this if the United States had a similar desire. However, this 
was not seen during Papandreou's visit to Washington. It is 
reasonable to assume that the United States would have wanted 
such relations if Greece played some important role in the 
Balkans. But today, when Greece has burned almost all of its 
bridges, what would be the substance of privileged relations? 
  The United States has no need to mediate in countries such 
as 
Albania, Bulgaria, and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM]. It has direct access. In the former 
Yugoslavia, the United States is playing with the large European 
countries. What services can Greece offer the United States 
when it is isolated in the EU? 
  If we had some role to play in the Balkans--and we certainly 
had--it would have depended on a strong position in the EU. 
Then maybe we could have taken advantage of the competition 
that often characterizes the relations of the United States with 
some European countries. But what about today? 
  Today our relations with the community are ruined and our 
hopes of "privileged" relations with the United States are 
futile. To whom shall we send the bill?

  [Text] In a written statement today, President Glavkos 
Kliridhis stressed that the signing of the Israeli-PLO agreement 
has already gone down in history as a courageous and significant 
step toward peace that will have a positive effect on the Middle 
East and the rest of the world. In his statement, Kliridhis 
hails the international community's interest in the Middle East 
issue and appeals for greater support by the international 
community, particularly the Security Council, to resolve the 
Cyprus issue. 
  Kliridhis said: If the Turkish side remains a prisoner of 
the 
past, then the Cyprus issue will remain a source of disputes and 
danger that could poison the atmosphere in the entire region.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has made it a 
prerequisite of his visiting New York that Turkish Cypriot 
leader Rauf Denktas accept the UN document of 21 March on the 
confidence-building measures. Government spokesman Ioannis 
Kasoulidhis today said that if Kliridhis is asked to go to New 
York, he will go with pleasure if he is told that Denktas has 
accepted the 21 March UN document. Kasoulidhis said there is no 
other reason for Kliridhis to go to New York. 
  Asked whether the government is informed about the meetings 
that Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator 
on the Cyprus issue, is holding in New York on the Cyprus issue, 
the government spokesman described the situation as a waiting 
period. He stressed that the government is not sitting back 
doing nothing. 
  Asked to comment on press reports today on Butrus-Ghali's 
upcoming report, Kasoulidhis said the Cypriot Government expects 
that in his report to the UN Security Council, the UN secretary 
general will attribute blame objectively for the lack of 
progress in the procedure for the confidence-building measures. 
  Kasoulidhis said that any effort not to apportion blame, 
justifying such a thing by saying that it would discourage the 
Turkish side, threatens to discourage the Greek Cypriot side 
tremendously. 
  The spokesman said that the UN secretary general's report 
will be submitted as soon as Butrus-Ghali returns to New York on 
14 May.

  [Text] Ankara--Following UN Cyprus envoy Joe Clark's 
failure to overcome a deadlock in talks on confidence building 
measures, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas sent a letter to 
Clark, reminding him of "facts of the Cyprus question." 
  Denktas, who wrote the letter to Clark earlier this week, 
said he had been "puzzled and surprised" by Clark's remarks at a 
meeting organized by the Carnegie Endowment for International 
Peace on April 23. 
  The Turkish Cypriot president said he was "disappointed" by 
Clark's remarks on the following points. 
  The failure to mention the reasons for Turkish intervention: 
"Naturally, not every one may be aware of the Greek junta led 
military coup in Cyprus of July 1974 and the discrimination, 
suppression, and ethnic cleansing which preceded it for eleven 
years. Also not many would know the legal right of the guarantor 
powers (Turkey, Greece, and the United Kingdom) to intervene in 
Cyprus when the state of affairs established by the 
international treaties of 1960 creating a bicommunal partnership 
Republic of Cyprus is violated. Turkey's timely and legitimate 
intervention in 1974 resulted in the presence of Turkish troops 
in Cyprus and closed the doors for ENOSIS. In the absence of 
this information, Turkey would be seen as an aggressor and the 
positive contribution and sacrifice it has been making on the 
island since 1974 in order to maintain peace and prepare the 
ground for an overall settlement would not be understood and 
appreciated. Turkey has repeatedly stated that it has no 
intention of staying on the island forever and would withdraw 
its troops within the terms of an overall agreement between the 
equal communities of the island," Denktas wrote to Clark. 
  The lack of reference to the Greek troops: 
  Denktas reminded Clark that 10,000 Greek troops were present 
on the island, along with 15,000 National Guard, 10,000 
commandos and a 80,000 fully trained reserve force. 
  "Furthermore, no mention was made of the money spent on 
armaments and the joint Greek/Greek Cypriot side is starting the 
construction of a Greek naval and air base in the south while 
expenditure on arms and armament have reached a record high," 
Denktas said in the letter. 
  Stress on size, rather than political equality: 
  In his letter, Denktas also criticized Clark for his 
reference to the Turkish Cypriot community "that constitutes 
roughly 20 percent of the population on the island." 
  "(This) does not take account of the fact that the criteria 
for political equality of constituent communities is not the 
arithmetic size or proportion of their respective populations," 
Denktas said. "The equal political status of the two communities 
is a well established fact and forms the very basis of the 
current mission of good offices of the UN secretary-general. As 
such, your emphasis on the proportion of the Turkish Cypriot 
population and not its politically equal constituent was very 
unfortunate." 
  In a similar vein with the letter sent to Clark, Denktas 
also 
sent an open message to the world announcing the collapse of 
talks on the confidence-building measures. 
  "Not because of any fault of ours but because certain things 
were done which upset the balance between the two parties, which 
upset what we had agreed to do and changed the complete 
picture," Denktas said. 
  Denktas said a new map was introduced to the Turkish Cypriot 
side. "We cannot say yes to this map because (the new map) 
trespassed into our number one security area," he said, 
referring to the closed town of Varosha.

  [Text] Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus, has said that the international pressure on the 
Cyprus issue may intensify as a result of the economic problems 
currently facing Turkey. 
  Addressing the ZAMAN correspondents' training course in 
Istanbul today, Denktas charged that the United Nations is 
acting on the assumption that there is only one republic in 
Cyprus and the solution remains unsolved because this concept 
does not change. Denktas stressed that Turkey's guarantee, the 
existence of two equal political communities in Cyprus, and the 
acceptance of the Turks as partners and not as a minority 
constitute the cornerstones of the problem's solution. 
  Denktas declared: This is our struggle. We wasted 30 years 
and we are about to launch our 31st year. Thank God, however, 
that we have not made any concessions on these fundamental 
principles. The same tactics were used during the recent 
negotiations. The Cyprus problem currently stands at the same 
point, but pressure is intensifying. This pressure will 
increase even further because of Turkey's economic situation. 
We are obliged to face this as a nation, because the Turkish 
nation would not bow down to any authority regarding a national 
cause.

  [Text] Nicosia, May 4 (CNA)--Trade unions from both sides 
of the barbed wire which divides Cyprus since the 1974 Turkish 
invasion met Wednesday [4 May] at the free areas to discuss how 
they can play a role in building trust and understanding between 
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. 
  In a joint announcement, the six trade unions (three from 
each side) said they decided to stage jointly next November a 
trade union forum in which all labour organisations of Greek and 
Turkish Cypriots will participate. 
  An effort will be made so that the forum will be held under 
the auspices of the European Union while experts from European 
trade unions will be invited to attend. The forum will address 
labour and social-economic issues of common interest. 
  Those attending today's meeting were PASIDI [Pancyprian 
Union 
of Civil Servants], PEO [Pancyprian Labor Federation], SEK 
[Confederation of Cypriot Workers], and three Turkish Cypriot 
unions namely KTAMS, DEV IS and TURK SEN. 
  The joint statement said that the six labour organisations 
"reaffirmed their determination to step up their efforts in 
order to promote and consolidate trust between the two 
communities". 
  It said the common interest and destiny of the two 
communities demanded their cooperation through mutual 
understanding for the joint handling of problems and the 
overcoming of obstacles.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmet Yabuloglu] </F>
  [Text] Nicosia -- TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus] President Rauf Denktas said that they might unite with 
Turkey if the international public continues to commit injustice 
in the Cyprus problem. 
  In a statement on the latest Cyprus development during the 
meeting with Deniz Baykal, leader of Turkey's Republican 
People's Party, who is on an official visit to the TRNC, Denktas 
indicated that the Greek Cypriot side, which maintains the talks 
for merely tactical purposes, is playing a game by entering the 
EU [European Union]. 
  Indicating that the TRNC side's entrance into the EU, in 
which Turkey is not a member, would mean "its integration with 
Greece," Denktas said: "This would mean a limitation of the 
guarantee agreements. We have already given our message to the 
world. By pursuing this injustice, that is, the south of 
Cyprus' joining the EU, they would be securing the complete 
integration of North Cyprus with Turkey. Then, that is how the 
Cyprus problem will be solved. We are now facing such a 
situation." 
  Saying that despite all their goodwill they are still the 
accused side, Denktas hoped that the United Nations would 
retract its mistake. He said: "The United Nations has resorted 
to a method of forcing us either to accept a bad decision or 
face accusations and the Greek Cypriots' entrance into the EU. 
It has thus committed a great injustice. We hope they will 
realize this and correct it." 
  In thanking Baykal for his keen interest in the Cyprus 
problem, Rauf Denktas said: "We want to see the leaders of the 
political parties in Turkey among us during the 20 July 
celebrations."

  [Text] Ankara--Turkey's financial crisis, which has led to 
the collapse of three banks and nine stock brokerage houses this 
year, has now spread to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 
(TRNC). 
  Turkey's Sekerbank, in compliance with a court decision, has 
confiscated part of the assets of Akdeniz Garanti Bankasi, based 
in Nicosia and owned by the Semiler family. Akdeniz Garanti 
Bankasi owed $1 million to Sekerbank, half of which was said to 
have been repaid immediately after the confiscation. 
  Akdeniz Garanti is controlled by Bulent Semiler, former 
general manager of the now bankrupt state-run Anadolu Bankasi 
and a close economic aide of the late President Turgut Ozal. 
Semiler is a major shareholder of Impexbank, which was the 
third and last bank to collapse on April 24. Impexbank, 
controlled by the Semiler and Eliyesil families, was owned by 
fugitive Turkish Cypriot businessman Asil Nadir. 
  Bankers say that most Turkish Cypriot banks are closely 
linked with Turkish banks and that the most recent crisis in 
Turkey has had serious repercussions on the island. "The 
relationship between the Turkish banks and the Turkish Cypriot 
banks are [as published] very complex. In the coming days, this 
complexity will become more apparent," said one banker in an 
interview with the Anatolia news agency. 
  Anatolia reported that Akdeniz Garanti had issued a 
statement 
saying that some circles in the TRNC had deliberately spread 
ominous rumors regarding this bank, in order to tarnish its 
image. 
  "Those circles aim to take control of the bank," ran the 
statement. 
  After the government's April 5 austerity package, the 
Turkish 
Treasury banned three private banks from carrying out any 
banking activities. Following the collapse of TYT [Foreign 
Trade] Bank, Marbank and Impexbank, eight stockbrokers and the 
leading brokerage house AOG Turkinvest have gone bankrupt. There 
were reports over the weekend that a number of creditors (unpaid 
investors) attacked the Istanbul headquarters of Turkinvest and 
smashed its windows. 
  Turkinvest was banned last Friday [29 April] from trading 
activities, just a day after it offered a debt swap to its 
creditors, who claim 1.3 trillion Turkish lira ($38 million) 
from this firm. The Capital Markets Board (SPK) said in a 
statement that it had halted the activities of the leading 
brokerage house, Turkinvest; which now faces the threat of 
liquidation. 
  Turkinvest was accused of becoming involved in fictitious 
repo (repurchase) transactions worth TL 100 trillion. 
  Its chairman, Nasrullah Ayan, said he would not "give up so 
easily."

  [Text] Police are investigating the possibility of a spying 
case against the Republic. The suspects are three Albanians who 
crossed into the free areas from the occupied areas and were 
arrested this morning near a military camp in Nicosia. The 
three Albanians crossed into the free areas from the buffer zone 
in Nicosia but did not tell the interrogators their exact point 
of entry. They testified that they flew to the occupied areas 
from Turkey. 
  The three Albanians were arrested at 0800 this morning in 
the 
vicinity of the Hilton Hotel. A military camp is in this area. 
A taxi driver gave police information on the movements of the 
three Albanians. The Albanians had asked him to take them to 
Agros; as soon as they arrived there, they asked him to bring 
them back to Nicosia. 
  The three Albanians did not have any identity cards or 
passports and gave contradictory testimony to the police, who 
are investigating a case of illegal entry to the Republic. The 
suspects will appear in court tomorrow morning so that a warrant 
for their detention can be issued.

<F P=106> [Opening statement by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez at a </F>
news conference with domestic and foreign correspondents at the 
Moncloa Palace in Madrid -- live] 
  [Text] Good afternoon. Thank you for attending this news 
conference, which I want to make very brief. In view of the 
situation of social alarm existing in recent days and also the 
atmosphere of political crisis, I thought it necessary to 
clarify to you, and thus to public opinion, what my position is 
as head of government and also what the government's position is. 
  First, I must say that I share the climate of social alarm. 
I think that the cases that have appeared recently, the cases 
of corruption -- both the affair of Mr. Roldan [former head of 
the Civil Guard] and the affair of Mr. Rubio [former Bank of 
Spain governor] -- are serious enough to create that climate of 
social alarm. 
  Second, I wish to say that I took on a commitment on 6 June 
last year. During the whole election campaign, but in 
particular on 6 June, the commitment was to a twofold endeavor 
for our country. First, to fight against any cases of corruption 
that might appear, even if they were, as in this case, old 
corruption cases; and, second, to fight to overcome the economic 
situation or the economic crisis that our country was going 
through. These were the two major objectives of the election 
campaign and of 6 June. 
  All of this has to be done in a climate of political 
stability. We have been carrying out that task and shall 
continue to do so. 
  The first doubt that I would like to clear up, because I 
know 
that there is speculation -- and not only speculation, there are 
some opposition political forces that are even calling for my 
resignation as prime minister -- the first thing that I would 
like to clear up is that I am not going to resign. On the 
contrary, I believe that it is my responsibility to remain as 
head of government, to clear up the cases that have appeared and 
any others that may appear, and to continue to fight the 
situation of economic crisis, which we are beginning to 
overcome. I also believe that this uncertainty and this social 
alarm may cause economic harm. Therefore, we must continue to 
fight our country's economic crisis in a serious, rigorous 
manner. 
  You know what the events of the last few days have been, but 
I will give an account of them as a brief summing up. Last 
Saturday [30 April] I received the resignation of the minister 
of the interior -- a resignation related to the political 
responsibility that he accepted for the disappearance of Mr. 
Roldan. I have accepted that resignation and I will explain to 
you now, in order to avoid speculation, that I will be proposing 
to the king that Luis Alberto Belloch should take charge of the 
Ministry of the Interior, as well as his present Ministry of 
Justice portfolio. Thus the Ministries of the Interior and 
Justice will be merged and Luis Alberto Belloch will head that 
double ministry. Because of his sense of political 
responsibility, I have also received [former Interior Minister] 
Jose Luis Corcuera's resignation of his parliamentary seat. 
Naturally this is not a decision I can make; he was elected by 
voters, but I think that it is an honorable gesture on his part, 
from the point of view of political responsibility about which 
so much is said -- and so often -- in our country. 
  Then yesterday afternoon I received -- and therefore I 
understand that the climate from the political point of view is 
a difficult one -- I received the resignation of the agriculture 
minister. He has explained the reasons and of course I want to 
thank him for the effort he made during this time, his good work 
from the point of view of his political responsibility, and 
naturally also for taking on that political responsibility. 
  I also want to underline the fact that I think that one 
should make a distinction: In the case of the agriculture 
minister there was never any enrichment due to his public 
office. Consequently, I think that his explanation yesterday is 
exactly what happened. I think that we should, or that I 
should, accept this resignation and I have suggested that the 
minister be replaced by Luis Atienza, who is now working at the 
General Secretariat for Energy; he knows the ministry well, 
having worked with Pedro Solbes while Pedro Solbes was minister. 
  I remain with the question of political responsibility. In 
the Rubio affair, Carlos Solchaga has tendered his resignation 
as president of the socialist parliamentary group and also the 
resignation of his seat in the Congress of Deputies, 
representing Navarre. In this case, as is also obvious, I wish 
to thank Mr. Carlos Solchaga for the prodigious work that he has 
carried out in all the posts of political responsibility that he 
has occupied. He has done so effectively, with total 
dedication, and, in my judgement, with laudable integrity in 
every way. He is, then, capable, as any of us are, of making 
the occasional mistake, but he has made this gesture, accepting 
political responsibility in a role -- one in the parliamentary 
group -- that has nothing to do with the role he exercised 
before as minister of economy and finance. He has done so 
seeking to register above all the significance of being able to 
help the party and help the government in this situation, that, 
as I admitted at the beginning, is a situation of serious 
difficulty, which therefore calls for serious measures to be 
taken. 
  The filling of that vacant post is not my responsibility, 
but 
rather that of the party's executive and the parliamentary 
group, and in my view it will be filled immediately. 
  So here we have a number of the members of the government 
team or the parliamentary team accepting political 
responsibility, a degree of political responsibility that 
probably exceeds what might be demanded in any democracy, but 
that is perhaps made advisable -- and I am grateful for that 
reason -- by the climate that our country is experiencing. 
  As I do not want this introduction to be too long -- I do 
not 
want to turn it into a speech -- I will repeat, because I want 
it to be perfectly clear, that I respect, particularly in 
certain cases, those people who think that the prime minister 
ought to resign. I do not share their opinion. In some cases, 
I repeat, the call for my resignation may have good intentions 
or foundations and I therefore do not question them. In other 
cases they are part of a political struggle that disregards such 
important factors as political stability. 
  I know that the issue of whether or not the government is 
going to face a vote of no confidence is also being discussed. 
I want to tell you that I do not exclude this. However, 
according to the Constitution, a no-confidence vote happens when 
there is proof that there is a lack of parliamentary support. 
  However, regarding the decision to go ahead with a rigorous 
investigation of the outstanding corruption cases, regarding the 
decision to forge ahead with the policies that are proving 
themselves efficient in bringing us out of the economic crisis, 
in restructuring the labor market and other structural reforms, 
I can assure you right now, this afternoon, that we still have 
parliamentary support. The main one-party support is of course 
that of the Socialist party, the socialist group, with the seats 
it has. However, I spoke with Mr. Pujol, the president of 
Convergence and Union, and he repeated his will to maintain this 
support and this stability. 
  I also had the opportunity to briefly speak to Mr. Arzallus 
[president of the Basque Nationalist Party]. He says he does 
now want to enter into a game that could have destabilizing 
consequences either. 
  Consequently, I think that the stability of our country is 
very important at this key time for getting over the economic 
crisis. My aim is consequently a firm will to forge ahead in 
this twofold direction: I repeat, to clarify the issues at stake 
and to get over the situation that our economy is going through 
-- fortunately all the data and all the impartial observers 
agree that it is getting better.

Gonzalez' Resignation'"] 
  [Text] "May it be very clear that I fully endorse Jose 
Maria Aznar and the position adopted by my party," Abel Matutes, 
People's Party [PP] candidate in the European elections, stated 
yesterday in response to a question from ABC. The head of the 
PP list emphasized that "on various occasions, I, too, have 
called for the prime minister's resignation, since the grave 
situation currently ravaging Spain affects the credibility of 
the whole government and, especially, of its leader." 
  After stressing that he does not question the prime 
minister's personal integrity, the former European commissioner 
insisted that "the resignation of Felipe Gonzalez is necessary." 
Asked about his former, rather reserved declarations, Abel 
Matutes emphasized that "my party requested the prime minister's 
appearance before the Congress of Deputies, and I deemed this 
appearance necessary on previous occasions, just like the 
assumption of political responsibilities." 
  "At any rate," Matutes concluded, "the problem is that, 
whatever the prime minister will say at his appearance, I am 
afraid that it will be too late." 
  M.L.G. Franco reports that in Bilbao Matutes added that "the 
corruption had damaged Spain's international reputation, 
traumatized the Spanish people, and would prevent or slow down 
our country's economic recovery."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jaime Campmany: "Mr. Prime Minister"] </F>
  [Text] Mr. prime minister: Your responsibility in this 
national outrage is on the point of moving from the world of 
politics into the realm of the criminal. You have always sought 
to limit the responsibilities of socialist politicians in cases 
of corruption to two authorities: criminal responsibility to 
the authority of the Courts of Justice; and political 
responsibility to the judgement of the voters, as expressed at 
the ballot box. 
  So far, this formula has offered you enough comfort to 
govern 
and a comfortable calmness in impunity. Legal power finds 
itself politicized to a degree that suits your politician's 
calmness, and the voters have continued losing their confidence 
in you and your "felipismo," but so slowly that one would have 
thought that this confidence would never disappear. Montesquieu 
was quite dead and the vote of the electorate was, to a great 
extent, captive. 
  However, the time came when the functioning of the 
institutions of the state was seriously weakened. The 
traditional and apparently indelible credit in two fundamental 
institutions dropped: the Bank of Spain and the Civil Guard. 
When the governor of the Bank of Spain, who, with his 
signature, guaranteed our banknotes, turned out to be defrauding 
the Finance Ministry and a rogue who abused his position to make 
himself rich; while the director of the Civil Guard turned out 
to be a fugitive from justice on a wanted list with a price on 
his head, then tell me, Mr. prime minister, what can we count on 
in the hallowed halls of the state. And those are just two 
examples, perhaps the most striking ones, but they are 
accompanied by a multitude of large, medium, and small examples, 
like Manrique's rivers, which all lead to the sea! Here, 
corruption is already a broad expanse of sea whose shore cannot 
be seen. 
  It is with sadness and with all due respect that I say this, 
but I have to say it. You, Mr. prime minister, seem at this 
time the leading person responsible for the major corruption 
scandal surrounding the nation and rotting it through and 
through. It is no longer possible to present your sin as a 
simple and venial sin of omission. It is not that you sat 
there, Mr. prime minister, with your arms crossed and your hands 
dangling before the growing flood that has inundated Spanish 
politics, turning it into a sewer. No. It would have been 
possible to blame it on convenience, blindness, clumsiness, or 
on softness, or perhaps on a brazen lack of concern, a feeling 
that "it is none of my business." 
  However, it is possible, and necessary, to find more and 
more 
serious responsibilities in your position. You not only agreed 
to corruption, you not only closed your eyes to it and ignored 
it, you not only "tolerated" it -- in the exact sense of the 
word -- but you went much, much further, Mr. prime minister. 
You hid it; you denied it; you covered it up, as a 
criminologist would say. You made it possible with your 
protection, and you encouraged it with your complacency. 
Moreover, before investigating it, discovering it, and 
condemning it, you turned it into a crime of defamation by those 
who were denouncing it. You insulted the only Spaniards who 
were uncovering, discovering, and showing the voters the stew 
cooking in your kitchen, in your government, in your party, and 
in your entourage. 
  Mr. prime minister, this transcends political responsibility 
and comes close to criminal responsibility. Now you want to 
gain time before accepting these responsibilities, but you are 
only succeeding in drawing nearer to the home of your friend 
Carlos Andres Perez and the painful situation of your friend, 
Bettino Craxi, who has been tried and relieved of his passport. 
In just a few years, you ruined your political life, the 
history of the Spanish Socialist Party, and the hopes of a large 
part of Spain. Leave your sense of shame aside, Mr. prime 
minister.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent J.V. Boo: "U.S. President Forced </F>
To Insist on Resolute Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] New York -- Worried by continual drops in opinion 
polls, President Clinton started a campaign to convince U.S. 
citizens and the rest of the world that his foreign policy is 
resolute and transparent. The Americans are complaining about 
growing confusion with regard to Bosnia, Haiti, North Korea, 
China, and Rwanda.... 
  Over the past weeks, there have been numerous -- though 
inefficient -- attempts to present the new Defense Secretary 
William Perry as an expert on the world's situation, while 
Christopher is still waiting for a brilliant move to gain 
prestige as secretary of state. Quite often the State 
Department and the Pentagon announce divergent positions. 
  Support for Clinton's foreign policy has been continually 
dropping since January. Two weeks ago the alarm went off, when 
the negative score (41 percent) was higher than the positive one 
(40 percent). After months of contradictory statements on 
Bosnia and North Korea, public opinion has become infected with 
the same skepticism about Clinton's leadership in foreign policy 
that is already dominating many foreign capitals. 
  During a special news conference by satellite with 
correspondents of different countries, the President tried to 
restore his image before his allies and enemies, but the meeting 
served more to vent personal frustration about the attacks than 
to reassure foreign capitals with regard to the firmness of the 
U.S. leader. Visibly irritated by a question from a CNN 
correspondent in Sarajevo, Clinton stated that "there are no 
continuous about-faces in my policy on Bosnia, and I have been 
much more active in this area than my predecessor." 
  He admitted though that he "had underestimated the 
difficulty 
of creating a coalition and reaching agreements within NATO," 
but he found comfort in remembering that John F. Kennedy, his 
favorite predecessor, had also discovered that "international 
problems are more difficult than they seem." 
  On the domestic level, Clinton's problem is that the 
Americans want results and, too often, fast results. Under 
these circumstances, the humiliations accumulated in Bosnia, the 
incapability to subdue the military in Haiti, and the absolute 
passivity with regard to the crisis in Rwanda are being 
translated into deep discomfort with regard to the tenant of the 
White House.

<F P=106> [Article by Ahmad Rafat] </F>
  [Text] The signing of the Washington agreements between the 
Bosnian president, Alia Itzebegovic, and his Croatian 
counterpart, Franjo Tudjman, has not meant the end of the 
problems the Spanish Blue Helmets must deal with. An authentic 
diplomatic battle is now being waged against the Spanish 
military in the zone, who are trying to mediate between Muslims 
and Croats so that the agreements can be implemented. The Muslim 
mayor of East Mostar, Smajo Klaric, has leveled harsh criticisms 
of the Spanish troops, accusing them of a lack of neutrality 
and, more seriously, of complicity in the sacking of the city's 
historic treasures. 
  "I have no desire to respond to those accusations," says 
Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Castro, spokesman for the Spanish 
contingent in Medjugorje. "Our work in Mostar is our best 
response." Colonel Luis Carvajal, commander of the Spanish 
contingent, adds: "In the East, we have excellent relations with 
the population. This is not hard to verify. Suffice it to walk 
along the street to note how the people treat our soldiers. In 
the Western part, however, we have very good relations with the 
civil and military authorities." 
<H5>  Threats </H5>
  This may be an indirect way of acknowledging what various 
neutral observers consider problems that the Blue Helmets are 
having with the Muslim authorities. Attesting to these problems, 
in March, two Spanish members of the humanitarian Doctors of the 
World organization were threatened with firearms in their office 
at the East Mostar hospital, which had been looted hours 
earlier. Accusing both doctors of espionage and of trying to 
render the Bosnian male infants impotent with their vaccination 
program, the hospital's director was trying to force them out. 
Incidents of this type, however, are customarily resolved 
quickly by the Spanish military over a glass of a local brandy 
known as loza. 
  "The real problem," says Col. Carvajal, "is those persons 
who, with the war, have succeeded in gaining a certain level of 
power and well being that they risk losing with peace. They, in 
addition to the Serbs, who in one way or another must be brought 
into this process, are the real obstacle to the Washington peace 
agreements." 
  In the eyes of those interested in maintaining the present 
situation -- and they are present on both sides, although in 
greater number among the Croats -- the Spanish Blue Helmets, as 
guarantors of the peace process, represent a real "threat." 
  This "threat" translates into the need for Col. Luis 
Carvajal 
and his assistants to carry out a diplomatic task in Medjugorje 
that is key to the pacification. Their performance is being 
attested to by the constant coming and going of delegations to 
and from the city. Groups of Croats from West Mostar meet every 
day with Muslims from East Mostar to discuss how to restore 
electric power or clear a mined terrain. "Getting daily life 
back to normal," says Col. Carvajal, "is of the utmost 
importance in trying to guarantee the future of the peace talks. 
If we can manage to get water running from the faucets and 
electric bulbs lighting up again, the people will then pressure 
the authorities to not back away from the process." 
  East Mostar has been without water, electricity, and gas for 
the past 10 months. And in that time, 37,000 Muslim refugees, 
victims of the ethnic cleansing being waged by the Croats on the 
other shore of the Neretva River, have arrived on this side. 
Some 57,000 persons now live in Mostar who are totally dependent 
on the humanitarian aid arriving in the city owing to the 
mediation efforts of the Spanish Blue Helmets in recent months. 
  To deal with the new situation created by the signing of the 
peace agreements between Croats and Bosnians, the Blue Helmets 
have had to reorganize. Mostar, Bosnia's second-largest city, is 
situated in this region and has been entrusted to the Spanish 
Blue Helmets. 
  Around mid-March, an Antimortar Radar Unit arrived in the 
city and installed itself in the Muslim-inhabited eastern zone. 
Until then, it had been impossible to determine the origin of 
the mortars that from time to time were being launched against 
the Muslim zone, in violation of the peace agreements.

  In cooperation with the Slovak battalion, the Spanish Blue 
Helmets have also succeeded in reopening road M-17, which 
connects Mostar with Sarajevo. By this route, which had been 
closed for two years after Serb artillery destroyed the bridges, 
it is now easier to get humanitarian aid to Sarajevo and other 
cities in central Bosnia. 
  The change in the situation has noticeably improved the 
morale of the Spanish soldiers. "At last," says one of them, "we 
feel that we are being useful to these people." The Spanish 
command did their utmost to bring about an exchange of the first 
group of war prisoners between Croats and Muslims, to take place 
on the very day following the signing of the Washington 
agreements. As the Spanish wheeled armored vehicle leading the 
convoy of International Red Cross trucks carrying the first 200 
Muslim prisoners entered the city, it was met by a vast crowd of 
people who, after having awaited that moment for eight hours, 
broke out into feverish applause. "That was an unforgettable 
moment," says a corporal, native of Madrid, holding back his 
tears. 
  Agustin, a Blue Helmet member of the Madrid Unit, which has 
been patrolling East Mostar for the past three months, asserts: 
"I have never before seen so many people on the streets of 
Mostar. Something is changing and I am glad for these people. 
After so much suffering, they deserve a little hope." 
  Hope is the watchword of the Spanish contingent in Bosnia. 
"The cease-fire," Col. Carvajal asserts with satisfaction, "is 
being complied with in excess of our expectations, and the 
situation must be made the most of to avoid a regression. We are 
doing our utmost to encourage forward steps, because that is the 
only way to avoid a return to the previous situation."

<F P=106> [Interview with Smajo Klaric, mayor of Mostar, by </F>
correspondent Ahmad Rafat; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Rafat] How do you judge the performance of the 
Spanish Blue Helmets in your city? 
  [Klaric] The Spaniards are doing a very bad job. Between May 
and September of 1993, they were absent from East Mostar for 102 
days. When the Croatian fascists bombarded us, they were not 
here, and that is when we most needed them. The situation is 
improving somewhat now, although I cannot say that I am 
satisfied. 
  [Rafat] Can you be specific as to why, in your view, they 
are 
doing a bad job? 
  [Klaric] They are always sitting in their armored vehicles. 
They come out only to purchase, for a few marks, antiques that 
were stolen by criminals during the bombings. We have the names 
of the guilty local persons, and we will find out the names of 
their Spanish accomplices. 
  [Rafat] Why do you not report this to the military command? 
  [Klaric] I write to the colonel in command of the Blue 
Helmets every week asking him to come and talk about our 
problems, but he does not even answer my letters. 
  [Rafat] What are the problems you want to discuss? 
  [Klaric] Why, for 102 days, did they not patrol East Mostar? 
Why, in the reports he submits to UNPROFOR's [United Nations 
Protection Forces] higher officials, does he always reduce the 
number of attacks and the continual violations of peace 
agreements by the Croatian War Board, thus blatantly favoring 
the Croatian fascists? And most importantly, why do they not 
help us in rebuilding some of our basic infrastructures, so as 
to unburden the lives of the citizens? If they do not reply, it 
is because they know that they have not acted neutrally.

Tsutomu Hata and German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel pledged 
Thursday [5 May] to cooperate in bids to win permanent

  [Text] Bonn, May 5 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
pledged to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursday [5 May] to 
further strengthen Japan's relations with the rapidly expanding 
European Union (EU), Japanese officials said. 
  The officials said both Hata and Kohl agreed that regional 
groupings should be open to maintain free trade. Hata pledged 
Japan's efforts to keep the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) forum as a mechanism to supplement the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade, the officials said, adding Hata supported 
closer dialogue between APEC and the EU. The 12-nation EU is 
expected to expand its membership to include Austria, Finland, 
Norway and Sweden. 
  Hata met with Kohl after talking with German Foreign 
Minister 
Klaus Kinkel about Japanese and German bids to win permanent 
membership in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Hata 
and Kinkel pledged to cooperate with each other in the UNSC 
bids, officials said. Hata and Kohl, meeting for three hours, 
also shared the need for Japan, Germany and other countries to 
support Russia's reform efforts and maintain equal partnership, 
the officials told reporters. 
  On North Korea, the two leaders also stressed international 
solidarity to address Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons 
program, although Hata said Japan believes channels of 
communications with North Korea remain open to achieve a 
negotiated settlement. Asked by Kohl about China's political 
landscape in the future post-Deng Xiaoping era, Hata said the 
collective leadership under President Jiang Zemin is functioning 
and predicted no drastic change in China's open-door policy, 
officials said. 
  Hata arrived in Bonn on the third leg of a European trip 
with 
previous stops in Italy and France. He will visit Belgium next. 
In his talks with Kinkel, Hata said permanent UNSC seats for 
Japan and Germany would benefit UN activities, and Kinkel said 
Germany shares the same view. Hata and Kinkel expressed their 
shared concern over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons 
program, urging Pyongyang to dispel suspicions about the nuclear 
issue, the officials said. 
  Kohl said in the course of his talks with Hata that he gets 
tired as Japan changes its prime ministers every two years, 
according to Japanese officials. 
  They said Hata responded, "I will do my best" to stay in 
power longer than his predecessors. Hata's immediate 
predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, was in power for only eight 
months.

<F P=106> ["ban"-signed report: "Bonn Resumes Supply of Weapons to </F>
Turkey"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 4 May -- The German-Turkish disharmony, 
including the impact on the internal situation in the countries, 
has apparently been settled. The Federal Government yesterday 
announced that, after examining the documents presented, there 
is no evidence to prove that Turkey is using German weapons in 
the fight against the Kurds, thus violating the agreement with 
Germany. Thus, the suspended deliveries will be resumed in May, 
Foreign Minister Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) 
announced after a meeting of the ministers involved at the 
Chancellor's Office. Apart from 15 Phantom aircraft and a 
reconnaissance plane, ammunition, armored cars, and quencher 
cars from the stocks of the National People's Army, as well as 
spare parts, are to be supplied. The aid program involving 
approximately 300 million German marks will expire at the end of 
the year. Turkish Foreign Minister Cetin assured Kinkel on the 
telephone and in a letter that the weapons are only being used 
for the agreed purposes. Meanwhile, it has become clear that no 
legal consequences will be drawn from the violent Kurdish 
demonstrations in Germany at the end of March. A report by the 
Interior Ministry that Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian 
Democratic Union) commissioned for the end of April was not yet 
available yesterday. Negotiations with Turkey on the treatment 
of deported Kurds have not yet been concluded. The view that is 
beginning to prevail is that existing laws are not sufficient. 
  After visits to Turkey, human rights organizations and 
politicians from the Greens Party handed over photographs to the 
government to prove that the Turkish military is using weapons 
and tanks provided by Germany within the framework of German 
defense aid to Ankara against the Kurds. As a result, the 
Federal Government suspended the weapons supplies until the 
accusations could be further researched. The materiel was 
checked at the Defense Ministry. Government Spokesman Vogel 
announced, however, that witnesses were questioned and no 
investigations were carried out in Turkey. The suspicions are 
completely unfounded, he stated. The weapons and tanks that can 
be seen in the pictures are also supplied by other states to 
Turkey or are being produced there under license. Also, they 
were not photographed while in use. Kinkel announced yesterday: 
"The result of the examination is that the use of the weapons 
in breach of the agreement cannot be proven on the basis of the 
photographs. The Federal Government has decided to resume the 
deliveries stipulated in the international agreement on NATO 
defense aid, materiel aid, and special armament aid with 
Turkey." Voigt, the foreign policy expert of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany, has described the government's 
behavior as "scandalous." Kinkel's statement is a "derision" of 
the victims of attacks by the Turkish Army. Kinkel knows that 
the situation there has not changed. Greens Deputy Vera 
Wollenberger accused the government of contributing to the 
Kurds' suffering with its exoneration of the Turkish Government. 
She accused the Federal Government of "deceiving the public." 
  The conference of the federal and provincial interior 
ministers on Thursday and Friday [5-6 May] will once again 
discuss the treatment of Kurds who have committed criminal 
offenses in Germany. Kohl asked Interior Minister Manfred 
Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) to propose consequences 
from the March protests at the highways by the end of April and 
to suggest amendments to the aliens law if need be. It was 
considered unlikely among the government that such a report will 
be available at the cabinet session next week. During a meeting 
of the coalition, during which internal security and the policy 
vis-a-vis foreigners were discussed, the participants realized 
that there will not be enough time before the elections to 
tackle new controversial issues on which the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] and Free Democratic Party of Germany 
[FDP] might disagree. After the CDU/Christian Social Union 
rejected the FDP's wishes for dual citizenship, the FDP is 
likely to reject other aspects of the aliens law until the 
elections. 
  Talks with Turkey on a deportation agreement have not 
progressed very far. Germany wanted Turkey to guarantee respect 
for the human rights of deported Kurds and to promise that the 
deported Kurds will not be sentenced to death. Initial 
considerations concerning the form and the contents of such an 
agreement were voiced within the Federal Government. However, 
formal talks have so far not been held with Turkey.

<F P=106> ["ron"-signed report: "Stercken Criticizes Deficit in </F>
Turkish Democracy"] 
  [Text] Ankara -- Hans Stercken, chairman of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee of the German Bundestag, has criticized the 
Turkish Government for not pursuing the country's 
democratization vigorously enough. He also rejected German 
accusations that the Turkish Army is using German weapons 
against the Kurds in southeastern Anatolia. Stercken is 
currently paying his last official visit to Turkey. At the end 
of the legislative period, he will resign as chairman of the 
Bundestag committee. Stercken held talks with members of the 
Turkish Government and representatives of the pro-Kurdish 
"Democracy Party" (DEP). The expert on Turkey, who has been 
promoting German-Turkish relations since his first visit to 
Ankara in 1956 and who describes himself as an "unreserved 
friend" of Turkey, presented to Turkish President Demirel and 
Foreign Minister Cetin a document he described as a 
"memorandum." In this document, he views democracy in Turkey 
critically. He told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE that he wants to 
discuss with his "Turkish friends" what should happen in the 
country. Turkey, which wants to orient itself toward Europe, 
must adapt to the European standards -- concerning the respect 
for human rights, for example. The Turkish Constitution, which 
was adopted in 1982, is insufficient and in no way corresponding 
to European standards. 
  Thus, the Preamble of the Turkish Constitution and Article 3 
stipulate the indivisibility of the country and of the people as 
a principle that has priority over most basic rights. As a 
result, the Constitution bans the secession of regions from the 
country's territory. Thus, the Turkish military has to 
intervene if political efforts by the Kurdish minority might be 
aimed at the secession of southeastern Anatolia. 
  Stercken stated: "If Turkey claims that the fond European 
hopes are not coming true, I must tell them that, in view of the 
fact that the constitutional, legal, and human rights situation 
does not correspond to European standards, even an unrestrained 
friend of Turkey as myself is not in a position to compensate 
that." He was disappointed that the leadership is reluctant to 
seriously continue the development of democratic structures. 
Many Turkish officials are talking about democratic reforms, 
referring to a coalition document of the conservative "True Path 
Party" (DYP) and of the "Social Democratic Populist Party" 
(SHP), which was adopted two years ago and which also submits 
proposals for amendments to the constitution. Yet these 
proposals are not being implemented systematically. Instead, 
"the politicians still act according to old concepts." Stercken 
admitted there are also leaders in Turkey who see a need for 
action, but the political efforts are usually short-lived and 
not systematic. Occasionally there are signs that somebody 
wants to strengthen democracy, but then the overcoming of an 
economic crisis is usually considered more important. As far as 
the Kurdish issue is concerned, he does not see any readiness in 
parliament to act. The deputies are hiding behind the 
government's decisions. Also, the current local laws, according 
to which 25 percent of the votes can defeat three-quarters of 
the voters by a majority of votes, do not strengthen the 
confidence of the citizens in democracy. 
  Stercken stated that it is about time for Turkey to settle 
its internal problems. The Turks themselves are not yet fully 
aware of the great significance of their country in foreign 
policy. No country is surrounded by so many regions like 
Turkey. Stercken advocated a political settlement of the 
Kurdish conflict on a secure legal basis. Only in this way can 
the extremist "Kurdish Workers Party" (PKK) be "marginalized." 
The general staff has also known for a long time that the 
"Kurdish problem" cannot be settled militarily. A political 
settlement of the conflict would even relieve the military 
because all expectations which have so far been linked with the 
Army have not been fulfilled. Stercken also pointed out that 
any kind of fundamentalism is a step back, no matter whether 
Islamic or other fundamentalist ideas are involved. Yet he 
himself was apparently more worried about the increase of 
fundamentalist groups in Turkey than the politicians in the 
country. 
  Stercken was confident that Turkey will master the task of 
democratization. First it must achieve economic consolidation. 
Confidence in the economic and financial policy must be 
restored. In this connection, he considers it dangerous to brand 
the sale of parts of state-owned enterprises to foreign 
companies within the privatization scheme as "a sellout of 
national assets." 
  In his balance sheet of German-Turkish relations, Stercken 
also criticized German positions. He considers accusations that 
the Turkish Army used German weapons against Kurds unfounded. 
So far, no evidence has been furnished. It is normal for 
German weapons to be found in eastern states. Turkey is a NATO 
country. For decades, Germany has been supplying weapons to 
Turkey. It is logical that weapons are not used on beaches but 
in conflict zones -- at the border with Iraq, Syria, and Iran. 
He strongly criticized the "self-proclaimed princes of peace" 
in Germany who often travel to Turkey without the required 
background knowledge, creating "annoyance and confusion" there 
because they want to acquire a stronger profile during the 
election campaign in Germany. Stercken emphatically advocated 
the deportation of rioting Kurds. "I have never made a secret 
of the fact that these people should not enjoy any hospitality 
in Germany."

<F P=106> ["C.G."-signed report: "Lithuania Concerned About Moscow -- </F>
Prime Minister Slezevicius in Bonn"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 4 May -- Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas 
Slezevicius is visiting Bonn, accompanied by Industry and Trade 
Minister Klimasauskas and Deputy Foreign Minister Januska. 
Slezevicius met with Minister in the Chancellor's Office 
Friedrich Bohl, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, and Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt on 4 May. At a meeting with the 
Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, 
Slezevicius said that German investment was welcome in his 
country. Today he will hold talks with the "Initiative Circle 
of the Ruhr Area." 
  Slezevicius said in an interview with this newspaper: "The 
only alternative for Lithuania is integration into the European 
Union [EU] economic structures to guarantee prosperity." 
Slezevicius thanked Germany for its support and voiced the hope 
that a free trade agreement with the EU that is currently being 
negotiated can be signed in July and become effective by the end 
of 1994. He said that, beyond association, the goal remained 
Lithuania's EU membership. The agreement signed on "Partnership 
for Peace" should be followed by a further rapprochement to 
NATO. "We are hoping for a decision on association with the 
Western European Union [WEU] by the end of 1994, following the 
signing of the free trade agreement." 
  Slezevicius expressed concern about Russia: "Because of 
considerable uncertainties, we can hardly predict anything about 
events in Russia or relations between Vilnius and Moscow." The 
documents signed in November last year with Russian Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin have not yet been ratified by the Moscow 
government. Slezevicius said Russia was trying to link the 
coming into force of these documents with the demand that 
Lithuania permit the transit of Russian military transports from 
the Kaliningrad (Koenigsberg) area across the Baltic state 
uncontrolled: "Lithuania cannot accept that." Lithuania has 
introduced a visa system for border traffic: "It is a foregone 
conclusion that Lithuania, not Russia, decides whether we are 
going to have a visa system." Lithuania is trying to have 
friendly, good, and sound relations with Russia and its other 
neighbors: "However, the dialogue must not proceed upon 
pressure from the great neighbor, but must be conducted 
constructively." 
  The last Russian troops have been withdrawn from Lithuania, 
but no transit agreement has come about. Lithuania wants an 
arrangement "that should be fixed by both sides." Slezevicius 
said that Russian troops and the respective military equipment 
from eastern Germany arrive in Lithuania by ship and are 
transported on to Russia. In each case, Lithuania issues 
transit permissions. "The Kaliningrad area represents a 
problem, not only for Russia and Lithuania, but also for Europe." 
  In view of the concentration of Russian troops in the 
Kaliningrad area, Slezevicius added: "Regional security could 
be improved by demilitarization." He said Lithuanian 
negotiators had asked experts from Denmark and Germany to advise 
them in negotiations with Moscow by making suggestions on the 
transit problem. Separate negotiations were being held on the 
less difficult transit of civilian persons. 
  With Western technology and access to the Eastern market and 
its raw materials, Lithuania could form a "bridge between East 
and West," said Slezevicius. However, this required more 
stability in Russia. Slezevicius said he was concerned about 
nationalist Zhirinovskiy's popularity with the Russia people. 
It was only "under the European shield" that Lithuania could 
protect itself against dangers. Fifty "lost years of 
occupation" had to be made up. That is why Lithuania was making 
a considerable effort to accelerate its European integration. 
The only way was the free market economy. 
  Slezevicius spoke about successes. He said that since his 
government took office on 31 March 1993, the average income in 
real terms, which had decreased in the first three years of 
Lithuania's independence, increased more than 12 percent for the 
first time. Since the middle of 1993, the currency was 
stabilizing. After a rate of inflation of more than 1,000 
percent in 1992, an inflation of less than 50 percent had to be 
expected in 1994, because in cooperation with the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, a strict monetary policy was 
being operated. That is why there were "good prospects" for 
investment, without which the economic sector could not be 
restructured. Political stability was useful for economic 
stability, said Slezevicius: "Following three years of 
independence, Lithuania now has the absolute majority of a party 
in parliament and a new constitution." Privatization would be 
accelerated, and the banking sector restructured. Slezevicius 
mentioned a Swedish financial aid of $10 million for developing 
the banking system in Lithuania and said that it was a signal of 
foreign confidence. 
  Slezevicius said he was satisfied with the Lithuanian-Polish 
agreement that was concluded last week. In the agreement 
Lithuania had dropped its demand that Poland apologize for the 
occupation of Vilnius in 1920. It was more important now that 
Lithuania's borders were recognized and remained secure. Poland 
had expressly called Vilnius the Lithuanian capital. Lithuania 
had dropped its original demand that Warsaw apologize for 
Poland's military action after World War II, because "a positive 
negotiation result is better than none." "It is no good to 
burden the future with the past." Lithuania was also trying to 
achieve progress in the negotiations with Russia on the 
recognition of the borders along the Kaliningrad area and in the 
Baltic Sea. Slezevicius said that agreement had been reached 
with Latvia on the border line. There were still problems with 
Belarus. Following the change of president in Minsk, the 
negotiations were not progressing. An area of 513 hectares was 
at issue. 
  Slezevicius said it was a success of his government to have 
concluded free trade agreements with the other Baltic states, 
Scandinavia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, and a most favored nation 
agreement in trade with Russia. Negotiations were now being 
held with Brussels, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Germany 
was Lithuania's largest European trading partner and investor: 
"Our relations are developing in a helpful and dynamic way."

Eastern Committee of German Industry, by Adelbert Reif; place 
and date not given: "Not Let Ourselves Be Discouraged"] 
  [Text] [Reif] How do you assess the prospects of the 
former Soviet Union to catch up with the West in economic terms? 
  [Wolff von Amerongen] They are not rosy. Apart from a few 
exceptions in the field of high technology and energy, the CIS 
states are currently unable to supply competitive products to 
the international market. 
  [Reif] How will things continue with Russia? 
  [Wolff von Amerongen] Russia will remain a problem for a 
long time. The greatest tragedy of the Russians is that they 
are unable to stop inflation. The National Bank, which should 
actually act as a factor of stability, is the biggest banknote 
printer of the country. And even though it provides enormous 
amounts of money to the armament industry and heavy industry in 
violation of all reason, wages cannot be paid as a rule. 
  [Reif] What should the Germans do in this situation? 
  [Wolff von Amerongen] We must not let ourselves be 
discouraged by the events in Russia. If a great number of 
German companies get involved in Russia, this is done out of 
tradition and human obligation -- but also with a view to the 
large market that will come one day.

<F P=106> ["Stue"-signed report: "German Development Aid for West </F>
Bank"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 4 May -- The Federal Republic is 
concentrating its development aid for the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip on infrastructure projects, training and advanced 
training, and the development of an administration. With German 
aid, five local organizations for water supply and sewage plants 
will be set up. In addition, a project to improve waste disposal 
in the Gaza Strip is being prepared. By the end of 1992, the 
territories occupied by Israel were granted development aid 
totaling 173 million German marks [DM]. In addition, there is 
Germany's share of DM185 million in aid granted by the European 
Community. Last year, the Federal Ministry of Economic 
Cooperation and Development made a new pledge of DM36.2 million. 
Of this sum, DM15 million will go to drinking water supply 
projects in Nablus and Ramallah. The UN Relief and Works Agency 
for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) received DM14.5 
million from Bonn. The current projects include a vocational 
school in Beit Hania, a polytechnical school in Hebron, and a 
waste disposal project in Bethlehem. Projects of church and 
private organizations and of political foundations are also 
promoted. Development cooperation has in the past been faced 
with the problem that, because there is no state as a partner, 
communities must be won over for individual projects. The Bonn 
Development Aid Ministry says, however, that this has restricted 
the volume of possible aid. Bonn's new pledges this year 
include DM10 million for technical cooperation and, for the 
first time, DM10 million in capital aid. Germany also helps 
finance European Union aid programs totalling DM500 million and 
a World Bank aid program totalling $2.4 billion.

<F P=106> [Peter Schmalz report: "The New Eurofighter Is Flying in </F>
the Shadow of the Tiger"] 
  [Text] Munich -- Europe's new combat helicopter, whose 
first prototypes have been tested in southern France in the past 
few months, is called the "Tiger" and attracts public attention. 
However, in the shadow of the beast of prey, a civilian cat, for 
whom experts predict a splendid future, was developed by the 
Tiger producer Eurocopter, a young Franco-German helicopter 
enterprise. The seven-seat aircraft, whose proper technical name 
is EC 135, is to replace the legendary Boelkow hit Bo 105, which 
has been in constant use as a police, rescue, and supply 
helicopter since its maiden flight on 16 February 1967. The 
first civilian helicopter jointly developed by the Germans and 
the French incorporates proven features of its predecessor: The 
four rotor blades are fed by two engines (which is not common in 
the class of light helicopters, but which offers additional 
safety); two rear flaps allow quick loading at the rear (this 
made the Bo 105 the optimum vehicle for rescue operations). 
  "In addition, like the Bo 105, the new aircraft is fitted 
with all possible technical innovations," Elmar Compans, project 
manager of the EC 135 at the German Eurocopter headquarters in 
Ottenbrunn near Munich, stressed. The most important features 
are: Main rotor without bearings whose four 10-meter-long 
blades seem to be firmly connected with the motor shaft where 
other aircraft have complicated oscillation gears. The trick 
that makes possible the rotor inclinations required for the 
flight is the material. The blades are made of compound fiber 
materials that are self-oscillating. Thus, the material never 
fatigues or breaks. For this reason, there was no need for 
bearings or oil at the rotor, and the number of the required 
parts was reduced from 70 to nine. "We are flying with a dry 
head," the test pilot Helmut Rueckert stated. 
  Fewer parts also mean less wear and maintenance. Project 
manager Compans is convinced that the EC 135 will be the most 
easy-to-service aircraft worldwide. "It has been common 
practice so far to replace certain parts even when they are 
still in perfect order. We have succeeded in constructing the 
aircraft in such a way that the parts will only be replaced if 
this is really necessary." 
  Two types of engines are being offered (PW 206 B by Pratt 
and 
Whitney and Turbomeca Arrius-2B). Because a lower machine 
weight allows a higher payload, sheet steel and steel have been 
replaced by light compound fiber materials wherever possible. 
No other civilian helicopter contains more of this extremely 
strong future-oriented material. 
  The two Eurocopter bosses Jean-Francois Bigay and Siegfried 
Sobotta, who gave invitations for the world premier in Bavaria 
today, are convinced that the EC 135, which will first be 
delivered in series in 1996, is not only the most modern product 
of its kind but, according to the current state of knowledge, it 
will also be clearly cheaper in its daily use than the MD 900, 
the U.S. eight- seat aircraft offered by the competitor McDonnel 
Douglas, which has been undergoing tests for one year.

<F P=106> [Ulrich Rosenbaum report: "Scharping's Cabinet Casts a </F>
Shadow"] 
  [Text] When the SPD [Social Democratic Party] holds its 
marathon five-hour party congress in Halle/Saale on 22 June, one 
topic will not be on the agenda -- the composition of the shadow 
cabinet. For Scharping, this is not just a question of proper 
timing, but also a question of principle. Just as the 
chancellor decides on the guidelines of policy, so too will 
Scharping as shadow chancellor decide on people, and when these 
people should be presented to the public. 
  Scharping will not name his shadow cabinet until the second 
half of August, following a brief vacation in southwest France 
(President Mitterrand has already invited him for a tour in a 
jeep). Whether public opinion will be amazed is an open 
question, for Scharping has suggested several times that he will 
reward those who have proven themselves in his government 
program commission. Only one thing has been certain for the 
past week: Transportation expert Christoph Zoepel is no longer 
on Scharping's list. 
  The following can expect seat reservations in an SPD-led 
government: Oskar Lafontaine (finance and industry), Ulrich 
Mauer (internal affairs), Rudolf Dressler (social affairs), 
Hans-Ulrich Klose (foreign affairs or defense), and Peter Glotz 
(currently responsible for the entire future sphere of 
education, science, communications, and the media). Contrary to 
earlier considerations, Scharping has decided not to form an 
independent European Affairs Ministry; European policy is to be 
coordinated with a strong personality in the chancellery, such 
as Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul. However, a Ministry of Female 
Affairs, or at least "a separate slot for female issues," is 
planned, even though Scharping wants to cut the number of 
ministries from 18 to 15. The Ministry for Post and 
Telecommunications will be abolished. Wolfgang Thierse, whom 
several persons would like to see as the new Bundestag 
president, is considered an "Ossi" worthy of the rank of 
minister; the idea of "Ministry for Eastern Reconstruction" is 
not yet extinct. 
  Contrary to earlier hasty reports, it is far from certain 
whether faction general manager Peter Struck will be new faction 
chief if the SPD wins the elections. He would be an ideal 
Chancellery Office chief for Scharping. Scharping's current 
efficient chief of the Office of the Minister-President in 
Mainz, Karl-Heinz Klaer, who is also being considered for the 
Chancellery Office post, must remain in Mainz to guarantee a 
continuity under Scharping's successor Kurt Beck. Too great is 
the worry that the majority in Rhineland-Palatinate could be 
wasted in 1996. 
  Scharping's predecessor, Bjoern Engholm, tried to win over 
Karl-Otto Poehl for Scharping's team. The former Bundesbank 
president said he had spoken to Scharping, but evidently without 
success. Poehl knows where the power in Bonn lies; in the 
Finance Ministry, not the Economics Ministry. But Lafontaine 
also knows this. Poehl has also not responded to the compromise 
offer of including monetary policy among the Economics 
Ministry's responsibilities, not yet in any case.

<F P=106> ["R. L."-initialed report: "The President -- One for All"] </F>
  [Text] It was Herbert Wehner who once said mockingly 
before a presidential election that the Germans would prefer to 
have a Bishop Dr. von Hindenburg as president. These 
expectations -- both comprehensive and contradictory -- have 
obviously not changed, if one looks at our latest poll on the 
elections. 
  According to this poll, the president should get involved 
more in active policy (64 percent), should basically make the 
interests of everyone a guideline of his actions (71 percent), 
primarily try to come to an understanding on contentious issues 
(68 percent), and, above all, tackle issues that affect the 
future (69 percent). In eastern Germany the percentages are 
generally higher than in the west: As many as 78 percent of the 
eastern Germans hope for more involvement in active policy. 
  The idealized expectations placed on a head of state can be 
interpreted as quite definite expectations on political 
integration, which is carried out less and less by the 
parliamentary mechanisms for quarrel and decisionmaking. In 
addition, these high-flown claims are also a reflex reaction to 
a certain "disenchantment with politics." And, of course, they 
are a response to the extremely ambitious and extremely 
satisfying way in which Richard von Weizsaecker has fulfilled 
his office. No wonder that the majority of the voters advocate 
a direct election of the president: A total of 80 percent of 
all Germans want to elect the person on whom they place their 
highest expectations, themselves. 
  The eastern Germans are once again more eager for 
integration: 91 percent demand direct elections, compared with 
77 percent in the west. The question in connection with 
constitutional policy, namely whether such a mode of election 
would conform with the architecture of the office as laid down 
in the Basic Law, naturally does not appear in such polls. 
  Regarding the forthcoming election of Richard von 
Weizsaecker's successor, all this results in tension between the 
citizens' expectations and the parties' game for power. 
Basically, the Germans want to vote themselves -- and if they 
could do that, the majority would vote for Johannes Rau. If 
four candidates are involved, Rau is ahead with 36 percent, 
followed by Roman Herzog with 22 percent, Hildegard 
Hamm-Bruecher with 14 percent, and Jens Reich with 5 percent. 
If the election is narrowed down to two candidates -- Rau or 
Herzog -- Rau gains an additional 18 percentage points and gets 
54 percent; Herzog, on the other hand, only gets an additional 8 
percent and manages to get 30 percent; in the east Rau would get 
69 percent. 
  Certainly, the Basic Law deliberately did not make the 
office 
of president subject to popular vote. However, if Roman Herzog 
were elected because of the all too obvious considerations of 
party and coalition policy, this time clear tension would arise 
between the mood in the population -- as regards the person and 
the political process -- and the institutional mechanics. 
  However, some other observations are quite remarkable. 
First: The voters are clearly turning away -- at least for the 
presidential elections -- from the targets of the coalition and 
party machinery; however, by doing that, the majority of them 
come out in favor of a politician who has long worked in the 
establishment; the offer of a candidate who is removed from the 
parties did not catch on. 
  Second: The slogan that an eastern German must become 
president did not catch on, either; even in the new laender only 
12 percent are in favor of eastern German candidate Jens Reich 
-- 3.5 times as many vote for Rau. 
  Third: Even though during the initial period of the election 
campaign the Social Democrats -- and Rau in particular -- were 
accused, also by Chancellor Kohl, of having betrayed Germany's 
unity before 1989, in direct comparison 69 percent of the 
eastern Germans vote for Social Democrat Rau -- more than 3.5 
times as many as for Herzog (19 Percent). 
  All this refutation of myths also reflects a certain 
"social-democratization" of eastern Germany -- or the 
disappointment about the Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union [CDU/CSU] and unification. When asked about the 
parties' power of conviction, the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] gets 32 percent in the east, thus being ahead of 
the CDU (19 percent) -- in the west the CDU/CSU is ahead of the 
SPD for the first time: 26 to 25 percent. 
  A similar picture can be seen in connection with the 
question 
about the future chancellor: In the west, Scharping got 1 
percentage point more than last time, thus reaching 38 percent; 
Kohl is stagnating at 33 percent. The difference is not as 
large as it used to be, but it is not becoming smaller, either. 
In the east, Scharping is falling slightly behind, from 48 to 
47 percent; Kohl is catching up, from 30 to 34 percent. 
  It may be that the elections will also be decided in the 
east 
in the very last instance, but the majority of the people live 
in the west -- and in all new laender there are just as many 
voters as in North Rhine-Westphalia, the land where Johannes Rau 
comes from -- and where he will remain? 
  Infratest Burke polled 1,000 voters for DIE ZEIT. Those 
polled were chosen through a representative sample (random 
procedure). The poll took place from 18 to 25 April 1994.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "340,000 Troops Are Sufficient in </F>
Times of Peace"] 
  [Text] With his paper on the future development and 
structure of the German Army, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
(Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) has made the Bundeswehr 
subject to public and controversial debates. Shortly after the 
paper was published, it was strongly criticized by his own 
party. A coalition working group will now deal with the matter. 
The following is the paper describing the new tasks and the 
number of troops required. 
  I. Introduction 
  The changing security conditions and Germany's increasing 
international responsibility influence the Bundeswehr's role, 
task, structure, and equipment. 
  In view of the fundamentally changing security situation and 
the limited resources available, we have to define the 
capacities and objectives of the Armed Forces that Germany has 
and wants to keep and adapt them in such a way that they can 
fulfill their tasks in the future. 
  The government's 1994 white book is the planning structure 
for the future of the forces. The planning guideline is the 
necessary link between the white book and Bundeswehr planning. 
It defines specific basic figures for the forces' strength in 
times of peace and defense, as well as their structure and the 
size of crisis-reaction forces. It lays down the necessary 
number of regular soldiers and conscripts for the future 
Bundeswehr and defines the duration of basic military service 
under the future framework conditions. It sets goals for 
optimizing the forces and their operation -- this should achieve 
a better relation between costs and investments. Finally, 
planning aims at maintaining the necessary connection between 
crisis-reaction forces and the main defense forces. 
  II. The Changing Strategic Framework Conditions 
  An analysis of the current situation shows that the 
conditions for European, especially German, security have 
undergone basic changes in three respects: 
  -- Germany is no longer a frontline state, but it is 
surrounded by allies and friendly partners; 
  -- Germany is no longer within the reach of an adversary 
that 
is capable of large-scale strategic operations; 
  -- at the same time, the danger of regional crises and 
conflicts in and outside Europe is increasing, which also 
affects Germany's security. 
  The possible joint defense of German territory with the 
allies remains a necessity. Yet, conflicts are unlikely in 
Central Europe, and they are only imagineable if developments 
change completely. What is much more likely are crises and 
conflicts in other parts of Europe, which we must limit to a 
region, tackle together with the other allies, and thus keep 
away from Germany. 
  The Bundeswehr today is best prepared for the most unlikely, 
if not the most dangerous, event, but it is least prepared for 
the most likely new tasks. This makes it necessary to adjust 
our forces to the future tasks. 
  Germany needs 
  -- Forces for ground defense that can be withdrawn in times 
of peace and are thus more dependent on mobilization, 
  -- and forces for crises, which will be fully present in 
times of peace, ready to act, can be moved easily, and whose 
professionalism enables them to be used for a whole range of 
crisis operations. 
  III. Tasks and Strength of the Forces 
  Due to Germany's geographical situation, a special 
contribution to the main defense forces in Central Europe is a 
decisive factor for Germany's influence in the alliance. Main 
defense forces that can be mobilized are the basis for national 
defense and a crucial element of Germany's importance in a 
central task within NATO, namely collective defense. 
<H5>  Main Defense Forces </H5>
  The main defense forces have to 
  -- provide the necessary conditions in times of peace for 
full defense capacities to be reached in the event of a crisis, 
  -- safeguard an increase in forces through mobilization in a 
crisis, 
  -- defend NATO territory together with the alliance 
partners. 
  The present strategic situation allows a significant cut in 
national defense forces. The militarily usable warning time in 
the event of a major aggression suggests that parts of the main 
defense forces should be released of the operation order in 
times of peace and their full training for operations should be 
moved to times of a crisis. 
  For this reason, the main defense forces within the existing 
divisions of the Army, Air Force, and the Navy are to be 
structured differently from the crisis-reaction forces in terms 
of presence, training, equipment, operation, and supply. 
  The main defense forces are structured in such a way as to 
maintain their combat strength envisaged for defense. Their 
full readiness for action will, however, only be achieved 
through gradual mobilization and intensive training within the 
militarily usable preparation time. 
  These measures aim at two things -- first, at allowing an 
increase in the number of crisis-reaction forces, and second, at 
achieving an overall structure that allows flexibility within 
the given security situation. The necessary connection between 
main defense and crisis-reaction forces is also safeguarded by 
the units of the Army forming a continual supply of forces that 
become available on a step-by-step basis. 
  The defense system that is based on conscripts and 
reservists 
has to safeguard that the forces can be increased to a defense 
strength of 650,000-700,000 troops. Intensive crisis training 
within a scheme of gradual mobilization shall provide full 
defense capacities within approximately four months. These 
conditions can be achieved by means of a strictly organized 
10-month basic military service. 
<H5>  Crisis-Reaction Forces </H5>
  The crisis-reaction forces will have the following tasks: 
  -- in national defense, to deter potential attackers and 
thus 
prevent conflicts through immediately possible action; 
  -- to contribute to crisis management and conflict 
prevention, as well as defense in NATO and the Western European 
Union [WEU], 
  -- to carry out missions from humanitarian measures to 
military operations under the UN Charter for the United Nations 
and the CSCE. 
  In order to fulfill these tasks, the capacity to use forces 
up to a maximum size of a division and appropriate contingents 
of the Air Force and Navy is appropriate and sufficient. To 
achieve this, the following forces, which can be used quickly 
and can be moved to other locations, must be maintained: 
  -- In the Army -- as the German contribution to the NATO 
reaction forces and Eurocorps, a total of five mechanized and 
light air-movable brigades. This number is complemented by the 
necessary combat support and supply troops, as well as the 
German part of the German-French brigade; 
  -- In the Air Force -- six flying squadrons for air attacks, 
air defense, reconnaissance, and nuclear support missions, as 
well as two mixed ground-controlled air defense units, as well 
as two or three air transport squadrons and a helicopter unit 
for rescue operations; 
  -- In the Navy, two ocean-going operation groups consisting 
of two to three ships each, the appropriate components for 
explosives defense and underwater warfare, floating control and 
supply components, a squadron of naval fighter aircraft, naval 
reconnaissance planes, rescue helicopters, and a company of 
frogmen. 
  The necessary availability and professionalism of the 
crisis-reaction forces require that they consist mainly of 
regular soldiers. Conscripts may serve in the crisis-reaction 
forces, if on starting service they declare their willingness to 
be available for all crisis-reaction missions. In order to be 
able to serve in such missions, it will usually be necessary for 
conscripts to serve for at least 12 months. 
  Regarding the duration of basic military service, this opens 
up the possibility to choose between serving at least 10 months 
or a voluntary 12-month mission-oriented service. 
<H5>  Basic Military Organization </H5>
  In order to control the Armed Forces, support their 
operation, enable training and supply functions, for 
civilian-military cooperation, and for support to the allies, a 
basic military organization is required. 
  IV. Conclusions for Bundeswehr Size and Structure 
<H5>  Staffing </H5>
  The correlation between crisis-reaction forces and main 
defense forces, the correlation between conscription and equity 
in conscription, and the correlation between presence and 
mobilization result in a peacetime force of the Bundeswehr of 
some 340,000 troops. It consists of 
  -- some 200,000 regular soldiers and soldiers on a 
fixed-term 
contract, 
  -- up to 135,000 conscripts, with a 10-month service; 
  -- and approximately 3,000 military training grounds. 
  135,000 posts for conscripts at a service term of 10 months 
means that up to 155,000 conscripts can start their service 
every year. 
  As a result of cutting back in military staff, the number of 
civilian personnel can also be reduced accordingly; the former 
target figure of 151,300 for the year 2000 can now be cut to 
under 140,000. 
  This plan is based on the following assumptions: 
  -- that, as in the past, the number of fit conscripts is 
used 
to the fullest extent; 
  -- that, with basic military service being cut to 10 months, 
there will be no compensatory time off for soldiers doing basic 
service; 
  -- that career prospects of the 370-personnel model are 
maintained, and finally, 
  -- that the forces' structures allow for a peacetime 
strength 
of 370,000, if required; this also enables the internationally 
agreed upper limit of 370,000 to be achieved by partial 
mobilizations. 
  Personnel cuts to reduce operating costs and changing of 
structures will lead to the stationing of troops being 
reexamined. Regional availability of personnel, training 
opportunities, infrastructure, and profitability of the 
individual facilities play a role in that, as does the quality 
of life for the Bundeswehr troops and their families. It is 
obvious that consequences for the stationing can only be worked 
out in the course of the planning process and can only be 
implemented over the next few years. 
<H5>  Rationalization </H5>
  The Bundeswehr is short of funds right now. That is why the 
gap between its tasks and funds has to be closed; financial 
leeway is necessary for restructuring the Bundeswehr. 
  This is the only way to make the urgently necessary 
investment toward suitable and modern equipment for the 
crisis-reaction forces, while, at the same time, maintaining a 
minimum degree of a competitive and efficient arms industry as 
part of Germany's security precautions. 
  The profits derived from rationalizations and reduction of 
personnel costs due to cutting back the forces' peacetime 
strength must remain allocated to the defense budget. Only in 
this way will it be possible to increase the investment portion 
and find the original investment necessary for initiating the 
rationalizations. 
  The planning guideline can, however, only be put into 
practice if the 1995 ceiling of 47.5 billion marks remains 
unaltered in the medium term and individual plan No. 14 is 
increased again as of 1997. 
  V. Summary 
  The envisaged reduction of the Bundeswehr's peacetime 
strength and the further development of the forces' capacities 
and structures constitute a moderate intervention in terms of 
quantity -- which is necessary with a view to the somewhat 
crisis-prone situation, and is, quite rightly, expected by our 
citizens and the alliance. 
  In terms of quality, the comprehensive adjustment to new 
tasks and structural reforms is a fundamental change that will 
give our forces a new but also more up-to-date look. 
  The approach described above preserves the defense power in 
alliances on the basis of forces that can be mobilized, while at 
the same time increasing Germany's political capacity to act 
within NATO, WEU, and the United Nations due to its ability to 
act quickly and in solidarity in times of crises.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Kohl: Germany Is Heading Toward a </F>
Good Future"] 
  [Text] Chancellor Helmut Kohl continues to note an 
economic upturn in the new laender. "The things that have been 
already achieved here over the past three years have not even 
started in other areas," he said at an East Thuringia regional 
conference in Gera. "The GNP in eastern Germany has increased 
by over 7 percent since 1993, in Thuringia itself it has even 
increased by a double figure." 
  According to Kohl, private and public investments in eastern 
Germany in 1994 will probably rise to 160 million marks, a level 
of investments that was not even reached during the so-called 
economic miracle years. Germany is heading toward a good 
future, said Kohl. The size of unemployment is still dramatic, 
therefore all efforts will be be made to guarantee growth and 
employment opportunities. In Gera itself, a new Benefits 
Department of the Federal Insurance Fund for Office Employees 
will be set up, with 1,000 jobs. 
  Earlier on, Thuringian Minister-President Bernhard Vogel had 
pointed out the difficult situation in East Thuringia. "Nowhere 
else in the world has uranium ore extraction caused such damage 
as here," he said. Federal Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt 
promised further support for the restructuring of the region. 
The general redevelopment of Saxony and Thuringia will last up 
to 15 years and cost about 13 million marks, he said. But the 
federal enterprise Wismut GmbH also represent a major economic 
factor, he said. The uranium ore extraction areas are 
developing into model areas for environmental and redevelopment 
technology.

<F P=106> ["Welt-Nachrichtendienst" report: "Lufthansa To Be </F>
Privatized"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government and Lufthansa have 
agreed on how the pension claims of the employees are to be 
protected when the corporation is privatized. This cleared the 
last obstacle for a rights issue and the withdrawal of the 
government from the airline. 
  The Federal Government currently holds 51.4 percent of 
Lufthansa. If the government does not participate in the rights 
issue, its holding will fall below 50 percent. As a result, the 
corporation falls out of the government and laender (VBL) 
pension plan, where Lufthansa employees currently have their 
pension insurance. 
  The agreement envisages that the VBL will continue to pay 
the 
pensions of Lufthansa's current 5,500 retirees. For that 
purpose, the government will pay about 1 billion marks [DM] in 
15 annual installments. For the active employees, currently 
numbering about 50,000, Lufthansa will found a company pension 
fund, into which the government will pay DM500 million over 10 
years. The trade unions have still to agree to this settlement. 
  Board of Governors Chairman Wolfgang Roeller announced a 
speedy capital increase of "more than DM1 billion."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Survey: Communes Considered Bad </F>
Entrepreneurs"] 
  [Text] Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic 
Party) expects the privatization of communal enterprises and 
services to create more jobs. 
  At a joint news conference with the Federal Association of 
Young Entrepreneurs [BJU], Rexrodt said that although initially 
there could be personnel reductions because of excessive 
employment in former commune-controlled enterprises, such 
increases in efficiency always mean a saving of funds, which in 
turn means higher profits by privatized enterprises and reduced 
costs to citizens. The leftover profits are then available to 
the enterprises for investment purposes, or to the citizens for 
consumer purposes. In this way, employment opportunities are 
created elsewhere. 
  Apart from this, said Rexrodt, it cannot be assumed that 
financial officials will keep the money earned through 
privatization in a sock. Instead, it will be spent on other 
undertakings that can create new jobs or preserve existing ones. 
The 14,500 communes in Germany provide services that private 
entrepreneurs could provide equally well, therefore the 
potential for privatization is enormous. 
  Happily, privatization among the laender and communes has 
increased, said Rexrodt. However, these must not remain 
isolated cases that were only undertaken because of empty 
coffers. On the other hand there has been an absence of 
consistent privatization strategies. 
  Rexrodt greeted the deal reached between Lufthansa and the 
Federation concerning the airline's privatization. The 
Federation should now encourage the privatization of shares in 
the Rhein-Main-Donau AG, Neckar AG, the State Freeway Subsidiary 
Services Company, and the Deutsche Genossenchaftsbank. 
  BJU Chairman Thomas Suwelack reported the results of an 
Emnid 
survey whereby 70 percent of the respondents had said that the 
communes are bad entrepreneurs, 66 percent had said that 
privatization means not just greater efficiency but also a 
reduction of the burden on communal coffers, and 55 percent had 
said that privatization should cause an improvement to important 
public services.

  [Text] Bonn, 4 May -- In March, orders received in the 
processing industry in western Germany rose 3 percent -- 
seasonally adjusted for price changes -- compared with the 
previous month. In February, they also went up by 3 percent. 
In particular, foreign demand continued to rise clearly, namely 
by 6 percent. Orders by domestic customers, on the other hand, 
rose only by 1 percent, the FRG Economics Ministry in Bonn 
reports. The greatest increase was reported by the investment 
goods sector with a total of +\5 percent. The basic materials 
and producer goods industry registered 3 percent more orders. 
In contrast, business deals for the producers of durable 
consumer goods went down by 4 percent. 
  The more informative two-month comparison (February/March 
compared with December/January) showed an average increase in 
orders by 5 percent for the processing industry. In these two 
months foreign business expanded by 7.5 percent, while domestic 
demand went up by 4 percent. The basic materials and producer 
goods sector registered the highest increase with 6.5 percent. 
In the investment goods sector and the durable consumer goods 
industry orders went up 5.5 percent and 2 percent respectively. 
All together, in February and March 6.4 percent more orders 
were placed than during the same months last year.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Germans Are Not Hostile to </F>
Technology, They Just Want Better Information"] 
  [Text] German industry is in a technology crisis. New 
products and intelligent technological solutions appear on the 
market only rarely. The profound restructuring of German 
industry can only be completed and the mass unemployment only 
overcome by means of innovation. But that involves more than 
the creation of new jobs in research. 
  Norbert Walter, chief economist of the Deutsche Bank, could 
not have expressed himself more clearly when, in a Deutsche Bank 
Research commentary, he complained about the continuing weakness 
of German industry regarding innovations "throughout all 
branches." Many German-produced goods are already out of date, 
and less and less new goods are being introduced, he said. 
  Walter insists a series of measures meant to guarantee the 
integrity of German research. In his analysis, the Deutsche 
Bank chief economist concentrates mainly on the need to change 
society's mentality, because "the current situation with science 
and research encourages a hostility to new technology in 
Germany." 
  There is no doubt that an openness to new technology is very 
important for an innovative climate in politics and the economy. 
The Association of German Industry [BDI] says in its "Theses for 
a Strategic Scientific Policy" that "innovations prepared by 
scientists, research organizations, and enterprises can only be 
implemented if the population accepts them." It is not without 
reason that the Bundestag's Bureau for Investigating the 
Consequences of Technology recently published a survey entitled 
"Is German Society Hostile to Technology?" 
  The results of this survey come as a surprise. It cannot be 
said that the Germans generally dislike new technology. 
Ninety-five percent of the respondents said that "technology 
guarantees the competitiveness of our industry." No particular 
enemy to new technology is to be observed in Germany. What can 
be observed, however, is that society's attitude to technology 
is very differentiated. 
  Mass technologies such as nuclear energy, aviation, space 
travel, and genetic engineering are subject to greater criticism 
than the technologies that are closer to the general consumer 
and used at one's place of work. But the only completely 
negative opinion concerns nuclear energy; up to 70 percent of 
the respondents spoke out against the construction of further 
nuclear power stations. On the other hand, they expressed 
various opinions about genetic engineering, according to the 
questions asked. There was no general rejection. 
  A comparison with the opinions of foreign societies is also 
interesting. According to the authors of the survey, the 
Germans score good points regarding both their expectations of 
the new technologies, and their views on the impact of 
scientific research for social development. Society's views in 
the United States seem more favorable than in Germany, but no 
"technological euphoria" is discernible among Japanese society. 
  The study reveals something that is no secret among economic 
organizations and research institutes, namely that the Germans 
are not hostile to technology; they just want to be better 
informed. But Frieder Meyer-Krahmer, head of the Fraeuenhof 
Institute for Systems Technology and Research, says it is wrong 
to believe that German society does not accept new technologies 
when, in fact, the world of science and industry and the state 
often fail to inform society of the effects and consequences of 
scientific innovation, or fail to discuss these things with 
society in good time. 
  If German society's hostility to new technology is open to 
doubt, one thing seems almost certain -- that the prerequisites 
for research and technology are not optimal. The process of 
issuing permits for new technologies is a very long one, and 
smaller enterprises have to go through difficult administrative 
procedures before they receive money for new equipment. The BDI 
calls for a better coordination of interministerial research 
policy and for a stronger integration of the research 
infrastructure. In the future, innovation policy must be 
considered a task for all political departments. For example, 
the reform of the health administration also has a bearing on 
medicinal research. But for some time now, the state has also 
held a series of new roles on the subject of innovation. 
  The BDI views the Ministry of Research and Technology as a 
supporter of technological innovation on account of its 
political attitude. As strong supporters of the newly formed 
Technology Council attached to the federal chancellor, German 
industrialists have abandoned their previous general stance 
whereby the state should rather keep away from technological 
policy. Peter Biesenbach of the Department of Research, 
Technology, and Structural Policy has a ready made declaration 
in this matter. In the next century, in matters regarding 
central technologies, it is not the decisions of consumers that 
will be important, but the decisions of politicians on the 
subject of the necessary infrastructure. Whether we are dealing 
with telecommunications, transportation, or genetic engineering, 
the introduction of new products onto the market will no longer 
depend on know-how, but on political conditions. 
Telecommunications provides a simple example. If the state 
offers no new telecommunications networks, it makes no sense for 
industry to produce new equipment. Proper planning is therefore 
the keyword, and this can only be done by means of dialogue with 
the state. 
  Meyer-Kahmer is in favor of a "total innovation strategy," 
whereby industry should concentrate on areas where "German 
strength combines with important future technologies." He 
mentions as examples environmental science, transportation, the 
chemical industry, and information technology. He would like to 
see a greater application of technology in the solving of 
problems and thus "detect fluctuations in demand in good time." 
Enterprises should also gear themselves to new industrial 
patterns more easily. For instance, the automobile industry must 
assume a new identity as a "mobility industry" that considers 
its task to be the supply of complete systemic solutions to 
satisfy the demand for mobility. Says Meyer-Krahmer: "To have a 
car or not to have a car is then no longer a question of 
survival, but of expediency." 
  This is worth considering. There are enough ideas on how the 
state, industry, and science can boost scientific innovation. 
Therefore the following principle applies to all concerned: 
Enough words have been said, now is the time to act.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tyll Necker, president of the Federation of </F>
German Industry, BDI, by Ingeborg Zaunitzer-Haase; place and 
date not given: "Second-Class Silver Lining"] 
  [Text] [Zaunitzer-Haase] Even you, who do not tend toward 
excessive optimism or euphoria, nowadays see the economic 
development in a rosier light. When will the reduction of 
unemployment start? 
  [Necker] We are not yet quite that far. First of all, 
foreign demand has started to go up. Now we are all waiting 
tensely for whether and when the spark will jump over to Germany 
itself. This year, one cannot speak of a considerably more 
vivid demand for investment goods and a tangible increase in 
private consumption -- and certainly not for less unemployment. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] When will the turnabout come? 
  [Necker] I expect a turnabout in unemployment for 1995. 
However, an increase in employment does not mean a decline in 
unemployment. This will be the case only as of 1996. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Increase in employment without a decline 
in unemployment -- what does that mean? 
  [Necker] First of all, the silent reserves will be mobilized 
and activated. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Where do you see "silent reserves" on the 
labor market? 
  [Necker] These are the many people in waiting positions. 
Often they have not even registered as unemployed. Others are 
engaged in "job creation measures" or in retraining and advanced 
training subsidized by the state. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Thus, first it will come to a 
redistribution. 
  [Necker] Quite so! What I call the "silent reserve" are the 
people who are working on themselves, who are ready at any time 
to reintegrate into the working process. They can be taken over 
by industry without any major problems. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] And the long-term unemployed will be left 
behind? 
  [Necker] At least for the time being. The decisive group 
that poses problems comprises almost 50 percent of all 
unemployed. They are suffering from a loss in qualification, 
which is almost unnoticeable at the beginning, but continues to 
smolder below the surface. Before the companies take them on, 
those who really want to work and are capable of work will be 
accepted. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Will there never again be as many jobs as 
applicants? 
  [Necker] Anyone who wants to enter working life will always 
have an opportunity. However, the threshold for creating new 
jobs -- that is not the replacement of closed-down capacities, 
but the establishment of additional capacities in the companies 
-- does not only lie in the economic sector. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Where else? 
  [Necker] In the institutional conditions! The more I 
protect the person who holds a job, the more difficult and more 
expensive it is to dismiss him in the case of a bad economic 
situation, the longer an entrepreneur will hesitate to hire new 
people. The state has created virtual barriers for dismissing 
and hiring. In addition, there are the labor costs. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] The latest wage contracts were absolutely 
sensible, even in the eyes of the entrepreneurs. 
  [Necker] They were good -- and, above all, necessary. 
However, one swallow does not make a spring. In other words: 
One year alone is not sufficient to correct the mistakes of 
several past years. Things must be continued with a sense of 
perspective. Otherwise, there is the danger that the "process of 
emigration" -- that is the employment of far cheaper labor 
outside our state borders -- will continue more quickly than the 
hiring of additional labor in our own country. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] The net income of the working people is 
shrinking. 
  [Necker] This is a very essential point. An average of 44 
percent is deducted from the working person's gross income. He 
is left with a net sum of 56 percent. Twenty years ago he still 
received 66 percent in cash. In addition, the ancillary wage 
costs, which must be paid by the companies, have also grown 
strongly. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] But not the wages themselves. 
  [Necker] Just take into consideration that a master 
craftsman must legally work for five hours to be able to pay for 
one hour of the work of another craftsman. This leads to a 
shadow economy and to the destruction of jobs. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Do you see any way out? 
  [Necker] We must put an end to the excessive state 
mechanisms for redistribution. Over the past three years, the 
state and the partners to the wage negotiations distributed more 
than was achieved. The GDP declined, but the sums that were 
redistributed were inflated nevertheless. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Thus, what do you demand from a future 
federal government? 
  [Necker] Not even more redistribution, but cost reduction. 
The state sector must be slimmed down. According to the 
Bundesbank, the share of the state is 54 percent. This must not 
be a permanent condition. The state must privatize, deregulate, 
and gradually reduce the tax burden -- for everyone, by the way, 
not only for the entrepreneurs. And what happens. Just look at 
the new nursing-care insurance. It is constructed in such a way 
that there are enormous side-effects. A grandmother will often 
be declared in need of nursing-care just to get the nursing-care 
money. My criticism is directed both at the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] and the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], 
which has "social-democratized" itself to a certain extent. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] What should the new federal government be 
like? 
  [Necker] We will cooperate with any federal government. It 
is no secret that red-green is not something we desire. It is 
interesting that the most outstanding economics ministers of the 
postwar period -- Ludwig Erhard of the CDU and Karl Schiller of 
the SPD -- were renowned professors of economics with scientific 
experience. This does not mean that economics ministers always 
have to be professors of economics, but I do wish for this high 
degree of knowledge on this matter.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Eastern Cleanup To Cost Up To DM270 </F>
Billion"] 
  [Text] Enormous sums are required to clean up the 
extensive environmental damage in the former GDR, concludes a 
study commissioned by the Industrial Initiative for 
Environmental Protection in the New Laender. 
  Most of the environmental damage in the former GDR was 
caused 
by planned economy considerations. The GDR wanted to increase 
industrial output at all costs, and was never genuinely 
concerned about a clean environment. 
  The Institute of German Industry says major investments are 
required to clear the damage. The lowest estimate is 82.8 
billion marks [DM], the highest is DM521 billion. The widest 
range of estimates concerns the removal of old waste. The cost 
of performing this operation is estimated at between DM3 billion 
and 270 billion. The operation would entail either the 
elimination of acute dangers, for instance by erecting fences 
around contaminated lakes, or comprehensive cleanup work, such 
as the excavation, cleaning, and recultivation of soil. 
  In the GDR, enterprises were supplied with quantities of 
energy equal to the quantities they had consumed during the 
previous period of reckoning, a practice that led to senseless 
waste. Therefore, an enterprise that consumed its coal supply 
sparingly could expect to receive less coal for the following 
period. 
  In this way, energy was wasted without regard to the 
environment, says the report. Therefore, private households 
also felt no encouragement to economize on energy.

<F P=106> [Josef Joffe commentary: "Theater Thunder at the Peace </F>
Festival"] 
  [Text] The stage as a message: This was unprecedented in 
the history of peace agreements -- the abrupt interruption of 
the ceremony in Cairo, the bizarre retreat into the wings, where 
'Arafat, with his eternal theatricalism, once again grabbed the 
dramaturgy to provide the map of the autonomy area with a 
hand-written reservation. 
  An omen for what comes afterwards? The pessimists, whose 
opinion has so far been confirmed by statistics in the Middle 
East, can easily draw conclusions from that as to a dark future: 
Distrust and hatred are rooted too deeply for the peoples to 
free themselves from the prison of violence. Therefore, they 
say, the noble beginning of Washington (on 13 September, when 
Yitzhaq Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat shook hands) will end in a war 
of attrition about details and the enemies of peace will still 
get the upper hand. 
  The optimists may conclude the opposite from the interrupted 
ceremony. Winston Churchill once said: "It is better to 
jaw-jaw than to war-war." Thus, one might understand the 
tug-of-war and the haggling, which did not stop even in front of 
the gathered dignitaries from all over the world, as a 
reassuring omen -- because, first, 'Arafat has never missed an 
opportunity to put himself into the limelight and, second, he 
once again had to prove to his enemies in his own camp how tough 
he is in reality; and, finally, only someone who basically 
accepted the deal a long time ago tries to get an additional 
advantage at the last moment. 
  Nevertheless, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin was right when he 
noted with slight irony: "We watched only the tip of the 
iceberg of those problems that we still have to overcome." 
Where it is not only land, but also mutually exclusive rights 
that are involved, any detail becomes the symbol of the entire 
conflict, which can be called a 100-year war (as Rabin did) 
without any exaggeration. 
  Whether Gaza gets its own telephone prefix (no longer the 
972 
for Israel) or has its own stamps is not a postal but a highly 
political problem. Whose judiciary is responsible for the 
settlers in the West Bank cannot be solved pragmatically but 
only on principle, and behind this there is the most tortuous 
question of all: How much sovereignty for the Palestinians -- 
and how quickly? It is quite clear that a question like that 
cannot be answered at the negotiating table, but only in 
everyday coexistence. And therefore the enemies of peace keep 
their bloody power of veto: Any terrorist attack is a deep 
gouge in the shaky scaffolding of peace. 
  The Israelis can keep the extremists in check with their 
tested state machinery; the PLO still has to demonstrate whether 
it really has the monopoly on power, which is the foundation of 
any state. The brief interruption on the stage in Cairo 
demonstrated theatre, but not tragedy. Whether the latter will 
indeed come to pass will be demonstrated on a completely 
different stage -- there where Israelis and Palestinians will 
have to practice peace as of now: in Gaza and in Jericho.

  [Excerpt] Paris, May 5 (AFP) -- The French Government on 
Thursday [5 May] condemned Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels 
for rejecting talks with the Kigali government and a ceasefire 
to end ethnic slaughter in the central African country. 
  France is "concerned" at the failure of a UN peace bid in 
Arusha, Tanzania, and "deplores the RPF's refusal not only to 
enter talks with the other party but above all to envisage an 
end to fighting," Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said. 
  The government "reiterates its support" for peace 
initiatives 
in the region, particularly that of Tanzania, and calls on the 
"actors on the Rwandan stage to face up to their 
responsibilities" and "end the massacres," he said. [passage

  [Text] Paris, May 5 (AFP) -- President Francois Mitterrand 
said Thursday [5 May] that France could not consider rejoining 
NATO's integrated command because it wanted to keep its 
independent nuclear deterrent. 
  "For the moment, French nuclear weapons are not at 
everyone's 
disposal, they are under sole French control," the socialist 
president said in an address at the presidential palace to 
French military and civilian officials. 
  Mitterrand said control of the nuclear weapons could not be 
handed over to an international authority, adding that he stood 
by the late president Charles de Gaulle's 1966 decision to pull 
out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's integrated 
command. 
  "I firmly maintain this decision. Nohing will make me change 
it," Mitterrand said. 
  Referring to the "tragic solitude of those who have the 
power 
to decide," the president said that the decision to use nuclear 
weapons must rest with the head of state because of the short 
time available to "respond to a threat of aggression." 
  Mitterrand spoke after he and his conservative government 
adopted a bill setting out French defence options for the next 
six years. 
  His audience Thursday included Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur and Defence Minister Francois Leotard. 
  The head of state and the government disagreed on two issues 
-- whether or not to resume nuclear testing at Mururoa in the 
Pacific and the fate of nuclear weapons buried in silos on the 
Albion plateau in southeastern France. 
  Mitterrand opposes resumption of nuclear testing, favoured 
by 
the right, and wants to keep the Albion site operational. 
  Much of the governing right-wing coalition wants to abandon 
strategic missiles in favour of airborne nuclear weapons. 
France also has nuclear missile-armed submarines.

  [Text] France will not resume its nuclear tests even after 
1995. This sentence, uttered by Francois Mitterrand at the 
Elysee [office of the president], sounds like a promise, a 
determination and a political testament. The head of state this 
afternoon extended an invitation to all French officials 
concerned with defense affairs and nuclear issues. Addressing 
his guests, among whom were Defense Minister Francois Leotard 
and the chiefs-of-staff of the three armed services, the 
president, standing between the French and European flags, thus 
made the promise that nuclear tests would no longer be carried 
out in France: 
  [Begin Mitterrand recording] No other tests will take place 
before May 1995, that is before a year from now. I know that a 
good dialectician...[pauses] It is said that this is not very 
important because this decision is not dangerous if taken within 
a year; the decision will be taken as soon as Mitterrand is 
gone! Let me say this to you, ladies and gentlemen: Nobody will 
do it after me! Nobody will do it, unless of course, another 
nuclear power starts its tests. I have already said that we 
will not do it because France would not like to see the French 
people and the whole world come to harm by re-launching a 
nuclear arms race, thus holding the third world and all the poor 
countries up to ridicule. Nor would France like to be the 
country that puts nuclear war on the map again. [end recording].

  [Text] [Excerpts] Paris, May 6 (AFP) -- The question of 
whether to continue with nuclear tests is a "major point of 
disagreement" between the conservative French government and 
socialist President Francois Mitterrand, Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe said on French radio Friday. [passage omitted] 
  Juppe, responding on France-Inter radio, said the issue was 
"a major point of disagreement" with the government, which wants 
to keep its options open. [passage omitted] 
  As for computer-generated tests, "most experts think further 
nuclear tests are needed" before this was possible," he added. 
  A conservative member of parliament's defence committee used 
stronger language, saying Friday that Mitterrand was making a 
"vain testament, a farewell to arms" rather than showing a 
"vision of the future." 
  The president "remains strangely faithful to an outmoded 
vision of the bipolar world of the Cold War, without taking 
account of the new unpredictable dangers which we should defend 
ourselves against," said Jacques Baumel, from the ruling 
coalition party Rassemblement pour la Republique (RPR). 
  Juppe said he agreed with the broad thrust of the 
president's 
arguments. 
  This was that it was vital to French interests to maintain 
an 
independent nuclear deterrent and keep out of NATO's military 
command, to allocate more money to computer research and 
strengthen overall disarmament, he said. 
  "There is no question today of rejoining the military 
organisation" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, said 
Juppe, who said development of computer simulation "will allow 
us to move on from nuclear tests one day." [passage omitted] 
  Mitterrand also gave the first-ever official details of his 
country's nuclear arsenal, saying France had some 500 nuclear 
warheads. 
  The deterrent relied mainly on five nuclear-powered 
submarines which each carried 16 missiles with six independently 
targeted warheads. The number in service at any one time was 64 
missiles, carrying a total of 384 warheads, each of 150 
kilotonnes yield, Mitterrand said.

  [Excerpts] The topic everyone is discussing this morning is 
the one which Francois Mitterrand has just relaunched concerning 
nuclear testing. At the Elysee [office of the president] 
yesterday the head of state in fact expressed great firmness 
over the costs, reaffirming his opposition to any resumption of 
nuclear testing. The statement has been well received by the 
Left, but criticized by the Right. [passage omitted] 
  Without being totally opposed to the head of state, [Foreign 
Minister] Alain Juppe is less convinced: the refusal to resume 
testing threatens the entire nuclear deterrent system, the 
foreign minister believes: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] We need a credible and adequate 
deterrent force. It exists today; will it exist in 10 years' 
time? We are not certain of that, because it has to be 
modernized, and in order to modernize it many experts, in fact 
most experts, consider that further nuclear testing will be 
necessary, before computer simulation makes it possible for us 
to do without it. The president of the Republic has taken up a 
position. That is his right, no one contests his position as 
head of the Armed Forces up until the end of his mandate. But 
he cannot anticipate what his successor will do. It is for the 
future president of the Republic in May 1995 to explain to the 
French people what his concept of the matter is. [end recording] 
  That was Alain Juppe, who was the guest of Annette Ardisson 
just now at 0820 on France-Inter.

"Arms: French Industrialists Lose Ground in Taiwan"] 
  [Text] After selling frigates and armed Mirage 2000-5 
planes to Taiwan, French arms manufacturers have been losing 
ground with the Taipei Government for several months. Last 
January, they had to suffer France's diplomatic about-face, 
pledging to stop selling arms to Taiwan in order to normalize 
its relations with Beijing. At the same time a political and 
legal scandal -- which is beginning to spread -- broke out on 
the island against a background of arms purchases in which the 
French were involved. 
  The highly official LES ECHOS DE LA REPUBLIQUE DE CHINE is 
opening its columns to this mysterious case. It all started 
last December with the murder of Captain Yin Chin-feng, involved 
in the purchase of arms abroad for the Taiwan Government. The 
Taiwanese publication, which on this occasion mentioned "a case 
of bribes and secret military sales," has no hesitation in 
naming a French enterprise: "The main suspect is a man called 
Wang Chuan-Pu who was acting as local agent for several foreign 
firms including the Thomson company." 
  Questioned on this subject, Alain Gomez' group said it was 
"not involved in this case in any way." Although the Taiwanese 
publication stalled by stressing that "Wang was not Thomson's 
legal representative, but a mere intermediary and nothing so far 
suggests that the French company was involved in Captain Yin's 
death," it is not impossible that this case, stirred up by 
internal score-settling between the Taiwanese Government and the 
opposition might have helped to curb Thomson's chances of arming 
the frigates sold as empty hulls in 1991. All the experts agree 
that the position of French industrialists in Taiwan has been 
considerably weakened. 
<H5>  Some Means of Pressure </H5>
  Aside from the simple news item, it is more generally the 
issue of Franco-Taiwanese relations which is now in question. 
The publication of the article in LES ECHOS DE LA REPUBLIQUE DE 
CHINE, intended for a French readership, came just a few days 
after Edouard Balladur's visit to the PRC. However, although 
the Taipei Government reacted with moderation to the snub of the 
Franco-Chinese joint communique of 12 January, it was 
nonetheless angered by its content. And the public discussion 
of this case is now probably a means of reminding the French 
Government of its existence and showing it that it has some 
means of pressure. "Captain Yin was murdered after threatening 
to reveal the misappropriation of funds he had discovered in the 
awarding of arms contracts," the Taiwanese publication explained. 
  Strangely enough, this case is being publicly discussed at a 
time when the U.S. Congress is authorizing Bill Clinton to 
increase arms sales to Taiwan. The blow seems particularly 
harsh for French arms manufacturers because the latter, 
encouraged by the Defense Ministry which is still in favor of 
selling "defensive" weapons, still hope to sell Taiwan some of 
the equipment for the frigates, armored vehicles and air defense 
missiles.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F>
Dino Frescobaldi in Geneva; date not given: "My United Nations 
Has Not Failed"; -- first two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Geneva -- What is the UN secretary general's reply 
to those who are now putting that international organization in 
the dock? To those who have even called for his resignation? 
We dined on Chinese delicacies with Butrus-Ghali in one of the 
three restaurants of the hotel that stands between the lake and 
the now famous Palace of Nations in Geneva. It was one of his 
rare moments of relaxation in an extremely busy working day. 
  "To start with," Butrus-Ghali began, "the fact that I have 
disagreements with important members of the United Nations 
proves that I am independent and that I try to defend the 
organization's independence and specificity. The United Nations 
is criticized now, but it could not be so before, because it did 
not do anything. We are dealing now with 17 different 
operations worldwide. We have no less than 70,000 troops, and 
our peacekeeping budget has increased from $500 to $4 billion. 
We have increased our activities tenfold. We deal not only with 
conflicts but also with a large number of issues, from the 
environment to health and education. We also deal with the 
democratization process and elections. We sent 2,600 observers 
to South Africa to monitor the elections, and we have been 
working with the local police there since 1992 to contain the 
violence. Of course, we have encountered difficulties in some 
areas, but we have also achieved some successes, as in Cambodia, 
El Salvador, and Mozambique, on the basis of the agreement 
reached in Italy. Even in Somalia we have succeeded in training 
personnel for a police force and in vaccinating 300,000 
children. Let us not forget that 2 million people died in 
Biafra. In Somalia, however, we saved 200,000 children. People 
say that we have failed in Yugoslavia. It is not true: We have 
established a cease-fire between Croats and Serbs in Krajina, 
have helped two million refugees, and have transported millions 
of metric tons of food to Sarajevo. For the first time in the 
history of the United Nations, we have sent troops where there 
is no war -- to Macedonia, within the context of preventive 
diplomacy. It must not be expected that all the operations in 
which the United Nations intervenes must necessarily succeed. 
  [Frescobaldi] Perhaps people's opinions are influenced by 
what happened in Somalia.... 
  [Butrus-Ghali] But everybody should realize now why it was 
so 
difficult there. THE WASHINGTON POST revealed this by 
explaining exactly and at length what happened: There were 
disputes between the various American military chiefs. With 
that happening, we could not impose peace. 
  [Frescobaldi] When you took on your post, did you foresee 
the 
obstacles that you would encounter? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes and no. I was well aware that a new phase 
was beginning in the world, in which we do not yet know what 
rules and new ideas should govern international relations. I 
realized that after the end of the Cold War there was a 
political will on the part of the states to impart a new role to 
the United Nations, but the problem is that the states have not 
yet decided what kind of new role they want it to perform. 
  [Frescobaldi] Are you referring to the only remaining 
superpower? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] That is not true. There is Japan, too. The 
Japanese are divided; we do not know what they want in this 
regard; the public is reluctant to commit itself. I have paid 
three visits to Germany. It is the same there, and the 
responses are the same. And the same goes for Argentina and 
Chile too. If all these states decided to play their part, the 
United Nations really would become an international institution 
with some power. If it is wished to grant it power.... But 
until last January, only 20 of the 184 member states had paid 
their contributions. The United States owes us almost a billion 
dollars. To conclude: There is not the political will on the 
part of the member states to use this instrument. 
  [Frescobaldi] Could you explain? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] First explanation: Many do not yet know what 
the post-Cold War ground rules are. Second, for some states, 
such as America and Russia, it was easy to obtain billions from 
their citizens when there was a clear and specific enemy. Now 
it is much more difficult to achieve a mobilization, when the 
danger is spread round the world. Third, people were prepared 
to die to defend their own territory, but now they are no longer 
prepared to take part in remote operations under a strange flag 
in order to defend other people's peace. 
  [Frescobaldi] Will we reach the establishment of a UN army? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I have never been in favor of it. It would 
entail creating a bureaucracy. What would we do with the 
generals if there were no wars? What I am asking the states to 
do is to have ready a special contingent to be made available 
within 24-48 hours -- a contingent that would return to its own 
ranks once the operation is over. I have proposed a contract to 
Italy to make available, if necessary, five transport aircraft 
belonging to the Italian Armed Forces. I do not doubt that some 
situations would have been resolved if it had been possible to 
intervene within the space of a few days. For instance, I have 
no doubt that if we could have sent 5,000 men to Rwanda within 
48 hours, we would have resolved matters. Now it is taking 
months of exhausting negotiations to decide who will take 
command and to create expedition corps among people that you do 
not know and that change their minds at the last minute. 
  [Frescobaldi] Have these delays also had an impact on the 
situation in Bosnia? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I will tell you in this regard that last June 
I asked to have an additional 10,000 men available. In fact, on 
the basis of a study, I said that 35,000 more men were needed. 
They told me: We will give you 10,000, and that is all. The 
fact is that hitherto I have not managed to secure even these. 
  [Frescobaldi] Did you address Italy, too, in connection with 
Yugoslavia, even though it is a bordering state? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] We are in such serious trouble that I 
eventually asked even Italy to participate. Of course, in 
Italy's case there is a danger of reviving old memories, but in 
the present situation it is a lesser danger. I made a choice 
between the two dangers. We cannot do without the quality of 
the Italian troops belonging to NATO, who possess the same 
weapons as the other contingents. 
  [Frescobaldi] What was Italy's reply? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] We did not receive a reply; we waited, then 
we 
asked again. We were told that it would be necessary to await 
the election results, and now we have to wait for the new 
government. This is an example. But Italy is not the only 
instance. In Germany they told me that they have constitutional 
problems. So I sent a delegation to the Constitutional Court. 
I then had three hours of discussions with the Bundestag 
Foreign Affairs Committee. For the same reason I have already 
visited Japan twice, and I will go there a third time. All this 
takes up endless time. 
  [Frescobaldi] Do you think that an end to the Yugoslav 
tragedy is possible? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Ethnic war is like a contagious illness that 
spreads and propagates itself. I believe that the United 
Nations has already achieved a great deal by containing the war 
in Bosnia and by preventing it from extending beyond 
Yugoslavia's borders. As for the rest, that will take a long 
time. Unfortunately, I cannot fail to draw a parallel with 
Lebanon. It is difficult to end a tragic process when it has 
claimed so many lives. Beirut too was an important center -- no 
less so than Sarajevo. It was a banking center, a cultural 
center with four universities, a center of information with the 
shaykhs' residences and oil interests. And yet that war has 
lasted 14 years.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F>
Sa'id Sunbul in New York on 20 April] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Sunbul] To be honest with 
you, the public in the Arab and Islamic worlds in particular was 
under the impression that the UN secretary general would play a 
more effective role in ending the war in Bosnia. However, the 
war there rages on. It has not ended despite the passage of two 
years. What are the reasons? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I would like to clarify one important fact 
which many might have missed. This fact is that I, in my 
capacity as UN secretary general, do not command a combat army 
that I can use to intervene and end all wars raging around the 
world. I also do not have the power to impose peace on a 
conflict between two countries. What I can do is intervene to 
end wars and conflicts and convince the warring parties to stop 
their wars and accept peace. 
  I am sad and sorry about what is happening in Bosnia. I have 
done all I can in the past two years to defend the Bosnian 
people and protect them from Serbian aggression. However, the 
issue is not in my hands as much as it is in the hands of the 
member countries, in particular the big powers. 
  Over the past two years, I have not stopped my contacts with 
the various countries to recruit more forces to send to Bosnia 
to protect the people there. I have also visited many donor 
countries in an attempt to convince them to provide more aid to 
the international forces in Bosnia. The mission of these forces 
is to protect the Bosnian people. 
  In June last year, I asked the countries to increase the 
number of international forces in Bosnia. However, they did not 
respond to my request. I am still making this demand. 
  The United Nations might realize some successes in some 
areas 
and failures in others. This success or failure does not depend 
on the United Nations itself as an organ, but on the member 
countries, and in particular the countries influential in 
decisionmaking. The United Nations is merely a mirror 
reflecting the stand of its member countries. 
  To this fact, we must add another fact, which is that the 
United Nations is made up of 184 members representing various 
economic, political, and geographic groupings. Despite this 
fact, decisionmaking within this international organization 
continues to be restricted to a very limited sphere. The 
remaining member countries, with all their potentials and 
resources put together, were not able to influence this sphere 
or infiltrate it. This, certainly, weakens the United Nations 
and the secretary general. If some countries had wanted to, 
they would have been able to change the course of events during 
the past two years. Unfortunately, they did not want to. 
  I am not saying this in order to remove the blame from the 
United Nations or its secretary general. My objective is to 
make some countries take action, in particular those countries 
that have potential, resources, and political and diplomatic 
expertise in order to enlarge the decisionmaking base. Thus, 
international justice can be achieved and decisions will become 
democratic. [passage omitted] 
  [Sunbul] It has been noticed that the current UN secretary 
general is being subjected to a strong campaign of criticism, 
unlike any previous UN secretary general. How do you explain 
this phenomenon? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] (laughing) This is true, and the reason, in 
my 
opinion, is that conditions around the world currently are very 
different from what they were before, during the Cold War years. 
  During the Cold War, there were two superpowers, the United 
States and the Soviet Union. They controlled all the strings. 
They used to make the final decisions on all stands and crises. 
Given this, the role of the United Nations was a secondary one. 
  After the Cold War, the whole picture and the situation 
changed. The world entered a new age, the post-Cold War age. In 
view of these new conditions, the United Nations acquired a more 
effective role. In these post-Cold War times, numerous racial 
and regional conflicts erupted. All eyes focused on the United 
Nations asking for its help. In the past, the UN peacekeeping 
forces were concentrated in two countries. Now, they are spread 
out in 17 countries. The United Nations has become a party in 
many conflicts. Thus, some parties are happy and others are 
angry. This is why the secretary general is being criticized 
more fiercely. In actual fact, it is criticism directed at the 
United Nations as an international organ more than at the 
secretary general as a person. 
  [Sunbul] I have one last question to ask you. I would like 
to go back to the subject of Bosnia and ask you what the 
solution is. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] There is no way out unless the big powers, 
headed by the United States, want to intervene and use their 
power and potential as they did during the crisis between Iraq 
and Kuwait. 
  So long as the big powers are not ready to enter the battle, 
and so long as the countries that have the potential do not want 
to intervene and are satisfied with mere expressions of anger, 
the difficult situation in Bosnia will, unfortunately, continue 
and increase.

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- General George A. Joulwan, NATO 
supreme allied commander Europe, backs a diplomatic solution for 
solving the Bosnia crisis. In any case, it is up to the United 
Nations and not NATO to decide on procedures and actions in the 
Balkans, the U.S. four-star general told BERLINER MORGENPOST. 
  Joulwan rejected the view that NATO is doing too little in 
Bosnia. After all, the alliance is monitoring the flight ban 
over Bosnia as well as deploying ships to ensure an effective 
embargo imposed on rump Yugoslavia. In addition, NATO has 
16,000 troops in Bosnia under U.N. command.

  [Text] The first day of the Croat-Bosniak negotiations on 
the implementation of the Washington agreement ended this 
evening in the American Embassy in Vienna. Tihomir Vinkovic 
reports: 
  [Vinkovic] We discussed all open issues, Croatian Foreign 
Minister Granic said, and added that the talks will be resumed 
tomorrow at 1000 [0800 GMT] I believe that we will successfully 
complete the negotiations tomorrow evening or on Monday morning 
[9 May] at the latest, Minister Granic said. 
  Asked if the Muslims persisted in their demand that both the 
president of the federation and the prime minister be Muslim, 
Kresimir Zubak, the Croat representative from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, said: Yes, but they also have some new 
ideas. 
  It has been learned that no names were discussed today, only 
the principles of the Washington agreement, that is, which post 
will be held by the representative of which nation. 
  After the talks, Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic briefly said that the talks were constructive and held 
in a good atmosphere. 
  We might find out tomorrow whether these statements hide 
optimism or just the usual diplomatic vocabulary.

  [Text] Brussels, May 6 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
said here Friday [6 May] that it was eager to help the new 
government of South Africa to establish "a democratic and 
nonracial society." 
  Theodoros Pangalos, Greek chairman of the EU's Council of 
Ministers, said the Union was ready to embark on an economic and 
political dialogue with the new government aimed at quickly 
boosting economic trade and aid. 
  "The EU warmly welcomes the holding of the first democratic 
elections in South Africa and congratulates all the people of 
South Africa and its leaders on this historic occasion," he said 
at a meeting of development aid ministers. 
  Pangalos added the EU's confidence that all parties in South 
Africa would meet the commitments they made during negotiations 
leading up to last week's all-race elections, and would pursue 
peaceful dialogue.

  [Text] Brussels, May 6 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] is 
to send a mission to countries fringing Rwanda in order to study 
the plight of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees 
displaced by civil war, the EU said here Friday [6 May]. 
  Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek chairman of the EU's Council

of Greece, Germany and Belgium, the current and immediate future 
and past presidents of the Union. 
  Speaking after a meeting of EU ministers of development 
cooperation, he said the Union was also trying to broker a 
dialogue between the parties to the civil war in Rwanda which 
has reportedly claimed up to 200,000 lives. 
  Belgian Development Minister Eric Derijcke said the EU was 
also trying to put pressure on the Organisation of African Unity 
into playing a more active role in the search for peace in 
Rwanda.

<F P=106> [Wouter Dambre video report] </F>
  [Text] NIRAS, the national office for radioactive waste and 
enriched nuclear fuels, will soon be responsible for two new 
plants, costing 4.5 billion Belgian francs, half of which is to 
be paid by electricity producers. The plants include a central 
processing unit for low-radioactive waste and a storage place 
for medium- and high-radioactive waste. 
  [Begin recording] [Dambre] Here is CILVA, the central 
infrastructure for low-radioactive solid waste. It is a highly 
modern plant where low-radioactive waste is processed. The 
waste comes mainly from nuclear plants, hospitals, and 
laboratories. Belgo-Process, the industrial subsidiary of 
NIRAS, will simultaneously take delivery of the processing unit 
at the end of May. 
  [NIRAS General Director Decamps] This is a unique project in 
Belgium, and also in Europe. It is the most up-to-date plant of 
this type for the processing of low-radioactive waste. The 
waste is processed in such a way so as to confine the 
radioactivity in a safe container. 
  [Dambre] Containers with low-radioactive waste are 
compressed 
by a hydraulic press to reduce the volume of the waste. What is 
left goes into large casks in which concrete is cast. The 
radiation thus stays inside. Each year 250 tons of 
low-radioactive waste also can be burnt here. The ashes are 
then refined, compressed, and end up in containers in which a 
layer of concrete is cast. 
  NIRAS also has built a new storage place for 
high-radioactive 
waste. Starting in 1995, the nuclear waste from spent fuel from 
Belgian nuclear plants will end up here. 
  [Decamps] The waste will have to be stored here at least 40 
to 50 years until it possibly can be stored, for example, in 
clay layers deep in the sea. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Democrats Predicts Difficulty in </F>
Forming `Purple' Government"] 
  [Text] D66 [Democrats 66] leader Van Mierlo predicted that 
the creation of a "purple" government comprising the D66, the 
PvdA [Labor Party], and the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy] will be "an extremely delicate and difficult 
operation, full of difficulties." Van Mierlo said this Thursday 
[5 May] following the first meeting in Amsterdam of the new 
24-member group. 
  The D66 had already made it clear during the election 
campaign that it would try to put together a "purple" coalition. 
However, now that the party has become the fourth largest, 
behind the VVD, it is more difficult for the D66 to serve as a 
bridge between the PvdA and the VVD. "It is easier to build a 
bridge between the PvdA and the VVD if you are in between," Van 
Mierlo said. 
  The D66 leader, who yesterday was provisionally elected 
floor 
leader, did not want to reveal anything about the way in which 
the D66 aims to achieve its goal. "The D66's scenario is to 
serve the achievement of the goal: A `purple' coalition. I am 
not holding anything back as far as that is concerned. However, 
if you want to know about strategy, how we are going to get 
where we want to go, then I would say this: That is rather 
delicate, and will have to remain secret for now."

Trading With Libya"] 
  [Excerpt] Eurabic International, based in Hoofddorp, has 
again been caught possibly engaged in banned trading with Libya. 
The U.S. Justice Department suspects the company of supplying 
Libya with computer software. This would be an infringement of 
the U.S. [as published] trade embargo imposed on Libya. 
  Eurabic is well-known to Western intelligence services as a 
front for the Libyan Government. Netherlands Intelligence 
believes that the firm is controlled directly from Tripoli and 
attempts to acquire a variety of goods which are no longer 
available through normal channels due to the trade embargo. 
  Eurabic was founded by B. Rhuma, former head of the 
Netherlands office of Libyan Arab Airlines, the Libyan state 
airline. The U.S. Justice Department has long been interested 
in the affairs of Eurabic. In the past, Libya has purchased 
items including aircraft components and chemicals from the firm.

  [Text] Scores of Britons escaping the civil war in Yemen 
flew back home today, leaving another 700 behind. 
  The Foreign Office said up to 150 more wanted to leave and 
it 
was now working out how to evacuate them via the airport in the 
capital Sanaa, which is effectively closed. 
  "Probably about 100 have got out now through various means. 
We are now looking at about 100 to 150 who would still like to 
come out," said a Foreign Office [FO] spokesman. 
  "We will probably try to get a civilian airliner in over the 
next day or so to fly out from Sanaa," he said. "No definite 
decision has been made yet but we are likely to press ahead if 
the situation remains calm enough." 
  Option B, he said, was to launch a military evacuation. 
  Fighting broke out after the failure of efforts to unite the 
old states of North and South Yemen. The situation in Sanaa was 
relatively calm and British diplomats there report "no great 
state of panic" among those left behind, said the FO spokesman. 
Otherwise, steps to evacuate them would be "more drastic." 
  Today, around 42 Britons -- mainly administration workers 
for 
the Canadian Occidental Petroleum company in the former southern 
capital of Aden, and their dependents -- flew back into Stansted 
airport, Essex, on a flight from the Red Sea port of Djibouti at 
6:30am today. They had been taken to Djibouti from Yemen by a 
French warship. 
  Several evacuees expressed their relief at being back home 
to 
BBC News. One man said: "I went out on to the balcony and saw 
flashes of light and explosions coming up from the airport and 
it was at that point that I thought: `This is it.'" 
  Another said: "We were in a compound not 100 yards from the 
airport and there were bullets flying all over the place." 
  A spokesman from Canadian Occidental said of the evacuees: 
"They were nervous about the situation in Aden but they were in 
all in very good shape. Nobody was injured." 
  Britons were among their staff remaining behind in Yemen, 
but 
they were working in the oil fields away from the fighting, he 
said. 
  Other British evacuees are said to have arrived on a flight 
laid on by the oil company Yemeni Hunt into Stansted and on an 
Air France flight into London's Heathrow airport.

<F P=106> [By Heather Tyrrell, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Text] The Foreign Office is planning to evacuate around 
150 Britons from the capital of war-ravaged Yemen on a civilian 
airliner tomorrow -- if fighting allows. 
  The final go-ahead for a British Airways [BA] plane will be 
based on a "minute-by-minute" assessment of the safety by 
British diplomatic staff in the capital Sanaa, said a Foreign 
Office spokesman. 
  If it is not deemed safe, military planes will be sent in 
later to evacuate them, he said. 
  Around 700 Britons remain in the Arab country, five days 
into 
the civil war, and around 150 of them want to leave, he said. 
  Some 100 Britons have already left the country -- many 
helped 
by the French navy or the U.S. airforce to the safety of 
Djibouti or Riyadh, where they have caught flights home to the 
UK. 
  Scores arrived back today and spoke of land and air battles 
between Marxists in the south and the conservative and tribal 
North, which have included Scud missile attacks. 
  One evacuee told BBC News: "I went out on to the balcony and 
saw flashes of light and explosions coming up from the airport 
and it was at that point that I thought: `This is it.'" 
  Another said: "We were in a compound not 100 yards from the 
airport and there were bullets flying all over the place." 
  A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are hoping to get a 
British Airways [BA] flight in tomorrow but we will not know 
until hours before -- we will do a minute-by-minute assessment 
from our Embassy. It is our hope and our intention to try and 
get one. If that fails, we will have to revert to a military 
option." Hercules transport planes from RAF Lyneham are 
available if necessary. 
  The airport in Sanaa has been effectively closed, but 
attacks 
seem to quieten during daylight hours, and banks, businesses, 
schools and restaurants in the city are open. 
  A BA spokesman has said that the airline has a plane on 
stand-by and is waiting for the go-ahead from the Foreign Office. 
  "We would need assurances from the Foreign Office that it is 
safe to fly in and fly out," he said. 
  The flight would pick up the remaining Britons who wanted to 
leave, and the 14-member crew of a British Airways DC-10 who 
flew into Sanaa last Tuesday [3 May]. 
  Evacuee Wendy Carlick, 38, of Wickham Market, Suffolk, was 
critical of the lack of a British evacuation when she flew into 
Heathrow today, leaving her husband Brian, 44, behind in Yemen. 
  She was accepted on one of four U.S. military flights from 
Sanaa to Saudi Arabia, after spending two nights in the basement 
of the home of her husband's boss at the communications firm 
Cable and Wireless. She was joined by evacuee Mrs. Kim Lee, of 
Plymouth, Devon, and her two children Andrew, four, and Thomas, 
seven today, the family of her husband's work colleague. 
  "The British Embassy has not done a thing to help us. Kim's 
husband David took it upon himself to do something and said if 
there's going to be an evacuation, we should try and get on it," 
said Mrs. Carlick. 
  "If the United States could do it, why couldn't the British? 
Even if there was not going to be any more danger, there has 
been enough. Their feeling was `Let's wait and see for 24 
hours.' Our feeling was: `Get out as soon as you can while the 
runway is still OK.'" 
  She was among the last 10 to be accepted on the flight, she 
said. 
  The first they had known about the civil war was at dawn on 
Thursday, she said. 
  "Three jets came over extremely low and dropped three bombs. 
We heard the jets, the bombs and immediately the anti-aircraft 
missiles going off. We were terrified. Me and my husband 
crawled along the floor and hid under the stairs. We live 
opposite a military base so the bullets were very close. They 
went on for half an hour. We decided to go to our general 
manager's house who had a big basement and for two days we made 
home there." Sanaa now had no power, water or petrol, she said. 
  At home now with her daughter Tammy, 18, and son Matthew, 
16, 
Mrs. Carlick said: "I am relieved to be here but still very, 
very anxious."

  [Text] Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams is to visit Spain's 
Basque region next week. 
  Mr. Adams, who arrives in Spain on Monday [9 May] for a 
three-day visit, is to have talks with Herri Batasuna (HB), the 
political arm of the separatist group ETA [Basque Fatherland and 
Liberty]. 
  One of the Basque region's MEPs [member of European 
Parliament] was in Belfast two months ago when he met Sinn Fein 
members. 
  A Sinn Fein spokesman confirmed tonight: "He is going to 
talk 
about the peace process and to explain to people there what is 
happening in Ireland. He has accepted a number of invitations." 
  Mr. Adams, who was in America earlier this year, is now 
fighting through the courts seeking to have an exclusion order 
banning him from Britain lifted. 
  Basque media and HB members said the visit was an historic 
encounter between two independent movements. 
  "Relations between the Irish and Basque people and between 
Sinn Fein and Batasuna is based on mutual solidarity for the 
fight that both peoples carry out for self-determination and 
independence."

<F P=106> [Peter Almond report: "Britain Will Help To Rebuild Forces"] </F>
  [Text] British military trainers are due in South Africa 
soon to help build the new multi-ethnic armed forces. 
  The trainers, led by a brigadier and including three RAF 
[Royal Air Force] members, are part of an expected expansion of 
Britain's military and commercial ties with South Africa. 
British contractors are ready to strike deals in avionics, 
shipbuilding and technical training. 
  British security interests are expected to increase 
significantly throughout southern Africa; military trainers are 
already working in several countries in the region and Mr 
Mandela, the President-elect, has indicated that South Africa 
might return to the Commonwealth. 
  South African and British officials regard the appointment 
of 
Mr Joe Modise as South African Defence Minister as indicating 
that Mr Mandela intends to maintain a strong defence force which 
could help the United Nations throughout southern Africa. 
  South African officials suggest the renewal of military 
links 
with Britain would be at the expense of Pretoria's ties with 
Israel, which has helped maintain South Africa's high-technology 
weapons industries. 
  South Africa is making a determined effort to sell Britain 
its new Rooivalk attack helicopter. The Ministry of Defence has 
allowed the Rooivalk to be officially entered as another serious 
contender, along with American and European firms, for a 1 
billion pound contract for up to 91 helicopters. 
  It will be demonstrated in Britain for the first time this 
week at the Army Air Corps air show at Middle Wallop, Hants.

<F P=106> [Christy Campbell report: "European Defence Links To </F>
Replace NATO"] 
  [Text] Foreign Office officials are working on plans to 
promote closer co-operation on defence and security between 
Britain and Europe. The aim is to replace a defence policy 
based on NATO, and relying on American support, with a more 
pan-European approach. 
  The Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, is strongly behind the 
change of emphasis and is understood to be seeking more 
aggressive promotion of joint European defence projects after 
next month's European elections. Britain is already committed 
to more joint ventures under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, 
and an accelerating American withdrawal from Europe is now 
thought to be inevitable. 
  However, Euro-sceptic Tory back-benchers are alarmed by the 
new approach, which was reflected strongly in the recent Defence 
White Paper. They believe it will jeopardise British 
sovereignty and could put British security under European 
control. 
  Ian Duncan-Smith, Conservative MP for Chingford, claimed 
last 
night he had wide backbench support for the challenge he is 
planning to force ministers to come clean on what he described 
as a "hidden agenda." 
  The White Paper states: "While defence and security policies 
are likely to retain specifically British elements with an 
ability for national action...the multilateral dimension will 
increasingly influence our judgment." 
  Mr Duncan-Smith called this an admission that national 
sovereignty over defence was effectively being put up for grabs 
by Brussels. "It is an extraordinary statement -- a huge shift 
of policy, which has neither been debated in the House of 
Commons nor in the party," he said. 
  The defence document concentrates heavily on British 
security 
in the European context -- while admitting that "significant 
reductions in the costs of the defence programme" will be 
announced as soon as possible. 
  The results of a defence cost study ordered by Malcolm 
Rifkind, Secretary of State for Defence, will be published in 
July. It will present radical proposals to privatise support 
services involving as many as 20,000 Government job losses. 
  There will be heated squabbles over cuts in military bands 
and regimental mascots, but an underlying shift in global 
security policy could cause a much bigger political storm. 
  "It's a dual track," said Mr Duncan-Smith. "The Government 
is dressing up real cuts in our fighting capability while 
claiming the front line will not be touched. At the same time 
we are galloping into European defence agreements. The two are 
clearly linked." 
  Julian Brazier, vice-chairman of the Conservative backbench 
defence committee, said he was more concerned about the cuts' 
effect on Britain's true fighting capability. 
  "The Army is being crushed by ever-expanding peacetime 
commitments and cuts in resources," he said. "Anything that 
might weaken the transatlantic connection would be a fatal 
mistake."

  [Editorial Report] Recent Kurdish protests in 
Germany--including blockading highways with burning tires and 
cars--have highlighted the extension of Turkey's conflict with 
the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) to Germany and prompted the 
German press and politicians to take sides. Although German 
media commentary condemned the Turkish campaign and applauded 
Bonn's decision to halt temporarily arms deliveries to Turkey, 
the press has been more ambivalent and divided on the legitimacy 
of Kurdish protests in Germany and Bonn's right to deport those 
responsible. Turkish television and print media, appearing more 
concerned with the overall state of German-Turkish relations, 
mostly downplayed the Kurdish protests in Germany and reported 
on the incidents without comment. One exception, however, was 
the widely respected daily MILLIYET of 24 March, which carried a 
frontpage report with the headline "The German Hatred Toward the 
PKK." Turkish commentary on the temporary embargo on German 
weapons sales was circumspect. 
<H5>  German Opinion Split on Kurdish Demonstrations </H5>
  The center-right press, although it does not support the 
Turkish campaign against Kurdish separatists, has roundly 
condemned the Kurdish protests in Germany, which some 
commentators claim have been spurred on by the German left wing. 
A front page commentary in the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE on 5 
April declared that the Kurds had overstepped the limits of 
hospitality: "Turkey must settle its minority problem itself. 
If they attempt this by abusing human rights, the Federal 
Republic will give those affected refuge under the condition 
that a fire not be ignited here that will be fueled by conflicts 
in the homeland." Two other articles in the 3 April DIE WELT AM 
SONNTAG and the 28 March weekly FOCUS took a very unsympathetic 
view of the PKK, detailing the claim that the organization 
finances itself through drug deals and extortions of Kurds 
living in Germany. Several media commentaries claimed that 
German left-wing support for the Kurds encourages protest 
actions. FOCUS noted that "Kurdish groups are uncritically 
supported by elements of the German left wing. ...when the 
Kurds unroll red PKK flags at demonstrations, German 
antifascists and militant Greens are not far away." Almuth 
Baron claimed in a 30 March FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE commentary 
that "the sometimes naive enthusiasm for Kurds in Germany makes 
it possible for Kurdish organizations to organize themselves 
better." 
  The leftist dailies, in particular DIE TAGESZEITUNG and 
NEUES 
DEUTSCHLAND, have shown sympathy for the Kurds, strongly 
condemning the Turkish Government's campaign in Kurdistan and 
speaking of a double standard applied to the Kurds in Germany. 
These papers stressed that German weapons sales to Turkey have 
made Germany a legitimate target for Kurdish attacks. In a 
commentary in the 24 March TAGESZEITUNG, Jurgen Gottschlich, who 
has written several commentaries on the issue, asserted that: 
"The Federal Republic is embroiled in the dirty war in 
Kurdistan. Therefore the demonstrations in the Federal Republic 
are not a misuse of the privileges of guests, but legitimate 
protest that is directed to the right address." Similarly, a 
commentary in NEUES DEUTSCHLAND on 29 March claimed that "with 
weapons deliveries, Chancellor Helmut Kohl is supporting the 
terrorism of the Turkish Army against the Kurds." In an article 
on 25 March entitled "[Interior Minister Manfred] Kanther 
Militant, Kurds Peaceful," a TAGESZEITUNG commentator made the 
inflammatory assertion that the Turkish Government desired a 
"final solution" to the Kurdish problem. Both newspapers 
deplored the German Government's double standard toward Kurdish 
demonstrators. Gottschlich, in his TAGESZEITUNG commentary, 
charged that when German workers blocked highways, it was 
regarded as a legitimate attempt to express grievances; but when 
Kurdish protestors did the same thing, it was labeled "terror in 
a new dimension," and they were threatened with deportation. 
<H5>  Ambivalence on Deportations </H5>
  Media commentaries have been ambivalent about calls by 
Interior Minister Kanther and other government officials for 
deportation of those Kurds responsible for the demonstrations. 
All commentaries demanded, and most were skeptical about 
receiving, assurances from Turkey that the Kurds would not be 
imprisoned, tortured, or killed upon their return to Turkey. 
For example, Almuth Baron, writing in the 3O March FRANKFURTER 
ALLGEMEINE, acknowledged the danger that the Kurds would be 
punished upon arrival, explaining that "in Turkey everything 
that has to do with the PKK has developed a certain dynamic of 
its own with the security forces." The leftist FRANKFURTER 
RUNDSCHAU, in a 9 April commentary, put it more bluntly: "There 
must be an end to suggestions that Turkey is a country to which 
people can be deported. Anyone committing an offense in Germany 
must be put on trial in Germany and put in German prisons." 
Jurgen Gottschlich claimed in the 5 April TAGESZEITUNG that by 
deporting the Kurds to western Turkey, Germany would be 
contributing to escalation of the Kurdish conflict in that part 
of Turkey, which would "have an effect on relations between 
Turkish and Kurdish immigrants here." He added: "German 
politicians think they have gotten rid of [the Kurdish] problem. 
Instead they have brought it home again." 
<H5>  Reactions to Weapons Embargo </H5>
  After media reports that German weapons were being used by 
the Turkish military against the Kurds and ensuing protests from 
the Left, the German Government announced on 7 April that it was 
instituting a temporary embargo on weapons sales to Turkey until 
it could determine what the weapons were being used for. On 3 
May Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel lifted the embargo, because, 
in the ministry's view, the evidence was not clear that the 
weapons were being used in Kurdistan. The centrist SUEDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG commented on 14 April that the question may be 
irrelevant because "German armament aid was not `Kurd neutral' 
right from the start"; even if German arms were not being used 
in Kurdistan, the deliveries allowed the Turks to redeploy other 
military equipment from other parts of the country to Kurdistan. 
  Turkish commentary on the embargo was notably circumspect, 
emphasizing the importance of German-Turkish relations and the 
need to refrain from overreacting. A commentary in the 9 April 
MILLIYET by respected columnist Sami Kohen called Germany's 
behavior "irreconcilable with the concept of a serious state," 
because it acted "rashly" without verifying allegations. He 
warned, however, that although "we may be angry about the latest 
German decision, ...it is necessary not to overreact and 
especially not to allow a serious crisis with Germany." Kohen 
noted that the greatest value of the embargo is "symbolic," 
perhaps prompting similar actions by other countries that 
provide aid to Turkey, in particular the United States. Echoing 
remarks by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin that the decision was 
not an embargo, Mehmet Ali Birand wrote in the 9 April SABAH 
that the suspension of aid is not that big a problem because 
most of the weapons shipments to Turkey have already been 
delivered: "The German officials have considered placing an 
embargo on the last consignment." He judged that "Germany and 
Turkey need each other...both stand to lose a great deal if we 
disrupt our relations." Turkish reports on the embargo hint 
that it was more a product of German domestic politics than 
anything else. Birand asserts that "the lastest situation on 
arms supplies has been created by the problems in Germany's 
domestic politics," and goes on to point out that the German 
Government faces elections this year.

<F P=106> [Speech by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl at CDU rally in </F>
Aachen to mark the beginning of the European election campaign 
-- live] 
  [Excerpts] Ladies and Gentlemen, we have gathered here in 
the historical square in front of Aachen Cathedral to open the 
election campaign for the European elections on 12 June at this 
first major CDU [Christian Democratic Union] rally. [passage 
omitted] 
  We do not want a centralized European state, in which each 
and every thing is regulated from Brussels; we want a Europe in 
which the peoples are with each other in togetherness, in which 
we as Germans or Belgians, as Dutchmen, Luxembourgers, or 
Frenchmen make our contribution to Europe. We want this Europe 
to be a Europe in which the children born at this hour in Aachen 
take it for granted that they carry their home of Aachen and the 
language of their mothers, their mother-tongue, in them 
throughout their lives -- so that home means what the 
associations of that word are for us Germans: The space in which 
we grew up, the neighbors, our own family, the countryside. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Maastricht Treaty has given us the basis and we will 
continue to develop this treaty over this decade, with more 
rights for the European Parliament, with an assumption of more 
responsibilities and competences, in a (?sensible) way, but not 
in such a way that we want to have a centralist European 
superstate, but so that in a wise way we will develop a federal 
Europe of the kind that we have tested out here in Germany. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen let me say this. This Europe has been 
as successful as it has with the Germans in the last 20 or 30 
years because here in Germany the German mark has grown more and 
more into the leading European currency. The fact that the 
German mark is today, alongside the Japanese yen and the U.S. 
dollar, one of the world's leading currencies is of the greatest 
importance for Germans and Europeans. This is why the following 
statement holds true, and I will continue to say it loud and 
clear, as is stated in the Maastricht Treaty: We will only agree 
to a European currency when this currency is of the same quality 
as the German mark. That is a decisive precondition of our 
policy. [applause] [passage omitted] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, in spite of positive developments in 
the economic sphere, concern about jobs remains. We know from 
our experiences over past years that when the economy is back on 
track and prosperity returns following an economic decline, 
unemployment cannot be reduced overnight, that it takes time for 
the new positive development to take hold fully. For that 
reason the issue of combating unemployment, halting 
unemployment, and creating new jobs remains the paramount task 
for us, for the CDU. But jobs cannot be talked into existence, 
or talked into existence through placards. It must above all be 
insured that the economy is back on track and that companies -- 
not least small- and medium-sized industries -- are capable of 
creating new jobs and hiring people. [passage omitted] 
  The precondition for getting the economy back on its feet, 
and I add this quite frankly, is that following the experiences 
of the economic crisis that is now coming to an end, we do not 
assume we can carry on as before. [passage omitted] We know 
there are hundreds of thousands of citizens, including those who 
have a secure job now, who would quite willingly switch to a 
part-time job. [passage omitted] 
  I am grateful for the fact that in the wage settlements of 
the past few months, especially in the pay settlements for the 
chemical and engineering workers, greater flexibility is now 
finally a reality and we can now adapt to the future in a much 
more dynamic way. That is the point -- the maxim must be to 
secure the future. [passage omitted] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the competition -- thank God, for 
indeed we wish this -- is knocking at our door. We do indeed 
wish to see the successor states of the Soviet Union, namely 
Russia and Ukraine, make progress. We do indeed wish to see the 
rule of law, democracy, and a market economy established. For 
if they do not succeed, if the reforms collapse, and if the old 
structures return, be they military dictatorship or a communist 
regime, then everything is going to be much more expensive than 
at present, and the vicious circle of missiles and rearmament 
will begin all over again. 
  We wish to see peace and freedom prevail in Central, East, 
and southeastern Europe and for their peoples to build their 
lives in a free country. However, that assumes that they build 
up their industries which, to put it bluntly, means that they 
are going to be our competitors. I will be speaking in Mannheim 
tomorrow, in May Square, just a few meters distance from the 
premises of one of the big European companies. This same 
company also has a branch in Brno. Both factories manufacture 
the same product. In Mannheim the hourly rate for a trained 
metalworker is 43 German marks [DM], in Brno DM3. And that is 
not on some far-distant planet but a distance of just a few 
hundred kilometers. These two figures illustrate to anyone how 
the competitive situation is shaping up. 
  Naturally, prices in Brno will rise since prosperity means 
higher wages, and naturally wages in Mannheim cannot be lowered. 
But we must reflect on how to cleverly improve in many ways our 
competitiveness. Anyone who believes that the required standard 
has already been achieved and that one could now rest on one's 
laurels complacently awaiting future developments is betraying 
the future of Germany. Therefore, we from the Union say that we 
must be able to rethink to safeguard our future, and we will do 
everything necessary in this way. [applause] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["C.G."-signed report: "Kinkel: Following the Recent </F>
Decisions, My Position as Chairman Is Strengthened"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 6 May -- Following the coalition statement of 
the leading bodies of the Free Democratic Party [FDP] and his 
differences with North Rhine-Westphalian land chairman Juergen 
Moellemann, FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel said in an interview with 
this newspaper on 6 May: "The FDP has fallen in step again." 
Following the "basic decisions" made in recent weeks, his 
position as chairman had strengthened, he said. This would also 
manifest itself in the Federal Convention and the presidential 
election in Berlin on 23 May. The FDP wanted leadership and 
would get it. Kinkel called the FDP Presidium and Federal 
Executive Board recommendation to the party congress, which will 
be held in Rostock early in June, to continue the Bonn coalition 
with the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union 
[CDU/CSU] following the Bundestag elections in October, a 
"caesura." He said the North Rhine-Westphalian land party 
congress in Dortmund two weeks ago had also been a decisive 
event. At that congress, land chairman Moellemann was reelected 
with a relatively weak result, whereas Kinkel was feted 
ostentatiously. 
  Kinkel said he was pleased with the economic recovery and 
the 
change of mood resulting from it. "I am happy to see that after 
a difficult starting period, things are improving for me, too; I 
feel that the party accepts me." 
<H5>  Support for Hamm-Bruecher </H5>
  Kinkel vehemently contradicted statements that he and group 
chairman Hermann Otto Solms intended to bring their influence to 
bear on the FDP group in the Federal Convention to vote for 
CDU/CSU candidate Roman Herzog on the first ballot. He called 
such claims "nonsense." After each ballot of the Federal 
Convention, the FDP would carefully consider the course of 
events and draw its conclusions: "We will see what the 
situation is in the course of the process, and have a right to 
know what our partners have." Kinkel said he would hold many 
preparatory talks and would then submit his proposal in Berlin. 
He said the FDP supported its candidate, Hildegard 
Hamm-Bruecher, but he did not say whether this also held true 
for the third ballot, in which a relative majority is sufficient 
for the election of the federal president. Kinkel said Mrs. 
Hamm-Bruecher said in the Presidium on 1 May that she would "do 
what the party wants." Kinkel added that "quiet is required 
now." Therefore, he rejected any speculation. In Berlin, he 
would "say clearly what the direction should be -- without, 
however, overrunning the FDP." As he did with his coalition 
statement, he would also "make the final decision" following 
exploratory talks. He said he had invited the FDP land chairmen 
for 21 May. Kinkel indicated, however, that he would not leave 
the decision to a meeting of the land chairmen with Moellemann. 
"There is no imperative mandate, but the party leadership 
accepts that -- based on the preparatory talks -- I submit my 
proposal to the party group of the Federal Convention." 
  Kinkel said he would bring up the FDP's wish that the 
protection of minorities should be anchored in the constitution 
as a separate article "in coalition talks," even though the 
CDU/CSU has so far rejected it. In addition, the FDP would 
discuss in coalition talks the "overall context" of dual 
citizenship and a law on the limitation of immigration. 
However, the FDP would not bring in the Bundesrat draft, which 
was rejected last week, as its own motion without the consent of 
its coalition partner, as some presidium members had demanded on 
2 May. "We cannot force anything." Kinkel said: "We will not 
announce anything that cannot be implemented." He said the FDP 
did not make the continuation of the coalition "conditional on 
certain terms and does not build hurdles that may be 
insurmountable." Therefore, the FDP did not insist that its 
demands be accepted in the coalition prior to the Bundestag 
elections. However, the FDP would point out problems in the 
election campaign "whose solution the CDU/CSU has prevented." 
Kinkel said the FDP would fight to resume its goals in the new 
coalition: "we have the right to become a bit more critical, 
without endangering the coalition." The Rostock party congress 
should "not be a party congress of internal security," said 
Kinkel. The FDP did not dodge the issues of internal security. 
"However, I do not like it at all that the impression is being 
created that crime could be combated by laws." According to 
Kinkel, the Federal Government is only responsible for the 
Federal Office of Criminal Investigation and border protection, 
whereas the laender are responsible for combating crime. 
Therefore, one should address minister-presidents like Rudolf 
Scharping and Erwin Teufel and stop the "impudent hide-and-seek 
game" in which the buck is passed to Bonn. 
<H5>  "Decision in the End Stretch" </H5>
  Kinkel said: "I am now increasingly enjoying the combination 
of the offices of foreign minister and party chairman; I am 
looking forward to the election campaign." He said that as a 
long-distance runner, he had learned that "a race is not decided 
in a curve or in the middle of the stretch, but in the end 
stretch." Kinkel claimed that his "stayer qualities and his 
optimism" were apparently successful. 
  At its closed meeting, the FDP Presidium adopted "14 
arguments for a strong FDP" to give the direction for the 
election campaign. The main points are the following: Austerity 
and consolidation course to reduce the state quota to the level 
prior to reunification by the end of this decade; privatization 
and deregulation; more flexible work hours and flexibility in 
connection with company pay settlements and more favorable 
conditions for people setting up new medium-sized businesses. 
There will be no inheritance and property tax increases, as the 
SPD is planning to introduce, nor will there be higher burdens 
for "higher income groups" in the form of a surcharge. The FDP 
seeks to lower all income tax rates and to abolish the trade 
tax. The FDP intends to counteract "slogans demanding special 
surcharges for high income earners." The FDP describes itself 
as the "party of the service sector, property, and technical 
innovation." "We are suffocating from our social system." With 
the introduction of a "citizens money system" 
[Buergergeldsystem], a certain simplification is to be brought 
about.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine by </F>
Einar Koch; place and date not given: "Lafontaine -- Lower Taxes 
for Average Earners"] 
  [Text] [Koch] Solar tax, taxes levied on people without 
children -- everyone in the Social Democratic Party [SPD] wants 
something different. What can we expect from an SPD government? 
  [Lafontaine] Everything is clear for us now: There will be 
no tax increases with the SPD! This has been settled. On the 
contrary: We will lower the tax burden for average earners. 
Solar pfennig or taxes on childless couples -- no such things 
will take place with Rudolf Scharping and me. 
  I am, however, calling upon [Finance Minister] Theo Waigel: 
Stop the Omerta! The Sicilian law of silence must no longer be 
applied to the planned tax increases by the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany. 
  [Koch] What are the coalition's plans on tax increases? 
  [Lafontaine] There is increasing evidence that the Federal 
Government is planning a whole package of tax increases 
following the Bundestag elections. The government coalition has 
prepared specific plans for increasing the value-added tax, 
property tax, and the mineral oil tax. In addition, motorists 
will be burdened with tolls. 
  [Koch] Have you forgotten that the SPD wants to introduce a 
10-percent supplementary charge? 
  [Lafontaine] The Federal Government's 7.5-percent solidarity 
surcharge will also hit small and medium earners. We will 
abolish that immediately. Our supplementary charge will 
completely relieve 80 percent of all taxpayers of this 
solidarity surcharge. This will be a major tax cut for the 
great majority. 
  For the remaining 20 percent -- that is, married couples 
earning gross annual incomes of 120,000 German marks [DM] and 
singles at DM60,000 marks -- we will increase the government's 
7.5-percent surcharge by a mere 2.5 percent. Since the little 
people have been the only ones that have had to pay in the past, 
this will be a justifiable sacrifice for German unity. 
  [Koch] The SPD is losing in opinion polls; is the "comrade 
trend" shaking? 
  [Lafontaine] All polls indicate that the SPD is ahead, and 
the Kohl government does not have a majority.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Jagoda: Rays of Hope Visible in </F>
Western Germany"] 
  [Text] In April, the number of unemployed persons in 
Germany fell by 93,800 to 3.807 million because of seasonal 
trends. Commenting on this in Nuremberg, Bernhard Jagoda, head 
of the Federal Employment Agency, said that the labor markets in 
eastern and western Germany "appear somewhat friendlier than in 
previous months." 
  The effects of the recession are continuing in the old 
laender, but they are weaker than they used to be. "Rays of 
hope are visible," said Jagoda. In western Germany in April, 
there were 2.59 million unemployed, 49,700 less than in March, 
and 393,600 less than in March 1993. 
  In April, some 175,300 job vacancies were reported to labor 
exchanges in western Germany, 2 percent more than in April 1993. 
"Even if the observers only expect the fall in employment to 
cease at the end of the year, we already detect positive signs 
judging from the job vacancies that are being reported," said 
Jagoda. 
  The demand for jobs in the processing industries has 
improved 
in particular. This branch of industry was hit relatively hard 
and early by the recession. In April, 35,400 jobs in this 
industry were reported to labor exchanges, 15 percent more than 
in the previous April. The best prospects are to be seen in the 
electrical, machine construction, and chemical industries. 
  Temporary employment has sunk remarkably quickly in western 
Germany. One-month jobs fell by almost 100,000, and one-year 
jobs by 675,000, reaching 367,800. "Most enterprises have 
reverted to full-time work," Jagoda observed. This confirms the 
forecasts of research institutes, which said at the beginning of 
the year that following an economic improvement, working hours 
would be extended first of all, but manpower levels would only 
be increased after the economic upturn had gathered momentum. 
  In the new laender, the number of unemployed in April fell 
by 
44,100, to reach 1,216,000. The number of temporary employees 
in eastern Germany fell by 10,900, reaching 124,900, half the 
level of April 1993. Particularly noticeable is the fall in 
employment in the construction and machine industries. 
  Concerning the development of the labor market for women, 
Jagoda opposed any discrimination of the feminine sex. Women do 
not have to be considered a general problem of the labor market, 
he said. After all, in the old laender, there is hardly any 
difference between male and female unemployment figures. At the 
end of April, 9.3 percent of women of working age were 
unemployed, and 9.4 percent of men. The labor administration 
says this is because female employment has decreased only 
slightly in recent times, and female unemployment has increased 
at a below-average amount. 
  But Jagoda had "few good things to say" about the female 
labor market in the new laender. There, women continue to be 
more affected by unemployment than men, and constitute almost 
two-thirds of all unemployed people. 
  Altogether, judging from 1994 figures so far, Jagoda expects 
a better future economic development than expected. The labor 
market need not revise its figures, he said. The labor market 
had reckoned previously that the number of unemployed persons 
would increase by between 300,000 and 400,000 during the course 
of the year.

<F P=106> [Martin Halusa report: "Industry Warns Against Euphoria"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Although industrial 
associations expect a 2-percent increase in productivity this 
year, they also warn against undue euphoria. The labor market, 
they say, is a late indicator of economic trends, and provides 
few conclusions about the overall economic situation. The 20 
largest German industrial enterprises will shed a total of 
50,000 jobs in 1994, compared to more than 100,000 jobs shed in 
1993. Most of the jobs will disappear through earlier 
retirement or natural fluctuations. 
  The Automobile Industry Association says: "Regardless of the 
economic recovery, the negative trend is continuing, although a 
slight improvement can be noted." 
  The Association of German Machinery and Equipment Producers 
says: "The situation is still deteriorating. The reduction of 
jobs in some enterprises is greater than the demand for jobs in 
others." 
  The Central Electrical Industry Association says: "The fall 
in employment is gradually slowing down, but a total stop is not 
expected until the middle of the year." The planned reduction 
of jobs in this sector until the end of the year is 10,000. 
  The Metal Industry Employers Association says: "We still 
have a surplus of jobs, but the restructuring is continuing. 
One-third of our firms wants to transfer a part of their 
production to more cost-effective foreign territories." 
  The Chemical Employers Association says: "The personnel 
reduction is continuing, though not as much as in 1993."

<F P=106> [Bernt Conrad commentary: "Hata Wants To Cooperate"] </F>
  [Text] The new Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is 
plagued with bad luck. Hardly had he been appointed Morihoto 
Hosokawa's successor when his grand coalition collapsed, and 
while he toured Europe in an effort to demonstrate his country's 
goodwill, his own justice minister, Shigeto Nagano, disgraced 
him with the most inappropriate comment that Japan never started 
a war against any Asian country in 1937-38. Indignation soared 
in China and South Korea. Hata had to call his unruly colleague 
from Paris and reprimand him, but he made up for this by saying 
that Japan has caused unbearable suffering in its recent history. 
  Germany's friend did not have to expect any trouble in Bonn. 
Naturally, just like Francis Mitterrand in Paris, his German 
interlocutors, Helmut Kohl and Klaus Kinkel, asked him to open 
up Japanese markets wider than before. Hata could not and would 
not contradict their arguments, for it is apparent that the 
sooner Japan facilitates access to its markets, the better will 
German-Japanese trade relations develop. The Japanese guest, 
therefore, promised an improvement. But whether he is able (or 
willing) to coax Japan's stubborn bureaucracy into a more open 
attitude remains doubtful. 
  In any case, during his talks on the Rhine, Hata appeared as 
a pleasant interlocutor who is willing to cooperate 
constructively with the Germans, whom he values so highly, as 
well as with other Europeans and the Americans. He will have a 
practical opportunity to do so at the world economic summit in 
Naples in early July, unless the parliamentary majority at home 
topples him before then.

<F P=106> [Article by Heinz Schmitz: "Only For Cultivating the </F>
Climate"] 
  [Text] The new Japanese prime minister, Tsutomu Hata, 
visited several European capitals last week. According to an 
official statement, he held talks in Bonn "in a friendly 
atmosphere" and discussed with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
relations between the two countries and international affairs. 
As a routine of such talks, the Western side urges better 
access to the Japanese market, and Japan promptly promises to 
make huge efforts to reform the economic structures and open the 
markets. This also happened in Bonn. 
  Under the headline "Preparation of the World Economic 
Summit," which will take place in Naples in July, Kohl urged his 
Japanese visitor to increase support for Russia. While Germany 
has, in the past, borne the main burden, Japan has only shown a 
cold shoulder in this respect. This will hardly change in 
Naples. Nor will the chancellor's wish for increased commitment 
of Japanese companies in eastern Germany be considered as long 
as they cannot expect to get a good return on their investment. 
Both governments see themselves in one boat on their way to a 
permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Even though the 
arguments exchanged are not new, it is sensible for the chiefs 
of governments from friendly nations to meet personally at 
regular intervals. Cultivating the political climate is of 
importance.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian National Alliance leader Gianfranco </F>
Fini by Stefano Caviglia in Rome; date not given: "`That Motion 
Is in Bad Faith'"] 
  [Excerpt] "Great, magnificent work! Send me the document 
in all the languages immediately." Gianfranco Fini is on the 
phone, standing in the middle of his office in Via della Scrofa, 
almost radiant. He has just discovered the mystery behind the 
European Parliament motion. It seems that the motion that won 
majority approval in Strasbourg and which calls on Italy to 
stand by the "fundamental values that informed the foundation of 
the Community after the horrors of fascism and Nazism" was not 
worded quite like that after all. The reference to fascism and 
Nazism is present, in fact, only in the Italian version. "From 
what I have just heard," explains Fini with mounting 
satisfaction, "the speaker of the European Parliament has just 
ordered an inquiry." 
  [Caviglia] So in your view, the motion is little more than a 
gaffe? 
  [Fini] Let us say that someone has obviously been acting in 
bad faith. But even before I knew about this addition, I said 
from the outset that the Strasbourg motion is nothing but a 
left-wing initiative designed to give the Italian "comrades," 
who were so soundly beaten at the election, a last-minute 
helping hand. The only statement made by a government official 
came from the French foreign minister, who has said quite 
clearly that he will judge the Italian government by how it 
behaves and what it does, not by the names of those forming it. 
This does not worry me at all. However, I concur absolutely 
with Scalfaro's reply. 
  [Caviglia] Nevertheless, you have had some problems with the 
foreign press, including papers that are not left-wing. 
  [Fini] A distinction must be drawn here between those that 
are in bad faith and those that are ill-informed. There are 
papers that do not even have a correspondent in Italy and merely 
copy what the Italian dailies write. As soon as the government 
has been finalized, I will ask for a meeting with the foreign 
press, and you will see that everything will go more smoothly 
afterwards. 
  [Caviglia] So Italy runs no risk whatsoever of international 
isolation? 
  [Fini] None at all. The debate has arisen partly with an eye 
to the Italian political battle and partly in view of the 
European elections. There are fears of a heavy defeat for the 
Left in France and Spain. It will all die down once the 
government has taken its first foreign policy measures and 
everyone has realized there is no need to worry. Anyway, all 
they need to do is look at what the four MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] deputies are doing in Strasbourg. The one thing that 
cannot be said is that they have been singing the praises of 
fascism. One is Pino Rauti... 
  [Caviglia] Who, nevertheless, still regards himself as a 
fascist, does he not? 
  [Fini] He is the one to ask about that. 
  [Caviglia] And what about your views on Europe? Is there not 
a risk that they will widen the rift between Italy and 
Strasbourg as well? 
  [Fini] The functioning of the European Union is an extremely 
serious matter. Political unity is practically nonexistent in 
Europe. There is strong financial, but not economic unity. 
Anyway, who is to decide what Europe must be like? The German 
central bank or the national parliaments and the various 
peoples? Italy is paying the price of a European policy without 
originality, which in some cases has even sacrificed our 
national interests. We do not want to withdraw from Europe, but 
Europe as it is emerging is serving the interests of its peoples 
less and less and those of the financial centers more and more. 
  [Caviglia] And what about your relations with the Right in 
the other countries? Which is preferable: Chirac's Right or Le 
Pen's? Kohl or the Republikaner? 
  [Fini] Everyone knows I have no political regard for the 
Republikaner in Germany. As far as France is concerned, in a 
European context I certainly prefer Chirac's Right to that of Le 
Pen. It is more difficult to judge at the national political 
level. [passage omitted]

  [Text] An (as yet) unknown hand has touched up the Italian 
edition of the European Parliament motion, proposed by the 
Socialists, on the next Italian government's "loyalty to the 
values of the European Community." The original text contained 
no reference to fascism and Nazism, whereas this reference is 
clear and explicit in the version drafted in our language. How 
come? It is a mystery. The least one can say is that there is 
something suspicious about it. The document itself, even without 
the most offensive phrase, clearly interferes in the life of a 
sovereign state, and the president of the Republic and the 
speakers of both houses of parliament were therefore right to 
protest strongly. 
  It must also be said that while the resolution voices no 
explicit attack on the National Alliance [AN], we cannot close 
our eyes to the fact that the "warning" is unacceptable in view 
of the fact that neither the AN nor the other members of the 
future government alliance have ever shown hostility to the 
values underlying the European Union. 
  It follows that both this little mystery and the overall 
smoke screen of polemics that is being fanned day after day in 
Europe around events in Italy have but a single source: The 
Left in our country is conspiring with the Left in the whole 
continent to do all it can to demonize a government willed by 
the people (as even [former Prime Minister] Ciriaco De Mita has 
emphasized). 
  However, as Gianfranco Fini has said, the "affair" can only 
die down once the new executive has assumed its full powers and 
can set to work in the country's interests. Leaving aside the 
progressive and pseudocommunist papers and circles of the old 
continent, Europe will then realize that no threats to free 
institutions can come from National Alliance ministers, who will 
not fail to win acclaim for the respect in which they will hold 
the values of democracy, tolerance, peace, and solidarity. 
  So let us note with deep concern that the Left is working at 
all levels not to exert its legitimate, normal opposition, but 
to poison the political and social atmosphere in Italy and 
elsewhere. The outcome of the work of the professional 
intriguers is always unpredictable. We hope that the country 
will boycott them. For the general good.

<F P=106> [Report by Umberto Rosso: "Berlusconi Loses His Cool"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- So what if the European Parliament has 
excommunicated the fascist ministers? "There is no reason to 
assume that the members of that Parliament are enlightened by 
divine grace and can really understand the situation. In fact 
in this instance they have proven the contrary." This was the 
comment from Berlusconi, who defended himself by firing 
point-blank at the European Parliament. And by acting tough 
with reporters. The journalists who gathered outside his house 
yesterday morning to ask whether the European Union's "no" will 
influence his approach, did not receive his usual smile: "How 
can you talk about something that you know nothing about yet? 
You are incapable -- most of you, I mean -- of understanding 
innovation. You think according to the old patterns and cannot 
even see the innovations that are occurring." The antifascist 
"Euromotion" has irritated Berlusconi, who referred to Scalfaro 
("the president responded very well") and who now has to deal 
with an institutional and political storm. 
  All senior officials, including Ciampi, are on the 
president's side. The outgoing prime minister stressed his 
"full support" for Scalfaro's remarks about "Italy's loyalty to 
the values and principles that lie at the root of Europe's 
Constitution." [Chamber of Deputies Speaker] Irene Pivetti -- 
following the example of the Senate speaker's immediate response 
-- wrote a letter expressing her resentment to European 
Parliament Speaker Egon Klepsch, condemning "the substantial 
interference in the delicate constitutional procedures under way 
in our country." And [Senate Speaker] Scognamiglio announced 
that yesterday he also telephoned Klepsch, from whom he learned 
of the latter's "opposition" to the motion approved, which he 
personally did not vote for. 
  The resolution has split the parties in two, perfectly (or 
almost) matching the actual alignments, with the pro-Berlusconi 
front resolutely against and the anti-Berlusconi archipelago in 
favor. So the progressive forces and the PPI [Italian Popular 
Party] and Segni's center are pleased: According to [Democratic 
Party of the Left, PDS Secretary General Achille] Occhetto, the 
motion expresses "a not unfounded and widespread anxiety in 
Europe" and Scalfaro was wrong to consider it "on the one hand 
inevitable and on the other hand undesirable." Forza Italia and 
the National Alliance are furious, with the Northern League 
somewhere in between. This is what Bossi had to say: "Never 
mind Berlusconi and his followers, we have an antifascist past. 
Fascism, as it was conceived, no longer exists, but we must 
remain vigilant." Then there is Maroni, who should be number 
two in the government that will include the ministers that 
Strasbourg considers fascists and who, according to the news 
agencies, changed, within the space of half an hour, from 
complacency to a rejection of the "Euroappeal." His first 
comment, released at midday: "Does it constitute a problem for 
us? No. If anything, it is a problem for Berlusconi. We too 
have been saying these things for some time." Here is his 
second version, timed at 1230: "The motion was inadvisable, and 
constitutes pressure on the government that is about to be 
formed. I have seen the names that are being mentioned for the 
government, and I do not think they include any fascists or 
individuals that pose a threat to democracy." 
  The other prospective deputy prime minister, the MSI's 
[Italian Social Movement] Giuseppe Tatarella, displayed no such 
inconsistencies and said that the resolution is merely 
"obsolete, retroactive, and transcended by the people's vote." 
"Banana republic stuff," was the comment from Mirko Tremaglia, 
the MSI's candidate for the ministry dealing with expatriate 
Italians. What about their secretary, Fini? He does not seem 
very worried: "The issue will die down when the government 
receives parliament's vote of confidence and can work on behalf 
of the country's interests." 
  In any case, the resolution "contains no reference to the 
National Alliance." It is "an attack by all the left-wing 
forces. Europe will acknowledge that a government including 
National Alliance members does not constitute a threat but 
guarantees freedom, democracy, and peace for Europe too." The 
Left challenged the idea that the European Parliament interfered 
in Italy's affairs, albeit with differences of emphasis. Thus 
[PDS number two] D'Alema acknowledged that Scalfaro considered 
it his duty "to protect our country's sovereignty," but added 
that this does not alter the fact that "the anxieties remain." 
Nilde Jotti did not exactly agree, saying that, even if the 
Italian situation may prompt anxiety, "the resolution, which is 
unprecedented, is rather heavy-handed." And the former Chamber 
speaker's criticism of Scalfaro was not for having spoken out 
("I would have done so too"), but for his tone: "A response 
providing guarantees would have been better." There were 
disagreements in the Center too, but these were more to be 
expected. Formigoni, former European deputy for the DC 
[Christian Democratic Party] and now a member of the PPI's 
pro-Berlusconi wing, did not at all appreciate the 
excommunication of fascist ministers: "It must have been one of 
those motions submitted and approved with no debate, under the 
impetus of a tide of propagandist feeling."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on press conference by Jean-Pierre Cot, </F>
leader of the Socialist group in the European Parliament on 5 
May; place not given: "Cot: Fini Must Say He Disowns 
Mussolini"; first two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Strasbourg -- Jean-Pierre Cot has not changed his 
mind, even after the high feeling caused in the Strasbourg 
parliament by the protests from President Scalfaro, Senate 
Speaker Scognamiglio, and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Pivetti 
over the motion urging Italy not to include fascist ministers 
among its representatives. 
  After a very turbulent morning, the chairman of the 
Socialist 
Eurodeputies called a press conference in mid-afternoon to 
reaffirm his position, without yielding an inch. He confirmed, 
first, that it was he personally who initiated the paragraph in 
the resolution voted on by the PSE [European Socialist Party], 
which so offended some people in Italy. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you not think that the initiative 
constitutes interference in Italy's internal affairs? 
  [Cot] No interference. It is a document addressed to the 
Community's heads of state and government. We addressed them to 
emphasize a problem that exists and that is not without 
importance. The possible future presence of Italian fascist 
ministers in the EC Council would be unacceptable to us. We 
could not engage in dialogue with fascist ministers. And if 
there were any fascist members of the European Commission we 
would deny our approval of that Commission. Let us consider 
another country; let us suppose an Italian-type situation were 
to occur in France. Well, I would be very glad if my country 
received from Europe a precise and strong reminder of the 
sacrosanct nature of the principles of antifascism. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But do you not think that it could be 
considered antidemocratic to criticise the Italian electorate's 
free vote? 
  [Cot] The Italians may vote however they want; but they 
cannot demand that we engage in dialogue with fascist ministers. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Have we in some sense reached a new form of 
limited sovereignty? 
  [Cot] No. We are freely joined by an agreement. If someone 
violates the fundamental principles that underlie that 
agreement, then the union is violated. Our Europe was born from 
the defeat of fascism and Nazism. If someone who identifies 
with fascism enters a government, we consider the original 
agreement to have been violated. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But who are the fascists? How are we to 
define a fascist today? In Italy there will be ministers chosen 
by the leaders of the party that won a normal election. Where 
does fascism come into it? In what way have the democratic 
rules been violated? 
  [Cot] Our issue has to do not with legality but with 
legitimization. Hitler too acceded to power legally and was not 
challenged because there were no legal bases for doing so. I 
thought that everyone had learned that lesson. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But Mr. Cot, who is Italy's Hitler? 
  [Cot] I am not saying that there is a Hitler, but am 
pointing 
out that in the coalition that is about to come to government in 
Italy, one of the allies identifies with fascist principles. 
Mr. Fini describes Mussolini as a great statesman, he does not 
disown fascism and its principles. If Fini rejects the 
principles of fascism, if he considers Mussolini an expression 
of antidemocratic principles, let him say so clearly. I will be 
pleased to hear it. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] After the intense reaction in Italy, would 
you submit the same motion again today? 
  [Cot] I know that some people are surprised by the tone of 
that paragraph and by its content. I am surprised by their 
surprise. I have no problem in engaging in dialogue with 
conservatives. But fascists are another matter. A fascist 
minister or a fascist commissioner speaks on my behalf, too; he 
represents me too when he travels around the world, and I really 
cannot accept that. Here we have Le Pen, and there are Italian 
fascist deputies, and we tolerate them. But fascist ministers 
are another matter.

<F P=106> [Report by Stefano Marroni: "Armed Truce Within PDS"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- It was a heavy blow that was delivered, and 
the reaction -- probably -- was the expected one. And so, on 
the day of the interview by means of which [Democratic Party of 
the Left, PDS, Secretary] Achille Occhetto suddenly jumped into 
the race to the PDS secretariat, it was above all the majority 
of the leadership's silence which betrayed the sort of 
impression produced at the Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters] by 
the secretary's move, by the peremptory way in which the man who 
ferried the party [from communism to social democratic values] 
staked out the field for a confrontation which is bound to flare 
up again after the European elections. However, the silence 
hardly concealed the concern felt at the tense atmosphere within 
the PDS -- an armed truce inviting many to postpone any further 
comment, thus adopting, basically, an attitude which [PDS 
official] Gavino Angius summarized on everyone's behalf in the 
following terms: "I would rather not say anything for the 
moment." 
  [L'UNITA editor] Walter Veltroni kept rigorously silent, 
taking up the position of a spectator, and so did [PDS Deputy 
Leader] Massimo D'Alema, the main addressee -- according to the 
unanimous interpretation at Montecitorio [Parliament] -- of the 
messages from a secretary who flatly rejected the idea of 
"transition" being round the corner, and who was prepared to 
throw down the gauntlet of a congress with opposing motions, in 
the event that the request for a change of the guard at the 
Botteghe Oscure were motivated by policy considerations. 
  Inevitably, within the next few days problems will arise in 
connection with the debate on the reshuffle of the secretariat, 
as already apparent from a number of venomous remarks, bordering 
on bad taste, which were leaked here and there. However, 
nothing was known -- everybody agreed -- about the role that 
Occhetto intended to assign to the "member for Gallipoli 
[D'Alema]," although the latter's return to the party leadership 
was a foregone conclusion. For his part, D'Alema was watching 
developments like a bystander, saying only that he had started 
working on an article for L'UNITA, in which he will summarize 
his political platform "in a more structured way," and without 
attempting to cash in on the success of an operation which bears 
his distinctive signature (on the same day that Occhetto 
welcomed the entire Socialist contingent into the progressive 
group in the Chamber of Deputies, and Francesco De Martino was 
elected as the progressive senators' "guarantor" in the upper 
house). 
  It was [PDS official] Fabio Mussi who stressed that "what 
should have been done immediately is now being done belatedly," 
explaining that unity was the prerequisite for the progressives 
"to be able to carry some weight in this period, which is still 
transitional in nature, and in which the Right's victory has not 
closed the game." 
  However, the progressive deputy floor leader did not refrain 
from commenting on Occhetto's interview: "As regards the 
method," he said, "Occhetto, quite rightly, is not ruling out 
any solutions. As regards the substance, clearly we find what 
may be called a strong vindication of his own merits. In short, 
the pot is boiling, albeit still slowly, and we will have to 
wait and see what comes out of it. The main point is that the 
leadership issue has finally been raised, which is as things 
should be -- provided that this does not interfere with the need 
to resume the debate on political issues, to replenish our fuel 
tanks: Otherwise we will end up with a referendum, and we run 
the risk of a debacle. Instead, we must go back to the climate 
of the transition, when political choices and men were closely 
linked." 
  Mussi's concerns are shared by the party's most significant 
local leaders, regardless of their position in relation to the 
fixed stars in the Botteghe Oschure's firmament. However, from 
Sergio Sabattini's words, Occhetto obtained confirmation that 
the Emilia PDS's "armored tanks" were siding with him: "I 
believe the interview in L'UNITA signals a turn for the better," 
said the secretary from Bologna. "Honestly speaking, this year I 
did not see any disagreements emerge within the majority that 
led the party. Am I wrong? Are there any? If there are, it 
will be a good thing if they are expressed, if majorities and 
minorities are formed at the congress, and if a leadership is 
defined on this basis. Otherwise it makes no sense to speak of 
renewal: Occhetto may not be a secretary for life, but the task 
of guiding the completion of the PDS's formation, and of opening 
up a stage of broader alliance, falls to him." Sabattini, one 
of the staunchest advocates of a "federal party," had a further 
message for the Botteghe Oscure: "They must realize in Rome," 
he stressed, "that organizations with a strong membership and 
strong support from the voters, such as the Emilia PDS, are no 
longer prepared to passively accept choices that do not involve 
the real party. Occhetto is accused of being a centralist? All 
right then, the answer to that, if we want to prepare for the 
congress, is for at least three regional secretaries to join the 
new Secretariat, and of course I have in mind those from Emilia, 
Tuscany, and one of the southern regions in which we won. If we 
carry on along the old path, I believe a very firm reaction can 
be expected from the stronger organizations."

    [Editorial Report] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva's activities 
and policies have been the subject of commentaries in the 
Portuguese press. 
<H5>  Visit to China, Repercussions for East Timor </H5>
  Writing in the 18 April Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, 
political analyst Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa characterizes Cavaco 
Silva's recent visit to China as his "return to `realpolitik.'" 
Cavaco Silva went farther than other European leaders in 
deemphasizing the issue of human rights, saying that on this 
issue there is only a "difference in emphasis" between China and 
Portugal. Rebelo de Sousa notes that in a recent speech, 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Durao Barroso defined national 
interest as the main criterion for Portuguese foreign policy. 
The prime minister's statements during his China visit suggest 
that the government has already chosen its policy on East Timor, 
Rebelo de Sousa writes. If "realpolitik" is considered more 
important than human rights in China, the same ought to apply to 
Indonesia. The problem of East Timor is thus reduced to 
realpolitik that takes into account Indonesia's importance, the 
international context, and Portugal's real influence in the 
area. This might lead the Indonesian Government to accept 
regional autonomy for East Timor and the Portuguese Government 
to agree to it as a basis for discussion "without losing face in 
the long term." If this is in fact Portuguese policy, the 
government should make it clear so that no illusions are 
cherished about Portugal's role in the East Timor issue, Rebelo 
de Sousa concludes. 
<H5>  "Cavacoism" Criticized </H5>
  In an article in the 14 April Lisbon weekly VISAO, former 
Social Democratic Party (PSD) deputy and now PSD critic Helena 
Roseta accuses Cavaco Silva of arrogance and secrecy in 
government decisions. In presuming he is "infallible," the prime 
minister "disdainfully ignores the vertiginous changes taking 
place in the world" and expects from the people "obedience, 
discipline, faith, and gratitude." "Cavacoism" persists in a 
"simplistic" and "authoritarian" approach to an increasingly 
complex and uncertain world. The role of "national savior" that 
Cavaco Silva has arrogated to himself is incompatible with a 
modern vision of society, Roseta notes. His "patriotic and 
moralistic fundamentalism" is a genuine "disease of power," a 
virus that the country should urgently shake off, she concludes. 
<H5>  No Cavaco Silva Presidency Seen </H5>
  According to Jose Antonio Saraiva's "Politics 
Portuguese-Style" column in the 9 April Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, 
Cavaco Silva will not be a presidential candidate at the end of 
President Mario Soares's current term. Cavaco Silva would like 
to be seen in history as the prime minister who ensured 
political stability, economic recovery, and Portugal's 
integration into Europe, Saraiva writes. He would thus be 
reluctant to give up leadership of the government at a time of 
crisis, when the European Union is undergoing what is perhaps 
its "most turbulent" phase. Having excluded himself from the 
race, Cavaco Silva would like to support the candidacy of 
Socialist Party luminary and Lisbon Mayor Jorge Sampaio, Saraiva 
contends. This would allow him to maintain "a certain tension" 
in the relations between the prime ministership and the 
presidency, a prospect that is not "displeasing" to him, as a 
"subservient" PSD president would not be in his interest. 
According to Saraiva, however, Sampaio could not attract the 
support of the PSD, a party already divided by the opposition of 
some members who reject any departure from social democratic 
ideals. The same problem would apply to another candidate, 
former President Ramalho Eanes, Saraiva contends. Other 
potential candidates mentioned by Saraiva are Minister of 
Defense Fernando Nogueira, a "logical choice for the Cavacoist 
apparatus," Francisco Pinto Balsemao, a PSD party founder, Joao 
de Deus Pinheiro, a former minister, and General Vasco Rocha 
Vieira, who is now governor of Macao.

    [Editorial Report] The results of a number of polls have 
recently appeared in the Portuguese press. 
<H5>  Leaders' Popularity Surveyed </H5>
  The results of a poll conducted jointly by the Lisbon weekly 
O INDEPENDENTE and the Lisbon Catholic University among 1,066 
individuals (no further details provided) were published in the 
22 April edition of O INDEPENDENTE. Respondents were asked to 
rate political leaders on a scale of 1 (worst possible rating) 
to 10 (best). Prime Minister Cavaco Silva led the list with 8.2 
points, followed by Socialist Party (PS) leader Antonio Guterres 
with 7.6, Center Social Democratic Party (CDS) leader Manuel 
Monteiro, and Communist Party (PCP) leader Carlos Carvalhas with 
5.5. Respondents were also asked to evaluate the government's 
actions. Some 7.8 percent thought these were "good," 51.8 
percent thought they were "reasonably good," and 37.9 percent 
said they were "bad." When rating Cavaco Silva's qualities as 
compared with Guterres's, 36.4 percent of the respondents said 
the prime minister is "competent," compared with 24.6 percent 
who thought so for Guterres. Some 49.4 percent thought Cavaco 
Silva is "intelligent," compared with 34.3 percent for Guterres. 
The prime minister was also thought more "honest," more 
"sincere," more "efficient," and more "cultured" than Guterres, 
losing to the PS leader in "tolerance" and "humanism." The prime 
minister's popularity, however, has apparently not transferred 
to his party, for the poll indicated that if legislative 
elections were held at this time, the PS would win with 36.6 
percent of the vote, followed by the PSD with 25.8 percent, the 
PCP with 6.3 percent, the CDS with 5.6 percent, other parties 
with 1 percent, and 24.7 percent undecided. When respondents 
were asked their preference for president, former President 
Ramalho Eanes and Cavaco Silva were both chosen by 15.9 percent, 
followed by Lisbon Mayor Jorge Sampaio with 14.3 percent, Porto 
Mayor Fernando Gomes with 10.5 percent, Eurodeputy Lucas Pires 
with 6.5 percent, CDS luminary Adriano Moreira with 3.2 percent, 
and former PSD Minister Eurico de Melo with 2.8 percent. Some 
18.8 percent chose none of them, and 13 percent did not know or 
did not answer. The government's actions on the economy were 
rated "very bad" and "bad" by 59.1 percent of the respondents, 
compared with 3.4 percent who termed them "good" or "very good," 
and 36.4 percent who considered them "reasonably good." 
<H5>  Poll on European Parliament Elections </H5>
  The 14 April Lisbon weekly VISAO published the results of a 
Marktest/VISAO poll conducted between 12 and 30 March in the 
Greater Lisbon and Greater Porto areas among 812 individuals, 
with a 4.6 percent margin of error. Respondents were asked their 
party preference for the 12 June European Parliament elections. 
Of the 455 respondents who said they would vote, 47.9 percent 
would cast their ballot for the PS, while 28.1 percent would 
vote for the PSD. The CDS (11 percent) and the PCP (4.8 percent) 
followed. Some 27.3 percent of the respondents did not know if 
they would vote. 
<H5>  Public Opinion of 25 April Revolution Surveyed </H5>
  In view of the forthcoming celebration of the 25 April 
revolution that in 1974 freed Portugal from its period of 
dictatorship, the 20 April Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS 
published the results of a poll (no details provided) in which 
respondents were asked to rate political leaders who most 
contributed to the democratization and development of Portugal. 
Some 33.8 percent chose President Mario Soares. He was followed 
by the late Prime Minister Sa Carneiro (15.8 percent), Prime 
Minister Cavaco Silva (10.9 percent), former President Ramalho 
Eanes (7.6 percent), and former PCP leader Alvaro Cunhal (7.4 
percent). Another question focused on whether the goals of 
democratization and development of the 25 April revolution have 
been achieved. Some 24.4 percent said democratization has been 
achieved fully, 46 percent thought it was achieved partially, 
9.5 percent said it was not achieved at all, and 20.1 percent 
did not know or did not answer. Only 11.4 percent said the 
development goal has been achieved, 48.6 percent that it was 
partially achieved, 19.2 percent thought it was not achieved, 
and 20.9 percent did not know or did not answer.

    [Editorial Report] The appointment of General Gabriel 
Espirito Santo as Army quartermaster general and the Lajes base 
agreement were subjects of discussion in the Portuguese press. 
<H5>  Quartermaster General </H5>
  According to "I.G.T." writing in the 15 April Lisbon weekly 
O 
INDEPENDENTE, General Espirito Santo, presently chief of the 
Portuguese mission to NATO, will be the next Army quartermaster 
general. His appointment, which will become effective at the 
beginning of May, caused surprise in Army ranks, since it was 
expected that he would be nominated to head the Institute for 
Higher Military Studies or the Army's operational command. 
"I.G.T." noted that the quartermaster general post is considered 
a stepping stone to the position of chief of the Armed Forces 
general staff. This expectation will probably apply to Gen. 
Espirito Santos as well, "I.G.T." writes, as he enjoys "great 
prestige and the sympathies of the political powers that be." 
<H5>  Lajes Agreement Update </H5>
  The resolution of possible labor conflicts is the last 
hurdle 
before signing a Lajes base agreement between the United States 
and Portugal, writes Jose Vegar in the 23 April Lisbon weekly 
SEMANARIO. A meeting of the two sides at the end of April in 
Washington will attempt to reach a consensus on a labor 
agreement for the Lajes base, including eventual indemnification 
to dismissed workers, a burden Washington does not want to 
assume alone. "Strangely," according to Jose Vegar, no date has 
been scheduled yet for the signing of the agreement, with both 
sides awaiting a "propitious date."

  [Excerpt] Baltasar Garzon has resigned. The secretary of 
state for the National Plan Against Drugs says that his decision 
is irrevocable. It is not yet known whether he will resign from 
his seat as a deputy in Congress. Garzon ran as an independent, 
as number two on the Spanish Socialist Workers Party list for 
Madrid in the last electons. 
  There have been rumors about Garzon's resignation ever since 
the prime minister announced yesterday that the Ministries of 
the Interior and Justice will be combined. In fact, Garzon was 
number two in the Interior Ministry. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gonzalez's Government Crumbling: </F>
Tide of Corruption Brings Down Agriculture Minister"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Felipe Gonzalez will try today to curb the 
disintegration of the government over the corruption cases by 
means of a reshuffle involving two ministries (interior and 
agriculture) and the acceptance of Carlos Solchaga's resignation 
as parliamentary spokesman. Gonzalez intends to show in this 
way that "we will go all the way, no matter who falls" and to 
close the political crisis opened by the Roldan and Rubio cases. 
These decisions satisfy the demands of Jordi Pujol who, after 
rejecting another coalition offer Monday [2 May], warned 
Gonzalez yesterday that an early election would be inevitable 
unless he acts quickly. 
  Two resignations in five days. First it was Antoni Asuncion, 
Saturday, over the Roldan case. Then came Vicente Albero 
yesterday, over tax irregularities and connections with the 
office of Manuel de la Concha, the same one used by Mariano 
Rubio. The announcement of Albero's resignation fell like a 
thunderbolt yesterday in the midst of the political storm that 
has been rocking the country for several weeks, though Felipe 
Gonzalez will try today to take the opportunity to begin a 
"recovery." 
  Since the escape last Friday of Luis Roldan, former director 
general of the Civil Guard, Felipe Gonzalez has been immersed in 
the most serious political crisis since he became prime minister 
in 1983 -- a crisis that, rather than abating, has grown in 
intensity in the past few days. Nevertheless, despite the 
disintegration of the government caused by the corruption cases, 
Gonzalez intends to close the crisis today by appointing 
replacements for both ministers and by announcing his acceptance 
of Carlos Solchaga's resignation as parliamentary spokesman over 
his political responsibility in the Rubio case. 
  Agriculture Minister Vicente Albero yesterday announced his 
resignation over "fiscal negligence" with regard to the correct 
procedure for treasury bonds found in Manuel de la Concha's 
office. As he explained at a news conference, in 1983 he sold 
his shares in Marie Claire (textiles), payment for part of which 
he received in the form of mortgage bonds that he deposited with 
De la Concha, as a stock exchange trustee, and that he did not 
declare. Worried that this might affect the government's image, 
Albero said: "I am one of the people who have sacrificed their 
professional lives to devote themselves to politics, and this 
has entailed economic sacrifices for me and my family, but now, 
more than ever, openness is demanded on the part of 
politicians," Cristina de la Hoz reports. 
  This resignation has forced Felipe Gonzalez to carry out a 
more extensive reshuffle that he initially envisaged. After 
receiving Albero in his office yesterday morning, the prime 
minister informed his majesty the king of the changes he will 
make, which he will explain to the media today. 
  Government sources indicated yesterday that Interior 
Minister 
Antonio Asuncion, who resigned Saturday over his "negligence" in 
Roldan's custody, may be replaced by another minister (Juan 
Manuel Eguiagaray or Juan Alberto Belloch) or by someone else 
from outside the government, which would enable Gonzalez to 
reduce the number of changes to two. 
  Although Eguiagaray's move would interrupt the work that he 
has begun at the Industry Ministry, which is crucial to economic 
activity, and although he is not liked by the PNV [Basque 
Nationalist Party], despite his Basque origins, he is the 
favorite candidate of the State Security Forces on account of 
his past connections with the antiterrorist struggle. 
Furthermore, he enjoys good relations not only with Gonzalez 
but also with Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra and is a member 
of the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] Executive 
Committee. 
  According to government sources, one of the new interior 
minister's essential tasks will be "to reorganize" the Interior 
Ministry following the scandals over the award of contracts and 
the use of reserved funds, and at the same time to ensure the 
continuation of the antiterrorist struggle. 
  At the same time, Carlos Solchaga's resignation as 
parliamentary spokesman will oblige Gonzalez to provide other 
replacements. Sources within the Socialist Group indicate former 
Minister Joaquin Almunia as the most likely replacement for 
Solchaga, though this would force Gonzalez to seek a replacement 
for him in the PSOE Executive Committee, in which he occupies 
the post of research and planning secretary. According to 
Socialist sources, Gonzalez will have to seek a "renewal 
heavyweight" to fill the post. 
  In the midst of this crisis, the president of the Catalonian 
Generalidad and Gonzalez's chief partner, Felipe Gonzalez [as 
published; actually Jordi Pujol], warned him yesterday that 
unless he acted quickly and vigorously, an early election would 
be inevitable. However, sources within the CiU [Convergence and 
Union] leadership indicated that Pujol does not want this to 
happen, and that he also rejects a PSOE-CiU coalition government. 
  The CiU leader reaffirmed this rejection Monday at his 
meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra, who conveyed to 
him another offer from Gonzalez to this effect. However, 
Pujol's rejection of such an agreement remains so strong that, 
according to Socialist sources, he hardly allowed Serra even to 
finish suggesting the possibility to him before resolutely 
rejecting the idea that Gonzalez submit himself to a confidence 
motion, since it would force him to be formally associated with 
the prime minister, though he demands that the latter remain in 
his post. 
  The main political trump card that Felipe Gonzalez has to 
play at present is the obvious fact that none of the parties -- 
from CiU through the People's Party -- wants an early election 
now, though this trump card could eventually turn against him.

  [Text] Conditions in the military area of Alakurtti in 
Russia are as Russia has stated, according to a delegation of 
observers that has returned from there. The first Finnish 
military delegation returned this afternoon from the observation 
trip, which is part of the CSCE agreement. Finland has 
previously made a few smaller assessment visits to individual 
units in the areas near Finland. Our correspondent Ritva Saila 
met the delegation when it returned. 
  [Begin Saila recording] The equipment in the 
Kantalahti-Alakurtti area is of such a caliber that Finland 
could be quickly cut in two in case of a crisis. It has been 
said that the bridges and dams on the Kemijoki river could be 
destroyed in a moment. Near the area of Salla, only a few dozen 
kilometers from the border, there has for years been a motorized 
infantry division of 6,000-7,000 men. However, in the last few 
years equipment in that area has increased. According to 
international information, a couple of helicopter regiments have 
been moved there from Central Europe, mainly Germany. It is said 
that they have 200 helicopters, including the fastest helicopter 
gunships in the world, the Mi-24. 
  The Finnish military delegation that returned today from the 
Kantalahti-Alakurtti area and its leader, Colonel Tauno Ylanne 
from the headquarters of the northern defense area, are not 
prepared to confirm this Western information. 
  [Ylanne] It is likely that this information is untrue 
because, according to our observations -- or should I say we did 
not observe this, but we only checked the information that the 
Russians have given in the CSCE process -- we compared that 
information. Quite simply I could say that in my view the main 
thing is that we did not observe such -- in the area where we 
moved -- such military activity that would somehow be contrary 
to the CSCE agreement, different from what the Russians have 
announced. 
  [Saila] Col. Ylanne stressed that the equipment in Alakurtti 
corresponds to the information given by Russia. 
  [Ylanne] According to our observations, what they have 
announced is more or less true. 
  [Saila] Are they defense or attack weapons? 
  [Ylanne] They are military weapons, and of course you can 
use 
them for both purposes. 
  [Saila] Could you in some way consider these as a threat to 
Finnish security? 
  [Ylanne] No. In my view the arms as such cannot be viewed as 
a threat to Finnish security, especially as we have such 
friendly relations at the moment. 
  [Saila] It has been said that more troops are going to be 
moved to that area; is that true? 
  [Ylanne] Well, the aim of our trip was not to find out about 
that, but our aim was to observe military activities there at 
the moment and during the time we were there. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Arto Astikainen: "Even the Taloustutkimus Poll </F>
Found Record Support for SDP"] 
  [Text] Taloustutkimus Oy in its latest poll found that 
support for the Social Democratic Party (SDP) is in the record 
range, nearly 34 percent. A few weeks ago, Taloustutkimus saw 
the SDP rise already beginning to culminate and turn downward. 
Now the situation has returned to the earlier trend. 
  Support figures for the SDP as measured by both leading 
polling organizations, Finnish Gallup Oy and Taloustutkimus Oy, 
are quite similar. 
  The Finnish Gallup poll for March showed the SDP at 34.1 
percent, and the poll conducted by Taloustutkimus in the 
March-April time frame was 33.6 percent. The margin of error in 
the results is around 2 points upward or downward, meaning that 
in practice the organizations' figures are the same. 
  The most recent Taloustutkimus poll was based on interviews 
conducted from 11 March through 17 April. The were some 1,800 
voters interviewed. This poll was commissioned by the national 
daily SUOMENMAA. 
  Support for the Center Party in the poll remained around the 
same figures as previous months. It is now 18.3 percent. The 
Conservative Party may have even dropped a little since early 
March; its support was calculated at 17.5 percent. Accordingly, 
the Center Party in this poll went ahead of the Conservatives. 
  There were no great gyrations in support for any party. 
Taloustutkimus shows the problem-ridden Rural Party at 1.5 
percent. 
  Taloustutkimus also asked whether Esko Aho's government 
should now resign. Of the 500 respondents, 37 percent answered 
"yes." In January the "yes" replies amounted to 43 percent. In 
practice there may have been little change, since the margin of 
error with this small a sampling is around 4 percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Increasingly More Want To Go Along </F>
With the EU"] 
  [Text] Almost half, specifically 47 percent, of Finns are 
in favor of joining the EU (European Union). The Finnish 
Broadcasting Company's Finnish-language television news program 
on Friday [22 April] announced results of the most recent 
opinion poll on the issue. Of those queried, 31 percent oppose 
joining and 21 percent have not yet made up their minds. The 
margin of error in the poll is approximately 3 percent. 
  The differences are not great, compared with the 
corresponding poll taken a month ago. The EU supporters have now 
increased by 2 percentage points, and opponents by four points. 
  The group of those unsure whether they are for or against 
has 
clearly gotten smaller. This is above all interpreted as 
resulting from the way the poll was conducted. Questions in the 
second poll were asked through personal interviews, and not by 
telephone [as was the earlier one]. 
  The poll was conducted by Taloustutkimus. A total of 921 
Finnish voters were interviewed in their homes in early April. 
Among other questions presented them was: "Should Finland join 
the EU in accordance with the results achieved in the accession 
talks?" In addition, the interview subject was invited to 
explain his stand. Most replied that Finland cannot afford to 
stay outside, that the country would otherwise simply not be 
able to manage. 
  It is also assumed that EU membership will improve exports 
and reduce prices. 
  Opponents to the EU based their arguments on the belief that 
Finland would lose its independence and its right to decide its 
own interests if the country joined the EU. In addition, many 
are afraid Finland will be forced to pay large sums. General 
uncertainty was also mentioned as a reason.

  [Text] Rear Admiral Sakari Visa, the commander of the Navy, 
thinks that expanding Finland's territorial waters may cause 
problems in safeguarding sufficient supervision of those waters. 
In an interview for the daily TURUN SANOMAT, Visa says that the 
Navy would first need a new patrol squadron of four to five 
vessels as well as fixed supervisory equipment so that the 
supervision of an expanded sea area could be managed properly. 
  Before the end of this month, the government intends to 
submit to the Eduskunta a proposal to move the territorial 
waters limit. The move would multiply Finland's territorial 
water area but the Navy has not been promised any additional 
equipment or staff. Visa would also like Finland to have its 
own submarines. He notes that a squadron of submarines for 
Finland would crucially facilitate supervision and would raise 
the threshold of frontier violations. According to Visa, 
nevertheless the submarines are not the top priority on the 
Navy's list of purchases.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis expressed the 
conviction that the UN secretary general's report to the 
Security Council on the talks on the confidence-building 
measures will record the events as they are and call a spade a 
spade. The president made this statement this evening at the 
presidential palace before his departure for South Africa to 
attend the inauguration of Nelson Mandela, the first 
democratically elected president and the first multiracial 
government of that country. Correspondent Dhimitrios Andreou 
has the following report. 
  [Begin recording] [Andreou] President Kliridhis described 
the elections in South Africa and the abolition of racial 
discrimination as a historic event. We should all, he stressed, 
honor Nelson Mandela for his struggles. President Kliridhis 
however, will go to South Africa.... 
  [Kliridhis] I will also go for another reason, because in 
this country there is a large Cypriot immigrant community and of 
course a Greek immigrant community. In the last two days I am 
there, I will be with the immigrants because they have asked for 
it, they have prepared an agenda.... 
  [Andreou] President Kliridhis was asked about the Cyprus 
issue, what he expects from the secretary general and his report 
to the Security Council, the alternative ways that the Security 
Council should adopt in order to promote a solution of the 
Cyprus issue. Every time a phase concludes, irrespective of its 
result, and before the secretary general submits his report to 
the Security Council, the Americans and British mobilize to 
alter the contents of this report. What information do you have 
regarding the current period and how is the government reacting? 
  [Kliridhis] The information we have is that Robert Lamb, the 
U.S. Government's coordinator on the Cyprus issue, will meet Mr. 
Ulucevic [Turkish state minister on Cyprus] in Vienna. The 
third country reportedly involved is not London but Vienna. We 
have information that Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary 
general's representative, will also be there. Supposedly, the 
reason for their trip, is to convince Mr. Ulucevic to convince 
[Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas to accept the document 
that has been submitted. The evaluations I hear from various 
sides are that there are no possibilities for a change in the 
Turkish position. My estimate is that it is a waste of time, 
but since Mr. Lamb thinks there are still possibilities, perhaps 
it would be a mistake for this meeting not to take place. What 
the Cyprus Government insists on, and which appears to be 
accepted, is that without any delay, the UN secretary general's 
report should be submitted right after 15 May, and that this 
report should call a spade a spade. I believe that there is 
another aspect which is gaining substantial ground, and this is 
Europe's understanding that the Turkish side does not have 
goodwill to promote a solution to the Cyprus issue, either on 
the substance or the confidence-building measures, and that 
Denktas' basic aim is to gain time in hopes that he will achieve 
recognition of the Turkish Cypriot pseudostate. I also want to 
stress that those who promote the position that the 
confidence-building measures should be abandoned and that we 
should return to the substance of the Cyprus issue are helping 
the Turkish side. The correct position is that there can be 
progress neither on the substance nor on the confidence-building 
measures. Progress can only be achieved when the Security 
Council does what it said in its resolutions, that is, study and 
suggest alternative ways for implementation of the resolutions.

  [Text] The Greek Cypriot side is expecting the UN 
Secretary General's report to record the facts objectively and 
as they stand and to put the blame where it belongs--that is, 
entirely on the Turkish side. This was said by Government 
spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis during his speech at the special 
district congress of the DISI [Democratic Rally] Youth 
Organization [NEDISI] in Larnaca. 
  Mr. Kasoulidhis added that the Greek Cypriot side has 
accepted the contents of the suggestion in the 21 March UN 
document on the condition that it also be accepted by the other 
side. He also said that our side could also make many demands 
for improvements to its own benefit, but it has not done so in 
order to facilitate reaching an agreement. Mr. Kasoulidhis 
continued: This acceptance has brought us to the end of the 
road and constitutes our maximum as far as constructive 
intentions and noble gestures. The spokesman added: As 
President Glavkos Kliridhis has also stressed clearly, our 
position is crystal clear: We will accept neither a new 
document nor changes in the current one. Mr. Kasoulidhis 
accused the Turkish side of lacking the political will to accept 
not only the confidence-building measures but also a Cyprus 
solution. 
  A message of greetings from the Greek New Democracy party 
chairman was read and North Epirotes [Greeks from southern 
Albania] also addressed the NEDISI congress, which was devoted 
to the enslaved homelands of Hellenism.

  [Text] The Palestinians have asked to be trained in Cyprus 
and then join the police force of the new Palestinian state that 
will cover the Gaza Strip following the signing of the 
Israeli-Palestinian agreement. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organization has asked the Republic 
of Cyprus officially, through diplomatic channels, whether it is 
possible for the Police Academy to train 500 Palestinian 
citizens every year as police constables or officers. 
  According to our information, the Ministry of Justice and 
Public Order is considering the issue but has not given any 
answer. The Palestinian State will cover in full the cost for 
the training and maintenance of the Palestinian cadets at the 
Police Academy. 
  The PLO has also submitted a similar request for the 
training 
of policemen to Greece, where there is also a school for police 
inspectors. 
  The request by foreigners to attend the Cyprus Police 
Academy 
proves that the level of the academy's three-year educational 
and professional training is very high and recognized 
internationally.

  [Text] A House of Representatives multi-party delegation 
under House President Alexis Galanos will go to Israel this 
evening for a three-day official visit. Speaking at Larnaca 
Airport before the delegation's departure, Galanos said the 
visit is of great importance for strengthening relations between 
Cyprus and Israel. The efforts under way for peace in the Middle 
East, he added, and the latest agreement signed between Israel 
and the Palestinians, open great possibilities for Cyprus as 
well, to promote a solution to its problem.

  [Text] Following the meeting between Greek Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias and his Albanian counterpart Alfred 
Serreqi in Zurich last Tuesday [3 May], the Albanian side 
continues to maintain a hard and often provocative stance. At 
the same time, it says it is ready and willing to normalize 
bilateral relations. 
  The official Albanian Foreign Ministry statement issued 
after 
Serreqi's return from Zurich maintains the entire offensive 
stance toward Athens with detailed reportage on the issues that 
the Albanian side raised with Papoulias. 
  Albanian President Sali Berisha, in an interview yesterday 
evening, blamed the Greek Government for the bloody incident at 
Episkopi, and again unsuccessfully attempted to internationalize 
the issue by claiming that Greece has territorial designs 
against Albania! 
  The Greek Government, which continues to maintain a soft 
tone, was forced yesterday through a government spokesman to 
reject many points in the Albanian statement, which elevated 
reference to issues by the Albanian side to the level of a 
"discussion" between the two foreign ministers. 
  Thus, the government spokesman denied that there was a 
discussion on the issue of Tsamidhes, which the Albanian side 
had indeed mentioned. The spokesman also said that the Greek 
Government cannot address Tirana's demand to suspend the 
operations of radio stations in Corfou and Konitsa, which 
address the Greek minority in Albania. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said: "The 
government has its policy. Greek society has its views, which 
are free, as long as they respect the Constitution and the laws 
of the state, and the Albanian side should become familiar with 
the regulations of a democratic and constitutionally based 
state...." 
  However, the intentional inaccuracies of the official 
Albanian statement on the Papoulias-Serreqi meeting clearly 
prove that Tirana does not plan at the moment, perhaps even for 
domestic reasons, to proceed quickly with the normalization of 
Greek-Albanian relations. In the same statement, Tirana insists 
that "the hold put on implementing the decision to reduce the 
Greek Embassy's staff does not mean that the decision will not 
be implemented...." and again mentions "a logical time frame" 
for reduction of the personnel. 
  According to the same post-dated statement on the meeting 
between the two ministers, the Albanian Government also orally 
rejects the Greek initiative and plan for recognition of 
Albanian seasonal workers in Greece. In its statement, the 
Albanian side notes that the "draft agreement does not solve the 
issue of legalizing the current economic migration of Albanians 
to Greece." 
  In the same statement, Tirana also raises the issue of the 
"border status," claiming that the two ministers also discussed 
the issue of "the presence of proto-Albanians (Arvanites)"!!! in 
Greece. In a television interview on Antenna Television 
yesterday, Albanian President Berisha appeared equally 
provocative. 
  On the one hand, Berisha says he is optimistic about the 
bilateral problems which he hopes will be solved, but on the 
other hand he directly accuses Greece of having "territorial 
designs against Albania." 
  Berisha said: "In order to convince not only me but also the 
international community that the Greeks do not have territorial 
designs, I want them to sign the Florence Protocol... As long 
as they do not sign the Protocol and say that in their strategy 
they include the so-called North Epirus, Albania will have no 
relations with Greece and Cyprus. No country would believe that 
they have a friendly policy and do not have designs in Albania 
with such a policy..." 
  Berisha again directly blames the Greek Government for the 
incident in Episkopi, and by invoking the UN Charter (!!) he 
charges that "any country that allows its territory to be used 
by commandos or terrorist groups is accountable...."

  [Text] Replying to new remarks by Albanian President Sali 
Berisha, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today asked 
for respect for international law regulations regarding the 
Greek minority's human rights in Albania. 
  In an interview, Berisha again attacked our country and 
called on it to choose between the European or Byzantine trend 
which, he said, prevails in our country. 
  Venizelos said that the European trend primarily means 
respect for the principles of a state of justice, respect for 
human rights and of course respect for the rights of the Greek 
minority in Albania. Beyond that, said Venizelos, I do not 
think that many strongly worded statements help to cultivate 
good relations between the two countries. The good relations, 
he continued, definitely depend on respect for the rules I 
mentioned above.

  [Text] Albania is being called upon to prove that it 
respects the principles of international law regarding 
minorities, stressed the government spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos today. Commenting on remarks by Albanian President 
Sali Berisha, according to which the Greek minority in Albania 
enjoys better conditions than other minorities in the Balkans, 
the government spokesman noted that Albania's constitutional 
status is vague, particularly on issues of education and 
religious rights for minorities. Declarations are not enough, 
Venizelos stressed, and continued: There is a need for the 
appropriate legislative, administrative and police practices, 
and the latest arrests of Greek-Albanians do not offer 
guarantees. The spokesman added that during the meeting in 
Zurich between Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and his 
Albanian counterpart Alfred Serreqi, the Greek foreign minister 
raised the issue of respect for human rights and within this 
framework, he mentioned the continued detention of the Albanian 
Socialist Party leader Fatos Nano. 
  Venizelos expressed the hope that New Democracy Chairman 
Miltiadhis Evert, who will visit the North Epirus area on 
Saturday and Sunday, will promote the government positions on 
these issues by fully understanding his responsibility in 
handling similar issues. Evert's visit is for the purpose of 
receiving a direct and on-the-spot briefing regarding the 
problems faced by the Greeks in Gjirokaster, Sarande, and 
Himare. According to a New Democracy statement, Evert will only 
ask to visit Tirana if the Greeks arrested recently in Albania 
are released.

<F P=106> [Report by Kira Adham: "Two Fronts That Upset Us"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Just two weeks after Greek Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou's trip to the United States and the 
encouraging position by U.S. President Bill Clinton toward 
Greece's role in the Balkans, the government finds itself faced 
with two open fronts at its northern border without a promise 
for swift settlement. 
  The first, of course, is the issue of Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] with the prolonged 
impasse over ways to solve it within the framework of the United 
Nations. 
  Second, there is the issue of Greek-Albanian relations, 
which 
deteriorated despite the Greek Government's intention to the 
contrary. 
  On the issue of Skopje, the government is attempting a 
spectacular turn in the negotiating process without so far 
facing any serious objection or trouble by the opposition 
parties, or by a large part of the Greek public. This means the 
government appears willing and ready to discuss, still under 
Cyrus Vance's auspices, the issue of Skopje in its entirety, in 
one phase, including the final name, and of course under two 
conditions: 

  -  The Greek countermeasures will remain in 
effect. 
  -  Possible secondary agreements during the negotiations 
will not depend on the achievement of an overall agreement on 
the issue, which will include a solution to the name issue. 
  This spectacular turn attempted by the Greek 
Government--which was considered almost "inconceivable" not long 
ago--was helped during the prime minister's talks at the White 
House. From the two leaders' official statements after their 
long private talks, it became evident that the two sides agree 
that there should be a new way to "approach" the issue, so that 
the differences between Athens and Skopje will smooth out and 
the negotiating process will be maintained. [passage omitted] 
  With the new process formula under discussion, both sides 
could maintain the maximum of their demands. 
  FYROM President Kiro Gligorov could claim that his demand 
for 
negotiations on all issues has been accepted, while Athens could 
insist on the implementation of its measures until Skopje meets 
the conditions it has set (constitution-flag-propaganda) before 
lifting them. 
  The "secret" of this approach--if it is finally adopted--is 
that it offers Gligorov all the time he needs until the 
critical, for him, elections in the fall, while at the same time 
it allows Athens to maintain an active, but more relaxed, 
process of negotiations in New York. 
  It is more than obvious that Athens seeks relaxation in the 
issue of Skopje, since a swift solution of the issue is not 
possible. On the contrary, and despite its desires, the Greek 
Government faces a serious deterioration in its relations with 
Tirana that does not appear about to subside as long as Albanian 
President Sali Berisha's side systematically attempts unilateral 
provocations, which, however, for the time being fall flat. 
  The recent meeting in Zurich between Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias and Albanian counterpart Alfred Serreqi did 
not produce anything substantial toward diffusion of the crisis. 
  Tirana's official statements and Berisha's remarks prove 
that 
the Albanian Government attempts, at least orally, to present 
Greece as the number one "threat" to its security. Furthermore, 
it insists on superficial diplomatic acts on the international 
scene which have already been absorbed and which have led 
foreign governments friendly to Tirana to "advise" it to 
decrease its offensive tones toward Athens. 
  Despite all that, Tirana appears determined to "play with 
Athens' nerves" by exerting obvious pressure on the Greek 
minority but also with disguised, but perhaps very serious, 
pressure on the Albanian Orthodox Church and especially on 
Archbishop Anastasios. 
  Maybe Tirana's continued provocative stance does not target 
the Greek Government, which does not seem willing to depart from 
its very calm policy toward Albania. It possibly targets the 
"sensitive nerves" of the opposition parties such as New 
Democracy and Political Spring. 
  "Angry" or even extreme statements and reaction by 
opposition 
parties will give Tirana the opportunity to claim that the 
current government's calm policy is not a stable factor in 
Greece's policy toward Albania, and therefore Tirana has every 
reason to "be afraid" of the future regarding the Greek 
intentions toward it. 
  The tour by Miltiadhis Evert, official opposition and New 
Democracy chairman, to the Greek minority areas of Albania [7-8 
May] will perhaps be a very good opportunity to reject and 
dispel all the above claims by Tirana. Anyway, prior to his 
tour in Albania, Evert had an in-depth, but also "discreet" 
briefing by the Foreign Ministry.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] Several commentaries on the 1995 
presidential elections have recently appeared in the Greek press. 
  Political analyst I.K. Pretenderis wrote in the 31 March 
Athens weekly magazine OIKONOMIKOS TAKHTDRHOMOS that two 
different views of the presidency are taking shape. One view 
holds that it would be "natural" for a dominant political 
personality like Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to become 
president at the end of President Konstandinos Karamanlis' term, 
whereas another holds that the president ought to be apolitical. 
According to Pretenderis, both views have merit. On the one 
hand, the election of a party leader would undoubtedly risk 
creating a "president of half of the Greeks," but a president's 
resonance also stems from the majority he receives or the party 
from which he originates. These considerations notwithstanding, 
it is generally believed that the context of the presidential 
elections will become clear only after procedures are launched 
in the spring of 1995. A view of the future will be provided in 
the June European Parliament elections and the fall municipal 
contest, which will reveal the balance of the political forces. 
If the government majority scores successes in both elections, 
the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) will enjoy more 
freedom of action in 1995: Papandreou could argue that even if 
new parliamentary elections become necessary--if he were unable 
to acquire the 180 votes from members of Parliament required for 
the presidency--he would still be strong enough to be elected 
president. However, if PASOK loses ground in the two contests, a 
recourse to parliamentary elections could be risky, Pretenderis 
contends. Even if the New Democracy (ND) and its leader, 
Miltiadhis Evert, were counting on the worsening economic 
climate to deny Papandreou a free hand in the presidential 
elections, they would not consider a Papandreou presidency a 
disaster, for with the prime minister out of the way and a 
"post-Papandreou" PASOK in power in 1997--when new parliamentary 
elections are due--the ND could handily score a victory. 
However, if it is in Evert's interest to have Papandreou as 
president, provided the ND does not vote for him, Political 
Spring leader Andonis Samaras should follow a different policy, 
Pretenderis continues. If he were to throw his party's support 
to Papandreou and thus avoid parliamentary elections, Samaras 
could claim a place in the government as his reward. While such 
a Samaras move would benefit Papandreou the most, another winner 
is Evert himself, inasmuch as an alliance between Political 
Spring and PASOK would push the former out of the center-right 
area and restore ND's unity. In Pretenderis' view, this analysis 
of the situation emphasizes the "serious arguments" for a 
Papandreou presidency, less because the prime minister seeks it 
than because all the others may desire it. 
  Writing in the 10 April Athens daily I KATHIMERINI, regular 
contributor Stamos Zoulas weighs Papandreou's chances to reach 
the presidency. To succeed, the prime minister must do one of 
the following: 

  -  Secure the votes of Political Spring and the 
Communist Party (KKE) to reach the required 180 votes. 
  -  Attempt a 
redistribution of parliamentary seats by either canceling 
results or repeating contests to make only KKE votes 
necessary. 
  -  Declare early elections under a different electoral 
system that would give PASOK more than 180 seats. 
  -  Risk 
dissolving the Chamber of Deputies because of its inability to 
elect a president, at which time the next Parliament could elect 
him with only 151 votes, as required by the Constitution. 
  In Zoulas' view, the first version is obviously the most 
desirable one, while the others are riskier. They are 
nonetheless alternative solutions if indeed Papandreou truly 
intends to seek the presidency. 
  A number of scenarios about the "post-Papandreou" era are 
being drawn in case the prime minister decides to run for the 
presidency, writes Yiorgos Karelias in the 15 April Athens daily 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA. For instance, Papandreou himself would settle 
the succession before launching his presidential campaign. As 
the incumbent prime minister, he would have the authority to 
approve a successor beyond the circle of his rumored 
"heirs-apparent" such as Chamber of Deputies President Apostolos 
Kaklamanis or Minister to the Prime Minister Anastasios Peponis. 
Another scenario envisions Papandreou distancing himself from 
the succession issue, allowing the party to be rent by rivalries 
that only an extraordinary party congress could settle. The 
solution would then be provided by the "historical leadership," 
in this case the various "heirs-apparent." In a third scenario, 
an extraordinary and forward-looking congress would vote "with 
an eye to the future" and provide a "third solution" by electing 
a member of the "new generation." Since the last scenario is the 
"most logical," Karelias concludes, it is also the least liklely 
to occur.

  [Text] Al-Tikriti, Iraq's ambassador to Turkey and a 
relative of Saddam Husayn, said that Turkey should cooperate 
with Iraq to establish [kurulmasi--no negative as published] a 
Kurdish state in the region. 
  Ambassador al-Tikriti said: "The project of creating a 
Kurdish state incorporating Iraq and Turkey is Britain's. The 
United States supports this project." 
  He gave assurances to Turkey, saying: "If the Hammer Force 
leaves, we will not allow even a single PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] militant to take shelter in northern Iraq." 
  Iraqi Ambassador to Ankara al-Tikriti assessed the latest 
developments in the region during his visit to our paper's 
Ankara bureau. 
  Indicating that the Turkey-Iraqi oil pipeline will rust 
unless the oil is flushed out, al-Tikriti said: "Iraq owes some 
$1 billion to Turkey. We told Turkey: Take the oil in the 
pipeline to enable us to pay our debt; and moreover, do not give 
the remaining money to us in the form of foreign currency, we 
want foodstuffs. But, the United Nations will not give 
permission to Turkey. Turkey is hurt from the embargo the most. 
At present, BOTAS [Turkish Pipeline and Oil Transportation 
Company] buys oil from other countries at $19 per barrel. It 
also pays $1.50 for the transportation of each barrel. Were the 
oil pipeline open, this transportation price would not be paid. 
That is why BOTAS is losing $1 billion every year. We want to 
act within the framework of UN resolutions, but we are being 
obstructed. Because of the embargo, 4,500 children in Iraq die 
every week." 
<H5>  "Cooperation Is a Must" </H5>
  Indicating that the establishment of a Kurdish state in 
northern Iraq will considerably undermine the regional stability 
and that the real damage will be done to Turkey, al-Tikriti 
said: "This is because there are more Kurds in Turkey than in 
Iraq. The Kurds' goal is obvious. They want to set up a large 
Kurdish state in the region. They have even published maps. 
These maps were shown on one of your television programs. The 
West does not want stability in our region. Turkey and Iraq are 
face to face with a plot. The project of creating a Kurdish 
state in the region belongs to the British. The United States 
is supporting this project." 
  Indicating that Turkey and Iraq should cooperate to prevent 
the implementation of this project, al-Tikriti said: 
"Otherwise, a Kurdish state will be established." 
<H5>  Guarantee Given to Turkey </H5>
  Noting that prior to the Gulf crisis no such tension and 
disorder existed in the region, al-Tikriti said that at the time 
Iraq gave importance to Turkey's security. Asking "where was 
the PKK before the Gulf crisis?" al-Tikriti said: "The PKK will 
vanish if the Hammer Force leaves and the oil pipeline is 
opened. At present, the PKK is being protected and sheltered by 
the Kurds in northern Iraq. Ask the Hammer Force to leave. Once 
the Hammer Force leaves, our government will restore authority 
in the region. Not even one single PKK militant will remain in 
northern Iraq. PKK is a terror organization. Besides, Turkey's 
security is important to us." 
  Asked what Iraq's position towards the Kurds will be once 
the 
Hammer Force leaves, al-Tikriti replied: "We gave official 
guarantees to Ozal in the past, and later to Demirel. We told 
them that we would not oppress the Kurds."

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel left for a one-day 
working visit to Egypt this morning. In a statement at Esenboga 
Airport before his departure, Demirel said that during his 
visit, he and Egyptian President Husni Mubarak will assess the 
ways of further advancing the cooperation between the two 
countries in the bilateral and international fields. Demirel 
pointed out that both countries have the political will to 
further develop their bilateral economic relations and increase 
their volume of trade. He added that in connection with 
international problems, the two countries are in close 
solidarity at the bilateral level and with international 
organizations. 
  President Demirel pointed out that the Middle East peace 
process is advancing toward its end. Within this framework, he 
added, Turkey and Egypt, which are two important countries in 
the region, have important duties to perform. 
  Demirel said that the two countries are ready to contribute 
to the efforts to rebuild the region after the peace process 
successfully ends and to the economic cooperation efforts that 
will be made by the regional countries. 
  The president said that there are other international 
problems that fall within the joint interest of Turkey and 
Egypt. He said: Our two countries are jointly making intensive 
efforts both at the United Nations and in the Islamic Conference 
Organization for the solution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem, 
for the prevention of the attacks against our Muslim brothers 
there, and for the amelioration of their suffering. I hope that 
the talks I will hold with my brother Husni Mubarak, president 
of friendly Egypt, on all these issues will contribute to the 
relations between the two countries and to the solution of 
regional problems. 
  President Demirel will be the first high-level guest to be 
visiting Cairo since the Palestinians and Israelis signed the 
autonomy agreement. 
  At the (Kubba) palace where he will be staying, President 
Demirel will receive Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 
'abd-al-Majid and Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi separately. 
Demirel will also visit the Egyptian parliament. He will leave 
Cairo this evening. 
  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin went to Egypt together with 
the 
president. 
  The president was seen off from Esenboga Airport by Assembly 
Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk, Air Force Commander General Halit 
Burhan, Presidential Secretary General Necdet Keskinoz, Ankara 
Governor Erdogan Sahinoglu, and other officials.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has stated that only a 
political authority has the power to make a decision on the 
chief of the general staff's term in office and added that it is 
only natural that she should consider alternative arrangements 
and discuss the issue with her close colleagues. Ciller also 
stated that there have been no hints or requests from the chief 
of the general staff regarding his term in office. 
  Ciller's statement on the issue is as follows: 
  During recent days, various interpretations and reports 
concerning General Dogan Gures' term in office have appeared in 
the media. The polemics concerning the issue continue in 
certain circles. The power to make a decision on the chief of 
the general staff's term in office falls under the jurisdiction 
of the political authority. Nothing can be as natural as my 
considering an alternative arrangement or discussing the issue 
with my close colleagues. It is very wrong to interpret my 
contacts regarding this issue and my request that the issue be 
kept within a close circle as an intention to keep the issue 
secret from the government and the public. The main aim of 
these meetings was to conduct preliminary work to determine 
whether the conditions for extending Mr. Gures' term in office 
can be implemented. We did not find it necessary to inform Gen. 
Gures or anybody else. 
  During these days, when we have accomplished so much in the 
fight against terrorism, our government, determined to solve 
this issue, is serving effectively and successfully with a 
trustworthy cadre, together with other commanders. Of course, 
eradicating terrorism takes time. 
  Meanwhile, political and military developments in the region 
and the world exacerbate the current ambiguity and the risks 
originating from it. Under these conditions, we may consider it 
favorable and necessary for the country's interests to retain 
the successful command team on duty in its present form. 
However, the possibility of this arrangement having a negative 
impact on the hierarchal structure of the Turkish Armed Forces 
is an important consideration. 
  With this in mind, our government, while affirming its trust 
in the top echelons within the traditional structure of the 
Turkish Armed Forces, also fully trusts all levels of command, 
including those commanders who will have to assume the 
high-level positions when the time comes. 
  The term democratization package I refer to in my contacts 
is 
an expression always used during my exchange of views on 
national security with Gen. Gures. Our great nation is fully 
aware of the respect Gen. Gures and the Turkish Armed Forces 
under his command have for democracy and its institutions. 
  I would like to stress that absolutely no requests or hints 
have reached us from Gen. Gures regarding his term in office. 
Furthermore, we are aware that he is not predisposed in this 
regard; it is we who raised the issue. 
  Gen. Gures' statements to the press are in the spirit of the 
Turkish Armed Forces' tradition of having no personal desires 
for office. In view of all these realities, nobody will benefit 
from statements and interpretations that give way to speculation 
or polemics.

  [Text] Ankara (AA) -- President Suleyman Demirel has said 
that public discussions on the extension of the chief of staff's 
term in office are not beneficial for the country and added: I 
want these discussions to end. I have the last word on the 
issue. There is no need to conduct discussions that do not 
involve me. 
  Demirel received a delegation of ANATOLIA Agency [AA] 
administrators and representatives from other news agencies, 
headed by AA Director General Ekrem Karaismailoglu, at the 
Cankaya Mansion today. 
  Demirel replied to questions on the recent political and 
economic developments. In reply to a question on discussions 
regarding the extension of the term of office of General Gures, 
the chief of the General Staff, Demirel said that the Turkish 
Armed Forces should not be dragged into polemics through such 
discussions. Demirel continued: 
  The Armed Forces should not be put in the position of 
defending themselves, discussions should not be held on behalf 
of the Armed Forces, and a situation that will put the Armed 
Forces in such a position should not be created. I want these 
discussions, which have been going on for a few days now, to 
end. As the head of state, I am responsible for the chief of 
staff's appointment. 
  I have not yet been submitted any proposals because the time 
is not ripe. August is the month of appointments, and we have 
another four months ahead. There is no need for discussions 
four months in advance. Let the time come, and we shall 
consider. What shall we consider when the time comes? We shall 
consider the country's interests. What shall we consider? We 
shall consider the legal aspects. If the legal requirements do 
not lend themselves to an extension, these current discussions 
will have been futile. If a new law is enacted, it is a 
different matter. These discussions, however, are futile. The 
issue will be considered at the appropriate time. 
  Demirel stated that there is no such thing as 
irreplaceability in the Armed Forces. Recalling that the 
request to extend the terms of the GATA [Gulhane Academy of 
Military Medicine] commanders was rejected at the Supreme 
Military Council meeting held in March, Demirel added: 
  The Armed Forces are the apple of our country's eye. The 
stronger they are, the better off we are. The strength of the 
Armed Forces rests on the fact that they do not depend on the 
irreplaceability of individuals. An institution whose officers 
have not become irreplaceable, an institution where new 
appointments can be made and the newcomers can perform their 
duties with efficiency is a strong institution. This was the 
reason for the decision made at the council's March meeting. As 
to the decision to be made when the time comes in August, it 
will be made in line with Turkey's interests. 
  Demirel stated that the inclination of the Armed Forces is 
in 
line with the council's decision. Demirel said: Let these 
discussions end. I have the last word on the issue. There is 
no need to conduct discussions that do not involve me. Let us 
close this matter. All issues can be discussed in Turkey. I, 
however, am not convinced that futile discussions are beneficial 
for the country.

  [Text] Ankara, May 7 (AA) -- President Suleyman Demirel on 
Saturday [7 May] said the discussions on the extension of the 
duty of Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan Gures are totally absolutely 
unnecessary, untimely and inappropriate when there are still 
four months until Gures's time of duty is up. 
  In a written statement, Demirel said that when the time 
comes, necessary procedures will be done following the 
government's proposition and in line with the Constitution and 
the laws. 
  "However," he said, "that will be a posting and not an 
approval. The power of accepting the government's proposal 
belongs to the president." 
  Demirel said in the statement that the Turkish Republic is a 
constitutional and legislative state, where everyone's duty and 
authority is determined by the Constitution and the laws. 
  "The chief of staff's appointment and the procedure when his 
duty ends, are all determined by the Constitution and the laws," 
he said, adding that clauses number 117 and 104 give the power 
to appoint the chief of staff to the president. 
  "The presidency represents the high commander at the Turkish 
Armed Forces [TAF] in the name of the Grand National Assembly," 
he said, adding these speculations can hurt the TAF, and they 
should be stopped. 
  "I would like all to know that when the time comes, 
everything necessary will be done in line with the Constitution 
and the laws," he concluded. 
  A scandal broke out in the society this week when a man 
listened to a three-way telephone conversation between Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller and two cabinet members. The 
conversation, recorded because one of the ministers was talking 
from the telephone in his car, was issued in one of the dailies. 
In the conversation, Ciller was asking her ministers to make 
necessary arrangements to extend the duty of Chief of Staff 
General Gures for another year. 
  On Friday, a written statement published by the Prime 
Minister's Office said that the polemics concerning the issue 
have been continuing in certain circles and the press, adding 
the power for duty extension of the chief of staff, General 
Dogan Gures, belongs totally to the political authority. 
  Earlier the same day, President Suleyman Demirel said that 
he 
was the one who will say the last say on the extension of the 
duty of General Gures.

  [Text] Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime

on the extension of the chief of staff's term in office. 
Stating that only the government has the right to extend the 
chief of staff's term, Karayalcin added that his term will be 
extended if it is deemed necessary; if not, it will not be 
extended. 
  According to information obtained by TRT correspondent 
Mustafa Cevik, Karayalcin was answering correspondents questions 
on board a plane on his way to Sanliurfa. In answer to a 
question on whether the chief of staff's term will be extended, 
Karayalcin said: 
  [Begin Karayalcin recording] When an issue of this kind is 
discussed, it should be brief and to the point. In the letter 
the chief of the staff sent to me concerning these discussions, 
he clearly states that he has no requests regarding his term in 
office. I think that these discussions should be ended. [end 
recording] 
  In answer to another question, Karayalcin said the 
democratization package has not yet been approved. Referring to 
speculations regarding this issue, Karayalcin said: You cannot 
hold discussions on a package that is not ready. How can I or 
Prime Minister Ciller discuss the democratization package with 
other people if it is not ready yet?

  [Text] Ankara, May 6 (A.A.) -- Chief of Staff General 
Dogan Gures told the Anatolian Agency on Friday [6 May] that the 
polemics on the extension of duty for the chief of staff should 
be searched for outside his office. 
  Gures said he has explained his opinion on the issue on many 
occasions, adding that when the time comes to transfer duty, 
`those who conduct this duty with honor, hand it over to the 
next commander with pride. I have already said this is how it 
will happen, weeks ago at a meeting where the highest government 
officials were present.' 
  He said there is always available personnel for every post 
in 
the Turkish Armed Forces. 
  `In the armed forces, no one can expect any favor and one 
does not accept any,' Gures said adding that one refrains as 
much as possible from showing negative intentions. 
  He also thanked Prime Minister Tansu Ciller who made a 
statement on the issue. 
  Earlier on Friday, Ciller said that the authority to extend 
the term of duty of the chief of staff belongs entirely to the 
political authority. 
  A statement published by the Office of the Prime Ministry 
said that `we may see it profitable and necessary for the 
country's well being, to preserve the present command team on 
duty under its present shape.'

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "Generals Should Stick to Their </F>
Duties"] 
  [Text] Very recently we commented that Gen. Dogan Gures, 
the current chief of staff of the Turkish Armed Forces who will 
retire in the summer of 1994 due to the official age limit of 67 
and because he has completed four years in office, should not be 
speaking on domestic issues and should keep away from daily 
politics. 
  Ever since our comments appeared in the Turkish Daily News 
we 
have received much support from all quarters. As a matter of 
fact, new developments came to the surface regarding Gen. Gures 
which only proved our point. 
  There were rumors that Gen. Gures attended a dinner recently 
with businessmen and there he allegedly made comments about the 
formation of a new government dominated by technical experts. 
The news broke when Culture Minister Fikri Saglar, the new 
secretary general of the coalition partner Social Democrat 
People's Party (SHP), told a newspaper that Gen. Gures should 
disclose whether or not these claims were true. 
  This development came amid reports that Gen. Gures was 
seeking new ways to have his term of office extended for another 
year. There were also reports that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller 
also wanted such an extension. 
  At a separate press conference Saglar also said the SHP was 
against the extension of the term of office of Gen. Gures and 
the commanders of the Navy and Air Forces. 
  So the General Staff made a statement on Sunday [3 May] 
saying the military was not the body to set up governments in 
Turkey. The statement also said laws and regulations were clear 
about the appointment and retirement of military personnel and 
called the press reports absurd. 
  Yet those of us who remember how coups come and go in Turkey 
and the controversial way the chief of staff's term in office 
was extended last year amid cries of foul play were not too 
impressed. 
  Actually the chief of staff himself could not remain silent 
despite the General Staff statement and had to make rather 
awkward statements which showed either his lack of knowledge of 
a true democracy or his lack of interest in it. 
  Gen. Gures criticized Saglar and said the politician did not 
know the state hierarchy. He said the extension of the term of 
office of force commanders was made when the chief of staff made 
an offer and the minister of defense, the prime minister and the 
president approved this. "When did he (Saglar) become a prime 
minister? I didn't know he was in the state hierarchy." It 
seems the chief of staff is unaware that his boss is the 
civilian government which is a coalition government and the SHP 
is a partner to it. Thus the SHP and its officials have a say 
in whatever happens. This is a sad fact of democracy which a 
military person is obliged to know. 
  On Tuesday Saglar also made a statement reminding the chief 
of staff of the facts of democracy. 
  The chief of staff has recently said everyone should take 
pains to avoid any controversies about the office of the chief 
of staff as it may erode this very important post. We agree. 
Yet, the chief of staff himself should be beyond all kinds of 
controversy. 
  Now, he may ban Fikri Saglar from entering the General Staff 
headquarters as he did the Turkish Daily News. But this is all 
a passing phase. Military commanders come and go while we are 
here to stay. 
  One day Gen. Gures and a handful of his men will go. We have 
no hard feelings toward the Armed Forces because we are aware 
there are very valuable and competent generals and admirals in 
the Turkish Armed Forces who could and will replace them and the 
military will function with great success. 
  Gen. Gures will one day be an ordinary citizen. Then he can 
say whatever he likes and we can assure him we will be on hand 
to defend him to the bitter end against all unjustified attacks. 
Today, every word from him is plunging the Armed Forces deeper 
into a fruitless and damaging controversy. We oppose this 
because we feel the good name of the Turkish Armed Forces has to 
be preserved at all costs.

  [Text] RAF [Royal Air Force] Hercules crews were tonight on 
stand-by to fly out to the Middle East to help rescue Britons 
trapped by the civil war in Yemen. 
  Up to 800 were believed stranded by the fighting which broke 
out on Friday after the failure of efforts to unite the old 
states of North and South Yemen. 
  Sixty-four Britons were among the 577 foreigners taken on 
board the French warship Jules Verne earlier today in the former 
southern capital of Aden. They were taken to the Red Sea port 
of Djibouti, a former French colony. 
  The Foreign Office said that they were expecting the ship to 
return to Aden -- where about a third of the Britons are based 
-- to continue the evacuation. The rest of the ex-patriate 
community is split between the capital Sanaa and oil fields. 
  A Foreign Office spokesman said contingency plans to 
evacuate 
Sanaa were under consideration -- including the use of Hercules 
from RAF Lynham to airlift the British nationals. 
  With overland routes out of the country severed by the 
fighting, the Americans were also reported to be considering an 
airlift to rescue Western nationals in the city. 
  Sanaa radio said five Scud missiles were fired "in a 
cowardly 
attack" at public utilities in the capital this morning. 
However there were no injuries and no damage and the city was 
later reported to be quiet. 
  Foreigners were being advised to remain in their homes. 
  Among the Britons trapped in the city were the 14 crew of a 
British Airways [BA] DC10 flight which flew in on Tuesday night. 
  They were due to return to Gatwick tonight after being 
replaced by a relief crew during the stopover. A BA spokesman 
said they were staying at the Sheraton Hotel while waiting to 
get out. 
  "They are safe and well and in good spirits. They have got 
adequate food and supplies and they have reported that there has 
been no damage to the hotel," he said. 
  He said that when the flight went in on Tuesday there had 
been no warning that the situation was about to deteriorate. 
The airline also has eight ground staff in the city.

  [Excerpts] Silvio Berlusconi has almost reached his goal. 
A final agreement on the new government was reached last night. 
[passage omitted] Mauro Mazza reports: 
  [Mazza] Berlusconi's dream may become reality. There has 
been speculation since last night that Antonio Di Pietro will 
become interior minister. Maybe it is only a coincidence, but 
the prosecutor was in Rome this morning to meet with his 
colleague Saviotti. There are rumors that Di Pietro and 
Berlusconi met before the prime minister-designate went to the 
Quirinale [office of the president] at 1130. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, other problems were apparently solved at last 
night's summit: 
  [Roberto] Maroni [Nothern League] and Giuseppe Tatarella 
[Italian Social Movement--MSI] will be deputy prime ministers. 
Maroni will also be justice minister, and Tatarella will also be 
minister of posts and telecommunications. 
  Antonio Martino [Forza Italia] will be foreign minister. 
  Lamberto Dini [no party affiliation] will be given the 
Treasury. 
  [Giulio] Tremonti, former member of the Pact for Italy, will 
be finance minister. 
  [Ombretta] Fumagalli Carulli [Christian Democratic 
Center-CCD] will be minister of education. 
  [Giancarlo] Pagliarini [Northern League] will be budget 
minister. 
  Leoni will be given the Ministry of Public Works. 
  [Publio] Fiori [MSI] will be transport minister. 
  [Domenico] Fisichella [no party affiliation] will be 
minister 
for cultural heritage. 
  [Gianni] Letta [a journalist] will be undersecretary to the 
presidency of the council. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Erik Bjorn Moller and Hendrik Qvortrup: "The </F>
Christian Democrats Hold the Balance"] 
  [Text] The strategy is clear. 
  The Christian People's Party intends to copy the Radical 
Liberals' old trick. The Christian People's Party is about to 
try to become the party that holds the balance of power. 
  For if one thing was clear after last week's many 
maneuverings at Christiansborg, it was the Christian People's 
Party's great need to underline its freedom. And therefore its 
influence. 
  And in Kolding this line was given the full backing of the 
party's national conference that has just come to an end. 
  For while no one has any doubts at all about the Radical 
Liberals' wholehearted ties with Nyrup Rasmussen, the Christian 
People's Party's leading politicians are now consciously 
avoiding choosing sides prior to the upcoming Folketing election. 
  Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social Democratic Party) must take 
nothing for granted -- nor should Hans Engell (Conservative 
People's Party) or Uffe Ellemann-Jensen (Liberal Party) for that 
matter. 
  The advantage of this tactic is obvious -- just ask the 
Radical Liberals: If you have not taken sides in advance it is 
easier to make demands. 
  On Saturday [30 April] the Christian People's Party drew an 
advance on the profits from its newly proclaimed key position in 
Danish politics. 
  With self-confidence and boldness the party's leading 
politicians put the Social Democrats and Prime Minister Poul 
Nyrup Rasmussen under pressure when they issued an ultimatum in 
BERLINGSKE TIDENDE demanding concessions in the field of child 
care in return for continued support for the Social Democrat-led 
government. 
  The question is whether throughout a long election campaign 
the Christian People's Party will be able to remain firm on not 
giving the voters a clear answer to the question of where its 
loyalties lie. In the past -- in the run-up to the election in 
1988 -- the Radical Liberals have learned the painful lesson of 
what happens when you do not make your position very clear in an 
election campaign. 
  Henning Lysholm Christensen, the Christian People's Party's 
Folketing group chairman, admits that it could be difficult: 
  "We will without doubt be subjected to great pressure to 
make 
our position clear -- but we will hold out," he said by way of 
guarantee. 
  The party will now use the next month to bring to a close 
the 
Folketing year and consequently round off the work of the 
present government. 
  After that political work will in reality come to an end -- 
and then the election campaign can begin in earnest. Then it is 
simply a case of making the party visible to the voters. 
Particularly in Ribe and Ringkobing districts where Christian 
People's Party skepticism toward government cooperation with the 
Social Democratic Party has been greatest. 
  The new Christian People's Party demand for changes in the 
field of child care is therefore unlikely to be the last issue 
on which the little center party adopts a position of its own. 
More demonstrations are to be expected -- and of each one of 
them it will be possible to say with complete certainty: They 
will definitely not make life easier for Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. 
  Even if the prime minister has not as yet commented on the 
various statements from the Christian People's Party, there can 
be no doubt that the party's behavior is being analyzed 
thoroughly at the Prime Minister's Office. 
  There was an indication recently that leading Social 
Democratic ministers have respect for the little party with its 
four Folketing seats when after several months of pressure 
Justice Minister Erling Olsen (Social Democratic Party) bowed to 
Merethe Due Jensen and Inger Stilling Pedersen who pushed 
successfully for a new law against child pornography. 
  In doing so the minister made himself very unpopular with 
one 
of the other small parties in the government, the Radical 
Liberals. 
  However, Erling Olsen made no secret of the fact that the 
change in the law is due to consideration of the Christian 
People's Party in particular. 
  It is particularly significant that the Social Democrats are 
doing a lot to comply with the Christian People's Party. They 
are doing so to maintain the links with the Christian People's 
Party, which at regular intervals has voiced doubts about 
government cooperation. 
  The Social Democrats know from bitter experience that the 
Christian People's Party is a much more uncertain partner than 
the Radical Liberals. [Radical Liberal leader] Jelved's troops 
thus now seem to be more determined than ever to continue the 
close cooperation with the Social Democratic Party. And Nyrup 
Rasmussen does not therefore need to expend so much of his 
energies in that quarter. 
  There can be no doubt that Jann Sjursen, the Christian 
People's Party chairman and energy minister, will now use the 
coming months up to the election to take soundings to find out 
who will help his party to get the largest number of their 
flagship issues implemented. 
  For once election day is over, the young party leader will 
in 
all probability find himself in the stressful situation of 
having to decide in a matter of a few hours which prime 
ministerial candidate the party will back. 
  And then what's done is done. 
  And then the little party's freedom will be nothing to write 
home about.

  [Text] The United Nations does not see prospects for 
success in the efforts for implementation of the 
confidence-building measures [CBMs], and for this reason it is 
not willing to grant an extension to this process. Reliable UN 
sources told CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] that from 
the contacts held after [UN Secretary General's special 
representative on Cyprus] Joe Clark's departure from Cyprus 
there was no evidence or developments that justify an extension 
to the process. The same sources also noted that in view of 
this situation, there is no plan to call a meeting in New York 
between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot leader 
Rauf Denktas. 
  Attention is now focused on the preparation and presentation 
of the UN secretary general's report to the Security Council in 
which the events will be reported objectively. Furthermore, the 
same UN source rejected Denktas' accusations and the British 
side's views that there were changes in the original package of 
the confidence-building measures. The UN sources clarified that 
the package of measures refers to the outline, whereas the 21 
March document refers to the ways to implement the measures. 
They also noted that the 21 March document includes serious 
improvements which are almost all to the Turkish Cypriots' 
benefit.

during which they agreed on the need for a speedy solution of 
the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] 
issue. During the telephone conversation, the U.S. President 
also expressed his support for the confidence-building measures 
for the Cyprus issue which, he said, are the best hope to 
achieve progress. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described the U.S. 
interest in a solution to the Greek-Skopje dispute as obvious. 
Venizelos added that the Ubited States understands the Greek 
positions and wants a swift solution of the issue, something 
which we want as well. 
  Next week there will be a meeting in New York between 
Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry director

  [Text] Commenting on rumors of a murder attempt against 
his life, the Archbishop of Albania Anastasios stressed in a 
statement that for 33 months, under particularly difficult 
conditions, he has been touring through Albania to revive the 
Orthodox Church without any protection at all. The love and 
prayers of hundreds of thousands of Orthodox and thousands of 
other friends are enough, said Archbishop Anastasios. The 
Archbishop of Albania also stressed that the truth will finally 
shine and his work will remain as proof of honesty, love, and 
solidarity among the peoples. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today referred to 
the statement of Archbishop Anastasios and stressed that the 
archbishop of Tirana and the whole of Albania always acts on 
behalf of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. The Greek 
Government, said the spokesman, is clearly very interested in 
the rights of the Greek minority in Albania, which is Orthodox 
Christian in religion. In this sense, the spokesman stressed, 
we are interested in the smooth operation and exercise of rights 
by the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church to a degree which 
includes the religious and worship needs of the Greek minority.

  [Text] Ankara, 6 May (MENA)--Turkish President Suleyman 
Demirel has affirmed that the objectives of the upcoming 
bilateral meetings with President Husni Mubarak are to establish 
joint cooperation between the two countries and to formulate a 
general framework on this subject. 
  In an exclusive interview with the MENA correspondent in 
Ankara dealing with his visit to Egypt, which will begin 
tomorrow, Saturday [7 May], the Turkish president said that the 
resources of Egypt and Turkey could together contribute to 
establishing peace and stability in the Middle East. 
  Demirel added that he agreed with President Mubarak to 
eliminate all barriers and protocols and to meet at any time. 
They also agreed to stay in continuous contact to negotiate 
various bilateral and international issues of mutual interest. 
  President Demirel said that both he and President Mubarak 
realize their important responsibilities since Egypt and Turkey 
have so much influence on the course of events in the Middle 
East and can preserve security and stability in the region. 
  He added that if Egypt is considered a gateway to Africa, 
Turkey is considered a gateway to the Islamic republics in 
Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Europe. 
  In his speech, Demirel praised President Husni Mubarak's 
wisdom in overcoming the problem that emerged during the 
ceremony held in Cairo on Wednesday to sign the Israeli-PLO 
Agreement. 
  He clarified that he telephoned President Mubarak to 
congratulate him on his wisdom, which saved the agreement from 
collapse before it even started. 
  President Demirel said that we consider the agreement signed 
by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo an important step in 
establishing peace. We believe it will pave the way for and 
open the door to the aspired for peace. 
  The Turkish president said in his interview with the MENA 
correspondent in Ankara that when peace is established in the 
Middle East we can then benefit from the large potential in the 
region. 
  Demirel added that after the former Soviet Union collapsed, 
the independent Islamic republics emerged, which Egypt and 
Turkey are cooperating with in various social, cultural, and 
economic fields to serve them. 
  Answering a question on the Egyptian-Turkish-Saudi economic 
cooperation, Demirel said that the Israeli-PLO agreement, which 
was signed on Wednesday in Cairo, will make it easy to realize 
this cooperation. In this regard, he affirmed that Egypt and 
Turkey have very good relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
  On the Turkish role in the Middle East peace process, 
President Demirel said that Turkey has very good relations with 
Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel. 
  He added that relations with Israel were limited until Egypt 
and Israel signed the peace treaty that opened the door to 
Turkey to develop relations with Israel. 
  The Turkish president said that contacts between his country 
and Israel continue. He pointed out that it is possible during 
the coming stage to establish peace agreements between Israel 
and Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. 
  On the Turkish stance regarding the idea of a Middle East 
common market, President Demirel said that he believes such a 
market can be established in time. However, he noted that a 
common market requires certain developments in the region, such 
as the return of Iraq to the international community. 
  He said that Iraq's return to the international community is 
not Turkey's idea alone, but that some leaders of Islamic 
countries share it. 
  Demirel affirmed that Iraq's return to the international 
community as soon as possible could open the opportunity of 
launching the concept of the Middle Eastern market. However, he 
said that he does not know how Iraq's return should be handled. 
  On the international sanctions imposed on Iraq, the Turkish 
president said these sanctions have not affected the Iraqi 
Government or Iraqi President Saddam Husayn but the Iraqi 
people, who are suffering from the shortage of their basic needs 
of medicine and food. He added that Turkey has also suffered as 
a result of these sanctions, noting that its losses since the 
outbreak of the Gulf War have reached approximately $20 billion. 
  Asked about the differences between Ankara and Washington 
over the repair of the Iraqi oil pipeline passing through 
Turkey, President Demirel said his country is losing 
approximately $4 billion annually as a result of the closure of 
this pipeline. For this reason Turkey calls for the economic 
blockade of Iraq to be lifted as a way of overcoming Turkey's 
economic problems. He explained that the nonuse of the Iraqi 
pipeline for an extended amount of time will damage it. He said 
he is confident that in the next few days officials in 
Washington will realize the need for carrying out maintenance 
work on this pipeline. 
  Regarding the water problem, President Demirel explained 
that 
the Euphrates River also passes through Syria and Iraq. He said 
Turkey is building 12 dams on the river to regulate its water 
flow. He said his country has not yet begun the full 
exploitation of these waters for generating electricity or for 
agriculture. He said he hopes that Turkey will begin 
exploiting these waters for generating electricity after these 
dams are completed. He stressed that Turkey has no intention of 
depriving neighboring countries of water. 
  Regarding the differences between Turkey and Greece, Demirel 
accused Greece of providing shelter for the supporters of the 
banned Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]. 
  He said Turkey does not object to a solution of the Cyprus 
problem provided it is not an imposed solution. This is because 
there are at least 150,000 Muslim citizens in the Turkish sector 
of Cyprus while the Greek community lives in the other sector. 
He added that an imposed solution on either party will not be 
permanent and comprehensive. Therefore, there is a need for 
dialogue. 
  Regarding the political solution proposed by some European 
countries for the problem in southeast Turkey, President 
Demirel condemned all acts of terrorism, describing them as a 
human crime abhorred by religion and society. He said Turkey 
cannot hold a dialogue with a terrorist band or organization 
that kills innocent civilians. He added that no political 
solution can be reached with a terrorist organization under any 
pressure because the PKK uses terrorism. He said we will not 
negotiate with terrorists and will not compromise on Turkey's 
territorial unity. 
  On Turkey's role in solving the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem, 
Demirel said Turkey has offered all it can in terms of aid and 
contacts with Bosnian officials to reach a solution to this 
crisis. 
  On the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Demirel said 
Armenia continually commits aggression on Azerbaijani territory. 
He called for a halt to these aggressive acts. He added that 
Turkey gives every kind of aid to Azerbaijan to repulse these 
attacks.

  [Text] France Info interviewed the commander of the French 
forces in Djibouti, Colonel Gandouli. The airlift between 
Djibouti and Sanaa to evacuate Westerners -- among them the 200 
or 300 French nationals still living in the Yemeni capital -- is 
continuing. 
  [Begin recording] [Gandouli] Operation Diapason 2 was 
launched today. Its aim is to evacuate those nationals based in 
Sanaa wishing to leave Sanaa. We set up an airlift between 
Djibouti and Sanaa to evacuate these nationals. We have two 
Transall [Air Force cargo planes] currently shuttling between 
Djibouti and Sanaa. Two Italian aircraft should join them 
tomorrow to reinforce this airlift. 
  [Correspondent Isabelle Dorre] Are there many French 
nationals wishing to leave Sanaa? 
  [Gandouli] I believe between 200 and 250 have asked to 
leave. 
  [Dorre] Will they stay in Djibouti or will they return to 
France? 
  [Gandouli] As far as I know they will return to France. Some 
80 percent of all the nationals we welcomed yesterday left for 
France on an Air France flight or for other destinations on 
Lufthansa, Aeroflot, or Italian aircraft. If more European 
Union nationals or other nationals were to ask to be evacuated 
to Djibouti, we would naturally evacuate them within the limits 
of our capacities. There are not only French aircraft, but also 
two German planes flying back and forth between Djibouti and 
Sanaa. 
  [Dorre] You have met people who came back from Sanaa. What 
did they say about the situation on the ground? 
  [Gandouli] The situation was tense at one point, but the 
situation in Sanaa itself is not dangerous now. 
  [Dorre] Are there other evacuation operations under way? 
  [Gandouli] The evacuation operation is called Diapason. 
There is a Diapason 1 operation under way, it is mainly using 
naval means, including helicopters, to evacuate nationals from 
Yemen's southern coast. The Diapason 2 operation is mainly a 
Djibouti-Sanaa airlift to evacuate nationals from Sanaa. [end

  [Excerpts] In Yemen, the civil war is raging and there is 
extremely violent fighting at this very moment between 
government troops and rebel forces, the northerners and the 
southerners, near Aden. [passage omitted] 
  Here is an exclusive interview with Admiral Jean-Luc 
Delaunay, a top officer in the French Navy in the Indian Ocean. 
He spoke to Fabrice Le Quintrec from the ship Le Var: 
  [Begin recording] [Delaunay] We evacuated 300 people from 
Aden today and 200 people from Al Mukalla, a small port 500 km 
from Aden, including a group of French tourists. We have four 
ships taking part in the operation: A repair ship, an oil 
tanker, a landing craft, and a dispatch boat, which we have 
brought from the Persian Gulf. All this is taking place without 
any panic because the harbor authorities in the aforementioned 
ports are making things easy for us. Meanwhile, the French Army 
evacuated about 250 people from Sanaa, whom they sent to 
Djibouti. 
  [Le Quintrec] Admiral, how many French or foreign nationals 
remain to be evacuated from Yemen? 
  [Delaunay] We believe that there are very few French 
nationals and European nationals in Aden. We believe that there 
are about 30 French nationals, whom we will evacuate tomorrow 
morning. 
  [Le Quintrec] Are you going to stay in the area for a long 
time? 
  [Delaunay] No, it will mainly depend on the number of French 
nationals. If we manage to evacuate these last French nationals 
tomorrow -- and only the French consul in Aden will be able to 
tell us -- there is no reason why we should prolong our stay 
beyond then since we will have accomplished our mission. [end

  [Text] The Bosnian Serbs have decided to extend by one 
month the preventive detention of 11 French people from the aid 
organization Premiere Urgence, French Ambassador to Bosnia Henri 
Jacolin has just said. According to the diplomat, three Serb 
judges took the decision in order to prolong the investigation 
which is not yet over. The date of the trial has not yet been 
set, Henri Jacolin added. 
  Alain Juppe was the guest on Radio France Culture this 
morning. He came out in favor of a withdrawal of French UN 
troops within a reasonable time limit, should there be no real 
progress toward peace. Alain Juppe: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] Today we have to make peace. 
France's aim is to act in such a way as to arrive at a peace 
settlement, a settlement that has to be based on a compromise. 
We have defined this compromise in a plan known as the European 
Union plan of action, which amounts to saying that we have to 
keep Bosnia as a state, that, within this Bosnia, each of the 
three communities must be able to administer itself as freely as 
possible, setting up a confederal or federal system of 
institutions, and designating territories. 
  The sides have given their agreement to this outline, and 
that is what we are trying to do. We are not managing it at the 
moment, and I am very worried about the deterioration of the 
situation on the ground, and the way the diplomatic process is 
getting bogged down. 
  We have to know that if we don't get there within a 
reasonable time, if this peace process cannot really get off the 
ground, if the great powers are not really ready to say to the 
belligerents -- Now you have to stop the war, and here are the 
conditions we propose in order to stop it -- I think France will 
change its attitude. It won't be able to keep UN troops on the 
ground indefinitely under the current circumstances, if there 
are no prospects for peace. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F>
correspondent Annette Ardisson; from the "Questions From A to B" 
program -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ardisson] Let us move on to 
another serious subject, Bosnia. France already feels concern, 
shared by the United States, over the region of Brcko, which, 
one should mention, is the narrowest part of the corridor 
linking the Serbian enclaves together, and then there is also 
this matter of the tanks that the UN forces have allowed past 
into the exclusion zone around Sarajevo. In terms of symbols 
this is quite a strong one, what use is it for France to supply 
so many peacekeeping troops to the United Nations if its voice 
is not heeded? 
  [Juppe] The question arises, and you are right to ask it. 
You know that for a year now we have made considerable efforts 
to attempt to make progress toward a solution. Today, I am 
concerned for two reaaons. First of all, because of the 
situation on the ground: Our troops, our peacekeeping troops, 
are extraordinarily vulnerable, and I am not certain that the 
force that we have established by means of the UN Security 
Council resolutions and NATO ultimatums is working as it should. 
In fact, we need firmness on the ground, and this firmness is 
absent. I regret to say that, as you have pointed out, we are 
likely to encounter new setbacks at Brcko, if we are too weak 
and take too long as was the case in Gorazde. 
  The second matter for concern is that the diplomatic process 
is likely to become bogged down again. As you know, personally, 
I wanted a negotiating group involving Americans, Russians, and 
Europeans to be formed. This has been done, but what do I see? 
This group moves about between the different sides to question 
them -- this has been going on for months now -- and no progress 
is being made. So, I have come to a point where I say that we 
now have to tackle the basic question, and the basic question is 
as follows: Do we or do we not want to make peace in Bosnia, or 
do we want to make the different sides believe that the war is 
going to continue? If we want to make peace then we have to 
provide ourselves with the means, in other words: Here is the 
settlement we are putting to you, and it must be accepted. If 
we are unable to get this line accepted -- and the deadline is 
close, early next week there will be a meeting at ministerial 
level -- then we will have to draw the appropriate conclusions. 
We cannot continue to expose our peacekeeping troops to danger 
indefinitely if it is not serving any useful purpose. 
  [Ardisson] What conclusions, please be more specific? 
  [Juppe] I believe I have been quite specific enough, and 
that 
everyone has understood my meaning. 
  [Ardisson] There is another issue, that of Premiere Urgence 
and of its 11 French members who are being held hostage. You 
said: We will be firm, it is out of the question to bargain. 
However, what means do we have of exerting pressure on the 
Serbs without giving anything in return so as to obtain the 
freedom of these French nationals. 
  [Juppe] They have been set up. I will not go back over the 
details, but we know perfectly well that there was a scheme to 
make people believe that this organization was involved in arms 
smuggling. We cannot accept a mockery of a trial. We cannot 
accept a bargain with some being freed and others being tried. 
We have multiplied steps to obtain the freeing of our fellow 
nationals through international organizations, through the 
European Union Presidency, through certain influential 
diplomatic channels, namely the Russians. Serb authorities must 
know that we hold them responsible for what might happen. I 
mean the authorities in Belgrade. One cannot play a constant 
double game and tell us that it is not them but the others. 
When the UN secretary general is negotiating a cease-fire with 
the Bosnian Serbs, he does so in Belgrade, this is where things 
are taking place. If our demands for a total and speedy freeing 
of our nationals are not met, it must be clear that France will 
never accept the implementation of a process aimed at lifting 
sanctions against Serbia. Things must be clear. 
  [Ardisson] Is this the only means we have to exert pressure? 
  [Juppe] This is a major one and we will naturally employ all 
others as well. [passage omitted]

  Here is the reaction of government spokesman Nicolas

He was the guest of the RTL program Le Monde: 
  [Begin Sarkozy recording] What can one say? We can only bow 
before the pain felt by the families and tell you that Algeria 
is now one of the main concerns of the prime minister. If we 
had the time to talk about this longer, the situation in the

special relationship with Algeria, we are close to Algeria 
geographically and historically. It is definitely one of the 
major concerns of the government at the moment. [end recording] 
  [Amar] Paris has advised all French nationals residing in 
Algeria to leave the country. It must be pointed out that the 
list of foreigners who are the victims of Islamic attacks is 
getting longer: 34 foreign nationals have been killed since 
September 1993, including 10 French nationals. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "France and Japan Reaffirm Firmness </F>
Toward Pyongyang"] 
  [Text] France and Japan intend to stand firm on the 
"nuclear" crisis between North Korea and the United Nations. 
However, Japan wishes that "the door be left open for 
negotiations." The risks created by North Korea's nuclear 
policy were among the main topics addressed on Wednesday, 4 May 
by Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata in his successive 
meetings with Francois Mitterrand, Jacques Chirac, and Edouard 
Balladur. 
  Mr. Hata reiterated that his country agrees with the 
statement issued last month by the Security Council, which 
threatened with economic sanctions against North Korea should it 
persist in refusing international inspectors access to its 
nuclear facilities. According to Mr. Hata, Japan has asked China 
to use its influence to get North Korea to come to terms. 
  Mr. Hata raised the issue of Japan becoming a permanent 
member of the UN Security Council. He reminded his hosts that 
France has been in favor of this notion and, more generally, 
would like Japan to play a more prominent role in world affairs. 
  The Japanese prime minister also agreed that "it is not a 
healthy state of affairs when a single country" (like Japan) 
"has a trade surplus," adding that Tokyo "is attempting to open 
its market to the world." In office since 25 April, Mr. Hata is 
currently completing a European tour that already took him to 
Rome and will take him next to Germany and Belgium, where he 
will meet with Jacques Delors on Friday.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu </F>
Hata by Jacques Jacquet-Francillon in Paris on 5 May: "Japan 
Wants Global Partnership With European Union" -- first paragraph 
is LE FIGARO introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Tsutomu Hata, the new Japanese prime minister, 
is touring Europe. After Rome, he made a stopover in Paris and 
then Bonn. He will be in Brussels today. This shows the 
importance of this visit which is aimed at preparing for the G-7 
summit due to be held in Naples 8-10 July. Mr. Hata wants to 
defend Tokyo's diplomatic position in discussing the trade 
disputes which Japan has with the European Union [EU] and the 
United States. In Paris, he had lunch on Wednesday [4 May] with 
President Mitterrand and he had talks with Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. He also met 
with Jacques Chirac. During his brief visit, Mr. Hata granted 
an exclusive interview to LE FIGARO. [passage omitted] 
  [Jacquet-Francillon] Your first official overseas visit as 
the head of the Japanese Government is to Europe. Why this 
interest? 
  [Hata] In January of this year, my predecessor as prime 
minister was due to visit Europe. But, because of his 
parliamentary obligations, he was not able to carry out that 
visit at the time which had been stipulated. 
  But allow me also to tell you this, from a personal 
viewpoint: Around 17 years ago, we set up a parliamentary 
association of friendship between Japan and the European 
Community. As general secretary of this parliamentary league, I 
did my best to ensure that we got to know each other better. I 
now chair that parliamentary association. 
  I would like to give you one of the many examples which show 
the results of our activities to promote friendship between 
Japan and the EU. This example is the establishment of a 
Japanese high school in Alsace, just near Colmar. I personally 
sought the location for that educational establishment. I 
personally had discussions with the inhabitants of the region, 
and we thus succeeded in founding that high school, which is 
called Seijo. I am a former pupil of the Japanese counterpart. 
With the establishment of a Japanese high school in Alsace, we 
also see many Japanese businesses becoming active in France: 
Sony, Seiko, Yamaha, and so forth. That is merely one example 
of the success of the activities of this parliamentary 
association. If I had not been involved in the activities of 
this association, that high school would not be there now. My 
own son studied there for two years. 
  But let us return to the subject of your question. 
  In the aftermath of the Cold War period, Japan thinks that 
it 
is necessary to have a global view of its foreign affairs. 
That is why we think it is necessary for ties between Japan and 
Europe to be strengthened, especially because Europe is a region 
which has very close relations with East Europe, Central Europe, 
Russia, Ukraine, the African countries as well as the Middle 
East and Far East countries. 
  We think that the strengthening of these ties with Europe 
is crucial for Japanese foreign policy. Of course, bilateral 
ties, discussions relating to bilateral problems, are very 
important, but the aim of my visit to Europe is not limited to 
that. We must also discuss global and international problems to 
try to find out to what extent the sphere of cooperation can be 
expanded. 
  And so, with a view to the Naples (G-7) summit, I wanted to 
have discussions with the leaders of the countries which will 
participate in that summit and establish personal relations with 
them. 
  [Jacquet-Francillon] In particular, what is your assessment 
of the talks you have just had in Paris? 
  [Hata] I have had a meeting with President Mitterrand, with 
Prime Minister Balladur, and with Foreign Minister Juppe with 
whom I had already met in Tokyo. I have also had talks with 
Foreign Trade Minister Longuet. 
  We discussed bilateral problems of course, but what I regard 
as very important is that we took time to discuss problems 
relating to world peace, the need for cooperation to promote the 
development of various regions of the world, including ties 
relating to cultural activities. 
  [Jacquet-Francillon] The United States, probably even more 
than the EU, criticizes Japan for an attitude which is described 
as protectionist, to put it mildly. Do you think you will 
shortly reach a trade agreement with Washington? 
  [Hata] The new government is determined to maintain good 
relations with the United States. There are economic ties, on 
the one hand, but there are also broader ties of friendship. We 
also have a security treaty with the United States. So, in many 
spheres, bilateral relations with the United States are very 
satisfactory. 
  But, it is true that, in the United States there is some 
anxiety regarding the nature of the Japanese market which it 
sees as closed. It is true that, to improve the quality of 
Japanese life, it is important to open the Japanese market more 
to imported foreign products and services whose quality must 
satisfy Japanese consumers. 
  Also, with the opening of the market, we would like to see 
more foreign capital invested in Japan. 
  We have taken a series of fiscal and monetary measures on 
several occasions to try to achieve this goal by stimulating 
internal demand. With regard to the the current Japanese 
surplus, our aim is to significantly reduce it in the medium 
term. 
  It is true that, with regard to sector-based negotiations 
with the United States, we are currently in a period of 
reflection. We are convinced that these negotiations are 
necessary and we would like to reopen them before the Naples 
summit. 
  Having said that, the doors are wide open for the resumption 
of the negotiations on both sides. We are attentive to any 
opportunity which arises to reopen these discussions. On 29 
March, we made a decision relating to the measures which should 
be taken to achieve that goal. And they include deregulation 
which must be specifically decided before the end of June. 
  I ask you to understand that any result from negotiations 
with the United States would not just concern products 
benefiting the United States. On the basis of the 
most-favored-nation principle, any result from our agreements 
with the United States would also favor third countries, 
including the EU member countries. 
  [Jacquet-Francillon] Here in Paris two years ago, in an 
exclusive interview granted to our newspaper, one of your very 
recent predecessors, Prime Minister Miyazawa, insisted on the 
fact that Japan henceforth intended to play a greater part in 
building the new world order. 
  Since then, it is true, Japan has played a considerable role 
in UN operations in Cambodia and everybody also knows that the 
UN secretary general's personal representative in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a Japanese citizen, Mr. Akashi. 
  Do you not think that, at a time when Japan is legitimately 
claiming a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, that it 
would be logical for Mr. Akashi to have a contingent of Japanese 
blue helmets at his side? 
  [Hata] It is true that Japan is trying to play an important 
role on the world stage with the aim of contributing to peace 
and world prosperity. A series of examples indicates this. 
This is true of the provisional administration in Cambodia. In 
that country, there are also members of the Japanese defense 
force, and civilians who have taken part in these UN activities. 
We have also organized a conference in Tokyo on the rebuilding 
of Cambodia. We have therefore been involved in the process of 
establishing stability and, at the same time, in rebuilding. 
  With regard to the former Yugoslavia, we have provided 
humanitarian aid through international organizations, like the 
UN High Commission for Refugees, and through the World Food 
Plan, in which our total contribution amounted to $97 million. 
  We are going to release a sum equivalent to $20 million for 
Albania. There is therefore a whole series of ways of in which 
Japan is being useful: the dispatch of human resources for 
rebuilding; the supply of necessary technology; participation in 
the peace process, and financial aid. We are convinced that, to 
be useful in maintaining and promoting peace, there is a series 
of measures which Japan can take, and that, by taking these 
measures, we can be useful. Japan is now undertaking these 
activities. 
  [Jacquet-Francillon] Is it conceivable that, once a peace 
agreement is achieved in Bosnia, members of the Japanese defense 
force will be sent to the area to verify the implementation of 
that agreement? 
  [Hata] Five conditions must be satisfied for peacekeeping 
operations. But whatever happens, once peace is established, 
people should be sent to verify the situation, to rebuild the 
region. That is something which can be done. 
  [Jacquet-Francillon] Is Japan prepared to side fully with 
its 
allies, particularly the United States, if there is a 
confrontation imposed by North Korea's plans to equip itself 
with nuclear weapons? 
  If it is a question of implementing an embargo on Korea 
tomorrow, in the framework of a UN Security Council resolution, 
would Japan be prepared to allow the United States unrestricted 
use of its military bases on Japanese territory? 
  Do you think that Japan could play a mediation role with 
China to persuade it to use its influence to keep North Korea on 
the path of moderation? 
  [Hata] The international community is currently trying to 
find, through dialogue, a negotiated solution to the problem 
presented by the suspicions hanging over the possible 
development of nuclear weapons in North Korea. Because the 
question of economic sanctions has not been discussed in the UN 
Security Council, you will allow me to make no comment on any 
practical arrangements Japan might make should the need arise. 
  However, from a general viewpoint, it is obvious that if the 
Security Council decided to take certain measures, our country 
would adopt a responsible attitude compatible with the terms of 
its Constitution. 
  In addition, because the PRC is currently the country which 
maintains the friendliest relations with North Korea, our 
government thinks that China's role in the solution of this 
problem is particularly important. 
  [Jacquet-Francillon] The economy of most of the developed 
countries seems to be on the road to recovery. Japan -- like 
France -- seems a little behind compared with its partners. How 
do you explain that? 
  Should Japan not contribute more to world economic recovery 
by developing domestic consumption, especially through fiscal 
measures? 
  [Hata] The Japanese economy is currently going through a 
process of adjustment, the essential cause of which lies in the 
cyclical development of the economy. It is also suffering the 
indirect consequence of what is known as the financial bubble. 
If you add to that the sudden increase in the value of the yen 
last year and the particularly cold temperatures in our country 
in summer 1993, you will see that our country suffered a series 
of unfavorable phenomena. 
  However, the upward trend of public and property investments 
is continuing to strengthen, and household consumption seems to 
be showing some signs of improvement too. All these factors 
allow us to think that the economic situation is, at least 
partly, on the road to recovery. 
  Our country's economy is starting to show signs of recovery, 
and the Japanese Government knows the extent to which it is 
important to help it to firmly take this course in fiscal 1994. 
  That is why a comprehensive program of economic measures, 
worth around 15,000 billion yen [Y] -- the central point of 
which is a reduction in income tax of Y6,000 billion -- was 
adopted last February, on top of many provisions already taken 
in the financial sphere. 
  In addition, a series of reforms aimed at improving economic 
relations with foreign countries was presented in March. The 
three essential points on which this plan is based are the 
strengthening of market mechanisms, the improvement of access to 
our internal market (secured, in particular, thanks to 
deregulation), and the establishment of economic management 
likely to boost domestic demand. 
  Moreover, we have the firm intention of making as much 
effort 
as possible to ensure that a fiscal reform, including a 
reduction in income tax, is produced in the course of this year. 
  With the implementation of a broad range of measures already 
announced, I think that our country's economy will be poised for 
a sustained recovery and thus make a greater contribution to the 
economic recovery of the whole international community.

  [Text] Paris (AA) -- French Defense Minister Francois 
Leotard has that "his country will be Turkey's lawyer in Europe 
for the latter's full membership in the European Union [EU]." 
  In a statement to AA [ANATOLIA], Leotard said that he left 
Turkey with very "warm feelings" after his official visit last 
year. He expressed the belief that France should grant 
preferential status to Turkey. He said: "Together, we must 
establish a policy of stability and peace in southern Europe and 
the Mediterranean which we share with Turkey." He added that 
the French Government wants to strengthen its ties with Turkey. 
  The French defense minister pointed out that Turkey should 
maintain its preferential status within the Western European 
Union. 
  Expressing his "feelings of friendship" toward the Turkish 
people and the Turkish Government, Leotard stressed the 
importance of the cultural and economic ties between the two 
countries. 
  Leotard stated: "Turkey can depend on France and French 
support regarding its full membership within the EU. In this 
regard, France will be Turkey's lawyer." He added: "We have 
shown the past that we can assume this role. We will continue 
to do so. This point was stressed during Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe's last visit to Turkey. The defense ministers will make 
similar contributions to this aim." 
  Leotard stressed that his country fully supports the 
struggle 
being waged against terrorism in Turkey, adding: "We believe 
that terrorism is a threat for all democracies. It is a threat 
for Turkey, for France, for Europe, and for the peoples of all 
democratic countries. We strongly condemn terrorism."

<F P=106> [Article by Dominique Garraud: "Mitterrand: `After Me, No </F>
More Nuclear Tests'"] 
  [Excerpts] Yesterday, the head of state reaffirmed his 
primacy regarding defense matters by issuing a statement 
opposing any resumption of nuclear tests. In his opinion, the 
next president of the Republic will have to maintain the 
moratorium, for "France will not want to offend the world." 
  Francois Mitterrand has an acute sense of provocation. 
Yesterday, in an unprecedented move, the head of state gathered 
in the banqueting hall of the Elysee [office of the president] 
200 people directly concerned with the nuclear deterrent, 
including army commanders, industrialists, scientists, members 
of Parliament, and ministers. With the exception of Jean-Pierre 
Chevenement, all his former defense ministers were there, as 
well as current Defense Minister Francois Leotard. However, 
there was no Edouard Balladur, who was elsewhere, for obscure 
reasons regarding scheduling difficulties. [passage omitted] 
  As the guardian of the Gaulliist doctrine of deterrence, 
Francois Mitterrand reaffirmed the pillars thereof: "The key 
aim of deterrence is to avoid war by safeguarding the integrity 
of national territory and ensuring the defense of our vital 
interests," he professed. As for the notion of the "final 
warning" which emerged in the sixties, it is a "terminal 
warning" which must not be led astray and become some kind of 
"nuclear artillery." 
  Looking at Francois Leotard, the head of state proved 
menacing on the subject of the government's majority. "Mr. 
Defense Minister, you intend to tell the National Assembly that 
it should provide itself with the means of response or attack 
against the weak or crazy. Should we use nuclear weapons 
outside our territory or apart from our vital interests? Must 
we rally to the adherents of the surgical, or even decapitating, 
nuclear strike? And why not a nuclear gun? To me that would 
seem to be a major heresy. There is no way I will accept it. 
And if an amendment in this sense came to be adopted, it would 
lead to a major conflict which the French people would have to 
decide on." Clearly, he was threatening to dissolve the 
Assembly. 
  The paradox is that this risk would appear to be 
infinitesmal. While Edouard Balladur remains very discreet on 
these issues, Francois Leotard will mark his opposition to any 
measure that would result in nuclear weapons becoming an 
everyday feature. And in the Assembly, the committed proponents 
of preventative nuclear strikes, led by RPR [Rally for the 
Republic] member Jacques Baumel, can be counted on the fingers 
of one hand. 
  By stating his views ceremoniously, Francois Mitterrand 
reiterated that nothing concerning the policy of nuclear 
deterrence can be done without him. In passing, he will 
certainly trigger several skirmishes within the government's 
majority against the excessive lenience supposedly shown by 
Edouard Balladur toward the president. 
  The provocative aspect of Francois Mitterrand's speech is 
not 
insignificant just before the parliamentary debate on defense 
issues. However, yesterday's exercise will go much further than 
the end of the upcoming parliamentary debate. "The movement 
calling for nuclear disarmament is healthy," said Francois 
Mitterrand, voicing his support for a renewal of the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and a "universal, verifiable" 
treaty banning tests. And that will not necessarily be the 
vision of the next president of the Republic, especially if his 
name is Jacques Chirac.

  [Text] After Alain Juppe's remarks this morning, Francois 
Leotard has said he thinks that nuclear tests should continue. 
The defense minister restated this before the finance committee 
of the National Assembly. He is thus in complete disagreement 
with Francois Mitterrand who yesterday afternoon reaffirmed his 
determination to maintain the moratorium on French nuclear 
testing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jacques Baumel, vice president of the </F>
National Assembly's Defense Committee, by Daniel Bernard; place 
and date not given: "Jacques Baumel: `The President's Speech 
Is Farewell to Arms'" -- first paragraph is LE QUOTIDIEN DE 
PARIS introduction] 
  [Text] Jacques Baumel, who is mayor and deputy for 
Rueil-Malmaison, is also vice president of the National 
Assembly's Defense Committee. In his opinion, "all Francois 
Mitterrand did [in yesterday's speech on nuclear deterrence] was 
harp on general principles." 
  [Bernard] Yesterday, Francois Mitterrand adoapted a very 
"Gaullist" tone. This is something you must be happy about. 
  [Baumel] Given the way things were orchestrated, as well as 
the setting and the audience chosen, and in view of the 
uncertain world situation and the unpredictable threats we are 
surrounded with, I would have expected the president of the 
Republic to give a clear definition of the new directions our 
national defense is to follow. What we got instead was the 
stubborn repetition of a number of principles first upheld by 
General de Gaulle in a very different context. All Francois 
Mitterrand did was harp on general principles in an attempt to 
show 12 twelve months before the end of his presidency, he 
remains in control. His statements about the continuation of 
the moratorium on nuclear testing is testimony to his 
determination to maintain the status quo. His speech was 
nothing more than a "farewell to arms." On the other hand, I 
can only be happy about Francois Mitterrand's newfound belief in 
the nuclear deterrent, which he opposed for 30 years! 
  [Bernard] What was it that you would have liked to hear? 
  [Baumel] After reaffirming those general principles which 
nowadays are taken for granted by everyone, Francois Mitterrand 
should have moved on to tomorrow's defense policy. In the 
current context, focusing on yesterday's world is inappropriate; 
what we must concentrate on is the disruption of former 
equilibriums throughout the world. 
  [Bernard] Which means? 
  [Baumel] I shall limit myself to three examples. First of 
all, while the traditional doctrine must be preserved, it was 
necessary to go beyond the old principle of deterrence, which 
was born of a bipolar balance of world power. Today, there are a 
multiplicity of threats against our country, including from 
Third-World countries beyond the Mediterranean. Such threats 
could one day be backed by chemical or nuclear weapons. 
  Second, the president said not a word about reform of the 
national service, about the choice between conscription and a 
professional army. Nothing was said about the indispensable 
professionalization of our military system, although it is a 
necessary step toward a professional army, that is, toward the 
army of the future. 
  Last, no decision was announced with respect to the major 
programs that were launched during the Cold War and whose 
weapons systems will be partly obsolete by the year 2005/2010. 
To an extent, this jeopardizes new programs.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- A second group of German citizens was 
evacuated from the Yemeni capital of Sanaa on Sunday [8 May] 
with the help of the Bundeswehr. According to the Defense 
Ministry in Bonn, an aircraft with 107 passengers on board 
landed in Djibouti, East Africa, in the afternoon, another 
aircraft also carrying 107 passengers is on its way. 
  A third flight that was originally announced for Sunday will 
presumably not take place before Monday. According to a Foreign 
Ministry spokesperson, 280 Germans who want to leave Yemen 
appeared at the German Embassy in Sanaa throughout the day. 
  Another special Lufthansa plane is expected in Frankfurt 
from 
Djibouti on Monday afternoon. It will have approximately 200

  [Text] Warsaw (DPA) -- Federal Economics Minister Guenter 
Rexrodt called upon the East and Central European countries on 7 
May to create clear investment conditions. "We need clear and 
reliable investment conditions for the whole investment period. 
Those who cannot guarantee this should not be surprised if no 
investment is made," he said in Warsaw at the East-West economic 
meeting of highly industrialized nations (G-7) with 10 Central 
and East European reform states (E-10). 
  Deviating from his prepared text, Rexrodt listed details: 
"In the energy sector, we will need such stability for a period 
of between 20 and 30 years. A calculable tax system is 
indispensable. Taxes must promote investment and should not 
burden investment unreasonably." Other points, according to 
Rexrodt, are a functioning banking system allowing the 
retransfer of capital invested, the acquisition of real estate, 
and the reduction of bureaucracy. In addition, exports must be 
possible, and intellectual property must be protected. 
  Rexrodt thereby referred to concrete complaints of business 
people doing business in the East. He said that last year, 
approximately 10 percent of German investment abroad went to 
Central and East Europe. By the end of 1993, the Federal 
Government assumed guarantees for investment totalling 2.9 
billion German marks. Four-fifths of this sum went to the 
Visegrad countries (Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, and 
Slovakia). The minister emphatically advocated greater access 
for the East European countries to Western markets. 
  To clarify practical problems, a business forum of economic 
experts having practical experience preceded the meeting. The 
participants published a "Warsaw Business Statement" on 6 May, 
in which they set the goal for themselves to carry out direct 
investment in the E-10 countries of approximately $200 billion 
by the year 2000.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Western European Union: Mostar </F>
Administration Set as Priority"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Luxembourg, May 9 -- The Netherlands, which 
takes over the rotating presidency of the Western European Union 
[WEU] in July, said here today that the solution to the problems 
of the martyred Bosnian city of Mostar will become a priority of 
the European defense group which, in seeking to resolve the city 
problems, will work closely with the European Union, which will 
be responsible for the city administration. 
  WEU foreign and defense ministers are currently holding a 
meeting here to discuss a new form of partnership with nations 
in Central and East Europe. 
  The European Union has already chosen former Bremen mayor 
Hans Koschnik to be its adminstrator in Mostar and has asked the 
WEU, the future defense arm of the European Union, to work to 
guarantee the presence in the city of an efficient police force. 
  In response to this, the WEU has already sent its own panel 
of experts and came up with a number of options for the European 
Union including that of training Muslim and Croat policemen and 
sending in an international police force. A decision on the 
matter is expected during the Dutch WEU presidency. 
  The discussions here between WEU defense and foreign 
ministers on the new partnerships will also see the 
participation of representatives from those nations slated for 
the WEU partnership agreements: Hungary, Poland, the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia -- the so-called Visegrad group -- 
Bulgaria and Romania, as well as the ex-Soviet Baltic states 
Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. 
  The partnership agreements grant recipients the status of 
"associated partners" with the WEU, the only European organ 
which deals with security matters and which is slated to become 
Europe's pillar in NATO as well as the future security and 
defense arm of the European Union. 
  WEU sources pointed out how the new partnership agreements 
expanded to the area of defense the association agreements which 
the WEU has already reached or is currently negotiating with 
these countries. 
  The WEU is currently composed of Belgium, France, Germany, 
Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Britain, the Netherlands and 
Greece. It is made up of all European Union members except 
Ireland, and all European Union members of NATO except Denmark.

<F P=106> [Article signed BB: "Talks on East Timor Have Resumed in </F>
Geneva"] 
  [Text] Geneva, 6 May (ATS) -- The fourth series of talks 
between Portugal and Indonesia on the future of East Timor 
started in Geneva this morning under UN auspices. UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is meeting Ali Alatas and Durao 
Barroso, the Indonesian and Portuguese foreign ministers, 
respectively. At meetings in New York last September, both 
countries pledged to take measures to ease the situation in that 
former Portuguese colony, which was annexed by Indonesia in 1975 
right after it became independent. The occupation of East Timor 
has never been recognized by the international community. 
Several organizations have blamed Indonesia for human rights 
abuses there.

<F P=106> [Interview with British Prime Minister John Major and French </F>
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, by Fabrice Rousselot; reprinted 
from the English language version of Paris LIBERATION; place and 
date not given: "The Downing Street Version: Balladur and 
Major"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister John Major and his French 
counterpart, Edouard Balladur, have played pivotal roles in the 
final stages of the political co-operation that made possible 
the Channel Tunnel link between Britain and France. Major and 
Balladur are both struggling to maintain popularity, control and 
respect at the head of right-wing parties. The success of the 
Channel link will be crucial for both. 
  [LIBERATION] What does the Channel Tunnel represent for your 
country? 
  [Major] It is a potent symbol of Britain's new role in 
Europe. We share with France an enormous pride in the 
achievement and skills of those who have designed and 
constructed one of the greatest engineering projects of the 
century. The tunnel links Great Britain with the Continent for 
the first time in many thousands of years. It will bring us 
nearer still to the French people, with whom our ties have grown 
ever closer over past years. 
  [Balladur] The Channel Tunnel will bring our two countries 
closer in many ways, not just economically. It will help 
strengthen economic cohesion within the European Union. France 
can expect to see an increase in tourism -- which is its primary 
source of foreign currency. 
  [LlBERATlON] What impact is the tunnel expected to have? 
  [Major] It will be a direct link to the single market for 
our companies who export goods, and for the millions who travel 
from Britain every year. 
  In linking Britain to the French rail system and beyond that 
to the wider European rail system, it will give our exporters 
the chance to benefit from long rail runs for the first time. 
It will also provide our business community with previously 
unparalleled access to important capitals such as Paris and 
Brussels. As for tourism, millions of Britons already travel to 
the Continent every year by ferry and air. The opening of the 
Channel Tunnel will provide healthy new competition. I hope, 
too, that it will encourage as many French tourists to visit 
Britain as British tourists visit France. 
  [LIBERATION] In France, the highspeed train link between 
Paris and Calais is already in place. Britain must wait another 
10 years. Why has it taken so long for the Conservative 
government to make a decision regarding the "British TGV [Train 
A' Grande Vitesse]"? 
  [Major] It was never intended that a new line would be built 
in Britain before the tunnel opened. The present rail lines 
through Kent have been improved to take tunnel traffic and will 
provide sufficient capacity until some time after the turn of 
the century. But, given that capacity is unlikely to be 
sufficient in the next 10 years or so, we are pressing ahead 
with our plans for a new line to be ready within that timeframe. 
We expect the line to reduce the London to Paris journey time 
by 20-25 minutes. There are a number of factors which make the 
British and French situations different. For example, French 
terrain is more suitable for railways than south-east England 
(being flatter), land values in Kent are higher than in northern 
France -- and in France there was existing local demand for a 
new rail link to serve the Lille area. 
  [LIBERATION] Great Britain is not as intensely committed to 
the scheme as France, particularly where the rail link is 
concerned. Is this a serious handicap? 
  [Balladur] It is not for me to judge the choices an 
important partner of France chooses to make. I will simply say 
that the high-speed TGV rail system in France has boosted the 
railway industry, as demonstrated by the success of our 
GEC-Alsthom [General Electric Company] in winning the South 
Korean railway contract. We intend to build on this; that is 
why the government has decided to build the Mediterranean (Lyon 
to Nice) and Eastern (Paris to Strasbourg) TGV lines. TGV gave 
the SNCF [French Railway Network] state railway new perspectives. 
  [LIBERATION] After centuries of fighting invasions as an 
island, do the British fear losing sovereignty and identity with 
such a tunnel? 
  [Major] Not at all. It is certainly true that the British 
have never been accustomed to the idea of getting into a train 
and arriving in another country. The sea crossing, however 
short, has represented a barrier. But countries such as France, 
which have always had land boundaries, are clearly sovereign and 
have distinct identities. Britain is no different in that 
respect. 
  [Balladur] The main feature of British civilisation has 
undoubtedly been its extraordinary expansion throughout the 
world. I cannot believe that the great British people, in order 
to protect their identity, would now be cowering on the very 
island from which they set sail to travel the world. 
  On the contrary, I am convinced that Britain has a major 
role 
in the building of Europe, not least in the originality of its 
contribution to the overall structure. 
  [LIBERATION] Britain has been accused by some of its 
European partners of trying to slow down enlargement of the 
Union. Does the tunnel mean Britain will be more "at the heart 
of Europe?" 
  [Major] In fact it was Britain that was the foremost 
advocate of enlargement and fought to have the states of the 
European Free Trade Association brought into the Union at the 
earliest date. In this we were successful. 
  [Balladur] Britain has made a remarkable contribution to 
the strengthening of Europe in a large number of areas, for 
example the setting up of the single market. The British 
Government and people have, like their French counterparts, a 
high opinion of their national destiny. But we all realise that 
our old nations, while preserving their identity and 
sovereignty, must co-operate more within the European framework. 
Closer cooperation between our two countries is of particular 
importance in ensuring that European opinions of the 
international scene are taken into account. In fact, the 
Yugoslav crisis shows that, at present, the involvement of other 
European countries depends largely on a move by our two 
countries which has brought our other European partners along 
with it. 
  [LIBERATION] What about the co-operation between France and 
Britain? Will it grow both on an economic and political level? 
  [Major] Our ties with France are already extremely close. 
We are partners in the European Union, NATO, the UN Security 
Council and the G7 group. We work together closely on foreign 
policy, defence and many other issues. We invest enormous 
amounts in each other's economies and many companies -- over 
2,000 at the last count -- are co-located in one way or another 
in both Britain and France. 
  Defence co-operation has been growing strongly in recent 
years. We have more defence projects with France than with any 
other partners. Our troops are used to working side by side on 
exercises and in UN peacekeeping operations. Together we have 
made the greatest troop contribution to peacekeeping in former 
Yugoslavia. 
  I am sure our links in these and many other areas will 
continue to grow. 
  [Balladur] Collaboration between France and Britain is close 
and productive. It also goes back a long way. Ninety years 
ago, our two countries formed the Entente Cordiale. The 
vitality of this agreement is founded on basic interests that we 
share, notably as nuclear powers and permanent members of the 
Security Council. 
  Today, our troops are once again working side by side in 
Bosnia. If the institutional debate has sometimes -- quite 
understandably -- uncovered differing sensibilities on the part 
of Britain and France, I am pleased to say that, when we are 
faced with a crisis, our two countries are essentially on the 
same side. That is why I have every confidence in the strength 
of our future political co-operation. 
  As far as our economic, scientific and industrial 
co-operation is concerned, this is particularly strong. Allow 
me to quote the most obvious examples. Concorde, Jaguar, the 
TGV trains.... Examples of successful Franco-British projects 
abound. 
  I am convinced that the cross-fertilisation of our 
economies, 
as symbolised by the Channel Tunnel, will be more marked in the 
years to come and I am delighted about this. 
  [LIBERATION] Could the Channel Tunnel be a commercial 
failure? 
  [Major] Eurotunnel has built and will operate the tunnel 
wholly as a private venture. In doing so they have backed their 
own judgment about future profitability. The new choices the 
tunnel offers both to the transport industry and the public will 
ensure both its full use and its success. 
  [Balladur] The Channel Tunnel represents a large undertaking 
which has broken new ground. One can never rule out the 
possibility of running into difficulties in the initial stages. 
However I am convinced that as soon as the French and British 
people -- not forgetting all the other Europeans -- understand 
the advantages of the tunnel, it will enjoy the success it 
deserves. 
  [LIBERATION] Will you use the Channel Tunnel yourself? 
  [Major] I am very much looking forward to being able to use 
the tunnel, both on business and privately. 
  [Balladur] Of course.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Commission Approves Pignone Sale to </F>
General Electric"] 
  [Text] Rome 6 May (ANSA) -- European Union antitrust 
authorities have given the green light to sell Nuovo Pignone to 
the American company General Electric, the European Commission 
announced today. 
  Under the approved plan, public sector energy group ENI 
[National Hydrocarbons Agency] will sell 69 percent of the 
Florence-based engineering company to GE, retaining 20 percent 
and making available an additional 11 percent of shares in a 
public tender offer that GE is expected to take up. 
  When the deal is concluded, GE will thus hold four-fifths of 
the capital, while ENI retains a fifth. Dresser and Ingersoll 
Rand, which had held 12 percent each in the privatization plan 
as originally outlined, and a group of banks holding another 20 
percent, have thus effectively been excluded from the deal as 
approved by EU anti-trust authorities. 
  GE's acquisition of Nuovo Pignone "raises no serious doubts" 
that the sale is compatible with the common market, the 
Commission said in its finding. 
  The new ownership scheme carries no monopolistic 
implications 
apart from the doubling of productive capacities in the sector 
of heavy duty gas turbines, which will give the new company 25 
percent of the market, the EU decided. 
  "A condition for the acceptance of GE's offer is that the 
company has promised to adhere to a business plan for 1994-97 
drawn up by them and approved by ENI," the Commission said. 
"During that period, ENI will negotiate certain rights in 
relation to actions taken to put into effect the business plan." 
  The details of the privatization scheme were first forwarded 
to the commission on February 24, but the EU asked for 
additional information in April before making its finding. 
  The deal brings as estimated 1.1 trillion lire into ENI's 
accounts, of which 700 billion lire as cash and 400 billion as 
debt transfers. 
  The main business consequence of the sale, the commission 
wrote, lies in license accords. Nuovo Pignone, which has been 
using GE technology to produce heavy duty gas turbines, will now 
find itself competing with other turbine makers using GE 
technology on license. 
  The question of what GE intends to do with Nuovo Pignone 
facilities has been a source of conflict with labor unions and 
local authorities since the deal to the American company was 
approved in December. 
  In January, in response to fears of a `foreign takeover', 
unions and Florence government officials obtained, via a 
syndication pact inside the new ownership, veto rights for ENI 
over the 4 year business plan. 
  Those fears were focused not so much on GE as on Dresser and 
Ingersoll Rand, with concerns they might shift the balance of 
ownership by selling their large share packages.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "White Paper </F>
Must Be `At the Centre of Discussions' at Corfu Summit -- 
Delors"] 
  [Excerpt] The European Commission is expecting the Corfu 
Summit of 24 and 25 June to be a frank and serious exercice 
under Article 1093 of the Maastricht Treaty, by which the EU 
Member States consider their economic policy as a question of 
common interest and coordinate these policies between them. The 
time has come to launch "true coordination of macroeconomic 
policies" which does not yet exist. This is what President 
Delors told Parliament in his statement on the forthcoming 
European Summit. He added that it will be necessary, in Corfu, 
to "keep the white paper at the centre of discussions and 
economic and social debates." Public opinion would not 
understand if the Summit did not adopt a concrete programme to 
be implemented immediately and financed by the major networks, 
said President Delors who said he hoped there would be an end to 
the "ridiculous polemic on the question of knowing whether the 
Community may or may not borrow, as if this was the first time 
it had borrowed." The group chaired by Mr. Christophersen must 
reach a conclusion, and there must be an annexed document in 
Corfu with a list of concrete projects, added Mr. Delors. He 
pointed out that the report of the other group set up in the 
context of the white paper, the Bangemann Group is "almost 
ready." Employment must remain the white paper's top priority, 
stressed Mr. Delors, and the Commission should propose new 
initiatives, not only in Corfu but also at the December summit 
meeting in Essen and after. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn/Salonika (DPA) -- The Federal Government is 
calling for a European harmonization of asylum laws. This is 
necessary in order to keep the negative effects of national 
measures on other member states as small as possible, Kurt 
Schelter, state secretary in the FRG Interior Ministry, stated 
at a two-day informal meeting of the interior ministers of the 
European Union [EU] in Salonika on Friday [6 May]. 
  In addition, it is, above all, necessary to develop a common 
attitude toward returning and integrating civil war refugees, 
the head of the German delegation said, according to a press 
release by the FRG Interior Ministry. The "priorities in this 
field were discussed in different ways at the conference," the 
press release adds. 
  The creation of instruments for a more fair sharing of the 
burden in coping with refugee problems is urgently necessary 
within the European Union. Germany is willing to make 
constructive contributions to coming to terms with the pressure 
of immigration. The indispensable precondition for that is that 
the member states must first set down the conditions for the 
acceptance of legal immigrants. 
  Stilianos Papathemelis, Greek minister of public order, 
stated that the external borders of the European Union must be 
better protected from illegal immigrants and stricter checks of 
refugees must be introduced in EU countries.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Commission </F>
Grants ECU10 Million in Aid To Help Create a Palestinian Police 
Force"] 
  [Text] The European Commission took the provisions required 
to make concrete the decision of principle (adopted by the 
General Affairs Council of 18/19 April in the framework of joint 
action under the CFSP [Common Foreign and Security Policy] "in 
supporting the peace process in the Middle East") of granting 
ECU10 million to assist in creating a Palestinian police force 
in the Occupied Territories. Mr. Marin informed Mr. 'Arafat 
this very Wednesday [4 May], in Cairo, of the Community 
decision. It is now up to the Palestinian authorities to submit 
operational projects that the Commission can finance (equipment, 
wages, means of transport, etc., but excluding the purchase of 
weapons). This measure is only one aspect of Community aid to 
the Occupied Territories. The ECU10 million are from the 1994 
budget, from a 50 million package for aid to these territories, 
33 million of which have already been committed for housing, 
schools, and technical assistance. For the 1994/98 period as a 
whole, the Union is committed to supplying ECU500 million for 
economic development in the Occupied Territories. The joint 
action under CFSP decided on 19 April contains several other 
initiatives alongside the emergency assistance for the police 
force.

Organises Emergency Response Exercise in Case of a Nuclear 
Catastrophe"] 
  [Text] The European Commission, the German Laender of 
Rheinland-Palatine and Baden-Wurttemberg, as well as the nuclear 
power plant of Karlsruhe (Germany) are organising from Thursday 
[5 May], near the nuclear power plant of Phillipsburg, an 
emergency response exercise, called EUROPA 94, to last until 
Saturday 7 May inclusive. The object of the exercise, in which 
representatives from EU [European Union] Member States, 
international organisations and experts from some Central and 
East European countries will take part, is to test the 
implementation of different emergency plans provided for in case 
of a nuclear catastrophe; it is also intended to encourage an 
exchange of views and experiences between those responsible for 
emergency services in the different countries, so as to 
guarantee a maximum amount of cooperation and communication in 
case of a real catastrophe. The European Commissioner 
responsible for European policy in matters of civil protection, 
Ioannis Paleokrassis, stressed the importance of such an 
exercise.

Million Francs Aid to Rwandan Refugees"] 
  [Text] Brussels/Kigali, 5 May (BELGA) -- The government 
decided to grant emergency aid of 100 million Belgian francs to 
Rwandan refugees in Tanzania, Burundi, and possibly in Rwanda 
itself, the Foreign Ministry announced in a communique on 
Thursday [5 May]. 
  Granted following a proposal by Foreign Minister Willy Claes 
and Erik Derycke, secretary of state for development 
cooperation, this aid will be distributed through 
nongovernmental organizations, principally the Red Cross and 
Doctors Without Borders, the communique states. 
  Mr. Claes also welcomes the decision by Ayala Lasso, UN high 
commissioner for human rights, to visit Rwanda shortly to look 
at how the United Nations could help safeguard human rights, the 
communique continues. 
  The high commissioner's proposal to devote a special session 
of the Human Rights Commission to human rights violations in 
Rwanda, which had also been suggested by Amnesty International, 
is supported by Belgium together with the decision to send 
permanent human rights observers to the region. 
  Finally, Belgium is examining with its European Union 
partners what concrete measures could be taken to aid Rwandan 
refugees and protect threatened persons in Rwanda.

<F P=106> [Interview with outgoing Interior Minister Ed van Thijn by </F>
Jan Hoedeman; place and date not given: "Ed van Thijn Predicts 
Heavy Weather"] 
  [Text] Ed Van Thijn, the outgoing PvdA [Labor Party] 
interior minister, is the ultimate specialist on how to form a 
governmen. He is the author of Dagboek van een 
onderhandelaar [Diary of a Negotiator] in which he 
describes how the Social Democrats won the 1977 elections but 
lost when it came to forming the government. In the informal 
hierarchy of the PvdA, Van Thijn (59) is the number two after 
Wim Kok. 
  [Hoedeman] Have you started a new diary? 
  [van Thijn] Since I have been back in The Hague I have 
started scribbling again. If this formation does not work out 
for the PvdA, I will have the time for a new book. But if it 
works out well, I will not have the time and I hope to be 
interior minister again. 
  [Hoedeman] What do you think the voter was trying to say 
with 
this dramatic result? 
  [van Thijn] The government has taken a beating because it 
meddled with the social security system without a basis of 
support. The three principal winners are the VVD [People's Party 
for Freedom and Democracy], the D66 [Democrats 66] and the 
elderly people's parties. It makes me think back to the 1960's. 
The parents of those days have now rebelled. 
  [Hoedeman] In the seventies you predicted the end of 
Christian Democracy. Were you right? 
  [van Thijn] No. Not if it takes 20 years to be proved right. 
Van Agt achieved a somewhat better result, and Lubbers achieved 
two good results after that. Perhaps in four years time we will 
be fully satisfied if the CDA [Christian Democrat Party] again 
becomes the biggest party. The fact that the CDA scored as well 
as it did is thanks above all to Lubbers who plunged into the 
campaign at the last moment. The CDA has in any event become a 
party just like any other, a party which has to win its seats 
through sound arguments. 
  [Hoedeman] In 1977, the PvdA won the elections but lost when 
it came to negotiating a government. The Pvda has now suffered 
an electoral defeat, how is it now going to score a success in 
forming a government? 
  [van Thijn] We must not be so arrogant as then. And with 
this defeat, there is certainly no reason to be. And there is 
no danger of that with Kok, who is anything but a tyrant. The 
PvdA and the D66 must stick together. No government is possible 
without the D66. 
  [Hoedeman] Wim Kok has lost the seventh election in a row. 
In the past, you discussed the matter of resignation with 
Vondeling and Den Uyl. Have you discussed the defeat with Kok? 
  [van Thijn] Not yet. But I know many socialists who reached 
great heights after a series of defeats. Willy Brandt suffered 
several. Mitterrand was defeated 10 times. There is no 
question of raising the matter of a leadership change with Wim 
Kok. 
  [Hoedeman] The voter has had enough of present government 
policy. Is it really in the interests of political credibility 
for the PvdA and the CDA to continue in government? 
  [van Thijn] It would be very strange if the present 
coalition 
emerged as winners from the formation process. It is likely 
that one of the two will leave government. 
  [Hoedeman] The CDA itself stated in its electoral campaign 
that there would be a "purple" coalition if the CDA vote was not 
high enough. 
  [van Thijn] Conducting an electoral campaign in this way 
brings a "purple" coalition of the PvdA, the VVD and the D66 
closer than ever. The CDA created an atmosphere in a way which 
left you totally cold. They have monopolized values and 
standards. 
  [Hoedeman] Will Wim Kok have to form the government and at 
the same time be prime minister? 
  [van Thijn] I expect first somebody charged with 
investigating whether a proposed government will succeed to 
consider all possibilities. There are three reasons why Kok 
must be prime minister. It is usual for the leader of the 
biggest party to be prime minister. The voters have expressed 
their confidence in Kok as prime minister. Also, Kok has more 
experience than any of the other four party leaders. Kok is the 
strongest candidate for the prime ministership. 
  [Hoedeman] How long before we have a new government? 
  [van Thijn] Not long. It is not going to be settled 
overnight, but it will not last longer than two months. Today's 
political leaders operate on a business-like basis, they are 
people who like to get things done. 
  [Hoedeman] Is there any place for Brinkman in a center-left 
government of the PvdA, the CDA and the D66? 
  [van Thijn] Brinkman's participation in a progressive 
majority government is not evident. 
  [Hoedeman] What coalition would you prefer to see? 
  [van Thijn] A coalition which is able to bring a large 
measure of political renewal to the government pact. Perhaps 
the D66 can exert pressure on the VVD in this respect. I would 
only find a coalition of the PvdA, the D66 and the VVD 
acceptable if it was able to reform the political system. 
  [Hoedeman] This result is certainly not a maximizing of the 
PvdA vote. What needs to be done? 
  [van Thijn] I believe we are on the right path. The polls 
gave us 22 seats, and we won 37. We are learning. We have made 
major changes in the party. Kok conducted an excellent campaign. 
  [Hoedeman] What name should be given to the new government? 
  [van Thijn] It must be the government of social decency. We 
have some heavy weather before us. Whatever coalition we have, 
some hard measures will have to taken. But there must be a 
basis of support for these measures. Kok has come out into the 
open, but he must not withdraw if he becomes prime minister. 
Kok must remain communicative. It has been demonstrated that 
you cannot announce stringent measures at a press conference. 
If we govern with the D66, we must adopt something of the new 
style of government. People have rights, they must not always 
be frightened out of their wits, we must engage them in 
discussion. We must be very careful in how we approach the 
social structure, but we cannot shrink back from the task.

<F P=106> [Andrew Grice and Michael Prescott report: "Tories Head for </F>
Third Place in June Election"] 
  [Text] John Major's prospects of surviving as prime 
minister suffered another setback last night following new 
evidence that the Conservatives face a crushing defeat in next 
month's European Parliament elections. 
  The most comprehensive survey of Thursday's [5 May] local 
elections for THE SUNDAY TIMES shows that if last week's voting 
pattern is repeated on June 9, the Tories will finish third 
behind Labour and the Liberal Democrats, losing more than half 
their Euro-MPs in Strasbourg. A computer analysis of 2.8 
million town hall votes in 100 constituencies shows the Tories 
would win only 12 of the 84 Euro-seats, a devastating loss of 20 
seats. The Lib Dems [Liberal Democrats] would be the big 
winners, capturing 14 Euro-seats, their first election victories 
in the European Parliament. 
  Labour would remain Britain's biggest party in Strasbourg, 
winning 56 Euro-seats, a gain of 10. 
  The analysis was carried out by Colin Rallings and Michael 
Thrasher, acknowledged authorities in electoral analysis, at the 
Local Government Chronicle elections centre at Plymouth 
University. 
  Senior Tory MPs admitted last night that it would increase 
the pressure on Major. They said the survey's most worrying 
finding was its projection that, on the basis of last week's 
votes, more than 200 Tory MPs would lose their seats in a 
general election, giving Labour a majority of 127. 
  There were signs yesterday, however, that Major will win a 
breathing space with a majority of MPs and local party chairmen 
rallying behind him. A survey of 75 backbenchers by THE SUNDAY 
TIMES since Thursday found that 60 MPs did not want him to stand 
down, only 14 did and there was one "don't know." Asked whether 
they believed Major would still be Tory leader at the next 
general election, 45 said "yes," 24 said "no" and there were six 
"don't knows." 
  A SUNDAY TIMES survey of 50 constituency chairmen found that 
44 did not want Major to stand down, three wanted him to resign 
and there were three "don't knows." Thirty-six chairmen 
believed Major would lead the party into the next general 
election, only three thought he would not and there were 11 
"don't knows." 
  In spite of this support and Major's determination to fight 
on, there were also reports yesterday of high-level Tory moves 
to oust him in the immediate aftermath of next month's elections. 
  Some ministers loyal to Major expect the Euro-results to be 
worse for the Tories than last week's rout. Ministers say fear 
of higher council tax bills being imposed by Labour councils 
persuaded many Tory supporters to stay in line last Thursday, a 
factor that will be missing on June 9. 
  Senior figures will hold informal talks this week on 
contingency plans to prevent open civil war breaking out in the 
party if the Euro-results are as bad as expected. Sending a 
powerful delegation to Major to ask him to stand down is among 
the moves being canvassed. 
  Close colleagues insisted last night that Major would send 
such a deputation away "with a flea in its ear" but one minister 
said: "Things could happen very quickly in June." 
  In another sign of crisis manoeuvring, it emerged that 
informal links have been established between groups of Tory 
backbenchers on the right and the left. Some MPs involved talk 
of building a consensus for a "new start" with Michael 
Heseltine, president of the board of trade, as prime minister 
and Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary and leading 
right-wing candidate for eventual leadership, as chancellor of 
the exchequer. 
  Major's supporters continue to insist the public will not 
accept a party which ditches its leader twice in less than four 
years. "If we do that," a senior Tory said, "we will be turned 
out and there will be a minority Labour government, followed by 
a deal with the Liberal Democrats giving them electoral reform 
and, in my view, never a Tory government again." 
  Former cabinet heavyweights on the Tory right rallied to 
Major yesterday. Lord Tebbit, the former Tory chairman, said it 
was "no time for a leadership election." Sources close to 
Baroness Thatcher said she, too, was preparing to intervene on 
Major's behalf after the Euro-elections. 
  Tory divisions over Europe resurfaced yesterday when Sir 
Edward Heath, the former prime minister, criticised Portillo for 
speaking out against a single European currency. "Obviously 
what he said was out of keeping with the prime minister's 
policy," Heath said. If the Tories were to do well in the 
Euro-elections, the government needed to face up to its mistakes 
quickly, he said 
  If Major does fall, Heseltine remains the MPs' favourite to 
succeed him. He was chosen by 14 MPs in our survey, five opted 
for Portillo, two preferred Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and 
one wanted John Redwood, the Welsh secretary. 
  Even if Major survives the Euro-results, his allies admit a 
leadership contest in November looks inevitable. Major's 
critics claimed yesterday that about 60 Tory MPs are ready to 
request an election -- almost twice the 34 needed under the 
rules -- and some Major supporters concede his position would 
become untenable if between 80 and 100 MPs voted for a "stalking 
horse" challenger or else abstained. 
  Evidence of Major's unpopularity with the voters emerges in 
a 
poll for today's ON THE RECORD programme on BBC1. Gallup 
examined the views of 1,613 people who voted Tory in the last 
general election. 
  Of the 988 "lost Tories" who were not planning to vote 
Conservative last Thursday 58 percent wanted Major to resign, 34 
percent wanted him to stay and 8 percent expressed no view. Of 
the 625 who remained loyal to the party, 22 percent wanted Major 
to quit, 72 percent wanted him to stay and 6 percent expressed 
no view. 
  Sir John Nott, the former defence secretary, said last night 
the Tory party could do with a period in opposition. Writing in 
THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH, he said: "Politicians in opposition can 
renew their acquaintance with the real world. They have the 
time to stand back from events and seek out the real issues."
