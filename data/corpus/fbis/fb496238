<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi by </F>
unidentified reporter in Genoa on 10 May: "Enough of Politics" 
-- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Genoa -- It certainly cannot be said of Alfredo 
Biondi, the new justice minister, that he lacks political 
experience. Born 66 years ago in Pisa, but Genoese by adoption, 
Biondi has pursued two brilliant parallel careers as a criminal 
lawyer and as a politician. A member of the PLI [Italian 
Liberal Party], he has been party secretary, environment 
minister and then community policy minister, and deputy speaker 
of the Chamber of Deputies. At the last elections he left the 
Center Union for the Berlusconi wagon. An active member of the 
Defense Committee for many years, he was looking to obtain that 
ministry, but was obliged to cede it to Previti in order to get 
Berlusconi out of a tight corner. He finds himself, therefore, 
as justice minister. And he is very circumspect with the first 
exchange of remarks. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Minister Biondi, you have always been very 
much a man for guaranteeing constitutional rights. Will you 
reconfirm this position in your new role as well? 
  [Biondi] No doubt. If a magistrate does not respect the 
guarantees set by law, he will find me opposed to him. The 
guarantees must exist for everyone, in all conditions. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] You have always denounced so-called easy 
incarceration. 
  [Biondi] The provisions of the penal code are precise. The 
judge is responsible for his decisions in the area of 
incarceration. I hope that judges will act in good conscience 
and that those who control their actions -- civil rights groups, 
the various courts -- will do their duty. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] There are those who periodically denounce a 
certain mingling of the judiciary and politics. What do you 
think of this? 
  [Biondi] One of my main objectives will be to eliminate 
political interests as far as possible from the administration 
of justice. President Saragat [1964-71] used to say: "Where 
politics comes in, justice goes out of the window." We must do 
away with judges who speak too much about politics, and also 
with those who base their behavior on political requirements. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Some people will read these words as an 
attack on Prosecutor Borrelli. Are they intended as such? 
  [Biondi] No personal attacks, I do not like them. And then, 
I do not even know Borrelli. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Are you the also in favor of the separation 
of careers on the bench? 
  [Biondi] This is a very delicate problem. Be that as it may, 
the concept that legal careers should also be vocations seems to 
me evident. The court system dates back to 1941. The need to 
update certain rules seems to me equally evident.

  [Text] There were a few surprises and many confirmations in 
the new cabinet. Let us quickly run through the new members of 
Silvio Berlusconi's government. Mauro Lozzi reports: 
  [Lozzi] Among the 25 ministers sworn in this morning before 
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, there are six faces which are 
completely unknown to the public at large. 
  The new foreign trade minister is a technocrat and his name 
is Giorgio Bernini. Bernini, 66, is a commercial law professor 
at the University of Bologna. An expert in arbitration, he 
gained his seat in the Umbria region running on the Forza Italia 
ticket. 
  The man in charge of the Universities and Research Ministry 
is also from Forza Italia. His name is Stefano Podesta and he 
is 45. He is a professor at Bocconi University in Milan, where 
he teaches commercial economics. Until 30 April, he sat on the 
board of the Rizzoli Publishing Company. 
  Altero Matteoli will be in charge at the Environment 
Ministry. He is 53 and was a company director until he took 
charge of the Italian Social Movement's organizational sector. 
He has been a parliamentarian for a long time. 
  For the first time there is a woman in charge at the 
Agriculture Ministry. Her name is Adriana Poli-Bortone and she 
is an associated professor of Latin literature at the University 
of Lecce. She had already been elected on an Italian Social 
Movement ticket, and in past legislation has espoused the causes 
of pension rights, the education system, and women's issues. 
  Roberto Radice was elected on a Forza Italia ticket and will 
be in charge of the Public Works Ministry. He is a businessman 
and a member of the executive board of the National 
Confederation of Small Manufacturers [Confapi]. He is new to 
parliament. 
  Finally we have Antonio Guidi. He is 49, and a surgeon. 
Guidi will leave a trade union background to take charge of the 
Family Ministry. Guidi himself is handicapped, and while he was 
at the Italian General Confederation of Labor he was 
particularly concerned with the issue of employment for the 
disabled.

<F P=106> [Report by Sebastiano Messina: "The Great Chamberlain Who </F>
Is a Power Game Professional"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] Who, then, is Gianni 
Letta, the man whom [Prime Minister-designate] Berlusconi wants 
by his side at Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister]? 
The post of under secretary to the prime minister -- which was 
once filled by [former Prime Ministers] Giulio Andreotti and 
Giuliano Amato -- will very soon be occupied by the tireless 
navigator of the sea of Italian politics, the soloist of drawing 
room diplomacy, the Second Republic's great chamberlain. Nobody 
is better qualified to guide the inexperienced prime minister 
along the insidious paths of the former party empire. Letta 
knows all its inhabitants, and, for all of them, he had a word 
of praise, a compliment, a piece of flattery. 
  From Abruzzo, just turned 59 (precisely on the day when the 
new parliamentarians took up their duties), Gianni Letta started 
busying himself very early in life. If, at home, he was the 
second of lawyer Vincenzo Letta's eight children, at the 
Avezzano lycee he was top of the class. At 18, he decided to 
earn his own living and applied for a job at the Torlonia sugar 
mills. He was hired as a laborer. The following year he had 
joined the administrative staff. Two years later he was 
promoted to manager in the chemistry department. 
  However, Letta was more interested in newspapers than in 
sugar. He started sending articles to IL TEMPO in Rome, and was 
immediately noticed. They gave him a post in Aquila, then in 
the Rome office, and his rise continued . A career like many 
others -- until Renato Angiolillo appointed him editorial 
secretary. This was a key position: In fact, young Letta 
became the mouthpiece of the newspaper's founder-director-chief 
editor. As Angiolillo grew older, the young man rose higher: 
executive officer, managing director, and finally director. 
  Once at the top, he looked around and developed a passion 
for 
electronic media: television. There was not a single debate of 
which he was not a protagonist, not a single round table which 
could start without him. Letta quietly disseminated his 
moderate common sense. Only once did he lose his temper, on 
[Fininvest talk-show host] Costanzo's show. During a debate on 
heart transplants, he and professor Azzolina exchanged some 
scathing remarks (a long survey on heart transplant followed in 
several issues of IL TEMPO). 
  When he was not appearing on TV, Letta spent his evenings in 
Maria Angiolillo's (the wife of IL TEMPO's founder) living room, 
where the capital's most powerful men -- including Andreotti, 
Rumor, Bisaglia, and Fanfani -- have met for the past 30 years. 
Yet, late at night, Letta never failed to visit the editorial 
office: Not a single item was published without his approval. 
  Legal problems also arose at one point: Cornered into a 
tight spot, Ettore Bernabei told the judges that he had handed 
over 1.5 billion lire in CCT's [treasury credit certificates], 
which had been taken from the IRI's [Institute for Industrial 
Reconstruction] hidden funds. Letta shrugged his shoulders: 
"The IRI was funding a promotional campaign. How could we know 
the money was dirty?" However, the newspaper was beginning to 
misfire, and its director decided the moment had come to quit. 
However, his holiday did not last for long. Three months later 
Silvio Berlusconi appointed him as his ambassador to the 
political elite in Rome. They had a clear-cut agreement: 
Berlusconi had only one friend, called Bettino [Craxi]; Letta 
had to take care of the others. 
  He did very well at his job. He was the discreet manager of 
the Fininvest counteroffensive over the Mammi law [on 
broadcasting], suffering, over each of Veltroni's amendments 
which was passed. Then, when Berlusconi tried to turn the 
Mondadori publishing house into an empire, Letta acted as an 
ambassador with LA REPUBBLICA's besieged staff. It was at his 
home that Berlusconi and Scalfari first met, on the evening when 
LA REPUBBLICA's chief editor told Berlusconi: "Let us address 
each other informally. Otherwise I cannot discuss an 
agreement." This was one of the few battles that Berlusconi did 
not manage to win. 
  Within Fininvest he behaved with skillful tact. He did not 
ask for anything for himself, he did not ever show himself in 
the editorial offices, he only appeared in the studios for his 
own show ("Italy Asks"), until the Rome public prosecutor 
requested his arrest over the frequency scandal. The Court of 
Cassation blocked the arrest, but Letta himself decided to 
suspend his broadcasts. He remained behind the scenes also 
during Berlusconi's drive to enter the political scene (which 
Letta had advised him against doing), although he acted as a 
"guarantor" for Fininvest's polling information. Few were aware 
of this, apart from Giuliano Ferrara, who saw his last-minute 
appeal to vote for Berlusconi censored. 
  Last famous words: "I like to watch and judge politics, 
rather than experience them from within." As from next week, 
you will find him at Palazzo Chigi.

<F P=106> [Report by Riccardo Luna: "Objective: Popular Party and </F>
Life Senators"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "The first thing to do to win the Senate's 
approval is not to go before the Senate. That is, not to go 
before the Senate until we have obtained a vote of confidence 
from the lower house." This was said by Giulio Maceratini, 
leader of the National Alliance's [AN] 48-strong caucus in the 
Senate. Who said right-wingers are conservative? In order to 
create the new government they are even willing to abandon the 
tradition whereby prime ministers-designate present their 
executives in alternation to both houses of parliament. 
  This time it is supposed to be the Senate's turn. On paper, 
the majority lacks sufficient seats in the Senate to govern. 
And so? "So traditions are made to be broken," Maceratini said. 
Together with Forza Italia's group leader, attorney Cesare 
Previti, Maceratini was one of the architects of Carlo 
Scognamiglio's election to the speakership of the Senate. 
  "In any case," Maceratini concluded, "I do not consider this 
custom of alternation so important." So "allies permitting, and 
with the agreement of the parliamentary speakers, Mr. Berlusconi 
will approach the lower house first and will address us Senators 
only after he has obtained the expected approval of the 
deputies." 
  Will the impetus of the lower house vote be enough to secure 
the approval of the Senate, too? Operation Senators started 
after Berlusconi's announcement ("I will address parliament 
Thursday [12 May]"): The majority is three votes short of a 
majority. The Freedom Alliance has 156 elected senators out of 
315. "But there are also 11 life senators," Massimo Palombi, 
elected in Rome for the Christian Democratic Center, said. 
"Last time, in the vote on Scognamiglio, they all voted in 
favor, apart from Giovanni Leone, who voted for Spadolini, but 
that was only out of personal friendship. Now, however, the 
establishment of the government is at stake, and it will be 
different." 
  Which life senators might grant Berlusconi their support? 
Gianni Agnelli, for one: He has already made it known that, if 
absolutely necessary, he will not withhold his vote. And the 
same goes for former President Francesco Cossiga, whose 
sympathies for Berlusconi and [AN leader] Fini are well known. 
  But Forza Italia is hoping that Giulio Andreotti and 
Amintore 
Fanfani, physical ailments notwithstanding, will also attend the 
Senate in its hour of need. Then there is Emilio Taviani, and 
many people remember that Silvio Berlusconi's first official 
move as prime minister-designate was in fact a courtesy visit to 
the octogenarian senator. Did he persuade him to grant him his 
vote of confidence? 
  It goes without saying that a majority established on this 
basis is anything but a solid one. This is why Forza Italia's 
strategists are gazing longingly at the senators. They 
certainly will not receive the votes of the independents, who 
will make Berlusconi pay for the presence of AN ministers in key 
posts. Nor that of the Pact's Pietro Berlingeri, whom his party 
colleagues describe as "a person of integrity, who certainly 
will not sell out." 
  That leaves the 30 senators of the Italian Popular Party 
[PPI]. "It is there that the possibilities exist," Maceratini 
smiled smugly, hinting at the effectiveness of the 
behind-the-scenes work that has been going on over the past few 
days. In fact, the results are already apparent, and the 
Ligurian, Luigi Grillo, already heads what appears to be an 
outright PPI splinter group: six senators who are willing to 
vote for Berlusconi. 
  "I am no turncoat," Grillo said in self-defense in an 
interview with PANORAMA. "My decision is the result of strict 
reasoning. The old DC [Christian Democratic Party] committed 
every possible mistake. Now the PPI must avoid the last and 
most serious mistake -- that of putting itself in a corner by 
refusing to understand what has happened in the country." So 
Berlusconi will also receive votes from Grillo himself, from 
Aldo De Gaudenz from Trent, Tommaso Zanoletti from Piedmont, and 
another three as yet unnamed senators. What if that is still not 
enough? Then there is a solution put forward by PPI floor 
leader Mancino. "Nicola [Mancino]," Grillo said, "raised the 
idea at our meetings that if two or three votes are lacking, 
that same number of PPI senators could leave the chamber, thus 
permitting the majority to be achieved."

<F P=106> [Report by Henrik Qvortrup: "Ellemann-Jensen Sharpens Tone </F>
Toward Progress Party"] 
  [Text] The Liberal Party chairman totally rejects any idea 
of giving the Progress Party the slightest influence over a 
future nonsocialist government's foreign policy. He also called 
remarks by Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen "indecent." 
  The Progress Party will not have a scrap of influence on a 
future nonsocialist government's foreign, defense, and European 
policies. 
  On this point Liberal Party chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen is 
uncompromising. He completely rebuffs [Progress Party chairman] 
Pia Kjaersgaard who demanded in INFORMATION that the Progress 
Party be given concessions in these fields, if after an election 
there is a majority comprising the Liberal Party, the 
Conservative People's Party, and the Progress Party. 
  "I would like to make it crystal clear: They will have no 
influence on foreign, security, defense, and European policy. 
So there is no reason to waste any more time on this question," 
Uffe Ellemann-Jensen told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. The party 
chairman also stressed that under no circumstances can there be 
any suggestion of a Liberal Party-Conservative People's 
Party-Progress Party government. This is another possibility 
with which Pia Kjaersgaard has flirted. 
  "I would like to make it abundantly clear what the objective 
is here: We are hoping for a Liberal Party-Conservative 
People's Party-Progress Party majority. And on that base we 
will form a Liberal Party-Conservative People's Party 
government," Ellemann-Jensen said. 
  At the weekend Radical Liberal Foreign Minister Niels Helveg 
Petersen warned against a Liberal Party-Conservative People's 
Party government which does not in advance have a majority for 
its foreign policy. Helveg Petersen hinted that such a 
government should not count on the help of the Radical Liberals, 
for example. 
  Ellemann-Jensen called these remarks "indecent and 
tasteless." 
  "These are the best words, because his remarks create 
uncertainty about Danish foreign policy. And that is something 
that Helveg Petersen as foreign minister should steer well clear 
of." 
  Ellemann-Jensen admitted that the Radical Liberals' votes in 
the field of foreign policy could be needed by a possible future 
Liberal Party-Conservative People's Party government. 
  "It it really turns out that the Radical Liberals want to 
return to the footnote politics of the eighties they will find 
themselves facing an election. And we will see who wins it," 
Ellemann-Jensen said.

<F P=106> [Report by Henrik Qvortrup: "Progress Party Demands for a </F>
Nonsocialist Government"] 
  [Text] The Progress Party has put up the price of its 
support for a future Conservative People's Party-Liberal Party 
government: A number of its flagship issues in the field of 
domestic policy must be implemented. This comes after both the 
Liberal Party and the Conservative People's Party have refused 
to move on the demands they are making in the field of foreign 
policy. 
  The Progress Party has produced tougher new demands which 
are 
to be met if there is to be future cooperation among the 
Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party, and the Progress 
Party. They are to be the party's compensation, because even at 
this present early stage Liberal Party chairman Uffe 
Ellemann-Jensen is already rejecting any suggestion of moving 
even an inch toward the Progress Party in the field of foreign 
policy -- and this includes the sensitive question of the EU 
[European Union]. 
  In return for concessions on the EU question Progress Party 
leader Pia Kjaersgaard wants more influence in the field of 
domestic policy when the base for a nonsocialist government is 
agreed. 
  "We are not simply the people who will go to the queen and 
point to Ellemann-Jensen or Engell as the prime ministerial 
candidate. We are setting a price," Pia Kjaersgaard stressed. 
  She and Kim Behnke, the party's finance policy spokesman, 
have already planned in detail those areas in which the Progress 
Party requires payment before it will supply the necessary seats 
in support of a nonsocialist government: 
  -- The party wants the personal tax-free allowance increased 
from 30,000 to 60,000 kroner. 
  -- Large-scale privatizations, of the Danish Statistical 
Bureau and the State Vehicle Testing Service, for example. 
  -- Basic pensions must be increased. 
  -- And end to the right to family reunification and a 
reduction in the annual refugee quota. 
  Both Pia Kjaersgaard and Kim Behnke stressed that the party 
will consider itself to have a free hand if the Liberal Party 
and the Conservaitve People's Party do not agree to its demands. 
  Liberal Party chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen commented that 
it 
is too early "to negotiate the details:" "But it is obvious 
that they must have some influence."

<F P=106> [Guest commentary by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland: </F>
"Europe's Common Destiny"] 
  [Text] "When the constitutional court in Germany 
reviewed the Maastricht treaty, it stressed that the European 
Union (EU) is the member nations' tool for solving problems they 
cannot handle alone. I have yet to hear a leading EU politician 
say that the EU should develop into a state formation similar to 
the United States. That will simply not happen and this is not 
strange when we look at the history of Europe," Prime Minister 
Gro Harlem Brundtland writes. 
  Where does Norway belong in a changing Europe? That is the 
question many people will be preoccupied with this year. 
Starting in 1995 the EU could include almost all of West Europe 
and over 95 percent of the Nordic population. The membership 
applications of Hungary and Poland open the possibility of an 
expansion to the east. At the end of the century we could see an 
EU made up of 20 countries. 
  Such an EU will be a diverse community. If the EU can 
contain 
outlying countries like Greece and Ireland, big countries like 
Germany and France, small countries like Denmark and Luxembourg, 
and new democracies like Hungary and Poland, it can also contain 
Norway, Sweden, and Finland. 
  But do we need the EU, can't we just cooperate on a 
case-by-case basis? As I see it, the idea that each country can 
manage alone has never been as remote as it is today. That is 
because we are so strongly influenced by what other countries do 
-- and do not do. Europe's land borders do not bar capital, 
trade, technology, pollution, or crime. Our right to national 
self-government is not enough in itself to ensure our national 
future. We are linked with the countries around us in a common 
destiny, whether we like it or not. 
  Therefore Europe needs binding cooperation to resolve all 
the 
questions resulting from common interests and conflicts of 
interest. A hundred years ago opposing interests between nations 
could lead to war, if worst came to worst. Today nations can 
take care of special national and regional interests and at the 
same time resolve shared concerns in a peaceful and democratic 
way in the EU. What do the people who say they would like to see 
the EU disbanded envision as an alternative? Does it ensure 
peace if each country assumes sole responsibility for its own 
security? Will jobs be more secure if each country builds 
protective barriers around its own market? Will the environment 
be better if each country determines emission levels? We must 
consider the answers to such questions carefully. 
  Many people ask what role a country like Norway can play in 
the EU. To answer that we must first look at the nature of the 
cooperation. The EU consists of independent and sovereign states 
that want to solve certain problems as a group. They have chosen 
this cooperation voluntarily. This involves a supplementary 
democracy -- which gives us possibilities beyond those we can 
manage on our own. When the constitutional court in Germany 
reviewed the Maastricht treaty it stressed that the EU is the 
member nations' tool for solving problems they cannot handle 
alone. I have yet to hear a leading EU politician say that the 
EU should develop into a state formation similar to the United 
States. That will simply not happen, and this is not strange 
when we look at the history of Europe. Can anyone imagine that 
countries like France, Belgium, Denmark, or Spain would give up 
their independence? 
  Every six months the EU countries take turns leading the 
cooperation. In this way Luxembourg and Germany have an equal 
opportunity to influence the agenda at the outset. In an EU with 
16 members, a Nordic country will have the chairmanship every 
fourth six-month period on the average. If we have faith in what 
we stand for, membership will provide us with entirely new 
opportunities for impressing our values on the European 
cooperation. When decisions are made, states with smaller 
populations have greater influence than the population figures 
might indicate. Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark with their 
25 million inhabitants would have a bigger combined voting 
weight in the Council of Ministers (13 votes) than Germany with 
its 80 million inhabitants (10 votes). 
  Some people advise against joint policy when it comes to 
such 
things as the economy, currency, foreign policy, and security 
policy. I have a different view: It is a big step forward that 
the European countries can talk about joint policy in these 
areas. It would be a poor alternative if they each went their 
own way. That does not serve peace, jobs, or the environment. 
  Why does Norway have an interest in an economic and monetary 
union that will eventually lead to a common currency? Primarily 
because we, perhaps more than others, need stability in the 
market that buys 90 percent of our exports. We saw this when the 
value of the Finnish markka and the Swedish krona fell sharply 
in 1992. That had a direct effect on Norwegian jobs. We were 
adversely affected by the instability. 
  A common currency means that we know what a krona, a mark, 
and a franc are worth, both now and several months from now. 
Until 1971 we had a common currency in practice as long as each 
country's monetary unit had a fixed exchange rate in relation to 
the U.S. dollar. This stability was a prerequisite for the 
period of growth we experienced then. 
  To achieve the goal of balanced economic development and a 
high employment level the countries must aim at low inflation 
and limits on budget deficits and national debts. These are 
goals we are very familiar with in Norway. They have been 
important basic elements in the policy the government has 
pursued in recent years, with support from the Christian 
People's Party (KrF) and the Center Party. We have strengthened 
Norway's economy and done well in the fight against 
unemployment. We can continue to pursue this policy in the EU 
and at the same time contribute to a stronger coordination of 
initiatives and investments that will provide more jobs. 
  What then is involved in a joint policy in the area of 
foreign and security policy? The treaty says that the countries 
will gradually implement joint initiatives in the areas where 
they have common interests, such as arms reduction, the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and steps within the CSCE 
framework. But in order for such steps to be taken 
everyone must agree on the guidelines. 
  This means that a country cannot be forced to accept a 
policy 
it basically disagrees with. But at the same time we should 
realize that in a cooperation in which everyone must agree it is 
often those who want the least who set the pace. In many areas, 
such as the environment, foreign aid, and peacekeeping actions, 
Norway is a proponent of stronger international cooperation and 
joint solutions. Here we would want a greater degree of binding 
cooperation. 
  Many people ask: What will happen in the future, do we have 
guarantees for how the EU will develop, and can we rely on the 
agreements we have entered into? No one can guarantee the 
future, either for Norway or for the EU countries. But we can 
reduce the uncertainty. In my opinion we can do this best by 
ensuring our participation and influence in the organization 
where the most important decisions are made. 
  When we enter into agreements we have a basic trust that the 
other party will respect them. Without such trust all 
cooperation is meaningless. We take it for granted that NATO 
membership gives us a security guarantee because we have 
confidence that the member countries stand by the agreement they 
have entered into. Eleven out of the 12 EU countries are our 
NATO allies. When we trust them in the NATO context, we must 
also be able to trust them in the EU context. Therefore our 
basic assumption is that the EU countries will respect the 
agreements they have entered into, whether they concern fishing 
administration in the north, subsidies for northern agriculture, 
or guaranteed Norwegian sovereignty over Norwegian energy 
resources. 
  Many have doubts about the EU. There are no definitive 
answers. But those who are in doubt must be aware that both a 
yes and a no vote will have consequences. Either way we stand at 
a crossroads. A no vote is not an affirmation that everything 
will stay the same. A new situation will arise if everyone else, 
including our Nordic neighbors, chooses cooperation while we 
remain outside. It will change our relations with the EU and our 
Nordic neighbors. Sweden and Finland will be linked more closely 
to European cooperation than Norway, and the boundary between 
Norway and the EU will be drawn along the Swedish border, the 
longest land border in Europe. 
  EU opponents call for answers to every conceivable and 
inconceivable future development. But we have not yet heard 
their alternative and their answer to how we will otherwise 
strengthen our ability to cooperate and take joint action when 
challenges make this necessary. As far as I can see it will not 
provide greater security to leave this responsibility to other 
nations and rely on them to speak on our behalf.

  [Text] A recent opinion poll in Norway shows that 46 
percent of the voters will say no in a referendum to Norway 
joining the EU [European Union], while only 32 percent will say 
yes. However, 55 percent of those surveyed think that Norway 
will eventually be a member by the year 2000. Norway, along 
with its Nordic neighbors Sweden and Finland, have completed 
negotiations with the EU and are scheduled to join in January 
1995, subject to referendums to be held later this year.

  [Text] The Norwegian Government wants to investigate the 
background of the fascist members of the newly appointed Italian 
Government before meetings are held between the two countries' 
ministers. Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal says 
cooperation will not be successful if direct links to 
Mussolini's supporter organizations are discovered in the past 
of the four ministers concerned. 
  [Johansen] Socialist Left Party Chairman Erik Solheim 
stressed in parliament today that fascism in Europe is not a 
common phenomenon but a criminal ideology and he wanted to know 
what attitude the government intends to take toward the four 
fascist ministers in the new Italian Government. Solheim asked 
whether the government intends to meet with the Italian 
ministers of culture, environmental protection, agriculture, and 
transport at ministerial level. 
  Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal announced that the 
Norwegian Government intends to assess the ministers concerned 
on the basis of the replies they have given. If they are 
fascists without any direct line to Mussolini, then they pose no 
problem. Should one of them belong to this gang, links will be 
out of the question, Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal 
stated sharply in a reply given in parliament today.

  [Text] Swedish radio news has learned that Sweden will not 
apply for a seat in the United Nations Security Council in 1995. 
It says Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas will address the 
Swedish parliament on Monday [16 May]. She is expected to say 
that Sweden will not have enough support from the other member 
countries because among other reasons it is going against 
Germany and Italy. Sweden applied earlier in 1992, but lost out 
to New Zealand.

  [Text] In a new effort to smooth the tension between Greece 
and Albania, yesterday Albanian President Sali Berisha proposed 
another Greek-Albanian meeting. 
  According to a report yesterday by Albanian Television, 
Berisha, who is visiting Bucharest, told reporters that the 
meeting in Zurich between foreign ministers Karolos Papoulias 
and Alfred Serreqi was successful because both sides showed they 
wanted to solve the crisis. He suggested another meeting be 
held in Tirana to continue the talks and resolve the problems. 
He said the meeting's aim will be to smooth bilateral relations. 
  The Albanian president did not say when this meeting would 
be 
held. It is significant that many people in Tirana wonder what 
happened to cause Berisha's sudden turn.

<F P=106> [Report by Ioannis Kanellakis from New York] </F>
  [Text] A new round of negotiations on Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] will begin in New York 
between mediator Cyrus Vance, Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, 
the Greek Foreign Ministry secretary general, and Skopjean 
[FYROM] Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski. 
  The new meetings and talks are expected to begin on Friday 
[13 May] or next Monday at Vance's office in Manhattan 
(Lexington Avenue), New York. 
  The Zakharakis-Vance meeting is being described as the 
continuation of the talks that began prior to the Greek prime 
minister's official visit to the United States. During that 
visit, Papandreou met UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
at UN Headquarters. 
  Commenting on the upcoming meetings on Skopje, diplomatic 
observers said the current climate is "more favorable" for the 
Greek side because U.S. President Bill Clinton's interest in a 
solution favors the Greek positions. 
  It is believed that in the new round of talks the two sides 
(Greece-Skopje) will "proceed with moves of goodwill and 
understanding" and should reach an agreement. 
  Reports from Skopje say that the Skopjean representative 
will 
show the "necessary willingness" so the talks do not lead 
(again) to a deadlock. This is the line that the Skopjean 
foreign minister has received from his government, which 
recently "received the U.S. messages."

  [Text] Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special 
coordinator on the Cyprus issue; Gustave Feissel, the UN 
secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus; 
and Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Tugay Ulucevic today met in 
Vienna to discuss the situation after the deadlock in the talks 
on the confidence-building measures. The latest effort is 
taking place just a few days before the UN secretary general 
submits his report to the Security Council. 
  The negotiations will continue tomorrow. Two representatives 
of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas are also participating in 
the meeting. It is felt that there is no chance for the talks 
to succeed because the Turkish side insists on maintaining its 
intransigent position. The Security Council is committed to 
studying alternate ways of promoting the Cyprus issue if it is 
ascertained that the UN secretary general's current effort has 
failed. 
  The Cypriot Government has said it does not expect anything 
from this meeting, because it does not believe that Turkish 
intransigence will bend. In Athens, the Greek Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said the meeting shows that the international 
community recognizes the need for making efforts toward the 
Turkish side. The spokesman stressed that the Greek Government 
hopes the UN secretary general's report will condemn Turkish 
intransigence.

  [Text] Returning tonight from his visit to Barbados, 
Canada, and Strasbourg, Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis 
said the Greek Cypriot side expects the UN secretary general to 
circulate his report on the Cyprus issue, which will tell the 
truth about what has happened and the positions of the two sides 
in the upcoming talks on the confidence-building measures. 
  Mikhailidhis said any further delay in the circulation of 
the 
report endangers the credibility of the procedure. He noted 
that our side has no objection if others want to continue 
persuading the Turkish side to accept the UN document of 21 
March. The foreign minister added: Our side, however, objects 
to interventions in the circulation of the report and actions 
that will question the image and the credibility of the 
procedure. The confidence-building measures issue acted as a 
catalyst to show foreigners that Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot 
side have no political will for any solution. 
  Mikhailidhis stressed that Cyprus' closeness to Europe will 
continue despite threats by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, 
who is obviously concerned that Cyprus' course toward Europe 
will proceed. 
  The foreign minister said that by abandoning the 
confidence-building measures to discuss the substance of the 
Cyprus issue, we are essentially opening the door for Denktas to 
escape from the difficult position he is in. He added that if 
the UN secretary general's efforts fail, we will ask the 
Security Council to adopt alternative ways to implement the 
resolutions on Cyprus.

led by House President Alexis Galanos returned to Cyprus late 
last night from an official visit to Israel. Galanos described 
the visit as positive, and added that Cyprus' relations with 
Israel have strengthened. He noted, however, that Israel 
considers Turkey to be a good friend and ally with which it also 
maintains good relations. 
  Galanos said: The delegation established that the Israeli 
side is not well informed about the Cyprus issue, and that there 
is almost a complete lack of awareness on many levels. He 
added: This is because there was no Cyprus Embassy in Israel for 
many years.

  [Text] Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas now says that a 
federal solution in Cyprus is not possible because of the 
difference in views between the Greek Cypriots and Turkish 
Cypriots. Denktas, who is on a private visit to Turkey, called 
on the Turkish National Assembly to declare the union between 
the occupied areas [northern Cyprus] and Turkey on the same day 
the announcement is made that Cyprus has joined the European 
Union. Denktas asked the Turkish leadership not to confine 
itself to the military occupation, but to support the 
pseudostate financially. With financial support, he said, the 
pseudostate could become a showcase for Turkey, which will rid 
it of the image of an occupation force. 
  Alternate government spokesman Spiros Arotis stressed 
Denktas' inconsistency and recalled that the high level 
agreements [of 1977 and 1979] providing for a federal solution 
in Cyprus bear his signature. The spokesman said Denktas has 
proven in practice that what he seeks and hopes for eventually 
is the recognition of his pseudostate.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Suleyman Demirel by Tamar </F>
Chikovani in Ankara; date not given: "We Are Not Friends But 
Brothers"--first paragrais DRONI introduction] 
  [Text] "We are not friends but brothers." This is what 
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said at a meeting with 
Georgian journalists in Ankara. Five times prime minister and 
now president, Demirel has a great standing both in Turkey and 
among foreign political circles. In spite of his busy schedule, 
he nevertheless found time to speak to us as he believes that 
Turkish-Georgian relations have a great future. 
  [Chikovani] Mr. President, what are the prospects for 
Turkish-Georgian relations? What could we have achieved in the 
past and what can be achieved today? 
  [Demirel] First of all, I would like to repeat that the main 
principle underlying our foreign policy is the establishment of 
friendly and business-like relations with all our neighboring 
states on the basis of international norms. In this respect, we 
attach great importance to the development of all manner of 
relations with Georgia. So, I would like to emphasize that 
Turkey recognizes Georgian sovereignty and territorial 
integrity. We hope that we will see the development of economic 
and human resources in conditions of peace and democracy. 
  The Abkhazian conflict gives us cause for great alarm. We 
believe the problem will be resolved within the framework of the 
UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act so that peace can be 
established in your homeland that has been ravaged by war. At 
the same time, the peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian conflict 
in ethnically diverse Georgia will be a good example for the 
other Caucasian countries. 
  I am glad that Georgia has taken important steps toward 
democracy and the process of integration with the world. I will 
remind you that Turkey, within the limits of its own 
possibilities, has rendered all manner of assistance to Georgia 
during what has been a difficult period for it. I will give you 
some precise figures. We have dispatched humanitarian aid to 
the value of $47,455,275, including wheat valued at $13,432,000. 
We have given credits worth $50,000,000 to the Exim Bank. We 
have unhesitatingly supplied our neighbor with electric power 
when considerable problems were created in this sphere in 
Georgia. This was precisely an expression of our good will 
toward Georgia during a difficult time. 
  We are continuing to support Georgia. I believe that an 
economically developed democratic Georgia will be a factor of 
stability in the Caucasian region. 
  Thus, we attach great importance to the development of 
economic relations with Georgia. The geographical proximity of 
our two countries will enable us to become natural trading 
partners. During President [as published] Shevardnadze's visit 
to Turkey, we signed many treaties in the political, economic, 
cultural, and technical spheres, which creates a legal basis for 
our relations. Several projects are already being elaborated in 
the fields of telecommunications, transport, trade, and tourism. 
The construction of a new border crossing will enhance our 
commercial relations still further. 
  It is a pleasure for me to have a close friendship with 
President Shevardnadze, who is a strong and an experienced 
statesman. I am convinced that, under his wise leadership, the 
Georgian population will realize all its wishes and aims. 
  [Chikovani] How do you assess the Turkish factor regarding 
the establishment of stability in the Caucasus? 
  [Demirel] In my view, there exist two fundamental 
preconditions for achieving peace and stability. First: 
Respect for internationally recognized norms, which are 
expressed in the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act. Second: 
The formation of a base for economic and social prosperity, 
which is possible through close commercial cooperation between 
the region's countries. I do not think that the second 
precondition will be disputed given that the world today is 
striving toward economic integration. 
  Turkey has recognized the independence of Georgia, 
Azerbaijan, and Armenia and expressed the desire to establish 
close relations with all three countries without any form of 
discrimination. This governing and rational principle clearly 
demonstrates the importance we attach to stability in the 
Caucasian region. 
  Turkey has always supported and defended the principles of 
territorial integrity and the protection of international 
borders by the use of force. Respect for these principles is 
the chief criterion for achieving stability in the Caucasus that 
is the homeland of diverse ethnic groups that have lived 
alongside one another for centuries. In many cases, we have 
seen that it is precisely the policy of the historical 
distribution of territories that has been the initial cause of 
instability. I deeply believe that territorial disputes should 
be settled only through negotiations and by taking into account 
human rights. 
  At the same time, we believe that, in the matter of 
establishing peace and stability in the region, the greatest 
importance is given to economic cooperation between countries in 
the region. We should establish close relations in all spheres 
on the basis of mutual interests and faith. I take this 
opportunity to express once more my belief that, by taking into 
account cooperation with the Russian Federation, the region's 
countries will be able to establish close relations. This 
belief was the main factor behind the economic cooperation 
initiative involving Black Sea countries. It is hoped that our 
relations will turn the Black Sea into a sea of friendship and 
growth. 
  [Chikovani] The problem of aggressive separatism is also 
familiar to Turkey. Do you think it is possible to resolve this 
problem in a peaceful way? 
  [Demirel] Turkey is indeed familiar with separatist 
actions that have been carried out by the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] terrorist organization since 1984. In accordance 
with a decision by the Turkish Government, this problem will be 
resolved in a lawful way. Whilst our security forces are 
fighting the terrorists, the government is conducting reforms to 
regulate the economic difficulties in southeastern Turkey. We 
are investing huge sums of money into this region. The 
southeastern Anatolian project, which is gradually being 
launched and which will be implemented on a large scale in a few 
years time, will radically bolster economic activities and 
create jobs. I am convinced that the great importance of the 
economy will split the terrorist group and the "silent majority" 
of citizens who are not raising their voice against the 
terrorists today. 
  [Chikovani] The world community is trying not to get 
actively 
involved in conflicts and often satisfies itself with just 
adopting resolutions or statements. In your view, what is the 
reason for this and to what extent is it justified? 
  [Demirel] Following the defeat of communist ideology, the 
process of the strengthening of pluralism, the supremacy of law, 
and respect for human rights got under way in the former Soviet 
republics. On the other hand, the world has certain doubts as 
they are threatened by radical nationalism and ethnic conflicts. 
As a European country that borders on the continent's hottest 
spots, Turkey has taken upon itself to contribute to the process 
of establishing peace and stability in the whole region. Today, 
Turkey is trying to accelerate the transformation of instability 
into a factor of cooperation and solidarity. Naturally, in 
order to achieve this aim, one of our priorities are relations 
with international organizations. We believe that such 
international organizations as the UN and the CSCE are searching 
for the right position in order to satisfy the demands of the 
current transitional period. Of course, the chances of such 
organizations being able to resolve these problems depend upon 
the willingness of their members to assume responsibility. 
  [Chikovani] A number of terrorist acts were committed during 
the preelection campaign in Turkey. To what extent is terrorism 
a characteristic feature of daily life in Turkey? 
  [Demirel] Terrorists are enemies of the state. The PKK 
insists that it is protecting the interests of the people yet, 
at the same time, it is slaughtering Turkish citizens, many of 
whom are Kurds. The PKK continued its bloody actions during the 
preelection campaign. As a democratic country, Turkey will not 
allow anyone to commit terrorist acts. By a decision of the 
government, our security forces are implementing the most severe 
measures against terrorism. 
  Terrorism is not a characteristic feature of Turkey today. 
It is confined to specific geographical regions -- southeastern 
Turkey -- and, as I have told you, we hope that we will wipe out 
the terrorists very shortly. 
  [Chikovani] When mentioning Turkey one thinks of the East. 
However, Turkey has chosen the Western path of development. Has 
this not led to a change of identity on the part of the people 
and to what extent has Turkey preserved its centuries-old 
traditions? 
  [Demirel] Proceeding from its geographical position, I would 
call Turkey the Eurasian focal point [posti] of the NATO 
countries. Therefore, we are both in Europe and Asia. Turkey's 
vast historical experience and cultural inheritance have 
contributed greatly to its occupying such a unique position. 
Turkey is an indivisible part of Europe as far as political, 
economic, and security issues are concerned. Furthermore, the 
fusion of Eastern and European values has taken place naturally 
in Turkey, which is further enriching Turkish life.

  [Excerpt] Ankara (AA)--[passage omitted] Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Ferhat Ataman replied to a question by an ANATOLIA 
correspondent at the end of a news conference in Ankara today. 
Ataman declared that Turkey welcomes the U.S. State Department's 
report on terrorism in 1993 from two aspects. 
  Ataman said that the fact that the separatist PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] organization was described as a terrorist 
organization in the report shows that the message Turkey wishes 
to convey to the world is being received, particularly in the 
United States. The spokesman noted that it is extremely 
important that world public opinion recognize the true nature of 
the separatist organization. 
  Secondly, Ataman remarked, the report identifies the 
separatist organization as the main reason for the increase in 
world terrorism last year. He added: "This is also a very 
important point." 
  Ataman stated that if certain other countries start sharing 
the same view regarding the separatist terrorist organization, 
this will constitute a very important development in the 
struggle against terrorism. 
  The section of the report concerning Turkey also listed 
Dev-Sol [Revolutionary Left] as a terrorist organization.

  [Excerpt] Ankara, May 11 (AA) -- The Foreign Ministry on 
Tuesday [10 May] said it had no information about a U.N. letter 
to the Security Council regarding the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline. 
  Ministry officials said that U.N. officials sent a letter to 
the Security Council on Monday expressing a U.N. commission's 
financial distress, but the letter did not mention Turkey or the 
pipeline. 
  U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said on Tuesday 
that he wanted to ask oil companies to trace sales of Iraqi 
crude so that the United Nations receives a 30 percent cut for 
its compensation fund for post-Gulf war expenses, according to a 
letter obtained Monday. 
  In response, the Security Council was expected to approve a 
letter Tuesday telling him to check with oil industry sources on 
any Iraqi crude impounded, sold, or used after the first 
sanctions resolution was adopted August 6, 1990. 
  Butrus-Ghali, in his letter sent last week, said reports 
from 
oil industry sources suggested that hundreds of millions of 
dollars of crude were involved after the sanctions went into 
effect without any payment into a U.N. escrow fund. [passage

  [Text] Ankara, May 11 (A.A.) -- Turkey on Wednesday [11 
May] expressed concern about the political crisis in Yemen and 
about the chance that it might take the shape of armed clashes. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman said at his weekly 
briefing that Turkey calls for the Yemeni leaders to stop the 
conflict in harmony with their people's hope for unity and 
peace, and wishes that further bloodshedding would stop for the 
good of the country. 
  `During this critical stage which is going on in the 
country, 
Turkey calls for moderation between the two sides and hopes for 
an agreement to be reached as soon as possible,' Ataman said.

  [Text] Ankara, May 11 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Ferhat Ataman on Wednesday [11 May] said that claims of security 
forces burning down villages and forcing the population in the 
southeast to emigrate to northern Iraq are all part of a 
previously written ploy aimed at fooling the world. 
  Speaking at his weekly briefing, Ataman strongly denied 
foreign press reports on so-called forced emigration of 3,500 to 
6,000 Turks of Kurdish origin following operations by security 
forces in the region and of villages being burned down. 
  "We knew the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorist 
organization would try to send some of our citizens voluntarily 
or by force to northern Iraq, group them together and present 
them to the foreign press as `Kurds escaping Turkish 
oppression,'" Ataman said adding that this action aimed at 
increasing the foreign pressure on Turkey. 
  "The organization has started to transport its sympathizers 
as well as others from the region to northern Iraq in small 
groups and are also aiming to obtain money from the United 
Nations for their own," he said. 
  "The terrorist organization is trying, as ever, to deceive 
the foreign public and stage a new play completely based on its 
own scenario," he said. "It is trying to obtain United Nations 
money through its own supporters in the process." 
  "There is no question of any village being purposefully 
bombarded or destroyed by security forces," he said. "Some of 
the villagers have been already moved to safe regions in order 
to escape PKK terror and there has been some damage in some 
hamlets or villages where the security forces have clashed with 
terrorists." 
  "In these cases, our innocent citizens, as always, are 
compensated by the state," he said.

<F P=106> [Article signed JPH: "Netherlands and Germany To Submit </F>
CSCE Proposal"] 
  [Text] The Hague, 10 May (ANP) -- Wim Kooijmans and Klaus 
Kinkel, the Netherlands and German foreign ministers, 
respectively, want the CSCE to bear greater responsibilities. 
Among other things, the CSCE should be prepared to undertake 
more peacekeeping operations, but in close cooperation with the 
United Nations. 
  That is the essence of the proposal Kooijmans and Kinkel 
will 
be making to next week's special CSCE meeting in Vienna. The 
ministers will personally present the proposal at a joint 
meeting of the CSCE Permanent Committee and the security forum. 
Ambassadors from the 52 member states (Serbia/Montenegro have 
been suspended) sit on these committees, which respectively 
discuss the political and military aspects of cooperation. It 
is quite exceptional for ministers to present their plans in 
person. 
  The Netherlands and Germany feel that the CSCE makes too 
little use of the opportunities available to it. At the 1992 
Helsinki summit, the member states decided that in the event of 
future conflicts the CSCE should be able to undertake missions 
to investigate the situation on the spot. Subject to strict 
conditions, the organization may also undertake peacekeeping 
operations, for which it can request the military resources of 
NATO and the Western European Union. 
  This makes the CSCE a "regional organization" according to 
the UN Charter. This means that it bears, in principle, initial 
responsibility for settling any conflict in the area covered by 
its treaty (Europe). The Hague and Bonn believe that it does 
not yet make enough use of this authority. Peacekeeping 
missions are now being planned for Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  The CSCE may not, however, undertake any peacemaking 
activities. If a conflict gets out of hand to the extent that 
such a mission is required, the United Nations must then take 
over. The proposal by Kooijmans and Kinkel states that, in such 
cases, the CSCE must hand over the mission as fully as possible 
"so that it contributes to subsequent UN action and that the 
United Nations does not have to start again from zero," 
according to a Netherlands Foreign Ministry spokesman. 
  The CSCE regularly brings together all the countries of 
Europe, including most of the former Soviet republics and the 
former Yugoslavia, plus Canada and the United States, to discuss 
such matters as political and military security, human rights, 
and the prevention of conflicts. 
  The proposal by Kooijmans and Kinkel is to be discussed at a 
subsequent CSCE conference to be held in Budapest in October and 
November at which developments in the organization will be on 
the agenda.

this, the UN secretary general envisages a 5,500-strong force. 
They would be authorized to defend themselves if they are

  [Excerpt] London, 11 May (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
stated that he and British Prime Minister John Major discussed a 
number of issues of common concern, notably the Middle East 
issue, the situation in Yemen, peace in the Middle East, and 
developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In a statement to reporters 
after his meeting with Major, he said he will be discussing 
these issues in detail during his meeting with Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd tomorrow. At the beginning of the meeting, Musa 
conveyed a verbal message from President Mubarak on developments 
in the Middle East and the peace process and received Major's 
reply. 
  Musa said that he and Major also discussed ways of 
strengthening cooperation between Egypt and Britain in various 
fields. He said he conveyed to Major Egypt's views on the 
situation in Bosnia and expressed his hope that the liaison 
committee on Bosnia will begin its work to end the Serb 
aggression. 
  Regarding the Lebanese issue, Musa said that the basis of a 
solution is UN Resolution 425 on a settlement between Lebanon 
and Israel. With regard to Yemen, he said Egypt has maintained 
contacts with both parties there, and noted that President 
Mubarak's envoy has visited Yemen several times and will return 
to complete President Mubarak's endeavors to end the crisis. He 
pointed out that Egypt will spare no efforts to resolve the 
current crisis in Yemen, noting that no party wanted things to 
reach this state of affairs. He emphasized that the events in 
Yemen are not in the interest of either party and that things 
should not have reached this point. 
  Discussing the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement, Musa said that 
the implementation is the responsibility of both parties, adding 
that Egypt is always ready to help. He noted that there are 
still obstacles and voiced his hope that things between the 
Palestinians and Israelis will go well. 
  Regarding the Syrian issues, Musa said that peace with Syria 
is the basis of a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, and 
noted the efforts of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
during his latest visit to Syria and Israel. He voiced his hope 
for progress in the talks between Syria and Israel, and stressed 
Egypt's readiness to cooperate and to help achieve a 
comprehensive peace in the region. It should be recalled that 
Musa arrived in London this morning on a three-day visit.

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to the Congress of </F>
Deputies in Madrid--live] 
  [Excerpts] Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen: Various 
parliamentary groups have asked me to appear before the House, 
in accordance with Article 203 of the regulations, to give the 
government's position on the situation created in Spanish 
society--I am reading this word for word--in view of the flight 
of [former Civil Guard Director General] Mr. Roldan and the many 
responsibilities that arise from this. Although this is the 
reason for my appearance--bearing in mind the social disquiet 
that has been caused and the political uncertainty experienced 
in the past few days--you will understand if I make, albeit 
briefly, a number of points of a more general nature. 
  First, the circumstances that can be explained with regard 
to 
the flight of Mr. Roldan were explained by former Interior 
Minister Asuncion in an appearance before the joint justice and 
interior committee held last week after the calling of this 
plenary session. The course of the investigation by a large team 
from the security forces is continuing both inside and outside 
our borders. We hope it will bear fruit as soon as possible. 
  For my part, ladies and gentlemen, to add any more details 
on 
this task would be imprudent because it could detract from the 
effectiveness of the work of the security forces. You know, 
however, ladies and gentlemen, that the prosecutor's office has 
applied for the freezing of Mr. Roldan's current accounts. This 
will not only facilitate the work of justice but will also limit 
his capacity for movement. 
  Second, knowledge of the government's position is called for 
with regard to the other responsibilities of all kinds that 
arise from his flight. In my view, these responsibilities could 
have a political, administrative, or penal nature. There seems 
to be no doubt that political responsibilities exist, although 
the juridical-constitutional limits of surveillance are also 
clear. Well, after the first report--the first, ladies and 
gentlemen--of the disappearance of Mr. Roldan, the interior 
minister presented his irrevocable resignation in less than 24 
hours. This is an assumption of political responsibility with 
regard to the specific fact of the flight itself. Bearing in 
mind the gravity of the matter overall and its great social 
repercussions, [former Interior Minister] Mr. Corcuera gave up 
his seat as a deputy in a gesture that, by its very nature, 
surely goes beyond the normal demands of such responsibilities. 
  In relation to his flight, there is no doubt that there 
could 
be other kinds of responsibilities in the administrative or 
penal areas. The ministry is investigating those that may have 
lain in its jurisdiction. If penal responsibilities derive from 
this investigation, the findings will be passed on to the 
judiciary so that they can be dealt with in accordance with the 
law. 
  However, I want to make it clear to you, ladies and 
gentlemen, that the main priority is to place Mr. Roldan at the 
disposal of the courts. The Ministry of Justice and the 
Ministry of Interior are directing their utmost efforts to this 
end. Consequently, it is necessary to recognize the serious 
public concern caused by his flight. One can and should be 
critical and demanding with regard to the circumstances that 
brought about his flight, but one should not be more specific at 
the present time in order to avoid prejudicing the work of the 
security forces. Responsibility can be demanded for a fault 
confirmed by the facts; this has already been fully assumed. 
  In my view, one should not speculate from positions of 
responsibility about hypothetical blackmail or impossible 
battles of wills in a law-governed state. As a government, 
still less can we accept any suggestion of connivance. For us, 
I repeat, more than for anyone, the main priority is to place 
Mr. Roldan at the disposal of the courts. The fulfillment of 
this intention will clearly demonstrate that there cannot be any 
kind of impunity. 
  I know that some groups have persistently asked, now and on 
previous occasions, for my resignation as prime minister. As I 
have already said to the House with regard to the positions 
taken--when they do not have clearly biased connotations and 
partisan or other interests--I believe that it is my obligation 
to remain at the head of the government, respecting the will of 
the ballot box, helping to clarify this and other matters, with 
the aim of seeing justice done and the necessary confidence 
reestablished in the institutions. 
  I said at the beginning of my address that I thought it was 
necessary to explain my government's attitude toward the 
disquiet caused in our society by this and other events of 
undoubted importance, even though they may not be the specific 
motive of the request for my appearance today. 
  We are witnessing the recovery of our economy, together with 
what this means for employment. This is without a doubt the 
greatest and the most constant concern of our society. As a 
government, we are duty bound to maintain political stability 
and to overcome the justified concern of society, not only 
because of the importance that this has in itself but also in 
order to establish the climate of confidence that aids the 
process of recovery. So, ladies and gentlemen, I feel myself 
doubly obliged to contribute through the action of the 
government to reestablishing this confidence in the functioning 
of the institutions, and I am firmly determined to do so. For 
this reason, I do not share the requests for my resignation, in 
the conviction that this would generate a climate of instability 
that would make this task more difficult. 
  Three weeks ago, during the state of the nation debate, we 
discussed in depth the problem created by the cases of 
corruption. We decided on government actions, parliamentary 
actions, and we also announced our readiness to accept those 
responsibilities corresponding to us. We considered it 
necessary to improve the instruments for anticipating, 
investigating, and judging irregular practices and corrupt 
conduct. 
  Since that time, Mr. Roldan's flight has, without a doubt, 
heightened the climate of social concern. At the same time, 
however, the government and parliament have acted by fulfilling 
the commitments emanating from that debate. In these three 
weeks, we have demonstrated with actions our capacity to adopt 
measures, measures that strengthen the chambers' control or 
which entail government initiatives and decisions. We have also 
demonstrated our readiness to assume political responsibilities 
by virtue of the desire to contribute to the lessening of 
society's disquiet or the desire not to prejudice a shared 
project. We are thereby contributing to the improvement of the 
situation, despite those incidents that may occur on the way. 
  Today one can see with the clarity provided by the facts 
that 
the fight against corruption is a priority of our political 
action. [passage omitted] 
  As I said at the beginning of my statement, a series of 
political responsibilities have to be assumed, and this is what 
has happened over the last few days. 
  I have already mentioned the decision by former Interior 
Minister Antoni Asuncion to tender his resignation, assuming his 
political responsibility for the flight of Mr. Roldan. I have 
also mentioned Mr. Corcuera, who has given up his seat in 
parliament--linking it to his former responsibility as interior 
minister. Mr. Carlos Solchaga, former head of the parliamentary 
group and socialist deputy, also tendered his resignation from 
both posts, linking them to the responsibility taken on when he 
was finance and economy minister. There was also the case of 
Mr. Rubio, the former governor of the Bank of Spain. 
  I have said before--and I repeat myself here--that, in my 
opinion, this taking of responsibility most surely goes beyond 
what can reasonably be expected. The generosity of those who 
assumed responsibility, however, is meant to contribute and to 
give a stronger answer to this situation and to reestablish the 
citizens' confidence in the institutions and in their political 
representatives. 
  Finally, the former agriculture minister [Vidente Albero] 
also assumed his political responsibility linked to tax issues, 
which he explained to the public after presenting his 
irrevocable resignation. 
  The recent events show clearly that there cannot be any kind 
of impunity in our democracy. In fact, there is none for 
irregular or illegal acts. Furthermore, they show our will as a 
political group to assume our responsibilities. 
  Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is urgent to finish 
this set of measures and to clarify fully the corruption 
situations in order to wipe out any kind of feeling of impunity 
that may have been felt and to thus clear up any uncertainties 
that might weaken the impulse and energy needed for ending the 
economic recession. This recovery means reestablishing 
confidence in the future. That can only happen in a calmer 
atmosphere than the one we have had over the last few days. 
  The best contribution we can all make to this climate of 
confidence would be for everyone to assume their responsibility 
and renounce political advantages made by hurting the whole of 
society. 
  It is our duty to avoid causing more social alarm, 
considering the circumstances we must face, and to help restore 
as soon as possible a climate of confidence in the institutions 
and in the real economic possibilities that exist in the future. 
  We cannot reach this without political stability. Following 
the 6 June elections, in order to guarantee this stability, one 
has to complete the majority that is governing in 
minority--which our party represents. This is what we are 
doing, correctly interpreting the will the citizens expressed in 
voting. In our democratic system, a respect for rules 
represents a guarantee for all. It does not help stability, and 
thereby does not help the confidence we need for economic 
recovery, if we try and discuss alternatives not chosen by the 
voters. 
  As prime minister, I agree to have a vote of no confidence 
as 
soon as I feel that it is necessary to determine the support, or 
lack of it, in this chamber. This has not happened until now. 
So it is our obligation as a government to continue making the 
necessary decisions to combat corruption cases and to 
reestablish a climate of confidence that will further the 
recovery of our economy. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the initiatives that make this double 
task more difficult will, sooner or later, be seen as negative 
by the society because they will diminish the needed political 
stability. Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Article by C.G.: "Kohl and Yeltsin Intend To Present </F>
German-Russian Normalcy"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 10 May -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin, 
accompanied by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Economics 
Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, 
is scheduled to arrive in Bonn this Wednesday [11 May]. In 
addition to the cultivation of German-Russian relations, the 
visit is intended to demonstrate Russia's importance within the 
network of European relations. The Federal Government also has 
an interest in strengthening Russia's self-confidence by 
including it in agreements and preventing the emergence of 
distrust that could turn into aggressiveness. Yeltsin will hold 
talks with President Richard von Weizsaecker and Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl; on 13 May, he will meet with business and industry 
representatives. Yeltsin will visit telecommunications and 
high-tech companies in Baden-Wuerttemberg. German industrialists 
would have preferred a round of talks to discuss their wish for 
a reduction of investment barriers in Russia. Yeltsin's schedule 
apparently did not allow such a program. 
  The German economic sector deplores discriminating tax laws 
and legal insecurity in Russia. Kohl's proposal that Western 
firms repair the leaks in Russian oil and gas pipelines could 
not be implemented, nor have the Russian nuclear power plants 
been made safe. The seven major industrial nations (G7) and the 
European Union (EU) programs to this end are making hardly any 
progress because Moscow insists that Russian nuclear power 
plants are safer than those in the West. During Yeltsin's 
visit, the Federal Republic will reportedly not make any new 
financial pledges, since the current scope for Hermes [credit 
insurance company] credits has not been fully exhausted. 
However, the Federal Government will confirm that it will 
continue to support the course of reform. The government 
believes that even though Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin is 
pursuing reform more slowly, "it is more important that the 
basic course be continued." Bonn does not doubt that the 
Chernomyrdin government is serious about carrying out reform. 
The Moscow chief of government had sent many foreign advisers 
home and asked Western governments to appoint more serious and 
more experienced experts. 
  This time, no "joint statement" will be signed in Bonn, no 
agreements will be concluded, and the course of the visit is to 
present normalcy. The aim of the visit has been defined in Bonn 
as "psychological." It has been noted increasingly in recent 
months that Russia has the impression that it is not being taken 
seriously as a great power and a nuclear power. As U.S. 
President Bill Clinton did in Moscow in January, Kohl will now 
stress to Yeltsin that Moscow is being treated as an equal 
partner, and Germany is supporting the integration of Russia 
into European institutions. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free 
Democratic Party -- FDP) will make clear to Andrey Kozyrev that 
"Russia belongs to us, and we want Russia to become integrated." 
  According to Kinkel, the fact should be considered that 
following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, Russia is feeling 
like a "solitary state" without any allies. 
  In the Bonn talks, Kohl, Kinkel, and Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) will advocate NATO's 
offer of "Partnership for Peace." According to the Chancellor's 
Office, Russia's role as a great power cannot be ignored in this 
respect. Regarding Moscow's statements that the "Partnership for 
Peace" should be replaced by a special relationship with NATO, 
as Russia has in mind, the Federal Government wants to find out 
"what and how Russia will sign." What type of special role 
Moscow has in mind has not been fully discussed. According to 
government officials, a separate relationship between Russia and 
the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany, which 
some Russian politicians are seeking, is out of the question and 
is at best useful only in certain situations. NATO as a whole 
and Moscow should define their mutual relationship, because 
otherwise, the smaller alliance and EU members would be 
offended. Germany considers the request that NATO consult 
Russia before making any alliance decision unacceptable, because 
this would be tantamount to an indirect Russian right of veto. 
Bonn differentiates between the offer of a "Partnership for 
Peace" including a voluntary right of consultation on a 
case-by-case basis and the more far-reaching Russian demand. In 
his talks with Yeltsin, Kohl will argue that Clinton, too, 
recommends the application of NATO's partnership concept to 
Russia. Like Kohl, Kinkel is considering the option of taking 
Russia's importance into account in this respect. In addition 
to the "Partnership for Peace" framework agreement that would be 
equal for all partners, the second part of the agreement, which 
will be formulated "individually" for every country, could 
contain modalities that would be tailored to Russia. Officials 
in Bonn believe that the signing of a partnership agreement with 
Russia could be made more attractive by accompanying it with a 
statement. They mention as an example of higher etiquette, a 
signing ceremony in the presence of the NATO Council and an 
address by its chairman. Bonn rules out Russia's NATO 
membership and its accession to the EU: "Then we might as well 
pack up." 
  Bonn assesses Russia's troop withdrawal agreement with 
Latvia as a favorable start. Bonn will presumably call upon 
Moscow to observe European rules in dealing with southern 
neighbors like Georgia. Kohl and Kinkel will express their wish 
for an early conclusion of a cooperation agreement between the 
EU and Moscow, and recommend to Moscow that it guarantee working 
alternatives for Western banks. The negotiations, including 
those on nonmilitary nuclear deals, are making slow progress. 
Bonn advocates preparatory talks this summer on the admittance 
of Russia to the Council of Europe. 
  The Federal Government does not consider feasible a joint 
farewell ceremony in Berlin for the Russian, U.S., British, and 
French troops in the presence of all chiefs of state and heads 
of government. Since Russian Supreme Commander Burlakov in 
eastern Germany has objected to the idea suggested by Kohl and 
Yeltsin that the influence of German classics on Russian 
literature of the 19th century should be mentioned in Weimar, 
and cultural ties for the future should be stressed, the 
compromise now will probably be that Yeltsin and Kohl will speak 
at a wreath-laying ceremony at the former Soviet memorial in 
Berlin-Treptow and at a subsequent meeting in the Russian 
Embassy in Berlin. If Yeltsin rejects Weimar, the ceremonies 
could be concentrated into half a day in Berlin; according to 
Bonn, the military presence should then be confined to a 
Bundeswehr detachment, a Russian guard of honor, and a Russian 
military band at the Treptow memorial. A week later, U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore, President Francois Mitterrand, and Prime 
Minister Major will seal the withdrawal of the protective powers 
in Berlin. Agreements in the wake of the Two-Plus-Four 
negotiations envision the Russian troop withdrawal from Germany 
by the end of 1995 -- which was advanced to the end of August 
1994 during Kohl's visit to Moscow in 1992 -- and the withdrawal 
of the Western contingents from Berlin at a later date, so that 
Bonn also considers a separate farewell justified for this 
reason as well. Bonn officials are annoyed with Burlakov, who 
with his criticism of Bonn's plans, and possibly with the 
protection of Grachev, is apparently trying -- so they say -- to 
nail Yeltsin down. 
  The talks on setting up a German consulate-general in 
Koenigsberg (Kaliningrad) will be difficult. When Kinkel was in 
Moscow in March, the Russian government was no longer ready to 
talk about the planned setting up of a German mission and said 
that this was a matter that had to be decided by the chiefs, 
Yeltsin and Kohl. Moscow hinted in March that Koenigsberg was a 
touchy issue. The Russian Security Council also put Koenigsberg 
on its agenda, in addition to the "Partnership for Peace." The 
return of German art objects, which is envisioned in the 
cultural agreement, is also disputed. 
<H5>  Russia Needs a Special Role </H5>
  CDU foreign policy expert Karl-Heinz Hornhues has advocated 
a 
contractual special relationship between Russia and NATO. 
Hornhues, who is deputy floor leader of the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union in the Bundestag, said 
in Bonn on 10 May that Russia was having problems with NATO's 
"Partnership for Peace" program, because, unlike the other 
Central and East European countries, Moscow was "independent" in 
foreign and defense policy terms and could look after its 
security on its own. However, the Soviet Union's former 
alliance partners had joined the "Partnership for Peace" to 
increase their security in cooperation with NATO. In addition, 
Russia maintained "political order" in East European and Central 
Asia, which was not welcomed but tolerated by the West, because 
the NATO states themselves were not prepared to make available 
to the United Nations or the CSCE peace troops for missions in 
Central Asia or the Caucasus. Hornhues said: "Without Russia, 
there would be no prospects for a just peace in the nationality 
conflicts between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, in Georgia or 
Tajikistan." Moscow's claim for a special relationship with the 
European Union and NATO was based on Russia's "security policy 
independence and its role as a power maintaining order." 
Hornhues said, however, that by speaking about "safeguarding 
Russian interests in nearby countries" and by stating big power 
claims, Russia also created the suspicion of pursuing 
neoimperialist goals. Nonetheless, the states of the Western 
alliance should think about "whether they should not offer 
Russia a special system of relations and treaties with NATO soon 
that clearly go beyond the Partnership for Peace." According to 
Hornhues, the preparedness to do so depends in particular on the 
United States, which "long ago developed a means of cooperation 
common between alliance partners" on problems of 
intercontinental and nuclear security. Hornhues said: "A 
special treaty relationship between Russia and NATO would not 
only diminish Russian reservations against membership of the 
Central and East European countries in NATO; for the Central and 
East European countries, too, closer Russian relations with NATO 
would mean more security."

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- According to President Boris 
Yeltsin, Russia wants to become a "member with equal rights" of 
all European institutions. Immediately before the start of his 
talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Yeltsin told journalists that 
he hoped to get the chancellor's support for this. Yeltsin 
announced that a new era of reconciliation will begin between 
the two nations after the Russian troops depart. 
  Kohl welcomed Yeltsin as a "friend of our country and our 
people." With reference to the dramatic changes in the world, 
he said it is now important for Russia and Germany to make the 
correct decisions with prudence and far-sightedness. He also 
expressed the hope that the reforms in Russia will be successful 
under Yeltsin's leadership. Kohl emphasized that there have 
been terrible but also great chapters in the history of the two 
states. They must learn from both the bad and the good things.

  [Text] The first meeting of the new Council of Ministers 
began at the Chigi Palace a short time ago. Let's go to 
Francesco Pionati. 
  [Pionati] Yes, the old guard has changed. The Ciampi 
executive has left office and has been replaced by the 
Berlusconi executive, which arrived here to hold the first 
meeting of the Council of Ministers. The meeting will be a short 
one and is needed to approve the choices of the new prime 
minister. These choices have already been made public; in other 
words, the appointments of the new deputy prime ministers -- 
Giuseppe Tatarella from the National Alliance and Roberto Maroni 
from the Northern League -- and the appointment of Gianni Letta 
to the post of under secretary to the Council of Ministers. 
Letta is already Berlusconi's right-hand man at Fininvest. 
  A second Council of Ministers meeting may be held tomorrow. 
This will serve to approve the appointments of the new under 
secretaries, or the deputy ministers as they are now called. 
  In the meantime, there have been further reactions to the 
Berlusconi government. Obviously the Freedom Alliance is 
extremely pleased, but the reaction of the opposition has been 
very scathing. This morning the Greens and La Rete [The 
Network] criticized the methods that led to the formation of the 
new government. They said the methods were the same as those 
used under the old political system. 
  Now let's listen to the views of Gianfranco Fini, on behalf 
of the Freedom Alliance, and Luigi Berlinguer and Rosa Russo 
Jervolino from the opposition -- from the left and the center 
respectively. 
  [Begin recording] [Fini] We are convinced that the formation 
of the Berlusconi government and the entry of five ministers 
from the National Alliance is an important landmark for Italy 
because it is the end of a democracy based on exclusion -- in 
other words a democracy based upon the ostracism of the parties 
with regard to the Right. The entry of the National Alliance in 
the government is the demonstration of the fact that today in 
Italy, as is the case throughout the rest of Europe and the 
West, the legitimization of the government is established by the 
free vote of the electorate. 
  [Berlinguer] Poor Berlusconi, my heart bleeds for him 
because he had to find an agreement for the impossible. He had 
to accommodate the Cossiga and Craxi factions, the followers of 
Andreotti and De Lorenzo, the men from his company, and finally 
the Italian Social Movement, the so-called postfascists, who are 
not very post and instead very tarred with the brush of fascism. 
What we have is a sort of mishmash that could have been better 
formulated by a chemist. Some of the ministers do not have much 
experience. We will see what happens, but the government has 
not gotten off to a good start. 
  [Jervolino] We from the Italian Popular Party are very 
concerned. We are worried at the way in which the government 
has been formed -- it has been a long drawn out carving up of 
ministries between the members of the Freedom Alliance. We are 
also concerned at the composition of the government and by the 
fact that sensitive posts have been given to people who do not 
have the necessary experience. We are also concerned by the 
presence of neofascists. We will wait to see what the 
government's program is, but already we believe that the 
composition of the government confirms our choice of going into 
opposition. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today met U.S. 
Ambassador Thomas Niles and discussed all national and Balkan 
issues. Papoulias also met Van Der Stoel, the CSCE high 
commissioner in charge of minorities. Correspondent Foivos 
Karzis reports: 
  [Begin recording] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and the 
U.S. Ambassador in Athens Thomas Niles this morning discussed 
Greek-Albanian relations, the issue of Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] in light of the upcoming 
talks with UN mediator Cyrus Vance, and the Yugoslav issue in 
view of the Geneva meeting on Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Foreign Ministry Secretary General Ambassador Khristos 
Zakharakis attended the meeting. Zakharakis will go to New York 
tomorrow to meet Vance on Friday [12 May] within the framework 
of the new round of talks on Skopje. He may also meet Matthew 
Nimetz, the U.S. presidential envoy on Skopje. 
  Papoulias made a detailed reference to the Greek-Albanian 
relations in light of his recent meeting in Zurich with his 
Albanian counterpart, Alfred Serreqi. He emphasized the rights 
of the Greek minority, the violation of religious rights, 
education issues, and the detention of five Omonoia members. 
  The foreign minister explained the same issues to Van der 
Stoel, the CSCE high commissioner in charge of minorities, who 
is visiting Athens. Van der Stoel is expected to submit a 
report. 
  Papoulias and Niles also discussed the Yugoslav issue. The 
Greek foreign minister will represent the European Union, as the 
head of the communal troika, at the meeting of the so-called 
contact group that has been formed. U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, and 
a representative of the UN secretary general will participate in 
the Geneva meeting. The main goal of the meeting would be a 
resumption of the talks between the three warring factions in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina through the return of the Bosnian Serbs to 
the negotiating table. According to reports, the Greek side 
will again make the suggestion that negotiations be linked with 
developments and the gradual lifting of the UN embargo against 
new Yugoslavia. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that the 
antiterrorism fight launched by the government is moving toward 
its conclusion step-by-step, with the support of the people. 
  Addressing True Path Party deputies, Ciller pointed out that 
significant success was achieved in this respect during the past 
few weeks. She said: Compare the nine years from 1984 to 1994 
with the period of the 50th government and you will see that the 
total number of terrorists caught or killed during the two 
periods is equal. Our government is continuing to wage a 
decisive and determined struggle to get this issue to the bottom 
of our agenda. We will fulfill our claim. We will not be 
embarrassed. We started off on this matter saying we will end 
it, and we are determined to bring it to a conclusion. 
  The prime minister stressed that the security forces, which 
carried out their duties with loyalty, self-sacrifice, and in a 
patriotic manner, played a major role in this success. She 
extended her gratitude to the security forces. 
  In her speech, Prime Minister Ciller pointed out that the 
talks held with the United Nations in connection with the 
Turkish unit that will serve in Bosnia-Herzegovina have ended. 
The Turkish unit will arrive there in the second half of June, 
she said, adding that this is the first time in the history of 
the republic that such a thing is happening. Ciller said: It 
is the first time that a Turkish unit is being sent to Europe. 
I cannot think of anything more natural, because the struggle 
in our country against terrorism and against illegal aggression 
is being waged everywhere without religious or racial 
discrimination. There were Turkish troops in Korea and in 
Somalia. Turkish politics opposed aggression during the last 
crisis in Iraq. Moreover, our country has always opposed 
aggression in Azerbaijan and everywhere else, without 
discrimination. As a result, nothing could be more natural than 
for a Turkish unit to take part in such a struggle in Europe. 
  Ciller said that most of the equipment needed for 
reinforcement of the Turkish unit and not found in the inventory 
of the Turkish Armed Forces is being acquired from public 
organizations, institutions, and through supplementary funds. 
  The prime minister stressed that by moving their heavy 
weapons to the outskirts of the city of Brcko and by effecting a 
military buildup to widen the (Kosovino) corridor, the Serbs are 
creating a new crisis in the region. She stated that the United 
Nations and NATO must urgently pass resolutions granting this 
region the status of a region purged of heavy weapons. This is 
essential, she said, to demonstrate once again the international 
community's determination against aggression and to deter the 
Serbs.

  [Text] The Hague, 10 May (ANP) -- Netherlands Development 
Aid Minister Pronk is leaving on Wednesday [11 May] for a visit 
to Rwanda, where fighting over recent weeks has left thousands 
dead. During his six-day trip, the minister also will visit 
refugee camps in the border area with Uganda and Tanzania, and 
hold talks with aid organizations in Kenya. 
  Pronk wants to see for himself how the process of providing 
aid for the victims of the violence is proceeding and what 
further assistance the Netherlands could provide. The 
Netherlands has already granted 8.4 million guilders 
(approximately 1.5 billion Belgian francs) in emergency aid for 
Rwanda and Burundi this year. From 14 May, the Netherlands aid 
organizations will be running a special campaign to raise funds 
for Rwanda. 
  The minister will first visit Uganda, from where he will 
visit refugee camps in the border area with northern Rwanda and 
talk with representatives from the aid organizations and 
possibly also with RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] members. He 
will also meet with Ugandan President Museveni and his deputy 
minister for refugee affairs. 
  On Saturday and Sunday, the minister will be in the Kenyan 
capital Nairobi for talks with international and private aid 
organizations, before flying on to Ngara in northwest Tanzania 
where hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees have gathered. 
Their number is rapidly increasing and the situation in 
northwest Tanzania is deteriorating daily. 
  The aid organization Caritas warned on Monday [9 May] that 
famine on an unknown scale threatened in Rwanda and neighboring 
Burundi. An estimated 2 million people have left their homes 
due to last month's outbreak of ethnic violence in Rwanda which 
followed the assassination of the country's president.

<F P=106> [Article signed KVB: "Informateur Tjeenk Willink Directs </F>
Investigation Into `Purple' Coalition"] 
  [Text] The Hague, 9 May (ANP) -- Tjeenk Willink, who is 
assessing on behalf of the queen whether a proposed government 
formation will succeed, is initially directing his exploratory 
investigation toward the political will of forming a "purple" 
coalition composed of the PvdA [Labor Party], the VVD [People's 
Party for Freedom and Democracy], and the D66 [Democrats 66]. 
To this end, he separately invited floor leaders Kok (PvdA), 
Bolkestein (VVD), and Van Mierlo (D66) for a talk, Willink's 
spokesman reported Monday [9 May]. 
  Before holding the meeting with the three floor leaders, 
Willink had an early morning talk with Second Chamber Chairman 
Deetman. He did so in Deetman's capacity as adviser of the 
queen. Tjeenk Willink has already been appointed adviser as 
speaker of the First Chamber. The political situation of the 
moment was reviewed by Tjeenk Willink on Monday evening by 
telephone with Vice President Scholten of the Council of State, 
the third direct adviser. 
  Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo were invited for 
deliberations about the possibility of forming a "purple" 
coalition since "the investigation into the `purple' coalition 
emerged as the most obvious choice from Monday's advising 
round." Most of the smaller political parties let Willink know 
that the "purple" coalition should first be considered. 
  During the talks, Tjeenk Willink wants to see whether there 
is the political will, especially with Kok and Bolkestein, to 
make the necessary efforts to set up a "purple" coalition. 
There will be no talk of the political contents on Tuesday, 
just the political will, about which Willink "wants to find out 
their innermost thoughts." 
  So far, for the next few days, no other talks have been 
planned with Willink apart from those with Kok, Bolkestein, and 
Van Mierlo, "unless it does not work," the spokesman said.

<F P=106> [Article signed KVB: "Kok Feels That There Is `Pretty Good' </F>
Chance for Serious Assessment of Purple Coalition"] 
  [Text] The Hague, 10 May (ANP) -- PvdA [Labor Party] leader 
Wim Kok feels that there is a "pretty good" chance that work can 
begin next week on a serious assessment of a "purple" coalition 
(without the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]). Kok said this 
Tuesday [10 May] following talks with Tjeenk Willink, who is 
assessing on behalf of the crown which government coalition is 
possible. 
  According to Kok, "logically priority must be given to the 
`purple' coalition." He felt that this kind of cooperation 
between the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], the 
PvdA, and the D66 [Democrats 66] must be "seriously tried out in 
all its possibilities." 
  Kok's statements were notable because on Monday he expressed 
major reservations about a "purple" coalition. According to 
some members of the group, a large current within the PvdA would 
prefer to cooperate with the VVD rather than undertake a 
secondary coalition with the CDA, whereas Kok is said to have 
serious doubts. Others deny, however, that there is talk of 
opposition between the floor leader and some of his rank and 
file regarding a "purple" coalition. 
  In the meantime, finance specialist Melkert has begun 
putting 
together a "formation report" listing the possible bottlenecks 
that could arise in the government formation talks and the 
PvdA's stake in the negotiations. According to Melkert, the 
document is not specifically aimed at talks to form a "purple" 
coalition. 
  The biggest differences between the PvdA and the three other 
large parties can be found in the area of social security and 
the reorganization of government spending. The VVD wants all 
new benefits to be lowered to 60 percent of the minimum wage. 
The CDA wants to put a freeze on benefits for four years. The 
PvdA, however, wants to link them to wages in the market sector 
as much as possible.

<F P=106> [Article signed KVB: "Van Mierlo: `Every Day Is a Little </F>
More Purple'"] 
  [Text] The Hague, 10 May (ANP) -- D66 [Democrats 66] 
chairman Hans Van Mierlo "is even more optimistic than 
yesterday" about the advent of a "purple" [D66, Labor Party, and 
People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] coalition. He said 
this Tuesday [10 May] following his meeting with Tjeenk Willink, 
who is consulting on behalf of the crown on which government 
coalition is possible. 
  Van Mierlo, who let it be known through Tjeenk Willink that 
nothing more could be said about the content of the talk, said 
that "there was no reason for pessimism. We are moving forward 
one step at a time and every day things are getting a little 
more purple." 
  On Tuesday, Tjeenk Willink received the floor leaders of the 
three parties which must be part of the "purple coalition." Now 
that it looks like these talks will be successful, there is an 
expectation that Tjeenk Willink will talk with these three at 
the same time. Observers in The Hague do not rule out that 
Tjeenk Willink will be able to present the queen with his 
conclusions this week, meaning that his information-gathering 
efforts lasted shorter than he was expecting on Monday.

<F P=106> [Kevin Brown report: "Clarke Demands Support for Major"] </F>
  [Text] Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday sought 
to rule out a challenge to Mr John Major's leadership by warning 
that the Conservative party was "finished" unless it rallied 
round the prime minister. 
  In a tough speech to the Scottish Conservative party 
conference in Inverness, reinforced in comments to journalists, 
Mr Clarke tied the future of the government firmly to the 
survival of the prime minister. 
  "We will be finished if we do not support the prime minister 
from now until the next general election and beyond. The 
Conservative party has remained in power for so long because it 
has a readily identifiable set of principles, and because it has 
held together as a cohesive party of government," he said. 
  "The leader deserves loyalty and we will stay in office if 
we 
stay behind him." 
  Mr Clarke's warning, delivered before news filtered through 
to the conference of the death of Mr John Smith, the Labour 
leader, follows similar declarations of support for Mr Major 
from Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Forsyth, 
the rightwing employment minister. 
  The chancellor dismissed claims by Mr Henning 
Christopherson, 
vice-president of the European Commission, that UK economic 
growth was likely to slow from 2.5 per cent this year to 2.3 per 
cent in 1995-96 because of tax increases. 
  Mr Clarke said Mr Christopherson's analysis -- delivered in 
the commission's latest assessment of the economic prospects of 
the European Union's member states -- was "out of date." He 
said there were plenty of data to show that tax increases were 
not slowing consumer demand.

<F P=106> [Phillip Stephens report: "Major Rejects Tory Demands for </F>
Referendum on Europe"] 
  [Text] Mr John Major yesterday rejected calls from 
Conservative Eurosceptics to commit his government now to a 
referendum on the next stage of European integration. 
  But he sought to defuse Tory party tensions ahead of next 
month's European elections by insisting he would adopt a tough 
stance against further integration at the 1996 intergovernmental 
conference. 
  With his leadership again under fire, Mr Major also 
underlined his determination not to be driven from office. He 
told MPs: "We received a five-year mandate to carry out our 
policies. I intend to exercise that five-year mandate." 
  Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will seek to repair 
damage caused by the row when he outlines the key planks of the 
Conservatives' European manifesto to the Scottish Tory 
conference later today. 
  Mr Hurd will stress that the underlying forces shaping 
Europe 
point to a flexible, multi-speed union, in which Britain can 
feel entirely comfortable -- rather than to the centralised and 
uniform entity feared by Tory Eurosceptics. 
  After two days of confusion and division in Tory ranks, Mr 
Major responded to opposition attacks by refusing to promise a 
referendum on the outcome of the 1996 conference. 
  He left open the possibility that a future government might 
take a different view if there was a move to a single European 
currency. But Downing Street stressed that the referendum issue 
was off the agenda for the foreseeable future. 
  Despite an upsurge in support for the referendum idea as a 
potential device to unite the Conservatives before the June 9 
European poll, Mr Major indicated there is no question of such a 
proposal appearing in the party's manifesto. 
  He had not changed his mind since voicing vigorous 
opposition 
to a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty. He agreed with Sir 
Terence Higgins, a senior backbench MP, that such votes were "an 
alien concept inconsistent with our system of representative 
parliamentary democracy." 
  Pledging not to agree to any new arrangements in 1996 which 
were unacceptable to the British Parliament, Mr Major added: "I 
don't believe the question of a referendum arises now and it 
certainly doesn't need to be decided now." 
  He dismissed calls from Tory Eurosceptics for a commitment 
to 
call a referendum on a future single European currency but in a 
nod in their direction refused to rule out a change of heart by 
a future parliament. Pro-European Tories, who have campaigned 
against any referendum commitment, expressed themselves 
satisfied with Mr Major's stance while the sceptics claimed he 
had not closed the door entirely on their referendum demands. 
  Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, taunted Mr Major for 
presiding over a "hopelessly divided" cabinet.

<F P=106> [Nicholas Wood report: "Hurd Offers Tory Sceptics </F>
Pick'n'Mix Vision of Europe"] 
  [Text] John Major's vision of a Britain at the heart of 
Europe was drastically revised by Douglas Hurd yesterday as he 
mounted a new attempt to stifle Tory feuding before the June 
European elections. 
  The Foreign Secretary dismissed Eurosceptic fears that the 
country was moving inexorably towards a European superstate. 
Instead, the impetus was towards a multispeed Europe in which 
countries such as Britain would be free to move into the slow 
lane at will. 
  Mr Hurd told the Scottish Conservative Party conference in 
Inverness that the "new Europe" would be marked by greater 
diversity and flexibility. Already, sub-groups of member states 
worked together on matters of common interest while others stood 
aloof. Examples included the ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism] -- 
where Britain and Italy were no longer members the frontier-free 
customs union based on the Benelux states, and the Western 
European Union -- the defence grouping excluding Ireland. 
  Mr Hurd said: "This is a multitrack, multispeed, even 
multilayered approach which will increasingly be the way of the 
future. It threatens no one. A more flexible Europe offers more 
scope to involve countries which are not full members in the 
activities of the union." Later, speaking to reporters, he 
spoke of Britain "picking and choosing" from the European menu. 
  Although Mr Hurd denied that he was consigning Britain to 
the 
European slow lane -- shorthand for hardline Euroscepticism -- 
the clear thrust of his message was that the sceptics fears were 
groundless and that Germany, for instance, was moving Britains 
way over deregulation and subsidiarity. But these worries still 
surfaced in the debate as Mr Hurd faced calls for a referendum 
on a single currency and warnings that if the Government did not 
heed popular alarm about loss of powers to Brussels it would be 
"annihilated" in June. 
  The Foreign Secretary contrasted Tory defence of Britains 
interest in Europe with Labour and Liberal Democrat alleged 
readiness to accept a federal superstate. He also repeated his 
warning to the party "not to scratch at old wounds" and 
concentrate on the Europe of the future. 
  "As strong pro-Europeans we shall campaign on the open 
trading, deregulating, co-operative Europe which we want. Our 
opponents will stick to the out-of-date notion that the only 
good European is one who transfers chunks of power to Brussels 
at regular intervals until there is one centralised executive 
and one centralised parliament." 
  Mr Hurd made jobs and the national veto his main themes. The 
opposition parties would sign the social chapter and throw 
people out of work. They would abandon the veto and "yield on 
all points."

<F P=106> [Martin Linton report: "Most Want Major To Quit Now"] </F>
  [Text] More than half Britain's voters and a quarter of 
Conservatives believe John Major should resign after his party's 
disastrous results in the local elections without waiting for 
next month's European elections, which could leave him with an 
even more humiliating defeat on his hands. 
  A poll taken by ICM [International Communications and 
Marketing Research] for the Guardian shows 27 percent intend to 
vote Conservative in the Euro-elections against 44 percent for 
Labour and 24 percent for the Liberal Democrats -- a result that 
could cost the Conservatives half their 32 seats. 
  John Major's woes were compounded last night as pressure 
grew 
for the resignation of one of his ministers, Nicholas Scott, who 
was forced to make a humiliating apology to MPs after admitting 
he had misled the Commons. 
  In a personal statement, Mr Scott, minister for the 
disabled, 
said he was wrong to deny that his department was not involved 
in attempts to wreck a bill on disabled rights. 
  In next month's European election, Conservative-held seats 
would fall to 16, with the party holding only one seat outside 
its traditional heartland in the South-east, according to a 
projection made from the poll by John Curtice of Strathclyde 
University. 
  Labour would emerge as the clear winner with 57 of the 87 
seats, but the Liberal Democrats would make the most dramatic 
gains, taking almost the entire West Country and winning nine 
seats, their first in the European Parliament. 
  The poll was taken in the wake of the local elections on 
Friday and Saturday and asked a sample of 1,483 people whether, 
given the results, Mr Major should continue as Prime Minister. 
Fifty-three percent said he should resign and 33 percent said 
he should continue. 
  But what will be undoubtedly more worrying for Mr Major is 
that support for his resignation goes far beyond Labour and 
Liberal Democrat voters with 24 percent of Conservative voters 
saying he should resign. 
  Conservatives are usually the most loyal to their party 
leader, but Mr Major now has the support of only two thirds of 
Tory voters, and they represent little more than a quarter of 
the electorate, hardly a strong position for a Prime Minister 
going into an election campaign. 
  Even if the Conservatives win the same vote as in the local 
elections, they are likely to have far less to show for it 
because of the way in which European elections work. When a 
party does well, it sweeps the board. When it does badly, it 
can quickly be wiped off the map. 
  The large size of the constituencies coupled with the 
British 
first-past-the-post voting system -- which Mr Major insisted on 
retaining against strong pressure from the European Parliament 
-- together with the concentration of Liberal Democrat support, 
combine to spell disaster for the Conservatives. 
  It has always been known that the Conservatives become 
particularly vulnerable if their vote falls below 30 percent in 
an election, but it has never happened in the party's history at 
local or general elections until last Thursday. 
  Below this level the even spread of Conservative support 
around the country turns from an advantage to a disadvantage. 
  In the last three European elections the Liberals have won 
no 
seats and have blamed the first-past-the-post system, the only 
nonproportional system used anywhere in the European elections. 
Ironically the system could turn to their advantage in this 
election. 
  If the Conservative vote falls during the campaign, they 
could rapidly find themselves with a risible number of seats. 
It seems unlikely that John Major could survive that. 
  Labour's support in the poll -- 44 percent -- is four points 
down from their rating in April. Now research by the Guardian's 
pollsters, ICM, suggests that a more realistic Labour lead in a 
general election may be as low as 10 points.

<F P=106> [Janet Bush and James Landale report: "Bank Governor Warns </F>
Treasury Over Risks of Dash for Growth"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The Governor of the Bank of England, 
increasingly on a collision course with the Chancellor over 
interest rate policy, yesterday warned the Government against 
going for faster growth because of its political problems and 
the risk of a 1980's-style boom and bust. 
  Eddie George, the ever more outspoken Governor, urged the 
Government not to be tempted into "policy short-termism" but to 
pursue steady and sustained growth. He appealed to the 
Government and the public to get used to the idea of a slow 
recovery with none of the feel-good factor of the 1980's boom. 
  In a speech to businessmen last night he acknowledged that 
people were saying that it still does not feel much like a 
recovery. "But that is precisely the point -- we have to avoid 
the excesses of the late 1980's, which felt wonderfully good in 
the short term, but which were the root cause of the misery that 
followed," Mr George said. 
  His speech came the day after the Bank of England published 
its latest Inflation Report, published every three months, which 
indirectly blamed the recent rise in interest rates on Britain's 
money and bond markets on the Chancellor's insistence at his 
February meeting with the governor on a quarter-point cut in 
base rates. 
  Officials at the Bank are increasingly concerned that the 
Government, battered by the poor showing in the local polls and 
the prospect of heavy defeats in next months European elections, 
will be tempted to throw away its anti-inflation discipline in 
favour of a politically popular go-for-growth policy. 
  The Governor's call yesterday for cautious 
"stability-oriented" policies came on the day that the European 
Commission revised downwards its prediction for British economic 
growth next year. The Commission said that Britain would 
probably achieve the 2.5 percent growth rate estimated by the 
Treasury this year, but now believes that tax increases will 
slow growth to only 2.3 percent next year. In November, the 
Commission had been looking for 2.7 percent growth in 1995. 
  Although Britain is currently outperforming the rest of 
Europe, which entered recession much later, the latest 
Commission growth forecasts predict that Britain will have a 
slower rate of growth next year than the rest of the Community, 
which it expects to rise to 2.5 percent. 
  Mr George's hard-line stance on interest rates, underlined 
in 
both the Inflation Report and in his speech last night, is 
likely to put him on a collision course with Kenneth Clarke, the 
Chancellor, particularly if the economic recovery decelerates 
later this year because of higher taxes. 
  The Bank's criticism of the February 8 rate cut has now 
become highly public, to increasing irritation within the 
Treasury. The cut was decided only after a difficult two-day 
meeting, with Mr George opposed to another easing in monetary 
policy and Mr Clarke arguing for a larger 0.5-point cut. 
  The Bank has become increasingly public in its views about 
economic management, aided by Mr Clarke who has campaigned for 
more openness in economic policy decision-making but who is now 
having to face the consequences in the form of a publicly 
critical central bank. 
  On the February 8 base rate signal, Mr Clarke said that it 
was "as plain as a pikestaff" that the decision to cut was the 
right one. Mr George was unrepentant about his opposition, 
saying: "It is debatable whether I lost the argument. I lost 
the decision." 
  The City was disappointed yesterday with news that Britain's 
manufacturing production had fallen by 0.5 percent in March and 
that even industrial output, which includes North Sea oil and 
gas, had fallen by 0.6 percent.

<F P=106> [Roger Cowe report: "Buoyant BP Plans British Gas Link-up"] </F>
  [Text] The oil company, BP, is contemplating international 
exploration joint ventures with British Gas. The BP chief 
executive, David Simon, said yesterday that under its new 
leadership British Gas was more open to new ideas, including 
joint investment in new ventures. 
  He said the gas company had excellent pipeline technology 
which would fit well with BP's exploration expertise. "It's high 
time we worked together." 
  He added that he knew the British Gas chairman Sir Richard 
Giordano well, because they were both members of the Grand 
Metropolitan board. 
  Mr Simon was commenting after announcing a surprise leap in 
profits and a shock dividend increase for the first quarter of 
the year. 
  On the normal historic cost basis, pre-tax profits fell from 
700 million pounds in the first quarter last year to 577 million 
pounds. But this was due to losses on oil stocks because of the 
fall in oil prices. On a replacement cost basis excluding these 
stock factors, the operating profits rose from 585 million 
pounds to 601 million pounds. 
  Lower interest costs following the heavy debt reduction 
programme also helped to stimulate cash flows, which showed a 
net inflow of 461 million pounds, including more than 100 
million pounds from selling businesses. 
  Encouraged by the recovery in profits and cash flows despite 
the low oil price, the BP board decided to increase the dividend 
for the first time since it was cut dramatically in the summer 
of 1992. A 20 per cent increase pleased investors, and the 
company's share price rose by 16.5p [pence] during the day. 
  Mr Simon was keen to stress that this rate of increase could 
not be expected in future quarters, however. "It has been an 
encouraging quarter," he said. He denied that BP had been under 
pressure from shareholding institutions to increase the dividend. 
  BP's surprisingly buoyant results were due to a spectacular 
leap in profits from its UK operations, due partly to higher 
production of gas from the company's UK fields. UK profits, on 
the replacement cost basis, soared from 105 million pounds in 
the first quarter of last year, to 306 mi11ion pounds this time. 
  Most of this profit came from oil and gas production, but UK 
refining and marketing moved from a small loss to profit of 41 
pounds million. The chemical operations reversed a 19 million 
loss to a profit of the same amount. 
  U.S. production profit slumped because of maintenance work 
on 
Alaskan wells, but U.S. refining and marketing moved into profit.

  [Text] Bonn -- At the end of his visit to Bonn, Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin met Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on 
Friday [13 May]. Diplomatic circles report that the problems of 
an all-European security structure were at the center of the 
talks held at the government's guest house near Bonn. 
  Kinkel had said before the meeting that Bonn and Moscow have 
also made some progress on the question of returning German 
cultural assets taken to Russia during World War II. 
  After the talks, Yeltsin traveled to Baden-Wuerttemberg on 
the last leg of his journey. Talks with Minister President 
Erwin Teufel and representatives of industry in Stuttgart and 
Ludwigsburg will focus on the deepening of economic relations.

  [Text] Wuenstorf (DPA) -- This weekend, the Western Group 
of Russian Armed Forces will commemorate the anniversary of the 
German capitulation on 8 May 1945 for the last time on German 
soil. On Saturday afternoon [7 May], its Supreme Command 
honored the millions of Soviet soldiers who were killed in World 
War II with a concert in its Wuenstorf (Brandenburg) 
headquarters. 
  Brandenburg Minister-President Manfred Stolpe (Social 
Democratic Party of Germany -- SPD) promised the Russian forces, 
which will be withdrawn by the end of August, that Brandenburg 
will honor the memory of the dead Soviet soldiers in the Seelow 
mountains, Baruth, and other places. Stolpe said that many 
Germans had also experienced the victory of the Red Army over 
Hitler fascism as a day of liberation. 
  This Sunday, representatives of the Western Group will lay 
wreaths in military cemeteries and at other memorials in 
Brandenburg and Berlin. On 9 May, a large military show marking 
"victory day" will be held at Wuenstorf headquarters. The 
Brandenburg land government will see off the Russian Armed 
Forces with a festive rally in Potsdam on 29 July.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Another group of German citizens from 
Yemen arrived in Djibouti Saturday evening [7 May]. According 
to a Foreign Ministry spokesperson in Bonn, two Bundeswehr 
Transall aircraft flew a total of 129 passengers, mainly all 
women and children, out of the Yemeni capital of Sana'a. 
One-third of the passengers come from EU [European Union] 
member states. The operation will be continued this Sunday. 
  The Defense Ministry has said that another Transall aircraft 
was transferred from Bahrain to Djibouti in support of the 
evacuation operation, so that three aircraft, which can each 
take about 90 passengers, could be used in a shuttle service. 
According to the Foreign Ministry, the approximately 250 German 
citizens in Yemen had been called upon by Deutsche Welle to 
gather in the capital, if possible. 
  On 6 May, the first group of approximately 20 German 
citizens 
was taken from the South Yemeni port city of Aden to the French 
warship Jules Verne in Djibouti. They and almost 600 other 
foreigners were taken out of the country by the French Navy. A 
spokesman of the French troops deployed in Djibouti told the 
radio station France Info that another French ship was cruising 
off the coast of Yemen, if another evacuation operation had to 
be carried out. There were currently no plans to use aircraft, 
he said.

  [Text] Aachen (DPA) -- At the start of the European 
election campaign, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian 
Democratic Union -- CDU) has demonstrated optimism about 
economic prospects in Germany and has clearly expressed himself 
in favor of the European unification process. He said at a 
rally in front of the Aachen Cathedral that peace and freedom 
are only possible in a united Europe; this holds true also for 
the long-term safeguarding of the economic sector, jobs, and the 
social system. 
  Following the most serious cyclical crisis since World War 
II, the order books are filling again now, the rate of inflation 
is about 3 percent and, for the first time in a long period, GNP 
is increasing again, said the chancellor. In his speech, which 
was repeatedly interrupted by some demonstrators, Kohl told his 
audience of approximately 3,000 that he advocated a common 
European policy in the struggle against organized crime. "The 
struggle against the mafia and international drug trafficking is 
an all-European responsibility," he said. 
  He called upon foreigners living in Germany not to misuse 
their right as guests and to pursue political goals in a 
peaceful way: "We will not tolerate citizens being terrorized in 
the streets and squares." Kohl and Federal Labor Minister 
Norbert Bluem, the chief of the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU, and 
CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze stressed that almost every 
third job in Germany is marked by exports to other EU [European 
Union] member states. 
  Kohl, who was received by roughly 100 demonstrators with 
shrill catcalls, called the protesters "descendants of the 
socialist migration of peoples." He said it was a great 
achievement for him to receive Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
on 11 May, shortly after the anniversary of the German 
capitulation, for talks on details of the definitive Russian 
troop withdrawal. 
  In view of the European parliamentary elections to be held 
within five weeks (12 June), it is our duty "to do everything to 
build a Europe in which wars are no longer possible." In 
connection with German unity, the chancellor sharply attacked 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. He said he could 
tolerate criticism from the jobless in the new laender. 
However, he did not need criticism from the SPD, "which had 
long betrayed German unity." The Social Democrats had been 
prepared to "go down on their knees" before Erich Honecker, the 
chief of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Kohl said that 
"the flourishing landscapes" in the new federal laender were 
progressing well.

  [Text] Eutin (DPA) -- In the opinion of FRG Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union), European unification 
has to be advanced, in order to secure Germany's economic 
future. "We will only be able to maintain our place in the 
world if we compete together with others," Kohl said at an 
European election event of his party in Eutin 
(Schleswig-Holstein) on Tuesday evening [10 May]. Every fourth 
job in the old laender depends on exports to countries of the 
European Union, Kohl stressed. German unity and European 
unification are two sides of the "same coin," Kohl emphasized. 
"If we do the right thing now, peace and freedom in Europe will 
be secured in the 21st century." 
  According to the chancellor, a single currency in a joint 
Europe must, above all, be stable. The FRG Government will not 
agree to a European currency if it does not have the same 
stability and quality as the German mark. At the rally, in 
which, according to police estimates, about 1,000 people 
participated, Kohl welcomed the decision in favor of Frankfurt 
on Main as the seat of the future European central bank. 
  In the domestic policy part of his speech, Kohl said that, 
in 
his opinion, the FRG has overcome the economic low. There is an 
upward tendency. There are encouraging signs; a stable currency 
and a low inflation rate are the "most social policy." [as

Council of Ministers of the European Union [EU], will give "an 
important role" to the German economy. Not only South Africa, 
but all states in southern Africa will participate in the 
conference. Kinkel made the plans known immediately after his 
return from the festivities on the occasion of President Nelson 
Mandela's inauguration in Pretoria. He had had talks both with 
Mandela and Vice President Frederik Willem de Klerk, he said.

  [Excerpt] Hamburg (DPA) -- The reactions of most alliance 
partners to the inclusion of five neofascists in Berlusconi's 
government were characterized by embarrassed reserve. 
  In Bonn, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic 
Party of Germany) hoped for the continuation of the "excellent 
cooperation, above all in the European integration process," 
with his new counterpart, Antonio Martino. However, Heidemarie 
Wieczorek-Zeul, deputy chairwoman of the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany, said that the appointment of five neofascist 
ministers is "a shame for Italy and Europe." The Christian 
Social Union is concerned that "Mussolini's grandsons" were able 
"to gain part of the power." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn -- According to Social Democratic Party Deputy 
Volker Neumann, three Bundestag deputies have interrupted an 
inspection visit to the autonomous Kurdish regions in northern 
Iraq because of heavy fighting between hostile Kurdish groups. 
Neumann reported in Bonn on Monday [9 April] that several 
hundred people have already been killed in the war between 
Mas'ud Barzani's Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK) and Jalal 
Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The two party 
leaders cooperate in a coalition government of the autonomous 
region, while their supporters attacked one another on their way 
to negotiations. 
  The German delegation was led by the chairman of the 
Bundestag Subcommittee for Humanitarian Issues, Friedrich Vogel 
(Christian Democratic Union -- CDU). Heinrich Lummer (CDU) was 
the third participant. Neumann reported that members of aid 
organizations, including Eberhard Walde of the German liaison 
office in the region, have left the region, because their 
security can no longer be guaranteed. Representatives of the 
two warring parties called this "the saddest day" since Saddam 
Husayn's anti-Kurdish massacrers. 
  The deputies wanted to obtain some information on the extent 
of reconstruction aid provided for the autonomous region in 
Iraq, to which the Federal Government, and especially the 
laender of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia have 
contributed. Germany's food aid could, however, be largely 
discontinued due to good harvests in 1992 and 1993, Neumann 
said. In these two years, Bonn provided almost 40 million marks 
in humanitarian aid.

  [Text] Bonn -- The Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] expects a "considerable number" of Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] delegates to vote for 
SPD candidate Johannes Rau in the upcoming presidential 
elections. This has been indicated by relevant messages from 
CDU/CSU delegates, mainly from the new laender, SPD Manager 
Guenter Verheugen told journalists in Bonn on Tuesday [10 May]. 
  He ruled out any tactical maneuvers by the SPD in the 
Federal 
Assembly votes. The Social Democrats will vote for Rau all the 
way through. Speculations that the SPD will vote for the Free 
Democratic Party candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher in the third 
round are unfounded, [Verheugen said].

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- At its meeting in Munich on 7 May, 
the Bavarian Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] nominated 
Renate Schmidt almost unanimously as its top candidate for the 
Landtag elections on 25 September. In a secret ballot, the SPD 
land chairperson got 244 of 246 valid votes. There was one 
abstention and one no-vote. It is the SPD's election goal this 
fall to break the absolute majority of the Christian Social 
Union.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Christian Social Union [CSU] 
Chairman Theo Waigel rejected the call of Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen for an 
action alliance against the Republikaner by calling it an 
"obvious propaganda proposal." As long as the SPD only deals 
with right-wing extremists, but not also with left-wing radicals 
and the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS], the CSU does not 
see a basis for a joint course of action, Waigel said before 
journalists after a session of the CSU Executive Committee in 
Munich. Moreover, the CSU does not need an exhortation. Unlike 
any other party, it is struggling against the Republikaner 
"politically and with all legally available means."

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- In March, the money supply, M-3, 
increased by 4.9 percent over the fourth quarter of 1993. This 
leads to an extrapolated annual rate of 15.4 percent. With this 
final figure, the Bundesbank on Tuesday [10 May] slightly 
modified the figures it had originally predicted. The original 
annual rate indicated for March had been 15.2 percent. 
  The M-3 money supply contains the circulation of notes and 
coins, cash deposits, time deposits under four years, as well as 
savings deposits. There was an extremely large increase in the 
stock of money due to special factors at the beginning of this 
year. This "basic effect" influences monthly figures. For 
1994, the Bundesbank is aiming at a money supply growth rate of 
4 to 6 percent.

  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 12 -- Prefect Claudio Gelati, 55, 
was today named chef de cabinet at the Interior Ministry by 
Minister Roberto Maroni, who confirmed Gelati at the post he was 
moved to earlier this year by former Interior Minister Nicola 
Mancino. 
  Before taking on the portfolio with his swearing in 
yesterday, Maroni said he intended to keep on the job the senior 
civil servants who had been managing the affairs of the 
ministry's departments. 
  Still to name are the officials who usually become the 
minister's closest aides, the chief of the secretariat, the 
personal secretary and the head of the ministry's press office. 
  The chef de cabinet served earlier, at the end of last year, 
as special commissioner for Milan when the great northern city 
was temporarily without a mayor.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "League Member To Head Parliamentary </F>
Immunity Body"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 12 -- Marco Preioni of the Northern 
League on Thursday [12 May] was elected president of the Upper 
House body that rules over judicial requests to withdraw 
parliamentary immunity against senators. 
  Preioni obtained 12 votes against the 11 won by outgoing 
president Giovanni Pellegrino of the Left Democrat Party. Two 
elections were needed because the first resulted in a tie 
between Preioni and Pellegrino. 
  The new vice presidents of the commission are Lino Diana of 
the People's Party and Elidio De Paoli of the Lombard Alpine 
League. 
  Although approval by the body and a subsequent vote by the 
full assembly are no longer necessary to lift parliamentary 
immunity from investigation, magistrates still need the green 
light from the committee to carry out searches, telephone taps 
and preventive detention of legislators, unless the crimes carry 
mandatory arrests and/or prison sentences of more than five 
years. 
  Lawmakers can also be arrested without permission from the 
legislative body if they are caught in the act of committing a 
serious crime. 
  Preioni, 43, was a registered lawyer and a secondary school 
teacher before being elected to the Senate with the Northern 
League in 1992. He was a member of the Justice commission and 
of the same body he now chairs. 
  Preioni's election set off a series of protests and 
criticisms from opposition parties, who accused the three 
right-wing coalition partners of bullying their way to the top 
of all institutional bodies, even those that traditionally have 
been led by the opposition. 
  "This government coalition," a communique from the Left 
Democrat Party Senate caucus said, "is so power hungry that it 
makes the old five-party coalition seem like a club of gentlemen 
by comparison." 
  A right-wing Senate whip this morning announced the majority 
would do the exact opposite of what it actually did when it 
elected Preioni, the communique said, adding that the election 
contradicts a tradition that gives chairmanships of many 
commissions to the opposition parties. 
  With a majority and the chair of the body in charge of 
granting waiver of parliamentary immunity, critics say, the 
League could protect its own members of parliament from 
prosecution. 
  "In Italy and in other civil countries there is a tradition 
that gives leadership of this sort of body to the opposition," 
Lower House Left Democrat whip Luigi Berlinguer commented. 
  Livio Caputo of Forza Italia responded that there was no 
"provocatory intent" in the election of Preioni and called the 
entire affair an unfortunate "stop-gap incident" caused by 
technical reasons. He said the present state of affairs may 
turn out to be temporary. 
  Even the former Christian Democrats, who led coalition 
governments for 40 years before falling apart in the wake of 
corruption scandals, criticized the election of a majority 
senator. 
  Nicola Mancino, who heads the senators of the party, now 
renamed the People's Party, said this state of affairs will 
"stiffen" relations between majority and opposition, especially 
after the election of Carlo Scognamiglio of Forza Italia as 
Senate speaker.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Storm Over Fascists Caused by </F>
Translation Error"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg 6 May (ANSA) -- A translation mistake in 
a text approved Thursday [5 May] by the European Parliament 
[EP], which in the Italian version raised alarm about the 
presence of Fascists in a new Rome government, appeared to be 
the cause of heated protests by the Italian Right against what 
it labeled interference in Italy's domestic affairs. 
  European Parliament Speaker Egon Klepsch on Friday announced 
that part of a sentence, referring to "the horrors of Nazism and 
of Fascism," mistakenly was not removed from the Italian 
language version of a motion approved by the assembly urging 
Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to make it clear that the 
new government under Silvio Berlusconi must "remain faithful to 
the fundamental values underlying the creation of the European 
Community." 
  The motion was evidently directed at the prospect that the 
neofascist National Alliance would be given cabinet posts in the 
new government and caused indignant and offended reactions from 
members of the party. 
  The Socialist Party whip in the European Parliament, Jean 
Pierre Cot of France, today stated that removal of the contested 
phrase from the motion, a phrase which did not appear in the 
other language versions, does not change the substance of the 
message. "The Parliament has expressed its concern over the 
Italian political situation," Cot stressed, adding that "the 
form of the translation does not change the substance." 
  (National Alliance officials in Rome today continued to 
issue 
statements lambasting the European Parliament, claiming they are 
not fascists and calling "unsatisfactory" the explanations given 
by Klepsch. Party leader Gianfranco Fini also asserted he had 
"several Jewish friends," was not anti-Semitic, and "loved 
democracy and freedom.")

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Voter Survey on June 12 Elections"] </F>
  [Text] Rome 6 May (ANSA) -- Forza Italia, National Alliance 
[AN] and two left-wing opposition parties, the Democratic Party 
of the Left [PDS] and Communist Refoundation [Communist 
Renewal], will all gain votes in the June 12 European Parliament 
elections compared to the March 27 general elections, according 
to a CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research] survey released 
Friday [6 May]. 
  The poll results, to be published in the next issue of the 
news weekly, L'ESPRESSO, show that Silvio Berlusconi's Forza 
Italia party would obtain 24.2 percent of the vote, compared to 
21.1 percent in March, while its neo-Fascist government partner, 
National Alliance, would increase its votes by 1.1 percent. 
  The Northern League on the other hand would drop 1.1 percent 
compared to the previous elections, CIRM said. 
  The Left democrats would increase their votes by 1.4 percent 
and Communist Refoundation by 0.9 percent, according to CIRM, 
which did not say how it was able to separate the parties, both 
right and left, which in the March elections were running under 
the same ticket. 
  The opposition Greens would remain stable while the Pact for 
Italy would lose 0.8 percent and the former Christian Democrats 
of the People's Party would lose 0.5 percent. The Pannella 
Ticket, too, would drop by 1.5 percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italy's Balance of Trade With EU </F>
Still in Black"] 
  [Text] Rome 6 May (ANSA) -- Italy's balance of trade with 
the other nations of the European Union [EU] was still in the 
black in January, by 390 billion lire (244 million dollars), 
compared to a surplus of 1.72 trillion lire (1.075 billion 
dollars) reported for January 1993. 
  According to provisional data made public today by ISTAT, 
the 
National Statistics Institute, imports from the EU nations 
surged in January this year by 24.6 percent while Italian 
exports rose by only 6.7 percent. 
  In total trade in January, Italy showed a surplus of 235 
billion lire (147 million dollars), compared to a figure of 235 
billion in the black in the same month last year. 
  Imports, said ISTAT, rose by 14.1 percent, to 19.1 trillion 
lire, while exports came to a value of 19.335 trillion, up by 
9.7 percent. 
  In trade with the Community, France and Germany held their 
positions as Italy's major partners. In trade with France, Italy 
achieved a surplus of 114 billion lire and, with Germany, a 
surplus of 437 billion, compared to surpluses of 112 billion in 
trade with Britain, 165 billion with Greece, 198 billion with 
Portugal and 188 billion with Spain. 
  The Italian figures were in deficit in trade with Belgium 
and 
Luxembourg, by 250 billion lire, the Netherlands, by 410 
billion, Ireland, 108 billion and Denmark, 56 billion lire. 
  Following is a sector-by-sector breakdown of the Italian 
trade balance with the EU nations, in billions of lire (one

<F P=106> [Luis R. Aizpeolea report: "PSOE Executive Committee </F>
Selects Almunia as New Parliamentary Group Spokesman"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Joaquin Almunia, PSOE [Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party] Secretary for Studies and Programs, was 
selected yesterday as Socialist parliamentary group chairman and 
spokesman, replacing Carlos Solchaga. His candidacy, supported 
by Felipe Gonzalez, won the assent of the Socialist Federal 
Executive Committee, which met at 1700 at the party's central 
headquarters in Ferraz Street (Madrid). The Socialist group 
will vote on the Executive Committee's proposal in plenary 
session today. During yesterday's meeting, Extremadura Junta 
[autonomous government] Premier Juan Carlos Rodriguez Ibarra 
unsuccessfully championed Alfonso Guerra's alternative. 
  Gonzalez' aim in proposing Joaquin Almunia as Socialist 
parliamentary group chairman was to have at his disposal a man 
with considerable political influence in order to tackle the 
difficult times experienced by the party. Solchaga's 
replacement will have to contend with a very difficult 
parliament for the Socialists, with a People's Party in the 
middle of a political offensive, which has made the house the 
center of its activity to oust the PSOE from power. 
  Almunia's debut will be tomorrow, Wednesday [11 May], in the 
Congress plenary session at which Gonzalez will have to explain 
the escape of former Civil Guard Director General Luis Roldan. 
On that day, Almunia will already have the difficult task of 
weathering the storm, which will undoubtedly worsen with the 
speech by People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar. 
  The new Socialist group chairman will also have to bear the 
brunt of the parliamentary negotiations with the Catalan and 
Basque nationalists, very complex negotiations which will be 
even more so following the 6 June [date as published] European 
and Andalusian autonomous community elections. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Rosa Paz report: "Almunia Elected Spokesman With Support </F>
of Almost 70 Percent of His Group"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Joaquin Almunia was elected chairman 
and spokesman of the Socialist group in parliament yesterday 
with the support of over 67 percent of the PSOE [Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party] deputies and the Guerraists' blank 
votes. The secret ballot produced a result of 91 votes in 
favor, 42 blank, and one against. 25 deputies were absent from 
the meeting, including several members of the government and 
Felipe Gonzalez himself, and the three replacements in the seats 
of Carlos Solchaga, Jose Luis Corcuera, and Baltasar Garzon, who 
did not regularize their status as members of parliament until 
yesterday afternoon. Alfonso Guerra did not attend, either. 
  This result, in which the Guerraists did not reach 33 
percent 
of the vote, is quite different from that recorded at Carlos 
Solchaga's election as spokesman 10 months ago, when the former 
economy minister's candidacy won 89 votes against the 66 of 
Guerraist Eduardo Martin Toval. This fact means that Guerraism 
has lost almost 11 percent of its support in the Socialist group 
in parliament during the past year. 
  Afterward, Almunia played down the poll's significance and 
stated that he would not have minded if voting had also taken 
place at Monday's Executive Committee meeting, at which Guerra 
advised seeking a candidate who would attract greater consensus. 
However, government sources deemed it "especially undesirable" 
to force a vote at this time of grave political crisis.

<F P=106> [Jesus Duva report: "Garzon: `Gonzalez Used Me as a Pawn'"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Former Secretary of State for the 
National Plan on Drugs, Baltasar Garzon, yesterday confessed to 
feeling betrayed by Felipe Gonzalez, who he accused of viewing 
his recruitment as an "electoral stratagem." "When, a year ago, 
I decided to join the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] 
electoral list as an independent, I did so absolutely convinced 
that I could contribute to the task of regenerating Spanish 
politics," he explained. "Perhaps that was my first mistake. 
Many people said that I was being used to present an image -- 
that of the struggle against corruption; and now I must largely 
agree that they were right," he added. Garzon, who confirmed 
that he is also giving up his seat as a deputy, harshly attacked 
the government and reiterated his conviction that he had been 
used as "a pawn." 
  Garzon, who will return to the National High Court, 
expressed 
regret that Gonzalez used him by announcing that he would give 
him the chairmanship of a committee to investigate corruption. 
He said that his "ambition" was fulfilled with his post in the 
struggle against drugs, and that he was "comfortable" at the 
Interior Ministry during Antoni Asuncion's term. 
  "The proliferation of corruption scandals and the prime 
minister's passive attitude, with the consequent tension in 
society, which I believe is justified, caused me to consider the 
need to resign and not to be a party, even through omission or 
silence, to that situation," the former number two at the 
Interior Ministry stated. He sent a letter to Gonzalez 18 
April, telling him that unless corruption was tackled thoroughly 
-- and not through "mere posturing" -- he would resign before 25 
April. 
  The 38-year-old judge demanded of the prime minister that 
the 
change of attitude which he was demanding be made clear in the 
19 April state of the nation debate. Gonzalez asked him to wait 
to talk with him after the debate, and this took place at the 
Moncloa Palace on 22 April. The head of government asked him 
for time to adopt measures and for his cooperation against 
corruption. "Neither before nor after did he use it, or give me 
the means to carry it out," the judge asserted. 
  In the state of the nation debate, Garzon was disappointed 
with respect to the committee on the Filesa affair, and clashed 
harshly with his parliamentary group and with Justice Minister 
Juan Alberto Belloch. He said of the latter's conduct that it 
has left him with "a very bitter and disappointing, albeit 
expected, taste." 
<H5>  Second Letter to Gonzalez </H5>
  In a second letter to the head of government, dated 25 
April, 
the judge accepted the latter's request for cooperation. "That 
was my second mistake. Since I resigned later, people have 
pettily and maliciously sought to infer that my resignation was 
due to other reasons." 
  Garzon complained that he was not consulted about the merger 
of the Interior and Justice Ministries, which he opposed when he 
spoke with Gonzalez on 4 May, and the latter explained this plan 
to him "in passing." "This lack of consideration for what I 
might think and the fact that I was dispensed with in the 
struggle against corruption made me see that I was being counted 
on for nothing; that I had lost the prime minister's confidence 
for that task and that he did not trust me." 
  The former deputy showed himself especially pained by new 
Justice and Interior Minister Juan Alberto Belloch's way of 
dispensing with him from the outset: "This precipitated my 
resignation and its being tendered immediately, in view of the 
obvious invitation to do so. There remained no reason for 
postponing a resignation which I had announced 20 days earlier. 
All they wanted was to to gain time in order to find a solution 
which would end my presence in the government," he added. 
  The judge asserted that he would not have given up his seat 
if he had only had a confrontation with the minister or felt 
"disappointed" at not being a minister. "I have resigned 
because I believe that I do not have the prime minister's 
confidence. Therefore I cannot continue to support from my seat 
the government or its prime minister, who has preferred to 
dispense with me," he explained. 
  Garzon expressed his confidence that his relationship with 
the government from his position as a judge will be "good," and 
that the government will cooperate with him in the eradication 
of corruption. 
  Much of the statement by the former secretary of state for 
the National Plan on Drugs was devoted to corruption, against 
which, according to him, "firm and surgical measures," which he 
has not seen so far, are necessary. He described as 
"short-term" the measures adopted by the government, and 
emphasized that a single case of corruption can bring down a 
government. 
  "I am convinced," he stated at another point, "that an 
attempt will be made to combat corruption, but they do not wish 
to count on me. With respect to political responsibilities, 
some have yet to come. So it should be. For instance, the 
resignation of the state attorney general occurs to me." 
Garzon, who suspects that he could have "some difficulties 
henceforth" in carrying through his ideas, showed himself in 
favor of Eligio Hernandez' replacement and of his successor's 
being given "greater guarantees of independence." 
<H5>  Government's Response </H5>
  Miguel Gil, secretary general for the government 
spokesperson, showed himself opposed to the former deputy's 
assertions that Felipe Gonzalez has a passive attitude to 
corruption. "The government is acting with determination, 
firmness, and vigor in the struggle against corruption, and is 
also backing up that determination with deeds, decisions, and 
practical measures," he said. 
  During his appearance, Garzon came out in favor of setting 
up 
specialized police units against corruption, coordinated by the 
Interior Ministry. According to him, the measures adopted by 
parliament, "although abundant," are no good for tackling the 
cases which have proliferated, and so "rapid, but investigatory, 
procedures should be established." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, May 13 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, in a bid to deflect mounting criticism of UN 
operations, said Friday [13 May] that UN member states were to 
blame for any confusion in the world body's action in 
international crises such as ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda. 
  "The UN is neutral and and carries out the decisions adopted 
by the 15 states (on the Security Council), which include the 
five superpowers," he said in an interview on French radio. 
  The UN chief was in the French capital to discuss the 
Bosnian 
crisis ahead of an international ministerial conference on the 
matter Friday in Geneva. 
  Paris earlier this week threatened to pull its forces out of 
Bosnia -- where they form the largest UN peacekeeping contingent 
-- if progress towards a negotiated settlement cannot be 
obtained. 
  The French warning came ahead of the meeting Friday in 
Geneva 
by foreign ministers from the United States, Russia and five 
European Union states including France and Britain to try to 
restart the Bosnian peace process. 
  Butrus-Ghali said the UN could only be "accused of 
subjectivity in the sense that it executes" Security Council 
decisions. 
  But he conceded that member states might get "tired" about 
military and financial demands if UN peace operations carry on 
endlessly. 
  When asked about the French threat of a force pull-out in 
Bosnia, Butrus-Ghali said it was up to the Security Council -- 
of which France is a permanent member -- to find replacements. 
  He noted the example of Somalia, where after the departure 
of 
U.S., German, Belgian and French forces, the UN operation was 
handled essentially by African and Asian troops. 
  "I have no way to prevent a member state from withdrawing 
its 
forces from a UN military operation," he said. 
  He also said he regretted huge outstanding financial 
commitments to the UN by member states, such as the United 
States which he said owes more than a billion dollars. 
  It was the United Nations' duty "to help member states 
either 
find peaceful solutions to conflicts, or to serve as an alibi 
for states that need the United Nations to excuse their lack of 
action." 
  He stressed the United Nations had been successful in recent 
years in El Salvador, Cambodia and South Africa. 
  Even in Yugoslavia, he said, the United Nations could claim 
some successes, such as aid supplied for some two million 
refugees and displaced people, heading off the spread of trouble 
to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM] with a UN deployment and, up to now, having kept the war 
inside ex-Yugoslav borders.

  [Text] Vienna, May 12 (AFP) -- A team of inspectors from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will head to North 
Korea Saturday [14 May] to inspect nuclear sites, the Agency's 
spokesman David Kyd said Thursday. 
  Kyd said the inspectors would travel as planned Saturday 
unless the Agency learned by then that Pyongyang had gone ahead 
with the replacement of fuel rods in a disputed reactor at 
Yongbyon. 
  According to the South Korean [as received] news agency 
YONHAP, Pyongyang agreed to an IAEA request to postpone the 
replacement of the fuel rods until the arrival of the inspectors 
but added that it could not delay the replacement any longer 
than that date. 
  "We can't delay the replacement of the spent fuel rods 
forever for security reasons," Kim Chong-su, the assistant to 
the North Korean ambassador to the UN, told YONHAP. "We have to 
replace the rods because we have reached the red mark which if 
you're driving in a car means you're out of oil." 
  An IAEA team was denied access to the five megawatt reactor 
at Yongbyon in March in order to collect samples of some of the 
spent fuel to determine whether any of it was diverted for 
military purposes. 
  Kyd said that the upcoming trip would last eight days 
although it could be extended if deemed necessary. 
  He said that although the inspectors would not be allowed to 
accomplish their full mission "they will be able to do most of 
their work, which is satisfactory for us." 
  He added that there were no plans for the inspectors to do 
any work on the five megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, a plant which 
the United States suspects of being used to produce nuclear 
weapons. 
  The IAEA has invited experts from North Korea to Vienna for 
talks on narrowing differences over the controversial 
replacement of the rods, but so far Pyongyang has not responded 
to the offer, Kyd said.

<F P=106> [Victor Smart report: "Europe's Big Yes to the Union But No </F>
to a Federal Future"] 
  [Text] Voters retain a widespread faith in the European 
Union [EU] but resolutely oppose the idea that its destiny lies 
in becoming a federal United States of Europe, an exclusive 
pan-European opinion survey for The European reveals. 
  Only 18 percent of Europe's 255 million citizens would vote 
in a referendum to quit the Union, the poll shows. Yet 49 
percent of voters oppose "a United States of Europe with a 
federal government." Just 32 percent are in favour, and there 
are substantial majorities against federalism in eight of the 12 
EU member countries. 
  The result of the far-reaching poll, conducted by MORI 
[Market and Opinion Research International], will come as a 
significant boost to the clutch of parties fighting next month's 
European Parliament elections on an anti-Maastricht ticket. 
  Until recently, the vision of a federal Europe has been an 
article of faith among main-stream politicians across much of 
the continent. Now, eight months after ratification of the 
Maastricht Treaty, the findings suggest that the public is in a 
more questioning frame of mind. 
  According to the poll, across the 12 EU states 70 percent of 
people would vote to maintain membership of the Union. Even in 
Britain, the home of Euro-scepticism, only just over one-third 
of voters would back withdrawal. 
  But, according to MORI, the appeal of full-blooded 
federalism 
is now confined to Greece, Italy and Belgium -- the latter 
itself a federal country, where backing is highest at 58 percent. 
  In Spain, traditionally viewed as one of the most ardently 
European nations, opinion is almost evenly split. 
  In France and Germany, in spite of their leaders' unswerving 
commitment to the Maastricht blueprint for EU integration, the 
electorates are also firmly resistant. 
  In Germany, supporters of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's avowd aim 
to build a United States of Europe are outnumbered almost three 
to one. 
  Predictably, some of the most ferocious opposition comes 
from 
sovereignty-conscious Denmark and Britain. In both countries 
around 70 percent of voters are hostile to federalism. But more 
significant as a trend may be the high level of opposition in 
the Netherlands, one of the founder-members of the then EEC, 
which has traditionally looked to Brussels to fight the corner 
of small countries. According to the survey, only 21 percent of 
the Dutch support a United States of Europe, compared with 73 
percent against. 
  With the Germans about to begin a bold new federal 
initiative 
when they assume the EU presidency at the beginning of July, the 
findings are bound to be used as ammunition in the increasingly 
bitter battle over Europe's institutional future. Rows are 
already erupting over the agenda for the Inter-governmental 
Conference (IGC) in 1996, which is expected to quicken the pace 
of federalism. 
  Although anti-federalist politicians are still in a 
minority, 
the poll shows that their views have the support of a 
surprisingly large proportion of the population. It will be a 
further warning to political elites of the dangers of a 
high-handed approach to European issues. 
  Federalists will already be uneasily aware that the 
political 
landscape of Europe is changing. Antonio Martino, the new 
Italian foreign minister in the Berlusconi government, and a 
founder-member of the anti-federalist Bruges Group, is expected 
to take a cooler approach to European integration than his 
predecessors did. In a crucial policy shift, he is set to 
assert Italian national interests at the expense of ceding 
further powers to Brussels. 
  The political partnership between Chancellor Kohl and 
Spain's 
prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, could be abruptly terminated. 
Gonzalez is under increasing pressure to resign as a result of 
growing corruption scandals in Spain. The right-wing opposition 
leader, Jose Maria Aznar, who may well succeed him, is less 
fervent and idealistic about Europe. 
  For this ambitious Europe-wide survey, MORI and associate 
pollsters in the 12 EU nations interviewed 7,300 adults over 18 
years old, undertaking the fieldwork between 10 and 30 April. 
  In terms of the future political make-up of the European 
Parliament, the poll puts the Socialists and the Centre-Right 
European People's Party level-pegging on 34 percent. The 
European People's Party is an umbrella grouping of Christian 
Democrats, the British Conservatives, the French UDF and 
Gauliists, and possibly the new right-wing Italian groupings. 
  This neck-and-neck voting result would make the Socialists 
the biggest single party, owing to the character of European 
electoral systems. The Left would emerge with roughly 40 seats 
more than the European People's Party, yet would lack an overall 
majority. The final political line-up will ultimately hinge on 
how right-wing parties align themselves after the June election.

<F P=106> [Victor Smart article: "Will Maverick Right Hold the </F>
Balance of Power"] 
  [Text] The complexion of the next European Parliament [EP] 
is likely to be determined by the unpredictable new parties of 
the Right, such as Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia. 
  This is the picture that emerges from THE EUROPEAN/MORI 
survey on voting intentions across Europe. 
  Campaigning for next month's European elections has begun in 
earnest with the traditional parties struggling to win over 
voters. According to the poll's projections, the most 
spectacular loser from the political mainstream could be the 
junior partner in the German government, the centrist FDP [Free 
Democratic Party]. With just 2 percent of the vote it would 
fail for the first time, under German law, to break through the 
threshold required to gain seats. On the survey's figures, 
Felipe Gonzalez's Spanish Socialists could also be severely 
mauled, with the Right winning its first national plebiscite 
since the death of Franco. Such an outcome may well prove the 
beginning of the end for the administration in Madrid. 
  More generally, however, the MORI poll reveals the extent to 
which none of the main parties has managed to establish any sort 
of lead. In fact, the Socialists and Christian 
Democrat-inclined European People's Party find themselves 
neck-and-neck on 34 percent, while the proportion of people 
saying that they are committed to vote is down eight points on 
the turnout on the last European elections in 1989. Meanwhile, 
the Greens are stuck on 9 percent and the Liberals on 7 percent. 
  This analysis highlights how pivotal the position of 
right-wing forces in Italy has become. None of the three 
coalition partners has yet committed itself to joining one of 
the nine specific European Parliament groups, but overtures to 
them will now become intense. 
  According to the poll, Forza Italia would emerge with 26 
seats, the neofascist National Alliance with 13 and the Northern 
League with eight. If that 47-seat bloc joined the Christian 
Democrats en masse, as we are projecting in our analysis, the 
centre-right grouping should find itself with only 40 or so 
fewer seats than the more ideologically cohesive Socialists. 
But there is an equal likelihood that the three Italian 
groupings will peel off, with Forza Italia joining the 
Democratic Alliance, the National Alliance the Technical Right, 
and the Northern League the regionalist Rainbow group. 
  Though it would still not help the Socialists to an overall 
majority, that internal fragmentation of the Right would give 
the Left a commanding lead of nearly 90 seats. Even the 
prospect of such a blow will force the European People's Party 
to consider postelection concessions to the Italian Right. 
  Forza Italia is likely to prove far less passionately 
pro-European than previous governments in Rome, some observers 
doubting whether it will support the Maastricht Treaty. Yet the 
survey reveals that Italian rank highest on almost all indices 
measuring commitment to the union. 
  Their projected turnout is the highest of the states: the 
number who would vote in a referendum to stay in the Union has

<F P=106> [Ian Verchere article: "UK Under Pressure To Rejoin </F>
Military Project"] 
  [Text] Britain has been told by France, Germany, Italy and 
Spain that it must rejoin a $7 billion project to build a 
European military transport aircraft by the end of this year. 
If not, it will be excluded from a major European defence 
programme -- dubbed Euroflag -- expected to secure 37,500 
aerospace jobs and generate sales of $55 billion. 
  The demand comes as Deutsche Aerospace, Aerospatiale of 
France, British Aerospace [BAe], Italy's Alenia and Spain's Casa 
[Dasa] prepare to challenge U.S. domination of the world market 
for military transport planes by building a European 
alternative. The so-called Future Large Aircraft is designed to 
meet the needs of the Western European Union [WEU] defence 
forces and enter into service by the year 2002. 
  WEU air forces have total requirements for 300 Euroflag 
aircraft in the transport and tanker roles. Euroflag also hopes 
to win additional contracts for another 300 copies from 
non-European air forces. 
  Despite early support for the Euroflag project, the British 
Government withdrew in 1989 and assumed "observer status" within 
the European partnership as its Ministry of Defence and Air 
Force considered a cheaper offer from Lockheed to refurbish its 
existing fleet of 61 U.S.-built Hercules C-130 transports and 
eventually to replace them with an upgraded C-130J variant. 
  Other members of the consortium say that a British decision 
in favour of the Lockheed offer would be anti-European and give 
U.S. manufacturers continued domination of the European market. 
"Lockheed hopes to kill off the Euroflag," said a British 
Aerospace spokesman, "and continue to monopolise the military 
large aircraft market in Europe and worldwide." 
  Britain's fleet of C-130s dates from the 1960's and is now 
suffering from "a number of corrosion, fatigue and age-related 
problems," according to a recent parliamentary defence committee 
document. 
  BAe this week launched a campaign to persuade UK legislators 
that support for the $7 billion development phase of Euroflag is 
vital if Britain is to avoid repeating its disastrous decision 
in 1969 not to join the Airbus Industrie consortium at its 
inception. Although BAe subsequently sought membership, it has 
ended up as a minor player in Europe's most successful aerospace 
venture to date and forfeited billions of dollars in lost work 
as a consequence. 
  The Euroflag consortium which also includes Belgium, 
Portugal 
and Turkey as associate members -- plans to develop a 
four-engined aircraft capable of transporting up to 25 tonnes of 
military hardware and personnel over ranges up to 3,700 
kilometres. 
  It will have 2.5 times the airlift capability of the 
U.S.-built Hercules C-130J and, says a Dasa spokesman, is 
designed for the rapid deployment of forces. 
  Growing pressure from member governments to reduce the 
project's development and productions costs has prompted a 
recent decision to make the Euroflag a turboprop rather than a 
jet-powered aircraft. 
  Euroflag plans to run the programme within the framework of 
Airbus Industrie "in a professional and commercial fashion," 
explained an industry insider. This will involve the creation 
of a special Airbus subsidiary and will be the first time it has 
been able to accommodate the Italian aerospace sector through 
the involvement of Alenia. Each of the partners will have a 20 
percent stake and share of the work schedule. 
  Through this structure, Euroflag hopes to allay fears in 
Germany and Britain that the programme will experience the usual 
budget over-runs associated with cost-plus defence contracts. 
According to a Dasa spokesman, Bonn does not expect to face the 
same level of opposition as that experienced over the 
Eurofighter which has been consistently attacked as a Cold War 
weapon system. 
  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur last week urged WEU 
governments to throw their weight behind the Euroflag programme. 
"I invite our main partners to develop this European aircraft 
with us," he said in a pointed reference to British vacillation. 
  The project was, he said, "a bearer of hope for common 
European defence."

<F P=106> [Report by Laurence Peter] </F>
  [Text] Larnaca, Cyprus, May 13 (AFP)--Foreign evacuees air 
lifted from Sanaa by the British Royal Air Force Thursday [12 
May] said people were deserting the capital of war-torn Yemen 
and shortages were worsening. 
  Two RAF Hercules transport planes airlifted 148 foreigners, 
most of them British, to Cyprus from Sanaa. The evacuees, many 
looking exhausted, included babies and young children. 
  They spent about two hours at Larnaca airport before 
boarding 
a British Airways DC-10 plane bound for Gatwick airport, south 
of London. 
  Some had witnessed the fighting which erupted a week ago 
between northern and southern forces and were in Sanaa when a 
Scud missile slammed into a densely-populated area of the city 
Wednesday, causing at least 53 casualties. 
  Seventy-five evacuees arrived on one Hercules C-130 and 73 
on 
the other. The planes had flown into Sanaa from Djibouti 
earlier Thursday. 
  The group included about 20 Americans, as well as some 
Dutch, 
New Zealanders, Swiss and Hungarians. 
  British construction worker Michael Wild said the blast from 
the Scud missile which hit Sanaa Wednesday shattered windows in 
the hotel where he was staying, 1,000 metres (yards) from the 
impact. 
  He quoted local Yemenis as saying 43 people were killed and 
10 injured in the attack, which flattened eight houses. Many of 
the victims were children. 
  The official news agency SABA' said Wednesday 25 civilians 
were killed by the Scud, fired by southern forces, and President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih put the overall casualty toll at 53. 
  Wild added that the southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) 
building in the capital had been devastated in a northern attack 
and the Italian embassy was also hit. 
  A Hungarian neurosurgeon who asked to be not named said 
"medical supplies are extremely low" at the main Al-Thawrah 
public hospital in Sanaa, where he had been working. 
  He said the operating theatres in the 500-bed hospital were 
barely functioning and virtually all the hospital's foreign 
staff -- mostly Bulgarians and Indians -- had left. 
  About 10 Jordanian doctors arrived at the hospital a few 
days 
ago. 
  The surgeon said some 15 Somali refugees caught in the 
crossfire were admitted with serious bullet wounds, and "at 
least two of them died later." 
  The hospital was hit by electricity cuts and there was 
virtually no maintenance, he said. 
  One of the Hercules pilots, Flight Lieutenant Nick Young, 
said communications at Sanaa airport were "excellent" and 
praised the help offered by the Yemeni authorities. 
  He said he saw no damage to the airport, despite reported 
bombing raids by southern jets when the conflict erupted last 
week. 
  The evacuees were only allowed to bring out a maximum of 20 
kilogrammes (44 pounds) of luggage per person. 
  Yvonna Rienens, a Dutch teacher who was at an international 
school just outside Sanaa, said 150 of the 200 teachers and 
pupils at the school had already left. 
  She said she saw many Yemenis leaving Sanaa for villages 
outside the capital, some with their goats, and carrying only a 
few personal belongings, such as mattresses. 
  Oil engineers who were working for the U.S. company Yemen 
Hunt Oil in the Ma'rib field east of Sanaa said about 200 oil 
workers had stayed behind to keep operations at the field 
running. It produces up to 60,000 barrels of oil per day. 
  Some of them said Sanaa appeared to be a "ghost town," with 
many shops closed and long queues at petrol stations. 
  Veronica Pickton, a British tourist from Basingstoke in 
southern England, said there were frequent electricity and water 
shortages at the hotel in Sanaa where she had been staying for a 
week. However, there were "no signs of panic" among local 
residents. 
  More than 4,000 foreigners have now fled the country since 
fighting erupted. 
  Britain earlier organised an evacuation of 225 non-Britons 
from Sanaa. 
  Around 800 Britons, mostly oil workers, lived in Yemen 
before 
the civil war started. Some who were based around Aden, the 
southern capital, have already been evacuated by sea.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F>
unidentified correspondent -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] On the telephone we have Federal 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Good morning. 
  [Kinkel] Good morning. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, to begin with, a topical 
development. Yesterday evening the German ambassador in London, 
Hartmann, was summoned by Agriculture Minister Shephard, who 
evidently protested at the possible plans of the Federal 
Government to act unilaterally on the question of BSE [Bovine 
Spongiform Encephalitis -- Mad Cow Disease] and possibly 
introduce import restrictions on British beef. This is not an 
entirely normal event. What is your assessment of it? 
  [Kinkel] Well, to begin with, this is a subject that 
particularly interests us, and we have of course said that if no 
agreed policy can be found in Europe, we must in certain 
circumstances reserve the right to our own course of action. And 
I am assuming that that remains the position. I must now -- I 
have heard about the summoning -- but my position is that I must 
first know precisely what the subject of the discussion was and 
then we will deal with it. 
  [Correspondent] Do you see in this development a strain on 
German-British relations in view of the fact that British 
Agriculture Minister Shephard threatened -- to give one 
quotation -- very serious consequences? 
  [Kinkel] No, I do not see any strain. We should not 
immediately put such things in the category of strained 
relations. It is in a lower category, let us wait and see. It 
is an important subject; we shall discuss it and settle it 
calmly and quietly. 
  [Correspondent] Minister, you will soon be beginning a 
meeting at the Petersberg in Bonn with Russian President Yeltsin 
on the third day of his German visit. What is on your agenda 
today? 
  [Kinkel] [Passage omitted] Of course, the visit and the 
talks 
have shown we have deepened and strengthened our relations of 
friendship and partnership with our great neighbor. We are both 
economically and politically very important partners for each 
other; (?a factor there) is the personal chemistry between the 
chancellor and the president. [passage omitted] We are 
supporting Russia, particularly in its admission to the Council 
of Europe and the G-7 problems. Russia is naturally also 
placing its hopes especially on our support for a cooperation 
agreement with the European Union [EU] when we take over the 
presidency of the council on 1 July. 
  But we have also achieved a number of particular results. It 
is now clear how the dignified withdrawal of the Russian troops 
will take place here. Above all, we have been preparing the 
meeting today in Geneva of the five on the Yugoslav question, 
and we have, of course, also discussed intensively -- which is 
of great importance to the Russian side and to us -- the 
Partnership for Peace, the problem of creating a new security 
architecture for Europe. 
  [Correspondent] What would you say is the most important 
result of this Yeltsin visit? 
  [Kinkel] [Passage omitted] I am, of course, also pleased 
that 
we have been able to have intensive discussions about the NATO 
problem and the Partnership for Peace, since that, I believe 
[word indistinct] is the crucial subject for the Russian side 
and is of course of very considerable importance to us too. 
  [Correspondent] Some of the press comment today expresses 
regret that the Yeltsin visit has basically produced few 
concrete results. [passage omitted] 
  [Kinkel] [Passage omitted] The criticism that we have 
achieved few concrete results is mistaken. [passage omitted] We 
have also, for example, discussed other subjects that on their 
face are not so crucial but are still very important. For 
instance, we were able to explain the enlargement of the EU to 
take in the Central and East European countries, decided last 
Monday [9 May] in Luxembourg, which is also important for the 
Russian side. We have talked intensively about relations with 
the Baltic states. It is now clear that Mr. Kozyrev will come 
to the forthcoming Baltic Sea conference in Tallinn. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] You will be meeting your Russian counterpart 
Kozyrev again today, this time in Geneva at, as you have 
mentioned, a meeting of the foreign ministers of the United 
States, Russia, France, Great Britain, and the EU troika on the 
Bosnian conflict. This meeting is taking place against the 
background of the new developments in Washington, where the U.S. 
Senate has expressed itself in favor of lifting the arms embargo 
against Bosnia- Herzegovina. What is Bonn's position? 
  [Kinkel] When I was in Washington recently this very 
discussion was taking place on the Hill, and the expectation was 
that the result would be what it now is. It does not bind the 
executive. As far as lifting the embargo is concerned, of the 
12 Europeans the Dutch and the Germans have always been on the 
American side, or at least very close to it. The other 10 
countries, in particular those with troops on the ground, are 
against lifting such an arms embargo. I have just been speaking 
with Douglas Hurd and Alain Juppe: The British and the French 
in particular are against it, and I understand that, because 
they are concerned for their troops on the ground and are 
concerned that the fighting will only get worse. Aside from 
that, it would of course also be relatively difficult now, with 
a lifting of the arms embargo, to get arms into the enclosed 
areas. 
  But as I said, we are with the American position. It is just 
that I do not think it will come to lifting the embargo. For 
that we need the Security Council, and the Russians, the 
British, and the French will certainly be against it. 
  [Correspondent] Germany does after all supply weapons to 
governments that do not take human rights all that seriously -- 
like Turkey and Indonesia -- so why not the Government of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is fighting against the Serbs for its 
very survival? 
  [Kinkel] Yes, as far as the first subject goes, we must have 
more time for me to explain this a little, because of course I 
quite understand this. But I I will have to concentrate on the 
second question, for reasons of time. The issue is that there 
exists a resolution of the Security Council that simply does not 
permit it, and of course we are abiding by that, just as are the 
others. 
  [Correspondent] That was Federal Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel. Many thanks. 
  [Kinkel] Thank you.

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN)--The European Union (EU) intends to 
abolish most of the market barriers to Russian products as of 
1995. This was announced by Federal Economics Minister Guenther 
Rexrodt in a conversation with BERLINER ZEITUNG (Friday [13 May] 
edition). Rexrodt, who conducted negotiations with Russian 
counterpart Aleksandr Shokhin on the sidelines of the Yeltsin 
visit to Bonn, said that, with the exception of "a number of 
steel and textile products and the agricultural area," there 
will be "totally open markets." He, therefore, considers 
Moscow's complaints of blocked access to the markets as "not 
quite justified." 
  The economics minister called the agreement achieved on 
future deliveries of railway cars by Deutsche Waggonbau AG 
Ammendorf to Russia a "breakthrough." The impending catastrophe 
for the company in Halle has been averted. Rexrodt confirmed 
during the conversation that Moscow had offered MiG-29's to pay 
the debts owed to Germany. However, "we have rejected that. It 
does not fit with our military and research plans. At present, 
we are unable to agree to such a deal," the minister said.

<F P=106> [Article by Dorothea Siems: "Shelling Out--The Federal </F>
Government Uses Development Aid More To Boost Exports"] 
  [Text] The economics minister is still balking. "Tying 
development aid to large export orders," says Guenter Rexrodt, 
"is out of the question." Only a short time ago, he had 
"emphatically turned down" such petitions. But once again the 
liberal is fighting a losing battle: Industry has long since won 
out in Bonn. 
  Still this year, Bonn is introducing a new financing tool 
which gives priority to subsidized credits for large-scale 
infrastructure projects. The procedure of the so-called second 
window of development policy: The federally owned Reconstruction 
Loan Corporation (KfW) borrows money from the capital market 
and, together with development aid, hands it out as loans. Bonn 
guarantees 90 percent of the outside capital. With such mixed 
financing, conditions lie between those of usual development aid 
credits (a life of up to 40 years, with 0.75 percent interest) 
and commercial loans. 
  The new "mobility of the Federal Government" (BDI) [Federal 
Association of German Industry] is to give German industry 
better chances in the hotly contested markets in China, 
Southeast Asia, India, and Latin America. Especially 
advantageous: The new tool is also to benefit threshold 
countries no longer needing development aid, but which 
stubbornly insist on favorable financing in placing large orders. 
  Recently, enterprises had criticized repeatedly the 
governments of other countries, above all Japan and the United 
States, for providing much more support for their enterprises. 
Because of the "merciless competition," Babcock manager Hans 
Westphal demands that development aid be handled differently: 
What is needed are "more credits for a specific purpose" and 
"competitive financing packages." 
  With the new credit too, Bonn now follows the 
recommendations 
of enterprises--and at the same time violates an agreement among 
OECD member states. In 1991, after a tough struggle, they had 
agreed on a guideline for financing large projects in developing 
countries. The principal point: Commercial credits must not be 
mixed with Third World aid, and tying development money to 
export orders is inadmissible. At the time, the club of 
industrial countries thought they had averted a terrible 
"subsidy fight." Since then, the OECD has been setting 
"consensual interest rates" that are reexamined every six 
months. For China, for instance, the interest rate at present is 
6.75 percent. 
  In fact, however, it has been the Chinese who have recently 
tried to force better conditions. A further source of conflict 
are the differences in the national finance sectors which so far 
are not even covered in the OECD consensus. Japanese exporters, 
for example, can borrow money from their banks very favorably 
and long-term, and in France the state guarantees a large part 
of the financial risk. 
  Up to now, the Federal Government pursued the goal of also 
harmonizing these areas at the OECD level and preventing 
competitive subsidy races. Now, however, Germany is racing in 
precisely the opposite direction. 
  A model case already exists: Development Aid Minister 
Spranger contributes 352 million German marks [DM] so that a 
Siemens/AEG consortium may build a subway in the southern 
Chinese province of Canton. In this manner the Germans garnered 
orders worth about DM700 million. "Pushed through at that time 
as an exceptional case," thunders former development minister 
and SPD [Social Democratic Party] politician Erhard Eppler, 
"this method is now to become a system." 
  In view of "unemployment and recession in Germany," as 
Spranger defends the new economic policy component of his 
development policy, "export opportunities should not be missed." 
In this kind of development aid, the lion's share returns as an 
order for German enterprises. 
  No wonder that managers doing business with India also push 
"with great tenacity" (Rexrodt) for corresponding financial 
infusions from Bonn. A consortium consisting of Siemens, 
Deutsche Babcock, Takraf, and MAN Gutehoffnungshuette is at 
present negotiating with the Indian Government on a brown coal 
power plant with its own mine in South Indian Tamil Nadu. "Only 
the financing is not yet cleared up," according to Babcock 
manager Rainer Schumacher. It involves over DM2 billion, says 
the manager, "so Bonn should shell out something."

<F P=106> [Interview with Uta Wuerfel, FDP top candidate for the </F>
European Parliament elections, by Karl-Otto Sattler; place and 
date not given: "Without Tricks and Dodges"] 
  [Text] Without tricks and dodges Uta Wuerfel, the FDP 
(Free Democratic Party) top candidate for the European 
elections, enters the election campaign for the trip to the 
polls on 12 June. Should the FDP fail also in the Euroelections 
after the setbacks in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein this 
would mean the political ouster for the previous member of the 
Bundestag, who distinguished herself in Bonn particularly in the 
conflict over Section 218. In the Euroelections in 1989 the FDP 
barely survived with 5.4 percent. 
  [Sattler] In Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein the FDP 
slipped below 5 percent. In 1989 the German liberals reached 
only 5.4 percent in the European elections. Is the ouster 
imminent in the polls on 12 June as well? 
  [Wuerfel] We still have to make a great effort within the 
next few weeks until 12 June. We have to make clear to the 
citizens which policy the liberals plan to realize in the 
European Parliament. We have to illustrate the potential 
political loss if there were no longer any FDP delegates in the 
liberal caucus in Strasbourg. 
  [Sattler] Many citizens consider Euroelections as internal 
protest and teaching-them-a-lesson elections. Do you even have a 
chance in the election campaign to emphasize European policies? 
  [Wuerfel] Since January I have appeared at 70 events 
nationwide and I have found that interest is growing in European 
concerns. The European Parliament has far more jurisdiction than 
many citizens are aware of. For example, during my activity as 
Bonn delegate I came to realize: Every second sociopolitical law 
in Germany is based on an EU [European Union] guideline, and 
German parliamentarians were not involved in the latter's 
preparation. 
  [Sattler] Internally, the FDP is frequently elected in a 
certain coalition context--as a procurer of majorities or as a 
majority correction. However, in the Europarliament no 
government is elected. How does the FDP plan to justify its 
necessity beyond its small group of regular voters? 
  [Wuerfel] The rights of codetermination of the Strasbourg 
parliament, expanded after Maastricht, have absolutely concrete 
meaning to the citizens; the issues are the consequences of the 
domestic market, health protection, consumer protection, women's 
interests. In my view it is essential that liberal ideas have an 
effect on these issues via the European Parliament. We need 
energetic politicians who will prevent, for example, that the EU 
medicine act erects obstacles in Germany for natural remedies. 
  [Sattler] Where, in fact, lies the focus of the FDP 
Euroelection campaign in substance? 
  [Wuerfel] One thing is clear to us liberals: In view of the 
global competition Germany, the economic site, can only be 
secured at the European level. I consider issues of economic 
policy a priority in the election campaign. European policy must 
also be used to promote deregulation, debureaucratization, and 
privatization. Particularly as a sociopolitician I know: 
Whatever is distributed sociopolitically must first be worked 
for by a strong economy. Therefore our Europolicy serves to 
secure the site of Germany. 
  [Sattler] Foreign Minister Kinkel's role has been criticized 
in connection with German-French dissonances. Does this also 
damage Kinkel's role in the FDP Euroelection campaign? 
  [Wuerfel] I view as a great achievement Kinkel's negotiation 
skill and tenacity during the EU expansion negotiations with 
Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. Kinkel could not tolerate 
that the remarks of the French Ambassador Scheer damage the 
position of the Spanish foreign minister as well. Therefore 
Kinkel acted so forcefully, which is now being criticized by 
some. Parisian Foreign Minister Juppe and President Mitterrand 
have apologized for the behavior of their ambassador. The 
irritations between Bonn and Paris have been cleared. Even among 
friends it must be possible to call a spade a spade--without 
affecting the friendship. 
  [Sattler] On which target group is the FDP focusing in the 
Euroelection campaign? 
  [Wuerfel] In view of a growing mania for regulation I am 
committed to promote the freedom of decision for people. The 
bureaucratic constraint in many social spheres inhibits many 
achievement-oriented women and men; it must be stopped. I am 
addressing the achievement-elite starting with the skilled 
worker and on up, the people who want to act with direct 
responsibility and for whom solidarity comes before 
self-interest. 
  [Sattler] If the FDP should fail on 12 June: What happens to 
Uta Wuerfel? Then you won't come to Strasbourg, and you will not 
be represented in the Bundestag any longer. 
  [Wuerfel] I can only appeal to the citizens to enable me, 
through their vote, to support their interests in the European 
Parliament. For me it was a question of personal credibility to 
enter this election without tricks and dodges. My motive for the 
candidacy to the Strasbourg parliament was the realization that 
in the course of the European unification many decisions will be 
made bypassing the parliamentarians in Bonn. If the FDP should 
fail on 12 June I will no longer be able to make policy for the 
citizens.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Open Heart--The Liberals Have Had </F>
Their Fill of Him: Only Juergen Moellemann Thinks Himself 
Indispensable"] 
  [Text] Juergen Moellemann's office is draped as if he were 
the federal chancellor--so big is the German flag which the FDP 
politician has planted next to his desk. 
  In the tiny Bonn representative's cubicle the bombastic flag 
appears a sheer parody. It is out of all proportion--and that is 
why it suits Moellemann. 
  The FDP [Free Democratic Party] land chairman of North 
Rhine-Westphalia knows about the lofty effect of national 
symbols. But he does not know what a thin line separates the 
lofty from the ridiculous. 
  So it appears simply comical when he--after the 
embarrassingly close reelection at the Dortmund land party 
congress on the weekend before last--announces he will "decide" 
only in May whether he will be a candidate for the FDP presidium 
at the party congress in Rostock. 
  His opponents found it just as amusing that he--after the 
resignation of Education Minister Rainer Ortlieb--informed the 
German public that he had been asked, but was ready to assume 
the office only under certain conditions. "If he had taken it 
on," says an influential party caucus colleague, "he would have 
fallen on his face." 
  Even his mentor, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, was furious when 
Moellemann traveled across the country announcing that the FDP 
must proclaim its honorary chairman as presidential candidate. 
This is what Klaus Kinkel meant when he thundered at the 
Dortmund party congress that "there was too much chatter." 
  Moellemann was deeply wounded that the party chief dressed 
him down in public: "That was a demonstrative affront." He felt 
his offer of comradely cooperation had been meant seriously. 
Kinkel's threatening answer ("I shall take you at your word, Mr. 
Moellemann"), and the storm of applause caused by it, knocked 
for a loop the chairman of the FDP land association with the 
largest membership. "There he hit me with a straight right." 
  But Moellemann would not be Moellemann if he did not simply 
swallow the insult. No one has to explain to him how to turn big 
defeats into small gains. 
  An embarrassing ballot result? Are 59.6 percent not a 
majority? 
  His relations with Kinkel? If the party chairman declares 
important political decisions--such as the issue of the 
presidency or the coalition statement--to be an executive matter 
and takes them on himself, so be it. But then, in Moellemann's 
logic, he also has to suffer the consequences by himself. 
  Is it not true that he tried repeatedly to have personal 
talks with the chairman, to signal his willingness to cooperate? 
He had tried to gain access to him "with an open heart," but 
nothing had transpired except for a noncommittal "Mr. 
Moellemann, we need you." Still, he does not want to stay on a 
confrontational course: "We will just have to try again," he 
forces himself to say, "for the sake of the FDP." 
  Had he not warned them? Had he not made noises against the 
premature coalition announcement in order to avert danger to the 
FDP? Had not the parliamentary caucus chairman, Hermann Otto 
Solms--who called Moellemann's criticism "damaging to the 
party"--said the same thing on this subject, but without being 
reprimanded? 
  He did not miss what started to happen in Dortmund: "I don't 
sit on my ears." First came the letter by the parliamentary 
caucus chief, publicly calling for coalition discipline. Then he 
heard how General Secretary Werner of Cologne was being 
belabored to run as an opposing candidate. 
  On the Wednesday before the party congress, members of the 
Cologne bezirk committee talked for hours with Hoyer in the 
Ratskeller at Cologne's Alte Markt, to persuade him to run. But 
he did not want to. Kinkel had let him know that, although he 
had nothing against an opposing candidacy, he wanted to keep 
Hoyer as general secretary. 
  "If Werner had run," bets Cologne Liberal Walter Klein, "he 
would have been elected and Moellemann would be gone." 
  But it was not only the intrigues in the land association, 
not the "operative preparatory work," and not the blows by 
Chairman Kinkel which almost shot down the superliberal from 
Muenster. 
  He was punished because, even in the disguise of Cassandra, 
he was never seen as the friend concerned about the party's 
welfare, but rather as some well-known variant of Juergen 
Moellemann: the frustrated man who never got over the fact that 
Kinkel instead of him managed the rise to the top; the 
know-it-all who appears aggressively dogmatic even when he is 
right; the agile public relations leader whom one cannot take 
into one's confidence or tie him into it because he publicly 
talks about joint agreements for his own advantage. 
  It agitates him greatly that he has become dispensable in 
Bonn, within the coalition as well as in the party. And it is no 
consolation to him at all that he is experiencing personally 
what he has been predicting for his party in the fall election: 
That no one who does not maintain his profile is any longer 
important in Bonn. 
  The advice of a friend, to throw in the towel and use his 
talents for his own gain, has no effect on him whatsoever. To 
quit politics? "I cannot do that," says Juergen Moellemann, "for 
I have been associated with the club too long."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Cosmos Speaks--Rudolf Scharping </F>
Can Hardly Believe It: Helmut Schmidt Is Campaigning for Him"] 
  [Text] The "real satisfaction" of being honored, said the 
much-praised one, often remains concealed behind cliches and 
fulsome praise--namely the message "that others identify with 
our intentions and hopes." 
  This is how Helmut Schmidt formulated it almost 11 years ago 
in Berlin in a eulogy of Robert McNamara, former U.S. secretary 
of defense and later World Bank president. The anointed words at 
that time sounded like an obituary of himself, failed Chancellor 
Helmut Schmidt. 
  One year previously, in the fall of 1982, he had been 
toppled 
by Helmut Kohl. True, he still had an enormous lead in the West 
German popularity list of politicians. But he knew that the SPD 
[Social Democratic Party] under its chairman, Willy Brandt, 
would cause him grievous shame one month later at the Cologne 
party congress "going ballistic" and would shunt him into 
political exile once and for all. 
  Now Helmut Schmidt patently believes he has finally found 
someone younger who shares his intentions and hopes: Rudolf 
Scharping, 6 foot 4 inches tall, minister-president of 
Rhineland-Palatinate, SPD candidate for the chancellorship. 
Schmidt considers him capable of replacing [Schmidt's] 
successor, Helmut Kohl. 
  In mid-March, the SPD leadership met in Bonn's "Maritim" 
Hotel for a dinner honoring its former chancellor. The festive 
party was to belatedly celebrate Schmidt's 75th birthday--and 
was surprised by the guest of honor, for notorious SPD-panner 
Schmidt praised his party and its chief, Scharping. And the 
Hanseat forgot all arrogance and even referred by name to 
Palatinate Kohl. 
  "This man must be toppled," Schmidt twice drummed into the 
assembled group. The situation for a turnaround has arrived: 
"There is an SPD that can do it." And turning to Scharping, his 
neighbor at the table, he added: "And there is one who can do 
it." 
  Schmidt, in his unexpected role as campaign fighter, this 
week will present a book of over 200 pages (The Year of 
Decision) which was finished in March--political fast food, 
prepared for "the male and female voters of 1994." The Schmidt 
primer, aggressive, occasionally arrogant in tone, conservative 
in goals, is bursting on the scene in the midst of the SPD's 
program discussion. 
  In the "preface," Schmidt already expounds his judgment that 
in this superelection year, the voters will decide "whether we 
will sink even deeper into the morass of tactical political 
games--or rid ourselves of it": through electing a "different, a 
fresh Federal Government." 
  "This man," meaning Kohl, has "no concept for our economic 
future, no idea for our spiritual future; he can neither turn 
around the mass unemployment caused by him nor put an end to 
violent acts in Germany." 
  The chancellor only pulls his opponents "into the filth of 
his suspicions--that he knows how to do." If Weimar Republic 
conditions should occur and if democracy were harmed, 
then--according to Schmidt's harshest accusation--the chancellor 
is culpable: In February, he accused the Social Democrats of 
"treason against Germany's future," a slogan used in the Weimar 
democracy by the Communists against Social Democrats. 
  A "fresh force" is needed at the head of the state. Schmidt: 
"It offers itself in Rudolf Scharping. This is a man who has 
learned how to govern as the head of government in 
Rhineland-Palatinate and has shown there what he can do." 
  What a change: For years, Schmidt had tormented and nettled 
the comrades, mostly for fun and to the advantage of their 
political opponents. He was constantly quarreling with his party 
and its representatives. During election campaigns, he provided 
only sparse support for Johannes Rau or Hans-Jochen Vogel. 
Schmidt-Cosmos, as comrades named the know-it-all, with lectures 
and books raked in the big money which he, while still in 
political office, begrudged others. 
  Despite all that, or perhaps even because of maintaining 
such 
distance from his own camp, Helmut Schmidt remained a 
media-attractive political pensioner even after moving out of 
the office of chancellor. 
  Now the elder statesman--Scharping at first could hardly 
believe his good luck--just in time before the elections, is 
returning into the arms of his party. The last survivor of the 
legendary Wehner/Schmidt/Brandt triumvirate, in his old age 
might yet be elevated to the position of "grand old man" of the 
traditional party. 
  Schmidt evidently is impressed by Scharping's will to power 
which wants to place the SPD in the center of the voter 
spectrum. No fear of a common ground with the conservatives, but 
distance from the ecological and pacifist movements which have 
changed society and Social Democracy--the former chancellor 
likes that. How often had he complained about the "pack of 
swine" of Brandt's party. Now he feels belated gratification. 
  For the election in the fall, Schmidt would like to see 
strong people's parties, and not overly strong marginal 
parties--FDP [Free Democratic Party] and Alliance 90/Greens. He 
hopes that the extremist fringe parties will stay below 5 
percent. Whosoever, out of aversion to the large parties, seeks 
refuge with the extremists, increases "the probability of a 
grand coalition emerging in the end." He is not comfortable with 
that, but to him--and here he is more outspoken than his 
protege, Scharping--it is preferable to "rainbow coalitions, be 
they led by my own party or by the CDU [Christian Democratic 
Union]." 
  Schmidt is reappraising even his own ranks. Most striking is 
his differentiated judgment of Oskar Lafontaine. Since the 
latter's pronouncements on the secondary virtues of the 
then-chancellor 12 years ago, Schmidt had vilified and avoided 
him. But at the birthday party in the "Maritim," Schmidt had a 
long conversation with the Saarlander [Lafontaine]; he shares 
the latter's analyses of mistakes made in the rapid introduction 
of the currency union in the course of German unification. 
  With regard to "perceptiveness, eloquence, and capability of 
implementing plans"--all of them secondary virtues--the 
Saarlander resembles Franz Josef Strauss, who also "had not been 
a trained economist, yet still was a good finance minister." "In 
a similar way...one could imagine" Lafontaine "in the same 
office." 
  Once a chancellor, always a chancellor; to hand out grades, 
assign places, he enjoys doing that. But whether such assistance 
helps Scharping, or whether the wondrous discipline in his party 
will get lost when rebellious comrades will soon hold him 
responsible for Mr. Schmidt's dispensed wisdom, remains to be 
seen--at the latest, in the fall.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oskar Lafontaine, SPD deputy chairman and </F>
minister-president of the Saarland, by Helmut Loelhoeffel; place 
and date not given: "Those Who Do the Right Thing by the 
Environment Will Be Rewarded"] 
  [Text] [Loelhoeffel] Your name is synonymous with the 
social democratic concept of "ecological renewal of industrial 
society." The SPD's [Social Democratic Party of Germany] 
government program quite intentionally focuses on work, social 
security, and economics. Why is it that you allow the ecological 
component to be shortchanged? 
  [Lafontaine] Ecological modernization is a pivotal reform 
project as far as we are concerned. Work, social security, and 
ecological renewal are not contradictions by any means. We wish 
to combine work and the ecology and make it clear that 
ecological renewal will result in more jobs and that it is a 
social task our society must deal with, because intolerable 
ecological conditions cannot be permitted to exist from a social 
point of view. 
  [Loelhoeffel] But the Greens and the environmental groups 
are 
saying that the draft program does not contain very much solid 
language aside from some general declarations of intent. They 
doubt that the SPD is serious about new initiatives on the 
environment. There even are critical voices from inside the SPD 
itself. 
  [Lafontaine] From the point of view of the Greens I can 
understand that criticism. They are a political party in 
competition with us and they would like to cast doubt on our 
credibility on ecological issues. What is more, they do not want 
to come out as they did in the last Bundestag election when they 
failed to gain any seats. By now the voters have a very good 
idea of where the SPD stands on environmental issues. We already 
stated in the last Bundestag election campaign that an SPD 
government would take decisive steps aimed at ecological renewal 
which would be markedly different from the practices of the Kohl 
government. One of the central projects still is an ecological 
tax reform. 
  [Loelhoeffel] The draft program merely refers in general 
terms to an energy tax, however. Michael Mueller, the spokesman 
of the SPD parliamentary group, and others deplore the lack of a 
clear statement on higher mineral oil taxes for example. One 
cannot leave the transportation sector out of the equation. 
After all, it accounts for about 25 percent of energy 
consumption. 
  [Lafontaine] Unfortunately both the public and large 
segments 
of the political parties still do not understand what ecological 
tax reform is all about. It is not designed to provide funds for 
this or that project; it is not a way of making people pay more 
taxes but a way of setting new price signals. The principal idea 
behind this reform is to place less of a load on work and to 
raise taxes on the consumption of energy and materials harmful 
to the environment. This will create incentives to use less 
energy and to put new products on the market which conform to 
environmental standards. Those who do the right thing by the 
environment will be rewarded. Employees will have more money in 
their pockets because income taxes or other payroll deductions 
imposed by law will be cut. 
  [Loelhoeffel] Why put the blame on the public rather than 
admit weak points in selling the program? 
  [Lafontaine] I have seen 100 headlines which read "fuel 
taxes 
to rise." But I have not seen a single headline referring to the 
ecological tax reform which said "deep income tax cuts" or "cuts 
in payroll deductions." Not a one. The media almost always focus 
on the seemingly negative aspects, and those that are positive 
are suppressed. And that does harm to this important reform 
project. 
  [Loelhoeffel] But it is difficult to understand your 
project, 
if one cannot gauge its consequences. 
  [Lafontaine] The consequences are that there is less strain 
on the environment and that the working population is relieved 
of unnecessary burdens--and that creates more jobs. Employees 
get to keep more of what they earn and can decide on their own 
what they wish to spend and consume. That needs to be understood 
because we need to obtain the approval of the public for this 
ecological tax reform. Better environmental policy can only 
succeed and the proposed lessening of the strain on the 
environment can only be achieved if the majority of the voters 
is for it. Unfortunately a good many environmentalists fail to 
see the connection. Those who would like to see the price of one 
liter of gasoline raised to 5 marks [DM] may salve their 
conscience. They may even gain the support of a number of 
delegates to a party congress. But they make it impossible to 
win a majority of the voters over to their position. 
  [Loelhoeffel] Just the same, we would like to hear some real 
numbers. Who will have to pay how much when? 
  [Lafontaine] It would be both irresponsible and unwise from 
the point of view of economics to decide on scope and timing 
without taking the economic situation into account. For 
instance, the decisions reached would depend on whether the 
automobile industry were doing well or doing poorly. Many other 
factors would also play a role. That applies to all decisions 
which have economic and social consequences. 
  [Loelhoeffel] What other factors contribute to the SPD's 
credibility with regard to environmental protection? 
  [Lafontaine] The second important point in addition to 
ecological tax reform is that we believe the production of 
electric power from nuclear reactors is untenable and therefore 
wish gradually to relinquish that option. In talks I have had 
with the environmental groups I got the feeling that this 
particular demand for which many protest demonstrations were 
held over the years has been all but checked off because it has 
long since been included in all the wish lists. Real progress in 
the nuclear energy field alone provides an ecological 
justification for a change of government in Bonn. The third 
point I would like to mention is the restructuring of research 
policy which needs to be focused on the environment. We have to 
build a bridge into the solar age, i.e. all technologies which 
conserve energy, lessen the strain on the environment, and 
develop renewable forms of energy, including the use of solar 
and wind energy, must be supported in entirely different ways 
from now on. 
  [Loelhoeffel] The current version of the SPD government 
program puts the ecological tax reform off to the time "European 
Union [EU]-wide regulations" have been adopted. That sounds like 
procrastinating a solution and shifting responsibilities. What 
is it that the SPD can and will push through? 
  [Lafontaine] We have a first draft in hand. It goes without 
saying that we will not wait until every EU country has 
understood the need for ecological tax reforms. I am in full 
agreement with Rudolf Scharping on that point. Let me remind you 
of the debate on the catalytic converter and lead-free gasoline. 
If we had waited then until all the EC countries availed 
themselves of that technology, it would have been introduced on 
a Europewide scale at a much later date. We took the lead and 
the result was that the technology spread all over Europe. As a 
consequence, new jobs were created here in Germany as well. 
  [Loelhoeffel] Is there a need to change, clarify or augment 
other passages of the ecology segment of the present draft? Do 
you yourself think more forceful language is needed? 
  [Lafontaine] There is a debate on speed limits. The present 
draft states that we must have speed limits that are 
ecologically suitable and contextually meaningful. There is a 
specific reference to the need for a 30-kilometer speed limit in 
residential areas. Independent of the debate on speed limits as 
such our principal aim is to make progress on the introduction 
of new environmental technologies. The most important item on 
the agenda are automobiles that conserve gas by using two to 
three liters per 100 kilometers. 
  [Loelhoeffel] Are you giving any thought to dictating fuel 
consumption limits to the automobile industry? Or how else do 
you propose to bring about the development of more efficient and 
ecologically friendly engines? 
  [Lafontaine] I am opposed to more regulations, and that goes 
for the ecology as well. The main thing is to cut down on energy 
consumption. That, after all, is the political goal. The 
political establishment should exercise restraint with regard to 
setting exact technical standards on specific environmental 
targets. That should be left to the technicians and to 
competition. That is why I am in favor of restricting ourselves 
to achieving the goal of lower consumption. And that is where 
the price signal comes in which we are putting up with the 
ecological tax reform.

<F P=106> [Article by Inge Guenther: "`Now We'll Have To Fight Our Way </F>
Through Here on Foot'"] 
  [Text] The men are all doing their best. The driver at the 
steering wheel, keeping a look-out to all sides; the bodyguard 
near the street map, his eyes fixed onto the center of 
Strassfurth. Except that it is not all that easy to get around 
in the heart of the old salt town in the Harz thanks to numerous 
one-way streets and detours. Given such an inconvenient 
situation, protocol is reduced to naught and improvisation is 
everything. "Mr. Minister-President, now we will have to fight 
our way through here on foot!" The employee's index finger 
outlines the linear distance. 
  At the other end of the market place the Infomobile of the 
Saxony-Anhalt government is in readiness with coffee, cake, and 
various printed material for information-starved citizens and a 
head of government who, in turn, will be agreeable to 
discussions. A sea of vending booths is taking up space in 
between, surrounded by a throng of people looking for bargains. 
First you have to work your way through this crowd. The 
minister-president accomplishes this with the ease of a 
housewife used to shopping here every week. An elderly gentleman 
greets somewhat hesitantly, most do not recognize the man in the 
grey-green smock at all. Christoph Bergner, his hair always 
slightly out of place, his smile more timid than beaming, does 
not fit the general image of a Christian-Democratic head of 
government. 
  And personally that suits him fine. It is "difficult" at 
times, he has been known to confide to journalists, "to be 
constantly in the public eye" and to be exposed to "people's 
expectation to say something extraordinary." A facet of a 
politician's life that to him represents the "actual stress of 
his office." From a political standpoint this cannot suit him. 
On the scale of known eastern German heads of government, 
Bergner brings up the rear. His minimal time in office--six 
months from his appointment in December of last year until the 
new elections on 26 June--is not even enough time to build up a 
presentable foundation of popularity. Also, following numerous 
affairs and the fall of no less than two party-supplied 
minister-presidents in but one legislative period (Gerd Gies 
because of MfS [former GDR] Ministry of State Security, 
nicknamed Stasi] intrigues and Werner Muench because of salary 
augmentation) the CDU (Christian Democratic Union) government 
party in Saxony-Anhalt is politically bankrupt. From 39 percent 
of votes in 1990 down to a mere 20 percent according to polls, 
such figures illustrate the shrinkage process. It is nice to 
know that someone like Christoph Bergner still feels a "general 
liking" for a condition according to which "political offices 
are not forever." 
  And so he is a modest man, "his feet planted firmly on the 
ground," and he seems to have integrity. He takes the train 
every day from his hometown Halle to the land capital and feels 
it is all right though strenuous that "there is a group of 
commuters," all the way to the land DGB (German Trade Union 
Federation) boss or the superintendent, who for the brief 
discussion of their concerns prefer the train route to official 
channels. 
  Bergner considers privileges rather a nuisance. He never 
wanted to be anything special, not even in the GDR which, 
according to self-assessment, he "tolerated patiently but 
without self-exposure." One of his most significant insights 
from that time: "Anyone who wishes to remain blameless in this 
system must be prepared to abandon a career." Bergner found his 
niche as employee at the Halle institute of biochemistry for 
plants. Keeping quiet like that can also generate depressions. 
Bergner talks about these in his autobiography, identifying them 
as the motive for signing the "New Forum's" call for 
organization, still prohibited in 1989. "This was not a 
calculated political action but rather a desperate act." 
Nevertheless one "that ultimately led me into the landtag." 
  Once there, Bergner soon became CDU caucus boss and thus the 
antagonist of Reinhard Hoeppner who is at the helm of the Social 
Democrats in the landtag. Competing with one another has 
therefore been familiar to them for quite some time. And when 
Bergner comments that a "personified election campaign is 
absolutely not to his liking" this is not based on a lack of ego 
but on the fact that Hoeppner is almost something like his alter 
ego. In other words: Viewed from a certain distance the 
political as well as exterior contours of the two opponents do 
not provide much of a difference. A difficult choice for the 
average person from Saxony-Anhalt who is really only desiring 
decent conditions in Magdeburg and secure jobs. 
  It would have been different with the heavyweight western 
import Werner Muench: Hoeppner as "David" against "big boss 
Goliath." One who knows the little people against one whom they 
did not like that much but who in their opinion knows the 
important people in Bonn. The land, which seems somewhat 
arbitrarily patched together from the poor Altmark in the north, 
part of the Harz, the chemical triangle of Buna, Leuna, 
Bitterfeld, the Magdeburger Boerde (a fertile plain), and the 
outskirts of Wittenberg, not only lacks money but also identity 
and self-worth. Only "a local" can convey this. 
  At the time, Christian Democrat Bergner was justified in 
"recognizing with a certain concern" that Muench represented a 
"dream opponent" for Social Democrat Hoeppner. Not surprisingly, 
his predecessor toppled over the salary affair "because the 
emotional sounding board was present"--within the citizenry and 
within the party. What a blessing in disguise: With Christoph 
Bergner as the new top man the CDU, coming out of its free fall, 
at least reached solid ground. Once there and asked what 
distinguishes him from Hoeppner, Bergner can only think of this 
response: "We are both very much representatives of our 
parties," in so far there are "admittedly some differences where 
the programs are concerned." Exaggerating this means: In 
Saxony-Anhalt the minister-president copies the image of his 
challenger. Therefore one's own political lines are not so much 
evident in the respective personality but instead in the tangle 
of relationships with party friends. A dilemma for Bergner: His 
attempt to embody the moral new beginning has very narrow 
bounds. Given that at the same time he advocates the 
continuation of the spent conservative-liberal coalition of 
Magdeburg. "Continuity" was the political "slogan" he announced 
in the government declaration in January. There is not much else 
he can do within the short time but to promote the half-finished 
bills of the Muench cabinet, pass the budget, and keep the 
rather elaborate government operation running. 
  The 46-year-old family man actually gives the appearance of 
being indulgent in this task. For example, only after the 
persistent appeal of his finance minister did he agree to 
reclaim the excess salaries paid to the fired ministers. Bergner 
still feels a certain loyalty toward his predecessor, Muench, 
and the need for a "fair portrayal of his performance." This is 
also how he justifies that no less than three days before his 
fall he was still supporting Muench. "As caucus chairman, I 
could not bring myself to demand his resignation." 
  He preferred to bear the consequences from the salary affair 
himself--a distinctly protestant characteristic. His 
announcement that he did not want to earn more money as 
minister-president than as head of the opposition was meant 
sincerely though naive given the situation of the law. It is 
said that he now reduces his salary through regular donations. 
And in spite of this sensitivity for the emotionally charged 
subject Bergner appears convinced "that the salary affair was 
not all that far-reaching." During his travels through the 
country he found "that it really does not echo at all." 
  Anyway, the high school students, with whom he has 
discussions this morning in Halberstadt, are more interested in 
the subject of unemployment, criminality, and the "power" of the 
media. "There is no dirty business in this country that has any 
chance of remaining undiscovered," Bergner declares as if he 
owed a certain recognition to an opponent. This is followed 
promptly by his "but." "Politicians must confront elections, yet 
in Hamburg's editorial chambers there is no control mechanism." 
He is saying what he thinks. He talks about "folk play actors," 
as politicians are being portrayed in television, and about the 
"cold sweat" into which he himself still breaks out in front of 
a camera. He admits freely that when asked about youth policies 
he "waffled a bit." And they like him. An honest soul, as if he 
had no other choice--"in the time remaining when at least I 
still have responsibility."

<F P=106> [Editorial by Martin S. Lambeck: "Success for Yeltsin"] </F>
  [Text] Helmut Kohl has helped his Russian friend Boris 
Yeltsin achieve a great and visible success during his state 
visit. Moscow will certainly acknowledge the outcome of this 
visit with satisfaction: The Germans are no longer insisting on 
a ceremony in Weimar. The Russian troops will be seen off in 
Berlin for the whole of 31 August -- with a celebration such as 
the one staged to say farewell to the Western allies in Berlin 
yesterday. 
  On an international level, the chancellor has committed 
himself to helping Moscow. Germany wants to bring about Russian 
membership in the European Council, although some criticism has 
already been voiced by that organization. Furthermore, Germany 
wants Russia to be included as a major economic nation. Whether 
the other partners will agree to the G-7 being extended to G-8 
remains to be seen. 
  Yeltsin made hardly any concessions: No decision has been 
made on a German consulate in Kaliningrad; no success has been 
achieved in the tiresome matter of returning German cultural 
assets. The only field where positive signals came from 
Yeltsin's side was NATO's Partnership for Peace program. 
  Kohl's success during this visit is of an atmospheric 
nature. 
The cordial embraces he shared with Yeltsin indicate the 
closeness of relations between the key European powers, Germany 
and Russia. This basis can be used for working on unsolved 
problems.

  [Text] The 11 French people of Premiere Urgence who have 
been detained by the Bosnian Serbs for more than a month now 
could be released within the next few hours. Their imminent 
release was announced by the Serbs this morning and confirmed 
later by the European negotiator, Lord Owen. French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe, who is in Washington, has confirmed this 
information to Philippe Reltien: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] I would like to take this 
opportunity 
to say a word about the 11 hostages. According to news that has 
reached me from Paris, and also from Belgrade or Sarajevo, a 
possible release of the hostages could take place within the 
next few hours. I am still very cautious on this matter because 
I have no confirmation. I would like to recall -- to deny 
certain reports circulated in France -- that since the 
hostage-taking in early April, not a single day has passed 
without our diplomats deploying their efforts in Belgrade, Pale, 
Sarajevo, at the United Nations, the Greek presidency, and our 
allies. We have ceaselessly applied pressure, explaining 
clearly to the Serbs that we will not accept a mockery of 
justice, that this was a hostage-taking, that there was 
manipulation, that we will not bargain, and that we want the 
release of all the hostages. If the news were to be 
confirmed--I repeat that I am cautious--this will be the result 
of this continuous and efficient diplomatic effort. [end

  [Text] From Washington, where he is currently paying an 
official visit, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has once 
again stressed the need for economic aid to Algeria. Mr. Juppe 
also issued a warning about what could happen in the event of 
the fundamentalists coming to power. Alain Juppe: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] I have said very clearly that the 
advent of an extremist, fundamentalist, anti-European, and 
anti-Western government in Algiers will have very serious 
consequences, not just for Algeria itself, and for France, but 
for the whole of the Mediterranean region, and thus for the 
equilibrium of this region. The Americans will evidently be 
directly affected. So, what can one do to prevent this 
happening? One can promote dialogue --the current Algerian 
authorities are devoting themselves to doing this, and it is not 
easy, of course--and above all, and this is no doubt the card 
that we must play, one can help Algeria pull itself out of the 
economic slump, the economic crisis, from which it is suffering 
after 30 years of socialist management. It has done what had to 
be done with the International Monetary Fund and devalued its 
currency, it has taken courageous internal measures; it now has 
to follow this up. This means an extensive rescheduling of the 
debt, and also bilateral or multilateral aid to the Algerian 
economy. France is making a great effort to this effect, the 
Twelve have agreed to make a great effort, and I hope that 
others will also join us in this action. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article signed D. Dh.: "Celso Amorim's Visit in France: </F>
Brazilian Foreign Minister Wants His Country To Become a Member 
of the Security Council"] 
  [Text] Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, on an 
official visit in Paris from 6 to 8 May, argued that "expansion" 
of the UN Security Council [UNSC] should not be limited to 
"northern developed countries" such as Germany and Japan. 
  Mr. Amorim felt that Brasilia's wish was well received in 
Paris. France now recognizes that the Germans and the Japanese 
must one day be given a permanent seat. Would it therefore not 
be time to take in the world's 11th economic power on behalf of 
the developing countries in the southern hemisphere? 
  [French Foreign Minister] Juppe turned a willing ear to Mr. 
Amorim's arguments. It may be that Paris is only trying to 
delay as much as possible the inevitable expansion process by 
increasing the number of candidates, thus making the process 
more complex. 
  Paris believes that while permanent member status confers a 
number of rights as well as increased international prestige, it 
also implies "duties." One such "duty" is obviously to take 
part in peacekeeping operations whenever possible. To begin 
with, the two "natural" candidates (Germany and Japan) must meet 
certain criteria, including constitutional ones. Nevertheless, 
France believes that including a major Third World country would 
make for a more balanced council. What remains to be done then 
is selecting the lucky one. Other northern and southern "major 
developing countries" have applied for membership as well.

<F P=106> [Interview with Environment Minister Michel Barnier by </F>
Jerome Strazzulla; place and date not given: "Michel Barnier: 
`Our Culture of Nuclear Safety'" --first paragraph is LE FIGARO 
introduction] 
  [Text] On the eighth anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, 
the upsurge of nuclear safety problems in eastern Europe, the 
"long march" to Paris by opponents to the Superphenix [fast 
breeder reactor], and a national debate on energy initiated by 
the government for the first time in 10 years: Spring looks 
like it will be dominated by the atom. Environment Minister 
Michel Barnier explained the government's policy and its 
prospects in the area of nuclear energy. 
  [Strazzulla] You are the environment minister of the world's 
most nuclearized country. Do you get comments from your 
counterparts, especially the European ones? 
  [Barnier] At no time within the Council of Environment 
Ministers of the European Union [EU] has France's policy been 
called into question in front of me. Every country has chosen 
its strategy; we are not the only country which opted for 
nuclear energy, even though in France it covers 75 percent of 
our electricity requirments. 
  I think that other countries know our culture of nuclear 
safety, the rigorousness of our inspections, and the quality of 
our companies. This does not stop us from talking about it. 
  Whatever the atom's share in energy production, we have all 
experienced common problems: especially with safety, 
electricity lines, and nuclear waste. 
  [Strazzulla] As far as the choice of energy is concerned, 
what kind of maneuvering room does the environment minister have? 
  [Barnier] The environment minister assumes a special 
responsibility which he shares with the minister of industry: 
nuclear safety. This is an issue to which I am personally 
committed. The government is working in a coherent manner. 
  In the end, we ask ourselves the same questions, albeit with 
different approaches. The most important signal, an initiative 
by the prime minister, can be found in his desire to see an 
open, national discussion on energy and the environment. 
  I have the feeling that this debate will raise greater 
interest among local and national operators than we might 
expect. Within the government, I feel quite easy saying, for 
example, that in France we must revive diversification in energy 
production and move toward hydroelectricity, renewable energy, 
and biofuels, among other things. 
  [Strazzulla] Should we expect major changes in the national 
energy policy following this debate? 
  [Barnier] There is no use in beating about the bush; our 
electronuclear strategy will not change. However, what might 
emerge from this debate is a greater understanding and a better 
control over this choice. It should also help revive energy 
conservation, which we inexcusably dismantled 10 years ago. I 
would add a concern to this, namely a concern for greater 
openness and greater control over energy policy by parliament. 
  This is why I raised the idea of a law on nuclear safety. 
Lastly, this debate is linked to the law on regional 
reorganization and decentralization, especially as far as 
transport policy and the balance between road and rail transport 
are concerned. 
  [Strazzulla] The alleged greenhouse effect is the new 
argument used by the nuclear lobby. Does this seem credible to 
you? 
  [Barnier] The current debate between scientists is focused 
more on the seriousness of the greenhouse effect than on its 
existence. In addition, I am organizing the third "Segur Talks" 
on this topic on 16 May. While waiting to know the truth, we 
have to apply the principle of caution. It is essential to 
limit greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide. 
  From this point of view, nuclear energy is actually a clean 
energy. However, it raises other problems, the most serious of 
which is waste. 
  [Strazzulla] The West seems to want to mobilize to help 
Ukraine decommission its plant in Chernobyl. What are the main 
options considered? 
  [Barnier] The shutdown of the two most dangerous reactors in 
Chernobyl is something desired by both the West and Ukraine. 
The prime minister asked us to prepare a specific initiative to 
bring about this shutdown, in cooperation with the other 
countries of the European Union and the G-7. 
  This point will be one of the main elements in the Naples 
summit. Apart from the reactors, a new sarcophagus has to be 
built in Chernobyl and there are still the major problems of 
radioactive waste and water protection. 
  In order to meet Ukraine's energy needs, we could bring two 
or three new reactors on line. That would assume a new culture 
of nuclear safety in that country, as well as exceptional 
support from all the Western countries. Lastly, in all the new 
democracies, there is an enormous amount of energy waste. 
Helping them better manage their networks and resources is a 
big part of the solution to their problems. 
  [Strazzulla] After 40 years of operation, the problem of 
nuclear waste has emerged in France. What do you think of it? 
  [Barnier] I believe that the operators and the bodies in 
charge of nuclear energy have demonstrated a lack of foresight 
by putting this issue off until later. Yet, very few political 
decisions affect future generations to the same extent as the 
production of long-life nuclear waste lasting 10,000 years or 
more. The issue was finally raised -- rightly -- in the late 
eighties. 
  The beginning of a solution was provided by the law of 1991 
and the work of the Bataille mission concerning the 
establishment of underground laboratories for studying deep 
storage. 
  [Strazzulla] From the point of view of lack of foresight, 
can 
we dissociate nuclear waste from other industrial waste? 
  [Barnier] All industries produce waste. In the past, 
industrial waste was often stored or buried in any manner and 
anywhere. It is true that the industries which produced this 
waste had no more foresight than the nuclear industry. 
  One of my first actions upon entering government was to 
launch an in-depth inquiry in each department in order to draw 
up a comprehensive and prioritized list of polluted sites. Once 
this list is drawn up, we will have to find the resources to 
treat these sites. I do not want anything to do with a 
"contaminated earth" case. 
  Nuclear energy also produces end waste. It must be made 
quite clear that no matter what type of reprocessing is used, we 
must have underground storage sites for long-life radioactive 
waste. 
  As for the processing of slightly radioactive waste, this 
process must be more stringently managed. 
  [Strazzulla] Nuclear physicists assure us that the waste 
problem will not be resolved with an incinerator. So what were 
the government's real motivations in deciding to reactivate the 
Superphenix reactor? 
  [Barnier] Superphenix will not be built to destroy all the 
waste produced by France's 57 nuclear reactors. 
  The prime minister made a basic decision, namely to stop 
fast-breeding operations in Creys-Malville in two years' time, 
in other words, to stop producing plutonium. 
  The facility will make it possible to carry out experiments 
aimed at gaining better knowledge of the means of reducing the 
volume of the most dangerous nuclear waste. 
  I therefore have some trouble understanding the attitude of 
certain ecologists vis-a-vis Superphenix at this time. 
  Bearing in mind the mass of money, research, and expertise 
invested in this site, it would have been inconceivable to write 
it off. This decision is in line with general interest.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New Caledonia -- Edouard Balladur </F>
Meets With Neaoutyne"] 
  [Text] The prime minister yesterday met with Paul 
Neaoutyne, president of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation 
Front (FLNKS -- separatist), with whom he discussed the 
territory's future. At the end of this meeting, Mr. Neaoutyne, 
who decided not to participate in the follow-up committee on the 
Matignon agreement last year, discussed with Mr. Balladur the 
"FLNKS' desire to see the partnership" between the [French] 
state and the [overseas] territory "returning to something 
concrete." "The prime minister," Mr. Neaoutyne added, "said 
that the government's position was to pursue" the action taken 
and make sure that "the state plays its role in ensuring that 
the partnership initiated is maintained so that over the next 
four years the discussions go beyond the current disputes and 
disagreements, so that choices are freely made in the 1995 and 
1998 elections." 
  The FLNKS president also emphasized the "disagreements" 
which 
exist in the sphere of air transport and nickel. 
<H5>  Return to Calm </H5>
  In this connection, he reaffirmed that his party wanted air 
transport to be opened up to competition to bring to the 
territory a clientele likely to "revive tourism." 
  On the subject of nickel, which recently sparked off 
disturbances in Noumea, he reaffirmed his demand for "raising 
the nickel quota on over a renewable annual period so as to 
enable the mining companies to regain market shares compared 
with Indonesia and Malaysia." Calm has been restored on the 
spot, with the "truckers" having agreed to withdraw their 
vehicles from the southern province following the agreement to 
take account of their demands. 
  Max Foucher, president of the trucker's trade union said, 
"there are no winners or losers, but we are still vigilant." 
  Reason has prevailed following 18 days of a conflict marked 
by the plundering of the area surrounding the Southern Province 
Administrative Headquarters and the High Commission. A 
timetable has been drawn up for an emergency procedure. As of 
this week, several meetings will be held to prepare the work of 
the standing commission which is responsible for deciding on the 
proposals which will be submitted to the Congress.

<F P=106> [Report by Alexandra Schwartzbrod: "Cruise Missile: </F>
Aerospatiale Opens the Door to Matra"] 
  [Text] Nice -- The president of Aerospatiale, who intends 
to settle his proposed alliance with his partner Deutsche 
Aerospace [DASA] in missiles and satellites by the end of the 
year, is ready to envisage a division of labor with Matra on the 
future cruise missile which is included in [Defense Minister] 
Leotard's military programming law. 
  The only major new program included in the 1995-2000 
military 
programming law, the famous "French cruise missile," for the 
time being known as the "APTGD" [long-range precision weapon], 
will not spark off a fratricidal war between Aerospatiale and 
Matra, the two manufacturers currently competing for it. 
Aerospatiale President Louis Gallois promised in Nice on 
Saturday [7 May] that: "We welcome the launch of the APTGD 
missile. It is likely that the two manufacturers concerned will 
be interested in this program. If Matra's Apache missile is 
chosen, there will be no problem (Aerospatiale has a share of a 
little over 40 percent in this program); if the Defense Ministry 
prefers Aerospatiale's ramjet solution, Matra will want to 
participate in it...and the question of a division will then be 
raised." 
  Indeed, neither of the two French missile manufacturers can 
afford to be excluded from this deal, which represents 200 
missiles for the domestic market alone and, in view of the new 
threats, should raise strong demand on foreign markets. The two 
proposals, which are equal in cost, are estimated at around 2 
billion francs [Fr], including development and provision of 
missiles, whereas Fr1.4 billion has been allocated for this 
program over the period 1995-2000 of the programming law. A 
decision by the Defense Ministry in favor of Aerospatiale's ASMP 
[medium-range air-to-surface]-C missile or Matra's Super-Apache 
is expected in the next few months. 
  Although he regrets that all the programs involving 
Aerospatiale have been delayed or have seen their orders cut, 
Louis Gallois, whose mandate is due for renewal next June, says 
he has a "positive judgment" on the military program drawn up by 
Francois Leotard. "The plan exists and we think that it is 
politically binding on its authors," the Aerospatiale president 
said, welcoming the .5-percent annual growth rate for equipment 
funding, and especially the continuation of all the scheduled 
programs. (His group has had to accept the sudden halting of 
four major projects in four years, the S-45, Hades, and ANS 
missiles in the military sphere, and the Hermes space shuttle in 
the civilian sphere.) Louis Gallois can only applaud the launch 
of the Helios-2 military observation satellite, the decision by 
the public authorities to maintain ballistic and ramjet 
competence, and the pledge on the FLA [Future Large Aircraft] 
transport plane. He thinks that the launch of the latter is now 
possible even if London does not order it and if British 
industry does not participate in its production. 
<H5>  Pivotal Position in Europe </H5>
  "We share the objective of reducing the cost of programs 
because this is also necessary for us to be able to export, but 
it presupposes an effort by manufacturers, the DGA [General 
Delegation of Armaments], and the general staffs," Louis Gallois 
also explained. "The DGA's parameters, which are substantial, 
must be placed on the table, like ours." While specifying that 
the military programming law "must not be used to maintain 
outdated industrial structures," the Aerospatiale president 
thinks that the French firms are in a pivotal position in the 
reorganization of the sector in Europe thanks to the Leotard 
plan. 
  This is an advantage which comes at the right time because 
Louis Gallois is currently negotiating two proposed alliances 
with its German partner DASA in missiles and satellites. "It 
should be possible to settle these projects before the end of 
the year," he said, expressing the view that "we must aim at 
something resembling a balance between the partners." However, 
"these alliances are not ends in themselves, they are not 
closed," the Aerospatiale president added, explaining that it 
will be necessary to think quickly about a possible 
rapprochement between the two Matra-BAe [British Aerospace] and 
Aerospatiale-DASA tandems in missiles and an opening of the 
Aerospatiale-DASA alliance to the French company Alcatel in the 
satellite sphere. With regard to military activities, it will 
then be necessary "to go and seek alliances in the United 
States."

  [Excerpts] The Paris-London air dispute continues. The 
British Government said today that it gives its full backing to 
the British airlines which have decided to fly into Orly. 
[passage omitted] French Transport Minister Bernard Bosson said 
today that he finds it absolutely extraordinary that British 
Airways should try to force the hand of the French authorities. 
He was speaking to Alain Pagon: 
  [Begin Bosson recording] We are in favor of competition, but 
we want it to be disciplined, loyal and healthy: We are not in 
favor of an economic jungle. The government took some simple 
decisions last October: It decided to open the Orly-London 
route this April; it decided the opening of the Orly-Marseille 
route to one company only in April 1995, and the opening of 
Orly-Toulouse to one company only in April 1996. The 
government's decisions will be respected. We have a certain 
delay on the opening of the Orly-London route. It is a matter 
of weeks now. We are moving toward that opening which we 
ourselves decided, but we will not accept any forcible action by 
whatever company on Monday [16 May] or on any other day. 
  As concerns the Orly-Marseille and Orly-Toulouse routes, the 
European Commission has ordered us to open up these two routes 
within six months. We do not agree with the Commission's aims, 
because we feel that our measures are in conformity with 
commitments made in Brussels by previous French governments, and 
we have therefore appealed to the courts. It is all extremely 
simple. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report signed "M. La.": "Suspicion That Boeing May Launch </F>
Own Project Prompts Airbus To Continue Studies on High-Capacity 
Airliner"] 
  [Text] The Europeans and the Americans mistrust each other 
with respect to their high-capacity aircraft project. As a 
result, in the coming weeks Airbus Industries will start the 
second study phase of its own project, referred to as A3XX, 
without interrupting the joint feasibility studies it has been 
conducting with Boeing. This announcement was made by 
Aerospatiale Aircraft Division Director Claude Terrazzoni on 
Saturday, 7 May. Participants in this program are the world's 
three largest aircraft manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus, and 
McDonnell Douglas): None of them intends to risk being left 
behind. 
  For the time being, the A3XX project is at a very 
preliminary 
stage, that of feasibility studies. According to Aerospatiale, 
the market, which is primarily located in Southeast Asia, could 
require annual production rates of 60 aircraft by 2010 and 
remain roughly at this level until 2020. The French 
manufacturer fears that the joint work it has been doing with 
Boeing might turn out to be "no more than a smoke screen," 
according to Claude Terrazzoni. Two months ago, the 
announcement that cooperation would continue had been received 
with some skepticism by Airbus Industries, which felt 
uncomfortably constrained. 
  Today, the French worry that the Americans might launch 
their 
own high-capacity aircraft based on Boeing's 747-400. They 
believe Boeing's recent announcement of a longer-range, 
stretched version of the new twin-engined 777 confirms such a 
theory. This aircraft "would be a direct competitor to the 
existing four-engine 747-400," Mr. Terrazzoni said. "Therefore 
Boeing would have no choice but to put out new versions of the 
747-400 and study a new wing unit for a bigger machine." With 
an estimated price tag of $220 million (Fr1.25 billion), the 
French are determined not to miss this market. For the time 
being, however, only two airlines (British Airways and Singapore 
Airlines) have shown interest for an airliner able to carry over 
500 passengers.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jean-Marie Colombani: "The World Is </F>
Changing, Mr. President!"] 
  [Text] We know that cohabitation can be a valuable arm 
serving the country: the fortuitous conclusion of the GATT 
talks; the outcome of the monetary crisis at the end of 1993; 
and the brief glimpse of firmness that lifted the siege of 
Sarajevo at the start of 1994. However, leaving aside those 
crises, what have we gained? Surely it is time to question the 
status quo in foreign policy caused by this fragile role-sharing 
at the top, and France's relative immobility at a time when, on 
the contrary, everything is moving and changing around us. 
Here, as in other areas, we must be careful not to sweep the 
coming months under the carpet as if they were merely an 
interlude. Looking beyond cohabitation and the internal 
squabbling in the majority, we should above all ask ourselves 
whether the "Gaullist-Mitterrandism," that serves as the basis 
for our foreign policy, is still pertinent. 
  France's foreign policy consists of a series of layers, it 
is 
a doctrine which grew through accumulation (de Gaulle, Giscard, 
and then Mitterrand), forming a hybrid whole. The reality on 
which it was founded is now being shaken. The global view that 
was dear to General de Gaulle, and European policy as defined by 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and further elaborated by Francois 
Mitterrand, are now showing signs of exhaustion. The loss of 
stability of the African Financial Community [CFA] franc, the 
birth of a major African power (South Africa), the progressive 
resolving of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the collapse of the 
FLN's [National Liberation Front] Algeria, and the collapse of 
Arab secularism clearly illustrate the disappearance of the old 
reality that governed Gaullist policy. 
  With NATO playing an increasingly international role and 
with 
the start of the Partnership for Peace with Russia, our concept 
of independence with regard to deterrence must be questioned. 
It should also be admitted that the United States is incapable 
of organizing large-scale operations for the West all by itself. 
  Lastly, the enlargement of the European Union [EU] and the 
probable shift in its center of gravity, together with the 
hitches in Franco-German relations merely throw into doubt 
European policy since 1974. These are all reasons to justify 
the fact that, just as it is up to the presidential candidates 
to redefine a social pact for French society, they will also 
have to establish a veritable foreign policy pact. 
  The elections of 1981 and, even more so, 1988 were ballots 
for continuity in foreign policy. The election of 1995 will 
have to mark a break, assuming everyone is aware of the need for 
modernization. 
<H5>  1. What Borders for Europe? </H5>
  Given that the EU is, as the president of the Republic likes 
to remind us, tracing the frontier of our destiny, it would be 
useful to know whether this border will stretch as far as 
Vladivostok or if it will stop at Poland. Since shape often 
determines content, it would also be useful to know whether we 
are resigning ourselves to a "low-profile" Europe of 20 states, 
which would constitute a delayed but real triumph of the British 
goal of a vast free-trade area, or if a few countries convinced 
that future combat will be based on European identity can find a 
way of pulling the others along. 
  In any event, French policy was not to accept enlargement 
without deepening, that is without putting the institutions in 
order and clarifying the procedures governing the Union. The 
result is that we are now rewarded with enlargement without 
deepening! 
<H5>  2. Fate of the France-Germany Tandem </H5>
  This issue is related to the border question: Chancellor 
Kohl assures us that his country "will not accept its eastern 
borders being the EU's eastern borders." But where is the line 
of France's vital interests? 
  It is true that, officially, the twin motor is doing well. 
Both countries are still pulling the European bandwagon along; 
they are pushing for a structured and eventually political 
Europe, in line with the consensus uniting their elites; and 
monetary coordination survived the EMS [European Monetary 
System] explosion. However, the traumatism of 1990 has left its 
mark: Even if Francois Mitterrand can point to Mrs. Thatcher's 
memoirs to prove that France was not put out by German 
unification, Germany still formed the idea that the United 
States was a more reliable ally. 
  In any event, Germany has found a alternative policy in 
Central Europe, whereas France, denied a southern European 
alternative by the increasingly clear shift in Italian politics 
and the Spanish crisis, has to rely on the Franco-German 
connection working smoothly. At this stage, it would be better 
to follow the advice given by Jean-Francois Poncet, a convinced 
supporter of the German alliance: Take the initiative, voice 
your reserves, and revise the Franco-German treaty, given that 
France still has a major contribution to make in terms of 
defense. 
  Here again, the status quo can be prejudicial. The official 
logic that united both countries over the Maastricht Treaty is 
that of a Union moving forward in step. The implicit logic is 
that of a Union being hauled along by a Franco-German tandem, 
with a few countries joining in sooner or later. The current 
wave of Europessimism is imposing a minimalist view of a union 
marking time before splitting up. 
<H5>  3. Relations With the United States </H5>
  While isolationist pressure is resurgent across the Atlantic 
and while we remain convinced that British support is and will 
remain (unless the Labor Party wins the next elections) 
illusionary, then our problem is indeed how to keep the United 
States active in Europe. We must not therefore be afraid of 
seeing France strike an inhabitual pose, changing tack and 
chasing away the recurrent anti-American demons, even if 
"imperialism" remains embodied in trade and especially culture. 
Faced with an America which gives the impression of wanting to 
discard Europe through an uncertain policy, France must find the 
way of reconciling a European identity with a continued American 
presence. 
<H5>  4. Maintaining Peace in Europe </H5>
  Who keeps the peace and with what legal and military means? 
The door to peace, as the unfortunate Bosnians will tell you, 
is barely ajar. Official sources claim with one voice: "It is 
because of a lack of European unity, not the fault of Europe 
itself, and France is doing more than anyone!" Maybe, but this 
was not and is not enough to stop the Serbs or to make them 
understand that they could not go on behaving the same way 
indefinitely, i.e. until they have founded a "Greater Serbia." 
It is certainly not enough to impose the EU's point of view. 
  In a context where the defense forces of small countries are 
in an impasse, and where a not insignificant share of German 
public opinion is attracted by pacifism, attention is focused on 
the European nuclear powers. Without doubt, in this area France 
has European ambitions (after all, the Charles de Gaulle 
[nuclear aircraft carrier] was described by the head of state as 
the jewel in the crown of a future European navy), and without 
doubt, Edouard Balladur's "Stability Pact" project represents 
the first stages of a global political response, but the concept 
of a joint defense force remains in limbo. In the meantime, 
what good is such an effort if it merely serves an immobile 
foreign policy? 
<H5>  5. Mediterranean Stakes </H5>
  Free of the lyrical portraits painted by the general [de 
Gaulle] who, from the speech in Phnom Penh to the "Quebec libre" 
speech compensated for the decline in French power with the 
birth of an independent policy, the "Gaullist-Mitterrandian" 
foreign policy looked toward the north and the west rather than 
the south and the east. Now we border directly onto the south, 
much more than we do onto the east. Depending on how you view 
things, this is a friendly frontier (Spain and Italy) or a 
threatening frontier (the Maghreb). The current risk of Italian 
instability under the weight of corruption and the same risk in 
the future for Spain, emphasizes the absence of a French vision 
of Europe which failed to stand on two legs -- the Franco-German 
duopoly and Mediterranean solidarity. The political instability 
in Algeria means we risk paying dearly for this lack of vision. 
  If we are to change foreign policy, we have to modify the 
consensus that supports it, but this is impossible in a period 
of cohabitation. We must therefore hope that through the 
presidential debate that is getting under way, France will adopt 
a policy in line with its principles, a policy that delivers 
what it promises. From this point of view, the Yugoslav 
failure, the cowardliness shown over Bosnia, and the trap that 
has ensnared our soldiers on the ground, where humanitarian 
efforts screen out the reality of war, and the cautious phrases 
putting the aggressors on a par with the aggressed, will mark 
the end of an era in foreign policy. The Bosnian drama invites 
us to move into the future and to drop the 
Gaullist-Mitterrandian illusions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Massimo D'Alema, deputy secretary of the </F>
Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, by Federico Orlando; place 
and date not given: "An Alarm Without Precedents" -- first two 
paragraphs are LA VOCE introduction] 
  [Text] "The exchange of letters between [President] 
Scalfaro and [Prime Minister-Designate] Berlusconi a few hours 
before the presentation of the government to the Quirinale 
[office of the president] is without precedent in Italy. The 
fact that the head of state has to call upon the prime 
minister-designate to abide by the cardinal principles of the 
Constitution of the Republic in itself highlights how acute the 
issue of democracy is in Italy." 
  This is how Massimo D'Alema, the conventional "number two" 
at 
Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters], addressed LA VOCE, which 
pressed for his judgement as the opposition. 
  [Orlando] Are you happy with the list of ministers? 
  [D'Alema] Of course. They are all servants of the old and 
new regimes. 
  [Orlando] And what about the method used to form the new 
government? 
  [D'Alema] This is a complete regression with respect to the 
retreat from party politics that began under the Ciampi 
government. Here we have replunged into the old private, party, 
and prevailing way of thinking. Unfortunately with the addition 
of more serious aspects. 
  [Orlando] Which serious aspects? 
  [D'Alema] Something that is almost congenial because of its 
coarse arrogance; something else that is very serious because of 
the deep mystery that surrounds it. 
  [Orlando] Let us proceed in steps: What is the serious 
matter that is almost congenial? 
  [D'Alema] It is the rise of the audacious arrogance of a new 
political class from the hypocrisy of the old DC [Christian 
Democratic Party] regime that follows the same itinerary as the 
old but with the light-hearted impudence and ferocity of a 
neophyte. You can do anything for heaven's sake, but the idea of 
nominating your family attorney as justice minister is like 
having a monarchy, as royal absolutism was defined before the 
constitutional monarchy. 
  [Orlando] And the other matter, the serious and even 
mysterious one? 
  [D'Alema] I am referring to the appalling lack of openness 
during all these negotiations. There were turbid rather than 
mysterious elements onn both sides of the clash between 
Berlusconi and [Northern League Secretary] Bossi over the 
Viminale [Interior Ministry]. 
  [Orlando] Are you alluding to "the reasons that could not be 
reported" under which Berlusconi first refused the Viminale to 
the League? 
  [D'Alema] Certainly. Which are the reasons that cannot be 
reported and for which a League party member cannot go to the 
Viminale? And how is it possible that the League party member 
was later considered fit for the Viminale? Do the reasons that 
could not be reported no longer exist? Or do they remain and 
was it Berlusconi who had to yield after having been given no 
option by the League? However, this is not sufficient. What is 
just as serious and turbid is the reason the League used to 
justify its request to have the Viminale: It said that it 
wanted the Interior Ministry to guarantee a democratic 
government. In conclusion Bossi says to Berlusconi: "I want 
the Viminale because I do not trust your democratic loyalty"; 
and Berlusconi answers: "I cannot give it to you for reasons 
that I cannot even state in public." 
  [Orlando] And the head of state? 
  [D'Alema] The head of state is obliged to make continued 
calls for obeying rules that should apply to everybody. 
  [Orlando] In practice he is reminding that he is the one who 
nominates the ministers upon the proposal of the prime 
minister-designate. 
  [D'Alema] Yes, but I do not know what kind of equilibrium 
can 
be formed under these conditions. I only know that there is 
reason for concern. Can one imagine a government exposed to 
this type of influence at every crossroads? To blackmail? And 
how will it behave? Are we moving toward Europe or toward a 
world without rules? 
  [Orlando] Do you think that the lessons of the bribery 
scandals were not sufficient to induce all the old and new 
parties to respect the rules? 
  [D'Alema] But the rules are not only those that call for 
administrative honesty. Within a month we will be voting in the 
European elections, and our prime minister will be presenting 
himself as a candidate in all the Italian electoral 
constituencies. Can you imagine Major or Kohl presenting 
themselves to the British or German people knowing that they 
cannot go to Strasbourg? Berlusconi, the prime minister, cannot 
be a representative at Strasbourg. Or rather he can, but must 
resign as prime minister. Why is he campaigning himself then? 
He is misleading the voters, he is making improper use of his 
institutional role, he is showing contempt for the European 
institutions. He is campaigning for the sole purpose of 
channeling votes toward Forza Italia candidates by exploiting 
his own person and his own role. All this had never been seen 
before in Europe. 
  [Orlando] Perhaps these are the mistakes of the first steps. 
  [D'Alema] Let us speak clearly. If the infringements made to 
date are taken one by one, none of these are dramatic: neither 
the Fininvest-party management at Arcore [Berlusconi's 
residence], nor the family attorneys as candidates for the 
parliamentary speakerships, or as ministers, nor the exorbitant 
financial resources. But all together they can be one dramatic 
infringement. Let us take the resources: There is an enormous 
disproportion with respect to the other political alignments. 
The Center has even been reduced to silence. Forza Italia 
instead is everywhere, with posters on city walls and on 
Fininvest television stations. If an equal confrontation among 
the parties is not reconstructed, democracy will end. 
  [Orlando] I know that the Center does not have the 
resources. 
But Center and Left are both sleeping. Is the opposition sure 
that it is doing all its duty. 
  [D'Alema] We have our faults. We have not yet brought to the 
attention of the voters what the risks are in a new governing 
group that disdains the rules and is full of subversive ends. 
There is no doubt that the parliamentary opposition forces must 
stay close to the head of state in his role as a guarantor, 
otherwise he cannot do this alone. 
  [Orlando] Is the idea of a common opposition front 
reemerging? 
  [D'Alema] No, also because there are already people who are 
making the right moves. I must acknowledge the fact that Pact 
for Italy leader Mario Segni rigorously and energetically 
presented the problem of incompatibility between the public 
function that Berlusconi is getting ready to exercise and his 
private interests. But then it is a good thing that Center and 
Left are moving independently of each other, also to prevent the 
Right from moving into the Center. If the Right moves into the 
Center, the risks for democracy increase. 
  [Orlando] Will we finally have an opposition that is worthy 
of the fundamental role that it deserves in democracy? 
  [D'Alema] There is a fundamental new fact in the Italian 
political scene. Not only does the opposition, the great 
majority of the opposition, no longer refer to antisystem 
models, it is linked, with all its three great components -- 
Socialist, lay, Catholic -- to the democratic cultures of the 
West. We are members of the Socialist International, others of 
the Liberals, others of the Christian Democrats. The opposition 
parties will not be the ones to make Europe worry about Italy.

  [Text] The opposition parties are sharpening their weapons. 
The political coordination group of the Party of the Democratic 
Left is holding a meeting and will discuss the proposal of party 
secretary Achille Occhetto to extend a hand to the Center in 
order to form a stronger opposition. However, the signals 
coming from the Center toward the new government are discordant. 
Guido Dell'Acquila reports: 
  [Begin recording of Mario Segni, Pact for Italy leader] I 
thought [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi was going to chose an 
AC Milan-type soccer team, in other words, a team full of 
champions, a team capable of being an international force. 
Instead he has put together a team which is somewehere between 
the first and second division. [end recording] 
  [Dell'Acquila] Segni was using a soccer metaphor in order to 
explain his opposition to the newly formed government. However, 
in the galaxy that is the center of Italian politics, there are 
a multitude of differing opinions. For example, the former 
members of Mario Segni's Pact for Italy are trying to form a 
relationship with the Berlusconi government. 
  [Begin recording of Alberto Michelini, head of the Liberal 
Democrat Foundation] We must respect democratically the decision 
of the Italian people, of the electors. I believe that the 
government must be given a chance and so our opposition is one 
which does not have any prejudices. Our position will be 
determined by concrete facts. [end recording] 
  However, the largest centrist party is the Italian Popular 
Party [PPI], where the left led by Bindi and Mattarella is most 
definitely opposed to the government of Silvio Berlusconi, but 
where the emerging group led by Roberto Formigoni has a 
completely different stance. 
  [Begin Formigoni recording] If it were necessary, and if the 
government's program were acceptable, then I believe that some 
PPI senators -- in fact, I hope that party as a whole -- will 
abstain in the confidence vote in order to support the 
government so that it can get off the ground. Once this is over 
then there will be everything to play for. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Rosy Bindi, Veneto regional secretary of the </F>
Italian Popular Party, PPI, by Stefano De Martis; place and date 
not given: "Moderates, Get Back to the Center"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [De Martis] Your party 
companion Buttiglione thinks that an alliance with Forza Italia 
is possible in the next elections. Do you agree? 
  [Bindi] First, I refuse to consider [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi as being at the center of the system. We cannot go 
back to the Ptolemaic system that we overcame with the 
first-past-the-post electoral law. Nor can we determine what 
the political framework will be five years from now. In 
addition, our centrist position focuses not only the majority 
but also the left-wing opposition. Because if we were to 
finally have a modern Left not under the PDS' [Democratic Party 
of the Left] thumb, then it is likely that the right-wing 
grouping would change too, thus creating the conditions for the 
moderate electorate to return to the center. However, we cannot 
do this with somebody who deceived the moderates. 
  [De Martis] Even if Berlusconi were to break with [National 
Alliance leader] Fini? 
  [Bindi] The problem of this Right lies not only with 
National 
Alliance but with Berlusconi himself. 
  [De Martis] Why? 
  [Bindi] Because of the incompatibility of his role as head 
of 
government and his being the owner of three television channels. 
Because Forza Italia in itself is the opposite of politics seen 
as participation by the people. Because it is the expression of 
the entrenched financial interests. Because it legitimated two 
radical and populist right-wing parties. 
  [De Martis] You are aiming at an accord with the 
progressives 
then? 
  [Bindi] No, the difference between me and Buttiglione is 
that 
he wants to build a Center-Right group and therefore has already 
chosen which field to play in. I want to build a Center without 
allies, which, because of its specific political battles, will 
be able to attract people from both the current Center-Right and 
current Center-Left. 
  [De Martis] But such bipolarity.... 
  [Bindi] Once the extreme Right and Left have been put on the 
sideline, the alternative will be a reconstructed Center and a 
moderate Left. However, even the Left cannot pretend that the 
problem lies only with [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti. 
The problem is the PDS, with its governing class, structure, and 
desire to control. If it does not change, we cannot hope to 
have a modern evolution in the Italian Left. 
  [De Martis] Where will the PPI [Italian Popular Party] fit 
into this picture? 
  [Bindi] The PPI must also be an alternative to this renewed 
Left. However, if the Right were to continue to become radical 
instead of evolving, then it would be our duty to ally ourselves 
with this new Left. If we were in France and had to choose 
between the Socialist Delors and the Liberal Giscard we, as 
Catholics, would have to ally ourselves with the second. 
However, if Berlusconi, Fini, and [Northern League Secretary] 
Bossi were to be still there instead of Giscard, then we could 
do nothing else but ally ourselves with Delors. 
  [De Martis] Why do you want Romano Prodi [chairman of the 
Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] as PPI secretary? 
  [Bindi] Because he is the one who best incarnates the policy 
of a Center that is capable of drawing consensus from all 
directions. He has demonstrated that he knows what the Center 
means in relation to the Right and Left in connection with a 
specific political battle, that of privatization. 
  [De Martis] Did the Buttiglione-De Mita meeting surprise 
you? 
  [Bindi] It is part of the strategy preceding a congress. 
Buttiglione is looking for an ally. 
  [De Martis] Will he find one in De Mita? 
  [Bindi] De Mita is an intelligent person. If I understand 
his line of thinking, I think that he will not support 
Buttiglione. 
  [De Martis] Will the congress really take place in July? 
  [Bindi] By postponing the deadline for membership to the end 
of May, it has in fact become impossible to hold the congress 
before the summer. There are two choices therefore: either the 
congress is postponed until after the summer on the basis of new 
membership and this regency is maintained; or a "radical" 
congress will be organized before the summer just to elect the 
secretary, leaving the membership issue until another 
traditional congress is held.

<F P=106> [Article by Tulio Fazzolari: "Conversion on the Road to </F>
Arcore"] 
txt}[Text] First, the owners of small- and medium-sized 
companies. Then came the big fish, catching Agnelli by surprise. 
Minds change in a hurry. Now there is an army behind Forza 
Italia, an army that is almost as big as the Confindustria 
[General Confederation of Italian Industry]. 
  Silvio in the midst of the salami makers. Friday, 6 May, 
Berlusconi will be the guest of honor at the food industry's 
convention. For the first time in the history of the Republic, a 
head of state will make his debut among the manufacturers of 
bologna and mozzarella. For Berlusconi, however, this is almost 
a mandatory act of appreciation. In fact, it is the victorious 
general who goes out to thank his most faithful veterans. It was 
the leaders of the food industry, guided by their president, 
Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara from Bologna (in other 
words, the owner of the well-known company Idrolitina), who were 
the most enthusiastic supporters of Berlusconi's entrance into 
the political arena. 
  By now, however, they represent just the older nucleus of 
the 
army of followers that the Forza Italia leader can count on 
among the industrialists. Even though the Confindustria 
president, Luigi Abete, continues to repeat 
vigorously that "the Confindustria does not take sides," in 
reality, the industrialists have indeed taken sides, and how. 
And of course, they are on the winner's side. Evidence of their 
approval of Berlusconi was demonstrated at the meeting the 
industrialists' organization held in Verona on 15 and 16 April. 
An audience of owners, large and small, almost clapped their 
hands off whenever any speaker made favorable mention of the new 
majority's platforms. Outgoing Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi received only scattered applause out of courtesy. Worse 
yet, a charismatic entrepreneur like FIAT president Gianni 
Agnelli risked a confrontation when he let it be known that 
in the Senate he would still vote for Giovanni Spadolini for 
speaker of the house, and not for Carlo Scognamiglio, 
Berlusconi's candidate. 
  The opposition to Agnelli was too strong to have come only 
from Gazzoni Frascara and the other pioneers of Forza Italia. 
They were joined by a crowd of converts, even though they 
represented different shades and meanings. Berlusconi's 
last-minute followers included many anonymous figures, but also 
many prominent Italian industrialists who, until recently, had 
not hidden their animosity toward the Fininvest president. Even 
Pietro Marzotto, who has always been considered an 
almost overly independent man and someone who is completely 
averse to following the latest trends, has begun to take sides. 
"If I were Agnelli," he stated at the end of the Verona meeting, 
"I would take into consideration the way the industrialists 
applauded Scognamiglio." In short, Marzotto would have voted 
according to Berlusconi's wishes. And yet, it was he who, 12 
days earlier (and, therefore, even after the elections), had 
pronounced the following, unequivocal words: "Berlusconi as 
prime minister would be a mistake. Not from a lack of 
appreciation, but I find it unthinkable that a large publisher, 
an entrepreneur who owns newspapers and television channels, 
could become the head of the government." 
  But when the unthinkable becomes reality, even Marzotto 
adapts. His Veneto region gave the right 53 percent of their 
votes and, without a doubt, the Venetian industrialists under 
the long-time leadership of Marzotto contributed to this 
success. It is necessary, therefore, to bow to the will of the 
masses. A similar turnabout occurred in Rome on Thursday, 7 
April, during the Confindustria directors' meeting. The 
industrialists' leaders are still in shock over the elections 
results. "We miscalculated," Abete admits to his closest 
colleagues. 
  The magnitude of Berlusconi's victory stunned the 
Confindustria leadership, which had hoped that the center would 
hold better than it did. All the people who previously had been 
critical of Berlusconi have been left speechless by Forza 
Italia's triumph. Abete is silent and so is Aldo 
Fumagalli, the feisty president of the young entrepreneurs 
who is a strong believer in the Pact for Italy and tends to 
sympathize with the Democratic Alliance. Instead, the leader of 
the oil industrialists,Gian Marco Moratti, is 
talking. From the very first comments of his speech, it is 
immediately clear that the only incompatibility existing between 
him and Berlusconi is that he is an Inter soccer team fan. Other 
than that, Moratti adheres closely to the political positions 
held by the owner of the Milan soccer team and the future Prime 
Minister. "As long as there is no government," Moratti 
concluded, "Italy Inc. is closed. Therefore, it is better to set 
aside doubts and concerns and clear the way for Berlusconi." No 
sooner said than done. The number of industrialists siding with 
Berlusconi are increasing every day. As a consequence, those 
individuals who had already chosen Forza Italia have gained 
importance within the Confindustria. People like Gazzoni 
Frascara or the Assolombarda [Industrial Association of 
Lombardy] president, Ennio Presutti. The stock of the 
Northern League's Vito Gnutti, whom everyone expects 
will be a minister in Berlusconi's future government, has also 
risen. And even an unknown, like Giampiero Beccaria, 
the managing director of Necchi who was elected in Pavia for the 
Freedom Alliance has become a political reference point. 
  But the feelings of the masses cannot be left in the hands 
of 
individuals such as these. Confindustria leaders know this and 
have started to make up for lost time. Behind the scenes of the 
Verona convention, Abete had harsh words of criticism for 
Ciampi: "He cannot come here as Prime Minister and then speak 
like a politician." The industrialists who hear these words 
immediately think that Abete has a plan. First, he will bury 
Ciampi's government, whose work he had generously supported, and 
then he will make overtures to Berlusconi's government. 
  Other industrialists do not even bother to proceed step by 
step. Former Confindustria president, Vittorio 
Merloni, has now rejected both his old Christian Democratic 
persuasion and his more recent one of approval for Mario Segni's 
Pact for Italy. Now all his affections are reserved for Forza 
Italia. Like the true entrepreneur that he is, Merloni can even 
give an explanation for this change in marketing terms: A 
preelection survey in his Marches region predicted a massive 
swing of the population away from the center and toward Forza 
Italia. And Merloni moved along with them. 
  Further north, the battle flag is being lowered by another 
former Confindustria president, Luigi Lucchini, who 
in Brescia had stubbornly resisted the rising of the League. 
When Berlusconi decided to become a candidate, Lucchini 
commented--citing an old Lombardy proverb--that everyone should 
stick to their own jobs. Two months later in Verona, Lucchini 
was among those who tried to explain to Agnelli that he should 
not unduly insist on Spadolini's nomination as Senate speaker of 
the house. Furthermore, the former Confindustria president, like 
Moratti, now states that a Berlusconi government is the only, 
and therefore, the best solution. 
  This attitude is increasing among the Roman Catholic 
industrialists. For them there is even a theological explanation 
for the success of the Forza Italia leader: Berlusconi is an 
"inferior being," but he is still the result of God's will. In 
more down-to-earth terms, it means: Since he exists, better that 
he govern with us than without us or even against us. So, the 
platoon of industrialists who had preferred Segni or 
Martinazzoli is thinning out more and more. The feisty Fumagalli 
continues to keep silent and prepares to hand over the reins to 
Alessandro Riello, who certainly does not appear to 
be an anti-Berlusconi warrior. And even if Fumagalli does not 
know it, there could be a dramatic change in his attitude, since 
the Right intends to put forward his name for president of RAI 
[Italian Broadcasting Corporation]. 
  Unexpected capitulations confirm that the group of 
non-Berlusconi supporters is in the process of dispersing. An 
incorrigible like Giancarlo Lombardi is beginning to 
admit that the Forza Italia leader knows how to restore the 
country's confidence. Until the end of March he, too, had said 
that Berlusconi could not expect to have the unanimous support 
of the industrialists and, above all, that the right did not 
have convincing platforms. 
  Now their positions have softened. Many, including Abete, 
are 
making a few demands. For example, they are asking the 
Berlusconi government not to reopen the issue of the wage 
agreement that has improved the competitiveness of Italian 
businesses. But it seems that these are actually conditions for 
an even greater support of the government. There is no trace of 
a desire to oppose Berlusconi. If proof be needed, there is an 
abundance. The industrialists have never favored playing the 
role of opponent.

<F P=106> [Carmen del Riego and Rosa Paz report: "Madrid PSOE </F>
Achieves Integration of All Sectors"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The Madrid Socialist Federation (FSM) 
congress closed yesterday with an integration agreement that 
enables the four sectors represented -- renewalists, Guerraists, 
Socialist Left, and Grassroots Renewalists [Renovadores por la 
Base] -- to be on the new Executive Committee, confirming the 
agreement previously reached by Joaquin Leguina and Jose Acosta 
that the secretary general would be renewalist Jaime Lissavetzky. 
  This agreement encountered an obstacle when it came to 
allocating the area secretaryships and, in particular, the 
secretaryship for political and institutional relations, which 
was being demanded by Guerraists and renewalists, nearly 
thwarting integration. A further meeting of the two Madrid 
leaders was needed for agreement to be restored. 
  The new Executive Committee, which was elected by 86.43 
percent of the votes, is chaired by Jose Acosta, who, together 
with Joaquin Leguina and Juan Barranco, who remain as members, 
won the congress' loudest applause. With renewalist Jaime 
Lissavetzky as secretary general, the rest of the leadership was 
divided 50-50 between the two sectors, which had to negotiate 
with the the other two -- United Left [IU] and the Grassroots 
Renewalists -- in order to bring them into the Executive 
Committee. 
  Joaquin Leguina had one of the greatest problems in ensuring 
that integration reached all sectors with IU, which was backing 
for the secretary generalship Pedro Sabando, who finally took 
over the deputy secretary generalship. At 0400, following a 
meeting of the IU delegates, these decided to join the 
leadership in the posts offered to them by Leguina. The 
agreement between Jose Acosta and the Grassroots Renewalists -- 
a sector that emerged from a split in the Madrid renewalists -- 
was easier. 
  As a result of these agreements, the Executive Committee 
comprises 44 members, of whom 16 belong to the renewalist 
sector, 18 to the Guerraist sector, six to IU, and four to the 
Grassroots Renewalists. In this distribution, the Guerraists 
take the chairmanship and the secretaryships for organization, 
institutional policy, education and culture (which falls to a 
Grassroots Renewalists representative), relations with society, 
and training, while the renewalists have the secretary 
generalship, the deputy secretary generalship, administration 
and finances, studies and programs (held by IU), the 
secretaryship for women, and a deputy secretaryship for 
institutional policy. 
  The creation of this deputy secretaryship unblocked the 
dispute between the two sectors, since in this way the 
renewalists accepted that a renewalist -- Jorge Gomez, regarded 
as belonging to this sector's flexible wing -- should hold the 
secretaryship for institutional policy, while renewalist 
Francisco Garrido will hold the deputy secretaryship. 
  The various FSM sectors acknowledged after the congress the 
effort at integration made by everybody in order to reach an 
agreement that would not represent a false conclusion, as has 
happened at previous congresses. Achieving this solution, which 
through concessions by all sides has secured an Executive 
Committee that everybody asserts "will be able to work 
unitedly," was facilitated by the political crisis suffered by 
the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] and the latest 
corruption scandals, which were also the central aspect of the 
congress proceedings and of the secretary general's speech. 
  The FSM acknowledges in a resolution "the damage caused by 
the recent scandals," although it states that "the use made of 
them by the right and certain news media is also very clear," 
and so there is a dual task: "to eliminate from our ranks all 
the corrupt people there may be, acting diligently and 
forcefully, and calling people to account where appropriate; and 
to defend supportively all honest comrades who are falsely 
accused, not allowing wholesale suspicion to set in." This is a 
task which Lissavetzky summed up as follows: "Neither certain 
corruption nor false accusation will go unpunished." 
  Corruption was mentioned by the new FSM secretary general, 
who announced in his speech following the election of the new 
Executive Committee the setting up of an ethics committee, which 
will govern the Madrid Socialists' conduct "so that society will 
realize that it is noble to work in politics and that most of us 
are honest." Recalling an advertisement for a cleaning product, 
he asserted that "we Socialists will pass the cotton test 
clearly and will pass it easily." 
  But the main thrust of Lissavetzky's speech was directed at 
unity and the loyal and integrative work that he believes has 
been achieved with the new Executive Committee -- "a reflection 
of the federal congress' spirit" -- and that, in his opinion, 
ensures that the FSM "is not the PSOE's Bronx, and if we are, we 
are a comfortable and habitable Bronx, but we will never be the 
Socialist Party's ugly duckling. I am proud to belong to the 
FSM."

<F P=106> [Xavier Ventura report: "CDC Accuses Aznar of Practicing </F>
Systematic Destabilization"] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- At the Executive Committee meeting 
held on Monday [9 May] evening, the Democratic Convergence of 
Catalonia (CDC) leadership assessed very negatively the 
"systematic campaign of destabilization" conducted by the 
People's Party and in particular by its chairman Jose Maria 
Aznar. The CDC leadership's attitude had already become clear a 
few hours earlier, at the meeting of the Convergence and Union 
[CiU] coalition's liaison committee, at which the two parties 
were in agreement in their harsh criticisms of the campaign of 
the Conservative Party, which has accused CiU of holding Spain 
prisoner in return for the support that the nationalist 
coalition gives the government and that Aznar equates with 
blackmail. 
  With respect to the People's Party leader's statements, the 
CDC Executive Committee, in addition to its negative assessment, 
found that the main opposition party is still contributing no 
consistent alternative policy. In this connection, the 
Convergence leaders confirmed the decision taken by their 
chairman, Jordi Pujol, as the only valid and responsible option 
for tackling the governability that the country needs, and thus 
resolving its delicate economic situation. 
  Most of the Executive Committee meeting was devoted to 
analysis of the Spanish political situation, especially with 
respect to the corruption cases and the resignations and changes 
that have occurred in the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers 
Party]. Following a lengthy report from Jordi Pujol, who 
explained his talks with the the prime minister, the Executive 
Committee decided to give full support -- this time without any 
dissenting voice, unlike what happened at the liaison committee 
meeting -- to the line laid down by the party, believing that 
the stance adopted by the CiU coalition is "the most responsible 
attitude," since it gives priority to the struggle against 
corruption, the policy of economic recovery, and maximum 
implementation of the economic policy. 
  The CDC Executive Committee also found that the latest 
figures confirm the beginning of an economic recovery, which 
reaffirms the stance of CiU, which deems political stability 
essential for achieving the country's economic recovery, and 
hence increasing investment, and with it, job creation. 
  In addition, Josep Antoni Duran Lleida, Democratic Union of 
Catalonia (UDC) Steering Committee chairman, stated yesterday in 
an interview on National Radio that CiU's support for the 
Socialist government could be affected by the outcome of the 
elections to the European Parliament, to be held 12 June. The 
UDC leader explained that if the PSOE loses them by a wide 
margin -- "by a large number of goals," he said -- to the 
People's Party, it would be necessary to begin a period of 
reflection on the stance of support that the nationalists give 
the government, since in that event, Duran stated, CiU "could 
not make good the electorate's lack of support for the Socialist 
Party." 
  Nevertheless, the Christian Democrat leader emphasized that 
it is possible to deduce from his remarks only the need to 
reconsider the possible support for the PSOE -- not the 
desirability of adopting a specific stance. Duran was also 
critical of the People's Party, saying that its sole program 
contribution consists of systematically demanding the 
government's resignation and repeating, "as in a farce," that 
the nationalists are blackmailing the government.

<F P=106> [Henrik Qvortrup report from the "Political Analysis" </F>
column: "Pia Kjaersgaard Is in the Pocket of the Liberal and 
Conservative People's Parties"] 
  [Text] The reaction was of the laid-back 
variety: We'll have to wait and see. Let's leave the details 
to later. We'll work it out. 
  That was the tune from Denmark's nonsocialist parties 
yesterday after the Progress Party leadership had made public in 
BERLINGSKE TIDENDE the party's very considerable demands that 
are the price of the necessary votes to support a possible 
future nonsocialist government. 
  Hereafter, no one need believe that three or four 
no-nonsense 
demands from Pia Kjaersgaard a good way in advance of the 
elections can in any way disconcert Uffe Ellemann-Jensen 
(Liberal Party) and Hans Engell (Conservative People's Party). 
The two leading nonsocialist figures know the real political 
landscape in 1994 too well for that. 
  It is quite simple. 
  It is true that the Progress Party's seats are an absolute 
mathematical prerequisite along the road toward a 
Conservative-Liberal government, but it is just as inevitable a 
conclusion that Pia Kjaersgaard's troops really have no 
alternative but to support the formation of a 
Conservative-Liberal government. For who would the Progress 
Party people otherwise choose to support -- Poul Nyrup 
Rasmussen, for example? 
  It is thoughts of this nature that are currently reassuring 
the Liberal Party and the Conservatives. And that have led to 
the slighting indulgent nonsocialist reactions to the Progress 
Party's extremely no-nonsense demands. 
  For Engell and Ellemann-Jensen can note with satisfaction 
that for the foreseeable future the Progress Party will not find 
itself in any key position that can even begin to be compared 
with that which the Radical Liberals have exploited so 
skillfully for quite a few years. 
  For while parties of the center can always make political 
capital out of the mere threat of moving toward the opposite end 
of the political spectrum, things are not so easy for the 
Progress Party: 
  The party cannot bet on two horses. It has 
support for the Liberals and the Conservatives -- or nothing. 
  This is why party leader Pia Kjaersgaard finds herself in 
difficulties when she is asked what her and her party's threat 
to the Conservatives and the Liberals really amounts 
to. 
  In the past -- this was in [Progress Party founder] Mogens 
Glistrup's day -- the threat was clear: Here the party was 
always ready to play the role of totally unpredictable player. 
A party that no one dared count on when it came to forming a 
majority. 
  That threat is scarcely real any more. After years out in 
the political cold the Progress Party is longing for the tiniest 
scrap of political influence, and Pia Kjaersgaard is the last 
person to want a return to the seventies' and eighties' 
semi-anarchist conditions in the Progress Party. 
  In the light of this, Pia Kjaersgaard's latest statements 
should probably be interpreted as a way of reassuring the 
party's grass roots who to an increasing extent are seeking real 
results at the national level in return for their support: 
  There must be no doubt among party officials that the 
party's 
flagship issues are at least being fought for. 
  And there is something else that reflects the relative 
strengths of the three nonsocialist parties. 
  Pia Kjaersgaard has already -- at a time before a 
Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party majority is a reality -- 
suffered several defeats at the hands of the Liberals and 
Conservatives. 
  First there was the question of government involvement. 
  Pia Kjaersgaard considered it "natural" that the Progress 
Party should have ministerial posts. That ambition has been 
shelved -- everybody has now admitted that at best the party's 
role will be that of parliamentary support party. 
  Then there was the question of foreign and EU [European 
Union] policy. Pia Kjaersgaard's move recently was that these 
issues should be included "from the outset" in the written 
platform of a future government. 
  "Out of the question," both Engell and Ellemann-Jensen 
immediately thundered. And that is how things were left. 
  The lesson seems therefore to be that in the final analysis 
the two big nonsocialist parties can do what they like with the 
Progress Party. 
  Nevertheless, the latest demands from the Progress Party 
have 
caught the Liberal and Conservative party leaders off balance. 
Not so much because of their content, but rather because of the 
negative signal value this "visual interference" has. 
  The truth is that what Engell and Ellemann-Jensen fear more 
than anything else is that the impression will become widespread 
among voters that there "is always some row" surrounding the 
Liberal, Conservative, and Progress parties. 
  This would -- as several politicians have pointed out -- be 
a 
real gift. Particularly to the Social Democrats who would, for 
example, fight the forthcoming election campaign by conjuring up 
the vision of the Liberal Party, the Conservative People's 
Party, and the Progress Party as an unserious and unreliable 
alliance that does not represent a credible alternative to the 
incumbent government.

<F P=106> [Article by Leena Hayrinen: "Big Propaganda War Beginning: </F>
EU: Yes or No?; Citizens' Organizations Rapidly Forming To Teach 
Finns How To Vote on Membership in European Union"] 
  [Text] "I merely respond to that by saying that Kalevi 
Sorsa seems to be a humorist. For reasons just as good as this 
in 1939 we might have said that we would become more independent 
if we got to decide on these issues as a member of the Union of 
Soviet Socialist Republics," Keijo Korhonen, a rank-and-file 
member of the People's Independence Front of Finland, quipped. 
  Korhonen was referring to a statement made by bank director 
Kalevi Sorsa at a Better Alternative -- a European Finland, Inc. 
news conference held last weekend. At that time Sorsa declared 
that he thought that the most telling argument of factions 
opposed to European Union [EU] membership was loss of 
independence. Sorsa said that, after considering many factors, 
he had come to the conclusion that Finland would become more 
independent as a member of the EU as compared with its present 
situation, in which Finland just goes along with decisions made 
elsewhere through the EEA [European Economic Area]. 
  "As a member, we will participate in influencing decisions," 
said Sorsa, who viewed the EU's discussion of a prescribed 
minority these past few weeks as a good indication of with what 
indifference Community members regard outsiders. 
  Now that the national referendum on European Union 
membership 
is approaching, supporters and opponents are quickly organizing 
themselves. This is how a number of organizations that have 
applied for funds intended for, among other things, providing 
information on integration describe the situation. Last year 
the government allocated a total of 2.7 million markkas of 
discretionary aid for information in two installments: 
Twenty-five organizations were included in the first and 26 in 
the second. Some 91 applicants, whose applications total 14 
million, are eager to get their hands on some of this year's 
2-million-markka appropriation. 
  In addition, 10 million markkas have been set aside in a 
supplementary budget for providing information on alternatives 
in the referendum. The conditions for allocating these funds 
will not, however, become clear before the bill governing the 
referendum is made public. 
  It does, however, seem to be quite clear that aspirants want 
to improve their chances of getting money for their own 
alternatives by setting up many organizations. Thus Mikko Vesa, 
who told us that he is also the chairman of the Young People's 
Europe Committee, which was formed a couple of weeks ago, 
answers the telephone at the office of No to the EU -- until now 
the VEY [expansion unknown] -- the oldest organization opposing 
membership, launched as early as 1991. 
  According to Vesa, a new, nonorganization is needed because, 
from young people's viewpoint, "men of the past's" decision on 
independence is not of any importance. Vesa said that young 
people want to mark the no box with an X for relevant reasons. 
<H5>  Papal Conspiracies? </H5>
  Three kinds of organizations and committees are distributing 
information on the EU and influencing citizens' opinions: 
supporters of membership, its opponents, and neutrals. 
  The Foreign Ministry's Information on Europe office also 
sends out the word that it is pursuing a neutral policy. Its own 
material is objectively presented, well founded, and well 
composed. The ministry's Information on Europe also distributes 
material from citizens' organizations, but it does not procure 
it for their choices. Therefore, whether they supply their 
printed matter for distribution through Information on Europe 
depends on how active these organizations are. 
  A spot check indicated that at least No to the EU has seen 
to 
the availability of its publication VAIHTOEHTO through this 
channel, as has the MTK [Agricultural Producers Association], 
among others -- both recipients of big government information 
subsidies. Since the publications were prominently in evidence, 
at least as far as this is concerned, Seppo Aaltonen of the 
Popular Front Against the EC's acrimony-tinged invitation to 
take a look at how opponents are being discriminated against did 
not produce the desired result. 
  Closely associated with the Communist Workers Party, the 
movement represented by Aaltonen backed Pekka Tiainen in the 
presidential elections. The movement's principal argument is 
"loss of independence." The EU is a federation from which, in 
its opinion, one cannot secede. Its most important form of 
activity is the publication and distribution of a paper called 
EI EUROOPAN UNIONILLE -- KYLLA SUOMELLE [No to European Union -- 
Yes to Finland]. This activity is funded by "the horny hand of 
toil." Another group that has gotten by without public support 
is the Free Finland Civic Movement, which is collecting 
signatures for a petition to be submitted to the parliament and 
which claims that it has already amassed nearly 200,000 names. 
  Membership in the EU may be supported or opposed for very 
many different reasons. There is even talk of the pope, who 
opposes the Community because he considers it to be Catholic! 
During the final vote, however, the reasons why will not be 
asked for. Therefore, both those who plan to vote yes and those 
who plan to vote no have been exploring the possibilities of 
common action. Largely personified in Hilkka Pietila in the 
press, No to the EU is cooperating with the Independence 
Society. Jan-Magnus Jansson, for example, is indeed active in 
both of them. He has also been in contact with the People's 
Independence Front of Finland, whose arguments focus primarily 
on security policy, as well as with the Social Democratic 
Independent Nation -- Cooperative World group. The 
last-mentioned opposes the EU chiefly for being a neoliberalist 
community on whose scale of goals employment, for example, does 
not occupy the position hoped for by these critical Social 
Democrats. Because of a shortage of funds, this group headed by 
Jorma Bergholm has up to now been evident primarily in 
letters-to-the-editor columns. 
<H5>  To Cooperate or Not </H5>
  During Easter Week Better Alternative -- a European Finland, 
Inc., which has begun to create a national network of local 
organizations, also explored cooperation with other 
organizations that support EU membership. 
  As a movement composed chiefly of young academicians, at 
least Yes to Europe, an independent civic organization that has 
developed an idea almost contrary to the original one, has 
responded negatively to Better Alternative -- a European 
Finland, Inc.'s wooing. Kristiina Hartikainen told us why: As a 
subsection, the youthful group, which has even produced its own 
lively publication, would certainly have been trampled 
underfoot. The movement led by her sees many reasons for joining 
the EU. She cited as one of the main reasons young people's 
opportunities to study at European universities. 
  "What personally gives me food for thought the most is the 
future of agriculture," Kristiina Hartikainen said and told us 
that she had also through a farmer friend come to understand the 
farm sector's critical views on the matter. 
  The Better Alternative -- a European Finland, Inc. citizens' 
delegation and the coalition government have also in excellent 
fashion described how EU membership is dividing the parties, on 
the one hand, and, on the other, is uniting people from groups 
with the most divergent backgrounds. For example, RKP [Swedish 
People's Party] MP Eeva Biaudet, Left League Governor Kalevi 
Kivisto, Finnish Center Party MP Olli Rehn, Greens MP Paavo 
Nikula, Conservative Party power figure Ilkka Suominen, who is 
soon to leave parliament, as well as bank director Kalevi Sorsa, 
an important and influential Social Democrat, are on the 
citizens' delegation committee. Each of them also has party 
comrades among the opponents of EU membership. 
  The plethora of civic movements, of course, reflects 
citizens' interest in the issue and because of that division is 
not necessarily regarded as a bad thing in either camp. After 
all, aside from affording them the possibility of applying for 
money, it also provides more and more of those holding different 
opinions with a goal they can identify with and a channel for 
taking action. 
<H5>  Europeans or Tenant Farmers? </H5>
  So far no action group has succeeded in assembling a large 
number of members. No to the EU is the biggest with about 4,000 
members. Better Alternative -- a European Finland has just 
started to recruit members. There are from 300 to 400 members in 
the Yes to Europe group. 
  The activities of all the organizations are at present being 
hampered by uncertainty as to when the promised referendum will 
be held. Once that is decided on, a lot of money will also be 
applied for -- how it will be divided up among supporters and 
opponents is uncertain at this point. 
  Unanimity extends only to the yes-or-no level and in one 
sense the civic movements that have arisen now are disposable 
goods. If and when the Finns take their place in the EU, they 
will certainly soon be arguing just as cleverly as before. But 
not necessarily in the organs of the Community. We must believe 
that Finns in Brussels would above all be Finns. 
  In Kalevi Sorsa's opinion, a certain reference group within 
which Finland would probably be operating is even now evident: 
The Nordic countries, Germany, and Austria are societies with 
which Finland can enter into geographical and business-based 
cooperation. Social thinking and equality are those areas in 
which Finland could serve as a leading or exemplary country in 
the EU. 
  Finland would also be able to provide its experience as a 
builder of bridges between East and West. "At the same time our 
own security will be best served," Sorsa felt. In his opinion, 
staying out of the Union would mean identifying with a group in 
which Finland does not belong. 
  "Unthinkable. I look on anyone who with open eyes advocates 
that Finland join the EU as a traitor," Keijo Korhonen of 
Kajaani lashed out. He can only explain supporters' behavior as 
the gullibility of primitive tenant farmer folk. 
  "Sheep have to be treated like sheep: with an ax to the 
head." Korhonen condemned them and insinuated that he could 
certainly brush the EU-Finland dust off their birchbark shoes.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Simopekka Nortamo, former HELSINGIN SANOMAT </F>
chief editor: "Beliefs Regarding EU Discussion: 1"] 
  [Text] During President of the Republic Mauno Koivisto's 
farewell interview on television Channel 2 the day before the 
change of presidents, he was asked a clear and brief question: 
"Should Finland join the European Union [EU]?" 
  Koivisto's reply was even briefer: "Unquestionably," he 
said. 
  At that time the negotiations in Brussels had not yet been 
concluded, nor was the exact final result known. 
  Koivisto stressed the fact that the differences of opinion 
that arose during the negotiations were not very important ones. 
  On the following day, in the speech he delivered before the 
Eduskunta, new President Martti Ahtisaari said that Finland 
would secure its future best as a member of the European Union. 
  The membership negotiations were only in the final stretch 
at 
that moment, and no one could have said exactly what the final 
result would be. 
  How could two Finnish presidents so unhesitatingly voice a 
positive stand on EU membership even though they did not yet at 
that point know what might be agreed on in Brussels with 
reference to subsidies for Southern Finnish farmers or the 
cultivation of vegetables and cut flowers? 
  The answer is an easy one. The presidents did not entertain 
the belief that seemed to prevail among most Finns: that the 
details of the agreement negotiated in Brussels will presumably 
be decisive when we estimate "whether it will pay" for Finland 
to join the EU. 
  Of course, it was important for Finland's negotiators to 
successfully put the finishing touches to the agreement as well 
-- beyond any realistic hopes. Many different kinds of monetary 
values were involved. 
  However, we should bear in mind that the most important and 
essential issue of all from the standpoint of Finland's 
membership is not included at all in the agreement concluded in 
Brussels. It was not even negotiated there. 
  This is why the differences of opinion in Brussels "were not 
very important," as Koivisto put it. 
  What is important is the fact that the opportunity has 
finally opened up to Finland to quite openly link itself with 
other Western-style democracies -- unless Finland itself decides 
to remain a no-man's-land between East and West in which our 
political and economic reference groups are the former Soviet 
states and satellites.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Organizations Opposed to EU </F>
Membership Starting To Cooperate"] 
  [Text] [no place-name as published] STT -- Civic 
organizations opposed to Finland's membership in the European 
Union [EU] are beginning to cooperate with one another. Four 
organizations have founded Independent Finland -- the Best 
Alternative, a cooperative organ for the antimembership 
campaign. The participating organizations are: Independent 
Nation -- Cooperative World, Finnish Independence Society, 
Finnish People's Independence Front, and the Alternative to the 
EU Information Center. 
  The purpose of the cooperative organ is to serve as an 
umbrella organization and other movements holding the same views 
are invited to join it. They plan to draft a plan for a 
nationwide campaign with in a couple of weeks. 
<H5>  Referendum Must Be Postponed Until Next Year </H5>
  On Thursday [14 April] the executive committee of the 
cooperative organ demanded that, since sufficient time has to be 
allowed for discussion by citizens, the referendum be postponed 
until next year. In the executive committee's opinion, 
postponement of the vote would create better opportunities than 
before to assess Finland's position from the standpoints of both 
Nordic cooperation and Europe's changing conditions. 
  "Citizens want to know about the EU's real values, power 
relations, and political goals as well as how it will affect 
Finland's constitutional democratic rights and obligations," the 
cooperative organ emphasizes in its official declaration. 
  Greens MP Erkki Pulliainen is the chairman of the executive 
committee. The members are: Seamen's Union chairman Per-Erik 
Nelin (Social Democrat), Hilkka Pietila (Center Party), bachelor 
of agriculture and forestry , Professor Pekka Puska (Center 
Party), and General Manager Ylermi Runko (Social Democrat). 
Professor Jan-Magnus Jansson (Swedish People's Party) serves as 
chairman of the cooperative organ's advisory committee. 
  The opponents of membership suffer from a perpetual shortage 
of money. A grant to be applied for from the government occupies 
an important place in the procurement of funds. 
  The invisibility of opponents of membership's opinions is 
also a cause for concern. The members of the executive committee 
complain that opponents' views do not receive sufficient 
exposure in the media.

<F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "Growing Numbers Favor </F>
Membership"] 
  [Text] Ever-increasing numbers of Finns support Finnish EU 
[European Union] membership. According to an opinion poll, 
which the Committee of Finnish Industry and Commerce, EVA, 
published yesterday, 40 percent of Finns support joining the EU, 
while 37 percent say no. However, these figures do not 
represent any major change. In a similar poll last fall, 39 
percent supported membership, while 41 percent said no. 
  Over 50 percent of Finns say that they have a poor or very 
poor knowledge of the content of the package that emerged from 
the negotiations and that over 50 percent describe as 
"satisfactory" or "defensible." Some 63 percent say that 
agriculture has too prominent a place in Finland's final EU 
agreement. 
  Even if the overall figures have not changed very much, it 
is 
possible to note changes within various population groups. 
Young people are not as enthusiastic, while support for 
membership has grown among the adult population. 
  Support among the less well educated population has 
increased 
at the same time as it has decreased among those with higher 
education. And some former supporters of membership have become 
uncertain. 
  EVA's poll was carried out between 30 March and 6 May. A 
total of 1,900 Finns between 18 and 70 participated in written 
interviews.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Clear Slowdown of Growth in Export </F>
Value"] 
  [Text] The slower trend in the growth of exports that began 
in February continued in the March foreign trade statistics. 
The value of exports rose by a mere 6 percent in March as 
against 23 percent during the same period last year. 
  The cumulative increase in exports for the period 
January-March was 11 percent, whereas it was still at 24 percent 
the year before. The active trade balance, however, has 
continued to grow as the result of a reduction in the value of 
imports, which fell by 19 percent in February and 9 percent in 
March. The accumulated surplus for the period January-March was 
9.8 billion Finnish markkas [FMk]. This surplus exceeds the 
same figure for 1993 by FMk4.5 billion, i.e., 86 percent. 
<H5>  Surplus in Trade With Russia </H5>
  Finland's trade figures show surplus with nearly every 
country to which it exports. The highest cumulative figures for 
the period January-March relate to trade with Britain, Sweden, 
Germany, and the Netherlands. These show a total surplus of 
more than FMk1 billion in Finland's favor. Trade with Russia 
also showed a surplus for the early part of the year, but only 
of FMk140 million. The value of exports to Russia grew in 
January-March by 70 percent while the value of imports dropped 
by 12 percent. Exports to Germany rose to FMk4.8 billion, which 
made it Finland's most important customer for exports. 
  The greatest deficit for the January-March period was, as 
usual, to be seen in trade with Japan. Finland's imports from 
Japan exceeded exports by FMk1 billion, although exports rose by 
45 percent. The slower growth of exports became evident in what 
is financially the most important sector, namely metal products 
and machinery, where, in the period January-March, the value of 
exports grew by only 12 percent compared to 42 percent last 
year. Exports of products in the paper and printing industry 
sector rose by 5 percent as against 18 percent last year. 
Exports rose in the sectors of textiles, clothing, leather, 
footwear, chemicals, and mining products, but their share of 
Finland's total export value is modest. Exports of chemical 
products grew in value from 4 to 6 percent.

  [Text] Prime Minister Hakki Atun, Deputy Prime Minister 
Ozker Ozgur, and Communal Liberation Party [CLP] leader Mustafa 
Akinci have received Felix Bogdanov and Fiotr Dobroserdov, 
Russian Foreign Ministry officials, and conferred with them for 
some time. The Russian officials visited the Democratic Party, 
the Republican Turkish Party, and the CLP headquarters today and 
exchanged views on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] with 
the party leaders. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Atun said he explained the 
Turkish Cypriot views on the recent developments, adding that he 
gave details on the discrepancies between the CBM package 
accepted in principle and the current problems that have arisen. 
Pointing out that he explained to the Russian officials the 
source of the current impasse, Atun stressed that the Turkish 
Cypriots expect simultaneous benefits from the package. Noting 
that the Turkish Cypriot side is waiting to receive information 
on which countries Turkish Cypriot flights taking off from 
Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport will be able to land in and on what 
kind of documents will be necessary, Atun said that the United 
Nations should have a practical solution to this issue. He 
added that it was explained to the Russian officials that the 
Greek Cypriot side cannot make the Turkish Cypriot side its 
legality, adding that this is an entirely different issue. 
  In reply to a question on whether the Vienna talks on the 
CBM's were assessed, Atun said that efforts will continue to 
define the differences of views between the two sides. 
  In a statement during his meeting with the Russian 
officials, 
Ozgur recalled that Russia is one of the five permanent UN 
Security Council members, adding that in that capacity, Russia 
is interested in the Cyprus problem. He noted that an 
agreement acceptable to both sides regarding the implementation 
of the CBM's may be reached through the goodwill of the two 
sides. 
  Speaking after his meeting with the Russian delegation, Atay 
Ahmet Rasit, foreign affairs and defense minister, said that the 
Turkish Cypriot side is ready to contribute to reestablishing 
the balance in the CBM package, which was upset by the 21 March 
document, and to continue the talks to achieve that end. He 
added that the contacts are aimed at launching this process. 
  In a statement prior to the meeting, Akinci said his party 
has always maintained a positive approach regarding measures 
aimed at creating a rapprochement between the two communities on 
the island. He added that through mutual goodwill, a solution 
can definitely be found. He concluded: Everyone should exert 
every effort possible. The greatest duty, however, befalls the 
two peoples and their administrators. 
  Dobroserdov said that Russia, which is one of the five 
permanent members of the UN Security Council, takes an interest 
in the Cyprus issue and especially in the CBM package, adding 
that his presence in Cyprus is aimed at listening to the views 
of the parties concerned. Stressing that Russia attaches great 
importance to the package, Dobroserdov said: One cannot advance 
toward the solution of the actual problem without implementing 
the CBM's. 
  In a statement after his meeting with Atun, Dobroserdov said 
that the meeting had been very positive, adding that Atun's 
explanations were important in terms of determining the Russian 
position.

  [Text] The talks on the confidence-building measures 
[CBM's] continue in Vienna. Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary 
general's alternate special representative, continued the talks 
with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' envoys in the presence 
of Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on

  [Text] In a talk with Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation 
correspondents Dhimitrios Andreou and Konstandinos Yennaris, 
U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher said the United States is ready 
to study alternative approaches to the Cyprus issue, but he does 
not believe that the effort to promote the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's] has failed. 
  [Begin recording] [Andreou] The U.S. ambassador had not yet 
been briefed on the talks in Vienna, so he refrained from 
evaluating their progress. He reiterated that the United States 
and the United Nations will make every effort to reach an 
agreement on the CBM's. Commenting on a remark that there is an 
impression that everything is limited to these efforts, the U.S. 
ambassador said he is not in a position to say whether more 
could be done. He said: We are applying a great deal of 
pressure. If this effort fails, other ways will be considered. 
If there is a way to implement the measures, we will try to 
find it. 
  [Addressing Boucher] Are you ready to consider alternative 
ways and even measures under Chapter 7 of the UN Security 
Council? [not further specified] 
  [Boucher] We are ready to consider alternate ways. I think 
it would be immature for me at this point to start addressing 
what those will be. The effort has not yet failed. 
  [Yennaris] Are there any other ideas floating around, other 
alternatives? 
  [Boucher] There are all kinds of ideas floating around but 
we 
have not settled on any of them. 
  [Andreou] Referring to the Vienna talks, Boucher said we are 
not seeking ways to prolong the talks but ways to reach an 
agreement. He added that every negotiation has a point at which 
you either reach an agreement or turn somewhere else. He 
concluded: Until then, we will continue trying. 
  [Yennaris] What is the specific aim of the exercise in 
Vienna? 
  [Boucher] The effort in Vienna is -- even while the report 
on 
the last few months of negotiations is being discussed -- to try 
to make sure that we have explored every possible avenue for 
reaching an agreement on the basis of the UN proposal. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Takis Dhiamandis from Gjirokaster] </F>
  [Text] The Greek minority organization in Albania, Omonoia, 
is trying to straighten out its internal issues and change its 
profile following tension caused by the bloody incident at an 
Albanian military camp in Episkopi on 10 April. 
  A few days after the incident, Albanian authorities began 
arresting Omonoia members, including people who had previously 
been involved only in provocative or inflammatory statements in 
Greek media. In most houses the Albanian police claim they 
discovered propaganda material from various North Ipirote 
organizations active in Greece in support of North Ipiros' 
independence or autonomy. 
  And it is not just this. The Albanian Government, indirectly 
so far, has described Omonoia as a terrorist organization, a 
description that has already been used in several progovernment 
or nationalistic press reports. 
<H5>  Ten Decisions </H5>
  These facts forced Omonoia's leadership to make some 
decisions. In its first meeting last week, the new general 
council made 10 decisions, three of which concerned Omonoia's 
image in the outside world, the other decisions concerned 
procedural issues. Specifically it decided: 
  1. The organization will separate from every association or 
organization by North Ipirotes outside Albania. These 
associations will be asked not to get involved in internal 
Omonoia issues. 
  2. Omonoia members must have the discipline to release 
statements to the mass media that are in line with the positions 
adopted by the organization. To represent Omonoia or express 
the organization's views, they must be authorized by the general 
presidium. 
  3. The organization will dispatch messages to the Greek mass 
media -- particularly television channels such as Mega and 
Antenna -- to avoid misleading reports on what is happening to 
the Greek minority. 
  This message will also be sent to Government spokesman 
Evangelos Venizelos, the Foreign Ministry, etc. Omonoia 
President Sotirios Kiriazatis intends to give a news conference 
in Tirana soon to brief the Albanian mass media, and through 
them the political parties and the Albanian people, about 
Omonoia's views on the Greek minority's position and role within 
Albanian society, in order to avoid being misunderstood or 
becoming an object of exploitation by anyone.

    [Editorial Report] The results of a poll by the Hellenic 
Research House on behalf of the CIVITAS A.E. company, conducted 
from 30 March to 12 April among 925 individuals in the Athens 
area, appeared in the 29 April Athens daily TA NEA, along with a 
commentary by D. Dhasenakis. According to poll results, a 
majority of respondents (89 percent) agreed with the statement 
that "our country is going through a period filled with 
dangers," while only 11 percent disagreed, with figures cutting 
across party lines. When asked whether Greece "gained from the 
European Union (EU)," 23 percent agreed, 30 percent rather 
agreed, 19 percent rather disagreed, 18 percent disagreed, and 9 
percent did not know. According to Dhasenakis, of those who 
agreed, 70 percent belong to the New Democracy (ND) and to 
Political Spring. When queried whether "Europeans are 
anti-Greek," 36 percent fully agreed and 28 percent rather 
agreed, compared to 17 percent who rather disagreed, 12 percent 
who disagreed, and 7 percent who did not know. The majority of 
those who agreed support the Panhellenic Socialist Movement 
(PASOK) and Political Spring. 
  Suspicion of foreigners surfaced also in the response to the 
statement that "foreigners do not understand us in national 
issues," as 84 percent of the respondents agreed. Nevertheless, 
65 percent disagreed with the statement that "Greece is strong 
and needs no one." 
  Another question asked whether "there should be less 
government intervention in the economy." Some 57 percent agreed, 
while 32 percent did not. It is noteworthy, Dhasenakis points 
out, that according to poll results, majorities expressing 
reservations on the role of the state exist across party lines, 
and even in the Left. 
  When the statement "tax evasion is not stealing" was put to 
the respondents, 8 percent agreed with it, 8 percent rather 
agreed, 16 percent rather disagreed, 63 percent disagreed, and 5 
percent did not know. Dhasenakis reports that most of those who 
tolerate tax evasion said they had voted for Political Spring 
(19 percent) and for the ND (20 percent). He adds that no 
Communist Party (KKE) voter agreed with the statement. Finally, 
the poll also showed that 43 percent of Athenians believe that 
"pulling strings is a necessary evil."

  [Text] Ankara, 12 May 1994 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Ferhat Ataman declared on Thursday [12 May] that 
Athens' desire to extend its territorial waters to 12 nautical 
miles is unacceptable. 
  Until 1936, Greece had limited its territorial waters to 3 
miles. After the Montreux Convention on the straits, it extended 
its territorial waters to 6 nautical miles. 
  Turkey claims that Athens' extension of its territorial 
waters to 12 nautical miles will be considered a declaration of 
war. 
  Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas [name as 
received] affirmed that it is Greece's sovereign right to extend 
its waters to 12 nautical miles.

  [Text] Greece is risking a war with Turkey by preparing to 
extend its territorial waters to 12 miles on 16 November. In 
accordance with a secret military plan Athens has drawn up, that 
country has already deployed 60 percent of its military forces 
against Turkey. 
  Greece's plan was finalized after aging Andreas Papandreou, 
who is known for his harsh statements against Turkey, came to 
power. Consequently, the Greek Armed Forces have completely 
changed their defense strategy. The Greek Government decided 
that Greece is confronted with a threat not from the former 
Soviet Union in the north, but from Turkey on the eastern side 
of the Aegean Sea. As such, many of the military units in 
northern Greece have been transferred to Western Thrace. The 
Greek defense line was also reestablished beginning on the 
western side of the Maritsa River and extending to the Greek 
islands in the Aegean Sea, which are very close to Turkey. Two 
infantry divisions on Bulgaria's border and two armored brigades 
and an infantry brigade have taken up positions along Turkey's 
border. 
  Furthermore, support units have been organized for the 
border 
between Turkey and Greece. Thessaloniki has been selected as 
their headquarters. According to the information we have 
received, they are made up of one infantry brigade, one armored 
brigade, one commando regiment, and one paratroop regiment. The 
units that will move into action in the Aegean Sea in the event 
of a war have been reinforced with a naval infantry brigade, a 
commando regiment, and a paratroop regiment. 
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Andreas Papandrou and his son, 
Yeoryios Papandreou, have been secretly working on a plan in the 
diplomatic field to involve the European Union in a possible war 
between Turkey and Greece. 
<H5>  Ataman: "No Concession on 12 Miles" </H5>
  One of YENI GUNAYDIN's correspondents has asked Turkish 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman to comment on a report 
we published a few days ago on Greece's warmongering 
initiatives. He said: "It seems that Greece has finalized its 
plan to extend its territorial waters to 12 miles." 
<H5>  Kilercioglu: "Greece is Making an Effort" </H5>
  Ahmet Dokulmez, one of the Prosperity Party members on the 
National Assembly Foreign Relations Committee, has warned that 
an effort is being made to place Turkey in a difficult position 
in international forums. Calling for measures to counter that 
eventuality, he said: "We are economically weak and in need of 
funds. Nevertheless, we have to adopt a hardline policy because 
that is the approach the Western countries understand." 
  Former Minister of State Orhan Kilercioglu reacted as 
follows: "That would be regarded as a cause for war. I do not 
believe that the Greeks will do anything so crazy. 
Nevertheless, preparations have to be made; we have to be 
prepared. Greece is making an effort in that direction."

  [Text] Ankara--In order to continue as legal political 
entity, the members of the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP) 
have founded the People's Democracy Party (HADEP) as a decision 
to close the DEP is pending in the Constitutional Court. 
  The petition regarding the HADEP's foundation will 
reportedly 
be presented to the Interior Ministry today. After pro-longed 
discussions on whether the new party should be called the 
Democratic People's Party or the Peace and Democracy Party, the 
DEP members have finally decided to give it the former name. 
Former DEP Secretary-General Murat Bozlak has been appointed 
chairman of the new party, the emblem of which will be a 
butterfly with black spots on its wings. 
  As the new party was being founded, the DEP rank and file 
took part in heated discussions, laying the foundations for 
division. The supporters of the Kurdistan Socialist Party (PSK) 
led by Kemal Burkay, the pro-Kurdistan Democrat Party-Unity 
(PDK-Hevgirtin) and the pro-Rizgari have not been included in 
the new party. 
  Hasan Celalettin Ezman, a former Republican People's Party 
(CHP) deputy from Bingol between 1973-1980, will be given a post 
in the party. 
  Arguments that the new party should tend towards the left 
and 
defend the rights of the Turkish and the Kurdish people, as the 
DYP [as published] has serious faults and inadequacies, have 
influenced the shape taken by the new party. 
  However due to the fact that the majority of the founders of 
the new party are Kurdish gives a hint that it will not easily 
lose its Kurdish image. According to party sources the fact 
that the program mentions elements such as peace, brotherhood 
and humanism and that it is determined to use the political 
platform until the end will help it to gain a leftist image. 
With the foundation of HADEP, the Kurds in the political arena 
will have realized their ambition to establish a new party. 
  If the DEP is closed, the HADEP will continue its 
activities. 
However it is known that some groups, who are not happy with 
HADEP, are trying to found a separate party. The PSK supporters 
have cut off their ties with the DEP and have not taken part in 
HADEP. PSK members are reportedly trying to found a legal 
Kurdish party. Halil Aksoy, a DEP member and active in the PSK, 
has resigned from the DEP. Refik Karakoc, Kmela Yuksel, Latif 
Epozdemir and Fethi Demir have also resigned from the DEP. 
Serafettin Elci is proposing to found another Kurdish party. 
It is known that Elci is continuing his activities in this 
respect but there have been no concrete developments as yet. 
Furthermore it is reported that Elci plans to exclude all 
radical Kurdish groups and found a party which has the support 
of pro state people and village guards. However it is said that 
this party will not have wide spread Kurdish support. However, 
the following view which is voiced in Kurdish circles is worth 
mentioning: 
  "Let all the Kurdish groups found their respective political 
parties and led the legal channels in this regard be opened. 
This is very important to the solution of the Kurdish question. 
Let the Kurds have the possibility to represent themselves 
legally." The political spectrum will become more colorful with 
the foundation of new Kurdish parties but under existing laws no 
Kurdish words are permitted in their programs. We shall soon 
wee what formulas are found to circumvent this ban.

  [Text] Diyarbakir--The state forces are maintaining their 
blockade against the villages in the mountainous area in the 
triangle of Diyarbakir's Kulp and Lice and Bingol's Genc 
Districts. They besieged the area after clashing with guerrillas 
affiliated with the Kurdish Workers Party's Kurdish People's 
Liberation Army on 26 April. They are allowing no one to enter 
or leave the villages. Riz (Saggoze), Satoz (Yazkonak), Arxat 
(Yolacti), and Azgler (Geyikdere) in Genc district; Pecar 
(Guldiken) in Lice district; and Zara [not further specified]

  We asked a villager to explain the situation in the besieged 
villages. He said: "A clash occurred near Satoz on 26 April. 
The state forces besieged all the villages and farming 
settlements in the area after the fighting. No one has been 
allowed to enter or leave the area." 
  Several villagers say that no information has been received 
on the situation in the farming settlements of Norsin, Lehesar, 
Mordari, and Herki. Stressing that revelations by the State of 
Emergency Governor's Office conflict with the realities, the 
villagers said that the troops shot and killed a girl of 15. 
The officials, they said, described her as a "terrorist." They 
also said that three shepherds were killed in attacks on the 
farming settlement of Ziqte. They noted that they were unable 
to establish their names. 
  The State of Emergency Governor's Office revealed yesterday 
that "the security forces have killed 14 terrorists in Saggoze 
in Genc district and three terrorists in Karliova District's 
rural areas." 
  The villages and farming settlements that have been besieged 
are as follows: Riz (Saggoze) and its farming settlements: 
Norsin, Mordari, Herkin, Prons, Xizginos, and Avdos; Azgler 
(Geyikdere) and its farming settlements: Misware, Saxuk, Sinat, 
Gelbe, Xedesimat, Tiryar, Kusiya, Sergewlik, Xiznanos, Siyere,

Girdara (Ormanyudur), and Gundikesex [not further specified] in 
Siirt's Eruh district were besieged by the state forces during

  [Text] Kurd-A/Zalkah--With the clashes between the 
Democratic Party of Kurdistan [DPK] and the Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan [PUK] in south Kurdistan [north Iraq] about to end, 
Cemil Bayik, head of the Workers Party of Kurdistan's [PKK] 
Kurdish People's Liberation Army, has informed Kurd-A [KURDISH 
NEWS AGENCY] that the fighting was the outcome of direct and 
indirect provocation by various countries. Stressing that the 
fighting involves those who want to maintain the status quo and 
those who oppose it, Bayik said the people are against bloodshed 
among brothers. He asserted: "Eleven organizations have 
established two separate groups to work to end the clashes. But 
some circles want to change the status quo in the south. 
France, Turkey, and Iraq want to have the status quo changed in 
favor of Mas'ud Barzani. They want to further the concept of 
autonomy. The United States and Britain want the situation to 
stay as it is." 
  Defending the view that the people can influence the effort 
to end the clashes, Bayik said they will try to strengthen the 
people's opposition to the fighting. He asserted: "The PKK has 
made an intensive effort to obstruct the fratricide since the 
clashes began. It considered the wish of the people for an end 
to the fighting and received significant support. The people's 
strengthening opposition shows that support. Professional 
establishments, mass organizations, and students are part of the 
protest move. The success of that effort depends on the stance 
of the DPK and PUK. More effective results can be achieved if a 
concerted effort is made. Time will show how effective the 
effort that is being made will be. The clashes may escalate 
because the DPK and PUK do not trust each other. They do not 
seem willing to end the fighting. We are trying to strengthen 
the people's opposition. We will make it more effective. The 
people are opposed to the clashes. They are uneasy. They want 
the fratricide to end as soon as possible. The people have 
protested the issue and delivered warnings. Those who do not 
heed them will be unable to account for their behavior."

<F P=106> [Lionel Barber and David Marsh report: "EMU Fans Ready To </F>
Move the Goalposts"] 
  [Text] In Britain, the issue of economic and monetary 
union (EMU) has lit a fuse along the European election trail. 
In the rest of the continent, the subject is being given a lot 
less attention. None the less, the question of whether policies 
aimed at establishing EMU are consistent with efforts to bring 
down unemployment has explosive potential. 
  Across the continent, the fiercest discussions over whether 
EMU will take place by the Maastricht target dates of 1997 or 
1999 are taking place in northern Europe. 
  Despite Britain's "opt-out" from participation in a single 
currency, `Eurosceptics' in the UK Conservative party this week 
have focused on the EMU plan in their calls for a referendum on 
the shape of Europe. 
  In Germany and France, left- and right-wing anti-Maastricht 
parties are aiming for support on the somewhat contradictory 
basis that the EMU plan will undermine both German and French 
sovereignty. 
  In France, support for the franc fort policy remains solid 
among the political establishment. Yesterday's 0.5 point cut in 
Bundesbank interest rates will give the Bank of France more 
leeway to bring down interest rates and speed recovery from 
France's longest period of economic doldrums since the second 
world war. 
  On the other hand if anti-EMU parties -- including dissident 
conservatives led by Mr Philippe de Villiers, the right-wing 
National Assembly deputy -- gain more than 20 percent of the 
votes on June 12, that could unsettle France's pro-Maastricht 
stance. 
  By contrast, public debate on EMU in southern countries is 
far more muted. In Italy and Spain -- traditionally strong 
supporters of EMU but beset by domestic political uncertainties 
-- EMU comes well down the list of election issues. 
  The new government in Rome, headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, 
appears likely to take a more nationalistic line in promoting 
Italian interests in Brussels. Pushing for the lira's early 
return into the mainstream of European monetary integration is 
not expected to be one of them. 
  Nevertheless supporters of EMU across the continent have 
recovered their poise after setbacks caused by the ERM [Exchange 
Rate Mechanism] exit of Britain and Italy in September 1992 and 
the emergency widening of fluctuation bands to 15 percent last 
August. By deterring speculators, wider ERM bands have 
reinforced currency stability. 
  Since last summer, ERM central banks have lowered interest 
rates only gradually rather than resorting to competitive 
devaluations. "The spread (of interest rates) between Belgium, 
the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France and Germany is now so small 
that we are virtually in a monetary union," says one central 
bank governor. 
  One problem is that the Maastricht Treaty limits EMU 
participation to currencies which respect "the normal 
fluctuation bands for two years." However, in coming months 
European finance ministers are expected to agree a generous 
interpretation of this condition. They are likely simply to 
apply the test of whether exchange rate movements have been 
minimal. 
  The European Commission has set up a study group to prepare 
the change to the ECU as a new European currency. An advisory 
report is due by the end of October. Commission officials say 
they are using Britain's "exemplary" decimalisation in 1971 as a 
model for a single currency. 
  A large stumbling block is, however, the slow recovery from 
recession. Sluggish economic performance and rising government 
borrowing and debt levels have seriously impeded EU states' 
ability to fulfil some of the most important "convergence 
criteria" set down at Maastricht to determine countries' 
eligibility to take part in EMU. 
  The treaty lays down four numerical criteria determining 
countries' EMU suitability, concerning inflation rates, budget 
deficits, interest rates and debt levels. No EU [European 
Union] state last year fulfilled all four criteria, although 
five -- France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the UK 
-- satisfied three of them. 
  For watchers of the Maastricht criteria, Germany is a worry. 
Germany satisfied only two of the criteria last year, and German 
public sector debt will exceed the target of 60 percent of GDP 
in 1995 because of extra debt stemming from German unification. 
  Even for some low inflation countries, rigid adherence to 
the 
Maastricht debt targets will be very difficult. 
  An analysis by Belgium's Finance Ministry shows Belgium 
would 
need a primary budget surplus (the budgetary balance before 
interest charges) of 6 percent of GDP a year for the next 15 
years to reduce public sector debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2009. 
  The Maastricht Treaty does allow for a liberal 
interpretation 
of whether member states comply with the criteria. Countries 
deemed as tackling their deficits seriously would have a chance 
of joining EMU if they can prove that their public finances are 
moving in the desired direction. 
  But to supporters of EMU, Belgium remains a natural 
candidate 
for a "hard core" currency club, despite its high government 
debt. This point was made in Paris last month by Mr Alain 
Lamassoure, the French minister for European affairs, who said 
forcefully the convergence criteria had to be "complemented by 
political considerations." 
  Public statements like this however, can be 
counter-productive. In the light of public worries in Germany 
about the replacement of the D-Mark by a European currency, 
politicians in Germany are allergic to suggestions that the 
convergence criteria could be diluted. 
  In a ruling firmly backed by the Bonn government, the German 
constitutional court laid down last October that EMU could go 
ahead only on the basis of strict adherence to the criteria. 
One senior German politician says in private: "Anyone who 
thinks he can circumvent them (the criteria) by political 
considerations will have to go before our High Court" -- a sign 
of the political battles over EMU in store.

<F P=106> [Samuel Brittan article: "Single Currency Rises Again"] </F>
  [Text] Most UK proponents of a European Union [EU] 
referendum are studiously vague on what should be asked and 
when. The merger of sterling into a common European currency 
would, on the other hand, be the type of constitutional change 
justifying a referendum, not now, but at the time it was 
proposed. UK ministers are, moreover, deceiving themselves if 
they believe that the issue has conveniently gone away, as it 
seemed it might have done a few months ago. 
  At the beginning of August 1993, the old 2.25 percent 
exchange rate mechanism [ERM] grid succumbed to a speculative 
attack. An emergency meeting of finance ministers widened the 
grid to 15 percent on either side of the central parities. This 
was so broad as to constitute virtually freely floating rates. 
The Euro-sceptics could hardly restrain their joy. The 
derailment of the ERM would, they hoped, put paid to the more 
ambitious European Monetary Union [EMU] project. 
  But then a strange thing happened. The French Government did 
not take advantage of its freedom from ERM constraints to slash 
interest rates, but continued to follow the Bundesbank lead. 
And the franc, instead of diving like sterling and the lira 
after they left the ERM, recovered. It re-entered the old grid 
at the beginning of last December and has not strayed far from 
it since. The fundamentals of a better-than-German inflation 
performance reasserted themselves over the instant cynicism of 
the currency markets. 
  A similar story with minor variations applies to the other 
`core' members of the ERM, including the Belgian-Luxembourg 
franc and the Danish krone. The Netherlands guilder has 
remained within even narrower limits. And the Austrian 
schilling -- technically outside the ERM -- has remained close 
to the D-Mark. 
  There is room for argument about whether the French and 
other 
governments were right to stick so long within the narrow ERM 
bands without a realignment in view of the long period of high 
German interest rates. But having kept to the policy during the 
most difficult period, it would be an unnecessary sacrifice of 
counter-inflationary credibility -- as well as of wider 
political aims -- to abandon the D-Mark related policy now, just 
when German interest rates are approaching levels with which 
neighbours can live. 
  It is worth noting that, although the UK was able to cut 
interest rates early as a result of leaving the ERM, British 
short-term rates are now no lower than French or German ones; 
and long-term rates are 1-1.5 percentage points higher -- the 
market's verdict on the credibility of a go-it-alone policy 
without an independently accountable central bank. 
  Where do we go from here? An EU summit has to decide not 
later than December 31, 1996 whether a majority of member states 
fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single 
currency. 
  The summit can fix a date for EMU [economic and monetary 
union] at any time during 1997 and 1998. If, however, a date 
has not been set by the end of 1997, "the third stage (ie EMU) 
shall start on January 1 1999." Another summit, voting by 
qualified majority, will decide which members fulfil the 
necessary conditions. There is no minimum number. Conditions 
which EMU participants must satisfy are: 

  -  A rate of 
inflation "close to that of the three best performing 
states"; 
  -  Convergence of long-term interest rates; 
  -  A "sustainable 
government financial position"; 
  -  The observance of "the normal 
fluctuation margins" of the ERM "for at least two years without 
devaluing against the currency of any other member state." 
  The two EU countries with the lowest inflation rate are 
France and Ireland with a rate of less than 2 percent a year. 
The UK, Belgium and Luxembourg tie for third position with 2.3 
percent, followed by Germany with 3.2 percent and the 
Netherlands with 3.9 percent. The convergence of long-term bond 
yields has gone even further for the core countries, where they 
stand at about 6.5-7 percent. 
  The fiscal guidelines appear the most troublesome. A 
Maastricht protocol mentions a budget deficit limit of 3 percent 
of gross domestic product and a debt ratio not exceeding 60 
percent. Only Luxembourg and Ireland fulfilled the deficit 
criteria last year. The Bundesbank is particularly keen on these 
criteria, and would be unlikely to recommend giving up the 
D-Mark if they were too obviously flouted. Nevertheless the 
Maastricht Treaty itself provides (Article 104c) escape 
provisions if the excess deficit is "exceptional and temporary" 
or if the excess is declining. 
  The central condition remains the final one about exchange 
rate behaviour. The Treaty says nothing about the narrow 2.25 
percent band. Thus, theoretically, members could declare the 
present 15 percent margins to be the normal ones. But it is 
inconceivable they will move to EMU if market exchange rates are 
fluctuating throughout the wide band. 
  The French and the other governments are not disposed to 
tempt fate by re-entering a narrow official ERM grid in the 
foreseeable future. What they are doing is to commit an even 
greater crime in Euro-sceptic eyes -- namely shadowing the 
D-Mark. This means that in the face of a determined currency 
attack there will be no firm floor for the speculators to aim 
at, and there could be temporary dips, such as that in the last 
few months of 1993. But monetary policy will be conducted with 
the aim of keeping currencies near to the D-Mark. 
  If the inner group currencies remain de facto close to their 
central rates, the governments concerned may move directly to 
monetary union, bypassing the narrow ERM stage. This route has 
been envisaged for these countries by, among others, Eddie 
George, Bank of England governor. 
  The crucial step provided for in the Maastricht treaty is 
for the participating governments to declare their parities 
"irrevocably fixed." After that and a good deal of preparation 
-- existing currencies would be replaced by the ECU. 
  Such developments would not be entertained until the 
European 
Union is clearly out of recession and German unification no 
longer distorts policy. Some governments might then want to 
move quickly while conditions remain right, and before too many 
other countries had joined Italy in acquiring Euro-sceptics in 
important government posts. 
  To those who are neither federalists nor nationalists the 
relevant questions are clear enough. A single currency means a 
single monetary policy tailored to the average needs of the EU 
as a whole, just as Federal Reserve policy is designed for 
average U.S. conditions rather than the particular needs of 
California or New England. Would the advantages in reduced 
uncertainty and transaction costs outweigh the disadvantages of 
not being able to follow a monetary policy adapted (within 
limits) to the needs of particular parts of Europe? And what 
would be the gain for countries of doubtful counter-inflationary 
credibility -- as the UK still is -- from substituting a 
European currency under a European Central Bank [ECB] modelled 
on the Bundesbank for its own? It would also be necessary to 
cast a weather eye on the likelihood of the new ECB being just 
as vigilant to avoid contractionary movements of nominal demand 
as of rising inflation. 
  And finally, if EMU is going to go ahead in any case, what 
would be the downside risk to the UK of staying outside? Not 
necessarily the same as it would be for Switzerland or small 
Southeast Asian economies without a currency anchor. These are 
the questions which need to replace the futile UK debate on the 
Conservative leadership.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "South Africa-Italy: End to </F>
Sanctions Boosts Italian Exports"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 9 -- The dropping of trade 
sanctions against South Africa and the devaluation of the lira 
are behind the growth in Italy's business with the 
post-apartheid state, according to statistics for the first 11 
months of 1992-93 published by the Institute for the Promotion 
of Foreign Trade (ICE). 
  Imports show a modest increase of 4.7 percent, up from 2,887 
billion lire (1,804 million dollars) to 3,004 billion lire 
(1,877.5 million dollars), while exports to South Africa show a 
healthier growth trend of 35.7 percent, going from 679 billion 
lire (424.38 million dollars) to 921 billion lire (575.63 
million dollars). 
  Overall, there was an improvement of 30.6 percent in the 
Italian balance of trade with South Africa, with predictions for 
the coming year looking positive especially for Italian exports. 
  The following table compares Jan-Nov '93 exports to South 
Africa with the same period in '92.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- According to government spokesman 
Dieter Vogel, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to the 
Federal Republic, which ends today, confirms the good and 
cooperative relations between the countries both in its course 
and its outcome. The Russian side appreciated Germany's efforts 
to include Russia in the West's security and economic 
cooperation, Vogel said in Bonn today. Russia's inclusion in 
NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative is already "well under 
way," and the extension of the leading G-7 industrial countries 
to include Russia will continue, initially politically and later 
economically. 
  The issue of bidding farewell to the [Russian] troops, on 
which there has been heated public debate in both countries, was 
one problem that was "speedily resolved in the spirit of mutual 
understanding." Before a cultural function in Weimar there will 
now be an official farewell ceremony for the troops in Berlin.

  [Text] The diplomats remain hopeful of finding a political 
solution to the Bosnian crisis. Alain Juppe met Bill Clinton 
this afternoon, and will be in Geneva tomorrow for the meeting 
between the American, Russian, and European foreign ministers. 
Having said yesterday that the French UN soldiers would not 
spend another winter in Bosnia, Juppe today said that he 
believed dialogue could still overcome the violence. He was 
speaking to our Washington correspondent, Philippe Reltien: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] I hope that for the first time, the 
great powers concerned with finding a solution to the crisis in 
Bosnia will be able to speak with one voice. Which voice will 
that be? It is still too early to say at present, but it 
appears that an agreement is being drawn out along the following 
lines: an urgent appeal to the warring parties for a cease-fire, 
and a general and immediate cessation of hostilities across the 
whole of Bosnia for several months. Secondly, it must be 
repeated that Bosnia is an independent state within its borders, 
and it is a member of the United Nations. Thirdly, it must be 
noted that within Bosnia-Herzegovina, there are several 
communities which want to have the power to administer 
themselves, and in fact the Croat-Muslim accord is proof of 
this. Finally, we would like to have certain indications as to 
the distribution of territories between these different 
communities. 
  I have the impression when I read the correspondence we have 
received on this subject from both the Russians and the 
Americans that the limits set out in the European Union action 
plan -- that is 51 percent for the Croats and the Muslims on one 
side, and 49 percent for the Serbs - could form the basis of an 
accord. I certainly hope so. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Tino Oldani and Renzo Rosati: "A Comprehensive </F>
Map of the New Government"] 
  [Text] Berlusconi's, Bossi's, and Fini's people, and those 
of the opposing alliances. Here is an initial "who's who" of the 
Second Republic. 
  Initially, Irene Pivetti was expected to become 
leader in the Chamber of Deputies and Carlo 
Scognamiglio in the Senate, but now--with the cabinet being 
formed, and given the alternation in every area that the 
principles of alternation require--the presence of new faces and 
unexpected personages promises, in a sense, to become the rule 
rather than the exception during this transition from the First 
Republic to the Second. Within a few weeks the pictures of a 
defeated (and often not excessively old) nomenklatura will 
disappear from the Palazzo walls and be replaced by the 
definitely younger faces of the victors--of a smiling 
Silvio Berlusconi, a sullen Umberto Bossi, 
and a stern Gianfranco Fini. This will attest to the 
fact that the advent of the new political class is accompanied 
by a revolution that even has an anthropological aspect and 
seems destined to lay siege--in concentric circles--to the 
entire hierarchy of power in the public administration, the 
banks, industry and finance, the press and television, the 
judiciary, and the police. 
  A downright morbid curiosity has developed with respect to 
the selection of the new key figures in the government, 
beginning with the ministers who will be part of a still 
hypothetical Berlusconi cabinet. All the newspapers constructed 
and published--over a period of days--their own hypothetical 
organization charts. Were these lists either right or wrong? The 
leader of Forza Italia has dismissed them with the comment, 
"They are fantasies." In his opinion, these lists of cabinet 
ministers were wrong on two counts. First, they appeared to have 
been compiled using the Cencelli manual and a logic--based on a 
new version of the patronage system--that the Knight 
[Berlusconi] finds intolerable; moreover, they did not at all 
have either the appearance or the substance of an administration 
of the Milan [Berlusconi's soccer club] type, that is to say, a 
victorious administration composed of outstanding individuals, 
which is his supreme desire. "Organizing a good team will take 
time," Berlusconi cautioned, "all the time that is necessary." 
His words surprised no one who is aware of Berlusconi's 
convictions and of his modus operandi. 
  Berlusconi is a tenacious advocate of the free-market 
economic theory known as "self-fulfilling prophecies" [preceding 
two words in English], that is to say, "prophecies that become 
true by dint of believing them." It is a principle that when 
translated into action means setting for oneself, from time to 
time, a great strategic objective--a goal that is increasingly 
ambitious--and then striving with all one's energies and those 
of one's team solely to attain it. From all appearances, this is 
also the way Berlusconi built his fortune: first with the model 
urban districts, then as a TV entrepreneur, then as a publisher, 
and finally as president of the Milan soccer club. 
  If this is the logic employed, one can understand why 
Berlusconi wants only outstanding individuals for his cabinet, 
chosen freely as provided for by the Constitution. An example? 
His most ambitious goal is to convince Antonio Di 
Pietro--the magistrate most beloved by the Italians--to 
accept the post of interior minister. Although the initial 
indications in response were not encouraging, Berlusconi has not 
given up. Is Di Pietro too heavily involved in the final stages 
of the Cusani trial? No problem: the Knight immediately made it 
known that the government will not be formed overnight. His 
principal supporter in making this choice is Fini, who has 
always maintained good relations with the judge, who is the 
symbol of Operation Clean Hands. For this reason Giuseppe 
Tatarella, one of the leaders of the National Alliance 
[AN], took the field with an explicit invitation: "Di Pietro," 
he says, "is one of the founding fathers of the Second Republic, 
and we are now asking him to help build it. It is a choice that 
should be made from the perspective of history rather than that 
of the daily news columns." 
  While waiting for a "yes" from Di Pietro, the Knight has 
already obtained one from from two high-ranking civil servants: 
Lamberto Dini, general manager of the Bank of Italy, 
and Andrea Monorchio, the government's chief 
accountant. The post of treasury minister awaits Dini, who is 
perhaps better known and esteemed abroad than in Italy (before 
joining the board of directors of the central bank--where his 
relations with Carlo Azeglio Ciampi have been difficult--he was 
for almost 20 years an IMF executive). This was confirmed on 
several occasions by Dini himself in recent discussions with his 
European colleagues in St. Petersburg during the meeting of the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The only 
obstacle which could derive from the economic program that the 
government coalition plans to implement. "There must not be even 
the smallest recrudescence of an inflationary spiral," Dini 
said. "Otherwise, I will never accept." 
  Dini's appointment, however, can be viewed as a certainty, 
to 
judge from certain programmatic suggestions that Dini himself 
has made to his interlocutors. First, complete disclosure of the 
actual accounts of the state, where the gap left by the Ciampi 
administration is reportedly much greater than the official 
figures. Second, the immediate resumption investment in major 
public works projects and simultaneous simplification of the 
attendant procedures. For example, a model for granting 
concessions that has been successful in the United States could 
be adopted in Italy: namely, allowing the firm that carries out 
a public works project to profit from its operation for a period 
of 30 years before it is transferred to the state. This model 
could be applied--in conjunction with a large-scale mobilization 
of private savings--to two major projects: a high-speed railroad 
system, with a spin-off of 50,000 new jobs, and a bridge over 
the Strait of Messina--an infrastructure that could virtually 
ensure to the Berlusconi administration its place in history. 
  A novice in politics, Berlusconi in recent days has made no 
secret of the fact that he is also somewhat lacking in expertise 
in bureaucratic matters. And because the reorganization of the 
office of prime minister allocated great powers to what had 
previously been merely the government's "chief notarial office," 
this particular shortcoming of his must be remedied forthwith. 
Within the Knight's entourage the word is that the best solution 
would be the appointment of Andrea Monorchio as 
secretary-general to the office of prime minister, inasmuch as 
Monorchio is esteemed not only for his levelheadedness but above 
all for his exceptional knowledge of the actual accounts of the 
state. Berlusconi reportedly would like to appoint Gianni 
Letta, vice president of Fininvest Communications and his 
longtime political adviser, to serve with him in Palazzo Chigi 
[office of the prime minister] in a role of institutional 
importance and trust (i.e., undersecretary to the office of the 
prime minister). The appointment--which Letta has attempted 
gracefully to avoid and which has also reportedly elicited some 
resistance on the part of Fedele Confalonieri, who is reluctant 
to deprive himself of a key executive of the firm--has already 
been submitted to the legal experts for an analysis of all 
possible implications, inasmuch as Letta is in fact not a member 
of parliament, although this would appear not to be an obstacle. 
If it proves to be, Letta could be given a different post: for 
example, that of first private secretary to the prime minister. 
  With Dini on board, the troika of economic ministers will 
probably be rounded out by the appointment of Giulio 
Tremonti as finance minister and Giancarlo 
Pagliarini as budget minister (the ministry was explicitly 
requested by the Northern League). Although Tremonti was elected 
on Mario Segni's Pact [Patto] ticket, he has never shared 
Segni's stubborn position that led the referendum leader [Segni] 
to side with the opposition to the Knight. Indeed, Tremonti's 
federalist theories on taxation--which came to light at an 
unexpected moment--make him a valuable hinge for linking 
together the allies of the Freedom Alliance with a view to 
reconciling the federalism that the League insists should apply 
even to tax matters, on the one hand, with the drastic reduction 
of the IRPEI [personal income tax] rate that Forza Italia and 
the AN are requesting. 
  Nothing has been decided with respect to the other so-called 
series a cabinet ministries (such as foreign affairs, defense, 
justice, and posts), despite the numerous organization charts 
provided by the newspapers. A poll conducted by Gianni 
Pilo's Diakron (to which Berlusconi has always paid close 
attention) disclosed that Italians would like to see in the 
government--in addition to Di Pietro--prominent individuals such 
as Gianni Agnelli, Romano Prodi, and Umberto 
Veronesi. To take this poll into account would mean wiping 
out the hopes of many aspiring ministerial candidates, 
especially those who are closest to Berlusconi. Indeed, the 
League and the AN are unlikely to renounce their goal of 
restructuring their representation in the executive branch. 
  Change will come not only to the government, however. Among 
the nerve centers of power that will be effected by change are 
the banking and financial system, which has always been of 
strategic importance. No one has any doubts as to who the 
victors are in this sector. The first is Enrico 
Cuccia, 84 years of age, the honorary president of 
Mediobanca [Financial Credit Bank], listed by many observers two 
or three years ago as among the losers, inasmuch as the 
separation of Mediobanca from Comit [Italian Commercial Bank] 
and Credit [Italian Credit Bank] threatened to shut off the 
financial spigots that had always enabled him to carry out his 
projects. But the "little man of steel" did not lose heart: he 
devised a strategy for the reconquest of Comit and Credit, and 
in spite of his most tenacious adversary--IRI [Institute for 
Industrial Reconstruction] President Romano Prodi--he succeeded 
in reconquering them, thanks to privatization. The result is 
almost incredible: Mediobanca is today the most authoritative 
and credible hinge linking the old and the new--between an old 
in which the only ones who counted were the great families under 
Cuccia's care, and a new in which--thanks to the privatization 
of the public banks--certain entrepreneurs who have become 
prominent stockholders of Credit and Comit are coming on stage, 
such as Diego Della Valle, Leonardo Del Vecchio, Steno 
Marcegaglia, Lionello Adler, and Vito 
Gnutti--the latter wearing two hats, the one of an 
entrepreneur-stockholder in Credit and the other of a League 
deputy who is being considered for a post in the cabinet. This 
list can be enlarged to include the leaders of the small and 
medium-sized manufacturers who took part in the recent 
convention of the Verona chapter of Confindustria [General 
Confederation of Italian Industry]: leading figures such as 
Massimo Zanetti and Paolo Rovagnati, or 
Giorgio Panto, who is working on Project Azzurro 
[Blue], an association that will be an alternative to the old 
Confindustria nomenklatura. 
  Other events serve to confirm the fact that Mediobanca has 
again become the crossroads of the nation's financial activity. 
After years of incommunicability, Fininvest--of which Berlusconi 
is still the owner--has entrusted Cuccia's people with the 
Mondadori sale. And Maurizio Gasparri, the AN's chief 
economic adviser, has asked the government to give greater 
consideration to those banking operations that relate to the 
divestitures and specifically those of Mediobanca, which alleges 
that it has heretofore been placed at a disadvantage vis-a-vis 
the foreign merchant banks [preceding two words in English]. 
  The list of victorious bankers includes the names--in 
addition to Cuccia's--of Mediobanca's allies, and in particular 
those of Luigi Fausti of Comit; Lucio 
Rondelli, back in the saddle at Credit; and 
Pellegrino Capaldo and Cesare Geronzi of 
the Bank of Rome. As for the losers--who had bet on an election 
victory of the center-left coalition--many of them are pointing 
the finger at Giovanni Bazoli, president of the Sao 
Paolo Bank of Brescia. "When Berlusconi entered politics," his 
enemies say resentfully, "Bazoli's initial reaction was to 
demand that the loans made to Fininvest be called." 
  Some are predicting the triumphal return to Via 
Filodrammatici [Mediobanca headquarters] of Antonio 
Maccanico--undersecretary to the office of the prime 
minister during the Ciampi administration--who would replace 
Francesco Cingano as the bank's president, a post he previously 
held. Some say that among those making this prediction is 
Maurizio Romiti, a top manager [preceding word in 
English] at Mediobanca, who is regarded as one of the most 
unenthusiastic supporters of the theory that his father [Cesare 
Romiti]--the managing director at FIAT -- should be dragged in 
to fill the post. In Milan, a rumor is making the rounds of the 
more important suites to the effect that Cesare 
Romiti--after having for 15 years had a major impact on the 
operations of FIAT -- is about to hand over the controls at 
Corso Marconi [FIAT headquarters] to Paolo 
Cantarella--a generational change that for Romiti senior 
should not at all mean retirement, for rumor says that as an 
alternative to the Mediobanca job, he could become president of 
Montedison. 
  A shock wave is also expected to hit the sector of the 
state-owned enterprises, foremost among which are the IRI 
[Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] and the ENI [National 
Hydrocarbons Corporation]. A particular Chinese metaphor is 
popular with the Freedom Alliance, to wit: It does not matter 
what color a cat is; the important thing is that it catch the 
mice. As if to say: Let no preconceived policy be applied to 
capable managers, provided they agree to implement the 
government program. IRI President Romano Prodi, however, has 
already decided to resign as soon as the new government takes 
office; then, if he is invited to remain, he will weigh the pros 
and cons. ENI Managing Director Franco Bernabe will 
in all probability do likewise. Meanwhile, there are those who 
venture to predict who the new strong men will be: Lorenzo 
Necci, the lord of high-speed transportation, a key element 
in the future government program; former IRI Vice President 
Pietro Armani, author of the AN's economic program, 
who has been mentioned for the top post at STET [Turin Telephone 
Finance Company]; Ernesto Pascale, candidate for the 
top post at Telecom Italia; Fabiano Fabiani, whose 
diligent performance in the construction of the new Finmeccanica 
[Mechanical Engineering Finance Corporation] was judged 
favorably by the League; IRI General Manager Enrico 
Micheli and Vincenzo Dettori, who distinguished 
themselves in connection with the privatization already carried 
out by the IRI; Renato Cassaro of Fintecna, an expert 
practicioner of downsizing; and Roberto Schisano, who 
became managing director of Alitalia following a successful 
career with Texas Instruments. And there are those who predict 
that one of the present ENI managers [preceding word in 
English]--Carlo Da Molo, formerly of Italgas [Italian 
Gas Company]--will be recycled. 
  On the labor union front, hard times are predicted for the 
top leadership respectively of the CGIL [Italian General 
Confederation of Labor], CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade 
Unions], and UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions], all of 
whom before the election were committed opponents of the Freedom 
Alliance. On the launching pad, however, is the ISA [expansion 
not given], a new federation that groups together 10 independent 
unions--headed by CISNAL [Italian Confederation of National 
Trade Unions], CISAL [Italian Confederation of Independent Trade 
Unions], CIMO [Italian Confederation of Hospital Doctors], 
CONFSAL [Confederation of Autonomous Trade Unions], and DIRSTAL 
[National Association of Executives of the Civil Service])--with 
a total membership of 6 million and new leaders [preceding word 
in English]: Gaetano Cerioli, Mauro Nobilia, and 
Rosy Mauro. 
  In spite of those who for years have been writing him off, 
the position of the chief of police, Vincenzo Parisi, 
is deemed to be "static." Working in his favor are reportedly 
not only his friendship with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro but 
also his thorough knowledge of the intelligence services, with 
whose top officials the progressive coalition had developed 
positive relations during the Ciampi administration but 
conflictual relations with Parisi himself. 
  Last but not least [preceding four words in English], there 
is the political chapter that is perhaps the most sensitive of 
all: the press and TV. The new antitrust [preceding word in 
English] law--which has been invoked by several parties--will 
bring profound changes that no one is able to foresee. Many, 
however, are predicting the departure from the scene of 
Eugenio Scalfari--just turned 70--the most famous of 
the newspaper editors who lined up with the progressives and the 
center. Some even indicate 1 September as the date of his 
departure and Ezio Mauro--currently the editor in 
chief of STAMPA--as his most likely successor.

  1. Roberto Maroni, 39. Lawyer in Varese. Cofounder 
of the League together with Bossi. Served as municipal 
councilman and subsequently as a member of the Chamber of

  [Text] In Italy, Prime Minister Berlusconi has said that 
the neofascist ministers in his government should not be 
regarded as such, but rather as men of the Center-Right, or even 
the Center-Left. This does not seem to be the opinion of the 
deputy leader of the neofascist party, which held a meeting 
yesterday, and which has not given up its attachment to the 
memory of Mussolini. Alain de Chalvron is in Rome: 
  [de Chalvron] Scarcely had the government been put together 
when the neofascists of the MSI [Italian Social Movement] 
gathered for a little meeting to prepare for the European 
elections. The hardliners were here: the guest of honor was Pino 
Rauti, the party's second in command, previously the leader, 
removed by Fini. For him, and for all the others there, there 
should be no false modesty: 
  [Begin Rauti recording] We are the defenders of values that 
existed before fascism, and during fascism, and they have the 
right to exist after fascism. These are the values that we 
fought for. The (?youngest people) in the post-fascist period, I 
myself in the fascist period, in the last phase of the war, in 
the Italian social republic [sentence as heard]. The battle is 
one over values and spirituality, rather than over the economic 
aspects of life and existence. 
  The defense of the family, the defense of (?the faith), the 
defense of traditional values -- many things. I don't think all 
of this was perfect in the fascist regime, but nevertheless it 
was a trend (?to be defended). 
  The doctrine of fascism is not dictatorship. Dictatorship 
was a necessity of the other postwar period; it was the 
personality of Mussolini; there was the great world crisis after 
the economic crisis in the United States, and many things that 
made fascism an authoritarian phenomenon. [end recording] 
  [de Chalvron] With all due respect to Fini, the great 
burnisher of the MSI's image, and to Berlusconi who is saying 
today that his allies are by no means neofascists, there is 
certainly a whole tendency within the National Alliance which 
looks back to the past and is proud of it.

  [Text] Russia intends to undertake an initiative to begin a 
new process to promote a Cyprus solution. Foreign Minister 
Alekos Mikhailidhis will visit Moscow in early June for further 
talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. The 
possibility of Russia's undertaking an initiative follows 
statements made after a meeting today between Mikhailidhis and 
Russian Foreign Ministry envoys Feliks Bogdanov and Pyotr 
Dobroserdov. 
  Bogdanov said that Russia is not indifferent to developments 
in the Cyprus issue and added that, on the basis of the briefing 
they received during their visit to Cyprus, Russia will 
formulate its position to contribute to the beginning of a 
process to promote a just solution of the problem. He also 
noted that when the Cypriot and Russian foreign ministers meet 
in Moscow they will discuss the whole situation in detail. 
Mikhailidhis will visit the Russian capital on 5 June. 
Bogdanov further said that the basis for a solution to the 
problem exists. He said: There are the relevant UN 
resolutions, the UN secretary general's set of ideas, and the 
confidence-building measures. 
  Asked about the possibility of convening an international 
conference, the Russian official said that this proposal exists 
as an idea but that the topics should be considered collectively 
together with other ideas and proposals. 
  At their meeting with Mikhailidhis, the two Russian 
officials 
conveyed an invitation from Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev to visit Moscow. 
  Mikhailidhis described the talks with the Russian officials 
as very useful and noted that the Cyprus issue and its 
developments will prevail at the Moscow talks. At the same time 
bilateral relations and other international issues will also be 
discussed. Referring to Russia's increasing interest in 
strengthening its relations with Cyprus as well as that 
country's constructive and positive role, Mikhailidhis said that 
he expects there will be some specific agreements during his 
visit to the Russian capital. 
  The Russian officials also had a meeting with acting 
President Alexis Galanos. Afterward Galanos described the visit 
as very significant and added that it demonstrates the Russian 
Government's interest in Cyprus. He said: Russia's interest 
and possible thoughts of an international conference give a 
broader dimension to the Cyprus problem and stress its 
international aspect, namely, that basically it is an issue of 
invasion and occupation.

  [Text] At dawn today unidentified people set fire to a car 
belonging to the YSEE [Greek General Confederation of Labor] in 
Aryiroupolis. The car, which was parked at the junction of 
Trapezounda and Olimbia Streets, was destroyed. The 
Revolutionary Violence Cells [Pirines Epanastatkis Vias] claimed 
responsibility for the car's arson in a telephone call to a 
private radio station. 
  A YSEE statement described the arson as a provocative action 
aimed at disorientating the working people. The statement 
condemned the unseen elements, who, with their suspicious and 
evil presence, have again tried to open a front against the 
trade unions--and this on the day of the May Day observances.

  [Excerpt] London, May 12 (A.A.) -- A Turkish delegation 
headed by Bilgin Unan, Foreign Ministry deputy under secretary, 
is holding contacts in London in an effort to find a solution to 
the corrosion problem facing the Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline. 
  Unan said during his meetings with officials from the 
British 
Foreign Ministry that he was told the British Government would 
help Turkey in its economic problems. 
  "Britain has realized the importance of the issue for 
Turkey, 
specially economically. British officials have told us `we 
shall help the Turkish economy as much as we can,'" he said. 
  Inan stressed that Turkey is looking for a solution to the 
problem that would not violate the UN embargo on Iraq. 
  "We are asking our allies who are in the UN Security Council 
to help us in solving this issue and understanding our problem. 
Our trade relations with Iraq have ceased because of the 
embargo and our losses following the closure of the pipeline 
have already reached 5 billion dollars," he said. 
  He said his contacts face-to-face with officials of the 
British Foreign Ministry were very useful, adding the flushing 
operation of the pipeline will allow for 12 million barrels of 
oil and the sale of this will bring a modest contribution to 
Turkey's economy while it will bring some humanitarian help 
products to Iraq. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The United States, Russia, and Europe adopted a 
common stance in Geneva yesterday to bring peace to Bosnia. In 
Geneva yesterday, the foreign ministers of these countries gave 
the belligerents two weeks to resume peace negotiations. They 
urged them to conclude an agreement on the basis of the 
territorial compromise reached earlier, which gave 51 percent of 
Bosnian territory to the Muslims and the Croats and 49 percent 
to the Serbs. Can we expect any results from yesterday's 
meeting? Was there any progress in the search for a solution to 
the problem? Without hesitation, French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe told Christophe Blondeau that the answer is yes. 
  [Begin Juppe recording] This is the first time that Russian, 
U.S., and European foreign ministers have met, not to issue 
vague statements, but to agree on certain precise points. 
Second, there is the content of the declaration. We called on 
the parties to cease hostilities completely, as soon as 
possible. This means the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the 
deployment of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] buffer forces. 
Then we drew up the outlines of a political agreement: the 
preservation of the unity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, institutional 
arrangements between the different communities, so each can 
administer itself freely, and territorial compromise, with 51 
percent for the Croat-Muslim federation and 49 percent for the 
Serbian entity. Finally, in the event of this being accepted 
and signed -- and not only signed, but implemented -- that is, 
if the the Serbs withdrew from the parts of the Bosnian 
territory they should evacuate, then we could envisage the start 
of a progressive suspension of sanctions. We now have to obtain 
the agreement of the parties. This will be the task of the 
contact group, which will start its work as from tomorrow. [end

  [Text] Geneva, May 13 (AFP) -- UN High Commissioner for 
Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso made an impassioned plea Friday 
[13 May] for the world to end the "unimaginable human tragedy" 
in Rwanda. 
  "The world must do something to halt this violence," said 
Ayala Lasso, who arrived in Europe Thursday from five days in 
Kigali, where he met with the chiefs of the Hutu-led government 
army and the mostly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
  He obtained assurances from the government army that several 
thousand civilians held captive in the capital would be freed 
soon. 
  He said he had asked the warring parties to guarantee the 
safe delivery of humanitarian aid, but added: "the 
international community must really commit itself to putting 
pressure on this country." 
  Ayala Lasso said the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis had 
both welcomed his proposal to set up a commission to determine 
the causes of the massacres which have left some 200,000 dead in 
the tiny highland central African state, and responsibility for 
them. 
  The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
meanwhile 
said that with U.S. planes now operating an airbridge taking aid 
to some 250,000 Rwandan refugees in Tanzania had intensified, 
and was flying in plastic sheeting for shelters. 
  Some 2,000 refugees are continuing to cross the border each 
day, said spokesman Ron Redmond. 
  In Paris, Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said 
France had asked the United Nations to ensure that UN troops in 
Rwanda protect refugees sheltering in the Milles Collines Hotel 
in Kigali, saying they had been threatened. 
  France supported a proposal by UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali for beefing up the UN troop strength in Rwanda, he 
said, and it appeared the warring parties had agreed to this. 
  Theogene Rudasingwa, the secretary general of the Patriotic 
Front, meanwhile told a press conference in Johannesburg that he 
was "shocked" that France should refuse to support "the real 
democratic forces of the Rwandan opposition" rather than the 
government, which was behind the "massacre of the Tutsis."

  [Text] The Dutch minister for overseas development, Jan 
Pronk, has called for aid to be airlifted to Rwanda to provide 
food for the hundreds of thousands of refugees there. 
  Mr. Pronk made his appeal shortly after visiting the Rwandan 
capital, Kigali. The minister called on the United States to 
take the lead in organizing the airlifts. He also called for 
the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to protect 
relief convoys. 
  After his visit to Kigali, Mr. Pronk compared the situation 
in Rwanda with the killing fields of Cambodia, where huge 
numbers of Cambodia's population were slaughtered in a civil war.

<F P=106> [Guy Daloze report: "Europe: A Dehaene-Lubbers Duel"] </F>
  [Text] If they do not have the same silhouette, then at 
least they have the same political profile. They are both 
Christian Democrats, both leaders of a small European Union [EU] 
country, and both prime ministers (incoming or outgoing). In 
addition, the European Community headhunters are definitely at a 
loss six weeks before the Corfu Summit on 24 and 25 June, at 
which the name of the future president of the European 
Commission will be made known -- unless it is postponed. 
<H5>  British Veto </H5>
  So, will it be the Belgian Dehaene, or the Netherlander 
Lubbers? A reliable source has confirmed that the current 
occupant of 16 rue de la Loi [Belgian prime minister's office] 
is unofficially the official candidate of the French and 
Germans, who saluted his performance as a "problem solver" 
during the Belgian presidency and see in him a voluntarist and 
pragmatic leader for the Europe of tomorrow. 
  However, there is a hitch: Jean-Luc Dehaene, the European 
federalist, is running up against the British veto. In London 
they would be happy with a last-ditch stand in favor of Sir Leon 
Brittan, but there is already discreet support for Mr. Lubbers 
in political circles. Mr. Major greatly appreciated the support 
of the Netherlands outgoing prime minister, who is just as much 
a free- trader as himself, during the Netherlands EU presidency 
and the Maastricht Treaty. 
<H5>  Back To The Belgians </H5>
  The confrontation will also have to take national 
contingencies into account. Ruud Lubbers has officially 
announced his candidacy and is available since the Netherlands 
voters showed him the way out two weeks ago. As for Jean-Luc 
Dehaene, he is keeping his silence and having a lot more trouble 
freeing himself from his national career. He knows that he is 
the federalizing cement in the government. Moreover, his 
partners, while they do not want to deprive him of a prestigious 
European career, are nevertheless drawing his attention -- 
especially in the CVP [Flemish People's Party] and the PS 
[Flemish Socialist Party] -- to the risks which his departure 
could have for the coalition, if not the country. As a result, 
Wilfried Martens said his former chief of staff's accession to 
the EU presidency would be "problematic." 
  The same discreet contacts between social christians and 
socialists these past few weeks have, however, confirmed the 
common desire to go all the way to the end of the legislative 
session (end of 1995), and to do so even if the "affairs" 
[reference to scandals involving the SP] lead to new 
disturbances. So, the search is on for a successor to Jean-Luc 
Dehaene -- just in case. Melchior Wathelet does not much feel 
like being used as a repair patch and Leo Delcroix cannot 
command unanimity within his own party. Under these conditions, 
Herman van Rompuy [budget minister] would be the most likely 
candidate, although he does not generate a great deal of 
enthusiasm. 
  Account must also be taken of Karel van Miert, the current 
Belgian European commissioner, who was promised the post during 
the government negotiations in 1992 and who will have to find a 
landing place: either in the Belgian Government (as deputy 
prime minister) or at the head of an SP which is ready to 
recover!

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Sir Leon Brittan, European trade </F>
commissioner, by Lucy Walker in Brussels; date not given] 
  [Text] The last time I met Sir Leon Brittan in his office 
at the European Commission he was extolling his "favourite 
village" -- Spennithorpe, in his sleepy rural constituency of 
Richmond in North Yorkshire -- while simultaneously outlining 
his plans to shape the then-European Community's competition 
policy. 
  Since then, he has abandoned the intricacies of competition 
policy for the international stage as the Commissioner for 
external economic relations, and moved from the asbestos-ridden 
Berlaymont into the Commission's new home, the Breydel building. 
  Sir Leon, the former British trade secretary forced to 
resign 
over the Westland helicopter scandal, has unquestionably made a 
professional success of his five and a half years in Brussels, 
and his continued enthusiasm suggests that it has been a 
personal triumph as well. 
  Billed before his arrival as little more than the prime 
minister's poodle, Sir Leon has proved his critics wrong. In 
the tradition of Britons abroad, the disgraced ex-minister went 
native early, surprising Commission staff and earning the ire of 
Margaret Thatcher, who found her poodle's bite at least as bad 
as its bark. 
  Sir Leon defends the goal of a single currency and is 
campaigning for the inclusion of minimum social laws in 
international trade agreements -- enough to leave him not only 
out of step with the British government, but dancing to an 
altogether different tune. However, it is his very nativeness 
which has made him London's choice to succeed Jacques Delors, 
who in January steps down as Commission president after ten 
years. 
  At a time when many are alarmed by a "democratic deficit" -- 
and at the horse-trading over the appointment of Delors' 
successor -- Sir Leon is sanguine. Sinking into a deep-red sofa 
in his office overlooking the Parc Cin-quantenaire, he defends 
the selection process, dismissing the notion that the president 
should be directly elected. "I think that would be a complete 
change in the balance of the institutions," he says. 
  If the European Parliament, directly elected by universal 
suffrage, is the Union's democratic anchor, the Commission is 
only the motor, and the Council of Ministers -- comprising 
representatives of member states' governments -- is both the 
brake and the throttle. 
  "It is precisely because the Commission is not a 
democratically- elected body that others are entitled to put on 
the brakes," he insists, with a hint of fatigue. Perhaps it is 
the job -- he is midway through a programme taking him to 
Moscow, Brussels and Kiev inside 48 hours -- or the rounds of 
interviews which are tiring him. 
  Sir Leon would dearly love the president's job, but he faces 
stiff competition from Ruud Lubbers, the former Dutch premier, 
and the Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. And other 
member states are nervous of a Briton in the driving seat when 
Westminster has signed up to neither a European social policy 
nor a future single currency. 
  He is anxious to play down the depth of Tory rifts, 
dismissing reports that leaving the EU [European Union] for some 
less- threatening free trade arrangement is an option now 
favoured by a Euro-sceptic minority. "I don't think there has 
been the slightest intention or desire in any serious political 
body to do this," he says. 
  There is no official campaign for the presidency. But Sir 
Leon, 54, is on the hustings, squeezing hurried interviews to 
promote his first book into his already hectic schedule, and 
there is no doubt that Europe: The Europe We Need, already 
translated into French and soon to be published in German and 
Italian, is a manifesto for Europe's most controversial job. 
Sir Leon has used its 246 pages to expound his support for a 
single currency, for the swift enlargement of the Union, and for 
more radical plans to streamline the Commission itself, turning 
the 17-member college into a cabinet- style hierarchy of senior 
and junior Commissioners. This is the nearest to a public 
debate that the contest for the appointment of a new president 
has ever come. 
  The new president, whoever it is, faces two inescapable 
priorities: reforming the EU's institutions to accommodate its 
swelling ranks -- Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway are due to 
join next year -- and laying the path for further membership to 
the east and the south. 
  Sir Leon wants swift enlargement but warns against setting 
artificial deadlines. He says there are "moral, economic and 
political" reasons, for speeding the integration of six former 
Soviet satellites, but insists that they should join on the same 
terms as existing members. The incorporation of micro-states 
such as Malta and Cyprus need not create new problems: "The 
question is not do we have them in or not, but how to 
accommodate them," he says. 
  Asking the right questions must, he says, be the priority 
for 
the next inter-governmental conference (IGC), due to start in 
1996. The last IGC which spawned the Maastricht treaty, was not 
-- as some have argued -- rushed, but it did lack direction. 
Public scepticism over Maastricht could not have been avoided 
simply by prolonging the process, and there is no reason why the 
next IGC should not be completed by the end of 1996. 
  Adamant that reforms are urgently needed to accommodate an 
EU 
of 16 or more he reasons: "We must use the IGC to decide what 
changes are needed to ensure enlargement doesn't slow down our 
capacity to act." But on whether the IGC should also tackle a 
wholesale reform of the Commission -- perhaps along the lines 
laid down in his book -- he refuses to be drawn. 
  With uncharacteristic coyness, the man who would be 
president 
declines to even hazard whether he will be given the chance to 
put his plans into practice.

<F P=106> [Report by Philip Johnston on a speech by John Major to </F>
Scottish Conservatives on 13 May: "Judge Me on My Record -- 
Major"] 
  [Text] Mr Major called on his party and the country last 
night to judge him on his record over a full Parliament, and 
allow him to fulfil the mandate he received from the electorate 
two years ago. 
  In his first set-piece speech since last week's drubbing for 
the Conservatives at the local elections, the Prime Minister 
told Scottish Tories, meeting in Inverness, that he was only 
halfway through his period in office and he intended to complete 
it. 
  His speech won him a standing ovation from party activists 
as 
he called for a revival of national self confidence and policies 
that would "unleash the genius of the nation". 
  The Prime Minister said: "Judge me on my whole term. All of 
it. You can't judge a house when only the foundations are laid." 
Earlier Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, 
tipped as a possible successor if Mr Major was forced out of 
office, urged the party to keep its nerve and allow economic 
recovery to deliver the political benefits for the Government. 
He also pledged to support Mr Major "through thick and through 
thin". 
  The speeches, after Mr John Smith's death, were shorn of the 
cross-party attacks that are a traditional feature of political 
conferences. There was also none of the ritual razzmatazz that 
normally accompanies the Tory leader's address. 
  Mr Major said there were higher things than politics. Common 
bonds of humanity united the nation. "I often have little taste 
for the politics of points-scoring, or for belittling others," 
he added. "I care passionately for what I believe in, but I 
don't care passionately for damning what other people believe in. 
  "Sometimes I feel there is too much knocking, too much 
sneering, too much setting up of Aunt Sally against Aunt Sally. 
Being negative can be an addictive drug, but like any drug it 
corrodes and destroys the body in which it exists, and one body 
it runs the risk of corrupting is the body politic of the nation 
itself." 
  Mr Major said he had come to Inverness to be positive and 
extol the successes of Government policies. These were taking 
the country out of recession, with the lowest inflation and 
interest rates for a generation. Mr Major outlined an agenda 
for the rest of the parliament that placed greater emphasis on 
improving standards of education and curbing crime. He 
signalled that the law and order reforms already introduced 
would be extended. 
  "The British people are heartily sick of the apologists for 
crime and the crackdown that is needed has only just begun," Mr 
Major said. 
  He criticised the opposition of some teachers to school 
tests, a hostility he found impossible to understand. "We need 
to sweep away the progressive dogma that has done so much 
damage. Extend parents' choice, insist on the basics, make sure 
we get the best results for every child, and see that those 
results are reported and tested." Mr Major also staged a 
powerful defence of his policy on Europe, the issue that 
continues to threaten Tory stability and unity and which he said 
was "the poison in the well of British politics". 
  With the outcome of next month's Euro-elections likely to 
renew the pressure on his leadership, he took a swipe at his own 
party's Euro-sceptics. He said the benefits to jobs and trade 
were too often missed by those who concentrated on the narrow 
arguments as though they were fighting a holy war.

<F P=106> [Report by Michel Bellemare (with AFP): "The Presence of </F>
Neofascists Worries Europe"] 
  [Excerpt] The commentaries abroad, and especially in 
France, on the new Italian Government have concentrated on 
condemning the presence of neofascist ministers in the 
Berlusconi team. 
  On Tuesday evening [10 May], during his television speech 
and 
when he did not yet know the exact number of portfolios held by 
the neofascists, French President Francois Mitterrand 
"regretted" their presence while recognizing "the Italians' 
right to choose." "The first right to be respected," he 
stressed, is that of a "people who have given large numbers of 
votes to the neofascist party. I regret it, but I recognize the 
Italians' right to choose, especially in view of the fact that 
this neofascist party does not have a majority and I do not 
think that this party can determine Italian policy." "We must," 
he concluded, "educate, advise, and speak in a friendly way to 
the Italians, and I think it is nonsensical for us to declare a 
`ban' on them." 
  This is a viewpoint which surprises Charles Millon. "I think 
Francois Mitterrand was surprisingly moderate," the chairman of 
the UDF [French Democratic Union] National Assembly group 
stressed yesterday. As a member of the Foreign Affairs 
Commission, he wants to go further: "The European Union [EU] 
was built on a scale of values and on a concept of human rights 
which refers to notions of freedom, equality, and respect for 
the individual." 
  Consequently, he "wants and demands that the Italian 
president should guarantee the Italian Government's respect for 
these values." However, like former Socialist minister Jack 
Lang, Charles Million "is not calling for the boycott or 
ostracism (of the neofascist ministers), but for respect for 
European values." 
  For his part, Dominique Baudis, head of the united UDF-RPR 
[Rally for the Republic] list for the European elections, said 
in a communique that the ministers of the other 11 EU countries 
will have to be "extremely vigilant with regard to the 
representatives of the Italian extreme Right. The entry into 
the Italian Government of neofascist representatives is an 
event, the gravity of which must be gauged." 
  While the RPR leadership remained silent on the subject, 
there were many statements at Socialist Party [PSF] headquarters 
on the "danger" presented by the presence of neofascists. Jack 
Lang, former culture minister, expressed the hope in LIBERATION 
on Tuesday that "through diplomacy, the French Government will 
make it known that the French counterparts of the neofascist 
ministers will not establish relations with them." 
Jean-Christophe Cambadelis, PSF secretary for external 
relations, yesterday called for a boycott and the establishment 
of an "exclusion zone." As for First Secretary Michel Rocard, 
he "greatly regretted that Italy has done this," but stressed 
that it was necessary "to remember that the election was 
democratic" and that "this is clearly a majority choice by the 
Italian people. Nobody has the right to dictate to others."

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Reinhard: "Mitterrand: Minimal </F>
Support for Rocard"] 
  [Text] Michel Rocard will probably never be president of 
the Republic. Francois Mitterrand, who twice thwarted his 
ambitions only to appropriate the position himself, will do 
everything he can to prevent [Socialist Party First Secretary] 
Rocard from succeeding him -- and Mr. Mitterrand retains his 
full capacity for making a nuisance of himself. In Tuesday [10 
May] night's televised interview, the president of the Republic 
did not attack his former prime minister. He did worse: He 
ignored him. 
  People had been wondering about Francois Mitterrand's stance 
with regard to the European elections. Members of his entourage 
had dropped hints about his preference for Bernard Tapie, which 
had caused an outcry at "rue de Solferino" [Socialist Party 
headquarters]. This suspicion of betrayal had grown so much 
that the president felt the need to pretend to be scolding his 
staff upon his return from Central Asia. So everybody had to 
hear that the Socialist president supported no other list than 
the Socialist Party's. 
  Unfortunately for Michel Rocard, during Francois 
Mitterrand's 
interview with Paul Amar and Patrick Poivre d'Arvor, the 
president proved unable to put an end to the rumors. On the 
contrary, he gave them a new lease on life. To be sure, he 
indicated he would vote for the only list that is both "European 
and Socialist" and that, as far as he knew, there is only one 
such list. But at no cost would he let himself simply say that 
he supported Rocard's list. As if even saying Michel Rocard's 
name would hurt his mouth. 
  While the president had praise for Philippe Seguin [National 
Assembly speaker], he mustered only minimal support for Michel 
Rocard. To say the least, he did not appear entirely convinced 
of the legitimacy of his successor's position at the helm of the 
Socialist Party. Thus he spoke of the Socialist Party's 
"current managers." One could hardly have been more reserved 
with respect to Michel Rocard himself. 
  The president of the Republic was not only coldly malevolent 
with respect to Mr. Rocard; he also lavished his praise on 
Bernard Tapie, the Socialist's greatest foe in the 12 June 
European election. 
  Mitterrand, who seems to have a special taste for canine 
metaphors, refuses to "howl with the pack." He portrays Mr. 
Tapie as a left-wing man and commends his merits as a sports 
club manager and [former] minister. He even had rather 
encouraging words for him: "He is a man of exceptional energy; 
but above all, I note that he has chosen the side that we may 
term progressive." Rocard would probably have been satisfied 
with lesser compliments. 
  The president went even further on the subject of the 
impending presidential election. He clearly indicated that he 
would not take a stand before the second round of voting. And 
above all he noted that Michel Rocard's candidacy remained to be 
"confirmed" by the Socialists. And to add insult to injury, he 
said he expected the winner to be a right-winger. He could 
hardly have been more malicious toward the Socialist Party's 
"natural" presidential candidate. 
  This behavior does not seem to affect Michel Rocard, 
however, 
who said yesterday on France-Inter radio that he was quite happy 
with this rather ambiguous support. Socialist Party Treasurer 
Pierre Moscovici, in a commentary made on RMC radio on the very 
night of the telecast, was more explicit. He explained that the 
less support Mitterrand gave to Rocard, the more likely the PS 
list would be to succeed. Nevertheless, Socialist officials 
cannot hide from the fact that a failure in the European 
election (less than 20 percent of the votes) would inevitably 
ring the knell of Michel Rocard's presidential ambitions. 
  Francois Mitterrand, who remains one of France's best 
experts 
in electoral matters, knows this. If he decided to obliterate 
this man who has been his foe for the last 30 years, it is 
because he is not one to forgive offences, and also because he 
would like to be able to hand over his position to a left-wing 
man. And he is so certain that this man cannot be Rocard that 
he does everything he can to eliminate him.

  [Text] According to a statement by Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Richard Duque yesterday, France "strongly urges" North 
Korea to accept the new International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) mission which might be sent within the next couple of 
days to inspect Pyongyang's nuclear facilities, where the 
production of an atomic bomb is suspected to be taking place. 
During this new mission, the inspections at the Yongbyon 
reprocessing plant, where IAEA experts were prevented from 
conducting crucial tests in March, should be continued.

  [Text] On Tuesday [10 May], Arthur Paecht, the rapporteur 
of the military programming law, declared that, "according to a 
unanimous recommendation of all experts consulted, the 
resumption of nuclear tests is indispensable." As to the Palen 
test simulation program, it "would not suffice to ensure the 
development of new nuclear charges." The parliamentarian also 
pointed to two other "controversial" issues: "The decision by 
the president of the Republic to keep active the ballistic 
missiles on the Albion plateau" and "the five-year delay in the 
M5 strategic ballistic missile program."

<F P=106> [Interview with Transportation Minister Bernard Bosson by </F>
correspondent Sylvie Johnson; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Bosson] We have confirmed what we have always said; that 
is, that we would open the Orly-London route; that we are 
getting what we wished, in other words that this opening should 
take place without undue haste, enabling the French authorities 
to sort out all the technical, security, environmental, and 
traffic problems at Orly; finally, the British have accepted for 
their part to take into account the difficulties faced by our 
companies in gaining access to London's airports, and in 
particular to Heathrow. We will be able to work on this 
together: these are not simple problems, but from the moment 
that we approach them openly together, I believe that we will be 
able to solve them in the best possible manner. 
  [Johnson] Has a date been set to open Orly Airport to 
British companies? 
  [Bosson] Before 30 June. 
  [Johnson] Have the British committed themselves to giving up 
their attempt to force a landing at Orly this evening or 
tomorrow? 
  [Bosson] Absolutely. There remains the problem that British 
airlines are much more independent of the government than are 
French airline companies, but the British minister is doing 
everything that has to be done in this direction, and the 
problem is completely solved. 
  No plane will land either this evening or tomorrow, and as 
soon as Monday [16 May], we will be working together to examine 
our reciprocal difficulties. Concerning Orly, they are clear, 
and they will be solved quickly, and concerning the London 
airports and Heathrow, the difficulties are known, and they are 
finally being taken into account. I am therefore very satisfied 
at the understanding shown by my British counterpart, and by the 
work we have done, which reflects the our good relations, in 
that it has been open, and has taken due account of our 
reciprocal concerns. 
  [Johnson] Would you describe the agreement as a victory for 
France, for Britain, for Europe? 
  [Bosson] It is a victory for the Franco-British friendship, 
which has enabled us to solve this problem together, with 
reciprocal understanding. It is a perfectly balanced accord.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Jacques Jacquet-Francillon: "The Time for </F>
Decisions"] 
  [Text] It is certainly unusual to find a French foreign 
minister seeking a way out of the quagmire in Bosnia to hold a 
meeting at the highest level in Washington on the very eve of 
the meeting in Geneva of the U.S., Russian, German, British, and 
French foreign ministers. 
  But to what end? And with what cards in his hand? 
  Did Alain Juppe have any chance of persuading his 
interlocutors on the other side of the Atlantic to abandon their 
cautious reserve simply by threatening to withraw our blue 
helmets? 
  Of course, France is entitled to speak loud and clear, 
because it can legitimately invoke the argument that we have 
done more than others: We break the record for the number of 
men in UN uniform in the former Yugoslavia, and also that of the 
number of men killed and wounded. 
  But who asked us to do this? 
  We wanted to set a good example. We were not really followed 
by our allies, aside from the British, to a very relative 
degree. We are now pretending to be determined to "pull out," 
as our military say, if they continue to "abandon us." 
  But are we credible? 
  At a time when [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur is telling 
the National Assembly that "the time for decisions is 
approaching," Alain Juppe merely says in Washington that "the 
withdrawal of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] troops may be 
inevitable," and that, in any case, "it is not possible to spend 
another winter in Bosnia." 
  The time for decisions is therefore not as close as all 
that. 
And this is understandable. Why, after having invested so much 
-- rightly or wrongly -- withdraw at the very time when a 
settlement seems conceivable, however dreadful it might seem? 
  The Serbs have virtually achieved all their objectives. The 
Russians, French, British, and other so-called "Europeans" are 
thoroughly humiliated and are prepared to accept the fait 
accompli, to turn a blind eye to everything they have condemned, 
provided there is a piece of paper, carrying God knows whose 
signatures, which makes it possible to forget the nightmare for 
a moment. 
  The problem is that Bill Clinton and his advisers, who have 
taken care not to venture into the Balkan hornet's nest, do not 
agree with this kind of arrangement. The Americans are 
portraying themselves, at little cost for the time being, as the 
defenders of the Bosnian Muslims. They want the arms embargo to 
be lifted in their favor and they will not consider easing the 
sanctions imposed on Belgrade in any way. 
  The United States did not fight the Gulf War for nothing. It 
is the new defender of the Arab world; and it is in this role 
that the U.S. secretary of state will take his seat in Geneva 
today. 
  Mr. Juppe was right to sound the alarm in Washington. 
America certainly hears it ringing but usually with earplugs in 
its ears.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Claire Trean: "The Temptation of Withdrawal"] </F>
  [Text] Once again there is that nagging feeling that a 
settlement of the Bosnian crisis further off than ever, that 
phoney calm punctuated with violations of past agreements and 
the rekindling of smoldering fires: troops gathering in Brcko, 
tensions in Olovo, etc., i.e., clear signs that Bosnia's warring 
communities are still determined to continue their fighting. 
  Once again, the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] is being 
humiliated both by Serb arrogance and the mistakes of its own 
leaders, that is, for the last few weeks, those of [UN special 
envoy] Akashi. Once again, diplomatic action is dwindling and 
there is a feeling that what had been achieved is being whittled 
away. And once again, also, there is the chronic temptation on 
the part of Western leaders to give it all up: The temptation, 
for those who have troops there, to leave Bosnia. 
  Thus in the past few days [French Foreign Minister] Alain 
Juppe made several cautious mentions of an impending withdrawal 
of [France's] "blue helmets," stating that there was a pressing 
need to "acknowledge" the lack of progress towards a solution. 
To be fair, Mr. Juppe will probably be the last one to call for 
a withdrawal of French soldiers from Bosnia. However, he is not 
alone: Like others, the French Government is divided on the 
issue, and Mr. Juppe has already had to challenge those inclined 
to such an abdication of responsibility, both at the Matignon 
[office of the prime minister] and the Defense Ministry. 
  The more history repeats itself (the deadlock, the 
UNPROFOR's 
fetters, not to mention its current state of discredit), the 
more weariness sets in the minds of those who will give up, both 
in France and in other contributing countries. Of course, short 
of a threat to the UNPROFOR as whole, no one wants to be the 
first to opt for total withdrawal, a decision which public 
opinion would view as forsaking an imperiled population. But 
one can hear once again in Paris talk of a "disproportion" 
between the cost of having soldiers in Bosnia and the precious 
few results achieved there so far; in other words, Paris is 
considering a lopsided and ultimately unjustifiable policy: 
that of partial withdrawal. 
  If Alain Juppe mentions a possible withdrawal of French 
"blue 
helmets," it is not only as a response to such internal 
tensions. His words are also intended for the belligerents as 
well as France's partners in the "management" of the crisis, 
that is, primarily for the United States, a few days before a 
reportedly "important" meeting to be held in Geneva between 
American, European, and Russian ministers. 
  The French foreign minister already used such arguments on 
the eve of previous diplomatic encounters. His message to the 
Americans, which Mr. Juppe will deliver in person on 11 and 12 
May in Washington, boils down to this: Either you play the 
negotiating game straight, or we precipitate the disbanding of 
the UNPROFOR and you will soon be alone in answering Bosnian 
Muslims' calls for help. 
  The latest initiative of Western countries in the Bosnian 
crisis dates back to the aftermath of the Serb's attack on the 
muslim enclave of Gorazde, over a month ago. Under the insult, 
the West, i.e., the United States, Europe, Russia, and the 
United Nations, had finally decided to act by issuing an 
ultimatum to the aggressors and trying to broker new 
negotiations between the belligerents. 
<H5>  Taking Control </H5>
  Unfortunately, both attempts have now proved utterly futile: 
The threat of NATO air strikes does not seem to be a valid 
deterrent any more; once again it highlights the divisions 
between major powers, as shown by Russia's backtracking late 
last week at the Security Council with respect to a resolution 
proposed by the French and the Americans that threatened with 
air strikes against troublemakers in Brcko. 
  As for joint efforts by "the four" to define a foundation 
for 
a settlement jointly with Bosnia's leaders, they achieved 
nothing: The "contact group" (representatives of the major 
powers as well as the United Nations) has been fruitlessly 
shuttling back and forth between Sarajevo and Pale, between 
Serbs and Bosnians, who remain unwilling to negotiate. 
  Hence the idea, which France has long been pushing and which 
the U.S. secretary of state has finally agreed to, of taking 
things one echelon higher, at the ministerial level: In Geneva 
on 13 and 14 May, the United States, Russian, and European 
foreign ministers are expected to try to "take control" and at 
least to define a foundation for a peaceful settlement. 
  This presupposes that they first have to adopt joint 
positions, which is far from being the case right now. The 
notion of imposing a real cease-fire on the belligerents 
stumbles on the problem of the UNPROFOR's limited capacity and 
the restrictive U.S. policy on this point. As for the (French) 
notion of developing guidelines for Bosnia's partition 
(proportion of territory allocated to the various communities, 
special status for enclaves, etc.), it is blocked by American 
reluctance, but above all by realities: Those few square 
kilometers which apparently seem so trivial to French 
bureaucrats are at the very root of past and future fighting in 
Bosnia; they give rise to feelings of unacceptable injustice. 
What France is basically asking the United States to do in the 
name of realpolitik is to convince the Bosnian Muslims to 
capitulate. 
  Last, another French notion -- that the Serbs could be made 
to come round through the promise of a gradual lifting of 
sanctions against Belgrade -- is also foundering not only on 
skepticism on the part of the United States, which until 
recently has still been advocating stricter enforcement of the 
economic embargo, but also on recent developments in Bosnia: 
How could France call for an end to the sanctions while 11 of 
its own nationals are being held hostage by Serb forces?

  [Text] A short time ago UN official Gustave Feissel 
returned from Vienna, where efforts to persuade the Turkish side 
to accept the 21 March document were unsuccessful. In addition 
to Mr. Feissel, the two-day consultations were also attended by 
two Rauf Denktas advisers; Robert Lamb, U.S. special coordinator 
on Cyprus; and Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Tugay Ulucevik. 
  In a statement made after his return, Mr. Feissel noted that 
all of the elements needed to implement the confidence-building 
measures were discussed at the Vienna consultations. He said he 
would be submitting a report to the UN secretary general, and 
added: Of course, we are proceeding with the UN secretary 
general's report to the Security Council, which is expected to 
circulate around the middle of this month as scheduled. 
  Responding to a question on the results of the Vienna 
meetings, Mr. Feissel said he did not want to discuss it because 
the UN secretary general should be briefed first. He added: I 
would like to note that we have covered all aspects because we 
want to know where the Turkish Cypriots stand; this is important 
as the time is nearing for Mr. Butrus-Ghali's report to be 
submitted to the Security Council. Asked if progress was made 
at the talks on the confidence-building measures, Mr. Feissel 
reiterated that he did not want to divulge the details of what 
transpired but he described the meeting as useful. Mr. Feissel 
responded negatively to a question on whether he plans any more 
meetings before the Butrus-Ghali report is submitted, but he 
added that he would be briefing President Glavkos Kliridhis next 
week. 
  At the same time, Robert Lamb left Vienna for London, where 
this evening he will meet with Joe Berg, acting director of the 
South European Department at the British Foreign Office. 
According to our London correspondent, this meeting is a 
briefing on the latest Vienna talks and will also be attended by 
(William Shapcoat), director of the Foreign Office bureau on the 
Cyprus issue.

  [Text] Ankara and Denktas are playing games as they 
attempt to remove all responsibility from the Turkish side, or 
at least to have its responsibility diminished, for the lack of 
progress in the talks due to the well-known stance of the 
Turkish Cypriot leader. This statement was made today by acting 
Government Spokesman Spiros Arotis when he was asked to comment 
on the lengthy explanations Gustave Feissel, UN secretary 
general's alternate special representative, gave in Vienna to 
Rauf Denktas' two advisers. These explanations were made during 
the past two days in the presence of Turkish Deputy Foreign 
Minister Tugay Ulucevik and Robert Lamb, U.S. coordinator on 
Cyprus. Mr. Arotis noted that Ankara and Rauf Denktas have 
played the same game many times in the past. He added: If 
Ankara wanted, it could find ways to persuade Rauf Denktas to 
accept the 21 March document. 
  Responding to another question, the acting government 
spokesman said the Cyprus Government hopes the UN secretary 
general's report will be circulated without any further delay. 
He also emphasized President Glavkos Kliridhis' statement that 
the report should call a spade a spade and noted alternative 
ways for a Cyprus solution. 
  Rauf Denktas has threatened to unite the pseudostate with 
Turkey if Cyprus is accepted as a full member of the European 
Union [EU]. His threat is aimed at putting pressure on the EU, 
specifically on some of its members, so Cyprus' application for 
accession will be denied. This statement was made by Spiros 
Arotis today when asked to comment on the statement made by Rauf 
Denktas in Turkey. Mr. Arotis expressed the conviction that 
Denktas' threats would not find any response whatsoever in the 
EU; he also feels that the international community would not 
allow Rauf Denktas to proceed in this direction. Besides, Mr. 
Arotis added, there is also the reaction of the Turkish 
Cypriots. He pointed out that Turkey itself also seeks 
accession to the EU.

  [Text] Ambassador Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry 
deputy under secretary, has stated that, in the negotiations 
held in Vienna, both the UN representatives and the Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus' [TRNC] representatives exerted 
efforts to eliminate the existing obstacles and reach a solution 
on the Cyprus issue. 
  In a statement he issued in Ankara upon his return from 
Vienna, Ulucevik said that it will be the Turkish Cypriot side 
who will assess whether or not the negotiations were 
satisfactory. Indicating that Robert Lamb, U.S. special 
coordinator on Cyprus, also participated in the negotiations, 
Ulucevik stated that issues such as eliminating the holes in the 
UN secretary general's confidence-building measures package and 
achieving a balance were discussed at the meetings. Noting that 
certain understandings emerged at the negotiations, Ulucevik 
added that only the government of the TRNC and President Rauf 
Denktas can make the real assessment on the issue.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis called on the UN 
Security Council to think seriously whether continuing the talks 
is the way to resolve the Cyprus issue when the Turkish side has 
no political will for this. He also made it clear that the 
Greek Cypriot side will make no suggestions before the National 
Council convenes to discuss the views that will be discussed 
with the Greek Government. 
  In a statement to Greek radio in London before he left for 
Cyprus, Kliridhis added that the UN Security Council must 
consider seriously UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's 
report and that the permanent members must begin work on the 
next step. 
  Kliridhis said it is difficult to define the U.S. stance if 
Washington still believes there is a chance for the 
intercommunal talks to resolve anything, either on the substance 
of the issue or the confidence-building measures. 
  The president said there are no obstacles to convening a 
pannational conference, and that the Greek and Cypriot 
Governments still have to decide on the appropriate time. He 
added: Maybe it would be more suitable to begin with a meeting 
by our National Council with the Greek Government and then 
expand it to a pannational conference. 
  Commenting on a statement by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas about the prospects of Cyprus joining the European 
Union, Kliridhis said Denktas is concerned because he knows that 
when Europe makes it clear that it will accept Cyprus regardless 
of whether there is a solution to the Cyprus issue, Turkey will 
have to decide whether it is willing to solve it or continue to 
be an occupation force. 
  Discussing Turkey's stance, Kliridhis said its views are 
identical to those of Denktas. He added: Turkish Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller wants to create the impression that she is 
trying to keep her promises, but domestic problems and the 
Turkish Cypriot leadership are keeping her from doing so.

  [Text] Lefkosa [Nicosia] (A.A) -- Rahmi Ozyazgan reports: 
Assessing the Vienna talks on the confidence-building measures 
for Cyprus, Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus, said: "The Turkish Cypriot side has rejected 
the changes to the confidence-building measures and will 
continue to do so." 
  In a statement to ANATOLIA, Denktas pointed out that by 
going 
to Vienna and discussing its problem and its views once again, 
the Turkish Cypriot side showed its good will once again, and 
also "said its last word, drew the last line." 
  Denktas pointed out that the masks of the Greek Cypriots are 
falling. He added: "It has become obvious that the Greek 
Cypriots do not intend to reach an agreement with us, but that 
they are ready to hide behind the false title of the legitimate 
Cyprus government and to wage their ugly struggle for another 40 
years in order to get the entire island." 
  Denktas stressed that the Greek Cypriot efforts to join the 
European Union [EU] are of a nature that can totally eliminate 
any developments. Criticizing the stand of the EU, Denktas 
said: "The ball is not in our hands any more. Had the EU made 
a realistic diagnosis of the Cyprus problem, it would not have 
treated the Turkish Cypriots so unjustly for so many years, nor 
would it have given the green light to the Greek Cypriots to 
join the EU on the 30th year of the Cyprus problem. We are 
faced with a strange and unacceptable situation. If we agree, 
our reward will be that the Greek Cypriots will join the EU 
which will mean Cyprus will integrate with Greece in line with 
Greek Cypriot requests. If we refuse, our punishment will be 
the same. 
  "It is our fundamental decision not to join the EU so long 
as 
Turkey is not a member. This is our right, granted to us by the 
1960 agreements. We must defend this right. We will certainly 
not give the Greek Cypriots the opportunity to integrate with 
Greece by seeming to agree to this situation. We prefer to be 
punished and to maintain our rights outside this integration. 
We are being left with no other alternative." 
  Asked to comment on the results of the Vienna talks, Denktas 
said: "The difficulty in Vienna arose because there was 
insistence on the second map we were offered, on the changes 
made in favor of the Greek Cypriots. They insist on the use of 
the Lefkosa Airport by the Greek Cypriot Airline and they insist 
on controlling the road leading to Maras [Varosha] and its 
surroundings. The Turkish Cypriot side has categorically 
rejected this and it will continue to do so."

<F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>
  [Text] The UN Security Council will call on UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to prepare specific proposals to 
break the deadlock on the Cyprus issue and submit them to it for 
examination. Following the failure of the Vienna talks, the 
various countries involved in the Cyprus issue are tending in 
this direction. 
  According to I SIMERINI's information, there will be a 
period 
of background negotiations to prepare new proposals with new 
procedures after Butrus-Ghali submits his report to the Security 
Council. Unofficial efforts to urge the Turkish side to accept 
the confidence-building measures are not being ruled out. 
  Foreign diplomats in Nicosia said the new effort will focus 
on these new ideas and the confidence-building measures, but 
added that they hope that during the procedure the Turkish side 
will accept the confidence-building measures in some form. They 
insist that this is the basis of the talks on a solution. 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas puts his side's demands in 
coded language and he persists in creating a pseudodilemma, with 
the goal of showing that there are only two choices in the 
Cyprus issue: recognition of the pseudostate or union of the 
occupied areas with Turkey. During the Vienna talks, Denktas' 
advisers clarified the positions that were advanced during this 
period. 
  1. Joint management of Famagusta and promotion of separate 
sovereignty; this would be a model for a future settlement. 
  2. Rejection of the proposal to reinstate the law that 
existed until December 1963. They want laws to be approved by 
both communities and the directors of the two areas. (This 
position stems from their view that they do not recognize the 
Republic of Cyprus) 
  3. Because the airport will not go into operation at the 
same 
time as the opening of Famagusta, they want to control the 
passages there in order to be able to block off the city if they 
are unsatisfied with the implementation of the 
confidence-building measures. 
  Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate 
special 
representative in Cyprus, and UN political adviser John Paul 
Kavanagh yesterday worked hard to prepare Butrus-Ghali's report. 
Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on 
the Cyprus issue, has finished briefing the British Foreign 
Office. Talks are expected in the next few days on the various 
scenarios that will be followed. This will be done in a period 
when the United States, just like Britain, is acting especially 
quietly because it does not want to disturb Turkey. This is a 
fact that will be considered in the UN secretary general's 
report and the UN Security Council resolutions.

  [Text] U.S. and British elements, in cooperation with UN 
circles in New York, are making efforts to delay further the UN 
secretary general's report. According to ELEVTHEROTIPIA 
information from reliable sources, the efforts are aimed at 
finding a "middle solution" by promoting a new formula and a new 
timetable for the confidence-building measures. 
  Two foreign diplomats in Cyprus recently expressed the view 
that no effort to promote a solution to the Cyprus issue will 
bear fruit before the occupied pseudostate is recognized in some 
form. Political observers who are aware of these disturbing 
views have personally protested. 
  In any case, it is becoming clearer that mistaken or 
insufficient international understanding of the Cyprus issue in 
recent years has prompted international views and beliefs that 
are very disturbing for our case. For example, the 
parliamentary spokesman of a neighboring country asked his 
foreign minister who their ambassador to the occupied part of 
Cyprus is. 
  According to reliable information, Moscow has two schools of 
thought on how to approach the Cyprus issue. One is almost 
identical to the U.S. policy on the Cyprus issue. The other is 
based on the former Soviet Union's policy on Cyprus--that is, to 
faithfully support Cyprus' independence and territorial 
integrity. 
  According to our source's evaluation, Russian Ambassador to 
Cyprus Boris Zenkov--whose thoughts seem to have affected one of 
the two Russian Foreign Ministry envoys who visited Cyprus 
recently-- belongs to the first school of thought.

<F P=106> [Report by Dinos Menelaou] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Menelaou] The Cyprus issue is at a crossroads 
and President Glavkos Kliridhis, in a statement at Larnaca 
Airport this afternoon, determined the next steps that the Greek 
Cypriot side will take. He was welcomed by Alexis Galanos, 
acting president and House of Representatives president; Foreign 
Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis; and Deputy Minister to the 
President Pandlis Kouros. [passage omitted] 
  The president rejected the view that the British and the 
Americans are mocking the Cypriot people with their continuous 
interventions to delay the UN Secretary General's report from 
being submitted and explained the reason why. 
  [Kliridhis] It is a fact that both the United States and 
Britain believed that there was still a possibility that Mr. 
Rauf Denktas would accept the Secretary General's document on 
the implementation of the confidence-building measures. Their 
policy was that we should not hurry, since there were some 
indications -- not from Mr. Denktas, but from Mrs. Tansu Ciller 
-- that there was still room to negotiate. Therefore, let us 
not talk about mockery; this was the situation as they saw it. 
The question was clarified during the Vienna meeting. 
  [Menelaou] President Kliridhis also referred to the role 
that Russia can play in the Cyprus issue. 
  [Kliridhis] It can play a serious role. It appears that 
there are new developments in Russian foreign policy. While for 
some time Russia was prepared merely to follow the policy of 
others, it has returned to the forefront and wants to show that 
it has its own policy. This is a new development that we are 
very interested in seeing.

  [Excerpt] President Rauf Denktas has said that the Cyprus 
problem is speedily advancing toward a decision. Pointing out 
that the Greek Cypriots are taking unilateral steps to join the 
European Union [EU], Denktas added: This course of events will 
quickly take us somewhere. We should be morally and financially 
ready for this. 
  Addressing the Turkish Peace Operation War Veterans 
Association's 10th General Council meeting in Lefkosa [Nicosia] 
today, Denktas said that more solidarity and unity are needed at 
the current stage of the Cyprus problem. Denktas said the Greek 
Cypriots have, with an unacceptable determination and 
insistence, begun to take steps toward joining the EU while 
Greece is trying to increase its territorial waters to 12 
nautical miles. He added that the people's complaints regarding 
land registry problems should be solved in a bid to put a stop 
to this development. Denktas called on the government to open a 
new page and give land ownership to the people, adding that he 
has been fighting for this all along. Pointing out that he is 
speaking on behalf of the people and that his demands are on the 
half of the people, Denktas added: If this is not done, then I 
will choose to be with the people. He noted that one cannot 
achieve anything by saying that the Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus will exist, adding that as long as the people do not say 
this is my country, land, and house, then nothing much can be 
achieved by empty words. He asked Prime Minister Hakki Atun to 
grant the people the ownership of their land and real estate. 
  Also addressing the meeting, Atun said he shares Denktas' 
views and sentiments, adding that it is his duty to solve the 
problems of war veterans. He noted that priority will be given 
to the land registry problem, stressing that it will be solved 
soon. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government intends 
to allow refugees from the civil war in Rwanda to enter Germany 
on an individual basis. This assurance was given by the Foreign 
Ministry in Bonn today after the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU newspaper 
had attacked the entry ban that has been applied so far. This 
also affects the family of the former Rwandan ambassador to Bonn. 
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the new ruling was 
currently being agreed with the national and regional Interior 
Ministries. Entry will always require approval from the 
competent Interior Ministry and the German aliens' authority. 
It will have to be examined whether the visa payment could be 
dropped for the Rwandan refugees. "There is room for maneuver 
there," the spokesman stressed. 
  The Foreign Ministry, headed by Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel, had initially said it was not responsible for the 
question of the entry ban on the civil war refugees. It said 
that the regional interior ministers alone were responsible for 
deciding on entry and residence matters. The national Interior 
Ministry rejected this sweeping statement. An Interior Ministry 
spokesman said the Foreign Ministry was able to issue visas for 
each individual case. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Duesseldorf (DDP/ADN) -- European unification is a 
question of war and peace in the 21st century, according to 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In view of the dramatic changes in 
Germany, Europe, and the world in the past few years, the 
priority now must be to make the political and economic 
unification of Europe irreversible, Kohl said today at the 45th 
master craftsmen's meeting of Duesseldorf Chamber of Trades and 
Crafts. 
  Kohl reaffirmed his support for a federal Europe and firmly 
rejected a central European bureaucracy. It is now primarily a 
question of bringing life to the Maastricht Treaty. A common 
asylum policy and the fight against cross-border crime are 
important issues. 
  Europe is also vital for the German economy, the chancellor 
said. Over 3.5 million jobs in Europe -- about every 10th job -- 
now depend on exports to the other countries of the European 
Union. 
  Kohl pointed out that society needs a lively small business 
sector which takes risks and is a dynamic force. He called upon 
the trades and crafts sector to continue this year to do all it 
can to ensure an adequate supply of training places. The state 
will provide the necessary supplementary funds -- despite the 
budget constraints -- only if they are proved to be insufficient.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
announced a deregulation offensive in the European Union [EU] 
under the German presidency in the second half of 1994. 
Decisions should be made in Brussels only if they have to be 
made there, Kohl today told a conference of the Central 
Federation of German Commercial Travelers' and Brokers' 
Associations in Bonn. 
  At the same time, the chancellor again supported European 
unity. It is essential not only for the German economy. Europe 
is also insurance against a relapse into chauvinism, ethnic 
conflicts, and religious fanaticism, which are present not just 
in the Balkans.

<F P=106> [Interview with Claudia Roth, Alliance/Greens top candidate </F>
for the European Parliament elections, by Karl-Otto Sattler; 
place and date not given: "Opponents Are the Right-Wing 
Extremists"] 
  [Text] Claudia Roth considers herself to be a 
"passionate European." As an opponent of Maastricht, however, 
the Alliance 90/Greens top candidate for the European Parliament 
[EP] elections on 12 June sees this treaty as a symbol of an 
undemocratic European Union [EU] that helps rather than hinders 
right-wing nationalists. Eight German Greens went to Strasbourg 
in 1989 as members of the European Parliament and two have since 
joined other parliamentary groups. Karl-Otto Sattler spoke with 
39-year-old Claudia Roth. 
  [Sattler] You and other Green members of the European 
Parliament have filed an appeal in Karlsruhe for a 
constitutional review of the Maastricht Treaty--like the 
nationalist and anti-European Manfred Brunner. Is it a 
comfortable feeling to be in such company? 
  [Roth] I was never in league with Mr. Brunner. We filed a 
constitutional appeal against Maastricht because we are for 
Europe; Brunner did so because he is against Europe and because 
he wants the national option. I am passionately for Europe but I 
am equally convinced that this Europe cannot be achieved with a 
European Union that is thoroughly undemocratic. For me, 
Maastricht is a symbol of that kind of undemocratic structure. I 
fear that this helps rather than hinders right-wing nationalists. 
  [Sattler] It is mostly criticism of the EU--of the EU's 
environmental, asylum, and transportation policies--that is 
forthcoming from the Greens. Do you, in fact, have a positive, 
pro-European perspective? 
  [Roth] In a time of renationalization of politics, it is our 
job to present a European option in contrast to these 
tendencies. It has to be a democratic option, however. At issue, 
for example, is a true separation of powers--a fundamental 
element of democracy that is not built into the EU. Moreover, 
our understanding of Europe extends beyond the EU; our concern 
is to overcome the division of Europe as a whole--a task that is 
urgent following the collapse of the former East Bloc. 
  [Sattler] What kind of politics have the Greens engaged in 
thus far in Strasbourg: Principled opposition or 
realpolitik? 
  [Roth] Both, and that is not at all a contradiction. In many 
areas we have introduced a fundamentally different approach and 
formulated alternatives based on different principles. In our 
case, for example, the debate about an integrated ecology policy 
is very much further advanced than it is in the Bundestag. We 
have also engaged in realpolitik by introducing 
amendments on the most diverse subjects. 
  [Sattler] Were there specific instances of success? 
  [Roth] We have had some successes. Caution is advised, to be 
sure, so that one does not get caught up too much in this farce. 
If someone thinks that he can be a real parliamentary 
representative here, he is, in my view, falling for a stage 
production. A European Union theater piece is being quickly 
staged and that is dangerous. For me, a success is when, for 
example, after preliminary work with the other parliamentary 
groups, we pass a very good resolution in a current affairs 
debate on the situation in Turkey that then mobilizes the public 
there and helps individual people. Of course, as a member of the 
European Parliament I cannot draft any real laws, but you have 
to be aware of that in advance. I also function a little bit as 
a kind of extraparliamentary opposition in a parliament that is 
not very democratic. 
  [Sattler] What are the Greens' main points of emphasis in 
the 
election campaign? Who is your opponent? 
  [Roth] Our opponents in the election campaign are all those 
who fool around with rightist, right-wing extremist, and racist 
ideologies. We fight for a Europe in which all citizens have the 
same rights. We oppose a Europe with ethnic hierarchies. We 
commit ourselves to the democratization of the EU. And we want 
to overcome the division of Europe as a whole: East Europe must 
be included. Then there is an issue that no longer seems to be 
very attractive but that is very important for us--the 
ecological restructuring of industrial society--and starting at 
the European level. 
  [Sattler] Elections for the European Parliament function for 
the most part as elections in which voters send a message 
regarding domestic political issues--something which the Greens 
can also profit from. Will people vote on 12 June for your party 
for reasons of European policy at all? 
  [Roth] I hope very much so. But you are right, that is a 
real 
sore spot. As a matter of fact, it is hardly about Europe at 
all. Basically, it is a kind of preliminary Bundestag election. 
In the campaign, I am striving to have our party--our 
clients--deal with Europe. Even among Greens people often still 
persist in thinking along national lines. Many citizens have no 
idea of the far-reaching influence of European policy on every 
individual. That is why we say: Concern yourselves with Europe, 
take Europe seriously!

  [Text] Siegburg/Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German business 
representatives in Moscow seem to be increasingly at risk from 
the Russian mafia. This was the gist of an alarming telegram 
sent by the German Embassy in Moscow to the German Foreign 
Ministry headquarters, according to the `Bonn-Info' information 
service. Today a Foreign Ministry spokesman was unwilling either 
to deny or confirm the telegram for the moment because of the 
diplomatic nature of the message. 
  In the embassy's view, there is a "strong probability" of 
German associations and firms "coming into contact with 
organized crime sooner or later," particularly in Moscow and St. 
Petersburg. That only left a "choice between paying or 
leaving." The mafia was trying to plant "bookkeepers" to 
monitor company income to secure their "tax share" in the form 
of protection money. 
  Firms with retail outlets or storage buildings in particular 
were therefore coming to arrangements with blackmailers to 
prevent the risk of their buildings being "torched." The 
blackmailers were also frequently threatening the lives of the 
businessmen and their families. In its telegram, the embassy 
raises the question of whether the German Government should 
advise against business activity in Russia in the event of 
growing risks. Protection from the Russian authorities was 
"insufficiently guaranteed".

  [Text] Bonn, 12 May -- Cooperation between German and 
Russian savings banks, which has existed since the end of 1991, 
is to be further developed and intensified. This has been 
agreed by Horst Koehler, president of the German Giro 
Association (DSGV), and Oleg Yashin, president of Rossberbank, 
at a meeting in Bonn. As the DSFV announced, the Russian 
savings bank, which has 42,000 offices, 200,000 employees, and a 
balance sheet sum of about 2 billion German marks, is among the 
five largest Russian banks and is the only Russian bank that has 
a nationwide network of offices. 
  According to the DSGV, other fields of cooperation are a 
small-loan program for the newly developing medium-sized 
industry in Nishniy-Novgorod, participation in financing housing 
construction and in leasing business, advice for the 
establishment of a savings bank association, as well as joint 
ventures with the Central German Handicrafts Association (ZDH), 
whose Secretary General Hanns-Eberhard Schleyer also attended 
the meeting in Bonn. Already, the German savings banks and land 
banks are participating in the establishment of a decentralized, 
market economy banking sector in Russia via the Savings Banks 
Foundation for International Cooperation.

<F P=106> ["egl"-signed report: "Kopper Praises General Conditions </F>
for Companies and Financial Institutions"] 
  [Text] Prague -- With the establishment of a branch in 
Prague, the Deutsche Bank wants to step up its activities in the 
Czech Republic, explained Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank 
spokesman, at the opening ceremony. Speaking at the opening, 
Vaclav Klaus, the head of the Czech Government, welcomed the 
increased presence of foreign banks in his country. 
  The Prague branch, which is headed by Gerd-Dieter Griese and 
Jaroslav Kudena, is the first Deutsche Bank branch in one of the 
neighboring states in the east. "We not only want to give Czech 
companies access to the international capital market, but also 
assist them with local capital market transactions," said Kopper. 
  The opening of the branch in Prague comes a few months after 
the opening of the Prague Stock Exchange. In view of the bank's 
long-term business strategy, the fact that these events are so 
close in time can only be a coincidence, but the Deutsche Bank's 
heightened presence comes "at the right time in light of the 
development of the capital market also." 
  Over the past few years, foreign investors have made direct 
investments totaling 5 billion German marks in the Czech 
Republic, stressed Vaclav Klaus. Germany is among the largest 
investors. "This figure shows how companies and investors from 
all over the world view this country's prospects." The economic 
transformation process in the Czech Republic has followed a 
particularly straight course so far. It has only taken four 
years for a private sector to emerge which already accounts for 
a large part of GDP. Numerous plants have been privatized in 
the meantime, but what is even more impressive for foreign 
observers is the great number of new business that have been 
formed. 
  Deutsche Bank, which has had a representation in Prague 
since 
1990, wants to provide better support in the Czech Republic for 
investors from Germany and other countries. Finally, there is a 
growing demand for banking services from Czech companies, 
especially with respect to leading companies into the European 
single market. 
  Deutsche Bank will make a resolute effort to ensure that 
"the 
EU's [European Union] markets will be opened up even more." If 
the states of Central Europe are rapidly drawn into the 
international division of labor, this will serve to bolster 
political stability on the continent. "We need an EU that is 
open to all Europeans."

<F P=106> [Report by Martin S. Lambeck: "Turn of Tides for Kohl in </F>
Opinion Polls"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Almost all recent opinion polls indicate 
that the mood in the population is changing in favor of the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In various inquiries, Kohl is also 
catching up in the direct comparison with his contender, Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping. 
  The recent figures received by the Chancellor's Office in 
Bonn also reveal that the situation has improved in the new 
laender. This includes a survey carried out by the Allensbach 
Opinion Research Institute, according to which as many as 52 
percent of those asked in all of Germany believe that there will 
soon be "flourishing landscapes" in eastern Germany. 
  The question that was put to 1,036 citizens was: "Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1990 said that there would soon be 
flourishing landscapes in the eastern laender. He was laughed 
at for this statement and exposed to a lot of criticism. What 
do you think, will there be flourishing landscapes in the 
eastern laender before long or can this not be expected?" Only 
34 percent of those asked stated that one could not expect it, 
with 14 percent saying neither yes nor no. 
  In a survey carried out by the Forsa-Institute, for the 
first 
time 33 percent preferred Kohl to Scharping, who received only 
29 percent. In an Emnid survey carried out last week among 
1,500 citizens, the CDU/CSU for the first time stands at 40 
percent again and the SPD only at 39 percent. In the Emnid 
survey, 48 percent preferred Scharping to Kohl in the direct 
comparison. Compared to the previous Emnid survey, the SPD 
challenger dropped 6 percent from 54 percent, while Kohl scored 
44 percent this time. 
  The most recent Infas survey sees support for the CDU/CSU at 
38 percent and the SPD at 39 percent. One pollster explained: 
"In the Lower Saxony election of March, the SPD had gone across 
the top in the polls by reaching 40 percent. Ever since, it has 
remained beneath the 40-percent level in all Infas surveys. The 
CDU/CSU, however, has increased its popularity virtually one 
percentage point each month since mid-February (35.5 percent)."

<F P=106> [Interview with Social Democratic Party of Germany leader </F>
Rudolf Scharping by Ulrich Rosenbaum; place and date not given: 
"Scharping Sees an Opportunity for the SPD"] 
  [Text] [Rosenbaum] Eleven months ago, the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany] rank and file elected you SPD 
leader. What has changed for you since then? 
  [Scharping] Personally? I work harder and have less free 
time. 
  [Rosenbaum] And what has changed for the SPD? 
  [Scharping] The SPD has bcome more cohesive and much more 
determined regarding the elections than one expected 12 months 
ago. 
  [Rosenbaum] The SPD has also become more uniform, At least 
that is what the people of the Left are saying. 
  [Scharping] The SPD was and remains a reform-minded party 
that enjoys debate. In an open society, one can only 
communicate by presenting clear objectives and arguments, not by 
issuing orders. 
  [Rosenbaum] Have you already taken the next conflict into 
consideration? 
  [Scharping] The principles of our policy are clear -- we 
want a change in politics so that life is more free and safe. 
For example, we want to see the combating of unemployment and 
more social justice. We have a government program, which will 
be adopted at the party congress on 22 June. Perhaps a few 
minor points in this program will be adjusted at the same time. 
  [Rosenbaum] Such as financial and social policy? The Left 
is not very happy. 
  [Scharping] We are determined not to raise taxation above 
the levels planned for 1995. We want a restructuring so that an 
economic improvement occurs for everyone. We want more than 
just a rise in foreign demand. For the time being, we in 
Germany are reaping the fruits of better economic policies in 
foreign countries while at the same time experiencing a weak 
rate of economic development and a growth in unemployment. This 
year, unemployment will have risen by 500,000. 
  [Rosenbaum] Even so, the ruling coalition could take 
advantage of the first signs of the economic improvement. Are 
you not afraid of that? 
  [Scharping] No. This is not an economic improvement for 
everyone. The SPD wants an economic improve for everyone. The 
SPD's situation tends to improve in line with economic 
improvement. 
  [Rosenbaum] The Forsa research institute said this week that 
this is the first time in any election year that Kohl is ahead 
of Scharping. 
  [Scharpoing] Forsa might say that, but the population thinks 
differently. That is suggested by many other surveys. The 
population is cleverer and more careful in its assessments than 
many propaganda-mongers make out. 
  [Rosenbaum] The ruling chancellor has a major advantage. He 
has been in office for a long time. He can lay down topics and 
create results. 
  [Scharping] Well, no one is going to forget the results of 
12 years of Kohl -- high unemployment, high debts, major 
injustice, and no future prospects. What else I do not like 
about the government is its partially dishonorable and 
unconstitutional use of government resources for the purpose of 
propaganda. That is a violation of the judgments of the 
Constitutional Court. 
  [Rosenbaum] Do you want to copy Clinton, together with his 
slogan: It's time for a change? 
  [Scharping] Not directly. However, it is certainly no 
disadvantage that Clinton and I belong to the same generation. 
  [Rosenbaum] The presidential elections are the next 
appointment in election year, even if the people have no voice. 
Have you taken steps to prevent the SPD and its supporters from 
falling into a depression if they fail to win a majority for 
Johannes Rau. 
  [Scharping] Until I am proved wrong, I assume that the 
members of the Federal Assembly have enough sovereignty to 
dispense with parochial party tactics. In any case, as far as 
the Bundestag deputies are concerned, the election will take 
place on the basis of the majority relations of 1990, and not, 
unfortunately, on the basis of the fact that the majority of the 
German population wants Rau to become president. 
  [Rosenbaum] The FDP [Free Democratic Party] is displaying 
greater cohesiveness than it did a few weeks ago. Do you still 
have a chance of entering into a red-green coalition? 
  [Scharping] No. Life experience shows that on election day, 
16 October, the SPD will have more partners than it needs. I am 
also sure that at its party congress, the FDP will speak out in 
favor of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], but with the 
proviso that the electorate must itself create the basis of this 
support. In clear German, this means: The FDP will watch the 
results of the elections on the evening of 16 October, and then 
reconsider its offer. 
  [Rosenbaum] One again hears disappointing tones from the 
Greens. Ludger Volmer says you are authoritarian and do not 
want to cooperate with the Greens. 
  [Scharping] Obviously, the Greens are not used to being 
criticized for their illusionary and unrealistic demands, which 
include calls for the abolition of the Bundeswehr, the 
dissolution of NATO, and a gasoline price of 5 German marks [DM] 
per liter. The Greens will find no partners if they suggest such 
things. I also find it unfair that the Greens adopted at their 
party congress a resolution in favor of the closure of all 
nuclear power stations within the space of two years, a 
resolution, which, by the way, goes against the express wishes 
of Joschka Fischer. It would take much longer to close the 
nuclear power stations and will cost about DM200 billion. The 
Greens make no mention of that. 
  [Rosenbaum] The European elections are ahead of us. 
Lafontaine has said we have paid too much into the EU's coffers. 
What do you say to that? 
  [Scharping] He meant we have paid more than necessary. Here 
we are dealing with the extreme carelessness of Messrs Waigel 
and Kohl who, in 1993, in full knowledge of the fact that 
Germany is no longer in second place on the European prosperity 
table, but in seventh place, decided on a disproportionately 
high level of payments to the EU. In addition, we are paying 
over DM1 billion per year for Great Britain's rebate. This must 
be changed. To compensate, Lafontaine has called for higher 
influxes of EU funds to Germany. 
  [Rosenbaum] The old parties seem rather helpless in the face 
of the Democratic Socialist Party's [PDS] success in eastern 
Germany. Should the SPD not realize that as a left-wing 
people's party, it obviously cannot prevent this development? 
  [Scharping] We are going to be by far the strongest party in 
eastern Germany, but I must admit that the government's policies 
have directly contributed to the PDS's increased strength. But 
whoever votes for the PDS out of anger for Kohl and his empty 
promises is indirectly strengthening the CDU, for every vote for 
the PDS is a vote against the formation of a new government. 
Therefore we are firmly against the PDS as the direct descendant 
of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. But we are not against 
the PDS' voters. We want to have them for ourselves. 
  [Rosenbaum] Is there a clear no at all levels to cooperation 
with the PDS? 
  [Scharping] Yes. The PDS is a clear political opponent not 
only in daily matters, but also in political convictions.

<F P=106> [Werner Adam editorial: "Between Pretension and Reality"] </F>
  [Text] For the first time in a long period, his country is 
acting like a superpower in a world that no longer threatens 
anyone, the Russian president hinted in Bonn. This is a 
historically memorable sentence of topical significance. At a 
time when nationalist and neoimperial voices are rising in 
Russia, it proves Yeltsin to be a courageous man who frankly 
admitted that Moscow posed a danger for far too long. 
  In spite of such reasonable behavior, however, the leader of 
the Kremlin and his military officials showed little 
understanding for the mistrust that still prevails in the close 
and more distant neighborhood. The Russian leadership reacts 
more sensitively than ever before to persisting doubts regarding 
its assurances that it is fully committed to fruitful 
international cooperation. 
  When the Soviet Union still existed, one of its most 
powerful 
leaders in foreign policy made it clear that the West's 
difficulties in understanding Russia stem from the fact that "we 
are a nuclear superpower with an inferiority complex." No 
matter how adequate such descriptions may be, such explanations 
can easily lead from realpolitik to a wrong psychological path 
and cause even more misunderstandings. Moscow contributes to 
this in a way that cannot be fully explained with the 
after-effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Whereas the 
relief over the disappearance of imperial burdens and the 
prospects for a democratic Russia based on the rule of law 
seemed to outweigh the pain over the fall of the Bolshevik 
empire that was reminiscent of the czarist realm, Moscow seems 
to fluctuate between the greater Russian desire to regain 
international respect as a reawakened superpower as it were and 
the need to seek closer relations with the West dictated by its 
economic decline. 
  Thus, the uncertainty that prevails in the world regarding 
Russia's future course, caused by Russia's inferiority complex 
and its megalomania, makes Western efforts -- which were once 
more confirmed by Germany -- to integrate Russia in the European 
network of relations understandable. It is generally expected 
that this will curb the country's unpredictability, while at the 
same time strengthening its self-confidence. However, such 
endeavors are limited because, despite the collapse of the 
Soviet Union, Russia has continued to be an enormous Eurasian 
colossus that can only be incorporated into European structures 
while risking an upsetting of the balance. Thus, Russia's 
demand for special treatment seems plausible at first sight. 
However, if one takes a closer look and analyzes Moscow's 
ideas, as expounded by Yeltsin and his Defense Minister Grachev 
in Bonn, considerable doubts arise. 
  Russia is not only trying to ensure that its possible 
participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace is rewarded with 
the promise for a special role that would be justified to a 
certain extent in view of the country's status as a nuclear and 
military power and its ability to defend itself if need be. 
However, apart from the fears that such preferential treatment 
would prompt, particularly among the former satellites of the 
Soviet Union in Central and East Europe, Moscow wants much more. 
It wants to be consulted prior to all major NATO decisions, 
and, via a right of veto resulting therefrom, it strives for 
something like the subordination of the Atlantic alliance under 
the roof of the CSCE, which would weaken NATO at the expense of 
an -- inefficient -- collective security system. Since the 
Russian leadership cannot expect the West to comply with its 
wishes, the suspicion is not unfounded that, with a deliberate 
exaggeration, it wants to ensure that other demands are met more 
easily. 
  These demands include Russia's desire to be recognized by 
NATO, the CSCE, and the United Nations as a power within the 
boundaries of the former Soviet Union that influences the world 
order. In fact, the West is inclined to grant this role to the 
Russian armed forces in such unstable regions as the Caucasus 
and Central Asia because of its own lack of readiness to become 
active there. However, one should not overlook that Russia 
contributed essentially to the creation of conflict zones, 
including that in Georgia, in Nagorno Karabakh, over which 
Armenia and Azerbajan are fighting, and in Tajikistan. 
Moreover, Moscow's efforts to establish closer political and 
military ties with the successor states to the Soviet Union, 
which are now loosely united in the CIS, and to present the 
whole territory again as a geopolitical unit dominated by the 
key country of the former empire are also questionable. 
  It does not really suit the West to see Russia as a future 
partner of whom nobody need be afraid any more. In fact, the 
West should not do anything to strengthen Russia's deep-seated 
feeling of offended national pride and of loneliness as a state, 
which really exists. However, Russia can only free itself from 
this feeling -- by depriving the neighboring countries of the 
basis of their mistrust and by conceding priority to inner 
reforms and not to external greed.

<F P=106> [Josef Joffe editorial: "The Chancellor's Informal Address </F>
for `Boris'"] 
  [Text] Which memories can be merged? The blending in the 
melting pot of goodwill is not all that simple, as both Helmut 
Kohl and Boris Yeltsin have had to find out. The chancellor was 
not invited to Normandy by the three Western powers to celebrate 
the 50th anniversary of the invasion. And the Russian president 
is not allowed to celebrate the withdrawal of his troops in a 
joint ceremony with the three protecting powers in Berlin. 
  Kohl has made a wise decision regarding the Berlin question 
-- same day, same place: yes; together: no. And that is right, 
since the Russians must not be lumped together with the 
Americans, the British, and the French. Admittedly, they all 
liberated Germany from the Nazis -- and for the Russians this 
involved enormous sacrifices -- but afterwards the Western 
powers and the Soviets played such different roles that honoring 
them in a joint ceremony would be "revaluing all values." 
  The Red Army brought freedom to the Germans, the Europeans 
-- 
and shortly afterwards it took it away again from those in the 
East: There, brown [Nazi] totalitarianism was replaced by the 
red variety. The Western powers protected freedom -- in West 
Germany and West Berlin at least. What would have become of 
West Berlin if the West had not counteracted the blockade (which 
ended almost exactly 45 years ago) so courageously? If the 
western part of the city had been incorporated into the Soviet 
zone, European history would have taken a different course, 
although not a better one. 
  Noting this difference instead of covering it up has nothing 
to do with discrimination or downgrading, but with the 
self-confidence of a state that is committed to freedom. And 
with gratitude: Yeltsin's predecessors were the occupiers, the 
Western powers were the defenders, and they will remain our 
allies. To honor these two in a joint ceremony would be just as 
doubtful historically and morally as would attempts at 
fraternizing in Normandy, where one side remembers its victory 
and the other its defeat -- unless a German chancellor can make 
himself celebrate the event as the beginning of liberation, 
without any ifs or buts. 
  Not all memories blend well, and anyone covering up the past 
will be unable to cope with the future. And the future of 
Germans and Russians must be dealt with today -- before the last 
occupier has left the country. The German-Russian past was not 
a good one: When they were not getting at each other's throats 
-- see World Wars I and II -- they very often made deals with 
one another at the expense of their neighbors -- see the various 
divisions of Poland, Bismarck's help against the Polish uprising 
of 1863/64, [the Treaty of] Rapallo, and the 1939 Hitler-Stalin 
Pact, which made it easy for Hitler to start World War II. 
  Relations were hardly ever stable, but what is needed now 
are 
relations characterized by responsibility. Strategically 
speaking, things are easier for the Germans now than they have 
been in 50 years: They are "surrounded" by friends only, 
separated from the Russian military force that no longer camps 
in the heart of Europe, but 1,500 kilometers to the east. And 
the GDR pressure spot, which warned Bonn not to misbehave for 
decades and strained its Western connection, has also 
disappeared. 
  Today, Germany is freer vis-a-vis Moscow than ever, but it 
is 
not free from responsibility. Russia is as much a burden on 
Europe as ever, but the problem is no longer expansion, but 
explosion. Yeltsin's demand to be addressed formally by the rest 
of the world shows an almost paranoid insecurity. Of course, 
politics cannot be reduced to psychiatry, but this is where 
Germany's entirely new difficulties start. 
  To treat a partner as a patient will hardly promote his self 
respect; also, you cannot psychoanalyze a nation. What is 
getting Russia down -- such as the catastrophic 25 percent fall 
in production -- has reasons that are entirely homemade and 
which cannot be cured by injecting further billions. On the 
other hand, it is not in the West's interest, not to speak of 
Germany's, to see the Russian empire go the way of the Hapsburg 
and the Ottoman Empires, whose disintegration paved the way for 
World War I. 
  What can be done? Symbolic gestures always help when 
self-confidence is down. These include the grand style in which 
Bonn has treated "Boris," also the chancellor's friendly, 
informal way of addressing Yeltsin, the wise compromise on the 
troops' farewell, the installing of a "hot line" between the two 
countries, which resumes the famous metaphor coined by Bismarck 
who said that the "line to St. Petersburg" must never break off. 
If this helps Yeltsin stand up to the Rutskoys and 
Zhirinovskiys at home, all the better. 
  But a responsible German policy must go beyond niceties. "On 
the other hand," the chancellor said quite rightly, "we and our 
Western partners are expecting Russia to cooperate 
constructively in overcoming European and international crises." 
This is a warning and a compliment at the same time. The 
warning is that Russia should not use its weakness as a stick, 
as it used to do with its strength. And the compliment is that 
the West wants to have, and honors, Moscow as a partner.

<F P=106> [Winfried Muenster commentary: "To Unify Europe Means To </F>
Think of Strasbourg"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 12 May -- Three years ago, at the time of 
the negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty, Helmut Kohl pretended 
to be decidedly heretical. Unasked, he stated that in 1994 he 
would not recommend to the citizens to elect a European 
Parliament to which basic rights are still denied. At that time, 
the chancellor wanted to exert pressure to ensure that the 
Maastricht conference paid the same attention to the development 
of the former European Community into a democratically 
legitimated political union as part of the project of monetary 
union. 
  The Strasbourg chamber still does not have the most 
important 
of all parliamentary rights, that is, the power to pass laws. 
But now, four weeks before the election, Kohl does not call for 
an election boycott because this would not serve the cause, the 
European unification process. A poor turnout at the election 
does not exactly improve the parliament's chances of ever 
getting more power. On the other hand, it is hard to imagine 
that the Community might once again get new responsibilities 
that are not accompanied by credible parliamentary control. A 
growing number of member states would not take part in that. 
Thus, those who want to continue to put the Strasbourg chamber 
forever on the backburner, are curbing, in fact, European 
integration. The conclusion for the deputies is that they are 
more or less obliged to struggle for their own rights if they 
want to advance the development of the European Union. And it 
is likely that they do not want to refrain once again from using 
their means of power, such as the refusal to ratify the entry of 
new laender. If Switzerland were to submit an application for 
membership in a few years, a frustrated parliament would 
probably be obstinate. 
  Thus, in the future the unification of Europe will mean 
thinking of the Strasbourg parliament. The question is only 
whether Maastricht II, the second conference for the examination 
of the treaty scheduled for 1996, will seriously consider 
further integration at that time. Apart from the British, all 
who reflected on the Community at the time of Maastricht still 
had the European federal state in mind, as if this were 
self-evident. However, hardly anybody talks of this anymore. 
After the nations lacked the necessary enthusiasm for the 
treaty, more and more governments are opposing integration. At 
the table of the Council of Ministers in Brussels, political 
blackmail triumphs more and more frequently over reasonable 
compromises -- would it not be too much of a good thing to 
really give the "obscure" Strasbourg chamber legislative power? 
For example, the partner state, Germany, which is otherwise so 
well disposed toward integration, reacted to the Community's 
increase in power, as a result of Maastricht, with more control 
powers for the national parliament -- instead of strengthening 
the rights of the European Parliament. 
  Thus, the unification process has perhaps already been 
stopped, so that those who want to advance it -- undoubtedly, 
the chancellor can be considered one of them -- have to think of 
something. Consistently thought out to the end, the completion 
of the Strasbourg parliament as the second chamber, in addition 
to the Council of Ministers, cannot be avoided because only in 
this way can the powers of the European institutions be brought 
to a stable balance. It is wrong to deny the parliament its 
full rights; rather, it would be correct to precisely define the 
field for which they are valid -- for example, for all 
resolutions that are adopted with a qualified majority in the 
Brussels Council of Ministers. Thus, the people in Strasbourg 
would not get the right to levy taxes, but the power to use the 
revenue from a tax reserved to the Community. These are not 
pipe dreams, but integration policy objectives that seem to be 
attainable by 1996, though perhaps not with all partner states. 
What matters is that France and Germany want it. Helmut Kohl 
knows that only then will his Europe rest on a solid foundation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report including interview with People's Party </F>
Chairman Jose Maria Aznar; place and date of interview not 
given: "Jose Maria Aznar: Deputy Prime Minister Serra Is 
Jointly Responsible for Roldan's Appointment"] 
  [Text] People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar emphasized 
yesterday that the deterioration in the country's grave 
situation has increased and that public tension has soared over 
the past few days -- especially since the holding of the state 
of the nation debate. Aznar stated that, as long as Felipe 
Gonzalez remains in charge of the government, "instability in 
Spain is guaranteed, with all the negative consequences that 
that entails." The opposition leader reiterated that "Gonzalez' 
only decent solution is for him to relinquish his post." In 
Aznar's opinion, "it is impossible" to believe that Gonzalez, 
who is responsible for the current atmosphere of political 
crisis, can champion the struggle against corruption. 
  People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar began his statement 
as follows: "You all recall the state of the nation debate that 
we held in the Congress of Deputies 19 April. Some 15 days have 
elapsed since the debate, during which the deterioration of the 
situation has increased and worsened, and the public's tension 
and anxiety have grown. And the social alarm in the country at 
the political situation existing in the country right now has 
also increased. And you all also recall that in that debate I 
offered Mr. Gonzalez a decent solution, which was that he tender 
his resignation as head of government and that another member of 
his party take over the office of prime minister and try to 
tackle the country's situation. You also all know that that 
proposal was rejected, and what has happened during this time 
and the consequences of that rejection should be recalled today 
-- 15 days later." 
  "Well, during those 15 days," Aznar continued, "Roldan, a 
former Civil Guard director general, has fled, has appeared 
before the news media, and has threatened the government. 
Interior Minister Asuncion has had to tender his resignation as 
a result of Mr. Roldan's escape, after stating that he was under 
surveillance. Agriculture Minister Albero has had to resign as a 
result of irregularities that also concerned him personally. 
Former Bank of Spain Governor Rubio has gone to prison, and Mr. 
Solchaga, the former economy minister and chairman of the 
Socialist group in the Congress of Deputies, has had to tender 
his resignation; Mr. Solchaga's predecessor, Mr. Boyer, also a 
former economy minister, has been charged in the Ibercorp 
affair, and former Interior Minister Mr. Corcuera has also had 
to relinquish his political posts and his seat. I believe that 
you will agree with me that this is not bad for 15 days. 
Despite this, Mr. Gonzalez was asserting only yesterday that 
the country's stability and governability are fully guaranteed. 
  ``But I believe that the truth is that as long as Mr. 
Gonzalez remains in the government, instability in Spain is 
guaranteed, with all the negative consequences that this 
entails. I repeat that the only decent and most honorable 
solution -- the only one that Mr. Gonzalez has -- is to 
relinquish his post. The key to the situation and to 
surmounting the situation lies precisely in Mr. Gonzalez' 
resignation. 
  ``I also wish to point out that following the prime 
minister's appearance yesterday, there could be some citizens 
who think otherwise. I wish to point out that I did not appoint 
Roldan, Mr. Gonzalez did; that I did not appoint Asuncion, Mr. 
Gonzalez did; that I did not appoint Albero, Mr. Gonzalez did; 
that I did not appoint Solchaga, Mr. Gonzalez did; that I did 
not appoint Rubio, Mr. Gonzalez did; that I did not appoint 
Boyer, Mr. Gonzalez did; and that I did not appoint Corcuera, 
Mr. Gonzalez did. To seek to present himself to the public as 
the champion of the struggle against corruption in Spain is an 
absolutely incredible aim. To believe that the man responsible 
for creating a political and moral atmosphere that has led us to 
the extremely grave situation of political crisis that is very 
gravely affecting Spain's prestige abroad and is affecting our 
institutions' dignity can champion the struggle against 
corruption is essentially, as I say, impossible. If I may say 
so, it is as if a man burning down the woods somewhere in Spain 
were to claim to be the chief fireman. But I will say more; 
namely, that, in my opinion, there is no will, nor can there be 
any will, to combat corruption. It should be recalled that the 
Filesa affair, which was discussed in the state of the nation 
debate, is alive and present, and it should be recalled 
especially that the Socialist group voted against setting up a 
committee of inquiry into the Filesa affair. Only yesterday, 
the Socialist parliamentary group, following instructions from 
its top leader, Felipe Gonzalez, prevented Deputy Prime Minister 
Serra from appearing before the committee of inquiry into the 
Roldan affair. It may be asked here, what is feared from Mr. 
Serra's appearance? Is there something to be feared, or does 
the appearance before the committee of inquiry into the Roldan 
affair of one of the people jointly responsible for Mr. Roldan's 
appointment show me a desire to clarify matters? I wish to 
recall that Mr. Roldan's appointment was undoubtedly furthered, 
when he was nominated, by the then interior minister and by the 
current deputy prime minister, who was defense minister at that 
time. Why is that appearance being prevented? So there is no 
credibility, nor can there be, nor will the incredible claim to 
champion the struggle against corruption exist. 
<H5>  Without Authority </H5>
  ``Mr. Gonzalez looks right now like a hostage in the Moncloa 
Palace, at the mercy of events that he is unable to control and, 
in my opinion, without any authority to surmount the country's 
situation right now. His decision to entrench himself, his 
decision to resist at whatever cost, and his well-established 
aim to set his personal interests above the interests of Spanish 
democracy and of Spain represent a heavy cost for our country, 
from which it will take us some time to recover and that will 
require an extraordinary effort by the whole of Spanish society. 
Mr. Gonzalez' stance right now of entrenching himself, as I say, 
in the Moncloa Palace, at the mercy of events or as the hostage 
of any kind of pressure does not seem to me a stance that shows 
even a little magnanimity or the minimum sense of the state to 
be expected. I do not believe that Spain and the Spanish people 
deserve to pay that very high price and that very high cost that 
is being paid in terms of credibility and in terms of future 
prospects for our country. 
  ``In any event, I wish to conclude by saying in this 
introduction that there is an opportunity for Spanish citizens 
12 June, and I hope and wish that for the good of our democracy, 
whose institutions we have a duty to safeguard, preserve, and 
strengthen, and especially for the sake of Spain's national 
interest -- which is, at least for myself and for my party, and 
for many millions of Spanish people what concerns us most -- 
that Spanish citizens will take the opportunity to react and 
begin a new course in Spain's modern and contemporary history. 
Many thanks; I am now at your disposal.'' 
<H5>  He "Did Not Tell Truth" </H5>
  [ABC] I would like to ask you two questions. The first is 
what is your political opinion of Felipe Gonzalez' constant 
allusions to social alarm, which is the refrain that we have 
been hearing from Socialist spokesmen for days? What do you 
understand by social alarm? The second is whether you believe 
that the stance of [Catalan president] Mr. Pujol and [Basque 
Nationalist Party Chairman] Mr. Arzalluz of propping up Felipe 
Gonzalez in the government in return for perquisites concerning 
autonomy endangers Spain's general interests. 
  [Aznar] Let us take it step-by-step. In the first place, I 
would have liked to be in the Congress of Deputies yesterday. I 
believe that there should have been a debate in the Congress. 
That was what the People's Party demanded. I say this because 
it seems to me a sound rule in any democracy to appear in 
parliament when you hold responsibility for the prime 
ministership. To state that you are appearing before the news 
media because there is a situation of social alarm, at the same 
time as stating that you are not appearing in the Congress of 
Deputies because that appearance would create social alarm, is 
really odd from the democratic viewpoint. I would have liked 
that debate to have been held in the Congress of Deputies. 
  I say this in order to add that yesterday Mr. Gonzalez did 
not tell the truth, lied when he said that the People's Party 
opposed his appearance. It has not opposed Mr. Gonzalez' 
appearance next Wednesday [11 May]; what we wanted was for him 
to appear yesterday, since we democratically believed that it is 
his responsibility. Mr. Gonzalez has gravely jeopardized 
Spain's prestige abroad and the democratic institutions' very 
dignity. It is that essential responsibility for creating that 
atmosphere of debasement and deterioration that must be 
substantiated right now, and in our opinion, it is to be 
substantiated by Mr. Gonzalez' relinquishment of the prime 
ministership. I believe that Gonzalez is not clearly in control 
of his situation and that he is a hostage to any kind of 
pressure that he may suffer, whether it be statements by 
fugitives such as Roldan or any other action that could take 
place within Spain in political terms. 
  Second, you ask me about some nationalist parties' stance. I 
have the impression that there is an increasing number of 
nationalist voters in Catalonia or the Basque Country -- mainly 
voters for Convergence and Union (CiU), which is maintaining the 
situation -- who are wondering why that stance is being 
maintained, why the support for the current government is being 
maintained in such a really debased and grave situation. I feel 
very close to those voters who can find no justification for 
maintaining that stance, who can find no justification for the 
presumed call for governability and stability resulting in the 
history of Spain over the past 15 days that I have given you. 
  [ABC] Since it has been confirmed that the nationalists 
are continuing to support Mr. Gonzalez for the present, do you 
not believe that the time has come to set aside any other kind 
of interests and submit a censure motion now, even if it is lost? 
  [Aznar] Mr. Pujol, Mr. Arzalluz, and [United Left 
Coordinator General] Mr. Anguita have explicitly stated that 
they are not prepared to support a censure motion. I am not 
here in order to make any empty gestures or to have a good time. 
I am here to help resolve Spanish citizens' problems, and a 
censure motion that will not be supported would solve no problem 
but could give many of them, who wish to change the situation, a 
feeling of frustration. The country is no mood for pointless 
exercises. It is clearly in favor of accepting responsibilities 
and of taking decisions that will guarantee that we regain 
international prestige, that our economy does not suffer, as it 
has been suffering alarmingly over the past few days, from Mr. 
Gonzalez' staying in the government, and, of course, that the 
institutions and their strength are able to offer a reasonable 
solution to the current crisis. And a censure motion will not 
give this right now. If you ask me whether I rule it out, I 
will say "no," but my duty is to seek solutions to the country's 
situation. 
  [ABC] The prime minister stated yesterday that he does not 
rule out a confidence motion. He also made an allusion to 
yourself, to the effect that there is no longer the harmony of 
some months ago. It is certainly apparent from your words that 
there is reciprocity. Could there be a rapprochement between 
the two of you again? 
<H5>  Confidence Motion </H5>
  [Aznar] On the submitting of a confidence motion, it is a 
responsibility that rests with the government. In Spain's 
recent history, there was one in 1990. So it is the government 
that must assess whether or not a confidence motion will be 
submitted. Taking up again a previous reply, I have the 
impression that if the government's greatest source of support 
is not interested in a confidence motion, the government will 
not have much interest in it, either. So I do not expect much 
from that, or rather, anything. I emphasize again that the only 
decent and honorable solution right now would be for Gonzalez to 
tender his resignation. What I do wish to say is that what was 
stated by Mr. Gonzalez yesterday is clear frivolity, because to 
say that confidence motions are submitted when there is no 
confidence is a sign that it is not true. That is 
constitutionally inaccurate and politically dull. Confidence 
motions are submitted in order to secure a parliamentary 
relegitimization. Now if Mr. Gonzalez believes that he does not 
need parliamentary relegitimization because he has a 
relegitimization by telephone, then I emphasize again that these 
are odd methods of democratic understanding. But, I repeat, it 
is not for me to make that decision. It is for the government 
and Mr. Gonzalez. The second question was about channels of 
communication. I will tell you quite frankly that there are 
always channels of communication. There is a permanent formal 
channel of communication that is parliament, and there are 
others that, if they serve for having relegitimizations by 
telephone, serve for establishing channels of communication. 
Mr. Gonzalez' channel of communication with me is as simple as 
picking up the telephone and phoning. And whenever he has done 
so, he has obtained a positive response. I will tell you more; 
I will tell you a short story, and, generous, they tell lies 
like the rest of us breathe. [sentence as published] You know 
that I recently visited Morocco. I discussed that visit with 
Gonzalez on several occasions. One my return, one of the phone 
calls that I made was to Mr. Gonzalez: I have had these 
political talks; when you deem it opportune, I am at your 
disposal to give you my impressions and the contents of those 
talks. I am still waiting. Channel of communication? 
  [ABC] You have spoken of channels of communication with the 
government and of institutions that we must safeguard. Is it 
possible that that channel of communication that is as simple as 
picking up the telephone will make it possible for the the talks 
on the famous democratic impetus to be resumed and for there to 
be agreement on the ombudsman and other institutions? 
  [Aznar] With respect to the first question, I will say that 
I do not know. All that I do know is that right now, if the 
People's Party had accepted the formula proposed by the 
government for parliamentary committees of inquiry, there would 
have been no committee of inquiry into the Roldan affair, just 
as there is no appearance by Deputy Prime Minister Mr. Serra, 
just as there is no committee of inquiry into the Filesa affair, 
just as after two years in the Ibercorp affair, we find that 
there could also be a large majority of Spanish people who are 
cheerfully prepared to accept that the jailings of some people 
over the past few days is a coincidence. They coincided one day 
exactly before Gonzalez' appearance at a news conference. By 
chance. I can tell you that the People's Party's intention 
right now, however many the difficulties may be, remains the 
same one with which we began those talks, which are something 
that concerns us right now, bearing in mind the objective harm 
that Mr. Gonzalez' staying in the government is doing to our 
country's political and institutional credibility. To transform 
a personal leadership crisis into a national political crisis is 
an extremely grave responsibility. And to cling to power, 
rejecting any solution, seems to me another extremely grave 
responsibility that should be clearly taken up again. And I 
hope that it will be taken up again. 
  Second, the matter of the political responsibilities. I 
said in the state of the nation debate that we are acting very 
vigorously, from calling for committees of inquiry to demanding 
certain people's dismissal or resignation. And here it is not 
so much a matter of the responsibility for the appointment of 
one or two people. It is a matter of the general state of 
debasement of Spanish life. It is a matter of the 
responsibility for creating the most politically and morally 
debased atmosphere that Spain has had in many years. That is 
the responsibility that Mr. Gonzalez cannot evade. I have said 
it before. The man who is responsible for sheltering and 
tolerating that atmosphere of corruption cannot champion the 
struggle against corruption, and his staying on is a mistake. 
  [ABC] I would like to know why the People's Party believes 
that having a Socialist other than Gonzalez as prime minister 
would provide greater stability or resolve the crisis. I would 
also like to know whose hostage Felipe Gonzalez is in the 
Moncloa Palace and whether you have spoken recently with the 
Generalitat president or with the Basque Nationalist Party 
chairman. 
  [Aznar] I have spoken with neither this week. To demand the 
prime minister's resignation, especially because of his 
responsibility for creating this atmosphere of political and 
institutional corruption, is not exactly something pleasant. 
The only thing for which you can hope is that there will be 
sufficient magnanimity to be able to set Spanish democracy and 
Spain's interests above personal interests. Of course, we all 
agree that Mr. Gonzalez is not attached to his post -- we are 
convinced of that -- but since he is not attached to his post, 
he should show it a little. 
  And if Mr. Gonzalez has a doubt, it is quite simple; he can 
call an election when he pleases. Not now, because it is not 
legally possible, but as soon as it is legally possible, he can 
call it, and he will see how the public interprets his spurious 
appeals in these matters. 
<H5>  Offer of Change </H5>
  [ABC] Do you not believe that you are in danger of becoming 
ineffective through repeating so often the demand for Gonzalez' 
resignation? Are you not also in danger of giving the 
impression that that the only thing that is being done is to 
wait for the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] to die of 
sheer scandal? 
  [Aznar] My problem is to offer the public a solution. What 
is the best right now? The best is Mr. Gonzalez' resignation. 
I would greatly like to change Spain's situation tomorrow, but 
I wish to point out that 10 months ago there was an election in 
which the PSOE won the majority, and I also wish to point out 
that those who could support a censure motion do not wish to do 
so. The solutions to the country's situation are those that we 
offer. If Gonzalez says: "I will not resign, and there will be 
no confidence motion and no election," that is his affair, but I 
do not believe that that is to give the country a solution. 
  [ABC] What is your interpretation of Congress Speaker Felix 
Pons' analysis, in which he asserts that the easiest solution 
for you is to demand the prime minister's resignation and thus 
lay bare the Socialist election poster? 
  [Aznar] I ask you to hold me responsible for what I am -- 
not what I am not. Pujol -- not I -- makes his decisions, and 
Mr. Arzalluz makes his decisions. I tackle this situation in 
the way that I deem most advisable for the country.

  [Text] German citizen Hans Koschnick, the European Union 
[EU] administrator of the Bosnian city of Mostar, is in our 
country. First thing this morning he met the foreign minister, 
and now he is meeting Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas. 
Now we go over to Pedro Fernandez Cespedes. Good afternoon. 
  [Cespedes] Good afternoon. While waiting for Croats and 
Muslims to complete the initial agreement that is now being 
discussed in Vienna, Foreign Minister Javier Solana has offered 
Hans Koschnick, the EU administrator of the city of Mostar and 
former mayor of Bremen, all the help that Spain could possibly 
give so as to establish a close working relationship. 
  [Begin Solana recording] The EU has a lot at stake here. Why 
is there so much at stake? Because we have taken on a vast 
responsibility, that of pacifying a city and then rebuilding it. 
And we are not talking about just any city, it is the second 
city in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the first one being Sarajevo -- 
the second one is Mostar. And it has its own specific problems. 
[end recording] 
  [Cespedes] Spanish businessmen will work toward the 
rebuilding of Mostar, a city they have already visited. This is 
going to be the reward for the big effort made by Spain in 
former Yugoslavia. Fifty Civil Guardsmen might take part in the 
future police force deployed in the capital of Herzegovina 
[Mostar]. This would happen if it is decided that the police 
force is 400 men strong. 
  However both the defense minister, who will meet Mr. 
Koschnick this afternoon, and Javier Solana would like to see EU 
participation in this contingent be as small as possible 
considering that there are already Spanish Blue Helmets in the 
area. 
  [Begin Solana recording] And then we shall try to see the 
old 
security forces, the former police force, reestablished -- try 
to restore them so that they learn to live together and that 
will be a first step towards real pacification. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Bjarne Nitovuori: "Center's Heated EU Fight Did </F>
Not Take Place"] 
  [Excerpts] Despite the speculations beforehand, European 
Union [EU] did not become the major battle issue at the meeting 
of the Center Party delegation in Tornio yesterday. The question 
was touched upon just briefly, at least during the first day of 
the meeting. 
  There was even less debate about former party leader Paavo 
Vayrynen's recent proposal that the EU membership should be 
postponed for a few years. 
  Vayrynen himself had earlier promised to participate in the 
debate only if he was asked. No one put any questions to him. A 
few speakers made a few snide remarks about Vayrynen, but he did 
not allow himself to be provoked. 
  At yesterday's news conference Prime Minister Esko Aho, the 
party chairman, explained the absence of a passionate EU debate 
by the fact that EU is not an issue that divides the party, that 
regardless of their position on the EU the members regard the 
Center Party as the best channel for influence. 
<H5>  Resigned Opponents </H5>
  Yesterday's debate gave an indication that the categorical 
EU 
opposition in fact is rather weak within the party. A large 
number of those who have opposed joining the EU have resigned 
themselves to it and are more intent on making the best of the 
situation, on minimizing the damage from a membership. [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  Draft Program Changed </H5>
  If the EU debate in the delegation was unusually tame, it 
was 
said to have been all the more lively at the party executive 
committee on Friday [22 April] and yesterday morning, when a 
draft program, to be approved by the party congress in Jyvaskyla 
in July, was discussed. 
  In a previous draft it was stated that "Finland supports the 
development a European union, which expands, opens up and 
gradually deepens and functions according to the subsidiarity 
principle." 
  But at the discussion by the party executive committee the 
expression "European union" was eliminated and replaced by 
"European cooperation." This was in order for the program to 
apply regardless of whether Finland becomes an EU member or 
whether one is satisfied with the EEA [European Economic Area] 
solution, explained activity leader Seppo Niemela, who has 
headed the program work. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by FNB: "Kivela Fears Collision With Center"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The brewing dissatisfaction within the 
Conservatives Party over the Center politicians' actions, 
primarily on the European Union [EU] issue, on Sunday [17 April] 
caused open expressions from the party leadership as well. Party 
secretary Pekka Kivela said in a speech in Kouvola that the 
major government parties will very soon end up on a collision 
course, unless it is possible to find a common view. 
  The crash is looming due to the Center's acrobatics on the 
EU 
issue as well as to statements by Center politicians regarding 
increased taxation. 
  Kivela said that Center Party statements favoring a 
postponement of EU membership "from a factual viewpoint means a 
rejection of membership." At the same time the Center Party's 
finance minister is taking a negative standpoint on the need for 
tax cuts and in favor of increased taxation of business activity 
through a higher energy tax, among others. 
  "Finland's EU membership is a necessity if a favorable 
economic development is to be assured in the future. Increased 
taxation would, in turn, lead to undermining of the positive 
turnaround in economic development that has already happened. 
The Conservative Party cannot be a part of promoting such a 
policy," Kivela stated. 
  The Conservative Party therefore takes for granted that the 
government should without delay make a decision about the date 
for the national referendum on the EU and about the compensating 
national subsidy measures in connection with the EU agreement. 
Decisions must also be made in May about the budget framework 
for next year, so that measures for easing income taxes can be 
carried out even this year. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  EU Report Needed </H5>
  Member of parliament Tarja Halonen (Social Democrat) demands 
a short, balanced, comprehensive study of the negotiating result 
with the EU and its effects. But the government itself should 
also take a position on such a study, she says. 
  In Halonen's opinion, the Finnish Government, compared to 
the 
government of the other applicant nations, has acted in an 
unusually self-satisfied manner. In Sweden, for example, one has 
tried harder to keep the Riksdag up to date during the 
negotiations. Halonen also wonders how the government, with its 
internal confusion, will even be able to come to a decision on 
the EU question. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Tuomo Lappalainen: "Parliament: Foreign Policy </F>
Minor Role Performers; International Duties Take Up Increasingly 
More of Members of Parliament's Time"] 
  [Text] The seminar at which Russia's membership on the 
Council of Europe was discussed and that brought Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy to Finland also again gave rise to a discussion of 
parliament's foreign policy role. 
  The 10-member delegation of members of parliament 
representing Finland on the council hosted the seminar. 
Delegation chairman Olli Rehn (Center Party) thought up the idea 
of organizing it. 
  In the course of time the sizable network of groups 
occupying 
themselves with international affairs in parliament has grown. 
At the present time many members of parliament also have foreign 
policy duties either on official committees or delegations or in 
various friendship groups. 
  Headed by Pertti Paasio (Social Democrat), the Foreign 
Affairs Committee has retained its leading position as a 
parliamentary monitor. The changed international situation has, 
however, also strengthened the Defense Committee's foreign 
policy role. As for that big committee, it is now being turned 
into an integration committee that deals with EEA [European 
Economic Area] and in future EU [European Union] affairs. 
  Furthermore, delegations have been separately appointed in 
parliament in the EEA and EFTA [European Free Trade Association] 
members of parliament committees, the Council of Europe, the 
Nordic Council, the CSCE Parliamentary General Assembly, and the 
Interparliamentary Union (IPU). The Joint Finnish and European 
Parliaments Committee was formed over a year ago to keep track 
of the progress of the EU negotiations. 
  Since last year, Paasio and Kalevi Lamminen (Conservative), 
the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Defense 
Committee, have been participating as observers at Western 
European Union (WEU) members of parliament meetings. Eeva 
Kuuskoski has been representing the Finnish parliament in the 
North Atlantic Assembly, an organ corresponding to NATO. 
  Those members of parliament who are most active in terms of 
foreign policy simultaneously participate in many of the 
committees and delegations: Kimmo Sasi (Conservative) in six of 
them and Centrists Sirkka-Liisa Anttila, Juha Korkeaoja, and 
Mirjas Ryynanen, as well as Social Democrat Erkki Tuomioja in 
five of them. Olli Rehn, Jorn Donner (Swedish People's Party), 
and Ilkka Suominen (Conservative), who will be leaving 
parliament in May, each head two delegations. 
  This heightening of parliament's standing in the handling of 
foreign affairs is not only a Finnish phenomenon; the same thing 
has in fact been happening in many European countries. In 
Finland, however, this development has been progressing in a 
surprisingly smooth fashion. Members of parliament have avoided 
interfering in matters of a sensitive nature without consulting 
the Foreign Ministry beforehand. Zhirinovskiy's visit also had 
the Foreign Ministry's blessing. 
  However, a small territorial struggle arose on Arkadianmaki 
[parliament location] between the Foreign Affairs Committee 
(UAV) and the new delegations. In an unpublished official report 
drafted last December, the parliamentary International Affairs 
Committee alludes, among other things, to the UAV's desire to 
"strengthen the link" between it and the CSCE Members of 
Parliament Delegation. The same members of parliament -- and, in 
addition, the speaker of parliament -- are currently 
representing Finland at CSCE Parliamentary General Assembly 
meetings as are on the Council of Europe. 
<H5>  Friendship Across Borders </H5>
  In parliament there are at present about 30 friendship 
groups 
with various countries. In addition to the most important 
European countries, China, Japan, Cuba, Israel, and Nicaragua, 
among others, have acquired their own groups. Most of them were 
formed after the mid-1980's. The oldest of them, the 
Finland-Korea group, has been active since 1974. 
  In its report the International Affairs Committee also dealt 
with friendship groups. It expressed the opinion that members of 
parliament's activities built "on voluntary participation" were 
still necessary "because friendship groups enable us to more 
closely observe the countries involved, to enter into closer 
relations with the embassies of the countries in question, and 
to play host in parliament to the delegations arriving from 
these countries." 
  Estonia has the largest friendship group -- over 50 members 
of parliament. About 40 members of parliament belong to each 
group involving the Arab nations, South Africa, China, and 
Hungary. 
  The groups' political power relations vary considerably. The 
entire Christian League parliamentary delegation is in the 
Israel group, but only one leftist, Aarno von Bell (Social 
Democrat), is. There are as many Left Leaguers in the Cuba group 
as members of all the other parties together. 
  Parliament's backbenchers also get a chance to give vent to 
their foreign policy activism in the friendship groups. Pekka 
Leppanen (Left League) belongs to 14 groups, Riitta Kamppinen 
(Center Party) and veteran Ensio Laine (Left League) to 13, and 
Hannu Kemppainen (Center Party) and Eeva-Liisa Moilanen 
(Christian League) to 11. 
  Influential heavyweight members of parliament demonstrate 
their friendship much more selectively. Paavo Vayrynen is a 
member of only the Albania group and Esko Aho of only the South 
Africa group opposed to racial oppression, while Paavo Lipponen 
belongs to no group at all.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Romantschuk: "Finnish Mediation Discussed </F>
During Rybkin's Visit"] 
  [Text] Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the Russian parliament's 
lower house, the Duma, thinks it would be good if Finland could 
mediate in the conflict between Russia and Estonia regarding the 
withdrawal of the Russian troops from Estonian territory. 
  The question of troop withdrawals and potential Finnish 
mediation was on the agenda during the speaker's visit to 
Finland, which was concluded yesterday. 
  "I think it would be quite good," said Speaker Rybkin and 
said that it could be useful to have a third party in the 
negotiations between Russia and Estonia. 
  This, at least, was the conclusion that could be drawn from 
the not too complete interpretation of Rybkin's message. 
  The negotiations between Russia and Estonia have not been 
completely suspended, but they also have not progressed. Russia 
has pledged to withdraw its troops from the Baltic states by the 
last day of August of this year. But no agreement with Estonia 
has been reached as yet. The fact that the troop withdrawal can 
be accomplished according to the established timetable is one of 
the conditions for Russia's acceptance by the European Council. 
  The Russians have not submitted any actual appeal for 
mediation help, but the question was discussed with both 
President Martti Ahtisaari, Prime Minister Esko Aho, and Foreign 
Minister Heikki Haavisto. 
  Rybkin did not want to enter into how the Finnish hosts 
reacted to the question. 
  Aho has previously taken a reserved position on a potential 
mediation task, while President Ahtisaari has said that if 
Finnish advice is needed the question must be treated seriously. 
  In any event, Ivan Rybkin is of the opinion that the sooner 
the Russian troops are gone from the Baltic the better. 
  "Best of all would be if not a single Russian soldier 
remained outside the borders of Russia." 
<H5>  PFP Should Be Like a Family </H5>
  The situation in Bosnia was also touched upon in the 
conversations with the Finnish hosts. 
  An issue that was discussed at the news conference before 
the 
departure to Moscow was the negative Russian attitude right now 
to the Partnership for Peace, PFP. 
  "Partnership means good relations, as in a family. In a good 
family one usually tells the others where one goes and what one 
does," said Rybkin. 
  Rybkin represents the opinion that the partnership presumes 
negotiations between the parties. When NATO, blessed by the UN 
Security Council, went to the attack against Serbian troops in 
Bosnia, the Security Council's members had not been informed 
when the attack was to take place. 
  "We know that the attack was carried out without the 
consultations that are required by the Security Council," Rybkin 
said. 
  The Russian speaker's three-day visit was concluded last 
night.

been in force against Bosnian Muslims. The foreign minister was 
reacting to the U.S. Senate's Thursday [12 May] vote for lifting 
the sanctions. She says she believes that this would lead to an 
escalation of the war there and that could endanger civilians 
and the peace-keeping troops, including the Nordic battalions. 
The U.S. decision cannot be made law until its other 
legislative arm, the House of Representatives, also passes the 
controversial bill.

    [Editorial Report] Local politicians in northern Sweden 
are concerned that they will receive less regional aid than they 
had thought under the European Union [EU] accession agreement. 
According to a report by Lena Hemmel in the 22 April Swedish 
SVENSKA DAGBLADET on page 18, Sweden is earmarked to receive 2.4 
billion kronor in regional aid -- 360 million under the 
Objective 6 program, and the northern provinces thought that 
they were also entitled to seek aid from the other 2 billion. 
In what they regard as at best a misunderstanding and at worst 
a betrayal, they have now discovered that they are not. A local 
politician in the town of Vilhelmina called the accession 
agreement "worse than the worst imaginable." He expressed 
concern that "there can be other hidden problems that they 
[government negotiators] wanted to cover up and that will come 
up once the referendum is over and we are already in the 
system." Georg Andersson, the former Social Democratic 
communication minister and now a member of parliament from the 
northern town of Lycksele, said: "This is negative, very 
negative...it does not improve the climate of opinion on EU 
accession. Many people have placed great weight on regional 
policy."

  [Text] A second Council of Ministers meeting has been 
concluded. At the top of the agenda was the government's 
program and the appointment of the undersecretaries of state. 
Mario De Scalzi reports from Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime 
minister]. 
  [Begin De Scalzi recording] The Council of Ministers has 
appointed 37 undersecretaries: 13 of them come from Forza 
Italia, 12 from the National Alliance, 10 from the Northern 
League, and two from the Christian Democrat Center [CCD]. 
However, the CCD has managed to obtain a very high profile 
appointment that is on a par with a ministry, in other words, 
civil protection which will now be headed by Ombretta Fumagalli 
Carulli. 
  The Council of Ministers also discussed the government's 
program that will be announced on Monday [16 May] by Silvio 
Berlusconi to the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies in order to 
obtain the support of the parliament. 
  So far, there have been few leaks about the contents of the 
program. What is known, is that the program document is at 
least 50 pages long. The main topics will be employment, fiscal 
policy, and privatization. The latter will, however, have to be 
carried out within the framework of the regulations approved by 
the old government that are valid until 30 May. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Francesco Pionati--recorded] </F>
  [Begin Pionati recording] The efforts to find the votes are 
continuing ceaselessly. In 48 hours, the government will go to 
the Senate in order to begin the debate on the confidence 
motion. On paper, the votes in favor of the Freedom Alliance 
are scant. The stakes are high and Umberto Bossi and Gianfranco 
Fini are not mincing their words: Either the government obtains 
the vote of the Senate, or new elections will be called. 
  In the Freedom Alliance there is great optimism, despite the 
dramatic tones of Bossi and Fini. Silvio Berlusconi is the 
first to be convinced that at the end of the day many senators 
from the Center and the Left will give his government the 
go-ahead. All this despite the fact that Achille Occhetto, in 
the name of the Party of the Democratic Left, has rejected any 
talk of collaboration--on the contrary, announcing that 
opposition to the government will be firm. The picture from the 
Center is, however, a lot less clear. The Italian Popular Party 
[PPI] is divided: Officially both the party leaders at its 
headquarters at Piazza del Gesu and Nicola Mancino, the party's 
Senate caucus leader, stress that the PPI will vote against the 
government, as was decided before the election and as was 
promised to the electorate. The party says that collaboration 
with Forza Italia is possible, but certainly not at present. 
  However, it seems that Forza Italia is making headway in the 
party ranks. For the time being only individual (?senators) 
have spoken tentatively of support, but the actual situation 
will only emerge at the vote. One of the theories put forward 
by Rocco Buttiglione and Roberto Formigoni is to abstain from 
voting in order to allow the government, albeit with a reduced 
quorum, to win the confidence motion. Ciarico de Mita has said 
that this will lead to the dissolution of the PPI. Instead, he 
floated his own idea: The PPI has to vote as a united front 
against the government so that Berlusconi is rejected by the 
Senate. However, newe elections would not be called because the 
largest party had the right and the duty to govern--although 
under different conditions. De Mita's objective is to have a 
government headed by a Berlusconi who would break with the Right 
in order to form an alliance with the PPI. The idea is 
appealing, but it would be very difficult to put into practice.

  [Text] "If there are any attempts to `take away' confidence 
in the government during the Senate vote, then the Northern 
League will ask for immediate elections." The statement was 
made by Umberto Bossi, the leader of the Northern League, who 
added that the "alliance currently in office was the only one 
capable of providing a democratic government." 
  Bossi said that the opposition would have "to bear the 
responsibility of provoking fresh elections, which would not 
only impose on the country an irresolvable and dangerous crisis, 
but would also go against the will of the the Italian people who 
expressed their will at the ballot box."

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto </F>
Bossi by Alessandro Caprettini in Rome; date not given: "I Won 
Using the Partridge Strategy"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The partridge strategy. This is how 
[Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi laughingly defines the 
tactics used to take possession of the Viminale [Interior 
Ministry] without meeting any resistance and above all without 
allowing [President] Scalfaro to knock down the [Interior 
Minister] Maroni's aim for the Viminale. "I learned about this 
from some hunter friends of mine," he explains. "Never keep 
still and in the firing line. Jump from one side to the other 
before they can shoot you." 
  [Caprettini] Okay, you feel like joking. Could you explain 
instead why Scalfaro gave the go-ahead on Maroni in the end. 
  [Bossi] I am not joking at all. I realized that there is 
some prejudices against the League. My problem was to move this 
from the Interior Ministry to the Justice Ministry. This is 
where the partridge strategy comes into play. I let go on one 
position and took on another making them believe that I would 
never let go. At that point somebody decided to shoot...and hit 
[Justice Minister] Previti! 
  [Caprettini] Are you satisfied with the results of the 
assault on the government? Five ministries and good ones too? 
  [Bossi] Satisfied, where? Since when? We got a lot less 
than what was due us. 
  [Caprettini] Come on Bossi, be serious! 
  [Bossi] I am. Tell me: Do you know what really counts in 
these things? 
  [Caprettini] What? 
  [Bossi] The money! And I do not have even one ministry with 
a spending budget! (At this point Bossi starts laughing, and 
shows instead that he is really satisfied with how the talks 
with [Prime Minister] Berlusconi, [National Alliance leader] 
Fini and Scalfaro went). Understand? Not even one ministry 
with a spending budget. 
  [Caprettini] You have enough to console yourself with 
though. 
  [Bossi] Yes. I like the idea that we were given the planning 
ministries; ministries with which you can build the future of 
the country. We have ministries that are a guarantee, Interior, 
Industry, and Budget. We have the Institutional Reform Ministry 
that will guarantee a federalist change and we have an 
international range with the Community Policy Ministry. 
  [Caprettini] With the Interior Ministry in your hands will 
you give up plans for a local autonomy ministry? 
  [Bossi] An autonomy ministry is still necessary because the 
municipalities must have a reference point. 
  [Caprettini] What do you say to those people who are turning 
up their noses at the sight of Maroni in the Interior Ministry 
and who are saying that they fear for the unity of the country? 
  [Bossi] That on the outside it may seem a miracle that a 
federalist force like the League obtained an Interior Ministry 
in a centralist state. But the League played the game with all 
its heart and those who have a heart win. In the end they 
brought us the Viminale on a silver platter. 
  [Caprettini] But is the unity of Italy guaranteed or not? 
  [Bossi] There is not even any need to underline this. Ours 
is a federalist country. The centralist logic made the sense of 
that history disappear. 
  [Caprettini] Do you consider yourself a winner or not in the 
challenge of the ministries? 
  [Bossi] The winner was the desire for change that comes from 
the grassroots of the country. And we wanted to satisfy this 
desire for change. 
  [Caprettini] Last question, but one of those that count. 
Bossi, how long do you think this government will last? 
  [Bossi] It is a government that will last if it does things. 
If, however, it does not do these things. Well, we will see. 
For me, this government is like a formula-one car that has just 
left the factory and that is getting ready for its test drive.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian National Alliance leader Gianfranco </F>
Fini by Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "One Oscar 
Too Many in the Negotiations"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Guiglia] What was the 
most delicate moment in the formation of the new government? 
  [Fini] Paradoxically when I said that I was perplexed about 
the Northern League at the Viminale [Interior Ministry]. I 
could have said a definite no, but I did not because I was 
against vetoes. The League behaved the same way when it opposed 
Dini as budget minister, but not to the point of making the 
government drown. Everybody did his part in his own way. In 
the end good sense prevailed: [Interior Minister] Maroni 
obviously confirmed that the unity of Italy was not under 
discussion and that our attitude had changed. Delaying things 
would have meant weakening the governing body and doing the Left 
a favor. The Right decided to render its services to the 
nation. We will demonstrate the rest with our ministers who are 
already at work. 
  [Guiglia] Well, the five hours spent in Berlusconi's house 
cannot have been idyllic. What was the bone of contention 
between you and the Knight [Berlusconi nickname]? 
  [Fini] I considered the choice of Previti as justice 
minister 
to be inopportune. Berlusconi was not of the same opinion. In 
those very hours a letter from the head of state arrived 
concerning the "principles" to be respected in the choice of 
ministers. However, the prime minister-designate and myself 
were never at a standoff, not even on the choices of our 
ministries. 
  [Guiglia] What was your reaction to [President] Scalfaro's 
intervention? 
  [Fini] That letter had been announced, but, of course, we 
were curious and wanted to read it word by word. There were no 
vetoes. There was some "batting" as we interpreted it. 
  [Guiglia] But did the head of state do the right thing by 
writing or not? 
  [Fini] It did not matter. It was something for future 
reference. Berlusconi did well to tell Maroni to "ideally sign" 
his confirmation. 
  [Guiglia] What weight did Scalfaro have in the negotiations? 
  [Fini] He had some weight. 
  [Guiglia] New Chamber of Deputies and Senate speakers, new 
government, new legislature. Can the "old" president stay at 
the Quirinale [office of the president]? 
  [Fini] This is not on the agenda. 
  [Guiglia] Not on the agenda or not a problem? 
  [Fini] I have already answered. 
  [Guiglia] How do you judge [League Secretary] Bossi and 
Berlusconi after 10 days of repeated face-to-face encounters. 
  [Fini] I think I have discovered that Bossi is by no means 
superficial, even though at times he expresses himself in a 
simple or simplistic manner. As for Berlusconi, he is an 
unusual businessman: He talks a great deal but he also listens 
a great deal. He is incredibly patient, an able mediator. 
  [Guiglia] Are you dealing out compliments to make the 
government last? 
  [Fini] There is no need to. Either the boat continues to go 
ahead or it sinks and we all drown. The government was born 
under a common banner of respect and responsibility. 
  [Guiglia] What were the "real" steps in the turning point of 
the MSI [Italian Social Movement]? 
  [Fini] The list could begin with a good MSI performance on 5 
April 1992. However, it was [former President] Cossiga's blows 
and the bribery scandals that acted as the detonators of a 
corrupt and party-system regime. The last shiver I felt was on 
11 December when I announced to the central committee that I had 
gone to the Fosse Ardeatine [site of Nazi retaliation 
slaughter]. Would the response be an embarrassing silence or 
applause? They responded with applause and with a standing 
ovation; at least most stood. This was when National Alliance 
was born, and I was certain that the MSI would have followed me. 
To the Palazzo Chigi [government seat].

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi by Luigi </F>
Varalli in Rome on 11 May: "I Will Separate Politics and 
Justice"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Varalli] Does the 
Justice Ministry scare you? 
  [Biondi] No. I may have been naive, but I hoped to be able 
to take a short rest. 
  [Varalli] What happened in the exchange with Previti [tipped 
as justice minister]? 
  [Biondi] It all happened at 0400 hours yesterday. Prime 
Minister Berlusconi called me and asked whether I was willing. 
I had already stated my willingness; that seemed to me a 
professional decision. 
  [Varalli] So had you already told Berlusconi that you 
preferred Justice to Defense? 
  [Biondi] When he asked if I would be available at the 
outset, 
and if so, for what, I told him that I would prefer, if 
possible, to deal with the things that I have always loved -- 
justice, defense, domestic affairs, or the environment. And 
when the prime minister informed me that I would be going to the 
Defense Ministry, I was very pleased. 
  [Varalli] So was it not a demotion? 
  [Biondi] No. I have been a defender ever since I was born, 
and to work to ensure that military service is something more 
than a drudgery seemed to me a fine task. 
  [Varalli] But then... 
  [Biondi] Then when he said, the Justice Ministry, I 
certainly 
did not feel as though I had been penalized. 
  [Varalli] Are you not rather afraid of the fact that you 
will 
have to deal with the judiciary, people with whom you are well 
acquainted. 
  [Biondi] Judges must be beyond reproach, by virtue of the 
profession they have chosen. I have had the great pleasure of 
knowing many magistrates, whom I trust implicitly, even if their 
political stances are different from mine. 
  [Varalli] What will be the first thing you do at the 
ministry? 
  [Biondi] First, this afternoon, I will meet again with my 
predecessor, Conso. 
  [Varalli] What next? 
  [Biondi] Then I will make a tour of all Italy's prisons. 
Justice must be fair, and a sentence must be not only a sanction 
but also a reeducation. 
  [Varalli] In recent weeks there has been some controversy 
about the method for reelecting the CSM [Higher Magistrates 
Council] -- a controversy which [President] Scalfaro silenced by 
setting a date for the next election. What do you think about 
this? 
  [Biondi] From the procedural viewpoint, I think that the 
choice of the single-candidate system could provide better 
guarantees. Be that as it may, the president did very well to 
call an election, so to speak. If parliament wants to change 
the law, it can do so. 
  [Varalli] The bribery scandals are another burning issue. 
  [Biondi] Certain investigations should start sooner. Be that 
as it may, better late than never. Something is rotten in 
Denmark, and it must be removed. 
  [Varalli] Are you in favor of a "whitewash" or at least of a 
political solution to the matter? 
  [Biondi] I am an old Liberal in this respect, too. I believe 
that amnesties and pardons after less than five years are things 
of the past and to be avoided, because this creates partial 
justice, and we must be very careful not to create inequality 
among citizens before the law. It is necessary to think 
carefully before reaching any decisions. In any case, I think 
that it is better to follow procedural rather than legislative 
criteria. 
  [Varalli] Have you already received many calls? 
  [Biondi] I did not know I was so popular throughout Italy. I 
have received 6,000 telephone calls. 
  [Varalli] I meant calls from magistrates, from Borrelli, for 
instance. 
  [Biondi] He will call me if he wants. 
  [Varalli] What about Di Pietro? 
  [Biondi] I heard from him about a month ago in connection 
with a trial. 
  [Varalli] Now the tables are turned. 
  [Biondi] No, because there are no conflicts; only calm 
assessments.

<F P=106> [Interview with Giuliano Ferrara, minister of relations with </F>
Parliament, by Aldo De Luca in Rome on 11 May: "Ferrara 
Promises: I Will No Longer Be Reckless; Now I Will Mediate"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [De Luca] How do you 
feel as minister on the first day of the Second Republic? 
  [Ferrara] I feel, so to speak...I feel constrained, but in a 
positive way. I feel constrained to perform a role comprising 
social and institutional roles which, however, are closely 
connected with my interest in and passion for politics. 
  [De Luca] Sgarbi said you joined the government because of a 
5-percent rating. 
  [Ferrara] Well, his is a very telecentric view of the world. 
  [De Luca] Why did Berlusconi suggest this particular 
ministry 
for you? 
  [Ferrara] Actually I requested it, because here it is pure 
politics, and I consider myself an "expert," in quotation marks. 
  [De Luca] Ferrara, the champion of controversy. You said 
recently: I will argue whenever I want, however I want, and 
with whomever I want. 
  [Ferrara] Obviously, if you are paid to argue on television, 
to express your own opinions, you cannot break those rules. 
  [De Luca] Does Ferrara the minister intend to follow the 
same 
rules as Ferrara the polemicist? 
  [Ferrara] Absolutely not. I am bound by the collective 
nature of the government, so I do not intend to engage in 
polemics whenever I may feel like it, with whomever I want. That 
would be stupid. 
  [De Luca] Minister for relations with Parliament is a post 
demanding gifts as a diplomat, a mediator. Do you have these 
qualities? 
  [Ferrara] It is a question of image: People have a false 
impression of me, they believe that I am reckless. That is not 
true. I am a sensible person and I think that I am capable of 
performing the task that awaits me. 
  [De Luca] What is your assessment of the team chosen by 
Prime Minister Berlusconi? 
  [Ferrara] Good, very good. I am very pleased that the 
coalition forces are properly, and not merely symbolically, 
represented in the government. 
  [De Luca] Is it really the government of the new? 
  [Ferrara] It is the newest government that it was possible 
to 
achieve. 
  [De Luca] Does Minister Clemente Mastella, a former 
steadfast 
supporter of [former Christian Democratic Party Secretary 
Ciriaco] De Mita, represent the new, too? 
  [Ferrara] Mr. Mastella is a traditional politician from a 
traditional party, just like many others. 
  [De Luca] Does it feel uncomfortable to be in the same 
government as the postfascists? 
  [Ferrara] No. When the left-wing extremists wanted the 
dissolution of the MSI [Italian Social Movement] I was on the 
other side, because I was a moderate and a reformist. Fini's 
and Tatarella's [both National Alliance] Right is not a problem 
for me. 
  [De Luca] You are perhaps one of the public figures with the 
most nicknames: from Beau Brummel to Fattypotamous, Ghino the 
Turkey, Craxone, Extra Large. Which is your favorite? 
  [Ferrara] Fattypotamous is the friendliest one, the cutest 
one, which was given to me by my friend, Paolo Franchi of 
CORRIERE DELLA SERA, and which Giampaolo Pansa subsequently 
repeated. 
  [De Luca] Would you have preferred to be a minister in a 
government with a prime minister called Bettino Craxi? 
  [Ferrara] If I could have chosen , I would have preferred to 
be a minister with Churchill as prime minister, but I have good 
hopes that Berlusconi will bestow similar merits on the country; 
I say this, of course, with a smile, jokingly. 
  [de Luca] Will you wear your hair neater, shorter? 
  [Ferrara] No, my hair is very neat, very clean, and fine. 
Anyway, it has been like this for years.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rocco Buttiglione, member of the Italian </F>
Popular Party, PPI, by "g.l." in Rome; date not given: "I Am 
Saying We Should Let Them Govern"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [LA REPUBBLICA] Deputy Buttiglione, in your 
opinion, what attitude should the PPI take as regards the vote 
on the government in the Senate? 
  [Buttiglione] We must start with a basic premise. During the 
election campaign, we said that we were asking people to vote 
for us so that we could govern the country, or alternatively, if 
this proved impossible, we would go into opposition. Now, if 
nobody has an absolute majority, as is the case in the Senate, 
this poses a problem. I believe that they will have to reach a 
decision at Palazzo Madama [Senate] by taking one basic fact 
into account: Is a better government than the present one 
available in the foreseeable future? I think we must take a 
responsible attitude, allowing them to govern the country. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] The PPI's "regents," however, do not seem to 
agree with this view. 
  [Buttiglione] I am offering my own opinion. The others must 
then assume responsibility for whatever they decide. In any 
case, I believe the regents are not all that far from my own 
position. Any political force must ask itself whether a better 
government than Berlusconi's is feasible in the foreseeable 
future, and whether early elections would give us a better 
parliament than the existing one. If the answer -- as I believe 
it is -- is "no," then we must appeal to people's sense of 
responsibility. An alternative solution -- although I do not 
know to what extent this would be technically feasible -- might 
be that of bringing down the government, yet giving Berlusconi 
another chance, telling him to attempt to form a better 
government. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Why are you so anxious to establish a 
dialogue with Forza Italia? 
  [Buttiglione] Because we must build up the 
liberal-democratic 
aligment, and this can only be done with moderate forces, by 
breaking up the majority. Forza Italia is a centrist force, but 
in the League there are centrist elements too. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Your line is already giving rise to a 
confrontation within the PPI. Do you agree with holding a 
congress in July, or do you want it to be held earlier? 
  [Buttiglione] If miracles were possible, I would rather we 
had held it yesterday. I think that July may do, but not a day 
later than 8 July. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Will you stand as a candidate for the 
secretariat? 
  [Buttiglione] I will be submitting -- to congress -- a 
political proposal that cannot be simplified to an alliance with 
Forza Italia. I believe that it is right for someone proposing 
a political line to personally assume responsibility for its 
implementation. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Are you not afraid that the PPI may 
definitely disintegrate over the question of its relationship to 
Forza Italia? 
  [Buttiglione] I will make every effort to ensure that it 
stays united. If we really want to build a liberal-democratic 
alignment, we will require all our intelligence and all our 
might. The PPI's problem is not that it has two souls, but 
rather, that it must assimilate the majority system ethos: You 
cannot defend your identity by standing still. Perhaps we ought 
to read again the talents' parable in the Bible.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Achille Occhetto, Democratic Party of the </F>
Left secretary: "Left Wing, Come Out of the Corral"] 
  [Text] The first thing that we can say is that Italy is 
deeply humiliated by this administration: humiliated by its 
quality, which does not reflect the country's cultural and civic 
level, humiliated by the way, which cannot fail to offend us, in 
which the negotiations on the government have been conducted, 
humiliated by the mountain of lies and subterfuges deployed in 
an attempt to conceal the fact that the old system is back with 
us. It is not a matter of acknowledging that if the Right has 
won it is entitled to govern. We have fully acknowledged this 
right. 
  The country's humiliation emerges from something quite 
different: from the lies, from the mockery of the "promises" 
that the Right had made before the voters. We cannot forget 
that the electorate has been tricked into believing in a new 
force opposed to party rule and jockeying for position. A fine 
way of opposing party rule! What we have in the field is a 
party-cum-corporation that dominates the political news and 
electoral propaganda markets, whose Big Brother face stares out 
from the walls of every Italian city, while the free 
associations of men and women known as parties lack the material 
resources to compete in this monstrous, unattainable financial 
challenge. This in itself shows that we are not embarking on 
the second phase of the republic, a reconfigured, pluralistic, 
democratic European country with a majority voting system, but 
that we run the risk of finding ourselves in a sort of republic 
run as a family firm and kept under the thumb of financial and 
media power. 
  An arrogant, cynical power: Indeed, Berlusconi heads the 
list of candidates for the European elections in all five 
constituencies, knowing full well that, as he is prime minister, 
he will have to resign five minutes after he has been elected. 
This is a fraud committed against the voters, who would thus be 
cheated of their vote and called upon to sanction a caricature 
of a plebiscite. 
  Is this supposed to be the advance of change? What really 
confronts us is a government crammed with men linked with the 
old power system, as numerous media commentators have pointed 
out. Of all the many hoaxes, this is the greatest. Can Italy, 
which has been massed for two years in the stands of the great 
multimedia stadium of courtroom politics, shouting its 
indignation at the kickback city scandal, admittedly in an, at 
times, excessively judgmental and vindictive spirit, now fail to 
notice that, when all is said and done, Bossi, despite his many 
feigned protestations, and Fini as well, have brought back to 
power that "second estate" of intrigue that dominated the last 
years of the republic? Everything has been changed to give more 
power to those who already influenced, and at times dominated, 
the transversal politics that had been attempting for some time 
to destroy not party rule -- which was sacrosanct -- but the 
parties of the poor, the chance for the humiliated and oppressed 
to band together to defend themselves. 
  We have heard ministers in this government state shamelessly 
that promises are only made during election campaigns to catch 
votes. Indeed, the dream has already faded: The million jobs 
have faded away; the promise to form a government avoiding long 
drawn-out interparty negotiations has faded away; the promise of 
substantial tax reductions all round has faded away; the 
principle whereby the prime minister-designate would choose the 
ablest men best suited to the jobs, leaving aside considerations 
of party expediency, has faded away. The result staring us in 
the face is not a competent right-wing administration of the 
type that we have seen in France and Britain, with men and women 
of quality. No, this administration is enough to make one shed 
tears of national shame. 
  For us, the opposition, it could well turn out to our 
advantage. But we love our country, and we do not want to see it 
humiliated. We tremble at the mere idea that the forthcoming 
European elections could take this "new" ruling class beyond the 
frontiers of Italy and reveal it for what it is: the worst in 
Italian cunning, opportunism, and demagoguery placed at the 
service of those who have always held power. Indeed, we go into 
Europe with a government to which the president of the republic 
has felt the need to address an anxious admonition, warning it 
against the risk that failure to take a clear stance on issues 
crucial to government policy and to democratic life itself may 
damage the republic both without and within its frontiers, and 
even calling on it not to adopt political positions contrary to 
the principles of freedom and legality fundamental to our 
constitutional charter -- an event of enormous, extraordinary, 
disquieting import! Yet it all ended in a thumbing of noses. 
This is what is so worrying: If the conscience of a nation has 
been mithridatized to this extent, the obscure evil can attack 
and defeat it at any time. 
  But we are convinced that a better Italy has great resources 
and that the match is by no means over. We shall be a definite, 
clear- cut opposition, a democratic opposition, firmly anchored 
to the principles and values of our constitutional charter. 
However, we have not yet reached an alternative-platform stage. 
As has been perspicaciously pointed out, the disquieting 
malaise revealed by the exchange of letters between Scalfaro and 
Berlusconi no longer allows us merely to put ourselves forward 
as the spearhead of a vigorous opposition in a normal 
alternative-platform situation; it has turned us into the 
champions of a democracy that appears to be heading in a 
dangerous direction. Weighty words, but born of the somber, 
unprecedented events leading up to the formation of the 
government. Either Scalfaro was joking, and I rule that out, or 
his words are stones. We regard them as stones to be removed. 
  This is why I feel the need to reply to the boy whose faint 
voice cried, "Wake up, left wing!" on yesterday evening's 
"Milano-Italia" [television current affairs talk show with 
audience participation], because it is not true that we have 
been laid low, there are a lot of us. The Left must wake up, 
drop the false issues, fight off those who increasingly want to 
herd us into a corral and keep us there. A wide-awake Left is 
also a Left that finds the right language to talk to the 60 
percent of Italians on the left and in the center who did not 
vote for the Right. There is already a potential new majority. 
Let us bring it to life, without imposing hegemonies, with due 
respect for individuality, but let us bring it to life, if we 
want Italy to have its hope, self-confidence, and prestige 
restored.

<F P=106> [Elena Polidori report: "Race for Succession Under Way"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Rome -- Lamberto Dini will be the new budget 
minister, so as of now the race to succeed him as director 
general of the Bank of Italy is officially under way. 
  There are two scenarios that are most likely. The first is a 
freeze on the post and a transfer of the functions to one of the 
deputy directors, the "old boy" Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, or the 
new arrival, Vincenzo Desario. This would involve asking the 
Bank's high council, the body that decides in such matters, for 
a sort of leave. This already happened once in 1919 with 
Bonaldo Stringher, who was appointed to the Treasury Ministry. 
Nevertheless, there are those at the Bank who point to the 
anomaly of this kind of choice, because the governor, holding a 
dialogue with Minister Dini, would have to make do with one of 
his subordinates, even if he is "in the freezer." 
  The second scenario, which is considered more likely, has it 
that the appointment of the new director general will come from 
outside, as, in fact, happened with Dini himself, who was called 
to Rome by the International Monetary Fund, where he served as 
director for Italy. Thus, by analogy, there are those who feel 
that Massimo Russo, the IMF official for Europe, will be put 
forward as a candidate. However, the name of Rainer Masera, the 
director general of IMI [Italian Institute for Financing 
Personal and Real Property], is also making the rounds, while 
two possible candidates -- Cesare Geronzi, director general of 
the Bank of Rome, and Mario Draghi, director general of the 
Treasury -- have let it be known that there is no question of 
them being involved. 
  Lastly, it is felt that an internal succession is highly 
unlikely, as this would mean advancing careers within the 
directorate by inserting a new functionary. Or, Padoa Schioppa 
could be promoted and some 10 new general officials would make 
their way into the control room. 
  Officially, the choice is up to the high council, which has 
to be convened by the governor. However, the budget minister 
has a certain amount of influence in the complex appointment 
procedure. To put it technically: There are 13 members on the 
council plus the governor. The deliberations begin with the 
favorable vote of two-thirds of those present, provided that 
two-thirds of the members are present. A date for the 
convocation has not yet been set, but there is no doubt that the 
councillors will be in Rome on 31 May for the Bank's meeting.

  [Text] Sinn Fein has sought further clarification of the 
Downing Street peace declaration. 
  In a move fuelling hopes of a breakthrough in the search for 
a political settlement in Ulster, the IRA's political wing has 
submitted a detailed list of questions to officials in Dublin, 
who will relay them to London. 
  Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds was on a short trip to 
the US today after again making clear his determination that the 
clarification logjam could not be allowed to continue. 
  In a Dublin speech last night, Northern Ireland Secretary 
Sir 
Patrick Mayhew made no reference to clarification, which Britain 
has consistently refused to deliver to Sinn Fein. 
  But earlier Deputy Irish Premier Dick Spring said no stone 
should be left unturned in the effort to explain the declaration 
signed by John Major and Mr Reynolds last December. 
  Mr. Reynolds is expected to refer to the peace process in a 
speech at Notre Dame University, Indiana, where he is to receive 
an honorary dedgree on Sunday [15 May]. He returns to Dublin the 
following day.

<F P=106> [By Chris Parkin and Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Text] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds was today 
briefing US President Bill Clinton on developments in the search 
for peace in Northern Ireland. The two leaders were meeting in 
Indianapolis, where Mr Clinton was unveiling a monument to 
assassination victims John Kennedy and Martin Luther King. 
  Mr Reynolds was expected to discuss with the President a 
list 
of questions drawn up by Sinn Fein, the political arm of the 
IRA, about the Downing Street peace declaration. Sinn Fein 
submitted the list to Mr Reynolds earlier this week and it was 
then in turn relayed to London. 
  Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew has said he 
will publish the list soon -- together with Britain's response. 
However, Ulster Unionists are suspicious of the Sinn Fein move, 
fearing it is another attempt at persuading Britain to clarify 
the declaration -- something John Major and Sir Patrick have 
consistently refused to do. 
  A Northern Ireland Office spokesman said Sir Patrick had not 
ruled out answering specific questions about the declaration, 
but still insisted it was not up for negotiation. 
  Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic 
Unionist Party, today warned that any answering of the questions 
by Britain would amount to clarification. He added: "Here once 
again we have a Government that lies and deceives, a Government 
that tells us one thing and does another. It is a Government 
that cannot be trusted. 
  "Rewarding gunmen and bombers is not a proper way for a 
Government, especially Her Majesty's Government, to be behaving." 
  Mr Robinson, MP for Belfast East, also criticised the Irish 
Government for acting as "postmen by appointment to the 
Provisional IRA". 
  Sinn Fein's questions are believed to centre on the precise 
way forward proposed by the Britain and Ireland if the IRA ends 
its campaign of violence. Mr Reynolds has made it clear he sees 
the Sinn Fein approach as offering new hope of success for the 
declaration he and Mr Major signed in Downing Street last 
December. 
  For his part, Mr Clinton, who requested today's talks, is 
anxious to be fully briefed on the latest Northern Ireland 
position ahead of an imminent visit to Britain. Mr Reynolds, 
who is due back in Dublin on Monday, is planning to deal with 
the Ulster issue in a speech in Indiana tomorrow when he is due 
to receive an an honourary degree from Notre Dame university. 
He said on his arrival in the US that Sinn Fein's questions 
should be dealt with "as soon as possible" to permit the peace 
process to move ahead.

  [Text] Vienna, May 14 KYODO -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) will send a five-member inspection team to 
North Korea on Sunday [15 May] to conduct a weeklong inspection 
of a radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon starting Tuesday, an 
IAEA spokesman said Saturday. 
  The IAEA needs the additional inspection now that North 
Korea 
has started preparatory works for exchanging spent fuel rods at 
its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers 
north of Pyongyang, the IAEA spokesman said. 
  North Korea notified the IAEA of the start of preparatory 
works in its letter on Friday, he said. 
  If North Korea commits a serious violation of the nuclear 
safeguards agreement, such as peeling seals off the fuel rod 
container, the team may suspend inspections, the spokesman said. 
  IAEA sources said the international nuclear watchdog could 
determine if North Korea has exchanged fuel rods by monitoring 
records from cameras and counters installed at the nuclear 
reactor. 
  The Yongbyon complex has been the focus of allegations that 
North Korea is pushing a clandestine nuclear weapons program. 
  In February, the United States and North Korea agreed to 
resume high-level talks on condition that Pyongyang allows full 
inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites. 
  But North Korea in March denied IAEA inspectors' access to 
the laboratory in Yongbyon, considered crucial in verifying 
whether fissionable radioactive material had been diverted to 
make nuclear bombs. 
  On March 1, the United Nations Security Council adopted a 
presidential statement calling on North Korea to allow full 
international inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  This time the IAEA inspectors will conduct necessary checks 
at the nuclear facility, including radiation measurement, the 
spokesman said. 
  The IAEA has repeatedly insisted that if North Korea goes 
ahead with the fuel rod exchange at the nuclear reactor without 
the supervision of IAEA inspectors, it would constitute a 
violation of the nuclear safeguards agreement. 
  South Korea's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY said in a dispatch from 
Seoul that North Korea told the IAEA it is regrettable that 
Pyongyang had to start changing fuel rods without IAEA 
inspections. 
  North Korea, however, made clear that there is room for 
negotiations, saying that there are a lot of opportunities as 
North Korea has just recently begun replacing the fuel rods, 
according to the YONHAP report. 
  The U.S. has also said that it would suspend a third round 
of high-level negotiations with North Korea if it changes the 
fuel rods without U.N. inspectors present. 
  North Korea said Thursday that the replacement of the 
uranium 
fuel rods in the Yongbyon reactor, which was started up in 1986 
and is almost exhausted, is a very urgent matter that cannot be 
deferred indefinitely. 
  The IAEA maintains that the sampling and analysis of the 
fuel 
rods would provide information on the North Korean nuclear 
program and any past activities in retrieving plutonium from 
spent nuclear fuel.

<F P=106> ["C.G."-signed report: "Kohl Holds Out Prospects of </F>
Cooperation Agreement With the European Union for Yeltsin"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 12 May -- Germany intends to help Russia 
become an equal member of European and international 
institutions. President Boris Yeltsin and Federal Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) agreed during 
their meeting in Bonn to bring about a cooperation agreement 
between the European Union (EU) and Russia under the German EU 
Presidency beginning early in July, which would help Russia in 
the economic area. Yeltsin announced that Russia would join the 
Partnership for Peace with NATO, if Russia's particularities 
were first considered in a protocol. Kohl and Yeltsin agreed to 
honor the withdrawal of the last Soviet troops from Germany on 
31 August with a ceremony in Berlin and not, as originally 
planned, in Weimar. Kohl and Yeltsin were in the Palatinate on 
12 May; earlier, Yeltsin met with Social Democratic Party [SPD] 
Chairman Rudolf Scharping in Bonn. 
  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party -- FDP) 
played tennis with his Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, on 
13 May and then made an excursion to Cologne. They also took 
part in a ceremony in Aachen, in which Norwegian Prime Minister 
Gro Harlem Brundtland was awarded the Charlemagne Peace Prize. 
Kinkel will hold talks with Yeltsin in Bonn this Friday [13 
May], he will then go to Stuttgart to conclude his visit. 
Kinkel and Kozyrev will jointly fly to Geneva to take part in 
the meeting of the contact group of several foreign ministers 
dealing with the war in Bosnia. Yeltsin, Kozyrev, Economics 
Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev 
had negotiated with Kohl and other German government members on 
11 May; Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (CDU) did not take part in 
these negotiations because he was in the island of Ruegen where 
he met with the Danish and Polish defense ministers. State 
Secretary Schoenbohm stood in for Ruehe in Bonn and held a 
separate discussion with Grachev on 12 May. 
  Yeltsin demanded "access to all European organizations" and 
to the international trade forum, GATT, for Russia. People 
should not forget that "we are a European country." Kohl 
promised he would work to allow Russia to take part in the world 
economic summit of the seven major industrial nations (G7) 
without any restrictions in the future. He said that this could 
not be expected for Naples in July where Russia would only take 
part in the political talks. However, the desire for Russia to 
cope with the transition problems made it necessary for the G7 
to allow Russia, in the foreseeable future, to take part in 
economic discussions: "Developments are tending to go in this 
direction." Yeltsin and Kohl described Russia and Germany as 
the most important mutual partners in Europe. 
  Kohl confirmed Germany's interest in Russia developing into 
a 
democratic, economically stable country: "Within the scope of 
our possibilities, we will support Russia in word and deed 
wherever Russia considers this desirable." According to the 
chancellor, this holds true for its inclusion in the work of the 
World Bank, the IMF, and the EU. "We are betting on and fully 
support President Yeltsin's reform effort." Russia's full 
membership in the EU "is not of current interest." First of all, 
we must energetically "pursue association." Yeltsin voiced the 
hope that within a month, agreement could be reached with 
Brussels on quotas and access to the market. Being a European 
country, Russia should also be a member of the Council of 
Europe, he said. 
  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) and his 
counterpart, 
Aleksandr Shokhin, agreed on an order worth 500 million German 
marks for the German railroad wagon company, Deutsche Waggonbau, 
in Halle this year. To guarantee this project financially, 
Germany will again grant special conditions. In 1995, smaller 
orders will follow. This cooperation is intended to lead to the 
joint development of Russian railroad wagon capacities. 
  The German and Russian government members said relations 
between the two countries were free from burdens and troubles. 
A commission of historians was instituted which will begin, at 
the end of June at the latest, to utilize the sources that have 
now become accessible for evaluation of recent history. By the 
middle of June, the next meeting of the German-Russian 
commission on the return of artistic items, which so far has 
been unsuccessful, will take place. Kohl insisted that the 
cultural agreement should form the legal basis for the return of 
such items. Now "concrete results" must be achieved: "Several 
problems have yet to be clarified." Yeltsin said that he and 
Kohl would agree on a schedule for further commission meetings 
before the end of this year. The negotiations on the opening of 
a consulate-general in Koenigsberg (Kaliningrad) have not made 
progress. 
  Yeltsin linked his wish for Russia's participation in the 
world economic summits with Moscow's cooperation within the 
Partnership for Peace and said that both were elements of "the 
all-round integration processes of Russia for the preservation 
of peace and security." Russia's "great role" must be taken 
into account, he said. In return, Russia supported Germany "as 
a worthy candidate" for a permanent seat on the UN Security 
Council. Because Germany was the second largest country in 
Europe after Russia, the close relations with Bonn were making 
it easier for Moscow to find a place in Europe's security 
system, said Yeltsin. "However, without a special protocol, we 
cannot sign the document on Partnership for Peace, with which we 
basically agree." Yeltsin said that what had to be considered 
as distinctive was the fact that Russia has an Army of 3 million 
men and equipment that is not in accordance with NATO standards. 
"Russia will start work with NATO in May to formulate the 
protocol." Yeltsin said: "Following the signing of the 
protocol -- and I do not think there will be any major problems 
-- Russia will also sign the Partnership for Peace document." 
  Yeltsin was satisfied that following the differences over 
the 
farewell ceremonies for the Russian troops, Kohl "has seen the 
mood of the people and their president." Referring to the 
military's annoyance with the original plan for a civilian 
ceremony in Weimar, Yeltsin said: "One cannot proceed in such a 
way that the situation in Russia is destabilized." "Therefore, 
the federal chancellor quickly agreed to hold the ceremony in 
Berlin, but without the allies." Kohl said it was his "wish to 
see off the soldiers in a dignified and respectful manner and in 
a friendly spirit." He added that he and Yeltsin would 
"personally deal" with the details of the "entire ceremony in 
Berlin, in order to meet our responsibilities." 
  Kohl indicated that he would like to see Russia bring its 
influence to bear on the Serbs, and said that both sides were in 
agreement that a solution for Bosnia was urgent. Yeltsin 
reiterated his suggestion of a "summit meeting" in Moscow of 
Russia, the United States, the Eu, and the parties involved in 
the Bosnian war: "However, at first we must be sure that the 
problem will be solved." That is why the meeting must be well 
prepared: "The foreign ministers have started work." He said 
that nationalism had also provoked wars in some CIS republics of 
the former Soviet Union: "We in Russia have shed no blood for 
such reasons." Yeltsin said he was not afraid of Zhirinovskiy 
and his nationalists: "No, no, we are not afraid of him; he has 
no substance." Yeltsin added: "Russia, which suffered in the 
war from 1941 to 1945, knows what nationalism means."

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "`We Were 
Allies'"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Pavel Sergeyevich, has the dispute 
on how to conduct your troops' withdrawal from Germany now been 
settled? 
  [Grachev] We have been waiting for a political decision by 
the Federal Government for a long time -- for me, this was the 
most important item on the agenda of our visit to Bonn. 
Chancellor Kohl himself said that our troops should withdraw in 
a festive and friendly atmosphere. This will happen, on 31 
August in Berlin. This decision is only just. It is a gesture 
of goodwill, which will hopefully be a symbol for future 
German-Russian relations. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The devil is in the nuts and bolts, and Berlin 
is quite big. Are you dreaming of a military tattoo at the 
Brandenburg Gate? 
  [Grachev] We will have to discuss all the details with the 
Berlin mayor and the Brandenburg minister-president now. We are 
thinking of a wreath-laying ceremony at the Treptow Park 
memorial. A special meeting in the Reichstag would be desirable 
-- although we will not insist on it -- and so would a public 
ceremony in Berlin's city. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Many Germans will not like this idea very 
much: They remember the Russians not only as liberators, but 
also as occupiers. 
  [Grachev] Of course, I can understand this. There are also 
many people in our country who remember the Germans as fascists 
-- people who wanted to overrun and destroy Russia. But the 
Germans also experienced the horrors of air raids, the 
destruction of their cities -- both by our troops and those of 
the allies. It is quite obvious that we are also considered as 
occupiers. But most people will know who is really to blame for 
all that. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you disappointed with your former allies 
-- the Americans, English, and French -- because they were 
opposed to a joint farewell ceremony with the Russians in the 
first place? 
  [Grachev] It is not true that we were dreaming of a joint 
farewell ceremony. I would not talk of a misunderstanding or 
even a provocation either. The agreement on our withdrawal by 31 
August was signed much earlier. 
  But, as to the allies' event in Berlin in September: We were 
allies in 1945 when we met at the Elbe River. It would, 
therefore, only be logical for the other three allies to invite 
Russian military representatives and politicians to participate 
in their ceremony. We would react positively to such a decision. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You threatened that the withdrawal of your 
troops from the Baltic states might be delayed because there are 
not enough apartments available for your soldiers returning to 
Russia. The Germans do not have to fear anything of that sort, 
do they? 
  [Grachev] Housing for the returning troops continues to be 
the biggest problem for us. But I am very grateful to the 
Germans. They have kept their financial promises: 7.8 billion 
German marks [DM] and another DM550 million for the construction 
of officers' apartments. But in my talks with State Secretary 
Schoenbohm of the Defense Ministry I presented claims against 
several construction companies, including four German ones: 
They are up to nine months in arrears with housing construction 
in Russia. Of course, this also goes for South Korean and 
Indian construction companies. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What made you change your plans and make a 
surprise visit to the Western Group of Russian Forces at 
Wuensdorf during your visit to Bonn? 
  [Grachev] Time is running out. Detailed discussions must be 
held with Supreme Commander Burlakov and all the other parties 
concerned on the last phase of the troop withdrawal. I have to 
present a detailed schedule to President Yeltsin on 16 May, who 
will then pass it to Chancellor Kohl to endorse. If our 
proposals are accepted, there will be no more obstacles to a 
complete withdrawal of the last Russian troops.

  [Text] Copenhagen, May 13 (AFP) -- Danish Interior and 
Immigration Minister Birte Weiss said Friday [13 May] she asked 
Albania, Hungary and Slovenia for authorisation to set up 
Danish-run camps for refugees from former Yugoslavia on their 
territories. 
  In a note to parliament, Weiss said there was no agreement 
so 
far to the requests, made in April, but that the government was 
continuing to seek an accord with the three countries. 
  Denmark runs a refugee camp in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
another 
in Croatia but the Croatian authorities last month refused to 
allow Denmark to set up another one there. 
  Denmark has also offered shelter for some 18,000 refugees 
from ex-Yugoslavia but believes haven should be provided as 
close as possible to home to facilitate return and to cut 
government spending.

  [Text] According to Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn, 
membership in the European Union [EU] does not change Finland's 
security policy toward neighboring countries. Speaking in 
Vienna, Austria, Rehn gave assurances that cross-border 
countries will continue to hold an important position in 
bilateral relations irrespective of the EU. She addressed a 
meeting of the second government party, the People's Party. 
Defense Minister Rehn pointed out the end of the Cold War had 
not changed the situation in northern Europe. For Russia, the 
strategic importance of its northwestern corner had only grown 
following the breakup of the Soviet Union and nuclear 
disarmament. Rehn reiterated Finland's stance that a country 
could retain an independent defense and military nonalliance 
within the EU.

  [Text] Newly appointed Foreign Minister Antonio Martino 
will meet his colleagues of the European Union [EU] in Brussels 
tomorrow. This will be his first public engagement. Today he 
summoned the Italian ambassadors in Europe to a meeting in the 
Belgian capital. Francesco Mattioli reports: 
  [Begin Mattioli recording] Is there an Italian problem for 
our European partners? 
  [Martino] I would not call it an Italian problem. However, 
there is no doubt that we must immediately tell our European 
partners -- and also the U.S. -- that our foreign policy will 
not change much. [end recording] 
  [Mattioli] Antonio Martino -- as his first public engagement 
as the newly-appointed foreign minister -- has decided to take 
this message to Brussels. He will meet Jacques Delors and the 
EU foreign ministers tomorrow. This afternoon he met the 
Italian ambassadors based in countries of the European Union. 
The problem of the Italian eastern borders does not exist, 
Martino said. It is not on the agenda. However, at a time of 
important changes, there is a need to explain the changes to the 
European family. 
  [Begin Martion recording] The governments of the various 
European countries always exchange information about domestic 
politics and on foreign policy strategies. Of course such a 
need is even greater now that the Italian political scene is 
changing so much. This is why I decided to rush here without 
even waiting for the confidence vote. 
  [Mattioli] So you want to reassure that there will be no 
changes, in spite of statements made by some people? 
  [Martino] Absolutely. Of course I am absolutely not saying 
that nothing will change. What I am saying is that the main 
points of the Italian foreign policy will remain the same as in 
the past. [end recording]

  [Text] The Serbian forces in Bosnia are escalating their 
attacks against the Muslim enclave of (Bihac) in western Bosnia 
while an interministerial conference is being held in Geneva 
aimed at ending the hostilities through political means. 
Participating in the conference are the foreign ministers of 
the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany, Greece, and 
Belgium as well as the international community mediators in the 
Bosnian issue. Their goal is to persuade the belligerent sides 
in Bosnia to return to the negotiating table. Greece is 
represented by Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias in his 
capacity as president of the European Union Foreign Ministers 
Council. 
  An ATHENS NEWS AGENCY dispatch from Geneva notes that the 
talks will open without any particular hopes and with the strong 
impression that there are substantive differences between the 
United States and France on charting a joint policy to impose a 
solution on the belligerent parties in Bosnia. The dispatch 
also stresses the difficulties that French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe had two days ago in persuading the U.S. leaders in 
Washington to exercise effective pressure on the Muslims in 
Bosnia. 
  It should be stressed that the U.S. Senate decided last 
night 
on the unilateral lifting of the arms embargo on the Muslims in 
Bosnia that was imposed by the United Nations. Shortly before 
leaving for Geneva, Foreign Minister Papoulias responded to 
questions from correspondents. Among other things, Papoulias 
said: The troika supports the EU action plan. U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher has his own ideas. Unfortunately, I 
have been informed that the U.S. Senate decided to lift the arms 
embargo on the Muslims in Bosnia. I think this decision could 
complicate the situation.

  [Text] Athens, May 14 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav President Zoran 
Lilic and Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou agreed on 
Saturday [14 May] that the ministerial meeting on Bosnia held in 
Geneva on Friday was major step in the direction of a political 
settlement of the crisis in former Yugoslavia. 
  The officials stressed as the most important that the whole 
negotiating process had been brought back to the framework of 
the European Union and its plan for Bosnia. 
  President Lilic is on a one-day visit to Athens en route 
from 
South Africa where he attended the ceremony of inauguration of 
President Nelson Mandela. 
  The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, Great 
Britain, France and the European Union's "troika" (Belgium, 
Greece, Germany), meeting in Geneva on Friday, invited Bosnia's 
warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats to agree to a four-month 
ceasefire, "with provision of extension," in which to open talks 
on a settlement of their disputes under the guidance of the 
recently formed contact group. 
  The ministers coordinated a common strategy in the efforts 
for solving the Bosnian conflict, and approved the European 
Union's formula for Bosnia under which that war-wracked former 
Yugoslav republic should be divided in such a way as to give the 
Moslems and Croats 51 percent of the territory in which to form 
their federation, and the Serbs the remaining 49 percent. 
  Lilic and Papandreou stressed the need for an equal 
treatment 
of all sides to the conflict in order that a just final solution 
might be reached, and agreed on the necessity of abandoning the 
practice of pressure, ultimatums, intervention and imposition of 
patent solutions. 
  They hoped that the resumption of Geneva talks would be 
dominated by reason on all sides in order that a peace [word 
indistinct] might be signed and the crisis resolved. 
  The talk brought to light the view that the lifting of the 
UN 
Security Council's sanctions against Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro), which were voted in place in May 1992 in 
retaliation for the country's alleged involvement in civil war 
in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, is a precondition for a 
peaceful settlement of the overall crisis in former Yugoslavia. 
  Lilic expressed his dissatisfaction that the Geneva 
ministerial meeting had not taken the position that the 
sanctions should be lifted, but added that the reference to 
their phased easing was nonetheless a positive step and an 
improvement on the earlier attitude and threats of intensifying 
pressure on Yugoslavia. 
  Lilic thanked Greece for its principled and firm position on 
the crisis in former Yugoslavia, particularly the problem of the 
sanctions. 
  He expressed fear that Turkish and U.S. military influences 
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and [word 
indistinct] might be a threat to the Balkan's and to Europe as a 
whole.

  [Text] Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos has 
proposed a "solution at all costs" on the Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue and has made it 
clear that he prefers an agreement on all points except that of 
the name, which will continue to be pending. 
  Moreover, he has implied that in the end it will be very 
difficult to avoid the term "Macedonia" in the name of Skopje. 
  Speaking to Sky's [private radio and TV station] program 
"Knock Out" the other day, Mr. Pangalos defended his phrase 
"lost case" on the Skopje issue. He explained: "I say that our 
attempt to win on the name issue is a lost case, but since we 
cannot accept a compromise at this time the issue should stay as 
it is." 
  Theodhoros Pangalos even insisted on his phrase that Skopje 
"has claims" on the term Macedonia, explaining that: 
  --It was called this from 1950 until 1990, when it was a 
Federal Republic. "We were recognizing it and Yugoslavia, which 
included it, and was a most friendly country." 
  --They live in a part, the smallest part, of historic 
Macedonia. 
  --The previous [Greek] government recognized a name that 
included the term "Macedonia." 
  "Unfortunately, what Mr. Konstandinos Mitsotakis has done 
continues to be Greek policy and whatever the current government 
does is Greek policy... [ellipses as published] So, we have 
recognized at the United Nations that they are called The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia which, if I am not mistaken, 
includes the word Macedonia, unless I no longer understand 
anything. We should keep all this in mind if we are to live in 
the world of logic..." [ellipsis as published] 
  According to diplomatic sources, the meeting between Foreign 
Ministry Secretary General Khristos Zakharakis and Cyrus Vance 
[UN mediator in Greek-FYROM dispute] will be held tomorrow, or 
most probably on Monday [16 May]. 
  The same sources noted that the negotiating process is now 
idle and that there is not any specific convergence of views. 
  At any rate, the Greek side goes to this round of 
negotiations with two principles: 
  --The Greek countermeasures remain as they are. 
  --All issues are open for discussion.

  [Text] The Vance-Zakharakis meeting was held in New York 
with President Clinton's special envoy Matthew Nimetz. The 
talks will resume shortly. No statement on these talks has been 
made but Mr. Nimetz's presence confirms the U.S. interest in 
resolving the problem and the existing movement around it. 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent in New York recording] 
Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry secretary 
general, held a substantive meeting for many hours here in New 
York with Cyrus Vance, UN special mediator in the Skopje [the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue. The 
meeting, which will continue in the afternoon, was also attended 
by Matthew Nimetz, President Clinton's special envoy on the 
issue. [end recording] 
  Mr. Zakharakis conveyed the Greek Government's positions on 
this phase of the negotiating process to Mr. Vance. In 
accordance with his practice, the UN secretary general's special 
mediator refrained from saying anything on the progress of the 
talks until, as he made it clear, he meets tomorrow with a 
Skopje representative. The round of talks will continue next 
week. 
  Diplomatic circles say these talks will determine the 
future, 
although it is still early to assess whether there is any chance 
to break the current stalemate. However, according to 
indications thus far, it should be expected that both the Greek 
and Skopjean sides will present a position that will allow some 
rapprochement toward a compromise formula that would allow the 
resumption of the dialogue. 
  Mr. Matthew Nimetz, President Clinton's special envoy and 
formerly a close associate of Mr. Vance, described the meeting 
as constructive and emphasized the U.S. Government's interest in 
finding a solution to the problem.

  [Text] After hearing of Albanian President Sali Berisha's 
statement yesterday on his willingness to visit Athens to defuse 
the recent crisis, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias described 
this change in stance as a positive gesture. 
  Mr. Papoulias added: The meeting between the two sides must 
be prepared properly and we should proceed with practical 
measures, primarily with those that are open and concern the 
Greek minority.

<F P=106> [Commentary by K.I. Angelopoulos: "Mr. Berisha's `A La </F>
Turks' Policy"] 
  [Text] The behavior of Albanian leaders toward Athens and 
the policy that they use against the Greek minority and the 
Orthodox Church in Albania have caused big problems. Everything 
shows that Sali Berisha's (formally democratic) regime follows a 
specific line. 
  It tries to prove in our Balkan region and internationally 
that Greece has territorial designs on Albania, the Orthodox 
Church there is a "political agent" of the Greek Government, and 
our country is a threat to the Balkans because of its relations 
with Belgrade. 
  The government has so far shown restraint on this issue, 
which passed through a phase of strong tension after the 
well-known fatal incident at Peshkepi, and it exhausted every 
diplomatic possibility to prevent deterioration of 
Greek-Albanian relations. However, Tirana's "response" to this 
cool behavior has shown that the Albanian regime seeks the 
deterioration of bilateral relations. 
  Apparently believing that he has secured some international 
"protection" and that his relations with Ankara will yield some 
profits for him, the Albanian president is attempting to 
formulate a "scenario" that would offer him the possibility of 
eliminating the Greek Orthodox minority from his country so that 
North Epirus would soon be inhabited by Albanian Muslims. 
  With such Albanian intentions, it is not surprising that the 
Zurich meeting on 3 May between the two countries' foreign 
ministers did not achieve any substantive results. Will there 
be positive results from another ministerial meeting as Tirana 
now wants? This could happen only if Sali Berisha and those who 
support his "line" decide to change their policy toward Greece 
and the Greek minority. However, this does not seem possible. 
The most probable thing that will happen is that Tirana will 
adopt Ankara's methods: Escalation of provocations along with 
invitations for "dialogue" at times to preserve the 
international community's impression of "good intentions." 
Given the current Tirana policy, Athens is obliged to consider 
a specific "Albanian policy."

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] The recently concluded congress of the 
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and other party 
developments were the subject of commentary in the Greek press. 
<H5>  Tsokhatzopoulos Loses Vote </H5>
  Writing in the 19 April Athens daily I KATHIMERINI, Stavros 
Liyeros discussed one of the main arguments that arose during 
the congress: the refusal of congress participants to approve 
the double role of Akis Tsokhatzopoulos as both party secretary 
general and minister of interior. Liyeros recalled the 1990 
congress, at which PASOK leader Andreas Papandreou threatened to 
dissolve the party if Tsokhatzopoulos were not appointed 
secretary general. While party regulations forbid the secretary 
to occupy a ministerial post, Papandreou nevertheless appointed 
Tsokhatzopoulos as minister of interior last October, remanding 
a solution of the dilemma to the 1994 congress. As the date of 
the congress approached, Liyeros continued, Tsokhatzopoulos 
attempted to reinforce his position in the party as Papandreou's 
"natural heir." To avoid a conflict the position of minister of 
state was offered Tsokhatzopoulos, who rejected it "out of 
hand." Tsokhatzopoulos believed the majority of congress 
participants would approve his dual position, since they had 
been elected "under his banner." Events proved him wrong, with 
two out of three participants voting against approval. Liyeros 
cited a PASOK official as saying that "we all wanted to send a 
message that we will not accept a second hegemony, especially a 
misprint of Andreas'." The party, Liyeros observed, has entered 
a "slippery course," because the "Tsokhatzopoulos group," which 
had extended its power in the central committee and the party 
apparatus, suffered a political defeat despite Papandreou's 
advice to his minister of interior to show "flexibility." 
Liyeros quoted a Papandreou aide as saying that "the prime 
minister had no reason to jeopardize his relations with PASOK 
and lose his role as almighty referee just to get 
Tsokhatzopoulos out of trouble." 
<H5>  Other Congress Developments </H5>
  Beyond the Tsokhatzopoulos issue, Nikos Kiaos took a 
critical 
look at other congress developments in the 21 April Athens daily 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA. 
  -- Papandreou was only present for an hour, the time it took 
him to open the proceedings, close them, and cast his ballot. 
He was crowned party leader once again by means of general 
applause and slogans which "covered up" the strong objections 
and criticism of the leadership a number of participants 
launched. 
  -- While the congress rejected open membership in party 
organizations, it approved without discussion the list of 
candidates for the central committee "imposed" by Papandreou and 
the party's executive bureau. 
  -- The congress boasted about "party unity," but all its 
members were engaged in conflicts related to the list of 
candidates for the central committee. 
  -- Papandreou repeatedly emphasized the "rebirth" of PASOK 
without specifying the means to achieve it. Such a "rebirth" 
was contradicted by the proceedings. 
  -- While all the members of the executive bureau disagreed 
with Tsokhatzopoulos' dual position, supporters of officials 
such as Kostas Laliotis and Yerasimos Arsenis voted for it. 
  -- Despite the fact that party groups and apparatuses were 
denounced, the central committee is dominated by the 
Tsokhatzopoulos, Simitis, and Arsenis groups. 
  -- Although a congress is expected to generate discussion of 
"hot problems," foreign and domestic policy issues were barely 
mentioned and only self-satisfaction was expressed. 
  -- Finally, no discussion of the past 2O years or criticism 
of erroneous policies occurred, Kiaos observed.

<F P=106> [Serdar Turgut report: "$1.5 Billion From the United </F>
States"] 
  [Text] Washington--The U.S. Administration has agreed to 
transfer the $1.5 billion which has accumulated in the Gulf Fund 
to Turkey, on the condition that Ankara sign a stand-by 
agreement with the IMF. It has been learned that U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has "agreed" in principle to Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller's request for the transfer of that fund to 
Turkey. It has also been discovered that Bentsen's only 
condition was the IMF's approval. 
  The United States does not want the fund to be used for 
political purposes. That is to say, it does not want it to be 
used to increase the wages of workers and employees. Nor does 
the United States want it to be used to meet agricultural needs. 
In light of that, Bentsen has received President Clinton's 
consent and is now waiting for Turkey to conclude a stand-by 
agreement with the IMF. When that agreement is signed, the 
Turkish Government will not be able to use that fund in any way 
it wishes. The U.S. Administration has decided to wait for that 
guarantee. 
  The Gulf Fund can only be used for the realization of 
Turkey's F-16 project. However, circles close to the U.S. 
Administration have said that the United States will ignore any 
move by Turkey to use that fund for short-term measures aimed at 
reactivating the economy, provided that the IMF agrees. 
Meanwhile, it has been ascertained that the Pentagon has 
withdrawn its reservation on the transfer of that fund in 
accordance with the guarantee Turkey has given that it will be 
used in the long run for its original purpose. 
  Meanwhile, during the Turkish officials' talks with the IMF 
and the World Bank to prepare for the requirements after the 
stand-by agreement is reached it became apparent that Turkey may 
quickly relax on the economic front when that agreement is 
signed. The IMF and the World Bank have decided to extend a 
$300 million credit to Turkey for privatization projects. 
Furthermore, Japan will also extend a credit of $300 million to 
Turkey. That was decided in the talks the IMF and World Bank 
officials had with the Japanese Government. Japan's credit will 
be available immediately after the IMF and the World Bank extend 
their credit to Turkey. That means that Turkey will receive a 
total credit of $600 million. 
  Turkey will receive $1.5 billion dollars from the U.S. 
Administration and $600 million from the IMF, the World Bank, 
and Japan after it concludes a stand-by agreement with the IMF. 
That development will ease the economic and financial situation 
in the country. However, the funds that will be transferred to 
Turkey will have to be used in accordance with the stand-by 
agreement's conditions. 
  Meanwhile, it has been observed in Washington that Ankara's 
willingness to conclude a stand-by agreement with the IMF is 
gradually removing the anxiety about Turkey. 
  Furthermore, the IMF Executive Council has approved the 
World 
Bank's decision to extend a $100 million credit to Turkey for 
the services of consultants in the realization of the master 
plan for privatization. The World Bank decided to extend that 
credit to Turkey some time ago; however, it has withheld it for 
the past two months. Meanwhile, Japan has donated $2 million to 
Ankara to be used for privatization projects.

  [Text] The Russian Federation has submitted a note to the 
Turkish Embassy in Moscow on the statutes and regulations of the 
straits that will go into effect on 1 July, saying that they are 
not in line with the Montreux Treaty and that the traffic 
regulations of the straits should be solved at the international 
level. 
  The response that was conveyed to the Russian Foreign 
Ministry today states that it is Turkey's most natural right to 
regulate the maritime traffic in the straits in a way that will 
ensure maritime safety and protect the environment. According 
to information released by the Foreign Ministry, the note, whose 
contents were made public by the Russian Federation's foreign 
affairs spokesman, states that Russia shares Turkey's concern 
regarding the maritime safety of the straits but that this issue 
should be solved at the international level. 
  The Foreign Ministry announcement adds that the reply 
message 
conveyed to the Russian Federation expresses the following views: 
  We welcome the fact that the Russian Federation shares our 
concern regarding traffic safety in the Turkish straits and that 
it accepts the fact of the existence of an urgent and serious 
problem that needs to be solved. We, however, do not agree with 
the views that the statutes and regulations are in contravention 
of the Montreux Treaty and that they may be implemented 
arbitrarily. We believe that these views constitute a biased 
approach to technical regulations which we have not even begun 
to implement. The reply message further recalls that for the 
past 58 years, Turkey has been meticulously implementing the 
Montreux Treaty, adding that concerns regarding this issue are 
invalid. The message adds that the Turkish Government has no 
intention of unilaterally changing the Montreux Treaty and that 
the changes in the statute are nothing more than the reflection 
of international rules and regulations on domestic law.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that Turkey, 
which is absolutely right about the Cyprus issue, is sometimes 
accused of being wrong and unfair about the issue as a result of 
propaganda and the effect of certain forces behind closed doors. 
The president stressed that it is not the Turkish side that has 
been creating difficulties for the past 20 years and preventing 
the achievement of a solution. 
  Demirel received Hakki Atun, prime minister of the Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC], today. Demirel said that 
the Cyprus question is the national cause of every single one of 
the 60 million citizens of Turkey. He pointed out that there 
has not been any bloodshed on the island during the past 20 
years, and that this is thanks to Turkey, not the United 
Nations. It is Turkey and its kinsmen in Cyprus that have 
suffered from the lack of solution, he said, adding that the 
Turkish Cypriots have been isolated and that their only window 
and door to the world is Turkey. 
  The president explained that the ethnic purge in Yugoslavia 
was seen in Cyprus years ago. Turkey is carrying out a just 
defense by protecting and saving the Turkish Cypriot community 
on the island, he stated, adding: Eventually, everyone will 
recognize the right to life of the Turkish Cypriot community. 
  [Begin Demirel recording] However, that will not be enough. 
It will be necessary to guarantee that right to life. It will 
be necessary to prevent a return to the old days. The times 
before 1974 when bloody incidents used to take place are a thing 
of the past now. When it talks of a political solution, Turkey 
wants to guarantee its kinsmen's security and the fact that 
there will not be a return to the old days. After that, it 
naturally seeks political equality. Turkey is so right, and our 
kinsmen in Cyprus and the TRNC are so right, that it is 
ridiculous to try to portray their stand as being wrong or 
unfair. [end recording] 
  President Demirel stressed that it is not Turkey and the 
Turkish Cypriots that have been creating difficulties for the 
solution of the Cyprus problem. The TRNC wants a reasonable, 
just, and viable solution more than anybody else, he said. 
  Demirel pointed out that it is of great importance that the 
Turkish Cypriot side become economically self-sufficient. The 
necessary potential for that exists, he said, and Turkey has 
always supported it. 
  The president stressed that Turkey is making great efforts 
to 
resolve the problem politically.

  [Text] Istanbul (A.A) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has 
said that he is disturbed by the unfounded reports concerning 
the state that have been concocted by journalists. 
  Cetin who returned to Ankara after taking part in a private 
television station show in Istanbul, replied to reporters' 
questions at Istanbul Ataturk Airport. 
  Replying to a question on a news report that appeared in one 
of the dailies today under the headline "We Should Go to War," 
Cetin said that he made no such statement. He added: "I was 
shocked when I read the report: `The extension of Greece's 
territorial waters to 12 nautical miles is a reason for war. We 
should go to war with Greece.'" 
  Cetin stressed that when writing such reports, journalists 
should consider the possible consequences. He added: "Certain 
journalists sit at their desks and concoct news reports. This 
issue concerns the state. We will get into trouble because of 
such unfounded reports." 
  Commenting on the fact that Turkey and Russia sent each 
other 
notes in connection with the Montreux Treaty on the straits, 
Cetin said: "The efforts to reorganize the treaty are in line 
with international law. That is what we pointed out in the note 
we sent to the Russian Federation. The answer we receive to our 
note will shape the developments between the two states in 
connection with this matter."

<F P=106> [Report by Mary Brasler: "CBI Calls for `Balance' in </F>
Europe's Law"] 
  [Text] The Confederation of British Industry [CBI] today 
launches a fresh attack on the lack of competitiveness at the 
heart of the European Community and calls for further efforts to 
improve the efficiency of both the Single Market and European 
businesses through better, and, in some cases, less legislation. 
  In a paper entitled The Business Agenda for Europe in 1994, 
to coincide with the run-up to European elections next month, 
the CBI says there should be a moratorium on further social 
legislation and a more balanced approach to environmental 
regulations that recognises industry's need to be competitive 
internationally. 
  "It is vital that the governments of Europe listen to the 
business case. While business itself can do much to reverse the 
decline in competitiveness, it is the legislators who create the 
environment in which business operates," says Howard Davies, 
director general. 
  The CBI onslaught follows an equally critical paper from the 
Institute of Directors as its contribution to the Euro-election 
debate. The institute is pressing for changes in EC political 
institutions and says the European Commission should no longer 
occupy the central position. 
  Members are unhappy about the way the EC is operating and 
behaving but feel the EC should be given "one more chance" 
before withdrawal is considered. 
  The CBI wants more attention paid to competitiveness in 
future legislation, in order to reverse the trend of low growth 
and high unemployment in Europe. New legislation should include 
a cost benefit procedure which should also spur further 
deregulation, its paper argues. Other points of the agenda 
include accelerated plans to outlaw state subsidies and more 
work to complete the Single Market. 
  Social policy should be reshaped to remove restrictions that 
block employment. 
  The CBI is clearly divided, however, on what role a single 
currency should play in Europe. The agenda complains that the 
Maastricht timetable in unrealistic and calls for new proposals 
from the European Monetary Institute. There is deep concern 
among some businesses that a strengthened European parliament 
after next month's elections will have a considerable impact on 
legislation affecting business.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, political editor, PA News] </F>
  [Text] Bryan Gould, a former shadow cabinet minister, has 
officially resigned as an MP [Member of Parliament]. He is to 
return to his native New Zealand to take up an academic post. 
  This creates a by-election -- the sixth pending -- in 
Dagenham, in east London. He had already announced his 
intention to quit. 
  Mr. Gould, 55, a committed Euro-critic, fought John Smith 
for 
the leadership in 1992 as the torch-carrier of the left. But he 
was routed. 
  He resigned last night as an MP under the technicality of 
being appointed by the Chancellor as steward amd bailiff of the 
Manor of Northstead. This is an office of profit under the 
Crown and prevents its holder from serving as an MP. 
  The two offices of profit under the Crown which are 
alternatively used are the Chiltern Hundreds and the Manor of 
Northstead. Theoretically an MP cannot resign but can be 
disqualified by accepting such an office. 
  Holding them, however, generates no income, but a person's 
membership of the House automatically lapses. 
  General election result at Dagenham -- Bryan Gould (Labour) 
22,027; Don Rossiter (Conservative) 15,294; Charles Marquand 
(Liberal Democrat) 4,824. Majority 6,733. Turnout 70.7 
  The writ for the by-election may be moved today, along with 
others. It could take place on June 9, the same day as the 
European elections.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, political editor, PA News] </F>
  [Text] Ex-shadow cabinet minister Bryan Gould today warned 
Labour that it might rue the day if it continued with a "safety 
first" policy and allowed the Tories to get their act together 
before the general election. 
  Mr. Gould, who last night resigned as an MP, told the party 
that if people started to think more kindly of the Tories again 
then Labour's huge opinion poll lead would "fade away pretty 
quickly." 
  He was unsure if any of the likely contenders for the Labour 
leadership would try to put the party on the more radical and 
positive course that he would have wanted. 
  Mr Gould did not think it was a foregone conclusion that 
shadow home secretary Tony Blair would emerge the winner. 
  "He is the front runner, justifiably. He is seen as the most 
voter-friendly of all the candidates. 
  "But it is inevitable that as the contest is joined he will 
come more in the spotlight and that some of the doubts which 
inevitably must exist with all the candidates in different ways 
will arise in his case. 
  "He is young and inexperienced. My view is that he has the 
qualities to overcome these problems, if problems they are, 
pretty rapidly once he comes into office," Mr Gould told the BBC 
Radio 4's Today programme. 
  Mr Gould believed Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry 
secretary, was the most able of all the contenders. 
  "In the end, I fear that Robin might not quite make it 
because of a rather unfair perception that he is not 
`voter-friendly,'" Mr Gould added. 
  Meanwhile, Labour has accused the Liberal Democrats of 
breaking the campaigning truce which it was hoped the three main 
parties would observe until after John Smith's funeral on Friday. 
  The Liberal Democrats were holding a news conference today 
to 
launch their campaign for the Eastleigh by-election, to be held 
on June 9 -- the same date as the Euro-elections. 
  A spokesman for Labour said: "We are dismayed by this 
decision." But a spokeswoman for the Liberal Democrats said she 
did not think this breached any arrangement. Matthew Taylor, 
the party's election campaign coordinator, was speaking at the 
news conference in support of their candidate, David Chidgey.

<F P=106> [Report by defense correspondent Charles Miller] </F>
  [Text] The cost of buying Trident ballistic missiles from 
the United States is set to soar, MPs [Members of Parliament] 
warned today. They urged the Government to complete its 
purchase of missiles from U.S. manufacturer Lockheed "as soon as 
possible." 
  Costs could rise by as much as 80 million pounds sterling 
this year alone because of the increasing likelihood that the 
U.S. will substantially cut its order, pushing up the unit price 
of each missile. 
  The Commons defence committee warned: "We fear that future 
rises may far exceed present provision, and consider that MoD 
[Ministry of Defense] must be prepared to complete its missile 
procurement programme as soon as possible to avoid such cost 
penalties." 
  Britain has purchased 44 missiles to date, and the total is 
likely to be around 70. But the committee stressed the 
purchases should be completed in much less than the four to six 
years suggested by MoD. 
  In their report on the Trident programme, the MPs also 
disclosed that the production and assembly of nuclear warheads 
at the Atomic Weapons Establishment [AWE] at Aldermaston and 
Burghfield would virtually stop by the year 2000. This follows 
the cancellation last year of plans to replace the WE177 
free-fall bomb and the end of Trident warhead production. 
  The committee said a "large and costly" proportion of AWE 
facilities would be left idle and the two Berkshire sites would 
revert virtually to doing research work. The MPs agreed there 
was "no foreseeable need" for further British nuclear tests in 
the immediate future. And they urged the MoD to provide 
sufficient funds to ensure nuclear expertise and safety could be 
maintained without the need for testing.

  [Text] The upper chamber of the Canadian parliament, the 
Senate, has given its approval to a bill that will allow 
Canadian Coast Guard and other agencies to arrest pirate 
fishermen on the high seas. 
  The bill was introduced in the lower chamber, the House of 
Commons, just two days ago. It has already been given royal 
assent, which means it has now passed into law. 
  With passage of the new law Canada claims the right to stop 
and arrest vessels and crew suspected of fishing illegally 
outside Canada's 200-mile limit. The move by Ottawa is directed 
at vessels with no nationality or those that sail under flags of 
convenience. 
  Canada is trying to protect dwindling fish stocks off its 
east coast, which have cost thousands of Canadian jobs.

<F P=106> ["fy"-signed report: "Joint Military Exercises With Poland </F>
Agreed Upon"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 12 May -- The defense ministers of Poland, 
Germany, and Denmark have agreed that the three countries hold 
joint military exercises and thus meet Poland's wish to pave the 
way for the country's full membership within NATO as soon as 
possible. Poland not only intends to use the "Partnership for 
Peace" initiative to come closer to NATO. It also seeks to 
adjust its armed forces to the Alliance structures as fully as 
possible, and to hold joint military exercises with NATO member 
states. Through practical cooperation, the country is to be 
integrated into the planning of the Alliance's integrated 
military organization. German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
(Christian Democratic Union) and his Danish counterpart, Hans 
Haekkerup, back Poland's wishes. This became clear in the talks 
they held with their Polish counterpart, Piotr Kolodziejczyk, in 
Warnemuende on 12 May. How highly Ruehe assesses the importance 
of this meeting is shown by the fact that, on that day, he did 
not accompany Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who had 
come to Germany with President Boris Yeltsin. 
  In order to further Poland's wish to join NATO as soon as 
possible, the three defense ministers agreed to hold joint 
military exercises of the Polish, Danish, and German Armed 
Forces this year and in subsequent years. These maneuvers will 
initially be trilateral exercises in the responsibility of the 
nations concerned and will be coordinated with NATO. The first 
exercise will be a trinational naval exercise off the 
Mecklenburg coast in September. The next exercise, to be held in 
October, will be more important and will be held in Jutland by 
Polish, German, Dutch, and Danish engineer forces. It forms 
part of the NATO maneuver, "Chinese Eye." It is true that the 
Polish Army will only take part with one platoon of engineer 
troops (50 men), but what is decisive here is the status. Next 
year, a joint command post exercise will be held in Poland. 
Ruehe hopes that by 1996, the legal conditions will be created 
for the Polish Army to take part in a maneuver in Germany. 
  The talks showed that Poland would prefer the closest 
possible inclusion of Russia in the "Partnership for Peace" 
concept to any other form of cooperation between NATO and 
Russia. This holds also true for cooperation in the framework 
of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).

  [Text] Brussels, May 16 (AFP) -- French objections to 
Russian sales of cheap uranium held up a decision by European 
Union [EU] foreign ministers here Monday [16 May] to sign a new 
trade, cooperation and partnership accord with Russia. 
  But diplomats predicted that the agreement would be wrapped 
up in mid-June. 
  The Greek chairman of the EU council of ministers, Theodoros 
Pangalos, said it might be signed by EU leaders and Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin at an EU summit on the Greek island of 
Corfu on June 24 and 25. 
  The accord would give Russia better access to western 
European markets and open up the prospect of a Russia-EU free 
trade area after 1997 if Moscow implements market reforms. 
  It also recognises Russia as an economy in transition 
towards 
a free market, rather than state-controlled. This concession 
tranlates into better trade terms. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe blocked the agreement on 
the grounds that it would favour Russian exports of cut-rate 
uranium to the EU, where France has 60 percent of the market. 
  Juppe insisted that nuclear fuels should be excluded from 
the 
accord, at least until it had won more favourable terms from 
Moscow. He is due in Moscow later this week to discuss the issue. 
  But diplomats suggested that the French objection was 
tactical and temporary, aimed at placating the influential 
French nuclear industry. 
  EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said: "I'm delighted 
at the reception given by our proposals on nuclear and banking. 
The agreement is effectively resolved and I am confident it 
will be agreed in June." 
  The accord has been held up for more than a year by Moscow's 
insistence on incorporating nuclear fuels, and on restricting 
the operations of foreign banks in Russia. 
  In a gesture to France, the European Commission has proposed 
that the EU retain the right to curb surges of cheap imported 
Russian uranium. 
  The EU executive has also accepted Russian insistence that 
foreign banks should be allowed no more than 12 percent of the 
Russian banking system's capital -- at least until a review 
after five years. 
  An EU diplomat reported a general sentiment at Monday's 
meeting that Russia would not budge and that the deal was the 
best that could be got. 
  The EU ministers also gave their approval to the signature 
of 
a similar trade, cooperation and partnership agreement with 
Ukraine, which was initialled in March. 
  Diplomats said Ukrainian President Leonard Kravchuk might 
sign the accord with EU foreign ministers at a meeting in 
Luxembourg on June 14. 
  They said he had asked for the signing ceremony to be held 
ahead of a Ukrainian presidential election at the end of June.

  [Text] Brussels, May 16 (AFP) -- The European Union and 
Ukraine will sign a wide-ranging trade, cooperation and 
partnership agreement next month, an EU spokesman said during a 
meeting of EU foreign ministers here Monday [16 May]. 
  The meeting also gave general support for proposals that the 
EU and other western countries should help pay for new nuclear 
power stations in Ukraine so that the dangerous Chernobyl 
nuclear power plant can be closed down. 
  The spokesman said Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk was 
expected to sign the partnership accord at the next meeting of 
the EU's foreign affairs council in Luxembourg in mid-June. 
  The accord, initialled by the two sides in March, will give 
Ukraine greater access to western European markets for its 
exports, and a high-level political dialogue with Brussels. 
  It stipulates that Ukraine might be able to join a free 
trade 
area with the EU sometime after 1997 if it makes sufficient 
progress towards a free market. 
  The EU ministers agreed that the accord should be signed 
without delay, and not used as a lever to make sure that Kiev 
meets its commitments to get rid of all nuclear weapons 
inherited from the old Soviet Union. 
  The EU has acknowledged that Ukraine, a country roughly the 
size of France and formerly known as Russia's breadbasket, is in 
desperate need of help to prop up a sharply-declining economy 
and avoid social breakdown. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the partnership 
accord could still be used as pressure on Kiev to dismantle all 
the nuclear weapons, even after it was signed. 
  The European Commission outlined its proposal for helping 
finance the building of new nuclear power stations in Ukraine to 
replace the Chernobyl plant, where the world's worst civilian 
nuclear accident occurred in 1986. 
  The proposal is to be discussed at the G-7 summit of 
industrialised countries in Naples in July. 
  The Ukrainian authorities are still using two of Chernobyl's 
four nuclear units, on the grounds that Kiev is dependent on the 
plant for energy. They say they need three billion dollars to 
close it down and replace it. 
  The commission also won general support for a 100 million 
ECU 
(120 billion dollar) plan to send food to the Ukraine, so that 
it can be sold and the proceeds used to bolster the Ukrainian 
economy.

  [Text] Brussels, May 16 (AFP) -- A draft European Union 
plan to fight unemployment through investments and business 
deregulation ran into strong opposition from Britain and Germany 
here on Monday [16 May]. 
  European Commission president Jacques Delors urged foreign 
ministers to push the plan forward over the heads of finance 
ministers who were meeting separately and are balking at finding 
money for massive capital investments. 
  Delors also objected to a German proposal that all EU 
legislation be reviewed by a panel of independent experts with a 
view to identifying and scrapping laws which hinder business 
activity and the creation of new jobs. 
  Delors, the EU's chief executive, said he was in "total 
disagreement" with the proposal from German Economics Minister 
Guenther Rexrodt because it would give outsiders power over EU 
decision-making. 
  But British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, 
weighing in with the Germans, told journalists that Delors was 
the perfect illustration "of how a bureaucracy will not reform 
its own procedures." 
  Germany and Britain remain in the forefront of countries 
which insist that the EU rely largely on the private sector to 
finance a 120 billion ECU (135 billion dollar) investment plan 
launched by EU leaders last December. 
  They want to build an infrastructure of transportation, 
energy and telecommunication networks spanning Europe, in order 
to support business and put more people to work. 
  German Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Ursula Seiler- 
Albring said that Bonn would not accept that the EU raise more 
money to finance these projects in addition to the lending 
capacity of the EU's European Investment Bank. 
  Clarke agreed. "There are enormous amounts of private 
capital 
available across Europe," he said. 
  But Delors insisted that some proposed projects might not be 
attractive to private investors because they were too 
environmentally-demanding or too long-term. 
  The private sector was more interested in 10-year 
investments 
than projects which might take three decades to complete, he 
said. 
  Earlier this year the commission proposed that the EU raise 
a 
six-year loan of 48 billion ECU (54 billion dollar) to finance 
some of the projects, which include highways, highspeed railways 
and a trans-Alpine rail crossing. 
  In the face of general scepticism on the part of finance 
ministers, the EU executive has since dropped all public 
reference to the extent of financing needs. 
  But Delors warned that the growth plan, which is supposed to 
be the centrepiece of an EU summit next June, would make little 
progress unless the EU showed quickly that it was ready to back 
its projects with public loans. 
  Clarke said the EU was making little headway on the other 
major plank of the plan -- to lighten non-wage costs for 
European businessmen which include labour regulations and social 
charges to support welfare systems. 
  Supporting the German proposition for an independent study 
of 
EU law, the British chancellor said: "You cannot make progress 
on deregulation if you leave it to your own bureaucracy." 
  However, French Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery said he 
doubted the need for outside checks on the EU's work.

<F P=106> ["wff" report: "Commission Is Spreading Optimism"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, 12 May -- The Brussels Commission has 
worked out unusually positive forecasts for the economic 
development in the European Union (EU) for the discussions of 
the foreign, finance, and economics ministers who will meet in 
the Belgian capital next Monday [16 May]. For the first time in 
years, one is optimistic again, Danish EU Commission Vice 
President Henning Christophersen, who is responsible for 
economic policy, said. 
  A good upswing is just around the corner, Christophersen 
stated, pointing to his authority's forecasts, which are usually 
more pessimistic than those of other international 
organizations. Even if the predicted positive development does 
not continue, Brussels sees good prospects that a considerable 
number of member states will fulfill the most important 
criterion of the Maastricht Treaty for entering the final state 
of the Economic and Monetary Union in 1997- 98: current new 
state debts of no more than 3 percent of GNP. 
  The EU economic forecast now proceeds from an EU-wide real 
growth of 1.6 percent for this year and of 2.5 percent for 1995. 
The upswing is primarily supported by exports and by 
investments. Inflation continues to decline. Already in 1995 
-- and thus one year earlier than recommended -- it could be 2-3 
percent on average in the EU. Prospects on the labor market 
remain somber, however. According to Christophersen, the 
increase in the unemployment rate may come to a standstill 
during the first half of 1995, but it will remain at the high 
level of 11.75 percent.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 16 (CTK) -- Austrian President 
Thomas Klestil says in today's NARODNA OBRODA that Austria 
supports the efforts of Slovakia and other Central European 
states to join the European Union (EU). 
  In an interview prior to Slovak President Michal Kovac's 
visit to Austria today, Klestil says that for Central European 
states Austria can be the "Trojan horse (of integration), 
because if it joins the EU, the Slovaks, Czechs, Hungarians... 
will join it as well," Klestil is quoted by the paper as saying. 
Germany supported full Austrian membership in the final stage 
not because it would create a sort of German bloc, but because 
Germany realized that without Austria it was impossible to get 
other states involved in the integration process into the EU, 
Klestil says. 
  "It is absolutely clear that we will back our neighbors' 
efforts at EU membership," he says, pointing out that in the 
event of a positive result to Austria's referendum (on joining 
the EU) Slovakia will become a direct neighbor to the EU. 
  On economic cooperation, Klestil says that his country's 
investments in Slovakia are quite high and that the number of 
joint ventures is also quite big, which he describes as a 
positive development. "However, it is also true that sometimes 
Austrian firms complained about the slow pace of privatization 
and unresolved property and other issues," Klestil says. 
  Asked by the paper whether Austria could be a mediator in 
overcoming tension between Slovakia and Hungary, Klestil replies 
that this can happen only if both sides so request. In his 
opinion, it is better for Austria to meet the two countries' 
representatives and discuss issues informally. "And this is 
what we are doing," Klestil says.

<F P=106> [Report by Conrad Seidl: "`Austrians Want an EU Different </F>
From the One on Offer'"] 
  [Text] Transferring freight traffic from road to rail is 
the priority issue that Austrians want to see put into effect if 
Austria joins the European Union [EU]. This is demanded mainly 
by men and by the younger and better educated members of 
society. Direct subsidies to agriculture are far less important 
than other issues, such as crime prevention and the 
simplification of administrative procedures. 
  This emerges from the opinion poll conducted for DER 
STANDARD 
by the "Market" research institute. In the view of Market's 
chief, Werner Beutelmeyer, the findings indicate that the 
Austrians -- and particularly those in favor of joining the EU 
-- "basically want to have a different EU than the one on 
offer." At the same time, expectations are high: One in three 
Austrians demands that Austria send competent representatives to 
Brussels; one in five wants Austria to participate in the 
security alliance. 
  The concept of a security alliance is particularly 
attractive 
to the better educated and supporters of the Freedom Party of 
Austria [FPOe]. The demand for maintaining neutrality, which 
contradicts this view, continues to have a relative majority of 
35 percent. Neutrality finds particularly few supporters within 
the Austrian People's Party (25 percent) and the FPOe (28 
percent). 
  The idea of further (eastern) states joining the EU is not

the Social Democratic Party of Austria voters like the idea the 
least.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend by </F>
unidentified correspondent in Vienna; date not given: "`Europe 
Has Become Most Insecure'; Fasslabend Warns of Nonmembership"] 
  [Text] With or without entering the European Union [EU], 
Austria must "do more for its security in the future because 
large parts of Europe have become most insecure." This was said 
by Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend, of the Austrian People's 
Party [OeVP], in an interview with the APA. At the same time, 
Fasslabend pointed to the numerous advantages of EU membership 
in terms of security policy. The emergence of a European 
security system must not automatically imply the renunciation of 
neutrality, the minister said. 
  Nevertheless, the question arises of how to evaluate 
neutrality. Even now, neutrality "has undoubtedly no longer the 
function it used to have," the defense minister said. In the 
current situation, a few weeks before the EU referendum, it is 
better to avoid a discussion on the issue. 
  One should at a later stage deal with all security policy 
issues, including NATO's Partnership for Peace, following the 
example of Sweden and Finland. In this connection, Fasslabend 
pointed out that the Federal Government had already decided that 
EU accession should be combined with an observer status in the 
Western European Union, the EU military arm. 
<H5>  Outside Help </H5>
  This would offer Austria the possibility to "participate in 
the field of security policy and, in 1996, to have the 
opportunity for active participation in a future European 
security system," the defense minister said. 
  Fasslabend believes that the following advantages in terms 
of 
security policy would go hand in hand with EU membership: an 
"undoubtedly diminished likeliness of a direct attack against 
our country, the certainly quicker and more efficient help if 
such a direct attack should still take place;" the increased 
readiness to provide outside help for possible outside dangers, 
such as a threat through missiles; and, most importantly, the 
possibility of direct cooperation in crisis prevention, which 
could influence the emergence and spreading of developments as 
in Yugoslavia. 
  Fasslabend emphasized that EU accession would not be linked 
to the creation of a professional army. After all, most EU 
member states have compulsory military service, just like 
Austria.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Claes Appeals For Peace Force in </F>
Neighboring Countries"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In an interview given to BRTN 
[Dutch-language Belgian Radio and Television], Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes called for creating an African force to protect the 
hundreds of thousands of refugees in the areas bordering Burundi 
and Tanzania. He observes that the United Nations has not 
succeeded in resolving the conflict, and that Belgium and France 
are not regarded as neutral. According to Claes, the United 
States is in the best position to bring about a cease-fire. 
"Hence my idea of asking the United States to play a more 
active role. I am going to talk with George Moose, U.S. deputy 
secretary for African Affairs, and set the priority of achieving 
a truce," Claes said. 
  "The United Nations must not be depicted as an institution 
that can work miracles," Claes added. He also said Belgium may 
have been naive where Rwanda was concerned. "However, I prefer 
to be counted among the naive than among the murderers who keep 
on selling increasingly modern weapons," Claes concluded. 
  The main countries supplying arms to Rwanda are Uganda, 
South 
Africa, Egypt, and France.

<F P=106> [Piet van Seeters report: "Kigali Reminds Pronk of `Killing </F>
Fields'"] 
  [Excerpts] "What is now happening in Kigali is worse than 
anything I have ever seen. It is worse than the killing fields. 
It is slaughter that is comparable, in terms of the number of 
victims and the manner in which they are being murdered, with 
that which took place in Cambodia. It is different than and 
occurring on a larger scale than what I saw in Somalia, Sudan, 
and Bosnia." 
  This was the reaction of an indignant Development Aid 
Minister Pronk in Nairobi on Sunday [15 May] evening, following 
a short visit to the Rwandan capital of Kigali, where heavy 
fighting took place on Sunday. [passage omitted] According to 
Pronk, most of the murders are being committed by government 
troops. The rebels belonging to the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
(RPF) are also killing out of revenge, "but unlike the 
government militia they are not making themselves guilty of 
systematic, preplanned genocide," Pronk said. "After the attack 
on the presidents, the entire opposition was eradicated in a 
single night. And the carnage is still continuing." 
  In the meantime, 400,000 Rwandans have fled to other 
countries. According to Pronk, in the country itself between 1.5 
and 2 million people have fled for their lives. 
  Of this total number of refugees, 1.2 million are located in 
the south. "That is the least fertile part of the country, and 
it is the area that has suffered the greatest drought. The 
government troops are in charge there. It is becoming a major 
disaster. In the north, the situation is quieter. Aid 
organizations have already been able to achieve a great deal 
there and are negotiating with the RPF," Pronk continued. 
  Pronk emphasized that a maximum amount of aid must be 
provided as soon as possible: "An airlift must be organized 
because a great deal of food has to be shipped to Rwanda. And 
hopefully the United Nations will be able to send a force of 
5,500 men there. Everyone from the United Nations here says 
that it is the minimum. I hope that the United States takes the 
initiative to organize the airlift, for it is U.S. troops who 
have the greatest capacity to do so. [passage omitted] 
  Apart from the airlift, a cease-fire must be achieved in the 
near future. "However, the RPF no longer wants to talk with the 
government, but rather with the military. Yet they only want to 
talk if the government is present. So an impasse has been 
created. And I fear that the murdering will go on, because 
nobody has any hold on the militia," Pronk concluded.

<F P=106> [Report by Philip Johnson and Colin Randall: "Mayhew Warned </F>
of Trap in Ulster"] 
  [Text] Belfast -- Ulster Unionists warned the Government 
yesterday against being drawn into talks with Sinn Fein about 
the Downing Street declaration on the future of the province 
after ministers agreed to answer questions seeking to 
"clarifying" the document. 
  Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, is 
considering a response to questions put by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn 
Fein president, and channelled to London through Dublin. 
  He will publish his answers this week, but is expected to 
regard many of the points as matters for negotiation once the 
IRA gives up violence. 
  Official sources made clear that the reply would be 
determined by an assessment of whether the list amounts to a 
genuine attempt to clear up misunderstandings or ambiguity. 
  The move has rekindled hardline Unionist suspicions that the 
Government is prepared to engage in dialogue with the 
republicans before they have agreed to a permanent end to 
violence. The Government denies this. 
  Since the declaration was signed five months ago the 
Government has refused repeated Sinn Fein requests for formal 
clarification though some ministerial speeches have been 
interpreted as attempts to address republican concerns. 
  Anger among some Unionists that the Government should even 
contemplate answering Sinn Fein's points will have added to Sir 
Patrick's determination to give no impression of succumbing to 
republican demands for detailed amplification of the 
declaration. He will argue that some of the issues raised have 
already been amply dealt with in ministers speeches and 
statements. 
  Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist 
Party, said: "Once again we have a Government that lies and 
deceives, a Government that tells us one thing and does another." 
  More moderate Unionists were prepared to back the 
Government's willingness to respond to the questions, provided 
the answers made clear that there would be no further 
accommodation of Sinn Fein without a permanent cessation of 
violence. 
  Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionists, said 
that 
while the IRA was merely engaging in a further ploy with no real 
intention of ending terrorism, it was "a good thing that their 
bluff will be called and all will be revealed." 
  Mr Ken Maginnis, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said: 
"The Government should indicate to Sinn Fein one overriding 
pre-condition -- an unconditional end to violence." 
  But with progress on the declaration held up and the 
separate 
political process suspended until after the European elections, 
some Unionists fear that frustration at the lack of progress 
will bring overtures to Sinn Fein from London and Dublin. 
  Mr John Taylor, MP for Strangford, accused the Government of 
"playing the tune" of the IRA and said the province had lost 
confidence in Sir Patrick. 
  The Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, told Irish 
radio from America where he briefed President Clinton at the 
weekend: "There is a price to be paid for peace and all parties 
to the conflict in Northern Ireland should see it that way and 
make their contribution towards removing all the blocks." 
  Mr Adams told a meeting in Dublin that he wanted an end to 
the clarification debate "so we can all move the peace process 
on to the next stage."

<F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Excerpts] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds today 
repeated hopes that Britain would respond "sooner rather than 
later" to Sinn Fein requests for clarification of the Downing 
Street peace declaration. 
  Mr Reynolds, who last week relayed to London a list of 
questions from the IRA's political arm, briefed United States 
President Bill Clinton on developments before returning from his 
short trip to America today. After arriving at Dublin airport 
he said all sides in the Northern Ireland conflict should now 
take the opportunity to end the obstruction towards peace caused 
by the long-running clarification dispute. He repeated his 
opposition to any renegotiation of the five-month-old peace 
document he and John Major signed but said if there were genuine 
issues of clarification it was for the British Government to 
deal with the matter. There was now an opportunity for everyone 
to put the issue of clarification behind them and he said he 
believed the requests were "answerable" by Britain. 
  Downing Street said later the Government would consult with 
Dublin on the terms of its response to Sinn Fein's document of 
questions but a spokesman insisted the Government's views on not 
clarifying the declaration had not changed -- and there would be 
no negotiations on it. 
  "What the people of Northern Ireland want from Sinn Fein and 
the IRA is an immediate and permanent end to violence, not 
months of procrastination while violence continues," the 
spokesman said. 
  But Mr Reynolds, who had two meetings with President Clinton 
in Indianapolis on Saturday, said it was important to get back 
on the road to talks and bring an end to violence. 
  Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams today demanded "honest, 
unambiguous and forthright" answers to the questions and said 
Sinn Fein had taken a number of initiatives to remove the 
clarification obstacle. 
  He said the British Government "needs to adopt an equally 
positive attitude", adding: "Mr Major must move to close the gap 
of distrust between us. Therefore London should respond 
positively and in an unambiguous way to the questions we have 
transmitted to them through the Dublin Government. "Our specific 
questions should be answered in a direct and comprehensive 
manner. It is vital that London's response is honest and 
forthright." 
  But Ulster Unionists today warned the Government not to 
negotiate in public with the IRA. The party's security 
spokesman Ken Maginnis said that would be a "dangerous road to 
go down" and that the IRA was not ready to give up violence. 
  "The IRA...is clearly not prepared to cease violence at this 
particular time, so any exercise is both futile and an 
indication to the IRA that the Government is weakening," he 
added. [passage omitted] 
  Mr Reynolds later told BBC's One O'Clock News: "There will 
be 
no negotiation of the Downing Street declaration. We have said 
that time and time again. 
  "But if there are genuine areas of clarification that are 
required then let the British Government deal with that matter."

  [Text] If nothing worthwhile comes out of this week's 
written question-and-answer exchange between Mr Gerry Adams and 
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sinn Fein 
will have gained a propaganda victory. There will be grounds 
for accusing the Dublin government of folly, if not mischief, in 
pressing Britain so hard to extend the written dialogue with the 
Republicans. 
  For now, Sir Patrick's explanation -- that merely answering 
questions does not represent the "clarification" which he and Mr 
Major ruled out when Sinn Fein first responded to the Downing 
Street Declaration -- seems narrowly tenable. The original 
demand for "clarification" seemed to mean negotiation in all but 
name -- an impression borne out by Mr Adams's refusal to say 
exactly what he wanted -- while the IRA continued to exert 
pressure by means of terrorism. 
  If Mr Adams is still merely playing for time, further 
disingenuous inquiries will no doubt be forthcoming from Sinn 
Fein, designed to inch the Government ever closer to the 
negotiating table. The form of some of Sinn Fein's current 
questions invites such suspicion. For instance, "What are the 
means and within what time does Britain expect to see agreement 
reached between all the Irish people?" is tantamount to 
demanding a timetable for a united Ireland. On this and other 
points, Mr Adams should be directed towards the relevant 
passages of the Declaration. The Government cannot prudently go 
further, in advance of a permanent IRA cease-fire. 
  There remains the possibility, however, that Britain's 
uncompromising tactics have started to bear fruit. Sinn Fein 
may at last realise that negotiation is unattainable without a 
cease-fire. Answers to his questions may enable Mr Adams, who is 
alleged to be among the Sinn Fein "peace party", to win over 
some of the more militant IRA cadres without losing face. If 
Sir Patrick is merely issuing prolix statements of the obvious, 
thereby assisting Mr Adams to get off the hook on which he has 
publicly impaled himself, the risk he is taking might yet prove 
worthwhile. 
  Dublin's position is less straight-forward. By adding its 
own voice to Mr Adams's request for answers from Sir Patrick, 
the Irish government has chosen to vouch for the good faith of 
this latest initiative. But the Irish government's agreement to 
use its influence with Britain in this way imposes a duty to 
apply equal pressure in the other direction. As we have said 
before, Dublin's principal responsibility now is to use its 
weight to educate and moderate Nationalist and Republican 
sentiment, in Ireland and elsewhere, while not upsetting, Ulster 
Unionist opinion. In the wake of Sir Patrick's replies, Dublin 
must move to assure Irish and world opinion that Britain will 
have done all it could reasonably be expected to do.

  [Text] Bonn, 15 May -- Defense Minister Ruehe (Christian 
Democratic Union--CDU) must reduce the number of his employees 
in the Defense Ministry from the present 5,500 to 3,300 in the 
long term, said a Defense Ministry spokesman during the weekend. 
Ruehe wants to eliminate these posts by means of transfers and 
early retirements. There should be no dismissals, said the 
spokesman. Even when Stoltenberg (CDU) was defense minister, 
ways of reducing the number of employees were considered. BILD 
AM SONNTAG has reported on these economization plans, referring 
to a confidential letter Ruehe sent to the Bundestag Defense 
Committee, announcing the personnel reduction. Ten 
subcommittees are to be abolished.

<F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the </F>
Graf-Stauffenberg barracks in Sigmaringen on 29 April] 
  [Text] I am pleased to take up the invitation to visit the 
Graf-Stauffenberg barracks. Its name reminds us of the good 
part of our tradition as soldiers. On 20 July this year, we 
will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the resistance and the 
failed attack against Hitler. Claus von Stauffenberg represents 
those values for which the Bundeswehr, together with our 
partners, stands in the Western defense alliance: freedom, law 
and human dignity, and peace! 
  The ability to defend ourselves is the basic precondition 
for 
protecting these values, which are anchored in our Basic Law. 
This protection is, however, the business of our entire people, 
not just of the Bundeswehr. It needs the understanding and 
support of society, just as the Bundeswehr is keeping and must 
keep itself open for the great questions that concern our 
society and our state. 
  Here, in this place, my thanks go to all our soldiers. An 
hour ago, I met with soldiers who participated in the UN mission 
in Somalia. I expressed my special thanks to them for their 
dedicated and exemplary work. I was also able to convey to them 
the great appreciation their work has met with among the people 
in Somalia, among our partners and friends, in the United 
Nations, and by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. 
  Our soldiers have made an outstanding contribution to our 
country's reputation in the world. In a society that is used to 
thinking more in terms of claims than of obligations, the 
service of peace, which our soldiers and our conscripts do, is 
something special. Compulsory military service ensures that our 
citizens and our armed forces are connected by a live link. And 
this must remain so! 
  We also owe it to our Bundeswehr that we were able to 
overcome the East-West conflict and German division. The 
Bundeswehr and the NVA [National People's Army], formerly 
hostile armies, have now become an army of unity. Yesterday's 
enemies are now fellow citizens and comrades. This has made an 
essential contribution to German unity. 
  Now, however, the Bundeswehr is facing new, difficult 
challenges. This entails a sometimes painful process of profound 
restructuring, which has not yet been concluded. For the 
individual soldier -- and also for his family! -- this means 
much uncertainty. Therefore, we need the highest possible 
degree of long-term planning security. Necessary savings and 
restructurings must not be implemented at the cost of the 
people. Therefore, we need calm, profound, and cool-headed 
planning. The Bundeswehr certainly needs modern training and 
up-to-date equipment for its new tasks. However, the most 
important thing must be the precise definition of its assignment 
-- everything else is derived from that. 
  In a rule-of-law democracy like the FRG, the Bundeswehr is 
subject to political leadership. It is the Federal Government 
that, in cooperation with the parliament, has to determine the 
assignment of the Bundeswehr. Let me draw up a brief balance 
sheet of our policy and explain our central tasks of the future. 
  Today, half a century after the end of World War II, Germany 
has achieved the basic goals of its foreign policy: 
  -- Our country is unified in peace and freedom. We live in 
peace and friendship with all our neighbors. 
  -- Germany is firmly rooted in the European Union [EU] and 
in 
NATO. These communities of values ensure our peace and 
prosperity. 
  -- Germany is a respected member of the community of 
peoples; 
our voice is heard in the world. 
  We owe this excellent balance sheet to a persistent and 
flexible policy. However, we cannot stop at what we have 
achieved; we must consolidate the result of our foreign policy 
every day anew. 
  In Europe, we are confronted with three fateful questions: 
  -- How can we consolidate peace? 
  -- How can we secure the prosperity of our peoples? 
  -- How can we hold our own in the global framework? 
  For Germany the answer is clear: Only in and together with 
the EU, only together with our partners in the Western alliance, 
can we master these challenges. This basic decision determines 
German foreign policy in a world that has become far more 
complicated, in Europe, which is gradually growing together 
despite all the problems. 
  What is happened today in East Europe, in Prague, Kiev, and 
Moscow, also has consequences for us. Therefore, it is in our 
very own interest to expand the Euro-Atlantic stability 
structures to the east. 
  In the multipolar world that has developed after the end of 
the East-West conflict, security must be understood as 
"expanded" in a threefold sense: 
  -- geographically expanded -- more remote events can also 
have an effect on our security in an increasingly interdependent 
world; 
  -- functionally expanded -- early recognition and prevention 
are becoming more important; and 
  -- conceptually expanded -- poverty, hunger, overpopulation, 
the neglect of human and minority rights, and environmental 
destruction are new threats to our security. 
  Our foreign policy is facing up to such great challenges. 
The following are our goals: 
  First: We want to bring the states in Central and East 
Europe close to the EU. 
  Germany is not to be the easternmost state in West Europe. 
Rather, our place is in the center of a politically and 
economically unifying Europe. 
  In dramatic negotiations, the EU has initiated its expansion 
by the Nordic states and Austria. I myself have advocated this 
with all my strength. However, Europe is only at the beginning 
of the second half of its political and economic unification. 
The most difficult part -- the expansion of the EU as an anchor 
of stability also for Central and East Europe -- is still ahead 
of us. We must open the door to the EU for our East and 
southeast European neighbors and for the Baltic states -- as 
fast as this is possible in economic terms and in terms of 
integration policy. 
  One goal of our EU presidency during the second half of 
1994 will be to bring about association agreements with 
prospects for membership also with Latvia, Lithuania, and 
Estonia. At the same time, the EU must strengthen its 
decisionmaking mechanisms in such a way that it also remains 
able to act if the number of members continues to grow. We have 
agreed with France to join our two consecutive presidencies in 
the EU into one common program that will primarily deal with 
ostpolitik. 
  Our support goes to all states in East Europe, also to the 
states of the former Soviet Union. German aid to these 
countries has, however, meanwhile reached the limit of what we 
can provide. Now the other Western partners are also called upon 
to act. What we are doing for stability in Central and East 
Europe as well as in the CIS states also fully benefits our own 
security. In this respect, this, too, is an enormous 
contribution to defense in the broadest sense of the word, since 
defense cannot be defined by the category of military 
expenditure alone anymore. 
  Recently, a report by the Canadian Government listed the per 
capita expenditures of the seven largest industrial nations, the 
G-7 states, for the Soviet Union and its successor states since 
1989. The result was the following: Germany $341, Canada $67, 
France $34, Italy $31, the United States $30, Japan $5, and 
Great Britain $1. I think these figures speak clearly! 
  Second: With [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, I have 
initiated the association of the Central European and Baltic 
states with the Western European Union [WEU]. It would be a 
contradiction if we brought our eastern neighbors closer to the 
EU in political and economic terms, but excluded them from the 
security dimension. Before thy join the EU, we want the 
Visegrad states and the Baltic states to have close security 
policy consultations with us and to be able to participate in 
humanitarian and peacekeeping WEU operations. 
  Third: The defense alliance of NATO and the transatlantic 
security alliance should remain the foundation of our security. 
  Peace has by no means become a matter of course for all 
time. 
In the future, too, we need NATO as the supporting pillar of 
the European security architecture. The central function of the 
alliance, the collective defense of its members, remains 
indispensable for us, in particular since we are a nonnuclear 
power in a world in which other powers possess nuclear weapons. 
  In addition, the alliance has expressly agreed to the 
development of the European security and defense identity on the 
basis of the WEU. In the future, too, the WEU can take over 
greater responsibility for humanitarian missions, peacekeeping 
measures, and crisis management in coordination with NATO. 
  After all, the alliance wants to consolidate stability in 
Central and East Europe. At the Brussels summit in January, 
NATO presented the offer of a partnership for peace to the young 
democracies in eastern Germany. Fourteen states have already 
accepted this offer. We also offer this partnership to Russia. 
Now it is Russia's turn to decide whether it will accept this 
offer. 
  After all, the Atlantic alliance wants to be ready for 
action 
to cope with international crises, if all other means fail. The 
example of Sarajevo shows: Diplomatic efforts for mediation 
make progress only if they are supported by military power. The 
vicious circle of violence and counterviolence cannot be broken 
with economic sanctions alone. 
  Germany has a considerable share in he international efforts 
to solve the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Almost every 
night, German cargo planes are flying humanitarian missions in 
Bosnia. We have taken in more than 400,000 refugees from this 
war in our country, far more than all other states together. 
  The rapprochement between Muslims and Croats, the demand for 
an acceptable territorial solution in Bosnia, the modus vivendi 
in the Croatian territories occupied by Serbs -- this concept 
was worked out by the EU on the basis of an initiative, which I 
started together with my French colleague Juppe. 
  In Sarajevo, the international community managed to bring 
about a cease-fire, and now this has finally also been achieved 
for Gorazde. Nevertheless: There is no alternative to 
continuing the international efforts for peace! Russia must sit 
at the same table in this. 
  Basically, I agree with the idea of holding a foreign 
ministers' meeting to settle this terrible conflict. Any 
serious attempt to put an end to the war by negotiations is 
supported by us without any reservations. Such a meeting should 
take place if there are at least some prospects for success. I 
agree on this with my Russian colleague Kozyrev, who visited me 
in Bonn yesterday. 
  Fourth: We want to strengthen the CSCE. 
  The CSCE stands for the concept of cooperative security. Its 
main task lies in the prevention of conflicts and the early 
recognition of political crises. 
  The point is to energetically expand the culture of 
nonviolence and understanding, which has been established in the 
CSCE, and to expand it also in terms of institutions. In the 
future, the CSCE should also politically include the mission of 
Russian troops in the areas of conflict in the CIS. In addition 
to the United Nations, the CSCE provides the international 
framework to call on Russia to observe the international code of 
behavior in Europe. 
  In the long run, the CSCE member states should commit 
themselves to common action against those who disturb the peace, 
should jointly call on the UN Security Council, and, at the same 
time, commit themselves to jointly implement the decisions of 
the Security Council. 
  Fifth: The expansion of the EU's relations with Russia plays 
a key role. 
  Russia remains a first-class actor on the international 
political stage: This is proved by its permanent seat on the UN 
Security Council. However, the old thinking in terms of spheres 
of influence is outdated now. The term of "near abroad," which 
we now occasionally hear from Moscow, can be misunderstood; it 
does not fit at all in a time of global interdependence. 
  Russia's economic integration is even more important than 
the security policy dimension. Russia must be fully integrated 
into the international economy with a division of labor. The EU 
is negotiating a partnership and cooperation agreement with 
Russia. Russia must be able to grow into the G-7, first 
politically and then also economically! 
  Sixth: Unreserved German participation in the United Nations 
for safeguarding world peace. 
  Despite all weaknesses, the United Nations is the only 
global 
instrument of collective security. The known difficulties of 
the United Nations, e.g. in Bosnia, cannot be a reason to throw 
in the towel. Thus, it was important that the United Nations 
got involved in Somalia -- its mission saved the lives of 
hundreds of thousands of people. And it was right that we 
Germans were there, too! 
  The number of UN missions has skyrocketed over the past 
years. Currently, more than 70,000 soldiers from 68 countries 
are serving in 16 crisis regions in the world, and this almost 
always under very dangerous conditions. 
  However, there is no alternative to the international 
organization if one wants to prevent a return to the right of 
might. However, we also know that the rule of law in the world 
cannot be established with the stroke of a pen. We are facing a 
long way, at the end of which the United Nations can become what 
its founding fathers hoped for: The central guardian of peace 
in the world. 
  Not least because of our historical past, Germany is morally 
obliged to participate in defending peace. Without the 
readiness to do so, Germany would be unable to be in the 
alliance and to act. Our vital interests as an economic, trade, 
and cultural nation in the world would also be hurt. Therefore, 
it is important that our Federal Constitutional Court soon 
brings about the constitutional clarification of this central 
issue, which I have long been striving for. 
  Already, in 1992, I made our desire for a permanent seat on 
the UN Security Council clear at the UN General Assembly -- not 
out of megalomania but because I am convinced that the 
unavoidable greater responsibility makes Germany's corresponding 
say and participation in decisionmaking necessary. 
  Seventh: Our interests have become global; this gives rise 
to new focuses in our foreign and security policy. 
  The upheavals of the present go far beyond Europe. Problems 
such as global environmental protection or the growth of the 
world's population are moving right to the head of the 
international agenda. In Asia, new actors are stepping on the 
stage of international policy and international economy. The 
new industrial states in Asia are challenging us; at the same 
time they offer our companies new great opportunities on their 
growing markets. It is necessary to be present in these regions 
of the future. 
  Generally, it holds true today: Conflicts that are taking 
place thousands of kilometers from us directly affect our 
country and our people. North Korea is an example of a remote 
conflict with global consequences. It is rightly feared that a 
North Korea that has nuclear arms might start a nuclear arms 
race in eastern Asia. North Korea must be dissuaded from its 
efforts to get nuclear weapons. 
  Germany, as a nonnuclear state, has a central interest in 
the 
success of nonproliferation. One of our main goals is to have 
the Nonproliferation Treaty as a central element of the 
international nonproliferation policy extended next year without 
a time limit and unconditionally. Therefore, last December, I 
presented a "10-point plan" for nuclear nonproliferation. 
  Because of the profound changes over the past years, Germany 
has achieved a key position for Europe's future. However, we 
must not misunderstand our increased political weight as a call 
for national solo actions. On the contrary: Today -- far more 
than in the past and far more than others -- we are responsible 
for all of Europe. 
  Our national interest is identical with all-European 
responsibility. We do not evade this responsible, we accept it 
with reason and determination. In this we let ourselves be 
guided by a statement made by Thomas Mann. As early as 1953, he 
advised striving for "a Germany as a self-confidently serving 
link in a Europe united by self-confidence." This is what we 
want to be!

<F P=106> ["ry"-signed report: "Bonn Has Little Chance of Becoming </F>
Headquarters of World Trade Organization"] 
  [Excerpt] Geneva -- Only four weeks after the ceremonious 
signing of the GATT agreement in Marrakesh, all the old points 
of contention are gradually resurfacing. The question of who 
should succeed GATT Director General Sutherland also remains 
open. 
  Since the signing of the GATT agreement on 15 April, the 
outcome of the Marrakesh talks was officially discussed by the 
Council of the UN Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]. 
Differences of opinions also surfaced at the first meeting of 
the Preparatory Committee [Prepcom] of the planned World Trade 
Organization [WTO]. However, the UNCTAD Council adhered more or 
less to what the ministers had said in Marrakesh. The final 
result was once again lauded as "historic." The WTO-Prepcom 
dealt mainly with procedural matters such as the appointment of 
chairmen of subcommittees. Further chairmen are due to be 
appointed over the next six weeks, so that the formation of the 
WTO may begin at all levels afterward. 
  Thorny issues such as Director General Sutherland's plans to 
resign; whether WTO headquarters should be in Geneva or Bonn; 
the chances of ratifying the Marrakesh results, especially by 
the Americans; and the WTO's spheres of activity; were discussed 
in a more intimate circle because of their controversy. 
  Peter Sutherland, the "savior of the Uruguay round of 
talks," 
has confirmed during informal consultations that he does not 
intend to be chairman of the WTO. But neither has he given the 
required six months' notice to quit the GATT chairmanship. 
Therefore one assumes he will stay on until GATT changes into 
the WTO which, according to the current schedule, should occur 
on 1 January 1995. He says that his decision is dictated by 
"personal motives." Not everyone believes this. 
  Needless to say, there is now a debate on the subject of 
Sutherland's successor. The developing countries, which will 
now form the GATT majority, want to have the GATT chairmanship, 
and the Latin American countries, which were in the lead already 
after the demise of Sutherland's predecessor, the Swiss Arthur 
Dunkel, also seem to have good chances of getting it. 
  Regardless of this, Sutherland also has the power to hold 
negotiations on the new GATT chairmanship. Participants in 
these negotiations would include Andras Szepesi, Hungarian 
chairman of the GATT member countries committee, and the 
chairmen of the WTO-Prepcom subcommittees. Most GATT officials 
and employees in the diplomatic missions of the 125 GATT member 
countries take a gloomy view of Bonn becoming WTO headquarters. 
They would not like to leave their comfortable surroundings on 
Lake Geneva. 
  But the official reason why Bonn should not be WTO 
headquarters is that the WTO would be cut off from its related 
organizations in Geneva, with whom it must remain in close touch 
when discussing certain matters, such as the GATT-WTO 
conversion. For example, UNCTAD has been charged with examining 
and explaining the economic effects of the Marrakesh agreement. 
In Bonn, such a concentration of tasks would not be possible 
because there are no other world trade organizations there. 
  Last week, the Federal Government made a sudden offer to 
GATT 
and suggested Bonn for WTO headquarters. A decision will 
probably be reached in Geneva in the coming weeks. The Swiss 
offer that is currently being discussed between the Swiss 
authorities and GATT Director General Sutherland also has to be 
considered. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Karl-Ludwig Guensche: "Wanted: A Place for </F>
Russia in Europe"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Karl Lamers, the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag group's foreign 
policy expert, has spoken out for reconsidering the West's 
support for Russia. In a paper entitled "How To Help Russia? -- 
Ways and Limitations of Supporting the Reform Process," he says 
that Russia's preconditions for transferring to a democratic 
constitutional state and a market economy have "clearly 
deteriorated as a result of the parliamentary elections and the 
continuing economic crisis." Millions of people in Russia today 
associate reform policy with instability, supply shortages, 
unemployment, high crime rates, a declining international 
reputation, and the loss of Russia's superpower status. Europe, 
and Germany in particular, is especially interested in a stable, 
economically sound, and predictable neighbor to the east. Help 
for Russia, therefore, means "an active security and peace 
policy." Yet, Western support can only be effective if Russia 
itself does everything it can to promote the reform process, 
Lamers emphasized. "The country does not need fewer, but more 
reforms." The West must be prepared to be Russia's partner and 
to install a network of friendly cooperation between the 
European Union, NATO, and Russia. But it must also be prepared 
to show Russia its place. "Claims to special rights and looking 
for special ways do not help Russia." Although Russia must find 
a place in Europe that is appropriate to its size, "being part 
of the new Europe also means giving up its superior role, not 
insisting on special rights vis-a-vis its neighbors." 
  Unless Russia answers the central question as to whether it 
wants to be a "national state or an empire," as long as it 
considers its role of world power more important than 
establishing an efficient administration, a modern economy, and 
a social security system, the country will not come to rest, the 
CDU/CSU expert warns. That is why further financial aid to 
Russia -- especially by the IMF -- should not be granted as "an 
advance signal of trust, but only as an acknowledgment of 
reforms effected so far." Otherwise, this would mean awarding 
premiums for "wrong decisions instead of reforms."

<F P=106> [Interview with Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt by </F>
Dietmar Seher; place and date not given: "Debts Not To Be Paid 
With MiGs"] 
  [Text] [Seher] You have achieved an agreement with the 
Russian delegation on the delivery of railroad passenger cars by 
Deutsche Waggonbau AG [DWA]. How do you assess this achievement? 
  [Rexrodt] As a breakthrough and a success. The Russians 
have promised that orders at a value of 500 million German marks 
[DM] will go to [DWA in] Ammendorf this year. This means that 
the jobs there will be secure. Good prospects are established 
because this makes it possible to bridge the time until 1996. 
Afterwards, it is to be expected that Western orders will take 
up more capacities in the factory. 
  [Seher] What will happen in 1995? Your agreement says that 
orders are then to be issued at a lower level. At what level? 
  [Rexrodt] The orders for 1995 must still be negotiated. For 
1996 it has been agreed that we will enter close cooperation 
with DWA in Russia itself. This means that wagons will be built 
there and know-how will be transferred. 
  [Seher] Thus, the 2,000 employees may stay for the time 
being. 
  [Rexrodt] Detailed decisions about the number of employees 
will have to be made by the company management. But the 
imminent disaster has been averted. 
  [Seher] Will there be Hermes guarantees to secure the 
orders? 
  [Rexrodt] Yes, full guarantees. 
  [Seher] German companies have explained that their 
investments are taxed too highly in Russia. Did this play a 
role in the negotiations? 
  [Rexrodt] Not now. But it was a subject during my visit to 
Russia three weeks ago and of the talks that I held at the 
West-East conference in Warsaw. The issue is not just taxes but 
much more -- customs duties, methods of administration, the 
functioning of the banking systems. All this runs under the 
heading of investment conditions. They must be improved and 
made predictable. Indeed, there has been taxation on 
investments in Russia. It has been indicated to us that this 
will be abolished very soon, that everything was a 
misunderstanding. 
  [Seher] During their visit to Germany, the Russian 
delegation complained about an insufficient opening up of the 
markets of the European Union [EU] and the West to Russian 
products. Are these complaints justified? 
  [Rexrodt] No, I think they are not justified. As of next 
year the European Union will have completely open markets for 
Russia -- except for some steel products and some textile 
products and, of course, the agricultural sector. 
  [Seher] It is said that Moscow has offered to pay its debt 
with goods, such as with Russian nuclear power plants and MiG-29 
planes. Is this correct? 
  [Rexrodt] I have never been told about nuclear power plants. 
But MiG-29 planes? Yes, indeed. This was said. We have 
rejected this. It does not fit in with our military and 
research policy considerations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Klaus Murmann, president of the Employers </F>
Association, by Rolf Bier; place and date not given: "This is 
what Industry Thinks of Scharping...."] 
  [Text] [Bier] With what government would industry be best 
able to cooperate after the elections? 
  [Murmann] With one that further reduces public spending, 
cuts the taxation and debt burden, and tackles structural 
reforms in the social security system. 
  [Bier] What does industry think of Scharping as a 
chancellor...? 
  [Murmann] Securing Germany as a business location is also 
one of Mr. Scharping's aims. But I fear that the actual policy 
of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] would fall back 
into its old models and thinking patterns, for instance 
regarding taxation and monetary policy. 
  [Bier] ...And what about a red-green coalition? 
  [Murmann] I prefer a Kohl government. The economy and a 
red-green coalition are not at all a favorable perspective for 
Germany as a business location. I do not think much of putting 
together certain and uncertain risks. 
  [Bier] What do you think of the SPD's plans to change the 
solidarity surcharge to a tax on higher incomes? 
  [Murmann] I have already spoken of patterns laden with 
ideology. I would like to warn against attacking top 
performers. If the SPD sticks with exchanging the solidarity 
surcharge for a supplementary charge after the election 
campaign, it will also have to increase taxes. 
  [Bier] What do you think of a super ministry combining 
economic and financial affairs? 
  [Murmann] Although I am very much in favor of reducing the 
number of ministries, and although the work of the economics 
ministry urgently needs to be reconsidered, I favor keeping them 
separate. 
  [Bier] Do government employment promotion programs help 
industry? 
  [Murmann] Government employment programs burden the existing 
jobs through additional taxes. But we need cheaper jobs to get 
the unemployed back to work. This cannot be done overnight, but 
it is the only sensible solution.

<F P=106> [Interview with Free Democratic Party presidential candidate </F>
Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher by Margit Gerste and Gunter Hoffman; 
place and date not given: "Defining Our Identity Anew"] 
  [Text] [DIE ZEIT] Frau Hamm-Bruecher, 1989 was a year of 
great changes. But since then people have become concerned 
about the direction in which the united republic is heading. 
What do you wish had happened? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] I wish we had learned from western 
experience 
as much as we learned from eastern experience. This wish 
incorporates my dream, which, as is usually the case with 
dreams, is somewhat of an illusion. Things probably could not 
have happened differently from the way they did, but I think we 
missed an opportunity to stop for a moment and examine what was 
proceeding successfully, what was not proving successful, and 
what we should change. But instead, we in the west thought: 
Well, we have to pay the solidarity tax surcharge for a certain 
length of time, and apart from that the people in the east must 
do the same as us. Most people here in the west have never 
even considered the fact that people in the east have totally 
different feelings and habits than we do, and that great efforts 
are required to adapt. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Many people say that the Federal Republic was 
also merely a sort of antechamber and that the chamber of 
history is now empty. What do you think should be kept intact? 
What kind of heritage should we protect? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] Our "antechamber" has repeatedly produced 
excellent democrats; we have overcome difficult cases; and we 
have succeeded in reconciling the Germans to democracy which, by 
the way, was always linked to economic growth and prosperity. 
This is something that one must not only protect, but also 
develop. 
  [DIE ZEIT] But one can extend the argument. Michael 
Stuermer, Joachim Fest, and others have claimed that the past 40 
years were but a diversion and now the Federal Republic can 
follow the correct road at last. Do you agree? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] It was a diversion insofar as we Germans 
have finally realized that after one failure, or two if you 
include the year 1848, democracy and free coexistence require a 
new path. If people choose to see that as a diversion of the 
old Federal Republic, that means that we are heading toward 
quite a dangerous and reactionary tradition. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Do the politicians realize this? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] No. There is an odd nostalgia for that part 
of German history that is worthy of display, to the exclusion of 
that part of German history that is best forgotten. That is 
dangerous. We imagine that at last we have a democracy and have 
completed our task. But in fact we must continue to work at it 
for a long time. 
  [DIE ZEIT] One cannot say that we have come more Protestant, 
liberal, and reform-minded since unification? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] No. But even in the West, the new openness, 
the realization that democracy is a form of coexistence that is 
not limited to official institutions, did not materialize until 
the end of the 1950's. We were also in a period of desolation 
then. Look at all the men who fell in the war or were wounded 
well as the incorrigible Nazis. No wonder there was no strength 
for renewal after 1945. It took a long time to find this 
strength. After 1989, many people in the West remained forsaken 
and depressed. Because of that, renewal might only be possible 
in 10 years. As you can see, I am hopelessly optimistic. Even 
so I find our lack of concern about how a democracy is supposed 
to develop on the threshold of the third millennium dangerous. 
Representative democracy on its own serves no further purpose, 
and all the political parties are handing the idea of 
participatory democracy with kid gloves. On the other hand, we 
have a "spectator democracy" with citizens who feel that if they 
are only permitted to vote every four years, all they can do is 
sit and watch the politicians and criticize them. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Some people recommend a sense of pride and 
participation as a recipe for national awareness. As a liberal, 
does the question of national identity have any relevance for 
you? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] No, I doubt whether the old type of 
nationalism and patriotism have to be rediscovered and whether 
women can do anything with these values. For me this is the 
domain of men. Other things are more important for me. We must 
make a serious attempt to redefine our identity. But this is 
not the kind of patriotism illustrated by the saying "whether 
the country does right or whether it does wrong, it is still my 
country." It is something that involves a feeling for spiritual 
and cultural values, not to mention an awareness of the failures 
and terrible wars we have experienced this century. 
  We are discussing values that must be defended, on the one 
hand, and necessary changes on the other. Can one not say that 
Germany's openness to refugees is part of its identity? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] Yes. That is also the reason why I find it 
so difficult to accept the change in the asylum law. Of course, 
I also see the reality. But the asylum law is not just a 
reaction to the fortunes of those who fled from Nazism. It is 
also a genuine result of the changes. The things that burden us 
and have a bearing on our consciousness are also a part of our 
identity, for example the way one views human rights. Some of 
the things that were said in the debate on the expulsion of the 
Kurds sounded as if there was no right of asylum in Germany any 
more. We must face up to these things. And when I consider all 
this, I regret that I am no longer at the beginning of my 
political life, but at the end. That is why I am so keen on 
running for the post of president, because it gives me another 
opportunity to oppose these alarming trends. 
  [DIE ZEIT] What is it that holds a disoriented society 
together? Is it common values? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] As a liberal, I oppose any kind of 
indoctrination. On the other hand, we must consider in what way 
we can teach young people to resist temptations posed by the 
media and the behavior of adults. One must realize that one 
cannot only do things that are to one's own advantage. One must 
also work to the advantage of others, something that often 
involves sacrifices. 
  [DIE ZEIT] What do you think of the liberal opinions in the 
media, parliament, and the parties? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] The unique candle procession, for instance, 
was more than just a demonstration. It represented liberal 
public opinion. People did not have to be told to get up and do 
something to display their feelings. They just did it. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Have you any criticism of us journalists? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] Yes. Journalists play down such phenomena 
as a greater degree of social commitment. It is not spectacular 
enough for them. I even find the liberal press rather 
disillusioned. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Perhaps because liberal opinion manifests itself 
mainly as a kind of background noise? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] There is a constant overfeeding. Things used 
to be much clearer before. It also used to be more important 
whether or not one appeared in DIE ZEIT. But, unfortunately, 
DIE ZEIT is no longer the political institution that it used to 
be. 
  [DIE ZEIT] In that case, where do you see liberal 
authorities and persons linked to them? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] Generally speaking, it takes more effort 
these days to prevent something than to change it. That takes a 
lot of energy. First we have to overcome right-wing extremist 
violence before we can consider any constructive political 
moves, otherwise we cannot establish a basis for peaceful 
coexistence between Germans and foreigners. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Do you think that people encounter the limits of 
politics so frequently that they no longer care what you do as a 
politician or as a journalist? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] Even a parliamentary deputy becomes 
powerless 
when he thinks every single political faction in compliance with 
Article 38 of the Basic Law meeting means a loss of his 
identity. When someone is not as crazy as I am, one can say: 
Personal commitment is useless, so adapt yourself. But one 
should establish a political career not just through adjustment. 
It is bad that instead of doing something because of its 
importance and then introducing it to the rest of society, one 
introduces it first and then says it is impossible to achieve. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Would a future president have to do it? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] I believe there is motivation to attempt a 
joint course of action again, because the question of party 
democracy versus a civil society remains unresolved. The 
political parties are no longer able to implement the idea of 
democracy as an ideal and as a reality and impart soul and life 
to it. 
  [DIE ZEIT] How about a democracy without parties? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] Impossible. But one day there might be a 
formation gathering, for example, all the Pfluegers, Suessmuths, 
Geisslers, Hamm-Bruechers, Hirschs, Gansels, and so on. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Are you in favor of an erasure of the GDR past, 
or 
a reappraisal thereof? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] I know that what is being done is not right, 
but I know of no better way of doing it, because the damage in 
the GDR after 12 years was much deeper and more far-reaching 
than here. To a major extent, the Germans were convinced Nazis. 
But I do not think they were communists or SED [Socialist Unity 
Party of Germany] supporters to the same extent. But we are 
combining the Nazi dictatorship with the SED. That is 
impermissible. 
  This reminds me of the case of Maunz, former Bavarian 
culture 
minister, whom I helped topple in 1964. I consider it a scandal 
that a man like Maunz, following his resignation, could become 
one of the most respected law professors in Germany. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Finally, I would like to ask you about the 
presidential election on 23 May. We have the impression that 
the FDP has not promoted your candidacy with enough militancy, 
and there are even rumors that some people in the party 
leadership want to make clear already in the first round of the 
vote that Herzog is assured of a majority. Does this bother you? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] I do not think that will happen, and I 
expect broad support for my party. 
  [DIE ZEIT] But the question of a presidential candidate's 
liberal qualities must come before coalition business? 
  [Hamm-Bruecher] Yes. It is important for me that in the end, 
every democrat is accountable for his own actions. I have been 
trying to do that for 40 years.

<F P=106> [Article by Albrecht Hinze: "Jens Reich, Candidate for the </F>
Federal Presidency: A Challenger by Training"] 
  [Text] Berlin, end of April--Is the way already the goal? 
Of course, Jens Reich himself does not contemplate that he could 
become the next federal president, and has never done so. In the 
end, at the third or fourth ballot in the federal assembly on 
Whit Sunday, Johannes Rau and Roman Herzog will settle this 
between themselves; in this regard the physician, scientist, and 
essayist has no illusions. Nevertheless, the former GDR civil 
rights supporter regards his candidacy as an independent, 
lateral entrant for the succession of Richard von Weizsaecker by 
no means as superfluous and unsuccessful. He perceives his 
candidature as a spiritual, social, and political challenge, 
which corresponds to that of German unification and could help 
accomplish it. Accordingly, the way would really be more 
important than the goal. 
  But Jens Reich explicitly does not want to be "a combat or 
protest candidate of the `Ossis' [eastern Germans]." Yet this is 
absolutely how many eastern Germans understand him. Differently 
from the western German presidential candidates, he, so it seems 
to them, brings the greatest insight to the designation and 
explanation of their social and economic insecurities and 
worries, their history and their self-perception. His 
biography--the long hesitant perseverance in the private 
niche--is also something with which many eastern Germans can 
identify. That all of Reich's appeals to the former GDR citizens 
to stop complaining now and to put aside inferiority complexes 
are hardly being noticed is another matter. When Reich 
interprets eastern German conditions in the west, he encounters, 
as a rule, interested and sympathetic attention, especially 
among intellectuals. In the east he frequently earns applause 
from all segments of the audience, frequently standing ovations. 
There would be no doubt who should hold the highest state 
office. There people also accept with indulgence that Reich, 
when he lets his thoughts run while speaking, does not complete 
a sentence quite conclusively. Or that he quite openly admits 
not to understand anything about an issue. 
<H5>  The Play Dead Reflex </H5>
  When Reich at the beginning of February in the National 
Theater of Weimar on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the 
Weimar National Assembly talked with opponents Hildegard 
Hamm-Bruecher and Roman Herzog about federal presidents and 
constitution, unity in Germany and Europe, and a few other 
things, he would bave become federal president if the applause 
could have decided it. Subsequently Reich returns to Berlin by 
train traveling second class and, impressed, talks about the 
witty, baroque Herzog, with whom one can brilliantly and 
ingeniously discuss society and the state in Germany. 
  Toward the end of the 1980's, a Thomas Asperger occasionally 
published articles in OSTEUROPA-FORUM or in the cultural journal 
LETTRE INTERNATIONAL. Nobody knew the author. The Ministry of 
State Security, too, was at a loss. The writer had to be someone 
from East Germany, that is how well informed and sympathetically 
he dealt with the situation and the consciousness of the GDR 
people under the living conditions of real socialism. It was 
Jens Georg Reich, at that time professor of medicine at Humboldt 
University and scientist at the Center for Molecular Biology of 
the GDR Academy of Sciences, who concealed himself behind the 
pseudonym. Thomas Asperger was a school friend of Reich in 
Halberstadt, who was torn apart shortly after the war by a blind 
shell. 
  At the beginning of 1988, Reich had found his GDR niche in 
the "Friday Circle," a group of scientists who got angry or 
amused themselves about the conditions in the country, hardly 
perceptible to the outside and without effects. The Catholic 
Reich finally entered internal emigration when in 1984 he lost 
his post as director of the Molecular Biology Center because he 
refused to join the SED or a coalition party. Today Reich admits 
that he and others, against their better judgment, had resigned 
themselves too long to a helpless, opportunistic "play dead 
reflex," one should have protested strongly much sooner. People 
in the east now and then take offense at such a self-reproach. 
It contradicts the private and collective guilt defense 
mechanism built up for self-defense. 
  In a politically effective and visible manner the names of 
the physicians Eva and Jens Reich surfaced for the first time 
under the then-sensational and revolution-triggering appeal "The 
Time Is Ripe," which the beginning citizen movement New Forum 
was able to publish still illegally on 9 September 1989--with 
unexpected success: More than 200,000 people signed the appeal 
within weeks. This was not yet an appeal for an insurrection, 
but rather a request to the rulers to reform socialism 
democratically in a social dialogue. 
  Jens Reich became visible publicly on 4 November 1989. It 
was 
the large demonstration of perhaps 500,000 people at the 
Alexander Square in Berlin, who scanned "We are the people." A 
slim, tall man stepped up to the microphone, in the early 
fifties, with thick glasses and short-cropped grey hair. In a 
soft, almost brittle voice, but in clear, precise language, 
Reich demanded from a platform on a truck "elections that 
deserve this name," freedom for dissenters, the observation of 
constitutional rights, which after all existed in the GDR 
according to the law. In those few days before the opening of 
the borders on November 9, 1989, according to Reich's 
assessment, there existed the chance of a real revolution, the 
immediate overthrow of the SED. Already at that time, however, 
the citizens movement was disunified and indecisive. The change 
possibly would not have proceeded so peacefully. 
  As many others in the citizens movement, Jens Reich would 
have wished for the GDR, at the end still transformed into a 
democracy, a longer and more self-conscious life, so that there 
could have been more thorough negotiations about unification. 
Reich would have preferred a confederation with the long-term 
goal of state unity. Thus he voted with the People's Chamber 
caucus against the accession of the GDR to the Federal Republic 
already on 3 October 1990. This took place on 23 August 1990. At 
that time, even the unification treaty had not yet been 
concluded, which was and is criticized as ill-advised and hasty. 
Today Reich says the financial and economic consequences were 
foreseeable. According to him, the mental consequences, in the 
west as well as in the east, proved to be much more devastating. 
The foreign policy security arrangements by Kohl and Genscher, 
on the other hand, he regards as nothing short of masterful. 
  Paradoxically, it was Federal Chancellor Kohl who provided 
the impetus for the so uncomfortable candidacy of the private 
person Jens Reich. Kohl deemed, it was perhaps at the beginning 
of 1993, that the next federal president, in order to promote 
the unity of Germany, should be an eastern German. In so doing, 
however, he had hardly in mind a representative of the citizens 
movement (especially not a leftist), but politicians like Berndt 
Seite or Heinz Eggert, and in the end--already under 
increasingly hardening political pressure from his party--the 
unhappy Steffen Heitmann. Even the social democrat Richard 
Schroeder would have been a possibility if the SPD had not 
staked out party policy interests with the nomination of Rau. 
Thereupon in June of last year the intellectuals from 
"Frankfurter Einmischung" [Frankfurt Intervention] made their 
appearance. The party-encompassing association, conservative in 
terms of its values, whose members include politicians of all 
camps, journalists, historians, and sociologists, proposed, 
crosswise to the spectrum of the parties, a number of well-known 
people. Ignatz Bubis refused, as did Hans Magnus Erzenberger. 
Jens Reich, by contrast, did not refuse. After 2.5 years of 
resignation--the experiences in and with the People's Chamber 
had contradicted his ideals too strongly--he returned to 
politics. 
  The reaction of the federal parties ranged from indifference 
to intransigence. But in all of them there turned out to be 
secret sympathizers. Only Alliance 90/Greens were receptive to 
the idea, without, however, elevating Reich as official 
candidate. Now he is a candidate for the highest state office 
and in so doing can count on a great deal of sympathy, but 
hardly has organization at his disposal and lacks any 
traditional party policy linkage and experience. Of all the 
candidates, Reich certainly has the greatest and most 
far-reaching visions of citizen democracy, for which, however, 
he is reproached--as naive, illusionary visions. He takes in 
this reproach and turns it around: In his "belief in rational, 
emotional, democratic dialogue" and in his "faith in public 
discourse", he says, he likes to be naive, for everything else 
appears to him as "cynical or fundamentalist." 
<H5>  Fourteen Theses for the Future </H5>
  His conceptions of how he would manage as federal president, 
Reich has depicted in a multitude of speeches, discussions, 
interviews, articles, and essays, and three books on this 
subject are on the market. Moreover, he has presented 14 
programmatic theses for a "Future Project Germany": The task of 
the federal president "is to stimulate social developments, to 
keep open suppressed topics, to promote discourse, to exert a 
moderating and integrating effect, and in so doing to introduce 
his own person and opinion." Moreover, Reich regards it as 
appropriate and just that, after 40 years of dictatorship in the 
GDR and because of the agitating consequences of unity in 
eastern Germany, the next federal president should place his 
center of gravity there. Quite in the tradition of the citizens 
movement, he champions the idea that the Basic Law should 
include social constitutional goals as well as elements of 
direct democracy. With his thoughts about the responsible use of 
gen-technology and the protection of Germany as a location for 
science, Reich has--in the sense of the discourse advocated by 
him--provided impulses for public discussions. 
  The registered association "Buergerpraesident [Citizens' 
President] Jens Reich" in Berlin supports the candidate with a 
little organization and coordination. Young socialists, young 
liberals, young members of the CDU/CSU, and young Greens have 
united. There people console themselves in the face of the 
foreseeable failure in the Federal Assembly with the promising 
consideration: Could it not be that, before the third ballot, 
Rau and Herzog demonstratively forego the votes of the PDS and 
the Republikaner respectively? Then candidate Reich perhaps 
could get a chance to make his move. As has been said before, 
the candidate himself does not believe in this.

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Kroeter: "Three Servants of Their </F>
Masters"] 
  [Text] As national secretary of the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany (SPD) in the mid-1980's, Peter Glotz coined the 
slogan that politics is "the work of bringing things to a head." 
Heiner Geissler, the Social Democrat's adversary in his capacity 
as the general secretary of the Christian Democratic Union 
(CDU), further refined this work into an art--"seizing" topics, 
formulating arguments in such a way that they can serve as 
weapons in the political struggle, and creating the capacity to 
marshal one's own troops in the proper battle formation and to 
produce potential majorities. What Glotz was wont to formulate 
in a theoretical manner, was Geissler's practical application. 
  Guenter Verheugen, who rounded out the Bonn trio for the 
Free 
Democratic Party (FDP) in those years, remembers that there was 
a certain "sense of elitism" on the part of the party managers 
back then. Verheugen left the liberals after they switched and 
formed a coalition with the CDU and is now doing the job for a 
second time--this time as the successor once removed of Peter 
Glotz. The days of the "big three" are only nostalgia now. 
Verheugen's Bonn colleagues are now called Werner Hoyer (FDP) 
and Peter Hintze (CDU). 
  "The general secretary supports the chairman in the 
performance of his duties. In concert with the chairman, he 
conducts the party's business." These two sentences from 
Paragraph 37 of the CDU's by-laws precisely describe the 
functions of the other two party managers as well. All the 
strings for the exhausting nonstop 1994 election campaign come 
together in their hands. They have to get the machinery running 
up to full speed and that means, above all, focusing their 
activities on their top candidates--Helmut Kohl, Klaus Kinkel, 
and Rudolf Scharping. 
  Despite the fact that the three party headquarters are close 
to each other on or next to Bonn's "diplomats' race track," they 
rather seldom see one another. "He treats me with respect," 
observes Verheugen curtly about the liberal Werner 
Hoyer--discreetly remaining silent about the fact that many 
people in the FDP fondly remember his time in the Thomas Dehler 
House. Nonetheless, he recently got a visit from a colleague: 
When the dispute was on over nursing care insurance, Peter 
Hintze showed up at the head of a small demonstration in front 
of the Social Democratic "barracks." After reading a brief 
polemic text about the SPD's rejectionist position, he turned 
over the megaphone he had brought along and thus the Social 
Democrat unexpectedly became the main speaker at a CDU 
demonstration. "I had not imagined that it would be that easy," 
Verheugen smirked. The little anecdote illustrates one of his 
rules of thumb for the unwritten textbook of political action: 
"Politics: It is 90 percent skilled craftsmanship and 10 percent 
substance." 
  A scene from the life of a national secretary: "It is a 
decision" says Guenter Verheugen into the mouthpiece of the 
telephone. Pause. The interlocutor on the other end of the line 
is apparently contradicting--at length. "He does not want it" 
says Guenter Verheugen. This time the answer is considerably 
briefer. The interlocutor gives in. Not only the success 
achieved by the five short words, but even the call is 
noteworthy. A little while ago--to be precise, in those nearly 
forgotten days when a certain Bjoern Engholm...--a leading 
Social Democratic politician would not have so readily called up 
the national secretary and coordinated his statements for an 
interview with the party line. As if it were the most natural 
thing in the world, Verheugen succeeds in pronouncing the "he" 
as if it were written in capital letters: HE wants it, HE wants 
it this way, HE does not want it. In accordance with these three 
principles, this HE has come forward to reshape the SPD for the 
upcoming election campaign. There are three problems associated 
with this kind of bringing things to a head: Work, work, work. 
And the three answers: Scharping, Scharping, Scharping. 
  It is not without irony that it is, of all things, a former 
liberal who is bringing the "SPD tanker" around to the 
traditional Social Democratic course of "Strength in Unity." 
That, however, is precisely the basic terms of reference for his 
being hired by Scharping: The head of the party stands at the 
center and must show leadership ability--and he simply can best 
demonstrate this to the national public if the party becomes a 
political machine for the election of its candidate for 
chancellor. If the boss occasionally comes a cropper--such as in 
the presentation of his tax policy proposals--then the only role 
left to the national secretary is to pick up the pieces--a 
vicious circle because the more Verheugen increases the power of 
the great chairman, the less amenable the latter becomes to 
advice. The results can be seen in the CDU. When CDU boss Helmut 
Kohl promoted his long-time political traveling companion Heiner 
Geissler out of the office of party manager, he did so with, 
among other things, the comment that he had become too much of a 
"general" for his liking and not enough of a "secretary." With 
this as a starting point, someone other than Hintze would have a 
hard time of it as well. Is it cynical to assume that his 
appointment is not a mistake--as the nearly unanimous view has 
it--but precisely what Helmut Kohl wanted? 
  He studied to be a pastor and is indeed a clever fellow and 
a 
stimulating conversation partner in a small circle. His ruthless 
analysis of the starting position in this superelection year 
even made believers of Christian Social Union (CSU) politicians 
who otherwise only make jokes at his expense. At public 
appearances, however, Hintze leaves a rather negative impression 
and not only when--as was the case at the CDU convention in 
Hamburg--there is an opportunity to directly compare his 
rhetorical talents with those of Heiner Geissler. Hintze is one 
of the few people who are just as nervous at the end of their 
speech as they are at the beginning--for good reason, since his 
scintillating brilliance in conversation always gets lost 
somewhere on the way to the podium. 
  Guenter Verheugen describes the work of a party manager as 
"providing orientation, externally as well as internally." 
Internally, many a shortcoming can be made up through 
organizational talent, yet when it comes to the public, a 
harmonious personality is required. The liberal, who has mutated 
into a Social Democrat, does not exemplify the "attack dog" type 
either--and he is not even trying to play the role. Hintze has 
consistently failed at it, yet instead of giving up, he is 
obsessed with trying to shake off the reputation of a political 
lightweight--without gaining in stature. He consoles himself by 
noting that "being underestimated also offers opportunities" and 
he defiantly points to the example of his chairman, who was 
similarly undervalued for a long time. Of course, he is too 
intelligent to ignore the possibility of failure: "Being a 
politician always means being a bit of a kamikaze as well." 
  Werner Hoyer, whose attempts at polemics seem hardly less 
labored, would scarcely disagree on that score, and not only 
because a modicum of chaos is part of the folklore of the 
liberals who passionately remove themselves from the clutches of 
discipline. If Hintze has to deal with a chairman who does not 
like to have more than one secretary around him, the FDP boss is 
all the more urgently in need of a general. Klaus Kinkel is 
experienced in government administration, but he is a newcomer 
to partisan politics. He cannot, of course, directly mention his 
boss' "need for an education" but Hoyer alludes to it when he 
emphasizes how important it is for the star of the party to get 
an electoral district and to become a member of the Bundestag 
caucus. The minister of foreign affairs also thought that Hoyer, 
as its former parliamentary secretary, would have the ideal 
qualifications to weld party and caucus together into a potent 
entity, yet what is needed for that, as the examples of the CDU 
and the SPD show, is a boss who is capable of submitting himself 
to advice and a team that is willing to exact such submission. 
Since both elements are missing, Hoyer can run up his telephone 
bill as much as he likes before the Monday meetings of the 
party's top leadership, and a Juergen Moellemann--in contrast to 
Scharping's defeated rival Gerhard Schroeder--is not going to 
toe the line. And party caucus boss Hermann Otto Solms will 
still remain in the "big eavesdropping session" at 
cross-currents with Kinkel. 
  How gladly would Werner Hoyer like to escape from this crude 
reality. He thrives when he can swoon about policy perspectives: 
Modern liberalism, of course, and a kind that will bring the FDP 
recognition of its stature at last--that is his dream. On that 
score the otherwise sober author of a textbook on microeconomics 
succumbs to the myth of Karl Hermann Flach and the "Freiburg 
Theses." Granted, scarcely a nonmember can still remember the 
FDP secretary general who died young nor would he know what was 
in the legendary policy document, but the man and the paper are 
emblematic of the dream of a "liberal identity" beyond the 
acquisition of power. 
  What will they do--will they want to do--after the 
elections? 
Peter Hintze, Werner Hoyer, and Guenter Verheugen do not fall 
into the trap of such inquiry. Somehow they all evade the 
question. The Social Democrat, who, the rumor mill has it, is a 
potential foreign minister, gives the most nonchalant answer: 
"Lie under a baobab tree, drink banana beer, and gaze into the 
blue African sky." A meeting of the party managers could be held 
there--even if it would likely be a forced vacation for one or 
another of them after 16 October.

<F P=106> ["uhl"-signed report: "CDU/CSU: Compromise Reached on </F>
Repurchasing"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- A team of experts from the CDU/CSU 
[Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] Bundestag 
Group and new laender governed by the CDU have reached agreement 
on the controversial repurchasing of agricultural and forestry 
land as part of the law on compensation. 
  CDU Minister Friedrich Bohl, chief of the federal 
chancellery, said he was optimistic that the liberals would also 
approve the proposal on which a consensus has now been achieved 
and that the reservations still being voiced by 
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania would be dispelled. 
  The detailed provisions of the proposal are as follows: 
  -- Former owners who were expropriated in the years 1945 to 
1949 as well as present leaseholders of agricultural and 
forestry land can purchase land from the land holdings being 
administered by the Trust Agency at a favorable rate 
corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the current market 
value; 
  -- About 73 percent of the land being administered by the 
Trust Agency has been reserved for eastern German leaseholders 
under the settlement program. An arbitration agency will be 
established for settling possible disputes between parties 
having interests in the land. 
  -- The possibilities envisaged by the draft law enabling 
former owners to repurchase land will be strengthened and take 
the form of a provision stating explicitly that such an option 
is available. There will be no claims to specific tracts of land. 
  -- As in the case of all others who are entitled to 
compensation, the level of compensation to be provided to former 
owners who wish to repurchase land will be verified and former 
owners will then receive bonds that can be redeemed until 2004. 
  -- Former owners who wish to repurchase land must apply for 
the purchase of land within six months of receiving a bond. 
  -- Valuations connected with the purchase of land will be 
conducted in accordance with criteria that are the same as those 
to be used for establishing the base rate for compensation. 
This means that the value of agricultural and forestry land in 
1935 will be multiplied by a factor of three. 
  -- However, the compensation provided in connection with 
repurchasing will be lowered, before the previous receipt of 
compensation for losses is considered, to take account of the 
possible loss of interest resulting from the early redemption of 
a bond and the general degressive reductions in compensation 
envisaged by the compensation law. 
  In concrete terms, this means that a former owner who lost 
50 
hectares of land can use compensation worth 57,000 German marks 
[DM] to repurchase 19 hectares of land. In the case of 100 
hectares, the compensation will amount to DM87,000, and the area 
of land to be repurchased will total 29 hectares. In the case 
of 500 hectares, the corresponding amounts are DM252,000 and 84 
hectares, and DM402,000 hectares and 134 hectares in the case of 
1,000 hectares. 
  -- To partially finance the repurchase of land on 
preferential terms, the 10-percent investment bonus (which 
amounts to DM1 billion) for the reinvestment of compensation in 
the new laender will be abolished. 
  Where the additional expenditure of DM1.5 billion is to come 
from still requires final clarification.

<F P=106> [Article by Henning Krumrey, Christian Reiermann, and Heiner </F>
Sieger: "Fatal Upswing; Positive Economic Data Conceal Pressing 
Structural Problems"] 
  [Text] They are now rejoicing again. There is no holding 
back the members of the coalition since the economic research 
institutes sighted a cautious cyclical recovery on Tuesday [26 
April] of last week. Rainer Haungs, economist with the CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union], derives "new confidence for 
Germany as a business location." 
  The first figures support him: the long-distressed chemical 
industry is reporting increased sales and even the ailing 
automotive industry is moving toward the future with confidence. 
  "The upswing in Germany is falling in step," rejoices Count 
Otto Lambsdorff (FDP [Free Democratic Party of Germany]). The 
"stagnation that we have suffered through" has by "no means been 
the most dramatic crisis of all time," says Kurt Faltlhauser, 
financial expert for the CSU [Christian Social Union]. And the 
federal chancellor again sees the German enterprises on the way 
to the top spot in the world. 
  If he is not deceiving himself. As cynical as it may seem, 
the upswing is coming too early. The happy news coming just in 
time for the election campaign makes structural reforms to 
secure the industrial site Germany seem superfluous. 
  One might have to pay dearly for this recklessness: 
  --If the state puts off urgent reform measures such as 
reduction of enterprise taxes or making the bloated public 
service more efficient and reorganizing the social state, 
  --if the trade unions drive wages up too soon, 
  --and if the enterprises fail to push the structural 
adjustments systematically, then the decline of the Germans to 
second-class status is programmed in advance. Germany could 
become the Argentina of the 21st century. 
  Warning voices: "The cyclical recovery is not a 
signal that the course has been set correctly," says Gernot 
Nerb, chief economist for the Ifo Institute in Munich. 
  Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt is already feeling 
pressure 
from the environmental and labor ministries to set aside the 
reform proposals in his industrial site program. 
  "I will not abandon my course," promises Rexrodt. "It is 
impossible to give up cost relief for trade and industry just 
because we half a half percent more growth." 
  Germany's decline can be calculated. The share of 
German exports in the world market has fallen for eight 
consecutive years. For more than a decade, productivity in 
German industry has been growing much more slowly than in the 
biggest competitors, the United States, Japan, France, and Great 
Britain. Whereas the English have achieved an increase in 
productivity of 4.4 percent in manufacturing since 1985, the 
German industry is lagging far behind with 1.6 percent. 
  The supposedly higher efficiency must nevertheless serve 
again and again to justify higher wages. "We must consider 
whether we can continue to afford this advantage in incomes," 
says Herbert hax, chairman of the council of experts. 
  The trade unions are already demanding an 
adjustment in view of the delicate "economic spring" 
(Kohl). Their motto: we have sacrificed wages in favor of the 
upswing and now we want to harvest the fruit. "The bitter lesson 
of the 1993 recession for the employment situation will soon be 
written off," fears Horst Siebert, one of the Five Wise Men. 
  "The trade unions expect employees to have an appropriate 
part in this success," is the slogan of Heinz-Werner Meyer, 
chairman of the German Federation of Trade Unions, for the next 
round of collective bargaining. 
  "The moderate wage agreements in the last round were not 
advance action for the upswing but only a partial correction of 
the excesses of the past," counters Alexander von Tippelskirch, 
board spokesman for the IKB German Industrial Bank. 
  If there is no reversal in wages, predicts Klaus-Werner 
Schatz, professor at the Institute for World Economics in Kiel, 
"then the upswing will go nowhere and there will not be a strong 
recovery." Stagnation will be followed by the next setback. 
  Political risk: Finance and tax policy determines 
prosperity and jobs more than ever, warn the research institutes 
in unison. The taxes for enterpreneurs and citizens must come 
down to stimulate growth and at the same time to force the state 
into vigorous economy measures. 
  But there is no sign of that. With respect to the subject of 
tax increases, the parties are arguing "only about how and not 
about whether," criticizes Ruediger Pohl, president of the 
Institute for Economic Research in Halle. "The tax burden for 
the next five years is no longer calculable." 
  On the executive floors of leading enterprises as well, 
there 
is growing concern about the incipient optimism in regard to the 
economy. In an upswing, the usual defensive fronts develop 
against painful but necessary cuts in the wild growth from 40 
years of success. 
  "Once the good mood is established, it will be much more 
difficult to rationalize," believes Helmut Werner, chief of 
Mercedes-Benz. In the most severe cyclical decline in the 
postwar era, the automotive concern eliminated one-fourth of all 
management positions and cut costs by 4 billion marks. "That was 
unthinkable a few years ago." 
  Fellow entrepreneur Peter Vischer, business manager of the 
medical equipment manufacturer Heraeus-Holding GmbH, has 
"concluded not even half of the massive reorganization in the 
enterprise." He sees the danger that "things will not be 
accomplished if suddenly everything goes well." 
  Anyone who thinks that he can lean back and relax in view of 
the looming upswing is missing the boat, thinks Siemens-chief 
Heinrich von Pierer as well: "We urgently need to resolve the 
structural problems to secure our international competitiveness 
in the long term," he says to damp rising optimism. 
  Some buckle under more quickly. At Volkswagen in 
Wolfsburg, the workers are not working more efficiently after 
the parallel reduction of working time and wages but only more 
briefly and still too expensively. The cars are not becoming 
less costly. There are just fewer salable cars being built. 
  Still: the enterprises have come the farthest on the way to 
reorganization. "They will accomplish the change in any case," 
believes banker von Tippelskirch. Only a small share will be 
left behind. The rest would be "stronger in international 
competition than before." It depends on the politicians and 
trade unionists "whether the jobs will be created here or 
abroad." 
  "The shock of the recession had a lasting effect," 
recapitulates economic researcher Pohl. The enterprises had 
reduced their costs, opened up new markets, and "are now letting 
sales people participate in product development rather than just 
the engineers." 
  Whereas the reorganization is proceeding only slowly 
domestically, the international competition is applying 
pressure. In Japan and the United States, enterprises trimmed 
down much faster and much more drastically. China is on the way 
to being a technology nation and is offering high-tech at 
favorable prices. 
  Danger is threatening from the immediate east as well. The 
reform countries in Central Europe are offering wages like those 
of developing countries but have educated specialists as in the 
industrial states, the Institute for World Economics has 
discovered. German firms are already also moving 
research-intensive production to the east. 
  The pressure could become ominous if the reforms 
do not take place. Economist Schatz fears a deadly chain 
reaction: 
  --the upswing is soon exhausted; 
  --the build-up of the new laender fades; 
  --unemployment remains high; 
  --taxes and contributions must rise to finance it; 
  --the distribution conflicts increase; 
  --the infrastructure decays; 
  --the development of new products and processes fails 
because 
of unwillingless to take risks and protracted approval 
procedures; 
  --with their obsolete products, the enterprises are no 
longer 
competitive and lose larger and larger market shares worldwide; 
and 
  --they invest increasingly in production sites abroad. 
  Gloomy outlook: Germany will become second-class, 
just an industrial museum. Such a decline is nothing new: 
Argentina has gone through it. 
  Still, there is growing resistance to the decline, at least 
verbally. "We must not idly watch developments," Tyll Necker, 
president of the Federal Association of German Industry, 
encourages himself. 
  Upswing '94--the danger is perceived but not yet averted.

  [Excerpts] The UN Security Council is meeting in New York 
to examine the situation in Rwanda. [passage omitted] 
  Rwanda was also on the agenda of the talks of the 12 foreign 
ministers in Brussels today. The Europeans have committed 
themselves to increase their humanitarian effort in favor of the 
victims of the civil war. They also want to try and give a 
fresh boost to the political negotiations process. This is what 
the French foreign minister [Alain Juppe] said after the meeting: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] What is happening in Rwanda at the 
moment deserves to be called a genocide. In the face of this 
unbearable situation, what can the international community do, 
and what will France do? 
  First of all, it must intensify its humanitarian aid. How 
can this humanitarian aid be forwarded, first of all to those 
Rwandan refugees in northern Burundi -- this is one of the 
points of implementation of France's humanitarian aid -- and 
then to Rwanda itself through the ICRC [International Committee 
of Red Cross], the nongovernmental organization which is most 
present on the ground right now in Rwanda? 
  Secondly, we must do our utmost so that an international 
humanitarian force is deployed on the ground as quickly as 
possible. It must be a UN force, since it is the only one which 
has the required speed and efficiency. 
  Thirdly, we must support mediators in the region. In that 
respect, the idea of a summit of the heads of state in the 
region -- which would make it possible to start fresh 
negotiations on the basis of the Arusha accords - is supported 
by France. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Randah Taqiyy-al-Din: "French Source Tells </F>
AL-HAYAH: No Secret Deals With Iraq; Rather, Disagreement With 
Washington Over Lifting of Embargo"] 
  [Text] Paris -- An official French source confirmed to 
AL-HAYAH yesterday the existence of differing positions between 
Paris and Washington vis-a-vis the international embargo imposed 
on Iraq. The source said that Paris is not concluding secret 
deals with that country. 
  The source pointed out that the United States refuses to 
lift 
the embargo as long as the Iraqi regime under President Saddam 
Husayn is in power, while France believes that lifting the 
embargo is linked to Iraq's implementation of the Security 
Council resolutions. 
  The source added that Foreign Minister Alain Juppe clarified 
his country's position to his U.S. counterpart Warren 
Christopher during his visit to Washington. 
  The source pointed out that the United States suspected 
France's political intentions, and thought that Paris was trying 
to make contacts with Iraqi officials. 
  The source added that the French Government is not 
concluding 
any secret deals with Iraq. But it insists that lifting the 
international embargo is linked to Iraq's implementation of the 
Security Council resolutions. And it believes that Iraq has not 
yet implemented all these resolutions, including recognizing 
Kuwait's sovereignty. 
  The source went on to say that there is clear progress with 
regard to implementing the other resolutions adopted by the 
council. And if Iraq implements all the resolutions required, 
France will ask the Council members to reconsider the embargo 
and to begin to engage Iraq in a six-month trial period after 
which the embargo would be lifted. The French source pointed 
out that the United States continues to reject a trial period.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mr. Lamassoure Will Judge the </F>
Italian Government on Its Actions"] 
  [Text] Questioned on the Luxembourg Radio and Television-LE 
MONDE "Grand Jury" program on Sunday, 15 May, on the appointment 
of five neofascist ministers to Silvio Berlusconi's government, 
European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said he had welcomed 
the fact that "our Italian friends and others were not as 
sectarian when France had Communist ministers in 1981." "It is 
in government," he said, "that we will now judge the whole team. 
From this viewpoint, the statements by Mr. Berlusconi himself 
strike us as satisfactory. We need a strong Italy." The 
presence of economist Antonio Martino in the post of foreign 
minister strikes him as boding well for Italy's internal 
economic reforms without threatening the European Union [EU] 
move toward the single currency. 
  "We cannot accept new members with the existing European 
institutions; we need a simpler system which is more efficient 
and more democratic," Mr. Lamassoure explained. While rejecting 
the prospect of an "a la carte Europe," which would enable each 
to take what interests him and leave the rest, the minister 
advocated a Europe of "variable geometry," provided that the 
ultimate objective is that all member states are involved in the 
same way in the EU. 
  "France and Germany are still the driving force of Europe 
for 
geographical and historical reasons," he added. "If France and 
Germany were unfortunately to disagree on important subjects, 
there would be two Europes." 
  Mr. Lamassoure, who visited Ukraine a short time ago, also 
explained that France is due to sumbit to the Twelve in Brussels 
on Monday a plan for the closure of the Chernobyl power plant 
"as soon as possible," and aid for the construction of three 
power stations. Finally, with regard to a successor to Delors, 
the minister said that the Twelve should not hesitate to choose 
a "weighty" person. He ruled out the candidacy of British 
Conservative Sir Leon Brittan, despite his "personal qualities."

  [Text] Paris, May 16 (AFP) -- French intellectuals will 
present a "Sarajevo list" in the European elections on June 12 
to denounce European inaction over Bosnia, French philospher 
Andre Gluckman said on Monday [16 May]. 
  Gluckman said the intention was "to explain to Europeans in 
general and to the French people in particular that their future 
is at stake over there (in Bosnia)." 
  In an interview with the right-wing daily LE QUOTIDIEN, 
Gluckman said the "prevailing consensus is not to speak of the 
massacres" in former Yugoslavia. 
  The Sarajevo list is being formed by Gluckman with writer 
and 
journalist Bernard-Henri Levy and could be headed by medical 
professor Leon Schwartzenberg. 
  Gluckman said political will was lacking to halt the war in 
former Yugoslavia although "we have the means" in NATO, which 
was conceived "to resist an army of five million soldiers with 
nuclear weapons, the Red Army." 
  Levy presented his film "Bosnia" at the Cannes Film Festival 
Sunday, a two-hour panegyric to Bosnian Moslem fighters that 
denounces European and American policy as preferring "a drip 
feed of humanitarian aid" to providing the Bosnians with arms to 
defend themselves.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Monory Wants UDF Candidate in </F>
Presidential Election] 
  [Text] Senate Speaker Rene Monory thinks it would be 
"appropriate for the UDF [French Democratic Union] to have a 
candidate in the 1995 presidential election. He said so on 
Radio J, adding that in the current context, a party without a 
candidate finds it hard to exist. According to Mr. Monory, 
should the majority have two candidates, "there would have to be 
a gentleman's agreement between them." Asked whether he would 
himself stand in the election, Rene Monory said that he was 
"quite relaxed" about it. "What I am interested in," he added, 
"is for the debate in the presidential campaign to be based on 
truth." 
  Mr. Monory would not want the future president of the 
Republic to be elected "on a fuzzy platform; otherwise, he would 
ultimately fail." Even though the French may not like it, there 
are a number of things that must be said. 
  Furthermore, any reforms being envisioned "must be announced 
before the election. This is a matter of sincerity," he said. 
As for the European election, Mr. Monory does not want to 
delude himself. He believes that 35 percent of the vote will be 
a good result for the majority's list. He also advises 
[majority list leader and Toulouse Mayor] Dominique Baudis not 
to get "too big for his britches" if he does achieve a good 
result. This was Mr. Monory's answer to a question about Mr. 
Baudis' intentions, which might be to stand in the presidential 
election after the European one.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F>
correspondent Franz-Olivier Giesbert in Paris-- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Good morning, Mr. Leotard. 
  [Leotard] Good morning. 
  [Giesbert] We have just heard a song sung by your brother, 
Philippe Leotard, who was advertising Scotch whisky. There are 
rumors that he was recently found wandering on a road in his 
pyjamas. Do you have news of him? Is it good news? 
  [Leotard] I do not know what you are talking about. I simply 
know that he is very talented. I have just heard him singing. 
He makes me dream. He writes, and I believe that this is a 
good thing. It is his role and I like it. It is his role, not 
mine. 
  [Giesbert] In a way, he is the anti-Francois Leotard. 
  [Leotard] You know, we are very fond of each other. You will 
not manage to drive a wedge between us. 
  [Giesbert] What I mean is that you do not present the same 
image. 
  [Leotard] He is a poet, he makes people dream. I do not make 
people dream. That is all, that is how things are. We do not 
have the same goals, the same job. 
  [Giesbert] Would you like to be in his shoes sometimes? 
  [Leotard] Naturally. I believe everyone would like to be 
someone else at times. 
  [Giesbert] Would you like to have a drink and write? 
  [Leotard] Naturally, wouldn't you like that yourself? 
  [Giesbert] The conference on science and defense, in which 
Europe No. 1 is participating, starts today. Would you like to 
make soldiers who are listening to us this morning dream by 
describing some of these gadgets which are being designed by the 
army -- such as high-powered microwave weapons to jam hostile 
electronic systems? 
  [Leotard] As you probably know, we will celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of the Liberation. Four years ago it was the 50th 
anniversary of the defeat -- France's defeat by the Nazis. We 
lost in 1940 because we did not have the same weapons as others. 
It was because we were not ready for the invasion, for the war. 
I believe that my role, like that of my predecessors and that 
of my followers, is to give the Armed Forces the means they need 
or the means they will need. One could smile or be worried when 
hearing about this new equipment. My role is to make sure that 
the Armed Forces have the necessary weapons for all possible 
contingencies. I believe that the French people must know that 
as far as technological knowledge in this field is concerned, we 
are the best in Europe. This represents a lot of know-how, 
top-class scientists, superior research centers, and the will 
not to wage war. This is a will to defend the country, to defend 
certain values, to be present in the world, but we will not 
attack anyone. 
  [Giesbert] Are we defending peace through force, as [French 
writer] Romain Rolland said? 
  [Leotard] Absolutely! 
  [Giesbert] Francois Mitterrand announced on 10 May that 
nuclear tests will not be resumed and the right-wing majority in 
parliament expressed outrage. Let us try to consider this issue 
in detail. The first point is that experts are apparently 
divided on whether or not to suspend tests before computer tests 
are possible. 
  [Leotard] In fact, France must obtain as rapidly as possible 
-- but this will take several years, possibly seven, eight or 10 
years -- the ability to simulate [tests], that is, the 
possibility to study the effects of a nuclear explosion in a 
laboratory. This is essential for our country if it wants to 
remain a great power. To achieve this the scientists, all the 
scientists, are telling us -- as it is their responsibility to 
do so -- that we must be able to carry out some tests to 
experiment. 
  [Giesbert] You are saying all the scientists; some say some 
scientists. 
  [Leotard] I have not once met a single scientist saying the 
opposite. Not once, not a single scientist. 
  [Giesbert] Are those who disagree not scientists? 
  [Leotard] Generally speaking, they are politicians. This is 
different. On the whole, French scientists say that to secure 
this capacity we need some tests. I believe that we must 
remember what the history of this venture has been since 1960. 
General de Gaulle developed the French nuclear deterrent against 
a general opposition. Therefore, I believe we must continue on 
this path. 
  [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, if all other countries halt nuclear 
testing do you seriously believe that France will be able to run 
counter to the international community for long? This will seem 
rather strange. 
  [Leotard] Not everyone has stopped testing. As you know, 
since the moratorium was declared, China has continued. Other 
countries have obtained this capacity of simulating explosions 
before us and did so better than we did. I believe that France 
should not allow itself to be left behind otherwise it will lose 
part of its independence and of its defense capabilities. 
  [Giesbert] Let us now consider European issues. By laying 
the foundations of a Franco-German army, Helmut Kohl and 
Francois Mitterrand took a real political risk. They laid the 
foundations of a European defense policy and we have the feeling 
that this is moving much slower under a [French] right-wing 
majority. 
  [Leotard] I do not believe that this can be said. As you may 
have seen in the [defense] white paper, we expressed a deep 
European conviction. 
  [Giesbert] We are still waiting for the decisions. 
  [Leotard] They have been made. You just need to consider the 
expansion of the Eurocorps. 
  [Giesbert] These were often decisions made by Francois 
Mitterrand or by Socialist governments. 
  [Leotard] Don't say that. It is not true. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, concerning Bosnia, last year you 
were 
ready to take things to the bitter end. Today you are, let us 
say, more realistic. What is behind this U-turn? The 
government, the ministry, the military? 
  [Leotard] No. I always said that air strikes should have 
been carried out when there were no UN soldiers on the ground. 
This was before the summer of 1992. As soon as UN soldiers 
were deployed on the ground the basic responsible attitude was 
to avoid endangering their lives unnecessarily. That is all. I 
never changed my mind on this issue. I believe that we must be 
very firm on this new doctrine which is currently perverting 
Europe, namely ethnic cleansing. 
  [Giesbert] Do you really believe that France will carry out 
its threat to pull out its forces from the former Yugoslavia? 
  [Leotard] I always said, and I repeat, that no one is being 
forced to do absurd things. I would like you to know that we 
have begun the process of withdrawing of a certain number of 
battalions that we have there. First, the one in Glina, in 
Krajina, and then the one in Bihac. Before the end of the year, 
there will be about 2,500 fewer French soldiers on the territory 
of the former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] Speculation on possible successors to 
European Union (EU) Commission President Jacques Delors has 
begun to appear in the French press. 
  Philippe Lemaitre, LE MONDE correspondent in Brussels, 
writes 
in the 30 April edition of that Paris daily that attention is 
focused on Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commission vice 
president in charge of foreign economic relations, Ruud Lubbers, 
the Netherlands prime minister, and Jean-Luc Dehaene, his 
Belgian counterpart. Brittan, while "brilliant and 
efficient...has little support in France," Lemaitre contends. 
Brittan succeeded during the GATT negotiations in not 
antagonizing the French. However, the suspicion of partiality 
that resulted from some of his positions--notably his refusal to 
allow the French Aerospatiale firm to purchase the Canadian De 
Havilland company--still lingers. Brittan's concept of Europe 
does not dovetail with France's, Lemaitre continues, citing an 
observer as saying that "for Brittan, the Union is merely a 
free-trade zone with a single currency." This approach may prove 
untenable, as the next president's most important task may well 
be the 1996 intergovernmental conference aimed at the political 
integration of Europe. 
  As for Ruud Lubbers, Lemaitre notes, he was long considered 
the "obvious" candidate, benefiting from the support of 
"socialist heavyweights" Delors and Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish 
prime minister. A federalist, Lubbers might achieve the needed 
balance in a Union threatened by division. However, Germany did 
not appreciate his "reticence" at the time of German 
unification, and both President Francois Mitterrand and 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl were reportedly "irked" by Lubbers' 
"tolerance" of British Prime Minister John Major's demands 
during the Maastricht negotiations. If repeated, this stance 
could "paralyze" the 1996 political-institutional debate, 
Lemaitre contends. However, Lubbers' chances are good, 
especially if the British, convinced that a Brittan candidacy 
could not succeed, grant him their support. 
  Both France and Germany, Lemaitre continues, would prefer 
Jean-Luc Dehaene, whose behavior is unanimously praised. A 
"well-mannered Christian Democrat," Dehaene is appreciated in 
Paris for his knowledge of the issues and the directness with 
which he would conduct--"more fluently in French than in 
English"--the efforts necessary to achieve progress in European 
construction. According to Lemaitre, the impression is that 
Dehaene would defend political union "without dogmatism but with 
determination." Dehaene, Lemaitre contends, represents a 
"familiar and reassuring Europe" at a time of impending 
enlargement. He would not meet with total British opposition, 
even if Paris and Bonn "are banking on his resoluteness to 
counter, if necessary, London's penchant for a European space 
without political consistency." 
  If the constraints of Belgian domestic politics were to 
block 
Dehaene's candidacy, an "outsider" like Etienne Davignon, 
president of the Societe Generale de Belgique and a former 
commissioner of proven efficiency, might be considered a 
"perfectably acceptable Belgian alternative," Lemaitre writes. 
Another candidate may be Peter Sutherland, the Irishman 
recently appointed secretary general of the GATT. France's 
desire to preserve intact its place in the next Commission might 
not be easy, given Delors' long presidency. 
  The French tradition mandating the appointment of one 
commissioner from the ranks of the governing majority and 
another from the opposition will probably be maintained, 
Lemaitre predicts. A possible French "ticket" composed of former 
Prime Minister Edith Cresson--who would enjoy Mitterrand's 
support--and Rally for the Republic (RPR) deputy Jean-Bernard 
Raymond would illustrate the government's wish to send to 
Brussels political figures rather than "distrusted technocrats." 
On the Left, other candidates might be former European Affairs 
Minister Elisabeth Guigou and former Agriculture Minister Henri 
Nallet. On the Right, Balladur's adviser on European affairs, 
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, whose talent is generally acknowledged, 
is sometimes mentioned despite his lack of political experience. 
Another possible candidate mentioned is Eurodeputy Jean-Louis 
Bourlanges, "one of the few French Europarliamentarians to have 
succeeded in escaping anonymity," Lemaitre concludes. 
  Marie-Martine Buckens also discusses the succession in the 
30 
April Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN. While her report essentially 
agrees with Lemaitre's, she adds that the fact Sir Leon Brittan 
is British presents a "double disadvantage." First, he belongs 
to a "big" country, and tradition mandates that the next 
president ought to come from a "small" country. Second, Brittan 
must convince his partners of his "loyalty" on social policy and 
monetary union, two priority issues from which Great Britain has 
distanced itself. As for Jean-Luc Dehaene, Buckens comments 
that he is reportedly the favorite of the "Franco-German axis," 
a factor of "decisive" importance. Fulfilling the "small" 
country condition, Dehaene, endowed with "a gift of compromise, 
pragmatism, and directness," deserved his partners' unanimous 
praise for the way the 1993 Belgian EU presidency was conducted.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "U.S. Inconsistencies"] </F>
  [Text] Is there such a thing as a U.S. policy on Bosnia? 
Judging from the Geneva meeting on Friday, 13 May, the answer 
can only be negative. While the United States agreed to the 
approach advocated by the Europeans with respect to the Bosnian 
crisis, it was once more with plenty of reservations and 
unresolved contradictions. 
  One may say that, since World War II, Europe has never 
appealed so forcefully to the United States. And never has it 
had to deplore such a noncommittal and inconsistent policy by 
the United States. 
  Behind the contrived consensus arrived at in Geneva there 
remain two different approaches to the Bosnian crisis, which 
boil down to a clash between America's moralism and Europe's 
realism. For the United States, there is no question of 
imposing on Bosnia's Muslims a settlement that they would not 
agree to, as in this war they are the victims. For Europe, what 
matters most is stopping the war, even though there cannot be a 
settlement that does justice to the victims. 
  According to [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, the U.S. 
Administration is now beginning to understand the limits of its 
"moral" arguments and the danger of leaving the belligerents 
free to fight it out to the last instead of intervening 
directly. However, because of domesitc considerations, U.S. 
officials will not say this aloud; while off the record they 
reject the notion of lifting the arms embargo which has been 
requested by the Senate, they do not say so publicly6 and they 
simultaneously issue contradictory statements on the partition 
of Bosnia between the various communities. 
  However, without a clear U.S. stand, Alain Juppe's already 
fragile "realistic" line collapses: Judging from what has been 
going on in the field, one can clearly see that the belligerents 
will opt for peace only if they feel the international community 
is ready to force it on them. While in the last few weeks the 
Serbs could appreciate the limits of Western threats regarding 
air strikes, Bosnia's Muslims will have noted how unconvincingly 
the United States called upon them to lay down their arms. 
  The Europeans did no better than the United States on the 
outset of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. And both the 
Europeans and the United States are still paying for those 
initial errors inasmuch as they cannot control the crisis. In 
this respect, things are unlikely to change as a result of this 
latest episode in Geneva.

  [Excerpts] The finance minister [Eduardo Catroga] has said 
that it was unclear why Banco Totta sold capital to the Spanish 
bank Banesto. This was because Banesto owned, directly or 
indirectly, about half of Totta's shares, although the law only 
allows 25-percent ownership. The minister admits that the law 
was broken, and he is informing the attorney general's office of 
this matter. Eduardo Catroga was speaking in Brussels, where he 
went to discuss the latest European Commission forecasts for the 
Portuguese economy. [passage omitted] Pedro Oliveira reports. 
  [Oliveira] For Minister Catroga, the recovery of the 
Portuguese economy is under way, following in the footsteps of 
the rest of the European Union [EU]. The resumption of growth, 
budget control, wage moderation, and control of inflation -- 
Catroga brought to Brussels positive indicators regarding the 
Portuguese economy. [passage omitted] 
  [Catroga] "The recovery of the Portuguese economy has 
started. That recovery will be gradual during 1994 -- it is a 
long and difficult process that will be consolidated in 1995." 
  [Oliveira] A 3-percent growth in 1995, with the help of EU 
funds, but only 1.1 percent for the current year -- half a point 
below the EU's average. Catroga admitted that this objective 
would not be reached this year. 
  [Catroga] "The Portuguese Government's objective -- 
according 
to the macroeconomic scene underlying the state budget for 1994 
-- was a growth in gross domestic product of between 1 and 2 
percent. The commission's estimate lies in this range. It is 
also an objective of the Portuguese Government to obtain an 
average growth higher than the average EU growth. This 
objective has to be seen on a medium- to long-term basis. It 
does not mean though that in a particular year, in our view, 
this rule -- which must be valid on a medium- to long-term basis 
and which must remain our goal -- it does not mean that there 
will be no fluctuation in a particular year. Especially in a 
year following a period of recession and enjoying the beginnings 
of an economic recovery such as 1994." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Military chiefs will be appointed exclusively by 
politicians. The Council of Ministers today approved a bill, to 
be submitted to parliament, giving the government and the 
president of the Republic the power to appoint military chiefs. 
Lists of names chosen by the top brass of the three branches of 
the Armed Forces will disappear. The Ministry of Defense will 
make its choices and the president will sign the nominations.

<F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen: "The Third </F>
Path"] 
  [Text] The bartender is a schoolteacher by day. His wife 
works part-time in the same restaurant as a waitress. She also 
has three other jobs. 
  This is an everyday situation in the United States, as 
described by one U.S. newspaper. It is certainly not an unusual 
situation. In round figures one in three employees in the United 
States is considered a part-time or casual worker with a limited 
contract of employment. By the year 2000 it is expected that 
more than half the work force will find itself in this situation. 
  The problem is not part-time work in itself. The problem is 
that part-time and casual work is part of the trend in the 
United States where employees' rights are rapidly being 
undermined. Employers do not need to pay health insurance or 
pension contributions for those who are employed on these terms. 
They can fire workers as they please, without any notice. And 
extremely low wages often go hand in hand with this absence of 
rights. 
  The United States has created a good 2 million jobs over the 
past 14 months. But many of these jobs are well below the 
standard that we in Denmark and Europe associate with proper 
work. 
  The Americans work with the concept: "the working poor." 
This refers to the many people in the United States who, it is 
true, have been given work but at a wage under the poverty line. 
More than half of the over 30 million Americans who live below 
the official poverty line are a member of families in which at 
least one person is employed. 
  President Clinton and Labor Secretary Robert Reich have set 
themselves the task of changing this situation. Reich stated 
recently: 
  "The question presents itself whether the advanced economies 
are condemned to choose between more jobs with lower wages or 
fewer jobs with good wages. I hope and believe that the answer 
is no." 
  I agree: The answer is no. There is a third way between 
more jobs with low wages or fewer jobs with good wages. A way 
that is founded on creating proper jobs. This way will be 
strengthened with the Nordic countries and Austria as members of 
the European Union [EU]. And it will continue to be followed 
when the countries of East Europe join. 
  In the past few years the EU countries have concerned 
themselves most with staking out this third way on the basis of 
the European welfare tradition. The Danish Government has been 
one of the driving forces in this work. 
  We have to admit that over the past 20 years Europe has been 
much worse at creating new jobs than both the United States and 
Japan. But we must not combat unemployment by creating social 
gulfs that are completely unacceptable in our societies. 
  The discussion of this problem was at the center of the EC 
summit in Copenhagen last year. It was stressed that much more 
can be done to promote employment if the countries make a 
concerted effort to get their economies going. In addition, the 
EC Commission was asked to draft a white book with the title, 
"Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment." 
  On some central points the EU's initiative is in line with 
the Danish Government's policy. 
  The European point of departure is that it is not low wages 
and poor working conditions that will strengthen our economies 
in international competition. Under no circumstances can we 
compete in these areas with the Southeast Asian and East 
European countries, for example. 
  Our economic future depends first and foremost on whether 
we are able to make our labor forces good enough, whether we are 
creative enough in the development of new products, and whether 
we are in the lead in the use of high technology. 
  The EU is preparing the way for major public investment 
projects in two areas that are very central to our economic 
development. One is energy and transport. The other is 
telecommunications. 
  The Danish Government has to a large extent persuaded the 
other EU countries to attach great importance to restructuring 
their taxation systems. Taxes on labor must be reduced, and on 
the other hand taxes on pollution and resource use must be 
increased. This makes it easier for companies to employ people, 
but punishes us all for the ruthless exploitation of natural 
resources. 
  The EU countries are well aware that there is a need for a 
drastic increase in investment in education, research, and 
product development in the field of high technology where Europe 
is clearly lagging behind both Japan and the United States. 
  An important part of European thinking is the better 
distribution of work. Here too we in Denmark have been in the 
vanguard with the visionary leave reform that has been 
introduced. 
  Even though the EU has backed a number of sensible joint 
approaches, it is clear that the EU countries are unable to 
agree on everything. Some nonsocialist governments -- headed by 
the British Conservatives -- would have liked to have given 
prominence to other aspects that have more in common with the 
pre-Clinton United States. They advocate lower unemployment 
benefits, a reduction in the wages of those with low earnings, 
and cuts in social benefits, for example. 
  In its white book the EU Commission also mentions these 
views. But it also issues a warning against repeating the U.S. 
trend -- a warning that both Jacques Delors and I myself have 
voiced in the European debate. The white book says, among other 
things: 
  "In particular, a greater downward wage spread would lead to 
a significant real-term fall in the lowest wages. This would be 
impossible without a reduction in unemployment benefit and 
social insurance arrangements. In combination with an increase 
in the use of part-time employees it would also, all things 
being equal, make the present distribution of income more 
unequal and at worst create a poverty group who cannot live 
decently on their wages and therefore lead to a form of 
exclusion that is just as destructive as unemployment." 
  Social democratic and nonsocialist attitudes to unemployment 
are at odds in Europe, as they are in Denmark. 
  The social democratic parties in Europe have jointly drafted 
an important initiative for a European employment policy. This 
initiative, which has the title "Put Europe to Work," is a 
program for what I have called the third way in the battle 
against unemployment. 
  Here in Denmark nonsocialist politicians have voiced views 
that are the same as those coming from conservative forces in 
Europe. 
  Liberal Party deputy chairman Anders Fogh Rasmussen said 
recently that the United States is the country that comes 
closest to his ideal of a liberalistic society. The 
Conservatives' leader, Hans Engell, has argued in a somewhat 
toned-down version that we should look at U.S. methods of 
boosting employment. 
  Attitudes to what should happen to the welfare state in 
Denmark and Europe are inextricably linked. We will work for 
the third way in Denmark and in Europe. That is why it is so 
important to elect a large number of social democrats to the 
European Parliament.

  [Text] In the opinion of President Martti Ahtisaari, the 
expansion of the European Union [EU] is important from the 
viewpoint of security policy. Addressing the annual meeting of 
the Civil Defense Course Association, Ahtisaari said that the 
expansion of the EU is the most important factor for the 
consolidation of European stability and a vital process for 
joint security. According to Ahtisaari, EU membership creates a 
new kind of action framework for Finland in foreign and security 
policy when it is a member of the chief group influencing 
international politics. Ahtisaari said that he expected much 
from the civic debate preceding the EU referendum, adding that 
the Finns must make it clear to themselves and others in which 
direction they want to take this country.

<F P=106> [Article by Birgitta Jernvall Ingman: "Food Industry </F>
Satisfied With EU Agreement"] 
  [Text] Mining counselor Bjorn Mattsson, the chairman of the 
food industry, is more or less satisfied with the European Union 
[EU] agreement that was reached yesterday. 
  "My opinion is that the agreement as a whole gives Finland 
possibilities for development," he says, at the same time as he 
points out that, as in all agreements, there are compromises 
involved. 
  In addition to all the principles, it is a matter of a 
fierce 
struggle for jobs, as to which countries attract industrial 
activity, he concludes. 
  Now he only hopes that it will be possible to avoid a long 
political quarrel about the domestic part, something that would 
only prolong industry's period of uncertainty. Mattsson 
therefore rejects Member of Parliament Paavo Vayrynen's proposal 
to postpone the EU membership. 
  "That does not improve anything. I am of the opinion that 
our 
EU negotiations have been handled well. Always, when you 
approach the end, the whole must have precedence over the parts." 
  Mattsson describes the EU agreement as acceptable for his 
own 
company, Cultor AB, as well, despite the fact that the lowered 
sugar quota was a blow. 
<H5>  Lower Volume Threatens Sugar Refineries </H5>
  From Cultor's point of view, Finland's sugar quota was one 
of 
the three important parts of the EU agreements. The decrease of 
about 10,000 tons from 144,000 plus 14,000 tons to 133,000 plus 
13,000 destroys the previous adjustment regarding productivity 
and margins and threatens the existence of one of the group's 
three sugar refineries. It is said that 10,000 tons of sugar is 
the equivalent of about 100,000 sugar beets and a cultivated 
area of about 2,500 hectares. 
  "Now the question is how, with a lower volume, it will be 
possible to achieve the previous productivity," says Mattsson. 
  The other two important parts of the EU agreements concern 
grain production in Finland and Sweden and the export of fish 
from Norway to Europe. 
  What Norway achieved in the matter of fishing means that 
Cultor's fodder production in that sector can continue as 
before, at the same time as EU provides greater stability. 
  The grain production in Finland and Sweden also gives the 
company's fodder production reasonable opportunities, 
particularly since one has to come down to European grain prices 
right away. But one precondition for a promising fodder industry 
is that the meat and dairy sector maintain their positions, the 
head of Cultor states. 
  Part of the domestic adjustment is to decide on how to 
handle 
inventories of raw materials bought before joining the EU. Here 
the government's grain inventory is the central matter -- but it 
is obvious that all companies are now striving to minimize their 
inventories and plan them in detail. 
  One problem is that the EU does not know about such a thing 
as the primary product subsidy that Finland now has, which 
reduces the consumer price for meat and milk, for example. In 
order to compensate for that loss, the value-added tax on food 
must be lowered to 10 percent in this phase. In 1997 the 
value-added tax on food in the EU must be coordinated at 5 
percent. 
<H5>  Certain Demands Met -- Others Not </H5>
  On behalf of the entire food industry, Mattsson states that 
a 
part of the demands were granted, but for milk, meat, and 
vegetables, for example, one did not get the period of 
adjustment that had been sought. 
  Now it is important for people at the company level to 
review 
their possibilities. 
  In any case, Mattsson points out that in the EU there is 
money that, supplemented by domestic support, can be granted to 
the food industry for adjustment to the new market situation. 
Harsh conditions are tied to the subsidy, that, among other 
things, must not distort competition. 
  The authorities will first make an industry evaluation and 
then distribute the subsidies, both the one from the EU and the 
domestic one. In one and the same industry there might be 
companies that need support and those that do not. 
  "I want to call this a type of debt reorganization; it must 
be a serious matter for the company," Mattsson says. 
  Cultor will not apply for any subsidy. The company has long 
prepared itself for the agreement that was completed yesterday, 
the concentration on core areas has been achieved, and the 
productivity is in order. "Our productivity is at the European 
level and our goal is to manage by ourselves," says Mattsson. 
<H5>  Labor Conflict Frustrating </H5>
  Mattsson today regards as much more serious than the EU 
agreement the labor conflict that the food industry has just 
suffered through, "in a situation where a part of our industry 
was fighting for its life," as he expresses it. 
  "Wage demands were put forward that were twice as high as 
within the export industry, in a situation where the parties had 
a common view of the declining employment capability in the food 
industry, and they were aware that we are facing a painful 
structural change," Mattsson says. 
  He wonders whether one could call the system of negotiation 
bankrupt, that one negotiated for months in order then to reject 
both the national arbitrator's and the arbitration commission's 
unanimous proposals. 
  According to the chairman of the food industry, working 
conditions will now have to be accomplished such that the 
employees feel loyalty toward their companies, which then also 
increase their influence. The other, and worse alternative, 
according to Mattsson, is a system similar to the one in Norway, 
with forced arbitration of some sort. 
  "We felt frustrated over the situation that occurred," says 
Mattsson. 
  What he is now hoping for is genuine cooperation.

  [Text] Repairs on the second unit of the Loviisa nuclear 
power station [on the Finnish south coast] are expected to take 
four days. It was decided to shut down the second unit of the 
nuclear power station when a leak was discovered in the 
reactor's cooling circuit. Slightly radioactive evaporating 
water is dripping through the cooling circuit's valve casing. 
The valve cannot be separated and repaired while the power 
station is running so the unit will be frozen for the duration 
of repairs on the valve. The leak was discovered in the early 
hours of this morning when the station's operators noticed that 
the insulation in the valve casing had become moist. The Center 
for Radiation and Nuclear Safety was informed of the fault in 
the morning. The reason for the leak is not known.

  [Text] The export of defense materiel will always need an 
export license even in the future, but it can be granted by the 
Ministry of Defense instead of by the government, which is now 
the primary licensing authority. This is the opinion of a 
working group at the Ministry of Defense that has studied the 
need for reforming the arms export legislation, particularly in 
view of the European Union. The group submitted its memorandum 
to Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn on Wednesday [20 April]. 
  If required for reasons of foreign or security policy, the 
license could also in the future be issued by the government, 
says the working group. The working group included 
representatives of the Ministries of Defense, Foreign Affairs, 
Trade and Industry, as well as the Interior Ministry and the 
General Staff.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Training of Estonian Policemen </F>
Useful for Finland as Well"] 
  [Text] The training of Estonian policemen in Finland has 
gotten under way. In early spring the Police Institute in Espoo 
already had a few Estonian policemen for a brief course. At the 
Police School in Tampere a crime investigation course, in which 
Estonian investigators participate for the first time, is 
currently under way. 
  The police department of Finland's Ministry of the Interior 
and the head of Estonia's police have agreed on intensified 
cooperation in training. This year about 30 Estonian policemen 
will take courses in Finland. 
  Chief Inspector Matti Launiainen of the Interior Ministry's 
police department says that the training of Estonian policemen 
also gets the Finnish policemen used to international relations. 
Finland also benefits from the Estonian policemen by acquiring 
current information about crime in the east. 
  The first experience from the training cooperation is good. 
The language represents the biggest problem, but it is not 
insurmountable. The training language is Finnish. 
  Criminal investigator Ain Balder from Tartu says that 
economic criminals in Estonia have a five-year lead over the 
police. This lead is what one is now trying to shorten with the 
training in Finland. 
  The strong moral self-esteem of the Finnish police appeals 
to 
the Estonian policemen, says Balder. In Estonia there are 
problems of suspicion about receiving bribes. This is ballast 
from the Soviet era that one should get rid of, he says. 
  Balder believes that personal contacts across the Bay of 
Finland will make criminal investigation in both countries more 
efficient. It is surely better to get help through direct 
contacts than via Interpol or other official international 
channels, he says.

<F P=106> [Interview with Labor Party Chairman Thorbjorn Jagland by </F>
Oyvind Johnsen; place and date not given: "We Can Govern as Part 
of EU"] 
  [Text] The economic and monetary union with the EC will 
give the government greater possibilities for control. A united 
European social democracy has a different view of the Maastricht 
treaty from that of the Social Democrats Against the European 
Union (SME), according to the Labor Party leader Thorbjorn 
Jagland in this interview with ARBEIDERBLADET. 
  The fight over Norwegian membership in the European Union 
[EU] is in full swing. Many think it will be decided by the 
labor movement. Within the Labor Party there are broad 
differences in the point of view of the party leadership and the 
Social Democrats against the EU, where Hallvard Bakke is a 
well-known figure. 
  VG [VERDENS GANG] hinted last week that the Labor Party's 
patience with SME soon ought to be over. Jagland disagrees with 
the advice: "The nonsocialists are asking with increasing 
loudness when my patience with the SME will be at an end -- in 
the hope that it will come to an end.... They hope that this 
matter will create problems for us by dividing us. 
  ``However, there is no end to my patience. We have to live 
with this kind of tension; it is part of life. We are going 
through a dramatic transition period, and it would be artificial 
if we were in total agreement on these questions. It would be 
strange if it was not difficult for the Labor Party to accept 
Bakke's point of view. On the other hand, it is strange that 
there are no people visibly in favor of the EU in the SV 
[Socialist Left Party], and that is their problem right now.'' 
<H5>  Thinks Alike </H5>
  [Jagland] When it comes right down to it, the difference 
between me and Bakke is not so great. We think alike in many 
ways. 
  [Johnsen] In other words, Bakke will be a good man to bring 
into the EU? 
  [Jagland] Yes, it will be good to have Hallvard with us 
because of his critical view of the conservatives' way of 
dealing with unemployment issues. 
  [Johnsen] Do you think the SME should have unlimited freedom 
in the Storting group also? 
  [Jagland] With respect to the referendum and our work in the 
time prior to that, we need complete freedom. However, in the 
Storting group normal rules of play must be in effect. In the 
Storting chamber there is the usual party discipline; that 
question has been decided. Moreover, we do not view the SME as a 
part of the party organization, but as a "no" organization in 
which party members participate. Within the party there is 
nothing called the SME. 
<H5>  Different View </H5>
  [Johnsen] SME thinks that the EU embodies a liberal market 
policy. How can you advocate membership in the EU if this is 
correct? 
  [Jagland] As far as I understand, the SME thinks that it is 
the objectives of the Maastricht treaty concerning a low 
increase in prices, reduced budget deficits, and the foreign 
exchange policy that will prevent us from carrying out an active 
employment strategy. The united social democrats in West Europe 
hold a totally different view in this matter from that of the 
SME. We think that those objectives are a precondition for 
having a more active employment policy. 
  We cannot solve employment problems by promoting growth 
driven by inflation. Demand-driven growth is a classic example 
of private demand being inflated in order to increase 
employment. This period in our history is over. It is contrary 
to any sensible environmental policies. 
  On the contrary, we should promote growth driven by 
investments; growth resulting from goal-oriented focusing on 
objectives that will create jobs while at the same time 
improving the environment. Just think of the enormous amounts of 
money the EU is currently investing in improvements of the 
energy network in Europe. This will create growth and jobs, 
while at the same time improving the environment because energy 
will be used more effectively. 
<H5>  As in Norway </H5>
  [Jagland] As far as the budget deficit is concerned, the 
Maastricht treaty subscribes to more or less the same policy we 
have had in Norway that aims to reduce the deficit in 
combination with actively focusing on promoting employment. We 
have to squeeze the government money out of entitlements and 
into active employment initiatives. 
  But if we have gotten no further than thinking that the rich 
countries in the world should continue to finance their own 
welfare by more and more borrowing, we really are in a crisis 
situation. It is a fact that when we have these big budget 
deficits we borrow for our own welfare. If our goal is not for 
the rich countries to finance their own budgets, at least we 
should quit talking about the environment and about solidarity 
with the poor countries. In that case what we have is pure 
egoism; egoism that involves continued borrowing by the rich 
countries to the detriment of the poor. 
<H5>  Short-Term Thinking </H5>
  [Jagland] As to the third item, foreign exchange policy, the 
SME talks about us relinquishing our right to devalue our 
currency. However, what happened in the 1980's showed what the 
result of fluctuations in the exchange rates led to. It resulted 
in all decisions, whether taken by business leaders or 
politicians, being based on short-term considerations. Nothing 
was being considered besides the exchange rates on the following 
day, and the fact that all decisions were based on short-term 
considerations was one of the main reasons why unemployment grew. 
  And nothing can be more capitalistic and market oriented 
than 
watching the exchange rates and then raking in the profits from 
that. 
<H5>  New Liberalism </H5>
  [Johnsen] What you are saying now in fact, is that the SME 
arguments concerning a more relaxed attitude toward inflation, 
deficit, and exchange rates in reality is more typical of 
market-driven liberalism than the Maastricht treaty? 
  [Jagland] Yes, in my opinion that is just what it is. First, 
one is talking about an old-fashioned policy of growth; with 
demand that ruins the environment without solving unemployment 
problems. And at the same time one allows currency speculators 
to run a good part of the world's economy. 
  If one quits using slogans, one will see that market 
liberalism gained a foothold for two reasons. One was the fact 
that foreign exchange rates began fluctuating, the other that 
movement of capital was freed up. These two things taken 
together are what we in a nutshell call neoliberalism. If we 
want to get rid of neoliberalism we shall have to deal with both 
these things. 
<H5>  Not Radical </H5>
  [Johnsen] But the SME's point of view is uniting many among 
the Labor Party extremists. How does this fit in with what you 
are saying about liberalism? 
  [Jagland] You must ask the SME about what is so radical 
about 
having a high rate of inflation with ensuing high interest 
rates, and a high deficit that undermines the national economy 
while at the same time strengthening the private economy. If one 
wants government control, one must talk on this level and try to 
create stability. Only then one will be able to govern. 
  I will also mention how we were able to govern during the 
period we often call the golden age of social democracy, which 
covers the period from just after the war up through the 1970's. 
We call this the golden age mainly because we had progress every 
year. The government had much direct control, but the main 
reason was that it was possible to plan for the long run. Einar 
Gerhardsen [Norwegian prime minister] knew what the krone was 
worth year by year, inflation was 2-3 percent and interest rates 
were correspondingly low. Then both the government and business 
could plan for the long run. That is how we had stability, and 
that was called control. 
  We must return to such stable conditions. We are trying to 
do 
this through the Maastricht treaty's economic and monetary 
union. We adhere to the fact that stable prices and the 
attendant low interest rates are necessary -- and this will lead 
to a smaller deficit. 
<H5>  Common Interests </H5>
  [Johnsen] You say that in reality the Maastricht treaty has 
more room for the social democracy's policy of control than for 
liberal policies? 
  [Jagland] That is my clear understanding. But the union is a 
framework that all responsible powers can use. In today's Europe 
the labor movement and industrial capitalists have common 
interests directed against speculators who constitute a threat 
against both parties. One has tried to unite these common 
interest groups in the treaty. Those are the groups with broad, 
social interests, those who think long-term, and who are not 
just considering short-term profit. 
<H5>  Misunderstanding </H5>
  [Johnsen] The SME maintains that the EU has decided to let 
market forces solve the problems connected with unemployment. Is 
this correct, and how does this agree with your view of the EU? 
  [Jagland] No, that is a fundamental misunderstanding. In 
this 
case policies carried out by each individual country have been 
confused with what the EU stands for. When looking at the 
actions of the EU, there have been several attempts on the part 
of the European Commission to achieve a more active employment 
strategy. Jacques Delors has proposed a massive increase in the 
EU's budget with a view to increasing investments and 
initiatives that would lower unemployment. But this has met with 
no response from the conservative governments in West Europe. 
  In other words one must determine what is what. One item is 
the employment policy of the conservative governments. Another 
item is the white paper from the commission, which was an 
important step in the right direction. It did not include 
everything and we disagreed with some of it. But it did include 
much of the program submitted by the social democrats for 
putting Europe to work again. The white paper was diluted by the 
EU's ministers of finance, and we are dissatisfied with the 
result, but that too is a step in the right direction. 
<H5>  Friedman's Thoughts </H5>
  [Johnsen] What about the SME's contention that unemployment 
was caused to a great extent by the EU's anti-inflationary 
policy? 
  [Jagland] There are two important reasons why unemployment 
in 
Europe increased. One is the short-term view we talked about. 
The other is because most welfare states maneuver themselves 
into a tight spot because of deficit spending. There was no 
money with which to fight unemployment. The conservative 
governments let things slide. They did not even attempt to 
regain stability by resorting to changing foreign exchange 
policies. 
  Milton Friedman was the most important monetaristic thinker 
and his ideas received priority: Currency rates should float 
completely freely. What also should have been done was to 
actively use public budgets to fight unemployment. Instead, 
budgets were cut back. Unemployment rose and so also the budget 
deficits. 
<H5>  Active Policy </H5>
  [Johnsen] But the Maastricht treaty provides no guidance for 
direct, active measures against unemployment. Can one achieve 
results without that? 
  [Jagland] As social democrats we want active employment 
policies, and we think the Maastricht treaty should have a 
supplementary policy that includes this. In this instance SME 
and we agree. The social democrats agree on the treaty's 
objectives. 
  [Johnsen] Well, the SME is really also against the 
Maastricht 
treaty's objectives.... 
  [Jagland] Yes, but I really do not understand that. The 
treaty's objective is a premise for an active policy against 
unemployment. 
  [Johnsen] How can the social democrats create a more active 
employment policy in the EU when the conservatives are holding 
back? 
  [Jagland] If the Nordic countries join, the picture will be 
different, especially if there is a political change in Germany. 
It is quite possible that there will be a social democratic 
government in Sweden this fall; this is already the case in 
Denmark, and some time in the future, there is a possibility in 
Great Britain also. Even in the short run many things might 
happen. 
  Moreover, it is a misunderstanding to think that the social 
democrats were alone in creating the welfare states in Europe. 
In Europe there is a cultural and historical basis for a broad 
front of social democrats and a nonsocialist center against 
uninhibited capitalism. The social democrats are an important 
factor, but they could not have done the job without help from 
the nonsocialist center. 
<H5>  Restrictive Measures </H5>
  [Johnsen] Speculators constitute a big problem for currency 
stability. What would you do about them? 
  [Jagland] It is possible to implement restrictive measures, 
but one country cannot do it alone. I do not think one can say 
that free movement of capital is here forever. We must see if it 
is possible to initiate restrictive measures on an international 
scale. The best remedy, however, would be to return to the 
situation we had after the war when exchange rates did not 
fluctuate so much. We came close to having a form of common 
exchange. The dollar was set, and everybody tied their exchange 
rate to it. 
<H5>  ECU Is Good </H5>
  [Johnsen] In other words: You think that the controversial 
common currency -- the ECU -- would benefit the states in their 
fight against speculators? 
  [Jagland] Yes, that is my understanding. We have reached a 
historical point when we must ask ourselves if we should not do 
what was done a couple of hundred years ago when it was 
determined that a meter was a meter and a kilogram a kilogram. 
The way it is now, having technology that enables us to transfer 
billions across the borders within a second, we must have some 
bold objectives where foreign exchange is concerned: To decide 
that a krone is a krone. 
  The most important realization today is the fact that the 
amount of capital is so huge and unconstrainable by borders that 
no country can do anything alone. We must coordinate exchange 
rate policies by regions. If the EU creates stability in Europe, 
the EU can also spearhead a movement of recreating a system of 
global stability, which can regain national financial power from 
the speculators.

billion in 15 years. This is a remarkable development in a 
short time," Percy Barnevik said about China. He and three of 
his closest colleagues met with China's President Jiang Zemin on 
Tuesday. 
  Percy Barnevik wants to show that ABB is serious about 
becoming a local enterprise in China. ABB is moving its head 
office for China from Hong Kong to Bejing. 
  ABB will build a 160,000-square-meter technical and 
educational center in downtown Beijing. This is also where the 
new head office will be located. 
  ABB will use China increasingly as an export base, e.g., for 
Chinese engines and components, not only for the markets of 
Pacific Asia but for the whole world. 
  ABB's investments have slowed down to some degree due to 
China's current austerity policy, but Percy Barnevik believes 
that the country has, even with a growth rate of 5, 8, or 12 
percent per year, an enormous demand for the systems and 
products of the companies. 
  "China will need some 30 power plants per year in the 
future," said Barnevik, who hopes that the company will get at 
least one-third of this business. 
<H5>  Long-Term Projects </H5>
  ABB is also interested in investing in the power plants even 
if the payback will only come after 10 years. 
  "There will be losses the first year, less of them in the 
second, the third may yield some revenue, and later on there 
will be a good deal of money," Percy Barnevik explained at a 
news conference. 
  "There is no quick money to be made in China, one has to 
take 
a long-term view of things," he added. 
  ABB is one of the four main sponsors of the China Summit 
Meeting, starting today in Beijing. This meeting is organized 
by the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE [IHT] and the Chinese 
Government's Commission of Economic Reforms (SCRES). 
  Percy Barnevik has used this meeting as a starting point to 
mobilize his forces within the company. The message is the 
same, both internally and externally: ABB is making an all-out 
investment effort in China, the world's greatest economy within 
a few decades. 
  The electrotechnical giant will invest 3 billion Swedish 
kronor [SKr] in the country within the next two years. The IHT 
charged SKr4 million for the participation of ABB's top brass in 
the Summit Meeting and for the opportunity to discuss with 
China's Prime Minister Li Peng and State Councilor Li Tieying. 
  A total of 200 of ABB's most important clients plus 
government officials and deputy ministers will be invited to 
subsequent workshops devoted to the four business segments of 
the group. 
  And during two days there will be lectures, meetings, and 
conferences that aim to gain a better understanding of China 
today and tomorrow, including the possibilities of influencing 
future economic and hopefully ABB's business opportunities. 
  Percy Barnevik will speak on how China's infrastructure 
could 
be developed. Other speakers from abroad include Mahathir, the 
prime minister of Malaysia, and Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of 
modern Singapore.

  [Text] In an interview with the Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation, Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said that 
after the Turkish side refused to cooperate on the 
confidence-building measures, the Cypriot Government began 
preparing an action plan to deal with the Cyprus issue. This 
plan is expected to be submitted after the UN secretary general 
submits his report to the Security Council. 
  Mikhailidhis said that expert legal advice was sought in the 
preparation of this report. He added that apart from the ideas 
that are already included in it, the action plan should be 
completed in a substantive manner and should include issues that 
will arise after Butrus-Ghali submits his report. 
  The foreign minister emphasized that the Greek Cypriot 
side's 
position stresses that the Security Council must examine ways to 
change the current unacceptable status quo and create 
prerequisites for a substantive dialogue.

  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will submit 
his report to the Security Council by the end of the week to 
give Turkey a chance to clarify some points raised in the Vienna 
talks last week. The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation 
correspondent reported from New York that the extension given to 
the Turkish side expires tomorrow [17 May], when pseudo Prime 
Minister Haki Atun returns to the occupied areas from Ankara. 
Turkey is expected to clarify some points of the 21 March UN 
document, which, according to the Turkish side, has been 
modified. 
  U.S. officials said the Turkish explanations constitute no 
dramatic development or new proposals. Asked whether the Greek 
side will accept them, the same officials said they do not 
intend to suggest something that will not bear fruit. 
Discussing access to Famagusta, the U.S. officials said there 
will be no Turkish troops or armed Turkish Cypriots near the 
road linking the free areas with the fenced-off area. 
  A UN official denied reports that the procedure will be 
suspended for two months, stressing that a negative report will 
be issued if there is a negative Turkish reply. Referring to 
the adoption of alternative ways to implement the UN 
resolutions, a Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent 
reported that there is a shift in views at the UN Security 
Council, something that may delay a decision until 15 June, when 
UNFICYP's [UN Forces in Cyprus] mandate is expected to be 
renewed.

  [Text] Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
alternate special representative, met President Glavkos 
Kliridhis this morning. The purpose of the 45-minute meeting 
was to brief Kliridhis on the Vienna talks at which the United 
Nations gave clarifications to the Turkish side. 
  Answering questions afterward, Feissel said he had prepared 
his report to the secretary general but avoided saying whether 
he had already submitted it. Asked if the report contains any 
ambiguities, Feissel said he does not usually repeat himself. He 
added, however, that the content of the report to be submitted 
to the Security Council is up to the secretary general, just as 
the decision is up to the Security Council. 
  Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said after the meeting 
that from the briefing it followed that there is no prospect for 
a change in the Turkish stance and that the UN efforts for the 
confidence-building measures have failed.

  [Text] The government spokesman said the process of 
proximity talks on the confidence-building measures has been 
terminated. Asked if the Cypriot Government considers that the 
process to find a Cyprus solution in general through the method 
of talks has also been terminated, Government Spokesman Ioannis 
Kasoulidhis said the methods followed to date have proven that 
there cannot be progress, due to the lack of political will by 
the Turkish side. 
  Kasoulidhis added that what should be done now is for the 
Security Council members to consider alternative ways to promote 
a Cyprus solution. He added: After the UN secretary general's 
report is submitted, the Security Council might give some time 
for consultations to be held among its members in order to agree 
on the alternative methods to be promoted. He also noted that 
these consultations might include the guarantor powers in Cyprus.

  [Text] London, May 16 (CNA)--Cyprus called on Turkey here 
Monday [16 May] to withdraw new regulations on the navigation in 
the Bosporus Straits which fall under the jurisdiction of the 
international law. 
  In an intervention at the 63rd session of the Maritime 
Safety 
Committee in London, Adhamos Adhamidhis, minister of 
communications and works of Cyprus, emphatically stated "Cyprus 
as a major maritime country, fully understands the concerns of 
the international maritime community on this issue." 
  He said Cyprus strongly objected to the Turkish regulations 
for passage of vessels through the Bosporus and the Dardanelles 
Straits adopted earlier this year. 
  The minister said the Cypriot objections were based on 
reasons of both substance and the way Turkey was trying to 
impose these regulations. 
  "We consider that a lot of these rules do not correspond to 
the provisions of the 1936 Montreaux convention on the regime of 
the straits, as well as other international instruments such as 
the 1982 UN convention on the law of the sea, existing practice 
and customary law," he said. 
  Adhamidhis added many articles of the Turkish regulations 
violated the principle of freedom of transit and navigation in 
the straits which was recognised and affirmed in the Monteaux 
convention. 
  He pointed out that if a country, such in the case of 
Turkey, 
"unilaterally decides to change the existing rules then the 
world order, which took the international community so many 
efforts and sacrifices to establish, will be confronted with 
many perils and multilateralism will suffer a fatal blow." 
  The minister said Cyprus had a bitter experience from 
Turkish 
decisions taken according to Turkish law in violation of 
international law and practice. 
  "Further to the illegal and arbitrary embargo on Cyprus 
ships 
to call on Turkish ports, the recent Turkish behaviour regarding 
the collision last March of two Cyprus flag vessels, Nassia and 
Shipbroker, in the Bosporus Straits, is indicative of the 
dangers of placing such matters at the whim of a single 
country," he told the London meeting. 
  Regarding last March's incident, the minister said the 
Cyprus 
government in conformity with the obligations under the solas, 
loadlines and marpol conventions, immediately approached Turkey 
both bilaterally and through the secretary general of IMO 
[International Maritime Organization] for permission to 
investigate the causes of the accident. 
  "Regrettably the Turkish authorities refused our legitimate 
request for access to the ships and the surviving members of the 
crew, some of whom are still in Turkish prisons... in line with 
its ulterior motive, the Turkish administration has deliberately 
and unreasonably prolonged the closure of the straits, on 
account of alleged hazards resulting from the collision of the 
two vessels," Adhadmidhis added. 
  The minister added "Cyprus is of the opinion that if any 
rules for the navigation in the straits are to be considered 
then the IMO's procedures should be adhered to and the justified 
concerns of the states bordering the Black Sea, the landlocked 
ones, whose livelihood mainly depends on the sea-borne trade and 
those who are among the frequent users of the straits should be 
taken into account." 
  Adhamidhis concluded calling on Turkey "to withdraw their 
regulations, which will cause serious damage to the interests of 
the international community and set a bad precedent" and 
appealing for respect of international treaties and legality and 
avoidance of unilateralism. 
  Cyprus has been divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion. 
Turkey continues to occupy 37 per cent of the island's 
territory.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In a statement at the airport 
on his return from a visit to Turkey as the guest of Ankara 
businessmen and industrialists, Prime Minister Hakki Atun said 
he observed that Turkish businessmen and industrialists want to 
invest in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC], given 
the important stage it is in. Atun said his visit reached its 
goal in this respect. 
  The prime minister pointed out that he discussed the work of 
the Turkish Cypriot coalition government during his talks with 
the officials of the Turkish Government and state, and that they 
jointly assessed the latest political situation. He said: I 
was reassured that Turkey will try to continue to extend its 
contributions to the TRNC as before. 
  Atun added that his coalition government will continue to 
fulfill its duties in peace of mind.

  [Text] The United States is considering alternative ways to 
implement the confidence-building measures, not the substance of 
the Cyprus issue. In Vienna, Robert Lamb, the U.S. State 
Department's special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, and 
Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special 
representative on Cyprus, are trying hard to find ways to amend 
the 21 March UN document, with the goal of persuading the Turks 
and Turkish Cypriots to agree to the implementation of the 
confidence-building measures. 
  U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia Richard Boucher said clearly: "We 
will consider alternative ways if the effort to implement the 
confidence-building measures fails." 
  Boucher questioned the 21 March UN document--although the UN 
secretary general and UN Security Council adopted it--and said 
the goal is to reach an agreement on the original 
confidence-building measures package, exactly as Turkish Cypriot 
leader Rauf Denktas wants. 
  The U.S. diplomat reiterated that the United States and the 
United Nations will make every effort to implement the 
confidence-building measures. They are also discussing the 
upcoming report that the UN secretary general will submit to the 
Security Council. 
  Boucher said the effort on the confidence-building measures 
is not dead and added that "if there is another way to implement 
the measures, an effort will be made to find it." 
  Boucher refrained from commenting on the Vienna talks. But, 
according to reliable sources, eight points of the 21 March 
document--identified by Lamb during his talks in Nicosia earlier 
this month--are being discussed. 
  Feissel, representing the United Nations, and two 
representatives of Denktas are participating in the talks. The 
U.S. coordinator and Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Tugay 
Ulucevic attended the talks as "observers." 
  Speaking for the Cypriot Government, Foreign Minister Alekos 
Mikhailidhis stressed that "there are no prospects for progress 
in the Vienna talks."

  [Text] U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia Richard Boucher yesterday 
completely distorted Cyprus' history and downplayed the problem 
regarding issues of economic cooperation between the Republic 
and the pseudostate. 
  Boucher stressed that the Cypriots, both Greek Cypriots and 
Turkish Cypriots, "have a common geography, history, and 
culture," and added that diversity among Cypriots is a unique 
advantage. 
  He called upon the participants to turn Cyprus into a 
regional base for businesses in the radically developing markets 
of Russia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. 
  The U.S. ambassador mentioned that the separate economies on 
the island each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and 
stressed that they would be a lot more effective if they pooled 
their funds, which could help to improve the lives of all 
citizens. 
  Boucher was speaking before 250 people from both communities 
at the fifth annual intercommunal coordinating meeting, 
organized by the UN High Commission for Refugees at the UN 
Headquarters in Nicosia International Airport. 
  An unacceptable incident marred the conclusion of the 
meeting. UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] soldiers refused to allow 
the Greek Cypriot reporters to return to the free areas from 
Nicosia International Airport. The UNFICYP cited the force's 
rules that for security reasons reporters need to leave the area 
accompanied by UNFICYP men. They also tried to confiscate the 
television crews' cameras. 
  Nicosia Mayor Lellos Dhimitriadhis resolved the dispute 
following a heated discussion between the UNFICYP men and the 
Greek Cypriot reporters. He pointed out to the men of the force 
that he was representing the Republic of Cyprus, which hosts the 
United Nations, and assured them that all the Greek Cypriot 
reporters were present at the meeting.

  [Text] [Announcer] Over to the Balkan crisis. The fighting 
continues around the Bosnian city of Tuzla that was attacked 
after the Muslim forces said that they had made territorial 
gains at the Serbs' expense. Meanwhile, diplomatic initiatives 
to end the war continue. The European Union [EU] foreign 
ministers have shown their support for the international plan 
agreed on last week, describing it as the only realistic way to 
end the conflict. From Brussels, here is our correspondent 
Nacho Hernandez. 
  [Hernandez] The EU supports the agreement reached at the 
Geneva meeting on Bosnia-Herzegovina despite its rejection by 
the parties in conflict. The Twelve see the fact that Russia, 
the United States, the United Nations, and the EU have a unified 
position in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a positive move. Spanish 
Foreign Minister Javier Solana said that for the first time 
positions are coordinated. 
  [Begin Solana recording] If we are able to make this so by 
focusing all of our energies on it over the next few days. I 
repeat that the agreement that was reached with all the 
concerned parties is something we have been wishing for a good 
many months. [end recording]

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] The Spanish daily press has demonstrated 
a growing interest in environmental issues. Leading newspapers 
such as EL MUNDO, EL PAIS, DIARIO 16, and CINCO DIAS report 
regularly on this topic. The two latter sources have added 
weekly environmental supplements titled "Biosphere" and 
"Environment" respectively. The following are environmental 
issues being reported prominently in the Spanish press. 
<H5>  Environmental Complaints Viewed </H5>
  A 26 March article in EL PAIS notes that one-third of all 
complaints received by the Public Defender's Office in 1993 were 
related to the environment and of these 90 percent focused on 
noise pollution. Margarita Retuerto, acting public 
defender/ombudsman interviewed by EL PAIS, criticized Spain's 
legal track record on the environment. Retuerto said that Spain 
currently "lacks the legal framework" to properly handle 
environmental pollution cases and is at a further disadvantage 
due to its "disjointed and dispersed bureaucracy." Aside from 
noise pollution, citizens complained about "environmental 
pollution, insufficient protection for open spaces and 
waterways, and demanded the right to have greater access to 
environmental information." According to the Public Defender's 
Office, the number of environmental complaints rose steadily in 
1993, pointing to citizens' increased awareness. 
<H5>  ENDESA Case Profiled </H5>
  According to a 1 February commentary in CINCO DIAS by Maria 
A. Gonzalez, attorney and director of the Praxis Environmental 
Consulting firm, a current environmental case before the courts 
involves the National Electric Power Company (ENDESA). ENDESA's 
Teruel-based power plant is charged with spreading acid rain 
throughout a large forested area in El Maestrazgo, a mountainous 
district of the Castellon and Teruel provinces in eastern Spain. 
Approximately 200,000 hectares of forests in the El Maestrazgo 
region were ravaged with damages estimated at around 10 billion 
pesetas ($73 million). A 22 February article in CINCO DIAS by 
Arturo Cenzano reports that legal proceedings began six years 
ago and involve ENDESA's president Feliciano Fuster and three 
other executives. Fuster has been sentenced to pay a fine worth 
5 billion pesetas ($36.5 million). The prosecutor has asked for 
one-year prison sentences for these individuals, which has 
angered environmental groups demanding longer sentences. A 26 
March article in EL PAIS reports that ENDESA has already begun 
taking steps to reduce pollution stemming from its Teruel power 
plant. According to this article, in March 1994, Juan Manuel 
Eguiagaray, Minister of Industry and Energy announced that 
ENDESA would spend 23 billion pesetas ($167.9 million) to reduce 
sulfur dioxide emissions. 
  In her CINCO DIAS commentary, Gonzalez points to the 
difficulties inherent in determining guilt when several 
potential polluters are involved in a single case. Further 
difficulties arise when it comes to verifying and substantiating 
relationships between the causes and effects of pollution. In 
some cases, the cumulative effects of pollution cannot be 
ascribed to a single factor, but rather to a variety of causes 
that are completely unrelated. For example, in March 1993 CINCO 
DIAS published the findings of the Center for Environmental 
Studies on the Mediterranean (CEAM), which exonerated ENDESA of 
sole responsibility for causing acid rain in Castellon. The 
report blames two petrochemical complexes in southern France and 
the Piombino region in central Italy for spreading sulfur 
dioxide emissions in the Castellon district. 
  Cenzano's article notes that the ENDESA lawsuit has caused 
anxiety among people who depend on jobs created by the 
Teruel-based Electric Power Company. The Aragon Employers 
Association is concerned because ENDESA created 6,400 jobs in an 
area that has been struggling economically. According to 
Cenzano, members of the Employers Association defend ENDESA on 
the grounds that the company has been a proven leader in the 
fight against environmental waste by investing upwards of 30 
billion pesetas ($219 million) over the past few years. 
<H5>  Companies Seek Information on Environmental Issues </H5>
  The Center for Documentation and Information on Industry and 
the Environment (CIDIMA), located in Madrid, offers Spanish 
companies a wide range of information on environmental concerns 
and legislation, according to a 15 March report in CINCO DIAS by 
Ana Hernando. The center, which opened in February 1994, is 
located at and under the direction of the School for Industrial 
Organization (EOI). CIDIMA director Jesus Santa-Olalla, who was 
interviewed by CINCO DIAS, believes the center's customers will 
be small and medium-sized businesses that lack access to 
information on environmental standards. During its first month 
in operation, CIDIMA was primarily consulted by companies 
concerned about violating environmental standards, 
service-oriented companies, retailers, and a vast number of 
private and public institutions focusing on environmental 
issues. Most requests focused on EU [European Union] 
environmental standards and nonpolluting or "clean" technologies. 
  CIDIMA maintains contacts with similar centers in France, 
Germany, Denmark, and the United Kingdom for informational 
exchanges. For instance, the center has an ongoing agreement 
with the British Library. CIDIMA is currently busy setting up 
branches in several of Spain's autonomous communities so that 
environmental organizations within these areas can distribute 
CIDIMA services. EOI's board of directors is now considering 
establishing a CIDIMA branch in Seville, because it believes 
"this city could well become a springboard for providing CIDIMA 
services to South America." Negotiations are now under way with 
the Argentine Government to set up a branch in that country. 
  To set up CIDIMA, EOI invested 50 million pesetas 
($365,000), 
which also happens to be CIDIMA's projected annual budget. 
Santa-Olalla noted that at first companies felt "threatened by 
the large investments needed to equip businesses with 
environmentally sound technologies." Now, however, corporations 
are changing their attitudes and realizing that in the long run, 
the effects of environmental improvements will help them 
"generate larger profits and make their products more 
competitive." 
<H5>  Large Investments Needed To Adapt to EU Standards </H5>
  In the 15 March CINCO DIAS Ana Hernando quotes estimates of 
between 1.5 and 3 trillion pesetas ($10.9-21.9 billion) that 
would be needed to adapt Spanish industries to EU environmental 
standards. Reportedly, the chemical sector will require the 
largest investment. This sector will absorb an estimated 39 
percent of the financial aid available through the European Fund 
for Economic Compensation to introduce more environmentally 
sound technology. The energy sector will require an investment 
of 31 percent, the automobile industry 9 percent, and the 
construction industry 5 percent of the European Funds' financial 
assistance. Economic forecasts calculate that the Spanish oil 
industry will have to invest more than 500 billion pesetas 
($3.65 billion) during the next seven years to safeguard the 
environment. 
  The Ministry of Industry and Energy plans to promote 
projects 
and technologies geared toward reducing pollution levels. By EU 
standards, the environmental sector in Spain remains a fledgling 
one, since Spanish companies in this sector account for only 3 
percent of EU's total market for the environmental industry. By 
the year 2000, however, the environmental industry in Spain will 
grow to around 50 trillion pesetas ($365 billion).

<F P=106> [Jose Maria Brunet report: "Roca Rejects Early Election </F>
Because It Would Halt Economic Recovery"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Convergence and Union [CiU] spokesman 
Miquel Roca yesterday [in the Congress of Deputies] rejected 
bringing forward the election, since it would halt economic 
recovery and the struggle against corruption, and asserted the 
need for the anticorruption measures to be effected without 
calling into question the rule-of-law state's rules or the 
possibility of consolidating the economic improvement. Roca's 
speech was a plea for the government and its prime minister to 
accept their responsibilities in the struggle against 
corruption, but accompanied by greater arguments than on other 
occasions in defense of CiU's stance, with repeated criticisms 
of those condemning it. 
  "In some people's opinion," he said, "our conduct deserves 
to be described as blackmail, and this is also extended to 
Catalonia's citizens as a whole. This assertion is false, 
unfair, and offensive, but also -- and this is the worst thing 
-- irresponsible. Stirring up territorial apprehensions and 
resentments may be advantageous, but history disqualifies those 
raising these flags." 
  "I will not enter into the controversy," he added, "because 
that would be for us to enter slippery ground, very far from the 
calm that befits the country right now, but I wish to point out 
that it would be valid to maintain, with the same legitimacy 
that that accusation is leveled against us, that there are 
strategies that are based on the idea of the worse the better; 
that is, if the economic recovery were cut short, it would not 
be bad news for some people's election prospects." 
  Roca maintained the dual aim of explaining his own stance 
and 
criticizing that of those who condemn it in asserting that many 
of the criticisms that CiU is now receiving are being put in a 
bitter and offensive way. He added that the nationalist 
coalition does not disregard the criticisms it receives; it 
reflects on them, but "I must admit that they would make a 
greater impression on our spirit if those leveling them were not 
those who have always criticized us." "They are not doing so 
just now," he asserted: "They have always done so; their 
criticisms have old reminiscences of historical continuity." 
These passages provoked shouting and booing from the People's 
Party seats, which also broke out when Roca stated that CiU 
facilitates stability through its support, and that the economic 
situation is not deteriorating, as was recently acknowledged by 
one of the news media -- and he showed a page from EL MUNDO -- 
which "is characterized by a strongly critical stance on our 
group's policy." 
  "So you will not be surprised," he continued, "if I say that 
we are more pleased by the opinion of those who demand of our 
group a demanding stance that will at the same time bring calm, 
which requires of us very particularly that we try to serve the 
immediate aims of an economic recovery, without on that account 
forgoing demanding of the government a determined struggle 
against each and every cause of corruption." 
  Roca also stated that "nobody will dictate our policy to us 
from outside our coalition," and that "we accept the 
responsibility that we undertook." "We accept it as long as we 
believe that our effort serves some purpose, as long as the 
struggle against corruption is not called off, and as long as 
the the guidelines of economic and social policy that have made 
possible the current change of trend are not altered. If 
through this we achieve positive results for society as a whole, 
we will be satisfied to have done so, and if this were not so, 
we would accept our responsibility, but we would find ourselves 
obliged to renew our stance, because our commitment to this 
country's governability and stability has those aims."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Anguita Demands That Gonzalez </F>
Undergo Confidence Vote or Resign"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- [United Left (IU) Coordinator General] 
Julio Anguita stated yesterday, during the debate on the 
situation created by [former Civil Guard Director General] Luis 
Roldan's escape, that the solutions to the political crisis are 
for the People's Party to submit a censure motion, or for Felipe 
Gonzalez to resign or undergo a confidence vote, in which the 
nationalists would express their support for the government. 
"If there is no resignation by the prime minister, if there is 
no confidence vote, and if no censure motion is submitted," the 
IU coordinator general said, "let the Spanish people pass 
sentence 12 June and say who should carry it out." 
  In a tough but calm tone, for which Felipe Gonzalez gave 
thanks, following the tension of the debate with Aznar, the IU 
leader reiterated the reasons for demanding Gonzalez' 
resignation, "and in this order": unemployment, the destruction 
of the industrial fabric, an antisocial policy unparalleled 
throughout Europe, because he is the person responsible for the 
advance of not only the social but also the ideological right, 
and because he has encouraged an economic policy that 
facilitates corruption. 
  Anguita devoted part of his speech to explaining the need 
for 
Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra to appear before the Roldan 
committee, as being jointly responsible for the former Civil 
Guard director general's appointment, and to demanding that he, 
too, accept his responsibility by tendering his resignation. 
  Responding to Aznar's assertions that he cannot submit a 
censure motion because he does not have any political group's 
support, Anguita asserted that if the IU had a sufficient number 
of deputies to use this procedure, it would do so, as Felipe 
Gonzalez did when Suarez was prime minister, "while knowing that 
we would lose it, because it is no use making empty threats." 
He therefore regretted that the People's Party "did not submit 
a censure motion in order to listen to another government 
program." 
  He reiterated the demand for Gonzalez' resignation "for the 
sake of stability," "because I do not understand the Caesarism 
of the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party], which bases 
political stability on one person," and he asserted that if 
Gonzalez were replaced by another Socialist, the IU "would 
listen to the program and go all out for him if he changed 
policy." 
  Anguita demanded that Gonzalez undergo a confidence vote so 
that "the nationalists will say in parliament what you say they 
told you over the telephone, and thus we will know who is who." 
If none of this happens, he believes that an election will have 
to be called, since what is not possible is for everything to 
continue as hitherto, with the series of resignations, Luis 
Roldan's escape, and the jailing of [former Bank of Spain 
Governor] Mariano Rubio, since, he stated, if all this has 
happened without anybody's being aware, "the whole ministerial 
bench would have to go, but not because of joint responsibility 
but because of ineptitude."

<F P=106> [Interview with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller by </F>
Vincent Hugeux in Ankara; date not given: "Warning to Europe"] 
  [Text] Bosnia, gains by the Islamic party, the Kurdish 
question: Mrs. Tansu Ciller, Turkish prime minister since June 
1993, discusses the "sensitive" issues for LE VIF-L'EXPRESS. 
  [Hugeux] Is your country suffering from a geostrategic 
"devaluation?" 
  [Ciller] Quite the reverse. Turkey, the link with the Middle 
East, the only democratic and secular regime in the region, is 
more than ever a key country. We have made many sacrifices in 
our European integration effort. During the Iraqi aggression in 
Kuwait, Turkey immediately took part in the resistance. But 
people here are asking questions. Because that did not bring us 
the slightest support. And yet Greece, Portugal, and Spain 
received billions of dollars. 
  [Hugeux] Do you see that as ostracism by the "Christian 
stronghold?" 
  [Ciller] If the aim is to prevent new barriers from being 
erected after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Turkey has an 
essential role to play. The world is being reshaped. The duel 
between the market economy and socialism is over. But, we must 
now turn away from fundamentalism, be it Islamic or Christian. 
That is the real danger of the next decade. My country can 
provide a bridge between the two worlds, and hence toward peace. 
Neglecting it because it is Muslim would be to fuel 
fundamentalism on all sides. If the Bosnians had been 
Christians, would Europe have been so passive? 
  [Hugeux] How do you explain the UN failure in Bosnia? 
  [Ciller] It is possible to restructure the institutions. But 
there is something more serious: a lack of political will. The 
international community is showing a lack of determination. 
  [Hugeux] Should the embargo on arms destined for the Muslims 
be lifted? 
  [Ciller] If, as is claimed, we cannot protect them, the 
least 
we can do is to allow them to defend themselves. 
  [Hugeux] How would Ankara react if the conflict were 
extended 
to Macedonia or Kosovo? 
  [Ciller] In that case, nobody would be able to stand aside. 
Such a threat is a threat to the world not just to Turkey. 
  [Hugeux] Is this the right time to lift the sanctions 
against 
Iraq? 
  [Ciller] We will act in accordance with our allies and will 
not abolish the embargo on our own account. Even if it does 
impose a heavy burden on us. 
  [Hugeux] Do you fear a resurgence of Russian imperialism? 
  [Ciller] Helping Moscow to convert to the rules of the 
market 
is fine. But does this mean we should ignore the rise of 
nationalism? Supporting Russia without defending our values 
there, in the name of supporting a particular individual, may be 
contributing to this rise in nationalism. And it may feed the 
temptation to return to the "good old days" in the empire. It 
is for us to be vigilant. Russia is still the only superpower 
in the region with nuclear weapons. 
  [Hugeux] Does the breakthrough by the Party of Prosperity 
(Islamic) in the 27 March municipal elections worry you? 
  [Ciller] Ninety percent of the Turks favor a democratic and 
secular state. They have been voting in that way for almost 50 
years. But there are two reasons for this phenomenon. One is 
the feeling of having been rejected for too long by our Western 
allies. The second is the discontent linked with the economic 
crisis. Reducing inflation and the debt requires many 
sacrifices. 
  [Hugeux] Why are you giving way to the Army when faced with 
the PKK (Workers Party of Kurdistan)? 
  [Ciller] During the municipal elections, the PKK tried to 
persuade people not to vote. However, it is in the southeast 
that the highest participation was recorded. The safer people 
feel, the more they support us. Let us draw a distinction 
between citizens of Kurdish origin, whom our Army protects, and 
the PKK terrorists. Our efforts to promote the economic 
development of the southeast will shortly be felt. There is one 
certainty: We will defend our country against any separatist 
attempt. 
  [Hugeux] Is it necessary to modernize the doctrine inherited 
from Mustafa Kemal? 
  [Ciller] Of course. But it is not for the government to 
impose its interpretation of the dogma. It must be broadly 
debated. The fundamental principles remain: secularism and 
democracy. And we will not touch that.

<F P=106> [Report by Serdar Turgut and Mihrishah Safa: "A U.S. </F>
Suggestion for Violation of the Embargo"] 
  [Text] Washington-London--The U.S. Administration has drawn 
up a plan and submitted it to Ankara in the form of a "nonpaper" 
on flushing the oil in the pipeline between Karkuk and 
Yumurtalik. The plan indicates that the United States may agree 
to the withdrawal of all the 12 million barrels of oil from the 
pipeline on the condition that Ankara "temporarily" use 100 
percent of the profit from its sale. 
  Considering Iraq's sensitive approach on the embargo, 
however, Ankara wishes to resolve the pipeline problem in a way 
that will also be acceptable to Baghdad. Any consensus between 
Turkey and the UN Security Council must also take into account 
Baghdad's approach. It will be recalled that Iraq has rejected 
the UN condition for the sale of $1.6 billion worth of oil on 
grounds that it infringes on its sovereignty. 
  Only 3.8 million barrels of the oil in the pipeline belongs 
to Turkey. There is no problem on how Turkey's share will be 
used after it is drained. However, 60 percent of the profit to 
be made from the sale of the remaining 8.2 million barrels of 
oil will have to be transferred to the fund which will be under 
UN control. Another 30 percent will be registered with the UN as 
profit. Meanwhile, the remaining 10 percent will be used to 
provide humanitarian aid to Iraq. 
  The United States wishes to block any approach that may be 
regarded as violating the embargo on Iraq. In view of that, it 
seems that it is prepared to have Turkey use the profit from the 
sale of the 8.2 million barrels of oil and pay it back to the UN 
later on the basis of the 60-30-10 percent formula. However, 
Britain has informed Washington that it is opposed to that 
approach. It called for the use of only 60 percent of the profit 
to be made from the sale of all the oil in the pipeline. 
  Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs Bilgin Unan has 
held talks with British officials on the pipeline problem. He 
has left Britain for Moscow after being informed that London 
will agree in principle to the removal of the oil in the 
pipeline.

<F P=106> [Lale Sariibrahimoglu report: "Tanks From Greece to South </F>
Cyprus"] 
  [Excerpt] Ankara--Reports that several French-made AMX 30 
tanks, which are covered by the Conventional Forces in Europe 
[CFE] Treaty, have been dispatched to south Cyprus have prompted 
Ankara to prepare to warn France and Greece. The issue of 
several AMX 30 tanks, which were decommissioned in accordance 
with the CFE and then renovated in France and sent to south 
Cyprus, was on Turkey's agenda when Defense Minister Mehmet 
Golhan visited France last week. The decomissioned tanks should 
have been kept where they were parked. 
  France informed Golhan that it has received the tanks to 
renovate, because it is the country which manufactures and sells 
them. However, the French officials also informed Golhan that 
France has not reached agreement with Greece to dispatch those 
tanks to south Cyprus. Nevertheless, Turkey was not satisfied 
with the French disclosure. Recalling that the matter has been 
on Turkey's agenda for the past two years, the diplomatic 
sources say that Ankara will caution France and Greece either in 
bilateral contacts or in international platforms. It will ask 
Athens and Paris to provide information on the renovated tanks. 
Turkey will ask Greece to explain "whether or not it has 
dispatched to south Cyprus several tanks that have been 
decommissioned in accordance with the CFE Treaty and should have 
been kept in Greece's inventory." It will also ask that country 
"if it has transferred several tanks to France, which, according 
to the CFE Treaty, should have been based in Western Thrace, and 
if so, why it has failed to inform Turkey on the matter." 
  Meanwhile, Turkey will ask France to explain "whether the 
tanks referred to have been dispatched to south Cyprus and why 
Paris has failed to disclose the number of tanks France has 
received for renovation if it exceeds the number established by 
the CFE Treaty?" 
  Recalling that France has concluded an agreement with Greece 
to prevent that country from supplying the arms it buys from 
France to third countries, the diplomatic sources said: "If 
Greece intends to supply arms to south Cyprus, then France is 
obliged to caution Athens that it cannot do so." [passage

  [Text] Ankara, May 13 (A.A.) -- Parliament Speaker 
Husamettin Cindoruk met Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 
[TRNC] Prime Minister Hakki Atun today. 
  `Turkey will not accept a solution that is against TRNC,' 
Cindoruk said. 
  Cindoruk, speaking during a meeting with Atun, said Turkey 
supports a solution on the Cyprus issue but it should not be 
one-sided and forcible. 
  Atun said that the TRNC parliament has no intention of 
making 
concessions on the Cyprus issue adding that the Turkish 
parliament always supported the TRNC and called the recent UN 
proposals `unacceptable.' 
  He said the UN-proposed confidence-building measures failed 
to create a secure atmosphere. 
  `The package was an instrument to seize land from TRNC,' he 
said. 
  Atun said although they made changes in the 
confidence-building measures to satisfy Greek Cypriot leader 
Kliridhis, Turkey still continues its goodwill to mend the 
situation.

<F P=106> [Lale Sariibrahimoglu report: "Problem of 12-Mile </F>
Territorial Waters in the Aegean Sea"] 
  [Text] Ankara--The disagreement between Turkey and Greece 
on Athens' intention to extend Greek territorial waters in the 
Aegean Sea to 12 miles has escalated as the time approaches for 
the Maritime Law Agreement to come into effect on 16 November. 
Greek Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said 
yesterday that Greece's approach to the matter has not changed. 
He also stressed that "extending the Greek territorial waters 
to 12 miles is a matter that concerns Greece's sovereign rights." 
  In a statement to CUMHURIYET, Greek diplomatic sources in 
Ankara have reiterated that extending Greek territorial waters 
to 12 miles is a matter of Greek sovereign rights. However, 
they also said: "Greece does not intend to extend its 
territorial waters to 12 miles." 
  Replying to a question about a press report yesterday, 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman has said that a move by 
Greece to extend its territorial waters to 12 miles would be 
unacceptable. Meanwhile, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry 
official informed CUMHURIYET that Turkey would regard a move by 
Greece to extend its territorial waters to 12 miles in 
contravention of international agreements as an act of war. 
  Turkey has reservations about various provisions of the 
Maritime Law Agreement, particularly Article 3. The agreement 
was signed in 1982 and has so far been ratified by 60 countries. 
According to that article, the signatory countries are 
authorized to extend their territorial waters up to 12 miles.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that the 
United Nations, which was established to secure lasting peace in 
the world, had serious failures in achieving its goal during 
this past term. 
  Cetin was addressing the first meeting of the national 
committee set up for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, 
which will be marked next year. He pointed out that the 
massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina today is the result of a lack of 
political will on the part of the United Nations. Actually, he 
explained, the will of the United Nations is determined by the 
decision of a few countries. The decision of the five permanent 
members of the UN Security Council becomes the resolution of the 
entire United Nations. Naturally, at times, it is the interests 
of the permanent members that is reflected in a UN resolution or 
in its implementation. Consequently, it would be better to 
criticize the UN decisionmaking mechanism rather than the 
organization and its aims. 
  Cetin pointed out that the phrase "We the peoples of the 
world" has been accepted as the slogan of the 50th anniversary 
celebrations, stressing that this saddles the United Nations 
with great responsibilities that must be fulfilled.

  [Text] Istanbul--Teams from the Directorate of Police 
antiterror department have arrested Veysel Bozcali, a Workers 
Party of Kurdistan [PKK] terrorist. He trained as an explosives 
expert in one of the PKK camps in Greece, and arrived in 
Istanbul to bomb several tourist sites in the city. Meanwhile, 
the teams also arrested nine other PKK members, three of whom 
are women. 
  The antiterror department has disclosed that six of the 
terrorists trained in a camp close to the border between Germany 
and the Netherlands some time ago. They then crossed into 
Greece, where they were trained as bomb experts by the Greek 
secret service organization. The terrorists later crossed the 
Maritsa River into Turkey. 
  Veysel Bozcali was arrested while preparing to carry out his 
terrorist activities.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has called on the 
Turkish citizens living abroad to contribute to the country in 
order to overcome Turkey's economic difficulties. Ciller said: 
Just think that if each of the 1 million citizens working 
abroad contributes only 1,000 German marks [DM], it will amount 
to 1 billion DM. Give the Turkish economy this strength, she 
added. Ciller announced that those that will send foreign 
currency to Turkey will be entitled to certain rights. In her 
speech which was broadcast by TRT-INT, Ciller pointed out that 
in addition to contributing to the development of the country 
wherein they reside, the Turkish citizens working in Europe are 
a proof of the longing Turkish people can have for their 
country. Ciller said: We are proud of the Turkish worker in 
Europe who serves as a bridge in promoting Turkey, a developing 
and progressing country. Ciller also stressed that the Turkish 
citizens in Europe are contributing greatly to Turkey's 
development with the money they send. 
  Explaining that Turkey is going through difficult times and 
that the Turkish people want to share the blessings of the world 
with other people, Ciller said: We are determined, together 
with you, to create a leading Turkey; a developed, esteemed, 
respected Turkey with a high standard of education. 
  Ciller stressed that the reason some people do not want a 
strong Turkey is due to its deep-rooted and dignified history -- 
reigning over a variety of people of different races, religions, 
and languages from the Indian Ocean to Central Europe. 
Explaining that those who cannot stand the fact that Turkish is 
being spoken from the Adriatic Sea to the Great Wall of China 
are afraid of the influence Turkey may have on the world and on 
the region with an improved economy. 
  Explaining that some people use terrorism as a means to 
divide Turkey, Ciller added that the end of the murderers are in 
sight thanks to the success of the security forces and the 
support of the people. Ciller said: Our determination in 
fighting terrorism destroyed the separatist bandits' ploys 
concerning Turkey. We are forced to spend the money allocated 
to the development of the country to fighting terrorism. Now 
the time has come to deal with the economy. We will overcome 
the economic problems with everybody's help and sacrifices. 
  Ciller continued: This country is our country. There is no 
other Turkey in the world and we believe that we will restore 
the economy with if we are united in faith. Indicating that the 
aim of the 5 April decisions is improving the economy, Ciller 
said: 
  [Begin Ciller recording] We will crush the monster called 
inflation and we will return the money of the people to the 
people and to our children. We will reestablish trust in the 
Turkish lira, to our national money. Of course, we have to 
trust our currency. If we trust ourselves, we also have to trust 
our national currency. We want to develop the economy and base 
it on secure foundations, in short, we want to put to right our 
economy. We rolled up our sleeves and started laying the 
foundations for constructive changes in the economy and you will 
see that when this process ends our country will be stronger 
than ever. [end recording] 
  Ciller indicated that Turkish citizens who are working 
abroad 
or who own businesses abroad have also the same determination. 
Indicating that the deposits of the Turkish workers abroad 
amount to 30 billion DM, Ciller concluded that, for this reason, 
Europe needs Turkey and its workers. Explaining that Turkey's 
integration with Europe is near and that Europe has to open its 
doors to Turkey, Ciller said that during this period Turkish 
citizens everywhere have to unite and face the difficulties hand 
in hand, as a single body. Expressing that she has no doubts 
that Turkish citizens living abroad will continue to stand 
united and together in all areas of concern to Turkey, Ciller 
recalled that on 5 April she called on everybody to make 
sacrifices according to their own capacity. Stressing that unity 
breeds force, Ciller called on the citizens living abroad to 
make the same sacrifices. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] Just think that, if each of our 1 
million citizens living abroad send 1,000 DM per person, it will 
amount to 1 billion DM. Give the Turkish economy this force. 
This is a kind of economic war of independence. If we unite, 
we can win this war. Let us put our country among the leading 
countries of Europe. Let us do this all together, shoulder to 
shoulder. In addition, I would like it to be known that those 
who send foreign currency to the country will be granted some 
rights in a very short time upon presentation of the proper 
documents and receipts. Come, deposit your savings, starting 
this Monday, in Turkish banks and the Central Bank. Yes, come 
and let us make this week a turning point. [end recording] 
  Ciller said that the accounts Turkish citizens living abroad 
will open in the Turkish banks will be given more interest rates 
than their country of residence and added that all saving 
deposits are under state guarantee.

<F P=106> [Christopher Lockwood report: "`Tortoise' Delors is Holding </F>
Back EC, Says Clarke"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, 
launched a sharp attack on M Jacques Delors, the president of 
the European Commission, yesterday, characterising him as a 
bureaucrat resisting the reform of his institution and producing 
change "at the pace of a tortoise". 
  Mr Clarke's outburst is only the latest of a series of 
highly 
public clashes between the Socialist M Delors and Mr Clarke. 
Late last year they quarrelled over the cost to Britain of 
implementing the EC's clean water directive as well as over M 
Delors's masterplan to jump-start the European economy with 
job-creating infrastructural investments funded by large-scale 
borrowing. 
  Yesterday, finance ministers were holding a regular meeting 
in Brussels at which they discussed a German proposal to set up 
a "deregulation taskforce", an advisory group of businessmen 
which would advise the EC on cutting back on red tape. 
  Britain strongly supports the idea. "We are lagging in 
making 
any real progress on removing the burden of excessive regulation 
of competitive industries," Mr Clarke explained. But at the 
meeting, M Delors protested strongly, arguing that this sort of 
outside advice risked undermining the authority of the 
Commission and proposing instead limited consultation between 
businesses and individual units of the Commission. Mr Clarke 
said: "Mr Delors has given a perfect illustration of how a 
bureaucracy will not reform its own procedures. He is 
impervious to the suggestion." 
  He said that M Delors's proposals "would produce progress at 
the pace of a tortoise . . . I think it is a pity that the 
outgoing president has reacted so strongly in favour of the 
status quo. It is no good leaving these reforms to the 
Commission." 
  Mr Clarke also condemned M Delors for discussing the 
follow-up to his White Paper (the master-plan he produced last 
December) only with foreign ministers and not with finance 
ministers. This has long been a sore point with Mr Clarke, who 
feels that those who control the purse-strings are 
insufficiently consulted as M Delors spins his grandiose 
schemes. 
  Earlier, Mr Clarke had lashed out at M Delors's number two, 
Commission vice-president Henning Christophersen. Last week Mr 
Christophersen produced estimates showing that Britain's growth 
rate, the highest in Europe this year, will fall back next year 
to one of the lowest. 
  Mr Clarke said: "The figures are plainly wrong. The 
Commission has made a mistake. They are only forecasts, and 
forecasts are often wrong." Later, he returned to the subject: 
"I think they are wrong. The IMF thinks they are wrong, and 
most independent forecasters think they are wrong." But he was 
forced to concede that the difference between Mr 
Christophersen's estimate and Treasury figures was only 0.2 
percent, well within the accepted margin of error.

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, May 16 (AFP) -- European Union [EU] 
foreign ministers gave their formal and unanimous endorsement 
here Monday [16 May] to a new U.S.-Russian-EU effort to end the 
two-year war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The decision followed an agreement in Geneva on Saturday 
between the United States, Russia and five EU countries -- 
France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and Greece -- to push for a 
four-month ceasefire and new negotiations. 
  "We all believe it will be a reasonable basis for ending the 
war," British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said. 
  Meanwhile, EU mediator Lord Owen and his UN counterpart, 
Thorvald Stoltenberg, left Geneva for Belgrade for discussions 
with Serb leaders. 
  And diplomats said the contact group for Bosnia -- 
comprising 
Americans, Russians, Germans, French and Britons -- would meet 
in Washington for two days this week to prepare for negotiations 
to implement the Geneva initiative. 
  Both Moslem and Serb leaders in Bosnia gave a chilly initial 
reception to the initiative, which would give a proposed 
Moslem-Croat federation 51 percent of Bosnia, and the Serbs 49 
percent, down from the 70 percent they currently hold. 
  The Moslems and Croats are claiming this is not enough. They 
want 58 percent, on the grounds that together the two groups 
make up 61 percent of the population. However, the Serbs want 
to be left with more than 49 percent. 
  But French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said that the Geneva 
initiative was the only realistic solution to the Bosnian 
conflict and that the EU had a duty to keep pressing the 
combatants towards a negotiated settlement. 
  "If there is an accord, and if the Bosnian Serbs make the 
necessary territorial concessions, the EU is disposed to phasing 
out economic sanctions against Serbia," the French minister said. 
  Hurd added: "If there is an agreement, there will have to be 
a substantial Serb withdrawal" from areas it has captured in 
Bosnia. 
  Special Russian envoy on ex-Yugoslavia Vitaly Churkhin said 
in Belgrade that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was ready 
for a ceasefire. 
  The Geneva initiative offers little that is new in 
comparison 
with an accord between the warring parties negotiated in 
November 1993, which subsequently fell apart. 
  But diplomats here reported intense relief among EU leaders 
that the United States and Russia had this time accepted the 
principle of a 51-49 percent division of Bosnia. 
  The EU foreign ministers also agreed on 32 million ECU (37 
million dollar) in aid this year to finance the temporary 
administration of the southern Bosnian city of Mostar. 
  Fighting between Croats and Moslems there has eased off over 
the past two months as the two sides negotiated a Moslem-Croat 
federation in Bosnia, brokered by the United States. 
  The EU-appointed administrator of Mostar, former Bremen 
mayor 
Hans Koschnik, said he hoped to leave for the town next month 
with a team of up to 40 people. 
  Their mission, Koschnik said, was to help Mostar residents 
organise themselves to overcome the effects of the Bosnian civil 
war. 
  Asked about their chances of success, he told journalists: 
"It is still a better answer than letting people kill each 
other." 
  But Koschnik warned that a "cold war" situation of mistrust 
still existed between the Croats and Moslems of Mostar.

  [Excerpt] Warnemuende (DDP/ADN) -- Despite the savings in 
the Bundeswehr budget, there will not be any reduction in troops 
in the states of former East Germany nor will any investment 
plans be dropped. This was stated by Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe on the sidelines of a sitting of the Bundesrat defense 
committee in Warnemuende on Monday [16 May]. Contracts 
totalling almost a billion marks will be awarded to the 
construction industry this year for the seven large-scale 
Bundeswehr projects in eastern Germany, including establishing a 
marine technology academy in Parow near Stralsund and the 
planned move of the marine office to Warnemuende. 
  Ruehe also announced that troop numbers would be increased 
according to plans in the east, increasing from the present 
19,200 to 23,000 soldiers and almost 7,000 civilian employees. 
The figure of 20,000, by which the Bundeswehr is to be cut over 
the next few years, will mainly be saved in the states of the 
former West Germany, the defense minister said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, May 17 (AFP) -- France will slash its 
peacekeeping presence in the former Yugoslavia from 6,000 troops 
to 3,500 soldiers by the end of the year, Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard said Tuesday [17 May]. 
  "We have begun a process of withdrawal of a certain number 
of 
battalions we have there, first the one in Glina in Krajina 
(Serb-controlled territory in Croatia) and then the one in Bihac 
in northwest Bosnia," Leotard said in a radio interview. 
  "Before the end of the year, there will be about 2,500 fewer 
French soldiers on the territory of the former Yugoslavia," he 
said. 
  The move came after Foreign Minister Alain Juppe threatened 
to pull out all French troops, who make up the largest 
contingent of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in former 
Yugoslavia, if progress towards a peace settlement was not made. 
  The French UN troops are deployed in both Croatia and 
Bosnia. 
There are also French naval forces patrolling the Adriatic Sea 
and French aircraft based in Italy.

Silvio Berlusconi to the Senate in Rome -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Mr. Speaker, Senators: The government I am 
presenting to the chambers of parliament, and for which I am 
seeking your confidence, in itself marks a completely new event 
in our country's public life. 
  First, this government has been born of a republican 
parliament for the first time elected on the first-past-the-post 
system desired by the vast majority of citizens. Second, the 
government's support is based on elected MPs in political 
parties which have never had ministerial responsibilities. This 
radical innovation is the fruit of a long and tortuous crisis of 
credibility of our institutions -- a crisis which swept away in 
name and deed the quasisupremacy of the parties which 50 years 
ago gave life to the Italian republic. 
  Good policies are always the result of reflecting on what a 
maestro of renaissance ideology called the experience of things 
ancient and things modern. Indeed, what is new, for better or 
worse, is defined by its relationship with what is old. On this 
question -- in other words, on our relationship with the 
fundamentals of 50 years of republican life -- we must make one 
thing once and for all clear from the outset, because domestic 
and international public opinion is curious about and interested 
in this change, and in some cases it is understandably concerned. 
  This government sees itself, without any doubt, as being 
within the legal foundation embodied in the constitution of 
1948. Following the defeat of fascism in Europe the choice of 
democracy as the as the supreme value of liberal action is the 
common and explicit objective of all components of the majority. 
  The past has been judged in different ways, but all agree in 
considering civil liberty as the basis for public life and in 
loyally respecting our constitutional architecture. The unity 
of the country and its indivisibility is another principle on 
which the majority agree without any reservation. Italy is a 
republic with a strong system of local and territorial autonomy 
wanted by all constituents on the basis of a long tradition 
whose roots are set in the communal life. The world sees us as 
the country of 100 cities, and our geographical, political, and 
cultural landscape would be unrecognizable if the great and rich 
variety of life which both unites and distinguishes the North 
from the South is not taken into account. Within these limits 
and boundaries, the majority regards with respect and interest 
the federalist debate, which is old and new both in its European 
dimension and in the sense of a better working of the nation. 
  Loyalty to NATO, economic and political cooperation in the 
European Community, the repudiation of war as a way of solving 
international disputes, the principles of the Helsinki 
conference on the stability of borders, on the defense of human 
rights, and on the self-determination of peoples and 
noninterference: These are other fundamental components of this 
coalition's identity and the programme with which it has 
undertaken to form a government able to match up to Italy's 
international role. 
  Notwithstanding the great progress made in the Middle East 
peace process and the extraordinary election of Nelson Mandela 
as president of South Africa, new wars are breaking out across 
the world. In the heart of black Africa, in Rwanda, terrible 
acts of violence are even being carried out on poor and 
defenseless children. The Bosnian tragedy on our doorstep 
continues to make the news, but neither Europe nor the United 
Nations seem able to bring it to an end. Anywhere in the the 
world where freedom and human rights are brought into question, 
Italy's voice must be heard, and the government will make every 
effort to make it heard. Solidarity, based on the Christian and 
humanistic roots of our culture, is at the heart of our foreign 
policy. 
  The foreign minister is in Brussels, and is already at work 
to affirm and strengthen Italy's leading role in the European 
Union. Italy will support the widening of the Union, even toward 
East Europe, and increasing commercial links with the free trade 
areas of North America and the Pacific -- also to avoid the 
consolidation of spiralling protectionism. Careful 
consideration of the Maastricht Treaty must not delay the 
realization of the unification program, and we must forbid any 
indulgence concerning common defense or foreign policy. 
  Two important foreign policy appointments are the European 
Council meeting in June, and the G-7 summit. In the first of 
these meetings the realization of Jacques Delors' white paper 
will be discussed and the new president of the Union's 
Commission will be chosen. In Naples, where Italy is playing 
host to the leaders of the world's major industrialized nations, 
careful attention will be paid to the issue concerning the 
treaty of friendship with Russia, and the summit will be the 
occasion to consolidate our country's role in the world as well 
as its tried and tested diplomatic skills. 
  Senators, respect for our country's republican traditions 
and values cannot be unjustly used to hinder the process of deep 
change and renewal that our people urgently and passionately 
demand from us. The citizens have every right in the world to 
demand this from their representatives in the government. For 
years institutions and political parties were the same thing. 
Laws and civil servants -- starting from the cabinet -- were 
totally controlled by the forces which, under the old 
proportional system, represented the country. It has quite 
rightly been said that parties must step back today, while 
maintaining the role assigned to them by the constitution. I 
can add that we must move from the government of parties to the 
government of institutions. We are lucky because those who wrote 
the constitution devised a process to introduce any kind of 
change, provided they do not affect the state's form and the 
nation's unity. We must carefully follow that process. 
  One of the main characteristics of the majority which has 
created the new cabinet can be seen by everybody: The forces 
which support this government are together not because of some 
alliance decided by the parties, but because they have received 
a direct mandate from voters. What we called the Freedom 
Alliance was an alliance for the elections which has now become 
a government coalition with a clear mandate from the citizens. 
[passage omitted] 
  We now have to take a step: We must return the power to 
public institutions, starting with parliament. We must 
re-create a strong respect for the state and respect for the 
cabinet. We must repeat that private associations, parties, and 
movements have an essential role to play. But this role is 
clearly different from the role played by those in charge of the 
administration of public assets and those who are in the cabinet. 
  In this framework, it is very important to have a correct, 
competitive, and loyal relationship with the Left and Center. 
[passage omitted] I have to be very frank with the secretary of 
the Democratic Party of the Left who said that he wants to 
oppose the government democratically and within the limits of 
the constitution. He called this cabinet a government which 
humiliates Italy. This is not a good start. [applause] This is 
the country's legitimate government, freely chosen by the voters 
and led by me, chosen by the head of state. To call it 
humiliating is a gratuitous insult to the prestige and honor of 
the country. [applause] [passage omitted] 
  The presence in the cabinet of ministers belonging to the 
National Alliance cannot be used as an excuse for a campaign of 
defamation. [passage omitted] The opposition not only has the 
right but also the duty to prepare -- with all its forces and 
also with all the tricks of the trade it knows -- an alternative 
to this government. But it has no right whatsoever to pursue 
the goal of stopping the country from having a government. 
[applause] 
  Senators, the government's economic program has as its first 
goal the broadening of the country's productive base and the 
creation of new jobs. Prosperity and happiness in this country 
will first of all depend on the country's ability to give to 
citizens of all ages -- and to the young in particular -- a 
decent job and wage. Businessmen and the fantastic network of 
small and medium enterprises which created wealth in this 
country -- in the fields of agriculture, industry, and trade -- 
want to be helped to conquer new markets again, to be able to be 
competitive and to increase productivity in order to create new 
jobs. All the parties I spoke to while forming this cabinet 
told me that the creation of new jobs is a hard but possible 
task and that the fulfillment of this task must absolutely 
follow economic and social recovery after years of stagnation. 
We must control inflation and we must act to control and reduce 
public debt. This means that there is little scope for new 
public spending. [passage omitted] One thing is certain: State 
bonds cannot be written off in any case whatsoever. The public 
savings belonging to people who put their trust in the state 
cannot be damaged. The government knows very well that recovery 
will not be sustainable without deep and sharp action on public 
spending. This is what the financial markets demand, and this 
is what is required to slow down the growth of public debt. 
This is also a necessary condition if we want to participate in 
the process of European integration and it is a condition for 
the long-term fall of interest rates and for the resumption of 
private investments. [passage omitted] 
  A modern state, a big industrial nation -- deeply rooted in 
West Europe and wide open to the world -- has many resources, 
often hidden by the figures relating to the public sector. The 
government and the ruling class must use these resources in 
order to induce growth. This is the main task of a liberal 
government. This is the the government's objective. There is 
an Italy of the private sector -- both in the production and 
service sectors -- which can and must be encouraged to stand on 
its own feet. [passage omitted] 
  We must change a lot and free the private sector from 
oppressive obstacles, from the weight of a suffocating 
bureaucracy, from a tax burden which has become too heavy too 
quickly and which has proved to be a burden for those who create 
wealth and useless for the state's finances. [passage omitted] 
  The Greens in Italy have not yet become -- in spite of the 
importance and appeal of their ideas -- as important as in other 
European countries. However, this government thinks that the 
research and proposals made by the Greens over all these years 
must be used by the government as part of its policy. [passage 
omitted] 
  A fundamental part of our program concerns the structure of 
public and private health care. This is a very sensitive area 
for Italians. Citizens know that too much is being spent and 
that it is being spent badly. There is a great deal of chaos 
and the inefficiency of services is a permanent slur on the 
right to health care. It is urgent that managers run hospitals 
and that the health care system is made more efficient and 
competitive. We all feel bound to keep this promise, this 
undertaking, without any reservations. 
  We undertake, within the first 100 days of this government 
-- 
in the first stage of our program -- to unveil our legislative 
proposals for reducing the tax burden on companies which create 
real, new, jobs, for making it possible to hire workers on a 
names basis; for making it possible for companies with between 
three and 15 employees to hire directly; for modifying training 
contracts so that they present more of an incentive to 
companies; for introducing temporary work contracts and 
modifying the previous government's proposals, for introducing 
norms which make it possible to set working hours and create 
part time jobs, above all for women, as well as other measures 
which increase flexibility in the workplace; for revising norms 
concerning public contracts in order to avoid the continuation 
of the freeze on public administration contracts. The 
government undertakes to speed up the process of privatizing 
state companies, starting with INA, STET, ENEL and ENI; to 
remove the tax on incomes of less than 10 million lire -- also 
to meet the expectations of millions of senior citizens, who 
have the right to be protected and to have the purchasing power 
of their incomes safeguarded, safeguarded -- and to introduce 
tax incentives to stimulate investment, especially in small and 
medium-sized companies. [passage omitted] 
  The government's priorites will be to reduce the number of 
laws, using regulations and other administrative instruments 
wherever this is possible, to simplify direct and indirect 
taxation, and to run the public administration keeping in mind 
the needs and interests of the citizens, on whom the nation is 
built and society's affluence based, and who should not be the 
enemies or victims of bureaucracy. [passage omitted] 
  The system of guarantees safeguarding the interests of 
citizens in all areas will be confirmed and strengthened, from 
the administration of justice to information, a sector -- 
especially as far as concerns radio and television -- which must 
be assured of a market comprising a qualified public presence 
alongside a variety of other operators. 
  This government wants to bring morality to public life. This 
work has been undertaken by brave judges, by press and sectors 
of the political and social world. This is a government of 
irreproachable people, who respect the laws and moral code of 
public life. [applause] This government will not question the 
independence of the judiciary. The penal system will be 
supported so that those pending investigations of suspected of 
corruption will be held in an atmosphere of civilized law and 
respect for all laws by the Justice Ministry, the judges, and 
those representing the plaintiffs and the defendants. 
  The government's first task is to guarantee order and public 
safety so that citizens' lives are respected and safeguarded. 
In this area my predecessors' record is far from negative. 
Organized crime and the Mafia remain a danger and a cause for 
alarm, and it would be suicidal to lower our guard now. A long 
season of civil reawakening, which has visited public 
institutions and society -- all of society, but especially in 
the South -- has had extraordinary results. The Mafia has been 
recognized for what it is -- a single, organized criminal 
organization with historical and social roots which are 
difficult to destroy without a collective effort on the part of 
the state and the public. 
  Alongside the work of many honest judges, of many police 
officers, Carabinieri, and of the Armed Forces, are the 
committed protest movements which have raised their voices 
against crime and the Mafia. The question of the often 
ambiguous and always insidious links between Mafia and politcs, 
between organized crime and the parties, has been tackled head 
on. This country can boast of and is honored by what has been 
done in the war against crime without prejudicing freedom or 
constitutional rights. In common with every other area, there 
are still serious problems which must be solved. The legal 
authorities and the judicial police must be supplied with 
improved instruments with which to operate, investigating judges 
must be properly equipped, and all judges must be guaranteed 
their independence and peace of mind. 
  At the same time, according to various sources, including 
the 
best informed sectors of the legal world, it would be opportune 
to revise the legislation concerning cooperation the law, known 
as the supergrass phenomenon. On this matter, the government 
bows to a fundamental principle: It will not do anything to 
weaken the capacity to cooperate or to corrode criminal 
organizations from within, but it will actively operate to 
prevent the supergrass phenomenon from becoming a flagrant 
violation of rights. Among others, two great Italian judges 
gave their lives in the battle for law against the Mafia, and in 
their name -- the names are Giovanni Falcone and Paolo 
Borsellino [applause] -- the government feels obliged to 
continue this work. [applause] 
  The problem of a conflict of interest in government has 
quite rightly been raised, sometimes fairly and at other times 
with a touch of spite and to score all too obvious political 
points, insofar as the head of this government is a businessman. 
It is our belief, beyond the only too obvious considerations, 
that the prime minister is fully aware of his role as the 
guardian of public interest, and that Italy has a strong system 
of checks and balances. There is the head of state, with whom we 
have a relationship based on trust and to whom we send our 
respectful regards; the anti-trust authority; the publishing 
watchdog; the judiciary, the collective nature of the Council of 
Ministers and its decision-making procedures; and, of course, 
the special role of the opposition. Turning to the 
strengthening of some of these powers, which still lack official 
sanction, in its first sitting the Council of Ministers has 
already decided to set up a committee of experts who by the end 
of September will be called upon to make proposals which we will 
undertake to transform into draft laws. The government asks, 
above all in this area, that it be judged on its deeds and not 
on the basis of preconceived ideas. 
  On the other hand, we must point out that everything is 
possible as far as checking conflicting interests, apart from 
one thing: You cannot establish that a businessman does not 
have the same political rights as all other citizens. 
[applause] There is nothing in the constitution or the legal 
system of this country which casts even the slightest doubt on 
the legitimacy of the formation of this government or on the 
task of leading it which the head of state has given me. 
[passage omitted] 
  Today there are conditions for a real change, to give new 
breath to the great love and passion for freedom which for 
centuries has fuelled our highest and most serious political and 
civic life -- the state. The state has no other ideology but 
that of tolerance and the most honest rejection of any form of 
racism, of anti-Semitism, of xenophobia. It has the duty to 
respect all minorities, including the ethnic minorities, to 
attain a balance in its relationship with the different 
religious beliefs. These are principles and values which we 
reaffirm with conviction because we are against all forms of 
intolerance and discrimination and are aware of the dangers 
lurking behind any form of anti-Semitism, historically the most 
odious form of discrimination in Europe but not the only one, of 
defining one's neighbor as the enemy. 
  With the Catholic church, beyond the Concordat, there is a 
relationship of coexistence and collaboration. I take advantage 
of this opportunity to wish His Holiness Pope John Paul II, a 
pope who has done much for freedom and peace in the world, my 
heartfelt hopes for a speedy recovery. [applause] 
  The task of building a freer Italy belongs to everyone, to 
the lay Italians and to the Catholic Italians, of which I am 
one. It is a task to be carried out starting from the most 
extraordinary social institution which recent times has produced 
-- education open to all. [passage omitted] 
  Today everybody, or nearly everybody, says they are liberal 
democrats. This is triumph of which we ought to be proud. If 
words have any meaning, this means that the power of the state 
should put a barrier, a limit, coinciding with the sphere of 
indvidual rights. When a citizen ends up by depending for his 
own survival on professional politicians and bureaucracy, then 
it becomes useless to talk of freedom. When an excessive part 
of earned or saved income is confiscated by the bureaucracy 
without being put into necessary and defective services, then 
the limits of power are breached and beyond the intentions an 
illiberal government is born. [applause] 
  Without haste, without trauma, with cautious gradualness, 
the 
government intends to work so that the tax system gets only the 
amount compatible with absolute collective needs, returning 
overpayments and therefore giving greater freedom. What will 
become of the social welfare state if too much is asked of the 
traditional social services in crises? What will become of 
solidarity? My personal reply and that of the government on 
this matter is not unequivocal. Austerity implies eliminating 
social benefits of the past because progressive degeneration has 
led to an impoverishment of the whole of society which is an 
inefficient and deceptive reflection of social solidarity. But 
this should coincide with a new beginning of a policy of real 
solidarity counting on effective and decisive support for the 
weakest sectors, for the less protected, for those who live in 
real conditions of marginalization and suffering and poverty, 
which constitute a daily affront to modern society. [applause] 
  If I were to say what the final legacy of our government 
would be, I would say that this would be demonstrating that a 
freer society can be a more solid society, more coherent, and 
that there is no need for a sullen government, which is a 
stranger to the lives of our people, to carry out the aims of 
autonomy for the individual and communities. 
  And it is with this spirit, and without any other meaning, 
that the government has decided to set up a minister for the 
family. [applause] 
  We will work with parliament, in a constructive dialogue 
with 
the opposition, on a program, approved by the political majority 
in the country. It is our constitutional duty. We will attempt 
to discharge it with dignity and with compassion. 
  The government is aware of the fact that there is a 
disparity in the balance between the two houses of parliament, 
with a different distribution of seats. The government believes 
that it will work to respect the autonomy of the opposition. 
  Only an open and loyal dialogue based on mutual effort and 
mutual recognition of values can produce what the country is 
waiting for and what it needs -- a government of change, a 
working government that enjoys the confidence of parliament and 
a phase of political stability in which the majority and 
opposition play their different but complementary roles. On 
this point we are open to a dialogue with the opposition, in 
particular with the Center, which evolves from the tradition of 
Christian populism. To renounce this role would be an act of 
pure irresponsibility to the country. 
  From this point of view I have no difficulty in asking even 
the opposition, and independent senators, for a vote of 
confidence which will represent respect for the needs of the 
government and not necesarily as a political credit for the team 
I have the honor to lead. 
  Finally, allow me to remind you, Mr. Speaker and senators, 
of 
the real spirit fuelling the coalition, the government, I have 
the honor to lead. Ours is a country of extraordinary vitality, 
capable of miraculous leaps which surprise the world, and joie 
de vivre. For some time difficulties in political life, the 
crisis in the ruling class, and a certain atmosphere of mistrust 
have introduced into Italy a certain amount of universal 
pessimism and skepticism which risks turning into a subtle and 
lethal poison. 
  Our aim is to overturn this situation. Our focus is on the 
people who, having more experience of life and its harshness 
than of palace politics, still know that the institutions and 
the state are the mirror of society. Even I, as others before 
me, have had a dream -- the dream of complete openness and 
returning to society, from which so many new parliamentarians 
and ministers come, that impulse, vitality and creativity which 
are the real great genetic heritage of the Italian people. 
[applause] 
  To reach this goal the prime minister needs your help and 
support for the government but the country also has a strong, 
and I would say desperate, need to again find its strong will 
and stubborness, its taste for challenge and exploring new 
things, the pleasure of dislodging, wherever they might be, the 
bad temptations of fear, envy, and factiousness. 
  My government aim remains that which made me take up 
politics 
and the civic duty of challenge. I believe in a great 
collective enterprise, in a great adventure which has need of 
fire and moral faith. I believe that it is possible to dream 
with eyes wide open of the reality that is coming -- the future. 
I believe that we will be able to build a more just Italy, a 
more generous and more solicitous Italy toward those who need it 
and those who suffer, a more modern and efficient Italy, more 
prosperous and calm, more orderly and safer. 
  I am absolutely convinced that with the help of God and man 
we will manage it. Thank you. [applause]

<F P=106> [Carmen del Riego report: "Aznar Accuses Felipe Gonzalez of </F>
Passivity and Connivance in Roldan's Escape"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Jose Maria Aznar yesterday [in the 
Congress of Deputies] accused the prime minister of "passivity, 
obstruction, and negligence," both in the struggle against 
corruption and in the escape of [former Civil Guard Director 
General] Roldan, and although he did not directly demand 
Gonzalez' resignation -- "a suggestion that has become the 
general opinion" -- he stated that what Spain demands is "a 
process of ethical and political regeneration," and that it 
needs to calm down and regain confidence in its institutions. 
  In his opinion, this can be achieved "because we live in a 
democratic society with all the necessary means for emerging 
from the mire into which you have plunged it. Under democracy, 
the citizens always have the last word, and, make no mistake 
about it, the people, who angrily observe the degrading 
spectacle of this government, will know how to use the polls to 
express unequivocally what they want. The Spanish people will 
soon have an opportunity to make their views known. Let us give 
them their say." 
  In a tough tone, much applauded from the seats of his party, 
which even gave him a standing ovation at the end of his speech, 
and booed from the Socialist seats, the People's Party [PP] 
chairman expressed in the debate held in the Congress in Felipe 
Gonzalez' presence his conviction that there was government 
connivance in Roldan's escape because "all that we know is that 
you believed, for reasons that I prefer not to imagine, that the 
best thing was to leave him at large, while you looked the other 
way," and again attributed the greatest responsibility for the 
corruption cases to Gonzalez himself, among other things, in not 
allowing [Deputy Prime Minister] Serra's appearance before the 
Roldan committee. 
  But the criticisms concerned not only the prime minister but 
also the nationalists supporting him, of whom he said that "they 
show him the steps he should take and excuse him from 
legitimizing his position in this house in return for a 
legitimization by telephone. It is they who have a hold over 
him." This support led him to say that it should be asked who 
is in charge in this country, and whether Gonzalez is "the right 
interlocutor, or whether it would be more effective to pick up 
that telephone through which they send him the assurances and 
instructions." However, in Jose Maria Aznar's opinion, this 
support does not give the government stability because "you 
people are experiencing the uncertainties of Damocles, waiting 
for another photocopy to fall on you," and without resolving 
anything, since all that he [Gonzalez] does is "drop his 
intimate associates to save his own position." 
  In this connection, he referred to the reports published 
yesterday linking Serra with Roldan, and stated that "if what 
has been published is correct, we could guess why he appointed 
Mr. Roldan, why he protected him, and perhaps why he escaped. 
Because he was Mr. Serra's intimate and protege." 
  In order to support his arguments, the People's Party 
chairman referred to headlines in foreign newspapers over the 
past few days, which he summed up with the remark: "Never was 
there greater brazenness; he [Gonzalez] stands his ground and 
defies us," adding that what worries him [Aznar] is "that his 
image may contaminate the post he holds and that he can say 
those things as Spanish prime minister." 
  Aznar denied that Gonzalez has any chance of guaranteeing 
stability and combating corruption, "because you have 
facilitated the task of the corrupt; you are a hostage of your 
own past and, to cap it all, you allow Mr. Roldan to escape. 
Your part has been passivity, obstruction, and negligence, 
thinking not of Spain, the government, or the economic 
situation, but of yourself and saving your face," because, Aznar 
said, "you are threatened by a fugitive from justice who cannot 
be found, you are threatened by foreign investors, and you are 
constrained by your parliamentary allies, who dictate to you the 
resignations and even order your appearances. Spain is being 
governed by those who are constantly afraid that somebody may 
talk too much."

  [Text] Brussels, May 17 (AFP) -- The European Union is 
facing a "crisis of growth" as it wrestles with the problems of 
incorporating new members, Jacques Delors, president of the EU's 
executive European Commission, said here Tuesday [17 May]. 
  He was addressing the newly-formed Committee of the Regions, 
a body formed under the EU's Maastricht Treaty to give local 
communities a voice in Brussels. 
  "How do we extend our values of peace and mutual recognition 
to all the countries of Europe while still retaining the goal of 
a united community?" Delors asked. 
  He called for a fundamental reform of EU institutions after 
the union's planned expansion to take in Austria, Finland, 
Norway and Sweden next year. 
  The EU has scheduled a conference in 1996 to streamline its 
functions with a view to ensuring that expansion will not weaken 
its capacity to take quick and effective decisions and actions. 
  Delors warned against the "easy" option" of an infinitely 
elastic EU, and was critical of German pressure to absorb the 
new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe into the union. 
  The EU would have to double its annual budget -- currently 
at 
about 73 billion ECU (84 billion dollars) -- if Hungary, Poland, 
the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania and Bulgaria were to 
join, he said. 
  Germans should make their own calculations about how this 
would translate into higher taxes, he added.
