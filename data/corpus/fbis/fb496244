<F P=106> [Statistical Communique on 1993 Educational Development] </F>
  [Text] In 1993, the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council promulgated the "Outline Program for the Reform and 
Development of Education in China," a blueprint for building a 
socialist education system with Chinese characteristics. Then, 
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress 
approved the "Teachers' Law of the People's Republic China," 
which put the construction of China's teacher contingent under 
the legal system. Later, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Committee adopted the "Decision on Some Issues Concerning 
the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure," 
which further outlined the direction of our educational reform 
and development. The promulgation and implementation of the 
above principle, policy, and law have instilled new vitality 
into our education work and effectively propelled the 
development of education projects in all fields and at all 
levels. At the same time, some questions have also appeared and 
deserve our attention. 
<H5>  Basic Education </H5>
  1. Steady progress in popularizing nine-year compulsory 
education. 
  Since the "Compulsory Education Law of the People's 
Republic of China" was promulgated in 1986, elementary education 
has been popularized in most parts of the country. In big cities 
and some economically developed areas, efforts are being made to 
popularize junior high school education. To further promote the 
nine-year compulsory education throughout the country, the State 
Education Commission has instituted a "two basic" (basically 
popularizing the nine-year compulsory education and basically 
wiping out illiteracy among middle-aged and young people) 
appraisal system. Up to now, 26 provinces, autonomous regions, 
and municipalities have conducted such "two basic" appraisals 
covering some 350 counties (cities and districts). Meanwhile, 
continued efforts have been made to popularize compulsory 
education at the elementary school level. In 1993, our country 
had 697,000 elementary schools. Students admitted to the schools 
that year numbered 23,534,800, up by 1,702,800 from the 
preceding year. The total enrollment was 124,212,400 million, 
surpassing the preceding year by 2,199,600 million. Of the 
school-age children around the country, 97.7 percent were 
attending schools (covering different school ages and school 
systems in various localities). This was 0.5 percentage points 
higher than the preceding year. The percentage of elementary 
school graduates attending junior high schools reached 81.8 
percent, up 2.1 percentage points compared with the preceding 
year. Compulsory education at the junior high school level also 
showed a certain degree of development. In 1993, there were 
68,415 regular junior high schools across the country. The 
number of new students enrolled that year was 14,789,400 
million, surpassing the preceding year by 139,300. The junior 
high schools had a total enrollment of 40,822,000 million, up by 
162,900 compared with the preceding year. In addition, there 
were 1,582 vocational junior high schools. New students enrolled 
in 1993 numbered 266,500, and the total enrollment was 562,400, 
roughly the same as a year ago. The gross rate of children 
attending junior high schools was 73 percent, or 1.2 percentage 
points higher than the preceding year. The percentage of junior 
high school graduates going to senior high schools was 44.1 
percent, an increase of 9.7 percentage points above the 
preceding year's record. 
  2. Regular senior high school education continued to decline 
in scale. 
  In 1993, our country had 14,380 regular senior high 
schools, less than the preceding year's number by 470. New 
students admitted to these schools totaled 2,283,400 million, 
down by 63,900 compared with the preceding year. The total 
enrollment was 6,569,100 million, showing a drop of 479,800 from 
the preceding year. 
  3. Relatively big progress in developing special and 
preschool education. 
  In 1993, our country had 1,123 special education schools, 
96 more than the preceding year. New students admitted to the 
special education schools in 1993 reached 33,500, surpassing the 
preceding year by 4,000. The students studying in these schools 
totaled 168,600, up by 39,100 over the preceding year. There 
were 165,200 kindergarten across the country with a total 
enrollment of 25,525,400 million. The enrollment was 1,243,300 
million more than the preceding year's record. 
  4. Increased number and better quality of teachers of high 
and elementary schools. 
  In 1993, there were 3.1668 teachers in the regular high 
schools (including junior and senior high schools) throughout 
the country, 20,700 more than the preceding year. Elementary 
school teachers totaled 5,551,800 million, or 25,300 more than 
the preceding year. Among high and elementary school teachers, 
the percentage of those with qualified educational backgrounds 
was on the rise. Among senior high school teachers, the 
percentage was 51.1 percent, or two percentage points higher 
than the preceding year. In the case of junior high school 
teachers, it was 59.5 percent, or 3.9 percentage points higher 
than the preceding year. As for elementary school teachers, it 
was 84.7 percent, or two percentage points higher than the 
preceding year. With regard to the percentage of teachers with 
professional teaching backgrounds, it was as high as 90 percent 
for senior high school teachers, surpassing the preceding year 
by four percentage points. The percentage was 81 percent for 
junior high school teachers, three percentage points higher than 
the preceding year, and 83 percent for elementary school 
teachers, two percentage points higher than the preceding year. 
The percentages of high-grade and first-rate teachers in senior 
and junior high schools and elementary schools were 42.18, 
18.71, and 11.88 percent respectively. Compared with the 
preceding year, these were up, respectively, by 3, 1.6, and 1.5 
percentage points. 
  5. Arduous task in popularizing junior high education. 
  On the whole, since the Decision on the Reform of the 
Educational System was promulgated in 1985, our country's basic 
education has developed well, and relatively big progress has 
been made in popularizing the nine-year compulsory education. 
Now, the percentage of elementary school-age children attending 
schools has increased each year, and elementary education has 
been basically popularized in most localities. However, 
development of junior high school education is still at a slow 
pace. For many years, the number of students at junior high 
schools has remained at the same level--around 40 million. To 
meet the target of 55 million junior high school students by the 
end of this century, we must gear up our efforts. In 1993, the 
gross rate of students attending junior high schools was only 73 
percent, well below the target rate. Moreover, the dropout rate 
in junior high schools continued to rise in the last two 
years--5.8 percent in 1992 and 7.1 percent in 1993. Among junior 
high school teachers, only 59.5 percent had qualified 
educational backgrounds, while high-grade and first-rate 
teachers accounted for only 18.7 percent, less than one-half of 
the percentage in senior high schools. Because of this, 
strengthening junior high education and striving to increase the 
rate of students attending junior high schools should be 
considered a key to achieving the "two basic" objectives in 
developing education. 
  6. Inadequate funds and other conditions for developing 
elementary and high schools. 
  The last few years have witnessed an acute shortage of 
funds for developing education. The part of public funds used in 
running schools has declined each year. Particular noteworthy is 
that, in many provinces and autonomous regions, elementary and 
high schools are unable to pay their teachers on time. With 
regard to the renovation and construction of school buildings, 
elementary and high schools have by and large met the target of 
"one no and two have" (no school has a dilapidated building; 
every grade has a classroom, and every student has a desk and a 
chair) in recent years, thanks to the efforts made to raise 
funds from various sources to meet the schools' needs. In 1993, 
the percentage of dilapidated buildings in elementary and high 
schools nationwide showed a slight decline to 1.96 percent from 
the preceding year's 1.97 percent. However, the percentage in 
rural areas began to pick up--it was 2.19 percent in 1992 but 
rose to 2.27 percent in 1993. 
<H5>  Vocational and Technical Education </H5>
  1. Considerable progress of secondary vocational and 
technical education. 
  Under the impact of the State Council's "Resolution on 
Vigorous Development of Vocational and Technical Education," 
education in this field has shown considerable development. In 
1993, there were 16,842 vocational and technical schools of 
various kinds equivalent to the level of senior high schools. 
This number was 280 more than the preceding year. A total of 
3.1612 million students were admitted to these schools in 1993, 
surpassing the preceding year's record by 725,600. The total 
enrollment reached 7.623 million, showing an increase of 795,000 
over the preceding year. The proportion of such students to the 
total number of students at the senior high school level reached 
53 percent as against 49 percent in 1992, meeting ahead of 
schedule the target set in the above-mentioned resolution. 
  2. Rapid development of ordinary specialized secondary 
schools 
  In 1993, the number of ordinary specialized secondary 
schools reached 3,964, an increase of 61 compared with the 
preceding year. The number of students admitted to these schools 
that year was 1.1489 million, an increase of 269,700, or 30.7 
percent, over the preceding year. The schools had a total of 
2,820,300 students. This was 411,900 more than the preceding 
year's figure. 
  Changes are noted in the specialties chosen by new 
students. Numbers of students of finance and economics, physical 
education, and arts were on the rise, while there was a downward 
trend of students choosing engineering as their major. Among the 
new students, those majoring in finance and economics increased 
sharply. Of the above-mentioned 269,700 additional new students, 
95,000 were finance and economics majors, accounting for 35 
percent. 
  3. Considerable progress in developing vocational secondary 
schools 
  In 1993, our country had 8,430 vocational senior high 
schools, 136 more than the preceding year. New students admitted 
to these schools numbered 1,348,800, an increase of 208,800 over 
the preceding year, while the total enrollment was 3,063,500 
million, up by 199,700. 
  4. Skilled worker training school took in more students 
  In 1993, the number of schools for training skilled 
workers reached 4,477, an increase of 85 from the preceding 
year. New students admitted to these schools numbered 663,500, 
up by 61,700 compared with the preceding year. The total number 
of students was 1.739 million, surpassing the preceding year by 
183,000. 
<H5>  Regular Higher Education </H5>
  1. A sharp increase in students attending regular 
institutions of higher education. 
  Students admitted to regular institutions of higher 
education continued to increase in the past two years, the 
magnitude of increase each year being more than 20 percent. In 
1993, the number of regular institutions of higher education 
reached 1,065, up by 12 over the preceding year. Students 
admitted to regular and special colleges numbered 924,000, 
surpassing the preceding year by 170,000 or an increase of 22.5 
percent. The total number of students was 2.5355 million, up by 
351,100, or 16.1 percent over the preceding year. Students 
admitted to graduate schools totaled 42,100, surpassing the 
preceding year by 8,700 or 26 percent. Of the new students, 
6,200 were studying for doctorate, and 35,700 for the master's 
degree. Graduate school students totaled 106,800, showing an 
increase of 12,600, or 13.4 percent, compared with the preceding 
year. They included 17,600 students studying for doctorate and 
88,800 for the master's degree. 
  2. A further increase in students under the entrusted 
training program and students paying their own tuition. 
  While the state mandatory plan remained stable with 
respect to enrollment of students, there was a rapid increase in 
the students enrolled under the state regulatory plan. Of the 
new students admitted to institutions of higher education, 
561,000, or 60.7 percent, came under the state mandatory plan. 
This was 12.26 percentage points less than the preceding year. 
Those under the entrusted training program and those paying 
their own tuition totaled 360,200. They accounted for 39 percent 
of the new students, up 12.31 percentage points over the 
preceding year. Of the total number of students, 1,926,500, or 
75.98 percent, were under the state mandatory plan, down by 9.09 
percentage points compared with the preceding year, and 603,700, 
or 23.81 percent, were students under the entrusted training 
program or were tuition-paying students, up by 9.64 percentage 
points. 
  3. Changes in proportions of students at different levels 
and 
of different majors. 
  With the increase in the students admitted to institutions 
of higher education, there was a change in the proportions of 
graduate students, undergraduates, and students studying in 
regular and special colleges. Newly enrolled graduate students 
and undergraduates were in the ratio of 1:25.9 as against 1:25.4 
in the preceding year. Of the newly enrolled undergraduates, the 
ratio of students studying in regular colleges to those in 
special colleges increased to 1:1.16 from the preceding year's 
1:1.39. 
  The change in the majors of newly enrolled students was 
that there were more students majoring in liberal arts, finance 
and economics, politics and law, physical education, and various 
fields of arts. The percentage of new students majoring in 
finance and economics increased by 3.16 percentage points over 
the preceding year. A downward trend is noted in the percentage 
of students majoring in science and engineering. 
  4. Inadequate facilities for operation of institutes of 
higher education. 
  With the rapid development of higher education, some 
noteworthy problems have cropped up: The imbalance between 
investment and development became further intensified. The 
problem of inadequate facilities for conducting higher education 
was even more pronounced than before. A further decline is noted 
in both the students' living conditions and the schools' 
teaching facilities. An increased number of schools had 
inadequate facilities to meet the requirements for conducting 
higher education. In regular institutions of higher education, 
the average campus building space per student dropped to 42.4 
square meters from the preceding year's 46.7 square meters. Some 
schools had insufficient dormitory space for their students. The 
average dormitory space per student in regular institutions of 
higher education declined to 6.2 square meters from 7.2 square 
meters in the preceding year. Another problem was that some 
schools were seriously short of laboratory equipment for 
education and research. 
<H5>  Adult Education </H5>
  1. Rapid development of certificate-awarding higher 
education 
for adults. 
  After several years' curtailment of its scale, 
certificate-awarding higher education for adults began to show 
fast development in 1992. In 1993, there were 1,183 institutions 
of higher education for adults, a drop of 15 from the number in 
the preceding year. In addition, 796 regular institutions of 
higher education had correspondence courses and night schools 
for adults. New students enrolled in adult institutions and 
schools (including radio and TV universities, correspondence 
schools, and night universities) totaled 862,700, an increase of 
271,000, or 45.8 percent, over the preceding year. Total number 
of adult students was 1,862,900 (including 131,000 students of 
radio and TV universities and correspondence courses), an 
increase of 384,200. Of all institutions of higher education for 
adults, management cadre colleges and radio and TV universities 
showed the fastest increase in enrollment. The new students 
admitted to these two categories of schools increased from 
30,000 and 145,800 in 1992 to 59,600 and 213,300 in 1993, up 
98.7 and 46.3 percent respectively. 
  2. Changes in specialties of certificate-awarding higher 
education for adults. 
  There was an increase in the percentage of adult students 
admitted to schools of finance and economics, politics and law, 
science, and medicine. New students majoring in finance and 
economics showed the fastest increase. Their percentage was 6.73 
percentage points higher than the preceding year. Students 
admitted to normal colleges declined by 4.12 percentage points. 
  3. Less students taking non-certificate-awarding courses run 
by institutions of higher education for adults. 
  There was a decline in the number of students taking 
non-certificate-awarding courses (exclusive of seminars giving 
professional certificates) run by institutions of higher 
education for adults. In 1993, 1,567,200 million adults finished 
such courses, down by 204,000, or 11.59 percent, from the 
preceding year. Those taking on-the-job-training courses showed 
a remarkable 23.3 percent decline from the preceding year. 
  4. Further development of elementary and secondary technical 
education for adults. 
  In recent years, the number of elementary and secondary 
technical schools for adults, mostly farmers, has been on the 
rise. In 1993 the number of adult technical schools throughout 
the country increased to 298,300, or 14,200 more than the 
preceding year. As many as 57,068,000 million people attended 
these schools and graduated, showing an increase of 7,482,900 
million above the preceding year. Of these schools, 288,500 were 
technical schools for farmers, 17,000 more than the number a 
year ago. The number of graduates from these schools reached 
52,814,600 million, or 8,213,600 more than the preceding year. 
Farmers attending such technical schools accounted for 12.2 
percent of the total rural labor force, up 1.8 percentage points 
compared with the preceding year. Throughout the country, 30.7 
percent of the townships and 81.1 percent of the villages had 
technical schools for farmers. Meanwhile, there were 9,800 
technical training schools for staff members and workers. This 
number was 2,800 less than the preceding year. The number of 
graduates totaled 4,253,400 million, down by 730,700 from the 
preceding year. 
  Secondary specialized schools for adults, mainly staff 
members and workers, showed a certain degree of development. The 
number of such schools reached 4,783. This was seven more than 
the number a year ago. New students admitted to the schools 
numbered 856,700, or 143,600 more than the preceding year. The 
total enrollment was 2,067,600 million, an increase of 323,300 
over the preceding year. 
  5. Relatively quick development noted in conducting special 
examinations at higher and secondary levels for self-study 
students. 
  In 1993, nationwide examinations for self-study students 
at higher education level were held for 142 specialties. This 
was 11 more than the preceding year. A total of 4,838,100 
million people took part in the examinations. Of them, 127,100 
passed the examinations. In addition, 15,100 passed the 
examinations equivalent to the level of secondary specialized 
schools. In 1993, some professional-qualification examinations 
were also held for those who had completed 
non-certificate-awarding education courses. 
  6. Upwards of 5 million illiterates educated in three years. 
  In 1993, there were 106,400 literacy schools (classes) 
across the country. This was 5,000 less than the preceding year. 
A total of 5,481,700 million people attended the schools 
(classes) and graduated, showing an increase of 248,600 over the 
preceding year. The efforts over the past three years benefitted 
more than 5 million illiterates, and each year the plan for 
wiping out illiteracy was overfulfilled.

<F P=106> [Article by Quan Pengfei (2938 7720 7378): "Children at the </F>
Junction"] 
  [Text] In some areas in southern Xinjiang, runaway school 
children has long been a problem without a solution. I went to 
Pishan County's Keketiereke Township and saw the silhouette of a 
small child herding sheep on the Gobi sands and witnessed other 
children selling food and drinks in the restaurants. I became 
very depressed. 
  On a fiercely hot day last September, the township party 
committee vice secretary Yang Yaorong [2799 5069 2837] and two 
of the village cadres spent almost a day "grabbing" 12 students 
and taking them back to the schools; they were all hot and 
sweaty. When they got to the section of the village road where 
corn grew tall and dense on both sides, suddenly there was a 
whistle, and the naughty children scattered. The quick and agile 
ones disappeared among the bushes; only three scared little 
girls did not run off. They just sat there and cried. They would 
rather die than go back to school. 
  Since 1981, the township's 19 schools have yet to complete 
their enrollment plans. The middle school enrollment rate is 
below 50 percent. Where are the children who should be attending 
school? 
  In the bazha [1572 2089], one often hears the young voices 
of 
children in the restaurants and shops selling goods and calling 
out. They look only 12-13 years old. On the road to town, those 
driving the mule carts selling kindling and livestock are almost 
all children. 
  Why aren't these children attending school? What are their 
parents thinking? 
  Most peasants believe that so long as their children can 
read 
a few words and do some simple arithmetic, it is good enough. As 
for going to school to become workers and cadres, they don't 
even dare to dream. As a result, young people who should be 
keeping company with books and knowledge are keeping company 
with sheep and mules. At one time, poverty brought nothing but 
misery and sorrow to the people around here. People long to be 
rich. Their desire to make money keep them very busy, so busy 
that they drag their little boys and little girls, who have no 
interest in learning anyway, down with them. 
  It is difficult to recruit students and even more difficult 
to reinforce them and keep them there. The township recruited a 
class of 30 first-year middle school students last year; 11 did 
not show up after registration, and 12 dropped out later for 
various reasons. The township tried a new measure to counter the 
recruitment problem a couple years ago: Each household had to 
guarantee sending one student to school; they were rewarded with 
one year of free service plus 30 yuan; those who did not comply 
would be fined one year's free service plus 30 yuan. When that 
measure was first implemented, it helped, but it did not take 
long for the peasants to figure things out: One child could 
raise five sheep in a year, and if they fined me one sheep, I 
would still have four, not to mention their dung for fertilizer; 
I would still come out ahead work even with the fine. Later, as 
the voice of "easing the peasants' burdens" grew louder and 
louder, the village had no choice but to abolish its "local 
policy," and enrollment dropped again. 
  The ultimate goal of education is to improve the nation's 
overall quality so that people can escape ignorance and poverty 
and embark on the road to civilization and wealth. But to an 
ordinary peasant who is so sick and tired of being poor and who 
does not even have the most basic guarantees of survival, what 
good is education? In my opinion, to keep education from 
slipping away in these backward regions, besides continuing to 
strengthen guidance and increase input, perhaps we should change 
the area's existing mold of "pure education" to "quality 
education" that is more compatible with the realistic local 
conditions, so that the students can directly serve the village 
economy and social development as soon as they leave school.

Xinjiang CPPCC member: "Conscientiously Protect the Rights of 
the Young"] 
  [Text] CYL organizations at all levels in the Xinjiang 
Autonomous Region have done much solid work to represent and 
protect the legal rights of young people and to promote the 
healthy development of the juveniles, but there are still many 
problems in these area, and in particular, things that 
jeopardize the physical and mental well-being of the young are 
still happening frequently. 
  On the matter of infringement of the juvenile's legal rights 
in marriage and family life, it is our opinion that the public 
security organs and the judicial departments should put more 
force on cracking down quickly and severely on the criminal 
activities that seriously harm the young people. Party and 
government departments throughout the region and the mass 
organizations should emphasize educating the parents of underage 
children about the law, so that they are more aware of the laws. 
Legal, administrative, and economic measures should be applied 
in accordance to the law when parents fail to fulfill their 
responsibilities. This is to make sure that the legal rights of 
the young are not violated. Families, schools, and society 
should work together to take up the responsibility and form a 
multi-channel, multi-level, all-encompassing protective network. 
  On the questions of child-labor and using children to peddle 
goods, it is our opinion that to solve those problems we must 
first focus on family protection. CLY organizations at all 
levels and the education department must work very closely 
together to continue to "persuade the middle and elementary 
students to go back to school" and actively implement "Project 
Hope" to bring many school children back to the school grounds. 
We suggest that Xinjiang's People's Congress take the lead and 
work with the education and judicial and relevant departments to 
conduct a special study once a year on the issues of child-labor 
and child-merchants. 
  On the issue of juvenile crimes, first, we must comply with 
the autonomous region's "Juvenile Protection Act" and other 
appropriate laws and regulations to give the young more 
protection. Second, we must focus on the young people's moral 
education and strengthen the school's political ideology work. 
Families, schools, and society should show concern for the young 
people and share the responsibility of nurturing and educating 
the next generation. Third, we must do a good comprehensive job 
with regard to maintaining public security and active prevention 
of juvenile crimes. Lastly, we suggest that the autonomous 
region build a youth convalescence center or drug rehabilitation 
center. 
  On the issue of the cultural market, first, the building of 
youth activities centers should be included in the social 
development plans. Second, the public security, industrial and 
commercial, cultural, and CYL and other departments should join 
together to sort out the cultural markets and implement regular 
administration. Third, "wipe out pornography" and "crack down on 
crimes" should continue, but more important is that we should 
encourage the young people and children's cultural creativity. 
Fourth, we should continue to work on prohibiting children from 
entering certain premises by posting signs.

<F P=106> [Article by Zou Huixian (6760 2264 0341), member of Xinjiang </F>
Autonomous Region CPPCC Standing Committee: "Optimize the Social 
Environment for Women"] 
  [Text] In Xinjiang, the leaders, to different extents, are 
not putting enough emphasis on the dissemination and 
implementation of the "Protection of Women's Rights Act," and 
the relevant departments are not vigorously cooperating with one 
another. The main reason is that in some comrades' opinion, "the 
`Women's Act' is a woman's act, and all that is needed is for 
the women to get together and work on it." Within the party and 
government leading groups, the lack of woman leaders is clearly 
a problem. Violation of women's rights is still a fairly serious 
problem. In the market place, money worship has enticed some 
people to turn women into a commodity. 
  According to Article 4 of the "Women's Act," the provincial, 
municipal, and autonomous region people's governments must set 
up organs to protect women's rights. Xinjiang has set up a 
protection group under the Women and Children Work Committee to 
coordinate with various departments on protecting women's 
rights. The departments must fulfill their own responsibilities 
and seize this task. The "Women's Act" has given the protection 
of women's rights an extensive legal scope, which is very 
important. But practice has proved that without a clear and 
detailed program that is compatible with Xinjiang's own 
characteristics, women's rights still do not have the legal 
protection they deserve with regard to many specific issues. 
Xinjiang's People's Congress has decided to include the 
promulgation of detailed rules to implement the "Women's Act" in 
the 1994 legislative plan. Personnel has been selected and 
transferred from the People's Congress and Women's Federation, 
and the investigating and drafting work will begin soon. It is 
hoped that Xinjiang's people's government will provide the 
necessary funding and support so guarantee the success of this 
endeavor. 
  It is suggested that party committees at all levels elect 
more woman cadres to the next level party schools or lower the 
requirements for further studies at the relevant colleges so as 
to provide more opportunities for women to make progress and 
move up. Effective measures should be taken to put more 
qualified woman cadres in leadership positions. 
  It is suggested that we take advantage of the Fourth World 
Women's Conference to once again give publicity to the "Women's 
Act" to help expedite its implementation. We must enforce the 
law strictly and prosecute and punish harshly all criminal acts 
in society that violate women's rights or cause bodily harm to 
women. 
  Prostitution and other sexual services and other ugly and 
evil phenomena poison the soul and corrode the body of our 
society; they are the root causes of many evils. I urge the 
people's governments at all levels and the public security, the 
political and law, the judicial and other relevant departments 
to make the task of eradicating this "social evil" a part of 
their comprehensive administrative responsibility, and I urge 
them to strengthen control, enforce the law stringently, and 
emphasize both prosecution and prohibition, so as to guarantee 
results.

<F P=106> [Article by Chung T'ing-yao (6988 1656 5069), Researcher, </F>
Social Science Research Center, University of Hong Kong] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Several days ago the Social 
Science Research Center of the University of Hong Kong published 
the results of all previous 1993 marks given to the Hong Kong 
governor, legislative councilors and political groups. This was 
the first part of a 1993 overall summary. A second section 
concerning the degree of trust in the Chinese, British and Hong 
Kong governments, and a survey of residents' confidence in the 
future will be made public hereafter. To evaluate Hong Kong 
Governor Patten, surveys basically were undertaken once per 
week; in 1993, 50 surveys were taken in which more than 28,600 
people successfully were interviewed. The average grade given to 
the Hong Kong governor was 57.99. Regarding legislative 
councilors and political groups, a survey was made once every 
two months. Some 3,385 people were interviewed for the former 
and 3,271 people for the latter. [passage omitted] 
  Summarizing residents' degree of support for the Hong Kong 
governor, as of the latter half of 1993, the degree of support 
was fixed at around 57 points, with less fluctuation than in 
1992, indicating that residents' appraisal of Hong Kong Governor 
Patten himself has begun to finalize. There were two rather 
large fluctuations in 1993; in March there was one jump after 
publication of the political reform plan statutes. In October 
there was a seven percent rise after reading out the second 
administrative report. Thereafter a recovery to normal levels 
was seen. 
  An analysis of the grades given to Patten finds them 
average. 
In 1992, they rose to a height of 65 points, about the same as 
before Wei T'u-hsin left office. The highest score given to the 
top 10 Legislative Council [Legco] members was around 65 points. 
If we compare the marks given to Legco Members to those received 
by the Hong Kong governor, Patten only comes in at around sixth 
place. From this one can see that evaluations of the Hong Kong 
governor himself are only average. [passage omitted] 
  Regarding residents' appraisals of the 10 most familiar 
major 
Legco members, Tu Yeh Hsi-en still holds first place, Liu 
Hui-ch'ing second, Liu Ch'ien-shih is often in third or fourth. 
The others, such as Li Chu-ming, Chou Liang Shu-ch'ia, Si-tu 
Hua, Huang Hung-fa and Li P'eng-fei are all on the list. Tu 
Yao-tsung has been on the list for nearly one-half a year now. 
Regarding degrees of recognition, the top 10 Legco members are 
all recognized by about 70 percent to 80 percent of residents, 
about 20 percent higher than the political groups, indicating 
that more residents recognize Legco members than political 
groups. 
  Analyzing the marks received by various political parties 
and 
groups, the Hong Kong Alliance still occupies first place, the 
Hui Tien second, and for nearly one-half year now the Freedom 
Party and Workers Union have vied for third and fourth place. 
Fifth place is contended for by the Min-chien Lien and the 
Tsu-Min Lien. It is noteworthy that the marks political parties 
received were generally lower than those received by Legco 
members, indicating that residents still have rather low 
knowledge of political parties. However, they are somewhat 
better known than at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by the Hong Kong Urban Engineering Institute, </F>
Baptist Institute, and Study Friendship Society (Xueyou She)] 
  [Excerpts] Those concerned at the Hong Kong City 
Engineering Institute, the Baptist Institute, and the Study 
Friendship Society recently did a study of citizenship education 
entitled "The Political Transition Period in Hong Kong: 
Political Attitudes of Senior High School Students." [passage 
omitted] 
  Approximately 50 percent of senior high school students 
support direct elections to all levels of the Legislative 
Council and Legislative Council members: 1994 regional 
legislative councils (53 percent), 1995 municipal and regional 
councils (51 percent) and 1995 Legislative Council bureaus (48 
percent); however, 30 percent of those interviewed had no 
opinion. When calculated on a scale from zero to one hundred, 
(where zero represents all disagree strongly and 100 represents 
all agree strongly), a rather low 62 points of students gave 
average support for third-level Legislative Council direct 
elections. Originally, it was generally thought students were 
rather idealized; therefore, 62-point support was quite far from 
our predictions. More students born in Hong Kong support direct 
elections (by five points) than those born in China. 
Statistically, this is a notable difference, indicating that 
cultural and attitudinal factors affect whether senior high 
school students support direct elections. [passage omitted] 
  Although 38 percent of senior high school students agree 
that 
"the Basic Law can ensure rule by law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region after 1997" and 50 percent agree "one 
country with two systems in Hong Kong is feasible." 
Nevertheless, less than one-third of senior high school students 
agree that "the government in Beijing respects the Sino-British 
Joint Accord" (29 percent) and "will respect the Basic Law" (28 
percent). On a zero to 100 scale, the average value of 
confidence in China's promises by those interviewed was 51. More 
students born in China (by eight points) than in Hong Kong 
believe China's promises. Likewise, this is a statistically 
significant difference. From this it can be seen that senior 
high school students' differing opinions regarding support of 
direct elections and confidence in China's promises are related 
to place of birth. [passage omitted] 
  Approximately 50 percent of those interviewed agree "if a 
communist desires to publish a speech supporting communism, he 
should be allowed to do so" ( 49 percent) and "when a communist 
is elected legally as a Hong Kong Legislative Council member, 
the residents of Hong Kong should allow him to hold office" (51 
percent). The Hong Kong government has promoted citizenship 
education for eight years now. Surprisingly, only 60 percent of 
those interviewed agree "minorities should have the freedom to 
criticize majority decisions." Senior high school students' 
average political leniency value was 60 on a zero to 100 scale, 
which is rather low. The concepts of freedom and democracy in 
middle-school education are not broadly accepted by senior 
high-school students. [passage omitted] 
  Some 30 percent of senior high school students oppose 
lowering the voting age to 18 years; 25 percent had no opinion 
and 45 percent agreed. Comparatively speaking, the senior high 
school students who disagreed were mainly females or those 18 
years and older. As expected, they have no intention of 
registering to vote or casting ballots in the 1995 elections. 
The aforementioned results indicate that citizenship education 
has not been effectively promoted among senior high school 
students, or else perhaps the students were unable to accept 
sufficient citizenry education training as expected. [passage 
omitted] 
  Senior high school students will vote for Legislative 
Council 
members according to the following factors: Record of past 
experience (87 percent), political affiliation (86 percent), 
degree of education (78 percent), professional qualifications 
(73 percent), political party background (56 percent), eloquence 
(41 percent), relationship to China (40 percent), age (36 
percent), glamour and looks (13 percent), and sex (nine 
percent). Senior high school students pay relatively greater 
attention to the first four "rational factors" in voting for 
Legco members. A "candidate's inclinations" and "inclinations 
towards matters" more strongly influence students' voter 
behavior rather than "political party inclination." [passage 
omitted] 
  Some 69 percent of those interviewed indicated that if they 
were qualified to vote in the 1995 elections, they would 
register to vote in the 1995 Legco elections; 75 percent of them 
indicated that if they register to vote in the 1995 Legco 
elections, they will do so. If we subtract the influence of the 
"social desirability effect," fewer will actually register to 
vote and cast ballots. This brings up the old issue of how to 
turn intention to vote into actual voting in the Hong Kong 
environment. Although the older the senior high school student, 
the relatively greater the indication to register to vote and 
cast a ballot, but the relationships therein are not so clear. 
School seniority has a positively clear influence: Those 
interviewed of higher seniority comparatively tend to register 
and vote. Other social and cultural factors such as sex, place 
of birth, religious beliefs and family income had no significant 
influence. [passage omitted] 
  Hong Kong senior high school students lack confidence in the 
Chinese Government, engendering rather low political tolerance. 
Rather low political tolerance is unfavorable to promote 
democracy in society. Their low support for direct elections and 
a lower voting age reflects insufficient citizenship education 
in school. On the contrary, they indicate a rational side to 
voting for Legislative Council members. They have appropriate 
support for registering to vote and casting ballots. In the 
future 1994 and 1995 elections, this group of new electorates 
can be seen as politically conservative. They will not be 
aroused by those political parties who try to please the public 
with claptrap. [passage omitted]

Japan for 1994"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  III. New Adjustments Brewing in Japan's Foreign Affairs </H5>
  With the world quickening its pace toward multipolarity, 
disputes in Japan over its strategy for national development 
will become fiercer than ever before. Right now, Japan's basic 
line for its foreign affairs is to continue its readjustments 
and seek changes while holding its ground so as to keep pace 
with the changes of its external environment which have taken 
place after the Seattle meeting. Due to the fact that 
readjustments in its diplomacy are often affected by its 
domestic affairs, it is possible Japan may delay or hesitate in 
taking action. 
  1. Create an internal and external environment, pave the way 
to becoming a powerful nation in political affairs. 
  Since Hosokawa took his office, Japan adopted the tactics of 
making concessions to gain advantages on the issue of becoming a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council. Japan attached 
importance to "being recommended by other nations" rather than 
fighting for this membership and taking the initiative by 
itself. As for the international environment, Japan believes 
that the conditions for Japan to become a permanent member of 
the UN Security Council have become ripe in each passing day. 
Its next move will be to win popular support at home, while 
trying to skirt around the barrier of "amending its 
Constitution." In foreign affairs, it will launch another round 
of offense with emphasis on becoming the fifth permanent member 
of the UN Security Council and try to win more votes from 
developing nations. 
  2. Exert greater efforts in promoting "Asian Diplomacy," and 
expand Japan's economic interests and political influence in 
Asia. In view of its increasing economic dependence on Asia, 
Japan will further try to raise its diplomatic status in Asia in 
coordination with its domestic economic structural readjustment; 
turn the Asia-Pacific region into its economic backyard and 
diplomatic prop; and strive to gradually play a leading role in 
managing Asia-Pacific affairs. 
  In dealing with Southeast Asia, Japan will "make use of 
economic means to expand its political influence," pave its way 
with the outputs of its capital and merchandise, and develop 
multilateral economic cooperation, while strengthening bilateral 
relations. It will seize the forthcoming opportunity in the 
normalization of U.S.-Vietnamese relations to strengthen its 
infiltration into the Vietnamese market, advocate unified 
actions to help Cambodia develop post-war reconstruction 
projects, and expand its influence in Indochina. In dealing with 
Northeast Asia, it will advocate peaceful dialogue; help the 
United States and North Korea solve the nuclear issue with 
peaceful means; try to officialize the dialogue on security 
issues among Japan, the United States and Russia; and set up a 
"regional system for the control of exports of technologies 
which can be used for both military and civilian purposes." 
  3. Readjust its relations with the United States, and 
gradually extricate itself from the situation wherein it 
excessively relies on the United States for its economy and it 
is politically contained by the United States. Within this year, 
Japan and the United States will have their final showdown in 
their "overall economic negotiations." In view of the fact that 
agreements were already reached at the Uruguay Round of Talks, 
the emphasis of U.S. strategy on its economic and security 
matters will be shifted from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific 
Ocean. It is making preparations to start a "Pacific Round of 
Talks for Trading" aimed at opening up the markets in Asia. 
Japan's market will be the first to be affected. The return of 
the United States to Asia will inevitably intensify the 
U.S.-Japanese contention for the leading role in economic 
cooperation in the region. In addition to showing Japan's unique 
status as a link between the United States and the ASEAN nations 
within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), it will try 
to play an even more active role in the East Asian Economic 
Council (EAEC) proposed by Malaysia so as to balance U.S. 
efforts in making use of the APEC Seattle meeting to increase 
its influence in Asia. 
  4. Improve political relations between Japan and Europe, and 
increase the radius in diplomacy. Hosokawa will visit Europe in 
May. He plans to make use of his trip as a turning point to 
strengthen the weaker link of the triangular relations among 
Japan, the United States and Europe, and achieve a balanced 
development. He will try to rely on the Japanese-European mutual 
support to have more say in foreign affairs when he deals with 
the United States. Japan will try to add new contents in the 
"Japan-EC Joint Statement" and raise the bilateral political and 
diplomatic relations between Japan and the European nations in 
the past to the level of Japanese-European cooperation. It will 
try to become a "quasi NATO member nation," and make use of the 
European Union and the European Security Council to "push the 
Japanese-European political cooperation into a new stage" and 
turn this type of cooperation into another strategic pillar in 
Japan's diplomatic structure. 
  5. Strengthen political dialogue between Japan and Russia, 
and create a "soft environment" for the normalization of 
Japanese-Russian relations. In view of the fact that the 
improvement of Japanese-Russian relations will help Japan 
reverse its unfavorable position in the quadrilateral relations 
among Japan, the United States, China and Russia, and improve 
the strategic environment in Northeast Asia, Japan's Foreign 
Minister Hata and Prime Minister Hosokawa plan to visit Russia 
on different occasions in March and May. Japan will reaffirm its 
stand to continuously support Russia's line of reform within the 
framework set up by the group of seven Western nations; 
implement its plan to aid Russia which it had announced before; 
promote bilateral political dialogue; and encourage the exchange 
of visits by leaders of both countries. Meanwhile, Japan will 
continue to carry out negotiations on the issue of Japan's 
Northern Islands and try to pave the way to finally solve the 
problem in the "post-Yeltsin" period. 
<H5>  IV. Japan-China Relations To Enter a New Historic Stage </H5>
  At a time when Japan is changing its political and economic 
system and readjusting its foreign and domestic policies, it 
will duly adjust its strategy toward China. Japan will seek to 
establish a "new-type post-war relation" with China and to 
ensure that the development of the Japan-China relation will not 
be controlled by the United States. It will seek to establish a 
Japan-China relations "in the world" and "in the Asia-Pacific 
region" and maintain an "ordinary relation between one state and 
other" which is not "restrained by history." 
  1. Proceeding from Japan's strategic interests, Japan will 
not change its main foreign policy in maintaining the 
Japan-China relations of friendship and cooperation. Recently 
Hosokawa once again emphatically pointed out that Japan regarded 
the establishment of a "better Japan-China relations toward the 
21st Century" as the basic principle for its China policy. He 
placed the Japan-China relationship on a par with the Japan-U.S. 
relationship, and stressed that both of them are important 
pillars of Japan's diplomacy. 
  In the development of its relations with China, Japan takes 
into consideration the following new factors: 
  A) It takes Japan-China relations as the key for Japan to 
attain the status of a "major nation in political affairs." 
After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Japan-China 
relationship is strategically becoming more and more important 
in Japan's foreign policy. Japan needs China's cooperation to 
hold sway in the new order in the world and in the Asia-pacific 
region. China holds a key vote if Japan is to become a permanent 
member of the UN Security Council. The Japan-China relationship 
is a trump card if Japan wants to raise its strategic diplomatic 
status in dealing with the United States and to seek 
independence in handling foreign affairs. 
  B) Japan regards the Japan-China relationship as an "anchor" 
in stabilizing the situation in Asia. This relationship is a 
necessary condition for the promotion of economic development in 
the Asia-Pacific region. Japan believes that peace, stability 
and security in the Asian-Pacific region are still being 
threatened by various factors even after the cold war ended. 
Without a stable Japan-China relationship, there will be no 
peace in this region. Whether the rapid economic development in 
this region can be maintained or not depends on the economic 
development and cooperation between Japan and China. Japan will 
encounter endless difficulties in promoting its "new Asian 
diplomacy" without China's support. 
  C) Japan seeks to develop the Japan-China relation so as to 
check China's excessive growth which may harm Japan's interests. 
In face of the increasing changes in China and the improved 
relations between China and the United States after the Seattle 
meeting, Japan is worried about the possibility of China and the 
United States joining their efforts to contain Japan. It is for 
this reason that strategically Japan needs to develop its 
relations with China while containing each other. 
  2. Based on the developing situation, Japan is adjusting its 
strategy in dealing with China. 
  First, Japan's strategic ideology has changed from one of 
"allying with China to resist the Soviet Union" in the past to 
one of relying on China's support to stabilize Northeast Asia 
and the Western Pacific Region, and help Japan have more say on 
international affairs and become a major nation in political 
affairs. It is for this purpose that it must attach greater 
importance to the Japan-China relationship in its foreign 
policy, and improve the situation whereas the development of the 
Japan-China relationship is constrained by the United States. 
  Second, the core of Japan's foreign policy has changed from 
economic cooperation to paying equal attention to politic, 
economic and security matters and from bilateral relations to 
cooperative relations of a regional or even world nature. 
  Third, its China policy is to change from a "special 
relationship" to an "ordinary relationship." That means to shake 
off the yoke of historical issues and establish the Japan-China 
relationship on the basis of reciprocity. Meanwhile, in its 
China policy, Japan will stress the need to maintain a balance 
in the triangular relationship among Japan, the United States 
and China, and ensure that the situation is always to Japan's 
advantage. In short, the Japan-China relationship will witness 
new developments in the new year. The two nations will rely on 
each other even more, and they would cooperate with each other 
in more fields. Politically there will be more contacts at the 
high level between the two countries, and a new situation will 
emerge in economic cooperation. There will be more dialogue on 
security matters in the Asia-Pacific Region and bilateral 
security issues. However, with the continuous growth of China's 
overall national strength, there will emerge competitions 
between the two countries. While Japan enlists the support of 
the United States and joins the ASEAN nations to strategically 
contain China and "psychologically hold back China," some of its 
movements merits our attention. 
  A) It stressed the need to achieve an "overall balance" 
between economic cooperation and political security, and played 
economic cards on the issue of politics and security. It 
shortened the credit period of its loans to China so as to 
maintain its influence over China. It imposed many restrictions 
on the use of loans from Japan, the credit period and other 
terms. It linked financial and economic cooperation between the 
two nations with China's national defense modernization program, 
the so-called military sales and the bilateral dialogue on 
security matters. 
  B) Some of the members of Japan's ruling group who advocate 
the establishment of a "quasi-government relation" between Japan 
and Taiwan are gaining ground. Their aim is to safeguard Japan's 
commercial interests in Taiwan and make Japanese products 
economically more competitive. At the same time, they try to 
make use of this to strengthen Japan's containment over China. 
It is reported that Japan is negotiating with Taiwan on how 
Minister of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumatani 
may visit Taiwan, and that it plans to invite Li Denghui to 
visit Japan during the APEC summit meeting in Tokyo in 1995. 
Nevertheless that does not conform with Japan's "one China" 
policy.

<F P=106> [Article by the State Economic and Trade Commission: "Ensure </F>
Success in Stopping Losses and Increasing Profits"] 
  [Text] Since 1993, all localities and departments have 
continually strengthened their leadership over the task of 
stopping losses and increasing profits for enterprises and done 
a great deal of hard and meticulous work in this respect. Thanks 
to their efforts, the task across the country has produced some 
results. 
<H5>  I. Major Steps Taken To Stop Losses, Increase Profits </H5>
  In 1993, all localities and departments continued to 
implement the State Council's "Circular on Launching an In-Depth 
Campaign To Stop Losses and Increase Profits for Enterprises" in 
accordance with the arrangements made by the State Economic and 
Trade Commission and the Ministry of Finance [ETC]. They have 
accumulated some quite successful experiences and methods in the 
following six main areas: 
  First, they implemented a system for key leaders to 
undertake 
responsibility as well as a responsibility system to meet preset 
targets for stopping losses. The former system, which held key 
leaders at all levels personally responsible for stopping losses 
and increasing profits, was an organizational arrangement to 
guarantee that this task received unremitting attention at all 
times. Under this system, leaders undertook the responsibility 
for improving the operations of big loss-suffering enterprises. 
They reached deep into the reality and conscientiously helped 
the enterprises solve the difficulties and problems encountered 
in production and operations. Meanwhile, based on the 
loss-stopping work assigned by the state, all localities and 
departments instituted a system where work targets were set up 
for fulfillment at prefectural and county levels and by the 
trades and enterprises concerned. As a result, all levels were 
required to meet certain targets. Their work was reviewed 
periodically, and an evaluation report was published every 
month. Successful units in meeting the targets were given 
awards, while those failing to do so were penalized. And each 
level was accountable to the next higher level. 
  Second, efforts were made to increase the internal reforms 
and strengthen the management of enterprises. While implementing 
the "Regulations on Transformation of Operational Mechanism of 
Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People," all 
localities and departments tried to learn from and popularize 
the Handan Steel Plant's experience, namely, to put the stress 
on tapping potentials within the enterprises as a way to stop 
losses and increase profits. More efforts were devoted to cost 
control and quota management. Separate accounting systems were 
carried out for different levels. Each unit within the 
enterprise was held responsible for the effect of its work on 
the enterprise's profits and losses. Attention was paid to 
reducing material consumption and minimizing loss and waste. In 
addition, the three systems within enterprises were reformed, 
while a risk-protection mechanism and an incentive mechanism 
were set up to improve the efficiency of management. As to those 
enterprises that had long been in the red and whose assets could 
not cover the liabilities, action was taken as the case 
required--this included closing down the enterprises, suspending 
their operations, merging them with others, switching them to 
other lines of production, and adjusting their production, 
product mix, or organizational structure. 
  Third, particular attention was given to improving big 
loss-suffering enterprises and dealing with their problems on a 
case by case basis. Based on investigations and studies, all 
localities and departments classified the loss-suffering 
enterprises into different groups according to the nature of 
their problems and decided on the priority in dealing with them. 
They worked out a list of big loss-suffering enterprises and 
made diagnostic plans after consulting with the parties 
concerned. Different measures were taken for different 
factories. Specific support was given to certain enterprises 
with a view to helping them stop losses and increase profits. In 
addition, the state and local economic and trade commissions (or 
economic commissions or planning and economic commissions in 
some localities; the same below) paid particular attention to 
the work of stopping losses and increasing profits for 300 
selected enterprises in various parts of the country. They 
conducted follow-up checks on these enterprises and monitored 
their operations on a periodical basis. 
  Fourth, a loss-stopping fund was set up to help 
loss-suffering enterprises to stop their losses. In many 
localities, the financial department or the bank set aside a 
certain amount of money to establish such a fund. Its purpose 
was to assist hopeful enterprises in developing new products and 
conducting low-cost technological upgrading. Sometimes, the 
fund was used to fill up a temporary shortage of working capital 
or to pay interest on loans. This provided a favorable condition 
for loss-suffering enterprises to stop their losses. 
  Fifth, efforts were made to increase production and boost 
revenue by relying on advance in science and technology. Some 
localities and departments, on the one hand, pooled financial 
resources to help loss-suffering enterprises to upgrade their 
equipment and manufacturing processes with a view to fully 
tapping their own potentials. On the other hand, they encouraged 
loss-suffering enterprises to benefit from advanced science and 
technology, adopt new manufacturing processes, use new 
technology and equipment, and speed up the development of new 
products and the adjustment of their product mix. This way the 
enterprises could turn out quality and marketable products to 
compete with others so as to achieve the objective of stopping 
losses. 
  Sixth, all-out efforts were made to develop the tertiary 
industry and diversified operations. 
  Apart from the above, the state adopted a series of new 
policies and measures to help eliminate losses suffered by some 
trades because of certain policies implemented in the past. This 
assisted greatly in promoting the 1993 work of stopping losses 
and increasing profits for enterprises. 
<H5>  II. Plan for Stopping Losses and Increasing Profits in 1994 </H5>
  The 1994 target for stopping losses and increasing profits 
for enterprises is to bring down the percentage of 
loss-suffering enterprises among the industrial enterprises 
contained in the state budget by 5 percentage points and to cut 
their total amount of losses by 10 percent compared with the 
1993 records. 
  To ensure the success of the 1994 work, all localities and 
departments are requested to do the following: 
  A) It is imperative to stress the responsibility for 
stopping 
enterprises' losses and continue to give them proper guidance 
according to the nature of their problems. All localities and 
departments should strengthen their leadership in organizing the 
work of stopping losses and increasing profits. They should 
continue the target responsibility system and set specific 
targets for the above-mentioned work to be met by various units 
and enterprises. They should see to it that clear-cut targets 
are assigned, and the individuals concerned are held responsible 
for the fulfillment of these targets. The management of all 
enterprises should make a list of their big loss-suffering 
units, investigate and study the problems in each case, and work 
out solutions. Different solutions should be used for different 
factories, and deadlines should be set for them to correct their 
problems. All loss-suffering enterprises are required to form a 
loss responsibility mechanism and link the interests of their 
staff members and workers to the results they achieved in 
reducing and stopping losses as a way of reward or punishment. 
In addition, the economic and trade commissions, financial and 
audit departments, and the enterprise management should conduct 
periodical supervision and inspection of the work of stopping 
losses and increasing profits. Regarding those loss-suffering 
enterprises whose performance is being followed up by the State 
Economic and Trade Commission, key leaders of local economic and 
trade commissions should be personally responsible for helping 
them solve practical problems and prompting them to stop or 
reduce losses as soon as possible. 
  B) More efforts should be devoted to operational management 
and to the tapping of potentials within enterprises. All 
localities and departments should make further efforts to learn 
from and popularize the Handan Steel Plant's experience and 
continue to gear up and improve the operational management of 
enterprises. It is important at present to beef up basic 
management, cost control, and the improvement of work shifts and 
groups. All localities and departments should institute a sound 
quota management procedure as well as other regulations, rules, 
and standards, and implement a strict performance evaluation 
system, using the management standards of domestic and foreign 
advanced enterprises as a reference. In addition, they should 
seriously implement the "General Financial Guidelines for 
Enterprises" and the "Guiding Principles for Enterprise 
Accounting," improve the economic accounting within enterprises, 
strictly enforce the budget system and financial work 
discipline, and lower all costs and expenses. 
  C) Enterprises should be dealt with on their merits. Those 
hopeful of improvement should be given support. In the first 
place, where conditions permit, local authorities and 
departments in charge of the specific trades should continue to 
put money into and make proper use of the loss-stopping fund. 
The fund should be used mainly for construction of small 
technological upgrading projects that can be applied to 
production within this year, are suited to small- and 
medium-sized enterprises, and can yield quick economic results. 
It should also be used to support loss-suffering enterprises in 
developing new products and to meet their needs for short-term 
working funds. Second, in budgeting and using various 
technological-transformation funds, the economic and trade 
commissions, as well as financial and banking departments, 
should set aside a certain amount for supporting loss-suffering 
enterprises in stopping their losses. Third, based on the 
inventory of the assets held by loss-suffering enterprises, 
plans should be worked out to solve the lingering problems left 
from the past. Fourth, after adopting the measure of granting 
loans to enterprises based on their asset-to-liability ratio, 
banks should make some interim arrangements to support those 
hopeful enterprises in improving their production and operations 
and to assist certain loss-suffering enterprises in accelerating 
their product-mix adjustment. Presently, the State Economic and 
Trade Commission is consulting with the departments concerned in 
formulating concrete measures for loss-suffering enterprises to 
obtain working-fund loans during the transitional period. 
  D) Transformation of the enterprise operational mechanism 
should be put in high gear. Continued efforts should be made to 
implement the "Regulations on Transformation of Operational 
Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People" 
and "Regulations on Supervision and Management of Industrial 
Enterprises Owned by the Whole People" to breakthrough adjusting 
the enterprise structure. Enterprises that conform to the 
state's industrial policy, are hopeful of improvement, and have 
a good market for their products, can be leased or sold to 
others, or merged with others. For those that have suffered 
losses for a long time with no hope of improvement, having more 
liabilities than assets, resolute action should be taken to 
allow them to apply for bankruptcy. In this way, we will be able 
to adjust our enterprise structure and fundamentally correct the 
mechanisms that cause losses to enterprises. 
  E) All-out efforts should be made to promote technological 
progress and further improve product quality. All localities and 
departments should energetically assist loss-suffering 
enterprises in importing advanced technology, improving 
manufacturing processes, using new materials and substitutes, 
achieving more effective utilization of energy and raw 
materials, and minimizing the material consumed for making each 
unit of product. Meanwhile, they should make positive efforts to 
organize and mobilize all staff members and workers to join the 
qualify control campaign and see to it that quality control is 
conducted at every step of the production process. For this 
purpose, strict metrological controls, acceptance tests, and 
quality-monitoring procedures should be put into effect at every 
link of production and operations. Loss-suffering enterprises 
should be encouraged to develop competitive and quality products 
so as to achieve the goal of stopping losses and increasing 
profits. 
  F) A wide-scale and in-depth campaign for "double increase 
and double economy" [campaign to increase production and 
practice economy and to increase revenues and retrench 
expenditures] should be launched. All enterprises are requested 
to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, diligence, and 
frugality. Party and government departments, trade unions, 
Communist Youth League organizations, and women's federations 
should all make concerted efforts with one mind, rely fully on 
the masses, and arouse their initiative and creativity to 
develop extensive and in-depth activities to "increase 
production and practice economy and to increase revenues and 
retrench expenditures," so as to achieve substantial results in 
stopping losses and increasing profits for enterprises. 
  This year, the deepening of enterprise reform and the 
implementation of various reform measures will bring a drastic 
change to the external environment and the operational mechanism 
of enterprises. This will have a positive effect on improving 
the operations of our state-owned enterprises. On the other 
hand, however, enterprises will be confronted with new 
questions. In particular, those enterprises with more problems 
left from the past and greater difficulties in their operations 
will find it hard to completely adapt themselves to the new 
economic system and the new changes in the market. Thus, all 
localities and departments should proceed with enterprise reform 
in a deep-going and down-to-earth way as required by the 
"Resolution" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee. They should guide enterprises to gear their 
operations to the market, beef up their management, make 
internal improvement, and quicken their pace of structural 
adjustment. In addition, they should lead enterprises to raise 
economic efficiency, improve quality in every respect, and 
strive hard to intensify the campaign for stopping losses and 
increasing profits.

Regulation Department, Anhui Provincial Economic Commission: 
"The Current Problem of Enterprise Losses and Its Solutions" -- 
Responsible Editor: Shi Yinsheng (0670 1377 3932)] 
  [Text] I. Main Features and Causes of Losses Suffered 
by Enterprises at Present 
  Losses suffered by enterprises have long been a striking 
problem hampering China's national economic development. 
Particularly in recent years, enterprises' losses have continued 
to soar, imposing a heavy financial burden on the state and 
posing difficulties for enterprises to participate in 
competition and to operate and develop independently. According 
to statistic figures released, the amount of losses seems to 
have declined in the first half of 1993. The statistics show 
that from January through June last year, 31.1 percent of the 
state-owned industrial enterprises listed in the nation's budget 
operated in the red, a drop of 0.9 percentage point from the 
same period of the previous year. The amount of losses was 13.2 
billion yuan, down by 16.5 percent compared with the losses 
registered a year ago. However, the declined figures were 
attributed mainly to a change in the petroleum industry's 
accounting procedure. In June last year, the petroleum industry 
included in the profit and loss statement a price-differential 
income of 3 billion yuan resulting from an upward adjustment of 
the price of crude oil sold during the first half of that year. 
If this extra income had not been taken into account, the total 
amount of losses suffered by the nation's industrial enterprises 
for the first half of 1993 would have been 17 percent more than 
the previous year's corresponding period. In July, the losses 
suffered by these enterprises soared sharply to 3.96 billion 
yuan. As can be seen from accounting figures, the losses for 
July was 51.5 percent more than that for June and showed a 200 
percent rise, compared with the same month of the previous year. 
The increase in the number of loss-suffering enterprises and in 
the total amount of losses reported for July was due, in part, 
to the introduction of a new financial and accounting system, 
which brought to light the hidden losses of some enterprises. 
Another reason for the increased losses was that some 
enterprises suffered more operational deficits than before. 
Overall, enterprises' losses are generally caused by the 
following factors: 
  1. Enterprises are short of working capital. Because of the 
shortage of working capital, some enterprises have no money to 
buy raw materials, and production is in a state of suspension or 
semi-suspension. Since the beginning of last year, one-third of 
the enterprises in Chongqing City in the fields of the light, 
textile, and chemical industries have totally or partially 
suspended their production, and the staff members and workers 
put on the "special leave" status have exceeded 100,000. These 
staff members and workers receive only a living allowance of 
about 50-70 yuan a month from their employers. In Jiangsu 
Province, 649 enterprises had totally or partially suspended 
their operations, and 297,000 people's jobs had been affected as 
of the end of July. 
  2. Transportation facilities are inadequate in all places. 
During the past few years, with the accelerated pace of the 
reform and opening-up drive, production and construction have 
developed by leaps and bounds, the economy has developed quickly 
in coastal areas, and imports and exports have grown steadily. 
All this has made our transportation facilities even more 
inadequate to meet the demands. During the period from January 
to July, our gross industrial output increased 25.1 percent, but 
the volume of goods transported declined 0.3 percent. At some 
critical points along the trunk railways, the freight-handling 
capacity can only meet 30-40 percent of the requirements. As 
transportation capacity falls short of the demands, large 
stockpiles of raw materials and other supplies in inland 
provinces cannot be sent out, nor is it possible to fully 
utilize the processing capacity and marketing advantage of 
coastal areas. Under such circumstances, quite a number of 
enterprises have to base their production plans on the 
transportation space available and rely on transportation 
facilities for their "survival." Unfortunately, the problem that 
out-bound cargoes cannot be loaded on the train and sent out 
promptly and in-bound cargoes cannot be unloaded in time to meet 
the needs has become more and more acute with each passing day. 
  3. State-owned enterprises have to bear heavy financial 
burdens and are faced with a relatively serious problem of 
unfair competition. First of all, they have a heavy tax and 
profit-contribution burden. In 1991, the output value of 
state-owned industrial enterprises accounted for 64 percent of 
the nation's total, while the revenue they turned over to the 
state made up 79 percent of the total revenue contributed by 
enterprises. For nonstate-owned enterprises, the percentages 
were only 36 percent and 21 percent respectively. In 1991, 
state-owned enterprises gave 94.8 percent of their revenue to 
the state in the form of taxes and profit contribution. The 
percentage of revenue turned over to the state as taxes and 
profit contribution was 76.6 percent for collective enterprises 
and 51 percent for other enterprises (including the three kinds 
of foreign-funded enterprises). Second, state-owned enterprises 
have too many superfluous personnel. In most cases, 20-30 
percent of the personnel are superfluous. But they cannot be 
dismissed because so far our society has no sound 
unemployment-welfare or social-security system to take care of 
them. Besides, there is a large number of retired workers that 
the enterprises must take care of. In most state-owned 
enterprises, the retired personnel are equivalent to 22 percent 
of the incumbent employees. In some old enterprises, the 
retirees and the incumbent employees are in a 1:1 ratio. Third, 
the enterprises have to bear the heavy burden of providing 
social welfare benefits to their employees. All the above have 
intensified the problem of unfair competition among enterprises 
of different ownership systems. This, coupled with state-owned 
enterprises' own problems regarding operational mechanisms and 
management, has curtailed their growth and slimmed down their 
share in the nation's gross value of production. In 1991, the 
output of state-owned industrial enterprises accounted for 63.8 
percent of the nation's gross value of industrial production. It 
fell to 59.2 percent in 1992 and 53.9 percent in the period 
January-July 1993. 
  4. There have appeared more factors causing the expenditure 
to increase and revenue to shrink. Beginning 1 July, the railway 
freight rate has increased by an average 1.5 fen per ton-km. The 
electricity charge also rose on 1 July by an average 2.75 fen 
for each kwh. The interest rate on bank loans has been raised 
twice by 0.8 and 1.38 percentage points, respectively. All these 
factors have increased the enterprises' expenditure and reduced 
their revenue. 
  5. A new financial and accounting system has been put into 
effect. The "General Financial Guidelines for Enterprises" and 
"Guiding Principles for Enterprise Accounting," both effective 
on 1 July, have enabled enterprises to raise their depreciation 
rate, increase their technological development expense, and set 
up a reserve for bad debts, thus boosting their capacity for 
sustained development. In doing so, however, they have also 
increased their operating costs. In addition, the new financial 
and accounting system has exposed the hidden losses and, 
therefore, reduced the profit figure on the book. This has 
aggravated the problem of losses suffered by enterprises. 
<H5>  II. Attitude To Be Taken Toward Losses Suffered by </H5>
Enterprises 
  In the market economy, profit and loss are both normal for 
enterprises. In foreign countries, some enterprises are 
constantly operating in the red. It is, therefore, not 
surprising that some enterprises in our country have suffered 
losses. To eliminate all loss-suffering enterprises in 
developing the economy is not a realistic thinking. However, if 
more than one-third of our enterprises are suffering losses, the 
situation is abnormal--it indicates that some aspects of our 
economy should be adjusted. In view of our current situation 
with respect to loss-suffering enterprises, we should at least 
do the following: 
  1. We should maintain a relatively stable macroeconomic 
environment. Facts have proved that in our country the 
proportion of loss-suffering enterprises to the total number of 
enterprises is closely related to the macroeconomic environment. 
When the macroeconomic environment is "hot," there are always a 
greater number of enterprises suffering losses. By maintaining a 
relatively stable macroeconomic environment, we can perceive the 
real situation of losses suffered by enterprises and how serious 
the problem is. This will also help ensure the relative 
stability and correct the abnormal swelling of the number of 
loss-suffering enterprises. 
  2. Among the loss-suffering enterprises in our country, a 
sizable number have suffered losses for a long time. Some are 
already in a state of less assets than liabilities. We have 
tried for a long time to "rescue" these enterprises, but without 
success. As a matter of fact, if these enterprises are 
incorrigible, we should resolutely let them go bankrupt and 
close down. Prolonging the status quo can in no way help these 
enterprises stop losses and increase profits, nor is it possible 
to make effective use of the state assets held by them. 
  3. An enterprise's deficit often involves a number of 
factors. One factor may be the incompetence of the factory 
director. Another factor may be too heavy financial obligations 
apportioned to the enterprise. Still another factor may be that 
its line of business is not right from the very beginning. So 
the work of stopping enterprises' losses and increasing their 
profits should not be just "whirling" among economic 
departments. Rather, it should be attended to by the entire 
society. 
<H5>  III. Several Measures To Stop Enterprises' Losses and </H5>
Increase Their Profits 
  1. It is imperative to rationalize the property rights of 
enterprises and transform their operational mechanism. Now, 
while transforming enterprises' operational mechanism in 
accordance with the "Regulations on Transformation of 
Operational Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the 
Whole People," some local authorities and enterprises have 
gradually extended their reform efforts to rationalizing 
property rights. State-owned enterprises can be divided into two 
groups in terms of their property rights. One group must keep to 
the state ownership. This group consists mainly of big and extra 
big enterprises in the basic sectors of the national economy. We 
should clarify the property rights and beef up the management of 
the state assets held by these enterprises. Under the 
legal-entity property system, we should grant these enterprises 
the status of legal entities and go all out to reorganize them 
into companies in an effort to form a modern enterprise system. 
The other group are enterprises that can have multiple property 
rights. They include predominantly those engaged in competitive 
production. In addition, we should rationalize the relationship 
between the central and local property rights and take various 
steps to transform state-owned enterprises into shareholding 
enterprises, such as selling a part of their original and newly 
acquired assets as shares to collectives and individuals, 
absorbing investment from other enterprises and the public, and 
developing joint ventures, legal-entity shareholders, and 
proprietary companies. 
  2. With respect to our guiding thought for economic work, we 
should shift emphasis from speed to efficiency. So far, comrades 
in some localities, departments, and enterprises have not 
changed their thinking and viewpoint. When addressing the 
question of accelerating development, they stress the need to 
boost the output value, increase the speed of growth, launch new 
projects, and expand the scope of development. They regard the 
work of stopping losses and increasing profits and the campaign 
to raise efficiency as non-concrete tasks, which require great 
efforts but yield no appreciable results. This is a 
misunderstanding. No matter how fast the economy grows, it is of 
no use if things are done without efficiency. At this time, it 
is important to speed up the self-sustaining development of the 
whole economy and make every effort to raise our economic 
efficiency. In no way should we blindly seek a high-speed growth 
of production. 
  3. Enterprises should continue to devote their efforts to 
meeting market demands. They should study the law of market, do 
well in market forecasting, and take an active part in market 
competition at home and abroad. Based on market demands and 
their own conditions, they should develop new products in good 
time and make ceaseless efforts to explore new markets in 
accordance with the law of value. Meanwhile, they should adjust 
their operational strategies from time to time in line with the 
demands on the market and changes in the environment and dare to 
find ways for their survival and development amid acute 
competition. In addition, they should gear up the marketing work 
and offer good after-sale service. 
  4. Great efforts should be made to promote technological 
progress. More work should be done to let enterprises have 
decision-making power with regard to technological 
transformation and investment. It is imperative to ensure the 
progress and completion of the projects currently under 
construction and see to it that they are put into operation and 
meet the production targets as scheduled. In particular, 
enterprises should do well in introducing advanced technology 
from abroad and energetically translate successful scientific 
and technological research results into new productive forces. 
Meanwhile, they should further improve their product quality, 
strenuously follow and make perfect the comprehensive quality 
control procedure, and institute a quality assurance system. And 
they should launch an extensive and in-depth campaign to achieve 
double increase and double the economy [a campaign to increase 
production and practice economy and to increase revenue and 
retrench expenditures].

<F P=106> [Article by Xin Hua (6580 5478): "The State Is Taking Steps </F>
To Curb the Loss of State Assets"] 
  [Text] The erosion of state assets is being paid great 
attention by the departments concerned, with the state now 
taking steps, such as perfecting laws and intensifying reform of 
our state assets management system, to solve the problem of 
state assets losses. The erosion of state assets occurs mainly 
during the establishment of "the three kinds of foreign trade" 
and shareholding-system enterprises, when scientific appraisals 
of state-enterprise assets are not or were not made, thus 
turning state assets through various channels into collective, 
individual, and foreign-firm assets, for a loss to the state. 
  A survey conducted in 1993 found that of over 10,000 state 
enterprises operating as Sino-foreign joint or contractual joint 
ventures, evaluations of the Chinese side's assets had been 
conducted in only one-third of the cases. And most enterprises 
evaluate only book assets, creating a loss of state assets of 
about 30 billion yuan a year. 
  Not evaluating or underevaluating state assets when 
organizing shareholding enterprises are also common. In 
addition, the uncompensated use of state assets to set up 
enterprises and administrative-institution units of all 
[ownership] natures, also causes erosion of state assets. 
  It is estimated that in the last decade, state-assets losses 
have amounted to about 500 billion yuan, making tax and 
state-assets losses two major severe problems for the Chinese 
economy. 
  While developing a market economy, the Chinese Government 
has 
always adhered to the dominance of the state-owned economy in 
our national economy. Even now, key products of importance to 
the national economy and the people's livelihood are still 
produced mostly by state enterprises, which still provide most 
state revenue. The economic might of state enterprises is 
growing steadily, with state assets worth 2.6846 trillion yuan 
in 1991, and growing 14.3 percent to 3.0697 trillion yuan by 
1992. 
  Analysis shows that the key reason for the loss of state 
assets is that the state has not yet established a uniform and 
effective state assets management system, with the functions of 
current state assets management departments at all levels not 
having been converted, and pertinent state assets management 
laws incomplete, leaving state assets management lacking a 
grounding in higher level and more authoritative laws. In 
addition, as property rights mechanisms have not yet been 
provided access to enterprises and, when property rights are 
sold, certain local governments practice improper administrative 
interference, artificially forcing down the proportion of 
state-asset shares in "the three kinds of foreign trade" and 
shareholding enterprises. 
  To change this severe loss of state assets, China is now 
taking a series of steps. 
  First, we are inventorying in a planned way state assets and 
funds, through which we are clarifying our resources, to verify 
and appraise state capital funds. We completed this task for 
10,000 state enterprises in 1993, and will do so for another 
10,000 in 1994. 
  We have given permission to over 1,000 accounting and 
auditing agencies throughout China to provide assets-evaluation 
services, paving the way for valid and accurate assets 
evaluations of all concerned parties when state enterprises sell 
[transfer] property rights. 
  Meanwhile, enterprise assets-evaluation certificates 
certified by the state assets management sector have become 
essential examination and approval documents for upgrading 
enterprises to Sino-foreign joint ventures and shareholding. 
  It is understood that the NPC Standing Committee is now 
drafting a "State Assets Law," which will be included in its 
immediate legislative plans, and is speeding up the formulation 
of "Terms for the Oversight and Management of State Enterprise 
Assets," and evaluation targets and methods for state assets 
value-preservation and appreciation. 
  State Administration of State Property officials say that 
for 
all future state-enterprise property-rights alterations, we will 
conduct inventories of assets and funds, delimiting property 
rights, settling bonded debts, and registering property rights, 
to establish a rigorous examination and approval system.

Bureau under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: 
"Consolidated Report on Symposium Discussing Theory and Practice 
of Modern Enterprise System"--Responsible Editor: Xiao Da (2556 
6671)] 
  [Text] To carry out the guidelines contained in the 
decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, transform China's state-owned enterprises into 
companies, and establish a socialist modern enterprise system in 
our country, the Institute of Industrial Economics under the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences sponsored a "Symposium on 
Theory and Practice of Modern Enterprise System" in Beijing from 
30 November to 3 December 1993. Attending the symposium were 
factory directors and managers from nearly 40 medium-sized, 
large-, and extra large enterprises around the country and 
economics scholars in the capital. 
  Proceeding from reality, the entrepreneurs summed up the 
experiences and lessons obtained in recent years in conducting 
enterprise reform and exchanged their views on how to build a 
modern enterprise system in our country. The economists 
expounded the essence and the prime importance of building such 
a system from both the theoretical and practical viewpoints. 
They also discussed such questions as theoretical and practical 
difficulties in building China's modern enterprise system as 
well as ways, methods, and strategies to be adopted to transform 
existing enterprises. One salient feature of this symposium was 
that economists and entrepreneurs got together to discuss an 
important issue on economic reform. Highlights of the symposium 
follow: 
<H5>  I. Contents and Essence of Modern Enterprise System </H5>
  The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
decided unequivocally that the reform of our state-owned 
enterprises should be oriented toward the modern enterprise 
system. What is the modern enterprise system? What are covered 
by this system? But what is its essence? These were priority 
and principal questions studied and discussed by the 
participants in the symposium. As can be seen from their 
discussions, the modern enterprise system is very comprehensive 
in nature, and divergent views existed on the tasks of building 
such a system in our country. 
  1. The modern enterprise system has come into being to suit 
the needs of meeting the needs of the market economy. It basic 
components are: a) a legal-entity system whereby enterprises 
themselves are responsible for their profits and losses; b) an 
enterprise leadership system characterized by vertical 
delegation of power; c) a standardized financial and accounting 
system; d) an enterprise income distribution system which 
benefits all concerned, and e) an enterprise personnel and 
labor system whereby employment is based on two-way choice 
between the employer and employee. To build such a modern 
enterprise system, China must conduct thoroughgoing reforms in 
the above-mentioned five areas. 
  2. Tasks for building a modern enterprise system in China 
should include: a) Institution of a scientific property rights 
system. This requires the entrepreneurial management of the 
departments that deal with enterprise property rights. These 
departments should be able to reflect and adjust the property 
rights structure based on the given ownership. b) 
Rationalization of the enterprise organization. China's 
enterprise reform has developed from the implementation of the 
policy of granting power to enterprises to the stage of 
instituting a new enterprise system. Companies are the most 
typical, advanced and effective form of enterprise organization 
under the condition of the market economy. c) Improvement of 
enterprises' internal systems, aimed at switching their function 
from pure production management to all-round operational 
management. d) Transformation of enterprises' internal 
management systems, including the legal system, leadership 
system, unemployment insurance system, income distribution 
system, cadre and personnel system, and labor employment system. 
  3. The following objectives should be achieved in building 
the modern enterprise system: Enterprises should be relieved 
from the status of affiliation with government departments so as 
to truly separate enterprise management from government 
administration. They should become legal entities responsible 
for their own profits and losses and acting as the mainstay on 
the market. Their organizational and managerial systems should 
be scientific and standardized. And there should be a real 
change in the government functions in relation to enterprises. 
To this end, the modern enterprise system should contain the 
following: a) a criterion for regulating the relationship 
between the government's administrative department and 
enterprises; b) a criterion for regulating the relationship 
between enterprises and the departments controlling and managing 
state assets; c) a criterion for regulating the relationship 
among owners, managers, and employees; and d) a criterion for 
regulating the relationship between investors' ownership and the 
property rights of legal entities. 
  4. The core of the modern enterprise system is the 
legal-entity system, that is, the system widely practiced in the 
world that treats companies as legal entities. It consists of 
many elements, including the systems for property rights, 
accounting, organization (types of enterprises), and management 
(organizations and departments). In essence, it has the 
following characteristics: On the one hand, the state holds the 
ultimate ownership of the property of state-owned enterprises, 
thus ensuring their public ownership. On the other hand, the 
enterprises, based on the property rights of the legal entities, 
are truly independent commodity producers and managers 
responsible for their own profits and losses, and they function 
as the mainstay on the market. The system of companies as legal 
entities serves as a link between public ownership and the 
market economy. 
  5. The key to instituting the modern enterprise system is to 
recognize the legal entities' property rights and the investors' 
rights of investment. The characteristics of the system in this 
respect are: clearly defined property rights, explicitly 
specified authority and responsibility, separation of government 
administration from enterprise management, scientific management 
methods, and suitability to the needs of the market economy. 
  6. The modern enterprise system has been created to meet the 
needs of the market economy. Therefore, it has the following 
characteristics: a) All enterprise activities are centered 
around the market. Enterprises base their production on supply 
and demand in the market and are the mainstay in market 
activities. b) Enterprises really operate on their own; they are 
no longer belongings of the government. c) All enterprise 
activities are based on profit-making. Enterprises themselves 
are responsible for their profits and losses and exercise 
self-restraint. d) Through the market mechanism, enterprises 
compete with each other on an equal basis and achieve 
self-improvement. Successful enterprises prosper, while those 
which fail in the competition are eliminated. 
<H5>  II. Questions To Be Resolved and Measures To Be Taken in </H5>
Transforming State-Owned Enterprises Into Companies and Building 
the Modern Enterprise System 
  1. Question of understanding. Although the decision of the 
14th CPC National Congress unequivocally points out that 
building a modern enterprise system represents the direction 
that all enterprises should keep to, and most people understand 
in varying degrees the need for transforming state-owned 
enterprises into companies, some still take a negative or 
skeptical attitude toward this question. They equate the 
implementation of the shareholding system and the reform of the 
enterprise system and the property rights system to a change of 
the ownership system. According to these people, implementing 
the shareholding system and reforming the property rights system 
are acts of privatization. This is incorrect. It should be noted 
that the ownership system embodies the essence of the relations 
of production. It deals with property relations in the 
perspective of property ownership. The shareholding system, on 
the other hand, deals with property relations from the 
producers' standpoint. The new enterprise system is aimed at 
creating an effective form of the state-owned sector of the 
economy. The focal point is to change the ineffective state 
asset management under the old system and design an enterprise 
system compatible with the market economy. There is no such 
question as using the new enterprise system to change the 
socialist ownership system. 
  2. Rationalization of property rights relations and 
establishment of a new property rights system for state-owned 
enterprises. The state may, through entrusted management, enable 
enterprises to hold legal-entity property rights to state 
assets. This clarifies the state-enterprise relationship with 
respect to property rights. At the same time, the state should 
undertake limited responsibilities on the state assets used by 
enterprises. 
  3. Definition of property rights. While transforming 
enterprises into companies, how to scientifically classify and 
define property rights is a central question in building the 
modern enterprise system. In principle, the ownership of state 
assets belongs to the state, while enterprises possess all the 
legal-entity property rights resulting from the investments made 
by investors, including the state. However, the concept of 
ownership by the state is too generic and is apt to create a 
situation of no specific representative of the owner. For this 
reason, some participants in the symposium made the following 
suggestion: State property rights should be divided into 
different levels; that is, the owners should be diversified and 
the property rights held by different levels of government. 
According to our present government financial system, four 
levels of government can hold property rights, i.e., the 
central, provincial, prefectural, and county levels. Defining 
the property rights according to the principle that whoever made 
the investment has the property rights and receives the returns 
will help solve the problem of no definite state asset owner. As 
to more specific and complicated questions, such as how to 
define the property rights to new fixed assets resulting from 
technological-upgrading investment using enterprises' own funds 
or loans, some clear-cut provisions should be worked out. In 
this regard, some participants suggested that a concrete 
analysis be made of the technological-upgrading funds. If the 
principal and interest on the loan have been repaid, they said, 
the related assets may be treated as shares held by the legal 
entity. If the enterprise cannot pay back the loan, the related 
assets should become investment by the state or the bank 
concerned. 
  4. Appraisal of assets. In transforming state-owned 
enterprises into companies, a key task is the appraisal of their 
assets. State assets should be appraised by independent 
intermediary service organizations. In doing this, it is 
imperative to minimize administrative intervention, seek truth 
from facts, keep to the "Provisions Governing State Asset 
Appraisal," and take into account both tangible and intangible 
assets. Appraisal of tangible assets should be based on their 
replacement value. The original inventory should be treated as 
shares held by the state, while additional assets should be 
turned into shares held by the legal entities. Land may be 
appraised in accordance with the State Land Management 
Regulations and the current land market price. Intangible assets 
should be transferred according to law with attention to 
protecting the creditors' due interests. As for patents and 
proprietary technologies, consideration should be given to such 
factors as the scope of application and approved duration of 
technical secrecy so that the appraisal will fully reflect their 
effective value. 
  5. Management of state assets. In addition to defining 
property rights and appraising assets, how to manage state 
assets is also a very important question in transforming 
state-owned enterprises into the shareholding system. A 
suggested solution is to establish a sound three-tier 
organizational structure for the control and management of state 
assets: a) Establishment of a state asset administrative 
department to ensure the effective utilization and appreciation 
of state assets. b) Establishment of intermediary organizations 
for managing state assets, such as investment companies, holding 
companies, and enterprise groups. This way enterprises engaged 
in production and other operations will not be linked directly 
to the government's administrative departments, thus ensuring 
the separation of enterprise management from government 
administration. c) Management of state assets in the same way as 
financial management with attention to preserving their value 
and ensuring their mobility. 
  6. Need to choose the right forms of stockholding in 
transforming state-owned enterprises. In line with China's 
actual conditions, the following forms may be adopted according 
to the types of investments: a) Companies wholly owned by the 
state. In general, this form is suitable for enterprises making 
special-category products or producing armaments. b) Stock 
companies with control shares held by the state. In most cases, 
this is suitable for backbone enterprises in the fields of 
pillar and basic industries. c) Stock companies with shares held 
by both the state and the enterprises as legal entities. 
Generally speaking, this is suitable for enterprise groups and 
enterprises with diversified investments. d) Stock companies 
with shares held by their employees. e) Stock companies which 
are Sino-foreign joint ventures. 
  7. Appropriate solution to problems left by enterprises. a) 
Debts. Although state-owned enterprises have undergone reform, 
in general their economic returns remain at a low level, and 
most of them are debt-ridden because the fundamental question of 
property rights has not been well resolved. According to 
estimates by the department concerned, industrial enterprises 
contained in the state budget are laden with working-fund loans 
and special-purpose loans, totaling 800 billion yuan. If all 
their profits were used to repay these loans, it would take 18 
years to clear up the debts, calculated at the 1990 interest 
rate. The interest alone amounts to tens of billions of yuan a 
year. In view of this, some participants suggested that, in the 
transformation of the enterprises into companies, debts between 
legal entities be treated as shares given by the debtors to the 
creditors. b) Social welfare burdens. First, most state-owned 
enterprises have the problems of being overstaffed and a growing 
number of retired personnel of whom to take care. Statistics 
show that about 20 percent of their personnel are superfluous, 
and another 20 percent are retirees. In addition to establishing 
as soon as possible a social insurance system and an old-age 
insurance system to solve these problems, some participants 
suggested that, when appraising the enterprises' total assets, a 
proper amount of money be set aside as a settlement assistance 
fee to guarantee the livelihood of the laid-off and retired 
employees. At the same time, the laid-off and retired employees 
are encouraged to engage in the tertiary trade to support 
themselves. Second, enterprises are now providing social 
welfare benefits to their employees. This entails great 
difficulties, numerous problems, and remarkable contradictions. 
The work involved is extremely comprehensive and complicated. To 
provide such benefits to the employees not only brings numerous 
problems to enterprise management, but also creates 
contradictions between the enterprises and the government. It 
was suggested that, after the enterprises have been reorganized, 
their non-business facilities, such as dependent schools, 
clinics, mess halls, and housing agents, be operated by the new 
companies under a special program, and that a fee be charged for 
the use of these facilities. This will not hurt the 
shareholders' interests and, at the same time, satisfy the needs 
of the employees. Third, enterprises are burdened with 
unreasonably exacted fees. It is expected that this problem will 
be radically removed after the enterprises have been transformed 
into companies, their legal-entity status has been gradually 
clarified, and the reforms in the government's functional and 
other departments have developed in depth. At this time, it is 
imperative to strictly enforce the state regulations on banning 
unwarranted exaction of fees so as to lessen the enterprises' 
burden and facilitate their transformation into companies. 
  8. Establishment of a new management system within 
enterprises. After transformation into companies, state-owned 
enterprises should deepen the reform of their labor, personnel, 
income distribution, management, and leadership systems, 
optimize their structure, and quicken the change of their 
operational mechanism so that they will have a higher labor 
productivity, better product quality, and lower production 
costs, all of which are prerequisite to success in market 
competition. First, with regard to the reform of the labor 
employment system, there are two major tasks: Enterprises should 
gain the power--namely, the power to hire employees. The 
government should build the market--that is, cultivate and 
transform the labor market. In this regard, some participants 
suggested a labor employment system based on two-way free choice 
between enterprises and employees and a combination of regular, 
contract, and temporary workers. In most cases, the contract 
worker system should be used, while, in a few special cases, the 
temporary worker system may be adopted. The above-mentioned 
three kinds of workers have different pay scales, but their 
status is not unchangeable. In addition, efforts should be made 
to improve the employees' performance evaluation system and the 
social security system. Second, it is necessary to modernize our 
enterprise management -- from the management mentality to the 
ways and means of management -- and to build a high-efficiency 
and quickly reactive enterprise organizational structure. In 
reforming enterprise management organization, the difficulty 
lies in how to separate supplementary units from main units, how 
to settle the surplus employees, and how to avoid double 
taxation after the separation of supplementary units and the 
formation of new enterprises. Third, a modern enterprise 
financial and accounting system should be established in 
compliance with the requirements set forth in the "General 
Financial Guidelines for Enterprises" and the "Guiding 
Principles for Enterprise Accounting." Fourth, it is necessary 
to standardize the activities of enterprises and accelerate the 
transformation of their internal operational mechanism. Fifth, 
the leadership system in enterprises should be reformed. Under 
the modern enterprise system, enterprises should have the power 
to manage their financial affairs, make operational decisions, 
and direct and supervise their production and other operations. 
Because of this, there should be a multilayered leadership 
system based on vertical delegation of power, consisting of the 
shareholders' meeting, board of directors, board of supervisors, 
and managerial group. These organizations should exercise power 
of major policy making, power of supervision, and power for the 
formulation and implementation of policies on day-to-day 
business. Meanwhile, the modern enterprise leadership system 
should adhere to the principle that the party plays a core role 
in the ideological and political work within enterprises. Also, 
it should carry forward the role of the workers' congress in 
democratic management of enterprises. Party committees, trade 
unions, and staff and worker representatives should get involved 
in the work of the boards of supervisors and directors so as to 
enlarge the scope and enhance the substance of democratic 
management of enterprises. 
  9. Acceleration of all supplementary reforms and improvement 
of enterprises' external environment. a) We should change the 
government's economic management function and, instead, set up a 
macro-regulatory and control system relying mainly on indirect 
means: To this end, we should, first of all, deepen the price 
reform and form a pattern whereby the price is determined by 
supply and demand. Second, we should have a unified tax system 
so that enterprises can compete on the market on equal terms. 
Third, we should make all-out efforts to cultivate the market 
and form an integrated, open, and orderly market system so as to 
provide enterprises with a sound market environment. b) We 
should set up and develop various kinds of intermediary 
organizations and institute a system which requires these 
organizations to undertake certain responsibilities. c) We 
should create an environment for implementing the legal system 
so that there are laws for enterprises to follow in conducting 
their economic activities. This work includes the perfection of 
the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law. Meanwhile, we should form a 
property rights market and optimize the allocation of resources 
in society. c) We should build a multilayered social security 
system and improve the old-age and unemployment insurance 
systems. The social security system should start as a 
rudimentary welfare program, and its scope should be gradually 
expanded to include medical, housing, and education benefits. As 
to the financial sources for the insurance systems, the state, 
enterprises, and employees are required to share the burden in a 
reasonable way. 
<H5>  III. Ways and Means for Transforming State-Owned Enterprises </H5>
Into Companies 
  1. Different views exist on the possibility of turning 
state-owned enterprises into companies: a) The transformation of 
state-owned enterprises into companies is due to the following 
reason: The organizational form and operational mechanism of 
wholly-state-owned enterprises cannot meet the needs of 
development of the market economy, and a general expansion of 
enterprise power is not a radical solution to the longstanding 
problems. Transformation of enterprises into companies will 
enable them to build sound mechanisms for promoting production 
and sales and for motivating, developing, and restraining 
themselves. Such transformation will also be an effective way to 
form a correct relationship between the state and enterprises. 
Now, in our country, the development of the multiple-ownership 
system, diversification of principal investors and 
beneficiaries, and expansion of lateral cooperation among 
enterprises have provided favorable conditions for developing 
stockholding enterprises. For this reason, we should turn 
state-owned enterprises into companies and speed up their 
transformation toward the shareholding system. ) It is rather 
difficult to transform large and medium-sized state-own 
enterprises into the stockholding system. Without proper 
solutions to the questions concerning asset appraisal, property 
rights, and employees' social welfare benefits, the shareholding 
system is only an exploratory, trial system, and most 
state-owned enterprises cannot be changed into companies. 
However, we may "copy the system to change our mechanism." That 
is, we may copy the company's system, including its legal-entity 
status and internal management organization, to achieve the 
objective of transforming our enterprises' operational 
mechanism. To do this, we should continue to base the work on 
the "Law Concerning Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole 
People" and "Regulations on Transformation of Operational 
Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People." 
We should give state-owned enterprises decision-making power 
with regard to management, grant them the status as legal 
entities, and establish as soon as possible an enterprise 
organizational system modeled on the management structure of 
companies. 
  2. Scope of transformation to companies (shareholding 
system): (1) Shareholding is a good system for developing the 
market economy and optimizing the ownership structure. Stock 
companies can sever the link between the government and 
enterprises and achieve the goal of separating ownership from 
the power of management. They are the most suitable form of 
enterprise organization for the development of the market 
economy. Therefore, all-out efforts should be made to popularize 
stock companies and make them the principal type of enterprises 
in China. Nonetheless, not all enterprises can be switched to 
the shareholding system. For this reason, state-owned 
enterprises should be transformed into the following different 
organizational forms: Enterprises of unitary ownership by the 
public with their capital owned by the central government or a 
local government at a certain level. Enterprises of multiple 
ownership by the public (which have been transformed into stock 
companies) with their capital owned jointly by the central and 
local governments or by different local governments. Enterprises 
with the government holding control shares--in these enterprises 
the government shares play a leading role. And enterprises with 
the government holding regular shares--in these enterprises the 
government acts merely as a regular shareholder, not as a 
controlling shareholder. (2) Relatively speaking, the 
shareholding system is suited to those large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises which have to face competition in doing 
their business and which should reorganize their production 
elements. Therefore, we should define a proper scope for the 
implementation of the shareholding system. 
  3. How to transform enterprises into companies. Most 
participants said that the majority of China's enterprises 
should be transformed into limited-liability companies. Specific 
comments were as follows: a) Transformation of state-owned 
enterprises into companies is to change the "factory-type" 
enterprises owned solely by the state and managed directly by 
the government into "company-type" enterprises with multiple 
investors and managed by the enterprises themselves. For most 
enterprises, the type of company to be adopted is the 
limited-liability company. This type of company has many 
advantages: Its capital can be pooled quickly, and its operation 
is relatively simple. The transformation is easy and not costly. 
Its activities can be easily standardized. A small number of 
enterprises with heavy renovation or expansion tasks or 
requiring large amounts of funds for production and construction 
may be turned into limited-liability stock companies. In 
general, however, state-owned enterprises should not be 
transformed into wholly-state-owned limited-liability companies 
so as to avert the appearance of flipped-plate companies [fan 
pai gong si 5064 3654 0361 0674; referring to government 
institutions that have been turned into companies but illegally 
use previous government connections for profiteering], which 
will be a new obstacle to the in-depth development of the 
reform. Methods to avoid this are letting legal entities buy 
each other's shares, converting debts into shares, soliciting 
foreign investors, and absorbing capital from society as 
investment. b) The purpose of transforming our state-owned 
enterprises into companies is to correct a drawback of these 
enterprises, namely, the unitariness and abstractness of their 
property rights, and to separate government administration from 
enterprise management through the diversification of property 
rights and the clarification of relations of property rights. 
Therefore, in the transformation of enterprises into companies, 
only a few of them should be turned into companies of sole 
proprietorship, while most should become limited-liability 
companies or limited-liability stock companies with diverse 
investors. The choice depends on the enterprises' internal and 
external conditions. In foreign countries, big enterprises are 
generally limited-liability stock companies, while most small 
and medium-sized enterprises are limited-liability companies. In 
China, we should try to limit the number of companies of sole 
proprietorship when transforming our state-owned enterprises 
into companies. To do this, we should let legal entities become 
shareholders and encourage them to buy each other's shares. c) 
Judging from China's actual conditions, it will be impossible to 
turn all state-owned enterprises into listed stock companies. 
Most enterprises should be transformed into either 
limited-liability companies (including Sino-foreign joint 
ventures) or wholly-state-owned companies. d) One of the 
significant reasons for proposing a modern enterprise system is 
to treat wholly-state-owned companies as a company category and, 
in a certain sense, distinguish them from stock companies. Under 
the present circumstances, however, wholly-state-owned companies 
are viewed as a kind of limited-liability company rather than a 
separate category. Compared with state-owned enterprises, 
whole-state-owned limited-liability companies represent a leap 
from unlimited-liability enterprises which are not legal 
entities to limited-liability enterprises which act as legal 
entities. The transformation of big and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises into limited-liability companies may be carried out 
as an intermediate step. In the future, however, most of them 
should be turned into stock companies or openly listed stock 
companies. 
  4. The question of legal entities as shareholders and legal 
entities holding each other's shares. Following views were 
expressed at the symposium: a) In transforming state-owned 
enterprises into companies, we should let legal entities hold 
shares and especially hold each other's shares. Participants 
holding this view deemed it necessary to stress the need for 
companies as legal entities to possess shares in order to 
diversify the share ownership. According to them, state-owned 
enterprises should possess each other's shares so as to nullify 
the ultimate-ownership mechanism and give prominence to the 
rights and interests of those who actually manage the 
enterprises. Over time, the pertinent government departments' 
authority over the enterprises will gradually become nominal, 
and the enterprises will be able to operate on their own. b) 
Reasons for promoting legal-entity shareholders in the 
transformation of enterprises into companies: One is to change 
the original meanings of the ownership systems. Since 
legal-entity shareholders represent thousands upon thousands of 
individuals, shares held by legal entities mean shares held by 
the masses. As a result, the original "pure private ownership" 
will become something close to a "social ownership." Capitalist 
ownership will no longer be a pure private ownership system. A 
similar diluting effect will be exerted on the socialist 
ownership system as well. The second reason is to greatly weaken 
the shareholders' rights and boost the managers' rights. The 
third reason is that with legal-entity shareholders, management 
will not be easily dictated by individual shareholders' 
shortsighted activities aimed at seeking dividends. c) Some 
entrepreneurs expressed a different view about letting legal 
entities become shareholders and hold each other's shares. 
Letting them hold each other's shares, they said, may be a very 
effective way for enterprise transformation in the future. But 
under the current circumstances where most enterprises are 
suffering losses in varying degrees and experiencing capital 
shortage and financial difficulty, how can they buy each other's 
shares? This is impractical at least at this time, they added. 
  5. In discussions, some theoreticians and entrepreneurs 
noted 
that, in the transformation of enterprises into companies, a 
not-to-be-slighted question is that the reform of Chinese 
enterprises' property rights must be accompanies by the 
establishment of an entrepreneur system. History has proven that 
managerial professionals constitute an inevitable social stratum 
whether in feudal or capitalist society. This stratum makes 
perfect the model of separation of management and ownership. The 
birth and formation of the entrepreneur system is not merely of 
importance to management science. Rather, its importance to 
economics outweighs its importance to management science. The 
entrepreneur system constitutes an integral part of the modern 
capitalist property rights system. When a consensus has been 
reached on reorganizing the property rights related to our 
state-owned enterprises, the next question to be understood by 
all is that our institution of the enterprise legal-entity 
system must be closely integrated with the formation of an 
entrepreneur system.

Is Needed To Control the Wide Horse of Inflation"] 
  [Text] Sufferings of a Benchworker in a Wave of 
"Price Increases" 
  The 200 million urban residents in China have begun to 
receive the tremendous pressure since the beginning of 1994. 
Right after absorbing the two-digit inflation in 1993, they have 
witnessed the tide of rural workers who have flooded the cities. 
When the raging tide of rural workers slightly subsided, they 
are once again awakened by the loud clamors of "price increases." 
  Under the influence of increasing demand and high production 
costs, the market price had sharply increased in January. The 
prices for consumer goods in January rose 23.1 percent as 
compared with that of the same period in 1993. The rate of 
increases for food, clothing, health care, entertainment, 
education and culture was even relatively higher. 
  Due to the after-effect of the excessive amount of currency 
in circulation, the price of basic industrial products continued 
to rise on a large scale in February, and signs showing price 
increases were everywhere on the market. The rate of price 
increases for the first two months in 1994 still exceeded 20 
percent over the corresponding period in 1993. 
  Since the People's Bank of China had once again handled 
value-guaranteed saving deposits on 11 July 1993, it had, for 
the first time, announced that the annual subsidy rate for 
value-guaranteed saving deposits was set to 1.19 percent in 
March 1994. The All China Federation of Trade Unions also made 
public that about 7 million workers are badly off in the whole 
country. 
  On the eve of the "two sessions," Fang Shunping, a 
benchworker in Yongsheng Machinery Plant in Fuzhou, Jiangxi 
narrated a pathetic story to a grassroots-level trade union 
cadre about how he suffered from the skyrocketing commodity 
price. 
  He said: "Our plant suffered financial losses since last 
year. I and my wife persistently worked hard everyday. Our 
combined wages total slightly over 300 yuan. 
  "Our chubby boy is a fourth-grade student. He does not care 
much about food or clothes. The only thing he likes most is to 
play the game machine. However, I cannot afford to buy a game 
machine. 
  "In order to play the game machine, my son let those 
students with game machines to ride him as a horse everyday. 
Once I discovered that. I pulled my perspiring son to the side, 
and asked him why he did something stupid like this? He said 
nothing, but struggled to get free and ran away. Only when he 
came home, did he tell me the reason in tears. 
  "In the evening, my son who finished his homework told me 
quietly: `Dad, buy me a game machine please. If I have a game 
machine, I will not let other students ride me as a horse.' 
  "I felt really bad. Hugging him tightly, I said: `It is not 
that I am unwilling to buy you a game machine. It is just 
because that commodity price is so high that I cannot afford to 
buy the game machine. I can barely buy food with what I earn. I 
really cannot help you.' 
  "My son seemed to understand my plight. With grievous 
disappointment, he went to bed. That night, I could not sleep. 
The price is going up and up like a balloon filled with hydrogen 
gas. Why is that?" 
  The question posed by Fang Shunping is also in the minds of 
the 7 million workers who are badly off. Whoever listens to his 
grievances is not only the basic-level trade union cadre. These 
workers often hear that they must pay a price for carrying out 
reform. They only want to know how high the price they need to 
pay this year. They also understand that they need to withstand 
hardship in order to successfully carry out reform. They only 
want to know for what they need to suffer so much. 
<H5>  Probe Sources of High Price Index </H5>
  The civilian sector and the government have their own 
forecasts for this year's general level of retail sales. Not 
long ago, the "Department of Macro-Economic Analysis of China" 
conducted the 6th survey on China's economic situation by 
distributing questionnaires to the specialists concerned. One 
hundred fifty-eight economists expressed their own views on 
this. According to statistics, 32.9 of them predicted that the 
rate of increase of retail sales will be in the range of 12-14 
percent; 29.1 percent of them predicted 8-10 percent; and 22.8 
percent of them predicted 12-14 percent. Some young scholars 
conducted simulated tests on the economic situation in 1992 and 
1993. Their conclusion was that if the rate of economic growth 
in 1994 is maintained at approximately 10 percent, then the rate 
of increase of retail price index will be in the range of 12-13 
percent. Their judgment has been proven correct by the red light 
shown by the price indices of the three months in this year's 
first quarter. Therefore, high commodity price will remain the 
major rhythm in 1994. There are five reasons for this. 
  1. After-Effects of Price Reform. Since the price reform, 
more than 80 percent of the price for means of production and 90 
percent of the price for means of subsistence have been 
completely decontrolled. The seriously distorted price structure 
has been gradually corrected by the large price increases for 
the basic industrial products. For example, after its decontrol, 
the price of grain and fuel rose by 35.5 percent and 78 percent, 
respectively. These large price increases for basic capital 
goods and consumer goods have pushed up the production costs of 
farm products and industrial manufactured goods, and made the 
prices for products manufactured by related industries to go up. 
As seen from the situation in 1994, the series of price 
adjustments recently announced will become a major reason for 
pushing up China's general price index for this year. 
  2. Excessive Issuance of Currency. Prior to this round of 
inflation, the amount of currency issued in 1992 was increased 
by 115.9 billion yuan as compared with that in 1991. Because of 
the multiplicative effect, the issuance of 115.9 billion yuan 
basic currency is equivalent to derivative loans of 200 to 250 
billion yuan. The additional currency issued in 1992 not only 
helped awaken the enthusiasm in production and consumption, 
which was dampened by the campaign for improvement and 
rectification of the economic order, but also pushed the 1993 
commodity price to a high rate of 13 percent. Thus, the 1993 
policy of putting more money into circulation in support of high 
economic growth (50 percent higher than that in 1992) will 
definitely impose a burden on the economy in 1994. Excessive 
currency issuance accounted for 5.5 percent of the total blame 
for the inflation in 1993. It is estimated that this figure may 
exceed 7 percent this year. 
  3. Rising Cost of Social Labor. In order to arouse the 
enthusiasm of workers, enterprises that are making good profits 
often increase workers' wages and bonuses. The total amount of 
wages for workers in 1993 grew approximately 20 percent over 
1992. Those local governments with more money also increase 
subsidies to their administrative personnel. The plan to 
readjust salaries of government employees announced in October 
last year had given pay raises to all members of the civil 
service. Due to the rigid nature of the wage system, it has 
objectively raised the cost of social labor and become a major 
factor in pushing the price up. 
  4. Restraints by "Bottleneck" Effect and Resources. These 
two 
types of restraints have always been hampering economic 
development. If the rate of economic growth is maintained at 
approximately 10 percent, the effect of the two types of 
restraints will be felt even more distinctively. It will make 
the price of relevant products to sharply increase. 
  5. Rapid Investment Growth. Over a protracted period of 
time, 
the rapid growth in demand for investment is the major factor in 
China's economic growth. However, the year of high investment 
often means a year of high prices. The main reason is that price 
increases are caused by increasing investment and by the 
imbalance between supply and demand due to irrational investment 
structure or poor investment performance. 
<H5>  Government Is Determined To Tame "Wild Horse of Inflation" </H5>
  Due to lack of information and other reasons, the general 
public in China often fails to foresee an inflationary trend. 
However, the high commodity price for two years running has 
exerted great pressure on the residents psychologically. For the 
first two months in 1994, the retail price for consumer goods on 
the domestic market was up 25.9 percent over that in 1993. 
People are on the verge of panic buying. The issue of commodity 
price becomes the focus of deputies' conversation at the "two 
sessions" and arouses the close attention of the government 
leaders. At the group meeting with the Beijing deputy group of 
the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress held 
on 12 March, Premier Li Peng said that it is necessary to 
exercise the macro-control in the course of decontrolling price. 
At the group meeting with the Hunan deputy group on the same 
day, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji emphatically pointed out that in 
order to keep down prices, the CPC Central Committee and State 
Council decided to adopt the following four measures: 1) Efforts 
should be made to control the size of investment in fixed assets 
and that of consumer spending. 2) The governments at all levels 
must pay full attention to agriculture and the "shopping basket" 
project. 3) The government must strengthen the macro-control 
over market price. 4) In the very near future, a series of 
economic measures will be taken to keep down prices. Prior to 
and after the two sessions, the State Council in late March 
decided to conduct a major checkup of commodity price. This 
checkup is expected to last three months. It also instructed the 
State Planning Commission to work in coordination with the 
supervisory, financial, taxation, auditing, and technical 
control departments as well as the industrial and commercial 
administration to form work teams to go to various provinces, 
autonomous regions and municipalities under the direct 
administration of the government to help carry out the work of 
price checkup. Some local governments have also worked out rules 
and regulations to prevent people from making sudden huge 
profits in order to keep down prices. All these measures were 
highly praised by economists and ordinary residents. They 
appreciate the efforts made by the government in quickly 
tackling the issue of inflation which is menacing the rapidly 
developing economy. At the same time, an official of the 
Ministry of Labor stressed that the state has officially 
promulgated the "Regulations on Minimum Wage in Enterprises" 
aimed at ensuring that each worker will earn at least the 
minimum wage with which he can meet the basic needs in 
livelihood for himself and his family members. The official also 
asked various localities to make wage adjustments from time to 
time according to the living expense index. 
<H5>  Taking Part in Investment, You May Run Faster Than a Wide </H5>
Horse 
  Whether you are willing to do so or not, you will feel an 
impulse to make investment and like to increase your credit, as 
long as China maintains a high rate of economic growth. This 
kind of economic growth on the basis of credit will make you 
live with inflation. 
  For most of the wage earners, no one is living like Fang 
Shunping any more. Right now, the total amount of savings 
deposits in rural and urban areas has reached 1.65 trillion 
yuan. If we count the cash in residents' hands, the social 
capital in China has reached 2 trillion yuan. Economists pointed 
out that we must make all kinds of investments in order to 
preserve and increase the value of the money while living in an 
inflationary environment. 
  During the 1980's, people in China only have two totally 
different markets. One is the market of consumer goods for basic 
subsistence, while the other is one for expensive high-quality 
merchandise. In recent years, stocks, bonds, fund-raising 
associations, real estate agencies and rural foundations of a 
shareholding and cooperative nature have emerged. In face of all 
types of investment programs with higher investment returns, 
more and more urban residents want to make money not only for 
filling their shopping baskets, but they also for buying houses, 
investing in stock and taking part in other investment programs. 
Signs have indicated that more and more people are investing 
money in China's capital market. The main participants of the 
capital market will be the 200 million urban population and the 
30 percent of the rural population -- peasants who are capable 
of extending reproduction. The growth of this major group of 
investors means that the state-run economic sector may gradually 
let the nongovernment economic sector to share the market. 
Meanwhile, it is precisely because of the nongovernment 
financing market which has attracted a huge amount of currency 
on the market that the "wide horse of inflation" was reined in 
to a certain extent and a runaway inflation of more than 30 
percent as predicted by some economists did not appear. 
  At a time when individual investments aimed at withstanding 
inflation and achieving social diversity have gradually become 
the common choice of hundreds of millions of people, various 
strategies and tactics for investment are being offered to all 
those who are interested in making investments. If you want to 
invest in stock, you must understand the company which floats 
the stock, and read reports on its financial situation. If you 
buy and sell bonds, you must know how to calculate the earning 
rate. If you handle transactions in futures, you must pay 
attention to the price of rice and cotton at home and abroad and 
even the situation concerning ocean freight as well as the 
weather conditions and political situation in various countries. 
If you buy and sell foreign exchange, you must be able to 
predict the changes of economic policies of the major countries, 
and understand the rules and regulations governing the 
international foreign exchange market. If you make investment in 
real estate, you should at least take into consideration the 
prospect and the potential value of the estate in that area... 
[JIDIAN RIBAO ellipsis] 
  After securities were officially issued for the first time 
in Shanghai in January 1985 and in Shenzhen in May 1987, four 
shareholding enterprises in Beijing also openly floated 175 
million shares of stock on the market at the end of March 1994. 
Stock which was once regarded as "torrential flood and wild 
beast" withstood the test of the reform program and is now 
available to the general public after nine years in one locality 
and seven years in another. This is something of great symbolic 
meaning on Mainland China. At a time when ordinary people in 
China, who had little sense of investment and never dreamed 
about becoming rich before are allowed to pursue capital gains 
with open arms, why should you hold your cash tight and worry 
about the plus or minus few percent of the inflation rate?

Statistics: "Statistical Bulletin on 1993's Economic and Social 
Developments"] 
  [Text] In 1993, under the leadership of the provincial 
party committee and the provincial government, the people acted 
diligently in the spirit of the 14th National Party Congress and 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee, 
focused on the development of the socialist market economic 
system, further liberated their thinking, seized the 
opportunities, overcame hardship, and went all out to promote 
socialist modernization. The national economy maintained its 
steady pace of development; its economic strength continued to 
grow, and the living conditions continued to improve. 
Preliminary data showed that the GDP for the year was 102.8 
billion yuan, a 4.9 percent increase over the previous year's. 
Specifically, the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries 
grew by 4.8 percent, 4.4 percent, and 6.1 percent, respectively; 
they account for 19.9 percent, 58.3 percent, and 21.8 percent of 
the GDP, respectively. The main problems in the economy were the 
presence of tight bottleneck sectors, industrial production's 
slow-growth, the lack of overall economic efficiency, and the 
fairly high rate of inflation. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  Agricultural production continued to grow. In 1993, the 
provincial party committee and the provincial government 
introduced a series of policies and measures to strengthen the 
agricultural sector and protect the peasants' interests and 
effectively mobilized the peasants' production enthusiasm. The 
year's GVAO [Gross Value of Agricultural Output] was 33 billion 
yuan, a 2.3 percent increase over the previous year's; the 
realized added-value came to 20.42 billion yuan, a 4.8 percent 
increase. In particular the planting industry's added-value was 
16.31 billion yuan, a 6.2 percent increase. 
  The mix of crops changed fairly drastically, and the 
planting 
area of good-selling, high-efficiency (value) crops was expanded 
while the area of low-efficiency (value) crops was reduced. The 
province's grain crop planting area totaled 7.558 million 
hectares, 209,000 hectares more than in the previous year. 
Specifically, 2.979 million hectares of soy bean was planted, 
81,900 hectares more than before; 93,00 hectares of mixed beans 
were planted, 41,000 hectares more than before; the planting 
areas for rice was reduced by 43,000 hectares, wheat by 27,800 
hectares, and corn by 389,999 hectares. Total grain production 
reached 23.908 million tons--245,000 tons, or 1.04 percent, more 
than in 1992, a year of bumper harvest; it set a historical 
record. Cash crop planting area totaled 591,000 hectares, 93,000 
hectares less than in the previous year. Planting areas for oil 
crops, flax, beet, and tobacco were reduced compared to the 
previous year. Total output of the main agricultural products is 
shown below:

  Forestry and afforestation work made good progress. In 1993, 
the province's forest industry realized 640 million yuan in 
added-value, an increase of 1.9 percent over the previous 
year's. It created 249,000 hectares of forest land, a 3.8 
percent increase. The quality of the created forests continued 
to improve, and forest fire prevention was strengthened. 
  Livestock production increased steadily. For the year, the 
livestock industry realized 2.998 billion yuan in added-value, a 
slight decline of 0.9 percent from the previous year. The 
following table lists the quantity of major animal products and 
the number of livestock on hand:

  Fishery products continued to increase. The industry's 
added-value came to 476 million yuan for the year, 5.8 percent 
more than in the previous year. Aquatic production came to 
189,000 tons, a 6.2 percent increase. In particular, the 
breeding industry's total output was 141,600 tons, a 9.2 percent 
increase. 
  Agricultural production conditions continued to improve. In 
1993, the province's chemical fertilizer utilization rate was 
1.002 million tons (converted to pure fertilizer), a 13.3 
percent increase over the previous year. The rural area's 
electricity usage came to 2.2 billion kwh, a 4.8 percent 
increase. By year-end the province had 11.853 million kw of 
power-driven farm machinery, a 1.1 percent increase. It had 
85,000 large- and medium-sized tractors, a 3.4 percent decline; 
387,000 small tractors, a 2.4 percent increase; 10,000 
heavy-duty trucks for farm use, same as the year before. It had 
1.369 million kw of power-driven drainage and irrigation 
machinery, 4.6 percent more than the year before; 77,000 
mechanical thresher, a 1.3 percent increase; 142,000 farm-use 
water pumps, a 6.0 percent increase. Irrigation and water 
conservancy projects continued to be strengthened, with 164,000 
hectares of effective irrigated area, 0.6 percent more than in 
the previous year. 
  The rural economy underwent comprehensive development. In 
1993, Heilongjiang's rural industry, construction industry, 
transportation industry, business and restaurants, and other 
nonagricultural sector's output value grew by 52.1 percent. They 
accounted for 50.3 percent of the rural society's total output 
value, up from 41.1 percent. Township enterprises achieved 
extraordinary, unprecedented growth -- the province's township 
enterprises' total output value topped 36.06 billion yuan, a 
53.1 percent growth compared to 1992. Their realized profit came 
to 2.24 billion yuan, a 52 percent increase. They delivered 1.03 
billion yuan in taxes, 40.3 percent more than a year ago. 
<H5>  II. Industry and Construction </H5>
  In 1993, enterprise reform which focused on the 
implementation of the "Provision" and its "Detailed Rules" to 
change enterprises' management mechanisms made important 
progress. Enterprises basically had the right to make management 
decisions, and the restructuring of the property rights system 
began to make new strides. Industrial production maintained a 
certain growth rate. For the year as a whole, the GVIO [Gross 
Value of Industrial Output] came to 131.61 billion yuan, a 6.2 
percent increase. Specifically, the state-owned industries 
produced 100.99 billion yuan's worth of goods, a 1.1 percent 
decline; collective owned industries produced 23.34 billion 
yuan's worth of goods, a 23.5 percent increase. Among the 
collective industries, the output value of township industries 
came to 5.28 billion yuan, a 51.1 percent increase, and the 
output value of village industries was 4.87 billion yuan, a 43.8 
percent increase. The output value of town and country 
cooperative industries came to 240 million yuan, a 38.6 percent 
increase; the output value of individual-owned town and country 
industries came to 5.72 billion yuan, a 56.8 percent increase. 
The "three kinds of wholly or partially foreign-owned 
enterprises" and industries of other economic components 
produced 1.56 billion yuan's worth of goods, increasing 1.08 
folds. The large- and medium-sized enterprises showed greater 
vitality; their GVIO was 85.79 billion yuan, a 3.2 percent 
growth. Among industries at the township and above levels, the 
output value of heavy industry topped 89.58 billion yuan, a 4.4 
percent increase; the output value of light industry topped 31.2 
billion yuan, same as the year before. For the year, industrial 
added-value came to 52.98 billion yuan, a 3.8 percent increase 
over the previous year. Total output of the major industries is

  Sales of industrial products improved somewhat in 1993, and 
the decline in industrial economic efficiency was halted to some 
extent. For the year, revenue from sales for the province's 
independently accountable industrial enterprises at the township 
and above levels came to 114.9 billion yuan, 41.3 percent more 
than in 1992. Total profit tax, after deducting the huge loss 
incurred by the Daqing Petroleum Administration resulting from 
China Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation's consolidated 
accounting, was still higher than 1992's. Revenue from sales by 
local budgeted industrial enterprises came to 32.28 billion 
yuan, an increase of 35.3 percent; total profit tax came to 1.88 
billion yuan, a 19.3 percent increase; 2.48 billion yuan in 
profit tax was handed to the higher authorities; 36 percent more 
than before. However, the finished products took up substantial 
current funds; payments in arrear for goods received were 
widespread. The overall economic efficiency was still rather 
poor. 
  The construction industry continued to thrive. In 1993, in 
the wake of the fairly sharp increase in fixed asset investments 
and the increasingly thorough reform of the industry, the 
construction industry generated 6.98 billion yuan in 
added-value, a 9.6 percent growth. Economic efficiency of the 
state-owned construction and building enterprises improved 
somewhat. The productivity of all workers came to 25,055 yuan, a 
31.2 percent increase. Their realized profit was 395 million 
yuan, a 54.4 percent increase; they turned over 490 million in 
profit tax, a 8.4 percent increase; they yielded 1,206 yuan in 
per capita profit tax, a 10.9 percent increase. They completed 
4.535 million sq m in total building area, a 24 percent decline 
from the previous year. 
<H5>  III. Fixed Asset Investments </H5>
  The increase in fixed asset investments accelerated. In 
1993, 
32.15 billion yuan of fixed asset investments were completed, a 
36.4 percent increase over the previous year. In particular, 
investments in local project came to 17.764 billion yuan, a 46.8 
percent increase. Among all investments, state-owned units 
accounted for 29.096 billion yuan; a 39.7 percent increase; 
collective units invested 754 million yuna, a 15.6 percent 
increase; individual investments accounted for 2.3 billion yuan, 
a 9.9 percent increase. Due to the central government's stronger 
macro regulation and control and its effort to sort out 
irregular projects and other measures, some bad projects were 
halted or delayed. For the year, the state-owned units had 3,719 
capital construction or transformation projects worth over 
50,000 yuan, which was 715 projects fewer than in the year 
before. That number included 2,569 new projects, 719 projects 
fewer than in 1992. Projects still under construction were worth 
88.84 billion yuan, a 17.2 percent increase over the previous 
year. 
  Among the state-owned units' investments, capital 
construction investments came to 14.525 billion yuan, a 44.4 
percent increase over the previous year; investments in 
transformation and upgrading came to 5.131 billion yuan, a 20.0 
percent increase; other investments by the whole people came to 
5.636 billion yuan, a 25.2 percent increase; commercial building 
investments came to 3.804 billion yuan, a 90.7 percent increase. 
  The investment-mix changed somewhat last year. Among the 
state-owned units' fixed asset investments, investments in the 
primary industry came to 367 million yuan, and its share of 
total investment fell from 2.7 percent in the previous year to 
1.3 percent; investments in the secondary industry came to 
17.185 billion yuan, and its share fell from 63.2 percent to 
59.1 percent. Specifically, investments in the energy industry 
came to 11.7 billion yuan; its share fell from 43.5 percent to 
40.2 percent. Investment in the tertiary industry came to 11.544 
billion yuan; its share rose from 34.1 percent to 39.7 percent 
of total investment. Specifically, investments in transportation 
and post and telecommunications came to 2.445 billion yuan; 
their share fell from 8.9 percent to 8.4 percent. 
  Key construction projects made good progress. In 1993, the 
province had 52 large- and medium-sized on-going capital 
construction and key construction projects and 48 above-quota 
transformation projects. Their investments came to 6.114 billion 
yuan and 814 billion yuan, respectively, which represented 
increases of 40.2 percent and 49.4 percent. Five large and 
medium-sized single-item projects and four above-quota 
transformation projects were completed and put to use. The 
state-owned units' newly added production capabilities included 
the following: They extracted 3.77 million tons of natural gas 
and 600,000 tons of raw coal, fell 70,000 cu meters of timber, 
installed 200,000 kw of power generating capacity, smelted 
131,000 tons of steel, brewed 25,000 tons of beer, and supplied 
100,000 tons of tap water per day, and installed 435,000 units 
of automatic exchange telephone in the cities. 
<H5>  IV. Transportations and Post and Telecommunications </H5>
  The transportations and post and telecommunications industry 
grew steadily. In 1993, it generated 5.367 billion yuan in 
added-value, a 5.7 percent increase over the previous year. But 
transportations and communications still could not keep up with 
the economic and social development; railroad transport was 
still very congested. The table below shows the volumes of 
shipment by all means of transportation:

  Development in the post and telecommunications industry 
continued. For the year, the industry generated 1.24 billion 
yuan in business, a 58.2 percent increase. Specifically, 166.40 
million pieces of mail were delivered, a 7.9 percent increase; 
640,000 pieces of express and special delivery mail were 
delivered, a 1.2-fold increase; there were 145.28 million 
long-distance phone calls, a 1.2-fold increase; there were 
171,000 electronic pager subscribers, a 1.1-fold increase; 9.785 
million telegraphs were delivered, a 19.9 percent decline; 
672.09 million publications were printed, a 1.4 percent decline; 
715,800 units of program-controlled telephone exchanges were 
installed in the cities, a 1.3-fold increase; 206,000 telephones 
were installed in the cities, doubled last year's; 613,600 
households were guaranteed telephones in the cities, a 50.3 
percent increase. 
<H5>  V. Business and Prices </H5>
  Market sales increased steadily. In 1993, the pace of reform 
in the circulation sector accelerated, promoting the development 
of the market system. There was ample supply in the consumer 
goods markets; buying and selling were brisk. For the year, 
society's total retail sales came to 48.48 billion yuan, a 12.3 
percent increase. Specifically, retail sale of consumer goods 
came to 44.647 billion yuan, a 13.2 percent increase; retail 
sales of agricultural means of production came to 3.829 billion 
yuan, a 3.3 percent increase. A breakdown of the increases in 
the volume of retail sales for economies of different components 
is as follows: Sales increased 4.8 percent in the state-owned 
economy; sales in the collective economy fell 2.5 percent; sales 
in the individual- and privately-run economies rose 39.8 
percent; the peasants' retail sale to non-rural residents rose 
28.6 percent. The number of country fair markets in the urban 
and rural areas grew to 1,873, with volume of transaction 
totaling 11.05 billion yuan, 42.7 percent more than in the 
previous year. In terms of the volume of sales of various types 
of consumer goods, in the food category, the sale of fresh eggs 
grew 30.9 percent; wine, 23.1 percent; and sugar, 3.3 percent. 
The sales of grains, edible oil, and pork fell by varying 
degrees. In the clothing category, the sale of silk and satin 
rose 4.2 percent. Among the durable goods, the sale of tape 
recorders went up 18.6 percent; cameras, 1.9 percent; all other 
sales fell somewhat. 
  Sales in the capital goods market were somewhat flat. In 
1993, the province's goods and materials supply and marketing 
enterprises bought 13.41 billion yuan's worth of capital goods, 
16.8 percent more than in the previous year. Their sales came to 
13.964 billion yuan, a 12.1 percent increase. As for the 
stockpile of the major types of goods and materials on hand, 
except for a 41.3 percent increase in steel materials and a 
slight increase in machinery and electronics equipment, the 
stocks of coal, lumber, cement, and automobiles fell rather 
sharply last year. 
  Price reform picked up speed and prices rose sharply. On top 
of the price reform in the previous years, the state continued 
to decontrol the prices of grain and iron and steel products and 
some centrally-allocated coal and readjusted and raised the 
price of raw timber and the factory-exit price of 
centrally-allocated cement. It also implemented the system of 
"converting parity prices to negotiated prices" for some types 
of crude oil. These measures played a very positive role in 
smoothing price relations, changing the chronic practice of 
under-pricing basic goods, and gradually setting up the 
mechanisms to let the market set prices, but they also caused 
the overall price level to rise sharply. For the year, the 
retail price index rose 14.6 percent, 6.1 percentage points more 
than in the previous year. Specifically, prices rose 14.2 
percent in the cities and 17 percent in the rural areas, 
exceeding the previous year's rates by 5.7 percentage points and 
10.1 percentage points, respectively. In the large- and 
medium-sized cities, the higher prices of grain, water and 
electricity, gas, school tuition and miscellaneous charges, and 
service charges had more serious impact, and the residents' cost 
of living rose sharply.

<H5>  VI. Foreign-Related Economy and Tourism </H5>
  In 1993, Heilongjiang further gave play to its border 
location and its openness to actively escalate its strategy of 
opening up to the outside world; its foreign-related economy was 
never busier. The year's foreign import and export were worth 
$3.05 billion, a 6.2 percent increase. Specifically, it exported 
$1.88 billion's worth of goods, a 2.9 percent increase; it 
imported $1.17 billion's worth of goods, a 11.4 percent 
increase. Its border barter trade was worth $2.07 billion in 
total import and export, a 29 percent increase over the previous 
year's. Of that amount, $1.14 billion were exports, a 34.7 
percent increase, and the imports were worth $930 million, a 
22.6 percent increase. 
  Foreign economic and technological cooperation made new 
breakthroughs. It successfully recruited businesses and 
attracted investments in Korea, and the Fourth "Har-Qia Meeting" 
was very satisfactory. In 1993, Heilongjiang signed a series of 
contracts with 35 foreign nations and regions to utilize foreign 
capital on 1,717 projects. This represented an increase of 86 
percent. The negotiated amount of foreign capital came to $1.09 
billion, nearly doubled that of the previous year's. Actual 
foreign capital utilization came to $300 million, a 1.7-fold 
increase. This included $230 million in direct foreign 
investments, a 1.3-fold increase. It marked a year with the 
highest foreign capital utilization rate since reform and 
opening up began. In the wake of the constant expansion of the 
scope of opening up, the number of "three kinds of wholly or 
partially foreign-owned enterprises" has increased 
significantly. Up to the end of 1993, the Department of 
Industries and Commerce has registered 2,900 FFEs, which was a 
1.2-fold increase over the previous year's number. 
  International tourism flourished. In 1993, the province 
received 116,000 foreign visitors, overseas Chinese, and Hong 
Kong and Macao and Taiwan compatriots who came to Heilongjiang 
on sightseeing trips, on tour, to visit relatives, and for other 
purposes. Tourism generated 75.42 million yuan in foreign 
exchange certificates, and increase of 2.3 percent. 
<H5>  VII. Finance and Banking </H5>
  Heilongjiang's financial departments actively expanded their 
sources of revenues while plugging loopholes and worked hard to 
complete the "full-platter project." Financial revenues 
increased steadily. Based on bulletin figures, the year's local 
revenues came to 10.75 billion yuan, completing 121.8 percent of 
the annual budget. Based on constant prices, this represented a 
17.4 percent increase in revenues. The financial expenditures 
came to 12.5 billion yuan, 94 percent of the adjusted budget, 
and based on constant prices, this represented a 10.7 percent 
increase in total expenditure. 
  Financial order clearly improve last year. At year-end, the 
province's banks and other financial insitutions had total 
deposits of 89.79 billion yuan, 13.32 billion yuan more than at 
the beginning of the year. New deposits increased by 17.4 
percent over the previous year's. Loans of all types totaled 
126.73 billion yuan, 22.84 billion more than at the beginning of 
the year. New loans increased 22.0 percent compared to the 
previous year. The cumulative credit loan balance came to 36.97 
billion yuan, 34.7 percent more than the previous year's 27.43 
billion yuan. For the year, the banks' cash income was 190.89 
billion yuan, 62.17 billion yuan or 48.3 percent more than a 
year ago; cash outlay came to 204.47 billion yuan, 63.75 billion 
yuan or 45.3 percent more than a year ago. Net currency input 
after offsetting revenues and expenditures was 13.58 billion 
yuan, a 1.58 billion yuan increase, which was 2.88 billion yuan 
less than the increase in the previous year; it represented a 
13.2 percent increase, which was 46.2 [as published] percentage 
points below the previous year's rate of increase. 
<H5>  VIII. Science, Education, Culture, Public Health, and Sports </H5>
  The in-depth reform of the science and technology system 
promoted the increasingly close integration of science and 
technology and the economy and the vigorous development of 
scientific and technological undertakings. In 1993, the province 
achieved results in 342 assorted scientific and technological 
projects, 13 of which attained advanced international standards, 
92 were pioneers or leaders among its kind nationally, and 194 
were considered the province's breakthrough projects. Among 
various scientific and technolgical achievements, two received 
the state's new invention award, three received the state's 
scientific and technological advancement award, four received 
the state's Spark Award for Science and Technology. Important 
scientific and technological achievements that won awards were: 
Dongnong No. 704 early-ripe, high-quality, disease-resistant, 
bumper crop, new variety of tomatoes; Model 3006 
intermediate-grade universal gear measuring apparatus;

applications were submitted to the state, 17.4 percent more than 
in the previous year; 1,917 applications were granted, a 
1.1-fold increase. 
  More money was on science and technology. In 1993, the 
province's scientific research institutions and colleges and 
universities and large and medium-sized enterprises spent 1.02 
billion yuan on science and technologies, a 2 percent increase. 
This included 180 million yuan spent on research and 
development, a 5.9 percent increase. The professional and 
technical contingent continued to grow. In 1993, the province 
had 1.309 million professional and technical personnel, 1 
percent more than a year earlier. 
  The technologies market further developed. In 1993, the 
province signed 6,633 contracts on technologies; they were worth 
790 million yuan, a 46.3 percent increase over the previous 
year's. In particular, the scientific research units turned over 
the results of 823 projects to the industrial enterprises. The 
technology transfers were worth 110 million yuan. 
  In 1993, the province had 191 product quality monitoring 
organs. The province also set up 69 launching pads for the 
ultrashort-wave weather warning service system. 
  Various educational undertakings also made new progress. The 
development of regular higher education picked up speed. The 
province recruited 1,723 graduate students, 27.5 percent more 
than in the previous year; 4,389 full-time graduate students 
were in attendance, a 12 percent increase. The regular colleges 
recruited 33,000 undergraduate and professional-degree students, 
14.6 percent more than in the previous year; 96,000 full-time 
students were in attendance, a 12.8 percent increase; 21,000 
students graduated, a 7 percent decline. Polytechnic education 
also developed at a steady pace. The polytechnic schools 
recruited 34,000 students, 42.9 percent more than the year 
before; 82,000 full-time students were in attendance, a 17.5 
percent increase. There were 123,000 students in the vocational 
middle schools, a 13.8 percent decline; 109,800 students were 
enrolled in the technical schools, a 3.8 percent increase. In 
the regular middle schools, 1.664 million students were in 
attendance, a 5.6 percent decline. Enrollment of school-age 
children came to 98.3 percent; 82.8 percent of the elementary 
school graduates went on to middle school, and 45.3 percent of 
the junior middle school students went on the senior middle 
school. Conditions in the elementary and middle schools 
improved. There were 1,660 kindergartens, with 605,000 children 
attending kindergarten, a 1.5 percent increase. 
  Adult education achieved new results; many types of 
technical 
training flourished. In 1993, colleges for adults accepted 
33,000 undergraduates and professional-degree students, a 18.7 
percent increase over the previous year; 84,000 full-time 
students were enrolled, a 6.3 percent increase. Adult 
polytechnic schools accepted 34,000 students, 42.9 percent more 
than in the previous years. For the year, 83,000 people learned 
to read. 
  Cultural undertakings continued to flourish. In 1993, the 
province had 94 artistic and performing groups; it had 1,430 
mass art galleries and cultural centers, 96 libraries, 23 
museums, 125 archives, 70 broadcast stations, 45 intermediate- 
and short-wave broadcast and transmission stations, 30 TV 
stations, 918 TV broadcast and transmission stations, and 7,012 
hours of programing. For the year, 31 TV shows were produced, 
six of which won awards. There were 12 original radio broadcast 
programs, six of which won awards. At year-end, there were 4,432 
assorted movie units that put on 304,000 shows. For the year, 
715 million copies of newspaper, 66.27 million copies of 
magazines, and 124 million books were printed. 
  Medical undertaking developed steadily, and public health 
conditions further improved. At the end of 1993, the province 
had 7,702 hospitals, convalescence homes, clinics, and other 
public health organizations. They had 127,900 beds, 0.6 percent 
more than in the previous year. There were 179,600 public health 
professionals and technicians, including 735,000 doctors (54,400 
were doctors of Western or Chinese medicine), and 50,900 nurses 
and therapists. 
  The province achieved outstanding results in the area of 
sports. For the year, it won 84 gold, 90.5 silver, and 94.75 
bronze medals in various large domestic and international 
competitions. Heilongjiang's athletes broke four world records, 
eight Asian records, and 12 national records. For the year, 
there were 3,600 above-county-level sports meets in which 2 
million people participated. Some 3.3 million people have met 
"state physical fitness standards." 
<H5>  IX. Population and the Living Conditions </H5>
  The rapid population increase was put under control. Based 
on 
a sample survey of 1993's population change in the province, the 
birth rate of 15.9 per thousand, a 0.035 percentage point 
decline; the death rate was 5.52 per thousand, a 0.06 percentage 
point decline. Because the death rate declined more than the 
birth rate, the natural rate of population increase was 10.38 
per thousand, 0.045 percentage point higher than in 1992. Based 
on these figures, the province's population in 1993 was 36.40 
million, 320,000 more than at the end of 1992, a 0.89 percent 
increase. 
  In 1993, the province took care of 214,000 unemployed 
workers 
in the cities and towns. At year-end, 8.803 million were 
employed in the province, same as in the previous year. This 
included 1.14 million working under the labor contract system in 
the state-owned units, an increase of 42,000 workers; they 
accounted for 17.8 percent of the total number of workers, up 
from 17.1 percent. The total wage bill for the year came to 
21.73 billion yuan, an increase of 10.3 percent. The workers' 
average money wage was 2,560 yuan, an increase of 11.5 percent, 
and after factoring in the higher prices, it represented a 4 
percent decline. However, nonwage income increased rather 
significantly. A sample survey of households in the cities and 
towns showed that the people's average regular income was 
1,745.5 yuan, 22.2 percent more than in the previous year, and 
after factoring in the higher prices, the actual increase was 
5.2 percent. 
  On top of the significant increase in the previous year, the 
peasants' per capita income surpassed the 1,000 yuan mark in 
1993. A sample survey of the rural households showed that the 
peasants' per capita income was 1,028.4 yuan, 79.2 yuan more 
than in the previous year, which was a 8.3 percent increase, and 
after factoring in the higher prices, the actual increase was 
2.1 percent. 
  The urban and rural population's savings increased fairly 
substantially. At the end of 1993, their savings balance topped 
58.27 billion yuan, 10.68 billion yuan more than in the previous 
year. Newly-added savings grew by 22.6 percent. Specifically, 
the urban population's savings increased 9.65 billion yuan, or 
22.9 percent; rural savings increased 1.04 billion yuan, or 20.9 
percent. The people were more aware of financial investments. 
Purchases of stocks and bonds and other negotiable securities 
increased significantly. 
  The urban and rural linving conditions further improved. In 
1993, the state spent 5.76 billion yuan on housing for workers. 
It represented a 71.4 percent increase in spending. They 
completed 7.768 million sq meters of housing, which was a 35.3 
percent increase. The urban residents' per capita living space 
was 6.4 sq meters, 0.2 sq meters more than in the previous year. 
The rural population's per capita living space was 14.53 sq 
meters, a 0.11 sq meter increase. 
  Social welfare undertakings continued to develop. In 1993, 
society took care of 42,000 orphaned, aged, disabled, and the 
young; 41,600 were actually taken care of by the towns and 
townships. There were 1,130 collective-run retirement homes; 
they accommodated 23,500 people. Specifically, 1,112 of the 
retirement homes were run by the towns and townships, and they 
accommodated 23,400 people. There were 27 social welfare 
institutions, children's welfare institutions, and mental 
hospitals ran by the civic administration departments, and they 
took care of 6,417 people. 
  The insurance business underwent further development. In 
1993, the province took in 215.1 billion yuan in premium for all 
kinds of insurances. The insurance business's total revenue came 
to 1.36 billion yuan, 14.3 percent more than in the previous 
years. The insurance business's total outlay came to 835 million 
yuan, a 57.7 percent increase. The province's insurance business 
handled 1.835 million claims and paid out 559 million yuan in 
compensation. 
  Environmental protection undertakings made good progress. In 
1993, the province's environmental protection system had 115 
monitoring stations and 3 state-class nature preservation zones. 
For the year, it completed 174 environmental clean-up projects 
and invested a total of 41 million yuan. Three hundred and 
thirty-four smoke and dust control zones were set up in 10 
cities; they covered an area of 572 sq km. One hundred 
ninety-five noise reduction zones were set up in 10 cities; they 
covered an area of 287 sq km.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporters Zhang Bosen (1728 2672 2773) and </F>
Gu Xiaoqian (7357 1321 0051) and New China News Agency reporter 
Wen Youcheng (5113 2589 2052): "Convert Resource Superiority 
Into Economic Superiority To Accelerate the Pace of Henan 
Development: An Interview With a Delegate, Henan Governor Ma 
Zhongchen"] 
  [Text] Premier Li Peng stated in the "Government Work 
Report": "This year's economic work should deepen reform, expand 
opening, strengthen and improve macroscopic adjustment and 
control, vigorously readjust the economic mix, promote 
technological progress, enthusiastically develop markets, 
improve economic efficiency, and control inflation to ensure the 
lasting, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy." What will Henan do? When interviewed by this reporter, 
the delegate, Henan Governor Ma Zhongchen [7456 1813 5256] 
stated, "We must speed up Henan's development by converting our 
resource advantages into economic superiority." 
  Delegate Ma Zhongchen said that Henan was located in the 
inner platform, so it is a major province for resources. There 
are 107 types of mineral products found in Henan, and among the 
verified mineral products, 49 are listed among the top ten 
nationally, including 12 types listed among the top three. The 
three energy mineral products of coal, oil, and natural gas, the 
four metal mineral products of aluminium, gold, molybdenum, and 
silver, and such non-metal mineral products as refractory clay, 
cement stone, salt, trona, solvent limestone, pearlite, and 
orchid asbestos are especially rich. The area is also very rich 
in arable land and output of agricultural products and 
by-products, with winter wheat, beans, cotton, and tobacco, as 
well as various fruits, and reserve quantities of large 
livestock all listed first in the nation. Transportation extends 
in all directions, the highways cover the province as densely as 
a spider's web, and air flights connect Henan with more than 20 
Chinese cities, Hong Kong and Japan. The North-South and 
East-West central coaxial cables intersect at Zhengzhou. 
Seventeen prefectures or cities and 83 counties (cities) have 
operational domestic direct dial telephones, with a provincial 
total of over 500,000 automatic exchange phones. Henan is first 
nationally in underground cultural relics, second in 
above-ground relics, and our museum collections rank third in 
the nation. Since reform and opening, we have made our base upon 
developing our resource superiority, and have made great 
progress economically. In 1993, Henan's GDP was up to 158 
billion yuan, a 15.7 percent increase over 1992, and 9.7 times 
that of 1978. 
  However, Delegate Ma Zhongchen pointed out that "Due to the 
affects of the economic division under the traditional economic 
system and limitations on capital and technology, Henan has not 
significantly altered its status of being a producing and 
exporting base for agricultural products, by-products, energy 
resource, raw materials and major primary level products, so we 
have not maximized our resource advantage, and our resource 
efficiency is not high enough. Viewed from the opposite angle, 
it demonstrates that the Henan economy has great potential for 
development. Therefore, the key to accelerating Henan's economic 
development lies in further releasing the huge potential its of 
resource advantages, doing our best to convert this resource 
advantage into economic advantage." Ma Zhongchen said firmly, 
with emphasis in his voice, "We have therefore laid out the 
general idea that developing Henan's economy in the future lies 
in accelerating the process of national economic marketization, 
implementing a comprehensive strategy for developing industry 
and agriculture. We must use the cities to promote the 
countryside, completely opening up and developing from a high 
starting point, facing toward both the overseas and domestic 
markets, going the way of deep processing with value adding 
driven by the resource advantages. Convert our resource 
advantages into economic advantage." 
  "But, how do you convert resource advantages into economic 
advantage?" the correspondent asked. 
  "First of all, we must strengthen the market economic 
concept, try to realize the four changes', and do a good job on 
three key points' of developing resource advantages." Delegate 
Ma Zhongchen explained that, "The so-called four changes' are, 
one, change from fixing projects according to resources to 
fixing them by market requirements; two, change from driving 
processing value adding by exploiting resource advantages into 
driving exploiting resource advantages by deep processing value 
adding; three, change from mainly facing inward for developing 
resources into developing resources facing the overseas and the 
domestic market, while giving special attention right now to 
developing export oriented industry, enterprises and products; 
four, change from developing and using solely local resources 
into a base of using both international and domestic, especially 
taking full advantage of foreign capital, technology, expertise 
and information resources, to realize bilateral compensation 
through the province's advantages in land, agricultural products 
and by-products, mineral products and labor force resources. 
  "Principally, the `three key points' are: 
  (1) Vigorously develop the deep processing of advantageous 
mineral resources, really working on five industrial systems: 
coal-electricity, coal chemicals, petrochemicals, aluminium and 
construction materials. 
  1. Focus on coal-electricity, vigorously developing deep 
processing for primary energy. Henan not only has rich coal 
resources, we are also close to two coal bases in southeastern 
Shanxi and Shaanxi, which is very favorable for development of 
the Kengkou and Lukou power stations. By the end of the century, 
we will build Henan into an important coal-electricity base with 
a 12 to 15 million KW generator capacity in the united national 
electricity network. We will try to add 3.5 million KW of 
generator capacity during the Eighth Five Year Plan, and will 
try to add 6.5 million KW during the Ninth Five Year Plan. 
  2. Develop the coal chemicals industry on the base of 
advantageous coal resources. Led by nylon 66 salt, based on coal 
tar processing, we are developing synthetic materials and fine 
chemical industry products while developing basic chemical raw 
materials. There are projects which have been set by the state, 
such as the Pingdingshan nylon 66 salt project, Pingdingshan 
coal tar project, Yima gas chemicals project, etc. 
  3. Make oil, natural gas-fuel, oil-chemical fibre and 
plastics a deep processing chain to develop the petrochemical 
industry. Relying on the oil and gas resources of the Zhongyuan 
Oil Field, Henan Oil Field and the five million tons of raw oil 
processing at the Luoyang Oil Refinery, we will gradually 
establish a Luoyang petrochemical industrial base focused on oil 
refining, chemical fibre and plastic production, a Puyang 
petrochemical industrial base focused on production of chemical 
fertilizer and ethylene, and a Nanyang petrochemical industrial 
base focused on high-density oil treatment and natural soda. 
  4. Make aluminium oxide-fine aluminium-aluminium 
materials-aluminium products an aluminium deep processing chain. 
As one of 20 projects being promoted by Henan Province, the 
Great Wall Aluminium Industry Corporation has an annual 
aluminium oxide production output of 1.2 million tons, aluminium 
electrolysis of 500,000 tons and 300,000 tons of aluminium 
materials. Among these, the first stage of a 200,000 ton 
aluminium oxide project at the Zhongzhou Aluminium Plant is now 
being completed. After completion, this project will be the 
biggest aluminium industry base in China. 
  5. Led by cement, glass, and advanced refractory materials 
in 
the construction materials industry, increase the pace of deep 
processing products by means of developing enterprises on an 
appropriate scale. Our hope is to establish industrial sectors 
which will be national leaders and correspond to our resource 
advantages. 
  2) Do a good job of adding value by deep processing in the 
sphere of "agriculture." 
  Gross output depends on the depth to which agricultural 
products are processed, that is. the final form of the product. 
Therefore, agricultural development in Henan will depend on how 
deep is the processing of agricultural products. We regard the 
deep processing of agricultural products and by-products as a 
breakthrough point for vigorously developing Henan's economy, 
and around "agriculture" will do a good job in the light textile 
industry to realize good circulation of promoting industry 
through agriculture and building agriculture through industry; 
focus on doing well the deep processing of nine big series and 
18 varieties of products, such as cotton-cotton 
processing-textiles-clothes, wheat-flour-fine foods, tobacco 
leaves-double curing-cigarettes, papermaking, winemaking, 
peanuts, corn, fruits and vegetables, comprehensive poultry and 
livestock processing, etc. We will gradually establish an 
industrial system for the deep processing and fine processing of 
agricultural products and by-products on a suitable scale and 
certain technological level. In this part of the work, we have 
attained certain achievements: Henan's monosodium glutamate and 
ham production are on a certain scale, with a very high sales 
rate in the domestic market. We have chosen to give priority 
in development to agriculture and its by-products, with food 
products, and to the textile industry as a leading industry, as 
well as bringing along other light industrial development such 
as papermaking, leather, medicine, etc. 
  (3) Exploit our geographical superiority and develop our 
cultural resources. 
  At present, we are making rapid progress in key 
infrastructural projects, with periodic achievements in such 
areas as transportation, telecommunications and tourism. Among 
10 tourism projects for exploiting cultural resources, there is 
the original site of the "foolish old man who moved the 
mountain" in Jiyuan, Kuilichen in Tangyin, the "little Yellow 
River" channel excavation in the Yellow River Daguan, the 
reconstruction project of digging a channel according to the 
"Qingming Shanghe Picture" in Kaifeng. These are in general 
completed and opened to tourists, while the construction of 
other projects is in full swing. Construction of the Henan 
Provincial Museum, which will exhibit the cream of Henan's 
antiquities, will be completed and the museum operational this 
year. 
  In order to bring about conversion from resource superiority 
to economic superiority, we must also adopt some practical 
measures, giving serious attention to implementation. In this 
regard, we plan to focus on giving force to the following five 
aspects: 
  One: add force to deepen reform, insisting on maintaining 
the 
dominance of public ownership, vigorously developing the various 
economic component parts. Of Henan's more than 149.3 billion 
yuan gross industrial output value at the town level and above, 
individual industry and "three types of capital" industry in 
urban and suburban areas is less than 20 percent, so there is 
great potential here. According to what is required to develop 
the socialist market economy, we must persist in the principle 
of developing whatever suitable economic component sector that 
fits, bringing the enthusiasm of each sector into full play, 
pushing the provincial economy to a new level. 
  Two: add force to improving the investment environment, 
expanding our opening toward the outside, with wide use of 
foreign capital, technology and human resources. At present, 
Henan is fully supporting construction of 10 major 
infrastructural projects, including Zhengzhou's new airport and 
a group of freeways. We are trying our best through 
environmental beautification and excellent service to provide 
the most favorable conditions for attracting foreign businessmen 
to invest in Henan in various forms, based on our resource 
superiority, and vigorously developing "three types of capital" 
enterprises. We are trying to exploit more than $1 billion in 
foreign capital in each of the last two years of the Eighth Five 
Year Plan. 
  Three: add force to pushing scientific and technical 
progress, improving the technological content of the domestic 
economy a great deal. Liberate scientific and technological 
workers, accelerating the conversion of high and new 
technological achievements to productive force. Meanwhile, make 
a major effort to replace technology in industrial enterprises. 
During the final two years of the Eighth and Ninth Five Year 
Plans, we plan to choose about 50 enterprises (groups) whose 
industrial sales productive output value are expected soon to be 
over 500 million yuan, to conduct a name brand strategy, 
concentrating capital to support their technology replacement, 
extend their products chain, cultivate leading edge products, 
establish economic scale, and produce economic giants. By the 
year 2000, we hope to achieve an average annual new increase in 
industrial marketing production output value of over 2 billion 
yuan, with taxes on profits of more than 200,000 yuan in these 
enterprises. It is very possible that key projects in areas 
which are capital and technology intensive, such as petroleum, 
chemicals, deep processing of nonferrous metals, electricity, 
etc., will start construction with designs which select 
internationally advanced technical equipment from the late 
eighties and the nineties. 
  Four: add force in amassing construction capital through 
multiple channels and forms, with a stress on key construction 
projects. In addition to vigorously exploiting foreign capital, 
vigorously develop a joint-stock system, taking fullest 
advantage of a variety of financial measures, such as stocks, 
bonds, etc., under the supervision of the state's policies. Take 
advantage of society's extra capital in multiple areas, at 
multiple levels, via multiple channels, in multiple forms and in 
multiple ways, accelerating construction of 20 development 
projects throughout the province, and increasing the staying 
power of economic development throughout the province. 
  Five: add force in bilateral economic coordination, 
welcoming 
coastal provinces to invest and develop resources in Henan. With 
the rapid development of the coastal economy, there is a growing 
demand by basic products for energy and raw materials, an area 
in which Henan has an exclusive superiority. We have instituted 
bilateral favorable and beneficial policies, and warmly welcome 
coastal and economic developed areas to co-exploit our 
province's resources, promoting co-economic prosperity.

  [Text] 1. Basic Character of National Specialized 
Banks and Reasons Why Their Reform Is Lagging 
  Greater emphasis on finance and banking and reform of 
finance 
and banking, characterized by a diversification of financial 
institutions, the use of new financial instruments, and the 
development of financial markets, has been going on in China for 
15 years (Xieping et al, 1992). However, these institutional 
innovations have taken place and have been promoted largely 
outside the specialized bank system. The organizational 
structure and the operating mechanisms of national specialized 
banks, which are the main financial business entities in China, 
have not been greatly reformed. In fact, the lag in their reform 
underlies the lag in all of China's finance and banking reform. 
Before analyzing the reasons for the lag in reform of national 
specialized banks, it is necessary to summarize the basic 
character of the national specialized banks (because, it is 
these characteristics that play a very great role in determining 
the internal structure and behavior of China's specialized 
banks): 1) Regionalized structure. From top to bottom, level by 
level, the Chinese specialized banks have set up branch banks 
based on administrative divisions (provinces, cities, 
prefectures, and counties). Consequently, the specialized banks 
are superficially individual banks in a unified national bank 
system when they are, in fact, several thousand relatively 
independent local banks. 2) Internal administrative ranking 
system. For historical reasons, the national specialized banks 
have had the character of government organs since the date of 
their founding. Thus, the banks have fashioned an internal 
"official standard" stimulus mechanism in which the pursuit of 
promotion is the ultimate concentrated expression of the 
individual effectiveness of bank staff members and workers. 3) 
Mixing of policy-related business with business-related 
business. 4) Government plan-controlled credit business. Because 
of the lingering influence of the planned economy model, the 
government regards the specialized banks as credit middlemen for 
plan distributions, and as intermediary institutions for 
payments and settlements, whose business is solely to ensure 
that planned financial distribution activities are performed. 
They have become an operating mechanism whereby production 
proceeds according to plan, and finance is subordinate to 
production plans. In a market economy environment, however, the 
specialized banks do market style business outside credit plans 
insofar as possible with a view to making a profit. In the 
absence of restraining laws and regulations, this kind of 
two-track system of doing business can easily lead to disarray 
in the financial trading order. 5) The industrial division of 
labor pattern among the four large specialized banks. At the 
working level, this industrial division of labor creates a 
situation in which a firm borrows, opens an account, and makes 
settlements only through a single bank, thereby producing a 
pattern in which a bank handles a firm's funds exclusively. 
The bank becomes a firm's largest creditor, thereby making it 
easy for the firm to shift risks to the bank. 6) Unified state 
control over income and expenditures as part of financial 
management. Evaluation of the specialized banks' business 
effectiveness and individual earnings have never been linked to 
profits; instead a semi-administrative agency-style unified 
state control over income and expenditures has been practiced in 
financial management. Some profit retention pilot projects were 
tried with some specialized banks (such as the Chinese Bank of 
Agriculture between 1989 - 1991), but without success. 
  There are two main reasons why it is so difficult to move 
ahead with reforms to convert the specialized banks into 
commercial banks as follows: First are internal reasons, i.e., 
the reasons created by the specialized bank's internal 
microstructure. Second are external reasons. Quite a few 
articles published in China have contained a fairly large number 
of analyses of the external reasons (Zhou Ziyuan [0719 5261 
6678], 1993; Xu Jian [6079 1696], 1992), but analysis of the 
internal reasons have been few. Many articles have said a great 
deal about reforms that the specialized banks should make, and 
they have even gone so far as to provide quite a few ideas about 
the reform steps that should be taken (Xu Maosen [5171 5399 
2773], 1993). However, just why reform of the specialized banks 
has lagged during the past 15 years has never been made clear. 
All these analyses imply one idea, namely, that the government 
has not really pushed reform of the country's specialized banks. 
If the government really wanted reform, it could move ahead with 
reform measures unimpeded. Indeed, many of the reforms that 
China has conducted during the past 15 years have been 
"compulsory institutional reforms" that the government has 
pushed. (Lin Yifu [2651 3015 1133], 1989) But why does the 
government fail to "apply pressure" only on the matter of 
national specialized bank reform. In China, reform of the 
national specialized banks has a bearing on many interest 
groups. To reform or not to reform, how much reform, and reform 
toward what goal depend on whether those that approve, support, 
and push these reforms are in an advantageous position to muster 
relatively more strength against opposing interest groups. (Hu 
Ruyin [5170 3067 6892]. National specialized bank reform is more 
difficult to promote than enterprise reform, foreign tarde 
reform, price reform, agricultural reform and taxation reform 
because these specialized banks play a special role in China's 
modern economic and political life. They have a bearing on 
interests in many quarters. Since this reform would lead to a 
substantial alteration of interest patterns, possibly it would 
be very risky. 
  1. Monopoly Position. The monopoly position of the 
specialized banks is a factor in the lag of reform in two ways: 
First, monopoly interests have led to insufficient motivation 
for internal reform. Now that financial markets have entered a 
situation of strong barriers, and a shortage of money, coupled 
with vigorous demand and a fairly tremendous gap between 
state-controlled interest rates and market equilibrium interest 
rates, the monopoly interests of the specialized banks are 
enormous. Under these circumstances, for the banks, keeping 
things the way they are is preferable to reform that would 
damage their monopoly position. Conversely, some reforms and 
policies that might benefit the specialized banks' monopoly 
position (such as central bank delegation of authority, 
elimination of credit controls, permitting the specialized banks 
to provide full service business, increasing cost deductions, 
increasing bad debt reserves, etc), the specialized banks do 
their utmost to promote. Thus, the course of finance and banking 
reform in China for the past 15 years has been weird. On the one 
hand, progress has been substantial in reforming the central 
bank's monetary policy and the development of financial markets 
while, on the other hand, the specialized banks' monopoly 
position has not changed in the course of reform. Meanwhile, the 
efficiency of these banks has declined, their services have not 
improved, their return on assets rate has fallen, and the 
percentage of their bad debts and overdue loans has risen. 
Second is the outward resistance created by oligopolistic 
interest relationships. By so-called outward resistance is meant 
the united resistance of the several specialized banks to 
external reform pressures. In 1986, 1988, and 1991, several 
efforts were made to implement substantive reform plans for the 
specialized banks, but none of them succeeded. This situation 
shows that since the several specialized banks monopolize the 
finance and banking business, a tacit agreement was reached 
among those sharing a common interest in certain quarters to 
block or weaken the central bank's reform plans or monetary 
policy. In fact, any major decision that the central bank makes 
must obtain the "approval" of the specialized banks before it 
can be put into effect. Sometimes "dialogue and consultation" 
(such as joint conferences and joint reports to the State 
Council) must be employed to solve problems. Unavoidably, the 
central bank must make "necessary compromises." 
  2. The government's related interests and hesitation. The 
government (including the central bank) has never been resolute 
on the specialized banks reform issue. The reasons for the 
insufficient external (government) reform motivation are as 
follows: a) fear that central government's revenues might be 
impaired. The business taxes and profits that China's 
specialized banks pay have always been a main source of revenues 
for the central government treasury amounting to about one-sixth 
of central government revenues. In view of the relatively great 
decline in the percentage of central government's fiscal 
revenues since 1987, this revenue has assumed greater 
importance. Consequently, when a given reform may impair the 
central bank's earnings, the central government usually finds it 
hard to be firm. b) worries about carrying out the government's 
economic policy intentions. For many years, the government has 
declared that the national specialized banks also have 
"macroeconomic regulation and control functions." Government 
direct participation in specialized bank business decisions has 
never changed. This has three aspects: One is that the 
specialized banks are responsible for all policy-related loans 
for government-designated purposes; second, a substantial 
portion of commercial loans flow toward the sectors or 
enterprises that the government favors, particularly loans to 
state-owned enterprises (at interest rates that are lower than 
the market equilibrium interest rate), which is actually a form 
of subsidy; and third, the total amount of specialized bank 
credit has a very great effect on total social demand. The 
prevailing system helps the government regulate and control 
total demand by controlling total credit. Therefore, when the 
existing specialized banking system fits in with the 
macroeconomic control system in certain regards, there can be no 
demand for "compulsory reform" for the time being. c) Certain 
technical factors. In the course of many years of operation, the 
specialized banks have constructed a huge and complicated 
internal system. Were this to be fundamentally reformed, 
government would not be able to deal completely with certainly 
technical matters such as how to split up institutions, 
placement and transfer of personnel, changes in the settlement 
system, rescheduling taxes, accounting and the division of 
accounts for policy-related business and commercial business, 
rescheduling creditors and debtors, relations with local 
governments, etc. Worries about these matter may magnify the 
risks of specialized bank reform with the result that it has 
never been possible to make a decision. 
  3. Other External Factors. The central government, the 
central bank, and the specialized banks themselves are the main 
decision makers in drawing up specialized bank reform plans. 
They consult with each other, and they haggle back and forth. 
However, in this decision-making process, certain external 
factors, or one might say "external conditions for reform" 
frequently become the main topic of discussion, or may even 
become the main factors affecting decisions. These factors 
include mostly the following: Since China has not yet set up a 
modern enterprise system, no strong restraints apply to 
enterprises' credit and liabilities. This is a decisive factor 
influencing the quality of specialized bank assets. No markets 
have yet been set up for the substantial flow of the key 
elements of production; thus, no profit equalizing mechanism has 
been formed. The entire interest rate system remains controlled; 
thus, interest rates cannot truly reflect the money supply and 
demand situation and money's opportunity costs. The finance and 
banking business' taxation system and fiscal system is unfair. 
They frequently have a fairly pronounced administrative 
interference coloration, etc. This situation has produced two 
points of view: One point of view maintains that it is necessary 
to wait until the above external conditions have been reformed 
to a certain extent before reform of the specialized banks can 
make any substantive headway. Only then can some reform measures 
be inaugurated. The other point of view maintains that China's 
current economic environment is not an obstacle to specialized 
bank reform. Both the specialized banks and the aforementioned 
external factors require substantial reform at the same time, 
but reform of the specialized banks happens to be lagging now. 
The author agrees with the second point of view. Actually, 
emphasizing the full necessity for external conditions for 
specialized bank reform is a "chicken or egg" argument for which 
there can be no solution. 
  4. The Non-Support Attitude of Local Governments. Under 
current conditions in China, local governments (particularly 
provincial governments) have no decision-making authority on the 
specialized bank reform issue. However, local governments do 
have substantial power to direct the credit business of 
specialized bank branches. "When the treasury has no money, go 
to the banks," is the usual rule. In the eyes of many local 
administrative officials, the local branches of specialized 
banks are a "second treasury." Therefore, the funds of the 
nationwide specialized banks are cut up by jurisdiction; credit 
is localized; and how credit is used is subject to local 
government interference. The main office not only is unable to 
move money around, but its branch cadres efforts to allocate and 
apportion funds frequently meet with refusal by or "a plea" from 
the local government. This is particularly the case regarding 
the credit business of specialized bank local branches and 
sub-branches, and matters closely related to administrative 
officers' "pet projects," and "career achievements." Frequently 
local funds shortfalls can be made up by having a specialized 
bank branch or sub-branch dun the central bank or the main 
office of a particular specialized bank. Therefore, local 
governments are largely satisfied with the present specialized 
bank pattern and its operating mechanism. They maintain an 
attitude of nonsupport for any reform plan that might change the 
present situation. This nonsupport attitude makes itself felt on 
ultimate decisions via various channels. 
  5. Enterprises Demand for Specialized Bank Reform Not 
Sufficient. As far as state-owned enterprises are concerned 
(particularly for large- and medium-sized enterprises on which 
decisions have a substantial effect), the limitations on 
specialized bank credit are very weak. For them, the specialized 
banks may be termed creditors, but they are actually suppliers 
of funds. The existing specialized bank set-up benefits 
state-owned enterprises. Consequently, the demand of state-owned 
enterprises for reform of the specialized bank is by no means 
urgent. On the contrary, were the specialized banks to become 
real commercial banks, only those able to repay would be issued 
credit. The poor would be scorned and the rich favored. The 
toughening of credit restraints poses a threat to state-owned 
enterprises. For numerous state-owned enterprises that depend on 
credit to carry on, in particular, reform of the specialized 
banks would confront them with the threat of bankruptcy. Large 
numbers of nonstate-owned enterprises are very dissatisfied with 
the specialized banks system because their possibility of 
obtaining credit from these banks is very small. Therefore, the 
urgency of their demand for reform is strong. However, 
nonstate-owned enterprises have no influence in the overall 
decision-making structure. 
  Summarization of the foregoing shows that from the 
standpoint 
of four main interest groups -- the specialized banks 
themselves, the central government, local governments, and 
enterprises -- external motivation and external demand for 
specialized bank reform is not great. This is another way of 
saying that the existing specialized bank system has had a 
"positive benefit" for the above four major interest groups for 
a certain period, and this is also the reason that reform has 
lagged. The fact is that this "positive benefit" stems from the 
tremendous amount of credit that the specialized banks grant 
every year, and this increase comes from the central banks 
credit (basic money) increase. It also comes from an increase in 
the cash balance that society needs in the process of 
monetarizing the economy. It is income derived from the issuance 
of money. During the next several years, the monetarization of 
China's economy will slow; thus, the surplus income that comes 
from currency issuance will decline. On the other hand, the 
specialized bank's loans in being will not turn over; the 
quality of assets will decline; and a latent crisis may appear. 
  2. Challenges that the Specialized Banking System 
Faces 
  The special bank system has been in operation in China for 
more than a decade. As market reforms intensify, the 
shortcomings of this system will become increasingly apparent. 
Therefore, some analysis of the lambasting and challenges that 
the specialized banks have borne in recent years will help 
clarify the objective model for specialized bank reform. 
  1. Development of Specialized Bank Foreign Financial 
Institutions. Since the advent of reform, very great advances 
have been made in the diversification of China's finance and 
banking institutions. The financial reform path formed outside 
of these banking institutions has now entered a new stage. Eight 
small commercial banks, foremost of which is the Bank of 
Communications, (including the Zhongxin Industrial Bank, the 
Guangda Bank, the Shenzhen Development Bank, the Guangdong 
Development Bank, the Fujian Enterprise Bank, the Shekou 
Merchants Bank, the Huaxia Bank, and the Pudong Development 
Bank) have been in business for only a short time. Nevertheless, 
all of their businesses have developed very rapidly. As of the 
end of June 1993, these banks had loan balances totaling 97 
billion yuan, or 4.53 percent of the 2.143 trillion yuan loan 
balance of the four large specialized banks for the same period. 
Their savings balance was 6.9 percent that of the four 
specialized banks. In addition, there are 380 trust investment 
corporations, 3,800 urban credit cooperatives, and 94 
foreign-owned or joint venture banks (or operating financial 
institutions). The financial institutions, other than the four 
large specialized banks, have begun to compete in savings, 
loans, settlements, and foreign exchange business with the 
specialized banks. In addition, the flexibility of their 
operations, their tight internal management, their high assets 
quality, and their superior services have attracted quite a few 
talented people and business from the specialized banks. In 
places such as Shenzhen and Guangdong, in particular, the market 
share of the specialized banks had declined to around 50 
percent. The administrative institution character, the 
cumbersome nature, the ossified management, and the not very 
high efficiency of the specialized banks puts them in an 
increasingly unfavorable competitive position. 
  2. The International Onslaught. With the development and 
widespread application of science and technology in every 
country of the world in recent years, and with the tremendous 
increase in the socialization and even the degree of 
internationalization of production and markets, financial 
reforms have been conducted on a global scale. In particular, 
the business and the organization of commercial banks have 
undergone profound and tremendous changes. These changes have 
entered China through international exchanges, and they stand in 
strong contrast to China's specialized bank system. The "model 
effect" that the development of banking outside China has 
engendered in China has stimulated pressures for reform in 
China. These pressures come from both within the specialized 
banks themselves and from outside. One onslaught that is 
particularly apparent is the outflow from the specialized banks 
of many expert cadres to foreign banks and other financial 
institutions. This has had a very great impact on the 
development of business in the specialized banks. The ossified 
system, technological backwardness, and the loss of skilled 
personnel poses an even greater hidden danger for the future. 
Such a lambasting also means that after China "re-enters 
GATT," when more foreign banks will enter China and may handle 
renminbi business, unless the specialized banks carry out basic 
reforms, they will be at a future competitive disadvantage. 
  3. Challenges From the Development of China's Market 
Economy. 
Since institution of a market economy, Chinese industrial and 
commercial enterprises have gradually shifted over to the market 
economy. Market economy principles have been incorporated into 
enterprises operating behavior. Enterprises demand for funds and 
financial services are also expressed in market law terms. Given 
this situation, the specialized banks, which mostly follow the 
former plan model, do not fit in with the market style 
enterprise system. For example, the operating plans that 
enterprises have drawn up to meet market demand do not mesh with 
the specialized banks' credit plans. When enterprises need 
money, no credit is available, but when they do not it, the 
banks urge credit on them. Non state-owned enterprises that are 
making good returns cannot get loans, but money losing 
state-owned enterprises have plenty of credit available. Thus, 
these state-owned enterprises may re-lend money at higher 
interest, or they may not repay the loans or rhwy may charge off 
the interest as a cost. When market interest rates are high, 
grassroots branches of the specialized banks use their money to 
make call-loans rather than for regular credit. By issuing 
call-loans, they can figure interest at the market rate [rather 
than at the government-set interest rate], and lend it and 
re-lend it making a commission on each transaction. The rise of 
real estate markets also lured some grassroots level branches of 
the specialized banks to invest. Risks were great and they lost 
money. By the end of 1992, the country's four large specialized 
banks had a net more than 100 billion yuan in short-term loans 
outside the system. This created havoc in the domestic financial 
order, the deepseated cause of which is the failure of the 
prevailing specialized bank system to fit in with development of 
a market economy. 
  4. Challenges of Finance and Banking Innovations. Finance 
and 
banking instrument innovations made in China between 1985 and 
1990 may be divided into seven categories: trust savings, 
commission savings, negotiable large amount certificates of 
deposit, national bonds, enterprise bonds, financial debentures, 
and stock. As of the end of 1991, these seven types of financial 
instruments accounted for 13 percent of total assets held by the 
nonfinance and banking sector and individuals. Moreover, all of 
the above financial instruments, with the exception of the 
financial debentures, were used by the specialized banks. Since 
the last half of 1991, China has faced another surge of 
financial innovations. In addition to a sharp increase in the 
amount of stock shares and enterprise bonds issued, new 
financial instruments include: shares issued to staff members 
and workers in enterprises, corporate shares, informal fund 
raising by enterprises and local governments, mutual funds, 
beneficiary bonds, stock warrants, and convertible bonds. 
Financial innovations have sparked the development of direct 
financing and a large scale outflow of funds in many directions. 
In 1992, the country's negotiable securities markets issued 128 
billion yuan worth of negotiable securities of all kinds, 
including 41 billion yuan worth of national bonds, 12.7 billion 
yuan worth of National Planning Commission National Investment 
Corporation bonds, 37.9 billion yuan worth of enterprise bonds, 
22.5 billion worth of financial debentures, and 11 billion yuan 
worth of stock. If shares issued within enterprises, the raising 
of funds outside plan, and such measures for which no statistics 
exist are added in, the People's Bank head office estimates the 
total at 250 billion yuan. This is 76 percent of the 329 billion 
yuan additional loans issued by the four specialized banks. 
These financial innovations and the outflow of funds through 
many different channels are actually a "backlash" against the 
existing specialized banking system. Since indirect financing 
in China has long been primarily through the specialized banks, 
unless the specialized banks conduct fundamental reform, 
continuation of this intermediation may threaten the effective 
operation of the specialized bank system. 
  5. Threats to the Macroeconomic Regulation and Control of 
Finance and Banking. For many years, the government's 
macroeconomic monetary policy acted on total social demand 
through the specialized banks. The specialized banks have been 
the microeconomic foundation for monetary policy. However, the 
situation during the past several years shows the actions of the 
specialized banks to be at odds with the market economy. Because 
of the effect of all sorts of external and internal factors, the 
loans that the specialized banks have issued have not flowed 
into high output sectors. The result has been a large number of 
dead loans. In addition, the specialized banks have used their 
monopoly position to "exert reverse pressure" on the central 
banks large increase in the basic money supply through devices 
such as "ensuring payment," "guaranteeing large and medium size 
enterprises needs for working capital," "backing the building of 
key construction projects," and no "issuance of IOUs." Since 
1992, in particular, the specialized banks have acted as a 
"funnel" for central bank basic currency through the use of 
short-term loans, joint investment with enterprises, and 
subsidiary corporation switch investments. As a result, money is 
added to the basic supply but never comes back. This can easily 
lead to credit inflation. Clearly, if the specialized banks 
themselves are not commercial banks that are self-limiting and 
bear risks themselves, this will hurt implementation of 
macroeconomic monetary policy in a market economy unless 
administrative measures such as the "high official mechanism" is 
used (General Planning Research Team, 1992). Faced with the 
current specialized bank system, market-oriented monetary 
policies will become increasingly ineffective. This threat is 
also one of the motivations for government and central bank 
determination to reform the specialized banks. 
<H5>  3. Object Model for Specialized Bank Reform </H5>
  The goal of national specialized bank reform is presently 
clear. It is to make them into truly commercial banks. This 
holds three different levels of meaning: The first is the need 
to regard commercial banks as an industry, putting reform of the 
specialized banks into the context of industrial reform and not 
looking at it solely from the angle of individual banks. Second, 
it means that the four specialized banks will not necessarily be 
converted into four commercial banks. They might be converted 
into even more commercial banks. This would help shape a 
competitive environment. Third, the ultimate goal of this reform 
is to improve banking business returns and to promote the 
allocation of financial resources through the market. It is not 
reform for reform's sake. 
  Furthermore, since the specialized banks are a distinctive 
economic organization in China that are large in size and 
strongly monopolistic, the measures taken to reform them should 
be different. First of all, reliance on "gradualist" methods 
generated outside the system are not likely to be effective. The 
time required will be protracted; thus, competitive markets will 
not be formed for a long time. Second, unlike the reform of the 
enterprise system, since there are only four specialized banks, 
reform of the specialized bank system becomes reform of the 
internal organization of four separate specialized banks. At 
this time, institutional reform and internal reform of the 
economic organization will coincide, i.e., external reform 
impetus being applied directly to reform the organization 
internally. 
  1. Destruction of the Specialized Banks Monopoly Position. 
Currently, there are four different ideas about this issue: One 
is to loosen banking business market access under strict 
standards (General Planning Research Team, 1992), permitting the 
founding of new banks. The second is to permit the several 
already existing small banks, such as the Zhongxin Industrial 
Bank and the Guangda Bank, to do business across province lines 
to foster the formation of nationwide banks. Third is to permit 
the founding of civilian-run banks (Fan Gang [2868 4854], 1993). 
Fourth is to divide up the four specialized banks into several 
banks by province or region (World Bank, 1993). Even though the 
feasibility of these ideas awaits validation, the basic idea of 
destroying the specialized banks monopoly position is correct. 
  2. Separation of Policy-Related Banks and Specialized Banks. 
As a result of many years validation, the government, the 
central bank, and the centralized banks have reached a consensus 
on this issue, and it has been spelled out in the State 
Council-approved financial reform plan (Chen Yuan [7115 0337], 
1993). 
  3. Reform of the Specialized Banks' Organizational 
Structure. 
a) Structural reorganization of China's industrial and 
commercial banks: While retaining the framework for the main 
office and branch system, the provincial branches should be 
abolished, 40 to 60 urban branches being placed under direct 
jurisdiction of the head office, these branches retaining about 
80 percent of existing savings deposits. These urban branches 
would be operating branches doing business directly with 
business enterprises and not administrative banks as formerly. 
The remaining branches would be organized as regional savings 
banks in a head office and branch bank system, doing business 
within a specific province. Their capital could be augmented 
through the issuance of corporate shares, and their business 
would attract business enterprise and individual savings 
deposits. They would provide short-term credit, settlement of 
accounts, and other retail services to industrial and commercial 
firms. b) Structural reorganization of the Chinese Bank of 
Agriculture: Once agricultural policy-related banks have been 
founded, the existing Chinese Bank of Agriculture would become a 
Chinese agricultural cooperative bank system. The Chinese 
Agricultural Cooperative Bank would have a head office (at the 
national level), but it would no longer be like the present 
all-encompassing large bank with a headquarters and branches but 
rather a multilevel corporate system. The head office's funds 
would come from purchases of shares by regional level 
agricultural cooperative banks and, aside from regular 
commercial bank business, its main business would be to balance 
financing among the regional agricultural cooperative banks, and 
to standardize the system's regulations and dealings with 
foreign countries. The present Bank of Agriculture provincial 
branches would be eliminated. Branches and sub-branches below 
the provincial level, and local rural credit cooperatives having 
requisite conditions would be amalgamated through the share 
system into a multitude of agricultural cooperative banks. They 
would be divided into grassroots level banks (county or 
township) and prefecture or municipal banks, all of them being 
independent corporate entities. c) Changes in the structure of 
the Bank of China and the Chinese People's Construction Bank. 
These two banks would become commercial banks retaining intact 
their head office and branch system, but the provincial level 
bank level would be abolished. From among the numerous first 
level urban branch banks, regional banks in charge would be 
selected as was the case with the Bank of China organizational 
structure before 1986. The main purpose of these changes is to 
weaken the direct relationship between the existing specialized 
bank provincial branch banks and local governments in the 
provinces, to prevent the regionalization of provincial branch 
banks, and to enhance head office regulatory authority and 
capabilities. 
  In discussions of reform within the specialized banks during 
recent years, the cry for decentralization of authority over 
provincial level branch banks has been very loud. (This is 
related to local government support.) These banks want a greater 
delegation of autonomy to provincial and prefectural branch 
banks, and they maintain that this is the only way to increase 
the operating efficiency of the specialized banks. Actually, 
this is a mistaken understanding. If a commercial bank system of 
a head office and branch banks is adopted, externally the bank 
would be an independent corporate entity, and internally there 
would be no need for market dealings among branch banks. If 
corporate or semi-corporate entity status is conferred on branch 
banks, and market trading is done internally among branch banks 
(such as making short term loans, savings and loan business, and 
securities trading back and forth), that would demonstrate that 
the bank has not attained the optimum returns of scale, and that 
it should be divided up into several banks or become a 
multilevel corporate system group bank. The twisted 
organizational structure of the specialized banks in China today 
is due to this: Outwardly, they are a single bank, but 
internally, the operating autonomy among branch banks is very 
great. They conduct market trading among themselves, and branch 
banks even sign external contracts without authority of the head 
office. This blurs the line between the market and enterprises. 
It is an expression of the mixing of equity rights. 
Consequently, beginning with the equity structure in 
reorganizing the national specialized banks holds great 
significance. The author believes that once policy-related banks 
are set up and the "Corporation Law" is passed, the Chinese 
Industrial and Commercial Bank, the Bank of China, and the 
Chinese People's Construction Bank may be transformed into a 
full capital state-owned limited liability corporation and, once 
conditions are ripe, this may be changed into a stock share 
limited liability corporation. 
  4. Elimination of government administrative interference in 
the specialized banks. Once they have been transformed, as full 
capital state-owned commercial banks, the specialized banks 
should have the following relationship with the government: 
First, the government should have decision making authority only 
about the hiring and firing of the director of a commercial 
bank's head office, and it may not concern itself with internal 
bank personnel matters. This is the most crucial point, namely a 
a clear-cut client-agent mechanism. The specialized banks would 
have a vertical system, and the provincial government and 
governments below the provincial level would not interfere with 
personnel matters within the bank. Second, no level of 
government could interfere in the specialized banks' credit 
business. Third, the state-owned commercial banks would set up a 
board of supervisors, the board of supervisors personnel to be 
selected by the government (most of them coming from outside the 
bank). The board of supervisors would be empowered to supervise 
and examine the state-owned commercial bank's business plan and 
how well the value of state-owned capital was being maintained 
and increased. It would supervise, evaluate and note the 
performance of the bank director, and make recommendations on 
hiring, firing, rewards, and penalties. 
  5. Integrated business orientation. Once China's specialized 
banks have been transformed into state-owned commercial banks, 
the integration of their business orientation is inevitable. The 
position of commercial banks in providing short-term loans to 
industrial and commercial enterprises is well established. 
Throughout the world today, the business of commercial banks 
that have a head office and branch bank system shows a universal 
trend toward diversification and all-inclusiveness, and this 
trend has also been quickly transmitted into China. Although 
China's specialized banks have nominally maintained the business 
separation system whereby they could not deal in securities or 
investment, in fact, they did do every kind of business through 
separate trust investment corporations. Therefore, the issue is 
not a separate business system or a comprehensive system per se, 
but on what kind of foundation to build an oversight framework. 
If the specialized banks become commercial banks that account 
independently, are responsible for risks, are self-limiting, 
have autonomy in operation, and are responsible for their own 
profits and losses, and strict oversight measures also apply to 
them (such as the make-up of their assets and proportional 
limits standards, assets responsibility proportional standards, 
and independent operation agent proportional standards), the 
integration of its business will not carry a very great risk. 
Instead, this will help mesh China's finance and banking with 
international finance and banking. The key issue is oversight, 
not what kinds of business the bank does.

Series of Discussions on the New Tax System: "The New Features 
of the New Industrial and Commercial Tax System"] 
  [Text] Editor's note: Since the new tax system went 
into effect at the beginning of 1994, the JIDIAN RIBAO editorial 
department has received many letters from our readers, reporting 
a lack of understanding of the substance of this tax reform, and 
hoping that we would fill them in on it. In response to these 
requests, the editorial department has invited the Ministry of 
Machine Building and Electronics' Economic Regulation and State 
Assets Oversight departments to write a series of articles on 
the new tax system, which we are carrying here successively for 
reference by our large numbers of readers. 
  In the new tax system that went into effect at the beginning 
of 1994, what actually are the new features? The new parts are 
in contrast to the old system. Our former industrial and 
commercial tax system was formed after the 1984 substitution of 
taxes for profits and the overall reform of industrial and 
commercial taxes and profits, being a multi-tax and -profit, 
multi-link, and multi-level compound tax system with 32 tax 
caegories, the major ones being the flow and income taxes, 
complemented by related auxiliary tax categories. But it was 
not adaptable to our socialist market economy development, being 
hard to play the proper regulatory role in the area of dealing 
with the distribution relations among the state, enterprises, 
and individuals and between the center and localities, which was 
adverse to the formation of China's large uniform market and the 
implementation of our state industrial policy. 
  The new tax system reforms old-system defects, such as 
nonuniform tax laws and tax administration, a too complicated 
tax system, too many and indiscriminate tax preferences, and an 
ever-growing gap between nominal tax rates and real tax burdens, 
so will be bound to bring stability and prosperity to economic 
activities, mainly as follows: 
  --It will contribute to fair tax burdens, promoting 
equal competition. The former enterprise income tax 
categories were set up with tax rates varying by respective 
ownership systems, with large- and medium-sized state 
enterprises subject to a 55-percent proportional [flat] tax 
rate, private enterprises subject to a 35-percent flat tax rate, 
and small state enterprises and collective enterprises subject 
to an eight-grade progressive tax rate for excess income. The 
new tax system sets the enterprise income tax rate at 33 
percent, while giving the proper consideration to small 
enterprises with smaller annual incomes by setting two 
additional lower tax rates, to consolidate the tax laws and 
regulations for domestic-invested enterprises [DIEs]. As 
enterprises of all ownership systems use the same financial 
accounting principles, when calculating income taxes, they all 
adjust taxable income based on the provisions of the income tax 
laws and regulations, with the tax provisions on reductions and 
exemptions also becoming more consistent, thus consolidating 
taxable income criteria. While the former flow tax system 
included the three tax categories of value-added taxes, product 
taxes, and business taxes, the new flow tax system uses a dual 
regulatory system of general regulation through value added 
taxes and special regulation through consumption taxes in 
coordination with business taxes, overcoming the old tax 
system's irrational phenomena, such as duplicate collections and 
overlapping regulatory functions. As the new tax system 
consolidates the internal and external flow tax system, as well 
as gradually consolidating other internal and external tax 
categories, it paves the way for the operation of a uniform and 
equal tax policy in the same market climate for DIEs and FIEs of 
all economic-ownership components. 
  -- It will help to rationalize the distribution 
relations among the state, enterprises, and individuals. 
Certain too high tax rates in the old tax system were hard for 
enterprises to bear, with its host of preferential policies hard 
for the revenue sector to deal with. Local governments and 
responsible departments also used various pretexts to collect 
sizeable amounts from enterprises through means, such as 
management fees, various funds, and set-asides. 
Contract-enterprise income taxes made enterprise income taxes 
exist in name only, as well as making for a confusing dual 
status for the state as both public manager and state-enterprise 
assets owner. The new tax system eliminates income-tax 
contracting, contributing to the conversion of both enterprise 
operating forces and government functions. The new tax system 
eliminates the "state enterprise regulatory tax" and the 
collection from state enterprises of state transportation and 
priority construction funds and state budget-regulation funds, 
not only lightening enterprise burdens, but also changing this 
nonstandard distribution form between the state and enterprises. 
For instance, the state-enterprise income tax rate had reached 
55 percent, with some having to pay profit-regulation taxes, 
causing enterprise difficulties that forced the adoption of 
tax-reduction and -exemption measures, causing a phenomenon of 
high tax rates, many preferences, a narrow tax base, and low tax 
burdens, and eroding the tax base to cause a large loss of 
revenue. The new tax system will change this situation of 
reductions by the state and enterprise insustainability. In the 
old tax system, as to individual income taxes, foreigners were 
subject to the "Individual Income Tax Law," Chinese citizens to 
the "Interim Regulatons on Individual Income Regulation Taxes," 
and individual industrial and commercial household operations to 
the "Intermim Regulations on Urban and Rural Individual 
Industrial and Commercial Household Operation Income Taxes," 
with three taxes coexisting. This was hard to interpret in both 
legislation and execution, as well as being out of line with 
international practice. The new tax system provides for 
individual income taxes to be collected mainly on higher 
incomes, with lower or no taxes on middle and low incomes, 
helping to regulate the personal income gap, as well as 
alleviating the conflict of social distribution injustice. 
  --It will help to delimit central and local revenue and 
tax management jurisdiction, to meet the needs of tax 
sharing. As the market role in the disposition of resources 
has expanded steadily, the flaws of the former revenue package 
system have grown ever-more evident. The division of tax 
categories in the new tax system considers not only income 
distribution between the center and localities, but also the 
regulatory impact of taxation on economic development and social 
distribution. All legislative authority for central taxes, 
jointly-shared taxes, and local taxes is concentrated in the 
center, to ensure uniform central government decrees, and to 
preserve a nationally uniform market and equal enterprise 
competition. The taxation uses graded collection, with central 
and shared taxes collected by the central tax agency, the local 
share of shared taxes deposited directly into local treasuries 
by the central tax agency, and local taxes collected by local 
tax departments. This will help economically developed regions 
to continue to maintain a faster growth momentum while, through 
central-revenue return and transfer payment of taxes to 
localities, supporting the development of economically backward 
regions and the upgrading of old industrial bases. 
  --The new tax system streamlines and standardizes tax 
categories. The elimination of tax categories not suited 
to economic development, merging of duplicate tax categories, 
and installation of certain necessary tax categories, will 
contribute to tax-system simplification and efficiency. For 
instance, we have switched all of the products previously 
subject to product taxes to value added taxes, as well as 
selecting 11 products, such as tobacco, alcohol, cosmetics, 
expensive jewelry, and small motor vehicles, for collection of 
consumption taxes in addition to value added taxes, to reflect 
the principle of essentially maintaining the previous tax 
burden. The new system's business taxes have been expanded 
appropriately to include not only DIEs and units, such as state, 
collective, and private enterprises, and operations by Chinese 
citizens, but also FIEs and foreign enterprises. While the 
old business-tax collection scope involved secondary industries 
and all tertiary ones, the new business tax can include in 
principle operations that provide taxable services, transfers 
of invisible assets, and sales of real property. The new 
business-tax taxable items are reduced from 14 to nine, with the 
27 tax rates in four grades reduced to nine in two grades. The 
collection of value added taxes on land can appropriately 
regulate excessive real estate transaction profits. The urban 
and rural construction maintenance tax will become one of the 
key tax categories in the local tax system. Other revisions of 
tax categories are: 1) we have abolished the rural market 
transaction, livestock transaction, oilburning special, bonus, 
and wage regulation taxes; 2) we have made the special 
consumption tax a consumption tax with a special regulatory 
role; 3) we have eliminated the collection from FIEs and 
foreigners of urban real estate and car- and boat-use license 
taxes, collecting uniform real estate and car-and boat-use 
taxes, and suitably raising currently too low tax rates and 
payments; 4) we have devolved authority to localities for 
slaughtering and banquet taxes; 5) we are collecting inheritance 
taxes. 
  Through this tax reform, China's new industrial and 
commercial tax system will have the 17 tax categories of value 
added, consumption, business, individual income, enterprise 
income, FIE and foreign-enterprise income, resource, urban land 
use, land value added, urban and rural construction maintenance, 
real estate, car and boat, fixed asset investment orientation 
regulation, stamp, securities transaction, inheritance, and 
slaughtering taxes.

"Commercialization of S&amp;T Achievements Plagued by Eight 
Problems"] 
<H5>  [6 Apr p 3] </H5>
  [Text] For the nation as a whole, whether or not scientific 
and technological [S&amp;T] achievements are promptly transformed 
into productive forces is a vital issue that will determine 
whether the Chinese economy will grow steadily and rapidly in a 
sustained fashion and whether the Chinese people can proudly 
take their place among the nations of the world. For an 
enterprise, it is also a paramount issue that will decide 
whether or not it will hold its own on the market where 
competition is becoming more and more ferocious. Thus far we 
have been less than adept at handling these two major issues, 
with the result that the transformation of S&amp;T achievements 
is 
plagued by eight major problems. For the enterprise, there is no 
running away from these obstacles either. What are these eight 
obstacles? How can we overcome them? This article will run a 
series of five articles starting today. We will begin by 
discussing the eight factors that hamper the transformation of 
S&amp;T achievements into productive forces. Next we will look at 
S&amp;T work in the United States and Japan and find out how 
S&amp;T 
achievements there are turned into productive forces. Will the 
series of articles set our readers thinking and making mental 
associations? Will they come up with some good suggestions about 
S&amp;T work in China and the transformation of S&amp;T 
achievements? 
Jot them down and mail them to us; S&amp;T work needs 
participation 
and strategizing by the public. 
  -- The effective energy utilization rate in China is only 
two-thirds that of advanced nations. 
  -- The large-area dissemination and application rate of 
S&amp;T 
achievements in China is merely 15 percent. 
  -- Only 4 percent of China's high-tech products are 
exported. 
  -- Only 34.5 percent of China's national-level major S&amp;T 
achievements are commercialized. - China spends a mere 0.71 
percent of its gross domestic output on research and development 
[R&amp;D]. 
  -- There are eight major problems in the transformation of 
S&amp;T achievements in China. 
  Importance and Urgency 
  The Chinese economy has been expanding rapidly in recent 
years. Rapid growth, however, masks such problems as poor 
productivity, low profits, irrationality in the industrial 
structure, and lack of competitiveness. These problems will 
inevitably crimp further economic growth. 
  China's international trade has grown significantly in the 
last few years, with exports almost hitting $400 million in 
1992. Ten years ago, China accounted for 1 percent of global 
trade; now its share has risen to 2.5 percent. Manufactured 
goods used to make up 50 percent of Chinese exports; to date 
they constitute 80 percent. Nevertheless, most of the increase 
in exports still occurs in labor-intensive industries like 
textiles and footwear. Chinese exports enjoy an edge--in price, 
not in quality or technological content. 
  China is a relatively resource-poor nation. In this nation 
that requires 1.1 billion tons of standard coal each year to 
keep the economy growing, however, the effective energy 
utilization rate is only two-thirds that of advanced nations. In 
China, for instance, it takes 400 grams of coal to generate one 
kwh of electricity, 100 grams more than other nations. We 
consume 30 percent more energy than elsewhere to manufacture a 
ton of steel, 70 percent more to make a ton of cement, and 100 
percent more to turn out a ton of glass. 
  To sum up, China must rely on S&amp;T progress and 
accelerate the 
transformation of S&amp;T achievements if the Chinese economy is 
to 
continue to grow steadily and healthily for a long time to come. 
  Present Situation And Gap 
  Some research units have calculated the rates of 
contribution 
of S&amp;T progress to economic growth since reform went under 
way 
and the open policy was introduced: 16 percent in the 1980's and 
rising to 20 percent in the 1990's. Transactions on the 
technology market rose from 2.1 billion yuan in 1985 to 15.6 
billion yuan in 1992, a 640 percent gain. The rate of the 
large-area dissemination and application of S&amp;T achievements 
is 
only 15 percent. According to classified standards statistics 
compiled by the General Administration of Customs, while 
high-tech products made up 4 percent of China's total exports in 
the 1980's, the corresponding figures for other newly 
industrialized countries [NIC's] during the same period ranged 
from 10 to 15 percent. New products accounted for 32 percent of 
total sales by U.S. firms in 1986; the projected figure for the 
1990's is 50 percent. 
  We can see from the above data that although China has made 
significant headway in S&amp;T achievements transformation since 
reform went under way and the open policy was introduced, it 
still trails the developed nations and the NIC's. Without a 
wealth of new products with S&amp;T content, it will be 
impossible 
for China to beat the competition on the world market in the 
months and years ahead. Thus identifying the structure that will 
accelerate S&amp;T achievements transformation has become a hot 
topic in the S&amp;T policy debate in China. 
  Problems and Difficulties 
  -- Institutional barriers. Scientific research versus 
production. High-tech research versus traditional industrial 
transformation. Making use of industry-based technical centers 
versus raising the technical standard of enterprises. Importing 
technology versus developing it on our own. Problems abound when 
it comes to planning comprehensively and coordinating and 
balancing the two sets of issues, revolving around the nation's 
priority tasks. Our S&amp;T work is characterized by large-area 
low-level duplication. Numerous S&amp;T achievements are not 
effectively and promptly applied in production. The same piece 
of technology may be imported many times over, which prevents 
what limited funds we have from being utilized properly. All 
these problems are commonplace. They involve not only the 
macro-management of the economic system and S&amp;T system, but 
also 
the sound division of labor and optimal configuration of such 
systems. To effectively marry S&amp;T with the economy at a high 
level, we must improve the existing S&amp;T management system and 
economic planning management system and establish a mechanism 
whereby scientific research organizations and institutions of 
higher education can participate in major national economic 
projects. 
  Developed nations have taken a host of measures in recent 
years to speed up S&amp;T advances, economic growth, and S&amp;T 
achievements transformation. Take the United States, for 
instance. The U.S. Government has stepped up the 
macro-management of science and technology in recent years, 
doubling its attention to the role played by research and 
consulting in S&amp;T decision-making. Former President George 
Bush 
elevated his scientific adviser to presidential assistant, equal 
in standing to the assistant to the president for national 
security affairs, who could participate in national economic and 
security policy-making at the top level. In February 1990 he 
revived the Presidential Scientific Advisory Commission and put 
it on a par with the Council of Economic Advisers. This was 
followed by the restructuring and strengthening of the Federal 
Scientific, Engineering, and Technological Coordinating 
Committee to enable it to play an even more extensive role in 
inter-departmental S&amp;T policy coordination. It was precisely 
because of the heavy involvement of the U.S. Government that the 
United States was able to turn the tide in the global computer 
chip war and beat Japan. 
  -- Weak consciousness. With its huge population and poor 
foundation, China is economically and culturally backward. In 
China the development of social productive forces is hampered by 
a variety of serious constraints: demographic, resource, and 
environmental. Traditionally we have tried to develop the 
economy by consuming huge amounts of resources. Efficiency was 
low and social productivity was equivalent to barely 5 percent 
of the best in the world. We will be doomed if we do not size up 
the times and grasp the opportunity with a sense of urgency and 
a sense of crisis and truly base economic construction on S&amp;T 
advances and the improvement of the quality of the labor force. 
The new global technological revolution is more than an economic 
challenge to us, it is also a political challenge. The more 
economically and culturally backward a nation, the greater its 
need to make science, technology, and education its top priority 
and put them to use to achieve a quantum leap in the development 
of productive forces and productivity. In this area we should be 
more alert, more conscious. 
  The relations between S&amp;T, on the one hand, and the 
economy, 
on the other, has never been properly straightened out over the 
years. Agencies which manage S&amp;T and their counterparts in 
charge of the economy have been converging institutionally and 
overlapping functionally. In the process, we have ignored to 
achieve a sound division of labor between the two. Meanwhile, 
departmentalism, localism, both byproducts of the 
small-agriculture mentality, and the idea of preventing an 
outflow of profits have also inhibited the formation of a 
fruitful partnership between S&amp;T and the economy. 
  If cadres at all levels continue to fail to truly appreciate 
the importance of S&amp;T and remain content with the kind of 
short-term progress resulting from continued extensive 
development, if they still do not realize the danger posed by 
the widening gap with the West and fail to think in terms of the 
nation's general interests, then the future looks grim as far as 
China's four-modernization drive is concerned. 
  -- Institutional malfunctioning. In a market economy the law 
of value plays a dominant role and all means of production 
circulate on the market and participate in competition. Hence 
the formation of the average rate of return. As organic capital 
formation increases, moreover, there is a tendency for the 
average rate of return to decline steadily, forcing enterprises 
to scramble for relative surplus value by working harder to 
improve production technology. At a time when international 
competition is getting ferocious, in particular, a number of 
illegal channels "leading to excessive profits" are often 
blocked, thus leaving S&amp;T competition the sole forum for 
legitimate competition. The enterprises' urgent demand for 
S&amp;T 
progress is precisely why the market economy can accelerate the 
transformation of S&amp;T achievements. 
  However, even in developed capitalist nations with a market 
economy, government spending on S&amp;T channeled through the 
planning mechanism almost equals what industry itself invests in 
S&amp;T. The reason is this. While S&amp;T typically wrestles 
with mid- 
and long-term economic development problems, market demand is 
basically short-term or near-term. Macro-planning by the state, 
therefore, is needed to compensate for this weakness. Thus, if 
we organically and flexibly deploy the two mechanisms--market 
and planning, S&amp;T will successfully drive economic growth in 
a 
sustained manner and an endless flow of S&amp;T achievements 
will be 
transformed into competitive new products. 
  S&amp;T planning under a planned economy differs from 
S&amp;T 
planning under a market economy. The former is technology-led, 
shaped mainly by what is in the plan and the technology 
development plan. The latter is market-driven, essentially a 
response to short-term and long-term market demand. S&amp;T 
achievements transformation is much more rapid under the latter. 
  -- Sluggish demand. Enterprises are the principal 
transformers of S&amp;T achievements, but their demand for 
S&amp;T is 
less than robust. The reasons are multifaceted. Based on the 
findings of surveys on some enterprises and scientific research 
institutions, they can be summarized as follows: 1) Since China 
is still in transition from a planned economy to a market 
economy, enterprises still have not realized their own 
decision-making authority. According to a survey on 6,800 large 
and mid-sized enterprises across the nation, only 15 percent 
have been truly vitalized. Government intervention remains 
excessive. 2) For the two-thirds of the nation's large- and 
medium-sized enterprises which are still losing money, these are 
tough times. They lack the economic means to go after S&amp;T 
progress. 3) Enterprise leaders do not have a strong awareness 
of science and technology. 4) Funds are lacking for transforming 
S&amp;T achievements. According to statistics, of the 
achievements 
already transformed, self-raised funds were used in 56.8 percent 
of the cases; government funds allocated under the S&amp;T plan, 
21.6 percent; loans, 5.2 percent; and venture capital, a mere 
2.3 percent. The transformation of S&amp;T achievements embraces 
the 
entire process from the laboratory to industrialized production, 
of which the most difficult stages are intermediate testing and 
industrialized trial production. They require investment on a 
large scale but is highly risky. 5) There are no common 
interests between enterprises and scientific research units. 
Enterprises complain that the units turn out immature 
achievements, poor in quality but high-priced. Scientific 
research units criticize enterprises for not understanding the 
value of technical commodities. The gap between enterprises and 
research units has never been properly bridged. Studies have 
been conducted on the standard of technology currently provided 
by research units in the country. Of the large enterprises 
surveyed, 77.4 percent considered it "average," 19.6 percent 
said it is "not high," and only 3 percent deemed it "fairly 
high." Even among small- and medium-sized enterprises, 59 
percent said it is "average" and 28 percent regarded it as "not 
high." In addition, 38 percent of large enterprises and 62 
percent of small- and medium-sized enterprises considered 
existing technology transfer costs "too high." In contrast, 90 
percent of scientific research thought they are "too low." 6) 
R&amp;D funds are not actually made available. Under State 
Council 
regulations, enterprises may set aside 1 percent of their sales 
revenue to fund R&amp;D. According to statistics, however, one 
third 
of enterprises set aside 1 percent while two-thirds fail to do 
so. According to surveys on the metallurgical, chemical, 
mechanical, and electronic industries, the set-aside rates are, 
respectively, 0.5 percent (1.5 percent), 1.1 percent (3.3 
percent), 1 percent (4.5 percent), and 5.5 percent (10 percent). 
(Figures in parentheses are averages of similar industries 
overseas) The spending gap between China and other countries is 
1:3 on the average. 7) Scientific research units balk at 
transferring their achievements and would rather commercialize 
them themselves. Statistics show that of all national-level 
major achievements, 34.5 percent were transferred and 
commercialized while 56.2 percent were commercialized by the 
research units themselves. The reason is that transfer fees were 
lower than R&amp;D costs in 50 percent of the projects 
transferred. 
With transfer, moreover, there is no guarantee that intellectual 
property rights would be protected. Of the projects surveyed, no 
protective measures were taken in 45.7 percent of the cases. 8) 
Enterprises have meager capacity for technology development. 
Statistically, 54 percent of large and mid-sized enterprises 
have their own technological development offices, but only 
one-third are really doing their job. Enterprises account for 
just 29.5 percent of all professional and technical personnel in 
the nation, only 24.6 percent of them senior personnel. 9) 
Enterprises prefer importing foreign technology and equipment to 
using domestic S&amp;T achievements. According to studies on the 
machinery and electronic industries, 39.8 percent of the new 
technology applied was imported while barely 2.8 percent was 
domestic in origin. Altogether China spent more than $100 
billion in the past decade importing technology and equipment, 
far higher than what the nation spent on R&amp;D at home. The 
reasons are manifold, eg., imported technology is mature, 
dependable, and of a higher standard, and can be swiftly put to 
work. Importing foreign technology also provides opportunities 
for overseas training. 
  As part of corporate restructuring in recent times, a new 
form of enterprise has emerged in the United States. For the 
specific purpose of developing a particular product, a number of 
companies and scientific research institutions may get together 
to form an "ad hoc" company. When the mission in question is 
accomplished, the company is disbanded. U.S. corporations too 
have been undergoing restructuring in recent years. They 
discover that the bigger a company, the more bureaucratic it 
becomes. This is the main organizational reason why the United 
States has lost out to Japan in international competition over 
the past few years. Japanese companies are structurally 
connected both horizontally and vertically. Big companies and 
big corporations are composed of small companies level upon 
level, with the small companies enjoying a substantial measure 
of independence. These days big U.S. corporations are scrambling 
to break up into smaller units to make themselves more flexible. 
It was against this backdrop that the idea of an "ad hoc" 
company was born.

  [Text] There are eight major problems in S&amp;T 
achievements 
transformation in China. 
  -- Under-investment. Not enough is being spent on S&amp;T 
achievements transformation relative to R&amp;D funding. The 
shortfall differs from industry to industry, but usually ranges 
from hundreds of percent to 1,000 percent. Without increasing 
investment, all the talk about accelerating S&amp;T achievements 
transformation will remain empty talk. The question is: Who will 
pay and how? How much money should be invested in a particular 
stage of the transformation process should depend on its 
riskiness and nature. S&amp;T achievements derive from R&amp;D. 
To 
ensure an unbroken flow of achievements, we must begin by 
boosting investment in R&amp;D. Although they are currently in 
the 
grip of an economic recession, developed nations around the 
world have been boosting their R&amp;D spending sharply relative 
to 
the GNP, almost reaching 3 percent. It may be that people who 
control the purse strings in those countries truly appreciate 
the importance of S&amp;T in the modern world. Moreover, the 
leaders 
of a number of NIC's and developing nations who have seen the 
light are also scrambling to increase S&amp;T investment. By the 
end 
of the century S&amp;T funding will reach 5 percent in South 
Korea 
and 2 percent in India, up from the current 0.9 percent. Other 
countries like Brazil, Egypt, and Thailand are also rushing to 
augment S&amp;T spending. 
  In China, R&amp;D spending accounted for 0.72 percent of 
the GNP 
in 1991 and dropped to 0.71 percent in 1992. The decline had 
something to do with the rapid expansion of the GNP in 1992, but 
it also shows that R&amp;D spending has failed to keep pace with 
GNP. If we persist in our present mentality and continue to 
force economic growth by desperately expanding the scale of 
operations and boosting sham GNP through waste, instead of 
relying on S&amp;T to bring about economic development, China 
will 
be overtaken by other developing nations, never mind catching up 
with the advanced nations. We must commit ourselves to 
increasing S&amp;D spending to 1.5 percent of the GNP by the end 
of 
the century, up from the current 0.71 percent. 
  Enterprises should increase investment in S&amp;T even as 
the 
government does likewise. 
  Venture capital should be used to finance the transformation 
of most S&amp;T achievements. According to estimates by venture 
capital companies overseas, in the 1970's it was possible to 
make a profit when one project out of ten survived and in the 
1980's, two out of 10. The transformation of high-tech 
achievements will not be a success unless we go all out to put 
the venture capital business on a sound footing. 
  There are over 600 venture capital investment companies in 
the United States with a combined capital exceeding $100 
billion. About 3,000 high-tech companies rely on these funds to 
finance their operations. For the most successful venture 
capital companies in the United States, the annual rate of 
return can run as high as 50 percent. More typically the rate of 
return is around 35 percent. 
  Intermediate testing, industrial testing, and production, 
all 
stages in the transformation of S&amp;T achievements, should 
mainly 
be financed by credit. State banks should set aside funds 
specifically to make S&amp;T loans. Between them, the Industrial 
and 
Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank made S&amp;T 
loans totalling 3.84 billion yuan during the Seventh Five-Year 
Plan and over 3 billion yuan in 1991 alone. But this is far from 
sufficient. By 1995 S&amp;T lending should exceed 10 billion 
yuan. 
Already S&amp;T lending in the Seventh Five-Year Plan has paid 
off. 
The 3.84 billion yuan in S&amp;T loans extended by the banks had 
financed 6,300 projects as of 1990, boosting output value by 15 
billion yuan and profits and taxes by 3.4 billion yuan and 
earning $850 million in foreign exchange. 
  -- Lack of personnel mobility. The most effective way to 
speed up S&amp;T achievements transformation is to enable such 
achievements to move with their vehicles--S&amp;T personnel. But 
since there are all sorts of barriers to the circulation of 
qualified personnel, the magnitude of such circulation is 
severely limited. Involved here is a host of issues tied up in 
social and economic reform: housing, health insurance, old age 
insurance, permanent residency registration, education for their 
children, and the job title system. It is proposed that the 
government speed up the reform of the social security system, 
particularly unemployment insurance, pension insurance, and 
health insurance. In addition, housing reform should be 
accelerated. When achievements circulate along with qualified 
personnel, disputes will occur over intellectual property 
rights. The state should draw up the appropriate policies, laws, 
and regulations to encourage circulation and protect 
intellectual property rights at the same time. 
  With qualified personnel immobile and small and mid-sized 
enterprises, particularly township and town enterprises, 
desperate for expertise, there has arisen the "second job" 
issue. Wages of S&amp;T personnel should be decontrolled and the 
government should collect taxes based on a progressive income 
tax system. The job titles of S&amp;T personnel may be divided 
into 
national-level and local-level ones. National-level job titles 
may be evaluated in accordance with national standards while 
local ones should be evaluated by the units themselves. To sum 
up, the government should introduce a "three-decontrol" policy 
with regard to S&amp;T institutions and S&amp;T personnel, namely 
decontrolling the hiring of personnel, decontrolling the 
distribution system, and decontrolling job titles. 
  In accordance with the principle of "stabilizing one end and 
deregulating one part," the management of S&amp;T institutions 
should vary depending on their type. There should be strong 
government support for institutions conducting basic research 
and public-interest research. Institutions and scholars who 
receive official aid should be evaluated every few years and 
measures taken depending on evaluation results. Open 
market-oriented research organizations should be left to the 
market; such organizations should be given decision-making 
authority in their operations and held accountable for their own 
profits and losses. 
  With the exception of scientific research institutions which 
handle state secrets and commercial secrets, other research 
institutions should be thrown open to society across the board. 
Controls on equipment, machinery, and personnel should be 
lifted. The fee-for-use and fee-for-service system may be 
adopted to accelerate S&amp;T achievements transformation. "Going 
outside" is not enough; we should also take pains to "invite 
them in." 
  Major scientific research institutions may consider 
vitalizing a section or office first by allowing it to join 
forces with one part of an enterprise to form a "flexible 
company." Once the task in question is completed, the company 
will be dissolved. 
  Decontrol S&amp;T personnel. Allow them to circulate freely 
in 
accordance with market supply and demand. The government should 
take pains to adopt a variety of incentives to encourage S&amp;T 
personnel. As far as the acceleration of S&amp;T achievements 
transformation is concerned, in the past most incentives were 
targeted at people in R&amp;D, while little was done to encourage 
people who had made outstanding contributions to design, 
intermediate testing, and production development. High-tech and 
new technology development zones have been instrumental in 
high-tech development. A number of special policies should be 
introduced on a trial basis in the high-tech development zones 
with hopes of accelerating high-tech commercialization, 
industrialization, and internationalization. To boost investment 
in high-tech, for instance, the Australian government has 
formulated a "150 percent tax rebate policy." Here in China, the 
government has adopted a "three-exemptions-and-two-cuts" policy 
in high-tech development zones. For people engaged in genuine 
R&amp;D, incentives should be made even more attractive in the 
future. This is because high-tech development is highly 
intellectual and highly risky and requires substantial inputs, 
so incentives should be augmented. 
  Let us take a look at the current state of China's high-tech 
development zones. The Zhongguan Cun development zone boasts the 
highest concentration rate of expertise in the world, yet other 
than the Stone Group, whose sales exceed 1 billion yuan, 
everybody else operates on a fairly modest scale. The biggest 
problem is that it is everybody for itself in the zone. There is 
no systems design, no coordination. Instead the companies are 
like stragglers and disbanded soldiers, each fighting its battle 
on its own. At best the zone can be described as a place where a 
number of high-tech companies are concentrated. It has not yet 
developed the collective edge of a high-tech development zone. 
  -- Importation mismanagement. When it comes to importing and 
transforming advanced foreign technology promptly, Japan must be 
the most successful in the world. In the 20 years between 1968 
and 1988, Japan spent $6.3 billion importing a total of 30,000 
pieces of technology. Had Japan tried to develop the technology 
itself, it would have cost them 14 times more in R&amp;D funding 
and 
taken four times as long. By importing the technology, Japan 
reaped $1,000 billion in direct profits. What a big pay-off! 
  There is no denying the contribution of technical imports to 
the sustained and rapid growth of the Chinese economy in the 13 
years since reform went under way and the open policy was 
introduced. According to 1990 statistics, China spent $100 
billion importing technology and equipment in the previous 10 
years, about $15 to $18 billion on the importing of technology 
alone. While no exact data exist on the direct benefits of such 
imports, the macroeconomic results have been quite good. 
However, the management of importation has many problems, which 
can be summarized as follows: 
  The phenomenon of "imports hurting domestic industries." 
There were many technologies and much equipment which China was 
able to provide. Still, vast sums were spent buying from 
overseas. Not only was precious foreign exchange wasted, but 
these imports also dealt a blow to domestic industries and 
S&amp;T 
work. 
  "Duplicate importation." According to 1988 data, 113 color 
TV 
production lines were imported, as well as 33 low-quality 
micro-electronic parts production lines, 70 refrigerator 
production lines, and 15 copier production lines. In the case of 
color TV production lines, the rate of capacity utilization is 
less than 50 percent. 
  Little spent on absorption, assimilation, and innovation 
relative to the spending on importation. Japan spends between $5 
to $7 on absorption, assimilation, and innovation for every $1 
it spends on importing. China spends very little on the former. 
At one point in the past, China put together a "12 dragon" 
absorption and assimilation plan but implemented only part of it 
for lack of funding. Take, for instance, China's iron and steel 
enterprises. They have a $6 billion import budget but spend a 
mere 490,000 yuan on absorption and assimilation. 
  -- Incomplete laws and regulations. As noted above, the 
transformation of S&amp;T achievements has been badly hurt by 
disputes between enterprises and scientific research 
organizations over intellectual property rights. Successful 
technology transfer must take place within the appropriate legal 
framework. A legal framework is needed to give technology 
transfer a favorable environment. 
  It is suggested that the government accelerate S&amp;T 
law-making 
to protect intellectual property rights. This is a prerequisite 
for accelerating S&amp;T achievements transformation.

0342 4395), Wang Xuefei (3769 7185 7236), Xu Sihua (1776 1835 
5478), and Gu Xinhua (7357 2450 5478) from the Research Office 
of Jiangsu Provincial Committee: "Reflections on the Issue of 
Carrying Out the Rural Enterprise Stock System in Jiangsu"] 
  [Text] Recently, we conducted a systematic investigation 
on carrying out the stock system in the rural enterprises of 
Jiangsu Province. We visited the five cities of Suzhou, 
Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Yancheng, Xuzhou, and 10 counties and 
districts. According to relevant information, by the end of 
August 1993 Jiangsu had 8,801 township enterprises (bodies) 
under various stock systems (excluding Huaiyin City). Total 
capital stock was 7.569 billion yuan, of which 2.088 billion 
yuan was newly increased capital stock. Viewed from regional 
distribution, more than 60 percent of them were located in the 
three cities of Nantong, Yancheng, and Yangzhou. Viewed from the 
proportion of stock system enterprises in township enterprises, 
7.45 percent was the average figure for the whole province, and 
the above-mentioned three cities made up respectively 27.56 
percent, 12.98 percent, and 6.92 percent, whereas the three 
cities of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou only made up 1.74 percent, 
3.64 percent, and 5.59 percent. There are five types of stock 
systems now being carried out in various places: increase the 
number of shares, discount the number of existing shares, 
joining shares by legal persons, joint partnership shares, and 
collective shares by individuals. Most were transformed from 
original collective enterprises. Altogether, there were 5,676, 
accounting for 64.5 percent of the existing stock-sharing 
enterprises. Trends show that southern Jiangsu primarily focused 
on collective enterprises and northern Jiangsu mainly targeted 
individual and private economies to implement stock systems. We 
can see from the above data that Jiangsu had an uneven 
development in carrying out the township enterprise stock 
system. However, the general trend is that it is unfolding from 
pilot programs to large areas, and in some cities and counties 
the practice is gradually gaining momentum. 
<H5>  Evaluation of Carrying Out the Stock System at Present </H5>
  In general, in recent years various localities carried out 
the stock system by pilot programs, promoted it only after 
gaining experience, and development has been healthy. Practice 
shows that carrying out the township enterprise stock system is 
another great creation of the Chinese farmer. It is also another 
new breakthrough in continuing rural reform at present. Viewed 
from achievements made in various localities, the role of this 
move stands out in the following five areas: It is conducive to 
(1) clarifying the relationships of property rights in 
enterprises; (2) strengthening the sense of masters and risk on 
the part of the cadres and staff of enterprises; (3) increasing 
new channels for raising capital; (4) adjusting the 
organizational structure and product mix, and strengthening the 
competitiveness of enterprises; and (5) establishing and 
perfecting constraining mechanisms, and standardizing collective 
economic organizations of communities and the managerial 
behavior toward enterprises by the government. 
  At present, current problems in carrying out the stock 
system are mainly: One, some cadres and masses have so far not 
unified their thinking. They still have quite a few "mistakes" 
and doubts in understanding. Second, some localities over 
emphasized the fund-raising function of stocks and neglected the 
transformation of management mechanism of enterprises. Thus, the 
stock system became a mere formality. Three, there was a lack of 
standardization in demarcating property rights and establishing 
stock rights. Particularly, controversy grew intense and 
practices varied over two issues, namely, the establishment of 
enterprise stocks and the change of collective stocks to 
individuals. Four, the proportion of individual stock 
partnership was low, only about 10 to 15 percent throughout most 
parts of the province. In practice, it is difficult to increase 
the staff's concern over the performance of enterprise 
management by this proportion. It is also very difficult to 
bring into play the superiority of the stock system. Five, 
relevant policies do not match. Particularly, the nature of 
enterprises under stock systems, registration, and credit 
policies are not clear yet. This has affected the enthusiasm and 
initiative of enterprises. 
<H5>  The Issue of Linking the Stock System to the Contract </H5>
Management Responsibility System 
  Some comrades believe that practicing the stock system 
means the replacement of the contract management responsibility 
system. This is a misunderstanding. There is no exclusionary 
relationship between the stock system and the contract 
management responsibility system. What the stock system solves 
is the property rights of enterprises, that is, the ownership of 
assets. What the contract management responsibility system 
solves is the management mechanism of enterprises. Some people 
simply put this kind of relationship into "property rights are 
shared in the form of stocks and management is revealed in 
contracts." This statement is reasonable. For township 
enterprises to establish modern enterprise systems, there should 
be a good combination of the stock system and the contract 
management responsibility system. Mutually complementary, these 
two systems will bring their roles into full play. 
  In terms of linking the stock system to the contract 
management responsibility system, Zhenjiang's experience is 
worth noting. Their practice is "two changes and two 
nonchanges." That is, "the form of distribution changes but 
contractors normally do not change; plans for management and 
development change in accordance with actual circumstances, but 
the contract quota system normally does not change." "Stocks" 
and "contracting" will combine to achieve a stable link. Board 
of directors, board of supervisors, and stock holders meetings 
must actually exercise their functions and powers. Township 
governments must reduce their administrative interference in 
enterprises. The form of entrusting stock holder representation 
can be employed to ensure the appreciation of collective assets 
of enterprises under the stock system. Experiences of grassroots 
organizations show that the relationship between township 
governments and enterprises practicing stock systems should 
include four areas: planning, coordination, supervision, and 
service. At the same time, attention should be paid to training 
a contingent of township entrepreneurs who have vision, clear 
thoughts, know how to manage businesses, and are knowledgeable 
of modern commodity economy. Only by so doing can we truly 
establish a highly efficient enterprise management mechanism in 
which property rights are clear, two powers are separated, and 
shareholders participate in democratic management and democratic 
supervision. 
<H5>  The Issue of the Distribution of Benefits </H5>
  The distribution of benefits is a critical link in 
carrying out the stock system. Whether this can be handled well 
has an important impact on mobilizing the enthusiasm of the 
collective, enterprises, and individuals so as to let the stock 
systems develop in a healthy way. Two principles should be 
adhered to in distributing benefits: One is the principle of 
rational accumulation to accumulate reserve strength for the 
development of enterprises. Earnings resulting from tax 
reduction or remittance on other preferential policies can be 
retained in enterprises as "state support funds" to be used for 
developing production, but not for profit distribution. These 
funds belong to all stockholders. Two is the combination of the 
principle of distribution according to work and distributing 
profits according to stock shares. In terms of distribution 
according to work, enterprises can determine the form of 
distribution within the scope of ratified wages. In the 
implementation of distributing profits according to stock 
shares, the principles that should be carried out are 
"effectiveness determines distribution," and "hand in first, put 
aside reserves, and then distribute." After taxes are turned in, 
the accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and bonus funds 
can be withdrawn. Then, profit funds can be withdrawn. In 
principle, profit distribution has no maximum or minimum 
limitations. What is actually implemented is that both benefits 
and risks are shared. In enterprises under the stock system, in 
practice profit distribution after taxes are turned in is done 
in various localities by adopting "50-50 distribution." That is, 
50 percent will serve as enterprise development funds, and the 
other 50 percent as profits and staff welfare funds and bonus 
funds. Within a certain period of time, the distribution of the 
"50-50" proportion is feasible, provided that enterprises have 
retained adequate production development funds. This form of 
distribution is conducive to gradually training stockholders in 
a sense of risk and reducing difficulties in setting up the 
stock system. 
  In various localities the distribution of benefits from 
individual shares takes three forms, namely, drawing extra 
dividends while retaining interest, drawing extra dividends 
while taking interest, and drawing extra dividends while 
excluding interest. For the stock system to become standardized 
as much as possible, the practice of drawing extra dividends 
while taking interest should be gradually transferred to drawing 
extra dividends while excluding interest. Drawing extra 
dividends while retaining interest should not be advocated. 
Stock system enterprises that have implemented the practice of 
drawing extra dividends while retaining interest should change 
within one or two years (normally the limit is within one cycle 
of profits distribution) into drawing extra dividends while 
excluding interest. Only drawing extra dividends while excluding 
interest can actually strengthen the staff's sense of risk, 
enhance the staff's concern over the business performance of 
enterprises, and thus form a management mechanism of sharing 
both benefits and risks. 
  In the perfection of a stimulus mechanism for benefit 
distribution, we can imagine some measures as follows: 
  1. Increase the volume of individual shares. Enterprises 
that 
have conditions can gradually increase the proportion of 
individual shares in the total capital of enterprises as much as 
30 percent, or greater. At the same time, they should encourage 
management decision makers to invest more shares, invest large 
shares, and gradually form enterprise stock controlling circles. 
  2. To mobilize enthusiasm of the staff, 10 percent to 20 
percent of the collective stocks can be taken out as the basis 
for drawing extra dividends but the ownership will not be 
transferred. A change of such a share should be accompanied by 
one or two cash matching shares from the staff. 
  3. After implementing the stock system, profits that were 
originally turned in to the township after taxes can be 
substituted by drawing extra dividends according to shares. Any 
dividends above 20 percent can be retained in enterprises for 
the expansion of collective shares. 
<H5>  The Issue of Matching Policies </H5>
  Many policy issues are involved in the system change of 
stocks. Viewed from general areas, attention should be given to 
work in four areas. One, the departments concerned in the 
province should work out relevant policies and regulations as 
soon as possible. Two, establish and perfect rural cooperative 
economic organizations to exercise the management function of 
collective assets. Three, establish rural cooperative economic 
accounting offices and auditing offices as soon as possible. 
Four, establish share rights circulation service organizations, 
and guide the rational flow of property rights in stock system 
enterprises within a certain scope. We suggest that policies in 
the following areas be clarified in the near future: 
  1. The nature of enterprises should be clarified. Various 
types of enterprises under the stock system should normally be 
treated as a new type socialist economic nature and supported 
vigorously. 
  2. When business changes and registrations take place, we 
should follow the principle of "seeking truth from facts, and 
simplifying formalities." Business administration departments 
should examine and approve based on enterprise charters and have 
them registered as their first priority. When old enterprises 
transform their systems, fees should be charged only as 
registration change. 
  3. In the areas of credit, township enterprises that had 
stock system changes should still be treated as the nature of 
their original enterprise. Appropriate support should be given 
to stock system enterprises with individual stock pooling. 
Individually pooled shares, which are also an important aspect 
of consumption funds being changed into production development 
funds, should be encouraged.

of Posts and Telecommunications' Ideas on Better Improving 
Telecommunications Service Market Management (3 August 1993) 
  The State Council has approved the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications' [MPT] "Ideas on Better Improving 
Telecommunications Service Market Management," and is now 
transmitting them to you, asking that they be implemented 
conscientiously. 
<H5>  Ideas on Better Improving Telecommunications Service Market </H5>
Management 
  To adapt to the needs of reform, opening, and socialist 
modernization, by better conforming to and serving our economic 
development focus, the posts and telecommunications sector, 
while striving to build a uniform, complete, and advanced 
national communications network, needs to fully tap all specific 
communications network potentials, by arousing the initiative of 
all parties, to speed up communications industry development. 
  In recent years, China has opened up to the public some 
telecommunications service operations. The telecommunications 
services that are now open to public operation are: wireless 
call-finder services; 800 MHz (megahertz) colony phone services; 
450 MHz (megahertz) wireless mobile communications services; 
domestic VSAT (very small antenna terminal) communications 
services; telephone information service business; computer 
information service business; electronic mailbox services; 
electronic data exchange services; video chart and document 
services; other telecommunications services approved or 
permitted by the State Council or MPT. 
  To preserve normal communications order, ensure state and 
user communications safety and communications service quality, 
and create a climate of fair competition, we need to improve our 
management of telecommunications service markets that have been 
opened to operation. So we are setting forth the following ideas: 
  1. For open-operating [deregulated-operation] 
telecommunications services, we should practice declaration and 
operating license systems. For all operations at the 
provincial, autonomous regional, or municipal level, local posts 
and telecommunications management departments should take 
declarations, be responsible for examining, approving, and 
issuing operating licenses, and report to MPT for the record. 
For trans-provincial (-autonomous regional, -municipal) 
operations, MPT should take declarations, and be responsible for 
examining, approving, and issuing operating licenses [permits]. 
Without examination and approval, no unit or individual should 
be allowed to operate the abovementioned telecommunications 
services without authorization. As to specific application 
regulations for declaration and operating permit systems, MPT 
will draw up and publish them according to the abovementioned 
ideas. Units already operating the abovementioned 
telecommunications services should make up the pertinent 
formalities per provision. 
  2. Units applying to operate wireless communications 
services must apply for operating permits to the MPT or their 
local posts and telecommunications management departments 
according to the stipulated examination and approval 
jurisdiction, and can operate only after obtaining operating 
frequencies approved by the wireless management sector based on 
operating permits. 
  3. Departments and individuals that obtain approval to 
operate the abovementioned telecommunications services may not 
set up regional barriers, and must observe the pertinent 
national communications policies, laws, and regulations, submit 
to trade management, oversight, and inspection by the 
responsible state communications department, guarantee 
telecommunications service quality, strictly execute state 
expense policy and pertinent fee-collection [charge] standards, 
pay taxes according to law, and protect the legitimate rights 
and interests of users. Service operations may not obstruct 
the normal operation of the national public telecommunications 
network or communications development, or impede the regular 
operations of other specific communications networks. 
  4. The responsible state communications departments must 
create a climate of fair competition for posts and 
telecommunications enterprises and other enterprises that 
operate communications services. Posts and telecommunictions 
enterprises at all levels should act according to the principles 
of compensated use and reciprocity and the state of supply and 
demand, and cooperate with each other. Units approved by the 
responsible state communications departments and holding 
telecommunications service operating permits must provide items, 
such as the basic relay equipment and lines necessary for 
service, to ensure that they provide good telecommunications 
service to the public. 
  5. Foreign firms may not operate or participate in the 
operation of communications services in China. No cable or 
wireless communications services of the public and specific 
communications networks in China may by operated or participated 
in by any outside group, enterprise or individual, or by the 
wholly foreign-owned enterprises or Sino-foreign joint or 
contractual joint ventures already in operation in China, nor 
may they attract foreign investment in any form for shareholding 
operation. 
  6. MPT and all provincial, autonomous regional, and 
municipal 
posts and telecommunications management departments must oversee 
and inspect the execution of the abovementioned provisions. 
Posts and telecommunications enterprises and other units 
operating telecommunications services that violate the 
abovementioned provisions will be respectively warned, 
criticized by circular, given deadlines by which to put things 
right, ordered to stop operating, have their illegal operating 
income confiscated, and be subjected to administrative fines, 
all the way to penalties, such as revocation of operating 
permits. Posts and telecommunications departments at all levels 
are absolutely forbidden to exploit license-issuance 
opportunities for personal gain, or to secure advantages through 
pull or influence, and once discovered doing so will be punished 
severely.

<H5>  MPT on Conscientiously Implementing the "State Council </H5>
Circular Approving the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' 
Ideas on Better Improving Telecommunications Service Market 
Management" (2 September 1993) 
  State Document #55 (1993), the "State Council Circular 
Approving the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' Ideas on 
Better Improving Telecommunications Service Market Management," 
is a key step taken by the state to invigorate the 
telecommunications service market, arouse the initiative of all 
parties, and speed up communications industry development, being 
a legal document to better improve telecommunications service 
market management, preserve normal communications order, ensure 
communications quality, and protect the interests of the state 
and the large numbers of users. MPT has acted in line with 
this State Council circular, by drawing up the "Interim 
Regulations on Examination and Approval Management of 
Deregulated-Operation Telecommunications Services" 
(abbreviated hereafter as "Management Regulations"), which will 
be issued and put into effect. In order to better implement 
the State Council circular and MPT's management regulations, we 
are specially setting forth the following requirements: 
  1. All posts and telecommunications management departments 
will organize their concerned cadres to conscientiously study 
and master the spirit of these documents, ensuring that 
cadres' ideological understanding and views conform to the 
spirit of these documents. To ensure the smooth progress of 
the tasks of examination and approval, making up and undergoing 
operating-permit formalities, and taking declarations, all posts 
and telecommunications management departments will apropriately 
replenish their trade management staffs and, after receiving 
MPT's management regulations, will investigate, study, and 
present specific ideas on implementing these documents, promptly 
reporting them to provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal 
people's governments. We will publish in the press the State 
Council circular and MPT's management regulations, as well as 
publishing an announcement clarifying the pertinent policies, 
and publicizing the names, contacts, and contact phone numbers 
of the posts and telecommunications management departments 
handling these tasks, for the convenience of units applying or 
undergoing make-up formalities for operating telecommunications 
services. 
  2. All posts and telecommunications management departments 
will provide stronger leadership to communications enterprises 
at all levels and ideological indoctrination to the concerned 
employees, to create good public terms for fair competition by 
the clearly deregulated-operation telecommunications services. 
  Communications enterprises will do all they can to promptly 
provide the relay lines needed to start service to units that 
have received permission to operate telecommunications services, 
and are prohibited from setting up obstacles or creating 
difficulties on any grounds, or engaging in unhealthy tendencies 
in any form. 
  All posts and telecommunications management departments will 
certainly stand with the state, conscientiously performing 
examination and approval management for deregulated-operation 
telecommunications services. Examination and approval 
employees will act impartially, being absolutely forbidden to 
abuse their authority for private gain or secure advantage 
through pull or influence. They will publicize oversight phone 
numbers, conscientiously subjecting themselves to public 
oversight. 
  3. As the policy on examination and approval management of 
deregulated-operation telecommunications services is very 
strong, all posts and telecommunications management departments 
will strictly enforce MPT provisions and, in coordination with 
actual local realities, conscientiously perform their trade 
management functions, by carrying out their examination and 
approval management justly and rationally. Pertinent policies 
and actual problems encountered in this work will be promptly 
reported to MPT. 
<H5>  MPT Circular on Taking Applications and Make-Up Applications </H5>
for Deregulated-Operation Telecommunications Services (11 
October 1993) 
  As required by State Council circular, MPT published on 11 
September 1993 the "Interim Regulations on Examination and 
Approval Management for Deregulated-Operation Telecommunications 
Services" (abbreviated hereafter as "Examination and Approval 
Management Regulations"), deciding to begin taking applications 
for deregulated-operation telecommunications services on 1 
November 1993. Units already providing deregulated-operation 
telecommunications services must act in line with the provisions 
of the "Examination and Approval Management Regulations," by 
making up the operating-permit or declaration formalities before 
31 December 1993; those that pass the deadline for making up 
formalities or are determined through examination to be 
unqualified to operate may not continue to operate, and will be 
penalized according to the pertinent provisions in the 
"Examination and Approval Management Regulations." 
  All applications for deregulated-operation 
telecommunications 
services on the provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal 
level will be subject to examination and approval by the posts 
and telecommunications management departments in the 
provinces (autonomus regions, municipalities) in which they are 
located; applications for trans-provincial, -autonomous 
regional, and -municipal deregulated-operation 
telecommunications services will be subject to MPT examination 
and approval. 
<H5>  MPT and State Administration for Industry and Commerce </H5>
Circular on Pertinent Examination and Approval Management Issues 
for Deregulated-Operation Telecommunications Services (14 
October 1993) 
  To implement the "State Council Circular Approving the 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' Ideas on Better 
Improving Telecommunications Service Market Management" 
(National Document #55 [1993]), by preserving a normal 
communications order and meeting public communications needs, we 
are here presenting a circular on pertinent issues involved in 
the management of examination and approval of 
deregulated-operation telecommunications services: 
  1. Units applying to operate wireless call-finders, 800 MHz 
colony phones, 450 MHz wireless mobile communications, domestic 
VSAT (very small antenna terminal) communications, telephone 
information services, computer information services, electronic 
mailboxes, electronic data exchanges, video charts and 
documents, and other telecommunications services approved by MPT 
for deregulated operation, should act in accordance with the 
provisions of State Council National Document #55 (1993) and 
MPT's "Interim Regulations on Examination and Approval 
Management of Deregulated-Operation Telecommunications 
Services," by undergoing examination and approval by MPT or 
provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal posts and 
telecommunications departments (abbreviated hereafter as 
responsible communications departments) and then, holding 
approved documents or issued operating permits, act in 
accordance with the provisions of the "Management Regulations 
for Enterprise Corporate Registration," by undergoing 
registration formalities at the industrial and commercial 
administration sector, to obtain business licenses, only after 
which they can begin operations. Units that have not been 
examined and approved by responsible communications departments 
and have not obtained operating licenses, may not operate 
deregulated-operation telecommunications services. 
  2. Units that have obtained permission to provide 
deregulated-operation telecommunications services, when needing 
to change items provided in operating permits or wishing to 
terminate telecommunications service in advance, should go to 
their original permit-issuing responsible communications 
department to undergo alteration or cancellation formalities 
and, in accordance with the provisions in the "Management 
Regulations for Enterprise Corporate Registration," go to the 
pertinent industrial and commercial administration department to 
undergo registration alteration or cancellation formalities. 
  3. Units that have obtained permission to provide 
deregulated-operation telecommunications services, and which 
violate communications management laws and regulations, will be 
punished in accordance with the law by the responsible 
communications departments, with the pertinent industrial and 
commercial administration department being promptly notified. 
Units whose operating permits have been revoked or whose 
approval documents have been cancelled, should take such 
notification by responsible communications departments on their 
own initiative to industrial and commercial administration 
departments to undergo registration alteration or cancellation 
formalities; those that do not undergo registration alteration 
or cancellation formalities in accordance with the provisions of 
the "Management Regulations on Enterprise Corporate 
Registration" will be punished in accordance with law by the 
industrial and commercial administration sector. 
  4. Units providing deregulated-operation telecommunications 
services before State Council National Document #55 (1993) was 
issued, should make up operating-permit or 
declaration-approval formalities in accordance with MPT 
provisions; those found through examination to be in compliance 
with the provided terms will be issued operating permits or 
approval documents by responsible communications departments, 
which will be publicized; those found through examination to be 
out of compliance with provided terms may not continue to 
provide deregulated-operation telecommunications services, and 
will be punished by the industrial and commercial administration 
sector in accordance with the provisions of the "Management 
Regulations on Enterprise Corporate Registration"; posts and 
telecommunications enterprises, upon notification by reponsible 
communications departments, will stop providing them with 
relay equipment and lines needed for telecommunications service.

Import and Export Corporation: "Trends Of Sino-Japanese Trade 
and Investment"] 
  [Text] 1. Macro-Trends 
  1) The State of Sino-Japanese Trade 
  Sino-Japanese trade has been growing steadily in the last 
few 
years. In 1992, at a time when Japan was mired in recession, 
when its trade with the United States and Europe barely held 
steady in the first half of the year and its exports to South 
Korea actually fell, Sino-Japanese trade shot up to almost $30 
billion, after breaking the $20 billion barrier in 1991. 
According to a trade statistical bulletin issued by the Japanese 
Ministry of Finance, Sino-Japanese trade amounted to a historic 
high of $28,903,000,000 in 1992, a gain of 26.7 percent from 
1991. Specifically, Japan exported $11,957,000,000 worth of 
goods to China, up 39.2 percent compared to a year ago, and 
imported $16,946,000,000 worth of products from China, up 19.2 
percent, with Japan running a deficit of $4,989,000,000, off 
11.4 percent from the deficit of $5,627,000,000 in 1991. In the 
first half of 1993, China became Japan's second largest trading 
partner. 
  Sino-Japanese trade has continued its solid growth since the 
opening of 1993, totaling $7,628,000,000 in the first quarter, 
up 23.5 percent compared to the same period a year ago. Japanese 
exports to and imports from China amounted to $3,396,000,000 and 
$4,232,000,000, up 36 percent, up 36.3 percent and 14.9 percent, 
respectively, from the corresponding period a year ago, giving 
Japan a trade deficit of $836 million. If this trend holds up, 
Sino-Japanese trade may top $30 billion for all of 1993 and 
Japan's trade deficit will continue to narrow, possibly dipping 
below $3 billion for the entire year. Looking at the monthly 
data for the first quarter of 1993, Japan ran a deficit of $750 
million in January, $50 million in February, and $40 million in 
March, down 29.7 percent from the same period in 1992. If China 
continues to import steel and electrical machinery from Japan at 
the current rates, it may run up a trade deficit with Japan in 
some months but will still end the year with a small surplus. At 
a time when China's monetary policy is being tightened and 
structural adjustment is under way, in particular, the momentum 
in steel and electrical machinery importation by China may be 
stalled, making a trade deficit less likely. 
  2) Sino-Japanese Trade: Commodity Mix 
  Japan's imports from China in 1992 essentially consisted of 
the following: a) apparel, $4.85 billion, up 50.1 percent, 43.5 
percent of total Japanese apparel imports by value and over 60 
percent by volume; b) electronic products, $1.11 billion, up 
34.9 percent. The growth in sound equipment exports such as 
radios and recorders was particularly striking, up 65.8 percent 
compared to the preceding year; 3) miscellaneous exports, also 
up sharply. In such categories as footwear, toys, and furniture, 
China has replaced South Korea as the top supplier to Japan. It 
is now the largest exporter to Japan of a lengthening list of 
products, accounting for 44 percent and 64.8 percent of total 
Japanese toy and umbrella imports, respectively. d) grain, oil, 
and foodstuff, up 20.6 percent. e) mineral-type fuels, down 3.4 
percent from a year ago. Petroleum products imports plunged 37.5 
percent, crude oil imports rose 1.2 percent to reach 
$1,791,000,000, and coal imports climbed 4.9 percent to hit $296 
million. f) Raw materials imports fell 6.4 percent to $1.07 
billion. Timber was the only gainer , up 20.2 percent. Otherwise 
steel imports fell 40.1 percent; cotton, down 46.7 percent; raw 
silk, down 55.1 percent between January and November; and 
silico-manganese, down 2.81 percent also between January and 
November. Chinese manganese exports to Japan will be badly hurt 
because of a decision by the Japanese Government to impose an 
anti-dumping tax on such exports. 
  Japan's exports to China in 1992 consisted mainly of the 
following: a) Electronic exports rose 61.7 percent, 55.4 percent 
of total Japanese exports to China; b) transportation machinery, 
including automobiles, $1,163,000,000, up 111.7 percent from a 
year ago; c) steel, $1,474,000,000 in value, up 8 percent from a 
year ago, and 2.4 million tons in volume; d) textile products, 
$1,223,000,000, up 32 percent from 1991; e) plastics, up 17.4 
percent; paper and paper products, up 35.3 percent; and records 
and tapes, up 144.4 percent. 
  Judging from the state of Sino-Japanese trade, China has 
become a major market for Japanese exports. In 1992 Japanese 
exports to China amounted to $12.8 billion, 3.7 percent of total 
Japanese exports, making China Japan's seventh largest export 
market. Automobile and machinery exports practically doubled. 
Japanese imports from China continue to be dominated by grain, 
raw materials, coal, and petroleum, but machinery imports did 
show a gain. In the long haul, Japan would continue to see China 
as a market for its high-added-value products such as 
automobiles and electronic goods. 
  3) The Trends Of Japanese Investment in China 
  a) Pattern of Japanese overseas investment 
  Investment in China is a key component of direct overseas 
Japanese investment as a whole. The latter, in turn, is a 
product of the shift in Japan's trade orientation strategy 
prompted by trade conflicts between that country and the United 
States and Europe. 
  Since recording its first trade surplus with the United 
States in 1965, Japan has waged an unbroken stretch of trade 
wars with the latter in such areas as textile products, iron and 
steel, automobile, and semi-conductor chips. Since 1980, the 
United States has been running a trade deficit with Japan in the 
tens of billions of dollars each year, accounting for between 40 
and 60 percent of America's total foreign trade deficit, 
including a gap of $43.67 billion in 1992. Japan's trade surplus 
with West Europe zoomed past $20 billion barrier in 1987 and hit 
$31.1 billion in 1992, 60 percent of the foreign trade deficit 
of the European Community. Japan's overseas trade surplus rose 
20 percent in the first half of 1993 compared to the same period 
a year ago. For Japan, the direct consequence of a massive trade 
surplus is the appreciation of the yen against the dollar, which 
has made Japanese products less competitive on the international 
market, which, in turn, has forced the manufacturing industry at 
home to shift operations overseas in a big way in favor of local 
production. Japan's overseas investment totalled $170 billion 
between 1986 and 1990 and reached $35 billion in 1992 alone. The 
lion share of direct Japanese overseas investment has gone to 
the United States. The resurgence of the U.S. manufacturing 
industry, including its success on the automobile, 
semi-conductor, and computer markets, has squeezed the rate of 
return of Japanese corporations operating in that country to the 
depressed level of 1 percent. Since 1990, in fact, some 
companies have been losing money, causing Japanese investment in 
the United States to head downward steadily since 1989. In 
contrast, Japanese enterprises in East Asia have been chalking 
up margins of profit exceeding 5 percent. Japanese investment in 
East Asia has been on the rise since 1990. In East Asia as a 
whole, China has considerable appeal to Japan as a place to 
invest mainly because it enjoys relative political stability, 
its economic reform has brought it closer to the international 
market, and it boasts ample manpower and raw materials, low 
prices, and a vast domestic market. According to the latest 
statistics, Chinese wages are almost one-twentieth those in 
Japan. Of all Japanese enterprises in China, 70 percent are 
making a profit, in contrast to the low-profit operations of 
Japanese companies in West Europe and North America. This has 
persuaded Japanese business to increase investment in China. The 
Ricoh Corporation has decided to move the entire production of 
its standard copiers to China. The Sanyo Electrical Company is 
also considering shifting to China the production of television 
sets, air-conditioners, refrigerators, and video-cameras. As of 
late 1992, the Chinese Government had approved 3,694 investment 
projects from Japan, with a negotiated investment of $5.97 
billion, of which $3.88 billion were actually invested, 11.3 
percent of all foreign investment in China. As Sino-Japanese 
trade expands, Japan's investment in China will continue to grow 
substantially, as indicated by the following: 
  First, research on the Chinese market and economy is being 
taken seriously and the enthusiasm for investing in China is 
still going strong among large-, medium-sized, and small 
enterprises in Japan. There has been a marked increase in the 
number of large investment projects in China. Accordingly, 
economic and trade organizations along with banks and other 
institutions in Japan have all augmented their research offices 
and added staff to focus on changes in China's market and 
economy and the situation surrounding this huge potential 
consumer market. They regularly invite experts from the 
pertinent research organizations in China to visit Japan to 
brief them on China's economic reform and investment policy. A 
number of banks have also put together China tours for their 
customers so that they could get to understand China's 
investment climate, etc., on the spot. 
  Second, investment consulting organizations have been set up 
specifically targeting the market in China. The Babaiban Group 
of Japan, a successful investor in the circulation sector in 
China, recently created a "China commercial investment club" in 
Tokyo. According to the group president, the investment climate 
in China is very good at the moment. China needs Japan's 
technology, experiences, and fund, so now is a good time for 
Japan to open up a new market in China. Babaiban plans to open 
1,000 stores in China by the year 2010. As they see it, 
investing in the circulation business in China, where labor 
costs are low, requires little investment in terms of equipment. 
Even more important, China is a massive consumer market. 
  On the other hand, investing in China also presents some 
problems, notably the following: 
  First, Japanese investors have indicated that some large 
Japanese banks balk at making loans to small- and medium-sized 
companies which want to invest in China because it is too risky. 
This has dampened the interest of small- and medium-sized 
companies in investing in China. However, if the Bank of China 
would come forward to be the guarantor, the companies will find 
it easier to obtain credit. 
  Second, there are signs of growing friction between Japanese 
companies in China and the Chinese side over such issues as the 
legal person status, the retention of foreign exchange, and the 
examination of their financial and accounting systems. 
  Third, since 1992 there has been widespread concern among 
Japanese investors about the overheating of the Chinese economy 
which took place earlier and other problems like price increases 
and unstable exchange rates. Endless price increases and rising 
costs hurt the bottom line of joint ventures. 
  Fourth, the investment policy is too arbitrary and secretive 
and there is an excess of administrative intervention. 
  2) Changes in the structure of Japanese investment in China 
  Direct Japanese investment in Asia (including China) has 
changed in two remarkable ways since the latter half of 1980. 
First, within the manufacturing sector, investment in 
capital-intensive projects such as those in the electronic and 
automobile industries now accounts for a rising share of total 
investment. To encourage car-makers to invest in China, the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] in Japan 
plans to hold regular meetings with the Chinese Government and 
the enterprises, the focus being the automobile industry. 
According to MITI estimates, China's annual automobile demand 
will reach 3 to 5 million vehicles by the year 2000 (1.3 million 
in 1992), most of them being family sedans. Japanese carmakers 
will gradually shift their operations from Europe and United 
States to China. Currently an excessive portion of total 
investment goes to the non-manufacturing sector. In the future, 
the center of gravity would gradually be shifted to the 
manufacturing sector. Second, investment in the tertiary 
industry has been rising relative to all investment. Japanese 
investment in the tertiary industry is concentrated in banking, 
commerce, and the restaurant trade. The well-known Babaiban 
Group, for instance, expects to open close to 1,000 commercial 
outlets in China by the year 2000. 
  2. Some Ideas on Expanding Sino-Japanese Trade and 
Investment 
  1) On Expanding Sino-Japanese Trade 
  Despite the lingering recession in Japan and its diminished 
demand for imports, the appreciation of the yen and mounting 
pressure from the United States and Europe on Japan to open up 
its market bode well for boosting Chinese exports to Japan. 
Furthermore, the decision by Japan and the Coordinating 
Committee on Export Controls [COCOM] to lift the embargo on a 
growing number of products also makes it easier for China to 
import from Japan. 
  However, there is concern in Japan's business community that 
measures of macroeconomic regulation and control taken by China 
to put the brakes on its overheated economy would worsen the 
foreign trade environment and public psychology. To pave the way 
for the resumption of China's membership in GATT, the renminbi 
may yet be devalued again. As part of its market diversification 
strategy and in order to reduce trade conflicts with the United 
States and Europe, China will increase its imports from those 
countries and South Korea, a move that will inevitably affect 
the share of imports from Japan. 
  According to analyses, Chinese exports to Japan in 1993 will 
grow at the same rate as in 1992 while imports are not expected 
to increase as fast as in the preceding year. Sino-Japanese 
trade is projected to grow 20 percent or so in 1993, for a total 
value of $35 billion (Japanese customs figures). Specifically, 
Chinese exports to Japan will rise 15 percent to about $19.5 
billion; imports will go up about 30 percent to hit $15.5 
billion. With imports rising faster than exports, China's trade 
surplus with Japan will continue to shrink. Sino-Japanese trade 
is projected to break the $50 billion barrier by 1995, making 
China Japan's largest trading partner after the United States. 
  To develop Sino-Japanese trade, we need to examine a few 
issues. 
  a) Sino-Japanese trade and investment are an important part 
of economic and trade relations in Asia as a whole. A new 
international trading pattern is taking shape today, one 
characterized by growing economic regionalization. To turn its 
economy around and prompted by self-interests and strategic 
considerations, Japan is in the midst of refocusing its economic 
and trade strategy to East Asia. With its expanding economy and 
1.1 billion people, China naturally has become Japan's primary 
target. It is important for them to further long-term 
cooperation and enter into a lasting complementary economic 
relationship. After establishing diplomatic ties and laboring 
for over 20 years, China and Japan have built a friendly 
cooperative relationship of mutual trust and complementariness. 
This complementary relationship will assume more prominence and 
the potential for developing bilateral economic and trade 
cooperation is vast. 
  b) Trade disputes multiply and the anti-dumping issue must 
be 
faced up to. Nowadays protectionism is on the rise around the 
world. As Sino-Japanese trade grows rapidly, trade friction 
between the two countries may intensify. At a cabinet meeting on 
29 January 1993, the Japanese Government decided to slap an 
anti-dumping tax on manganese imports from China, the first time 
Japan conducted an anti-dumping investigation and imposed an 
anti-dumping tax on a foreign commodity invoking the terms of 
GATT as well as its domestic tariff law. This move was also 
unprecedented in the history of Sino-Japanese trade. Already 
both the Japanese public and the government are deeply concerned 
that Chinese textile imports are entering Japan excessively. The 
possibility of a second anti-dumping investigation into a 
Chinese product cannot be ruled out. We should give this matter 
our full attention and come up with a response. No time should 
be wasted in formulating all pertinent laws and regulations to 
meet the new challenge. In addition, China should consider 
acting correspondingly with regard to certain import commodities. 
  c) Enhance the competitiveness of export commodities and 
expand our share of the Japanese market. The Japanese market is 
ferociously competitive and highly demanding. Therefore it is 
imperative that we never stop researching and developing new 
commodities specifically with the changing characteristics of 
the Japanese market in mind. In particular we need to marry 
trade with science and technology to turn out more high added 
value products and make ourselves more competitive. In addition 
to ensuring the quality of Chinese products and broadening their 
variety and design, we need to stabilize the supply of 
merchandise long term and expand our exports to Japan. Recently 
many customers have complained that the quality of Chinese 
products has declined, deliveries are late, and export channels 
are disorderly. All of that should be taken seriously by the 
departments involved. 
  d) Use imports to increase exports. As the needs of economic 
construction at home grow steadily, China will import 
significantly more steel, machinery, and automobiles from Japan 
in the future. Steel imports, in particular, are slated to rise 
sharply. It has been calculated that China imported over 100 
million tons of steel from Japan, enough to build 20 Laihu 
bridges (at 600,000 tons per bridge), in the 20 years since the 
two countries normalized their relations. At a time when the 
Japanese economy is still in the doldrums and its currency is 
rising in value, hurting its exports, the role played by China's 
massive imports in economic growth in Japan is obvious. In 
accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit, 
therefore, China should continue to use imports to boost exports 
to Japan, including electronic casts, conventional machine 
tools, and coal. 
  e) Develop new commodities and cultivate the Japanese market 
without cessation. Japan ran up a whopping $100 billion strong 
surplus in its foreign trade account in 1992, to the intense 
chagrin of the United States and countries in Europe which have 
repeatedly pressured Japan to open up its domestic market, even 
threatening to involve anti-dump provisions against Japan and 
limit imports from Japan. Japan has no alternative but to open 
up parts of its market in stages. This provides a good 
opportunity for Chinese products to make their way into the 
Japanese market. China has already acquired a wealth of 
experience in attracting Japanese capital and technology, 
improving packaging and design, and producing popular and 
marketable products with a high added value. By spotting and 
responding to trends and characteristics in the Japanese market, 
we must be ready to adjust our export strategy anytime, for 
example, by noting which commodities are going upscale, how uses 
are being coordinated, and what designs are becoming 
fashionable, and how improving packaging. 
  2) On Attracting Japanese Investment in China 
  a) The energy sector may well become the largest recipient 
of 
Japanese capital, a conclusion drawn from changes in Japan's 
energy strategy. 
  In the wake of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and 
changes in the Middle East, the energy community in Japan has 
begun adjusting both the form and the strategy of its energy 
trade. Instead of importing energy from abroad, which 
essentially constitutes the current Japanese energy policy, 
Japan is shifting to the development of energy resources 
overseas. Japan's trade associations and oil companies have 
begun petroleum prospecting overseas actively. Oil companies 
also are getting heavily involved in the liquefied natural gas 
market. 
  "Self-financed oil field" is the term used by Japan to refer 
to an oil-field in which it has invested and whose crude oil 
output it shares with the oil-producing nation in accordance 
with a predetermined ratio. There is a fundamental difference 
between Japanese and American or European international oil 
capital: the Japanese petroleum community has no "self-financed 
oil fields" or crude oil. This is the weakness of Japan's 
corporations. After the first global energy crisis in 1973, 
Japanese oil companies and leading trade associations acted on 
the national policy of broadening the development of 
self-financed oil-fields and got together to set up a joint 
petroleum development corporation to begin oil prospecting 
activities in Abu Dhabi, Indonesia, and China. However, with 
U.S. and European companies already established there, the 
Japanese found themselves shut out of the most productive 
oil-fields. For the Japanese, this venture had very modest 
results. In the late 1980's, major Japanese trade associations 
abandoned investment-based oil trade, which is highly risky, one 
after another. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Japanese oil 
companies entered into direct trade with oil-producing nations 
and the trend gained momentum. Their role in energy trade 
weakened, the trade associations were forced to participate in 
the international energy market via the "self-financed 
oil-field" route. The appreciation of the yen and the explosion 
of fixed assets during the "bubble economy" days gave Japanese 
companies the financial wherewithal to invest in overseas oil 
prospecting and extraction. The end of the Cold War between East 
and West and the discovery of new oil-fields in countries like 
Vietnam and Yemen also opened the door for the resurgence of 
Japanese enterprises. Through a mix of competition and 
cooperation, Japanese trade associations and oil companies are 
in the process of putting together an integrated international 
oil capital system in the U.S. and European mode. 
  In developing overseas energy resources, the Japanese 
business community has not put all its eggs in the petroleum 
basket. As interest in environmental protection intensifies 
around the world, the demand for natural gas, which is far less 
polluting than oil, is rising by the day. Power companies in 
Japan have become more dependent on natural gas. In 1991, 28 
percent of the electricity generated in Japan was derived from 
petroleum, more than any other fuel. By the year 2000 the figure 
is expected to fall below 20 percent. In contrast, 25 percent of 
the power generated in the year 2000 will be derived from 
natural gas, up from 22 percent in 1991. For this reason 
Japanese enterprises have been rushing to invest in natural gas 
development even as they put money into oil prospecting and 
exploitation. This is the new characteristic of Japan's 
involvement in the development of overseas energy resources. 
China should diligently explore any opportunity to extract oil 
and natural gas in cooperation with Japan. 
  b) The commercial and circulation sector can attract 
Japanese 
capital in a big way. 
  Since the circulation sector is a high-profit sector, it 
must 
be opened up to an extent that is just right. Specifically the 
wholesale part of the sector cannot be opened while retail 
operations can be thoroughly deregulated. Take advantage of this 
opportunity to accelerate circulation reform as well. 
  c) The automobile industry may well become one of the 
industries attracting most Japanese capital. 
  No major Japanese auto maker thus far has set up a 
large-scale production base in China, where the automobile 
market is one of the sectors with the most potential. Investing 
in the Chinese car industry is the next big move in Japanese 
investment, whether by transferring a plant here from Europe or 
the United States, entering into a joint venture with China, or 
setting up a wholly Japanese-owned enterprise. The Toyota 
Corporation, for instance, plans to increase its assembling 
capacity in Asia, including China, from 350,000 to 1 million 
vehicles by the end of this century. 
  d) Most attractive to Japanese investors is the banking 
industry. But a lot will depend on the deepening of banking 
reform in China and how far China will go to open up banking to 
foreign banks.

"State Statistics Bureau Sampling Survey of 35 Large and 
Medium-Sized Cities Revealed: Actual Income of Urban Residents 
Has Increased by a Large Margin"] 
  [Text] According to a sampling survey of urban households 
in 35 large and medium-sized cities conducted by the State 
Statistics Bureau, the incomes and consumption expenditure of 
urban residents in 1993 has increased by a large margin. Both 
their actual incomes as well as the level of their consumption 
has risen, but regional differences in people's incomes have 
been very large, and the range of residents with reduced incomes 
has broadened. 
  Urban residents' living expenditure incomes have shown 
actual 
increases of 10 percent. According to statistics, urban 
households of 35 large and medium-sized cities had per capita an 
average of 3,227.6 yuan available for themselves, 31 percent 
more than in the preceding year. The per-capita living 
expenditure income was 2,998.3 yuan, 31.5 percent more than in 
the preceding year. Deducting the inflation factor for the said 
period, the actual increases would be 9.4 and 10 percent, 
respectively. Although the average per-capita increase of living 
expenditure incomes was 7.8 percentage points higher than in the 
preceding year, the actual increase was somewhat lower, if the 
inflation factor is taken into consideration. 
  There are very evident changes in the structure of 
residents' 
incomes. The main characteristics of such are: 
  1) Incomes from salaries and wages are still in dominant 
position. Per-capita income of urban residents from salaries and 
wages in 35 large and medium-sized cities in 1993 was 2,092.6 
yuan, 24.1 percent more than in the preceding year. In this 
increase, bonuses with allowances and subsidies had increased 41 
and 38 percent, respectively; they had been the main factors for 
increases in salaries and wages. The proportion of income from 
salaries and wages in the residents' living expenditure incomes 
had declined to 69.8 percent from the preceding year's 73.9 
percent, a decline of four percentage points. 
  2) Incomes other than from salaries and wages had steeply 
increased. Such other incomes that staff and workers received 
from their units had increased 40.8 percent, compared to the 
preceding year. Net incomes of self-employed workers had risen 
48 percent; other labor incomes of residents had increased 68 
percent. 
  3) Incomes of staff and workers in three kinds of 
foreign-funded enterprises and in other ownership systems had 
increased by a large margin; staff and workers had per capita an 
average of 88 percent more income available to themselves than 
in the preceding year. 
  Very large increases were registered in the three cities of 
Ningbo, Shanghai, and Beijing, showing up the existence of large 
regional disparities. According to statistics, increases of 
per-capita living expenditure incomes in the three cities of 
Ningbo, Shanghai, and Beijing had been 51.2, 42.8, and 39.4 
percent, respectively, compared to the preceding year. They are 
the highest among the 35 large and medium-sized cities surveyed. 
Of cities with 30 percent or higher increases in incomes there 
were also: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Haikou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, 
Jinan, Wuhan, Changsha, and Nanning. Per-capita living 
expenditure income of the residents of Shenzhen reached 7,070.5 
yuan, which places this city at the head of all the 35 large and 
medium-sized cities, with Guangzhou in second place with 4,984.4 
yuan average per-capita living expenditure income. Average 
per-capita living expenditure income in the eastern coastal 
cities was by 26.3 percent higher than the average for all the 
35 large and medium-sized cities; this ratio had further 
widened, as compared with the preceding year. 
  Consumption expenditure of the urban residents is 
continuously rising, while the consumption structure is 
essentially remaining stable. According to statistics, average 
per-capita consumption expenditure in the 35 large and 
medium-sized cities during 1993 was 2,746.3 yuan, 30.4 percent 
more than in the preceding year. Deducting the inflation factor, 
the actual increase was 9 percent. Conditions of the various 
expenditure items in this category were: 
  1) Consumption of foodstuffs increased steadily, but 
consumption volume of some declined. Average per-capita 
expenditure for foodstuffs was 1,397.4 yuan, 22.9 percent more 
than in the preceding year, but deducting the inflation factor, 
the actual level of consumption had risen only 3.1 percent. 
Expenditure for foodstuffs accounted for 50.9 percent of total 
expenditure, a decline of three percentage points, as compared 
with the preceding year. 
  2) Clothing expenditure had increased, and more of the 
higher 
quality clothing was bought. The residents' average per-capita 
expenditure for clothing was 376.2 yuan, and after deducting the 
inflation factor this was 19.1 percent more than in the 
preceding year. 
  3) Expenditure for household equipment and appliances, and 
expenditure for cultural and recreational purposes, showed a 
fairly strong rising trend. In the 35 large and medium-sized 
cities during 1993, the average per-capita expenditure by the 
citizens on such equipment, household goods, and services was 
240.2 yuan, an increase of 33 percent over that of the preceding 
year. The average per-capita expenditure for articles for 
cultural and recreational purposes was 244.7 yuan, an increase 
of 36.5 percent. Average per-capita increases were registered in 
the following durable consumer goods purchases: purchases of 
washing machines increased 36.5 percent; purchases of air 
conditioners increased 1.5 times over; purchases of composite 
audio sets [zu he yin xiang 4809 0678 7299 0742] increased 14.3 
percent; and purchases of color TV sets increased 1.3 percent. 
  Up to the end of 1993, among the possessions in every 100 
households in the 35 large and medium-sized cities were: 91.1 
sets of color TV sets, 82.4 electric refrigerators, 90.1 washing 
machines, 44 photo cameras, 8.5 sets of composite audio sets, 
25.6 tape recorders [lu fang xiang ji 6922 2397 4161 2623]. 
  4) Housing expenses had rapidly increased, while housing 
conditions had continuously improved. Since 1993, the nationwide 
housing reform had been forcefully pushed forward, and housing 
conditions for residents have gradually improved. According to 
statistics, per-capita expenditure for the purchase or 
construction of housing has increased 2.2-fold, compared to the 
preceding year. Per-capita expenditure on furniture and fittings 
of houses was 15.8 yuan, an increase of 287.3 percent over the 
preceding year. Because measures of the housing reform have 
gradually been implemented, housing expenditure of the residents 
has increased. Per-capita rent, with water, electricity, and 
fuel added, amounted to 148 yuan, an increase of 36.6 percent 
over the preceding year and accounting for 5.4 percent of the 
residents' consumption expenditure. 
  5) Individual expenditure for sundry commodities and 
services 
has increased at a large margin, and the quality of life has 
been improved. 
  Because the quality of life of urban residents has 
continuously been improved, expenditure used by the individual 
resident has continuously increased. Average per-capita 
individual expenditure in the 35 large and medium-sized cities 
in 1993 was [number indistinct] yuan, an increase of 30 percent 
over the preceding year. In this expenditure an average of 26 
percent more was spent on gold, silver, and other jewelry, and 
44 percent more on cosmetics. In Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, 
and Xiamen average individual expenditure was more than [number 
indistinct] yuan, which was the most among all the 35 cities 
surveyed. 
  Statistic data also reveal that the income levels of urban 
households have gone up. Considering the effects of commodity 
price inflation, unemployment, and population increases, actual 
incomes of some parts of the population have declined. The 
extent of declining incomes reached 30 percent, which is 5 
percentage points more than in the preceding year.

Population Studies Institute at Hebei Teachers College: "Issues 
Involved in the Eastward Movement of China's Population as Seen 
From Hebei Province's Population Migration"] 
  [Text] Around the time of the early 1980s, reports of the 
"white-collar" eastward movement from western China were 
beginning to be a common occurrence; since the mid-1980s, the 
surge of a great army of floating population into China's 
eastern coastal provinces and cities has grown into even more of 
a hot topic; a 1987 population sampling confirmed the existence 
of this general trend of eastward population movement; the 
"fourth census" showed that all of China's eastern coastal 
provinces and cities, except for Hebei Province, had 
experienced a net population inflow. In fact, Hebei was no 
exception. We are here discussing several issues involved in 
China's eastward population movement as seen from this "special 
case." 
<H5>  I. Hebei's Population Outflow and Western Population </H5>
Immigration 
  A 10 percent sampling from the "fourth census" showed that 
from mid-1985 to mid-1990, while Hebei's population movement was 
a net outflow, its permanent-residence-registration movement 
showed a net inflow, with the net outflow being caused by the 
inclusion of the large population that had moved out temporarily 
for more than one year. 
  1. As to the population movement into Hebei from mid-1985 to 
mid-1990, all mainland provinces and cities showed an 
immigration to Hebei of 469,140 people, of whom 190,850 were 
male and 278,290 were female, for a male-female ratio of 1:1.46. 
  A) As to place of origin, the numbers were greatest from 
Sichuan, which accounted for 15.03 percent of Hebei's immigrant 
population; Heilongjiang came next, accounting for 9.63 percent; 
then in descending order came Inner Mongolia, accounting for 
8.54 percent, Shanxi for 6.1 percent, Shandong for 5.4 percent, 
Henan for 5.38 percent, Guangxi for 4.8 percent, Liaoning for 
4.46 percent, Shaanxi for 4.15 percent, Beijing for 3.72 
percent, Jilin for 3.7 percent, Guizhou for 2.94 percent, Yunnan 
for 2.3 percent, and Xinjiang for 2.2 percent; the other 
provinces and cities accounted for less than 10,000 people each, 
with Hainan and Tibet accounting for the least, and Shanghai for 
only 1,160. These figures show that: 
  As to the population immigration into Hebei, the 
southwestern 
region, which historically had less population exchange with 
Hebei, accounted for the largest percentage. 
  The "three north" region, which historically had close 
population exchange with Hebei, came second. 
  The immigration from southeastern coastal provinces and 
cities was least. 
  B. As to sexual distinction, the sexual composition of the 
immigrant population to Hebei from all provinces and cities had 
clear regional features. The places with the highest female 
percentages were Guangxi, where females made up 94.33 percent, 
Guizhou at 90 percent, Sichuan at 87.64 percent, and Yunnan at 
87 percent, with secondarily Inner Mongolia at 60.73 percent, 
Shaanxi at 60.6 percent, Heilongjiang at 57.79 percent, Liaoning 
at 54.49 percent, and Jilin at 51.2 percent. As to other 
provinces and cities with immigration to Hebei of over 10,000, 
such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Henan, and Xinjiang, males 
ranked first in all cases. This shows that: 
  Of the immigrant population to Hebei from the southwest, 
females ranked exceptionally high, with the northeast coming in 
second. 
  All of the immigrant population to Hebei from its periphery 
and other economically developed regions was mostly male. 
  2. As to the population movement out of Hebei from mid-1985 
to mid-1990, the figure was 665,590, of which 431,460 was male 
and 234,130 was female, for a male-female ratio of 1:0.54. 
  A. As to emigration destination, the numbers were greatest 
to Beijing, which accounted for 33.73 percent of Hebei's 
emigrant population, with Tianjin second, accounting for 15.93 
percent; then in descending order came Shanxi for 7.65 percent, 
Inner Mongolia for 6.13 percent, Shandong for 4.62 percent, 
Henan for 4.35 percent, and Liaoning for 3.17 percent; then came 
Shanghai, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, 
Anhui, and Hubei, all accounting for 10,000-20,000 emigrants; 
all other provinces and regions accounted for less than 10,000; 
the lowest was Hainan, with only 570 emigrating to Hebei, and 
only 1,180 to Guizhou. This shows generally that: 
  Hebei's emigrant population was concentrated mostly in the 
two cities of Beijing and Tianjin, which together accounted for 
nearly 50 percent of Hebei's emigrant population; second came 
other peripheral provinces, making up nearly 26 percent. 
  Provinces and cities far from Hebei but economically 
developed also accounted for more of Hebei's emigrant population. 
  Hebei's emigrants to interior and economically backward 
regions were least. 
  B. As to sex composition, Hebei's emigrants to all 
provinces were mostly male. For instance, males accounted for 
68.35 percent of Hebei emigrants to Beijing, 50.5 percent to 
Tianjin, 65.74 percent to Shanxi, 63.6 percent to Inner 
Mongolia, 60.87 percent to Shandong, 64.71 percent to Henan, and 
64.19 percent to Liaoning; of Hebei emigrants to economically 
developed regions, such as Shanghai and Guangdong, males made up 
an even higher percentage. 
  3. From mid-1985 to mid-1990, Hebei had a net outflow of 
240,610 people, of whom 196,450 were male and 44,160 were 
female, for a male-female ration of 1: 0.18. 
  A. As to Hebei's net-inflow population distribution, of 
Mainland China's 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous 
regions, 11 had a net outflow to Hebei, in descending order 
being 53,920 from Sichuan, 30,440 from Heilongjiang, 12,600 from 
Guizhou, 8,500 from Yunnan, 8,470 from Jilin, 6,140 from 
Xinjiang, 5,080 from Gansu, 4,590 from Shaanxi, 4,100 from 
Zhejiang, 1,590 from Hunan, and 680 from Fujian. Of these, 
except for Zhejiang and Fujian that are coastal provinces, all 
of the rest are located in China's southwest, northwest, and 
northeast. 
  Except for these 11 provinces, municipalities, and 
autonomous 
regions, Hebei had a net outflow to all others. This included a 
net emigration to Beijing of 207,040; second to Tianjin of 
70,840; then came 5,500 to Liaoning, 5,390 to Shandong, 3,670 to 
Henan, and 760 to Inner Mongolia, all of which are perpherial 
provinces and regions to Hebei Province; in addition, Hebei had 
respective net outflows to Shanghai and Guangdong of 17,640 and 
9,510; Hebei's net outflow to other provinces and 
municipalities was very low. This shows that: 
  Hebei had a net population outflow to all peripherial 
provinces and municipalities, focused particularly on Beijing 
and Tianjin. 
  Economically developed regions, such as Shanghai and 
Guangdong, have begun to become the destinations for Hebei's net 
outflow population. 
  Hebei had a net inflow from all interior and economically 
backward regions. In short, the directions of net outflow and 
net inflow in Hebei are very clear. 
  B. As to the sexual composition of Hebei's net migrant 
population, the sexual flow had very prominent regional 
features: of the net outflow to Hebei from the 11 provinces, 
except for Fujian, all were mostly female; on the contrary, 
Hebei's net outflow was all mostly male. 
  To sum up Hebei's net migration, it can be said that: the 
border and interior population had a net inflow to Hebei, mostly 
female, while Hebei's mostly male population had a net outflow 
to perpherial provinces and municipalities and economically 
developed regions. 
  4. As to the net migration by permanent residence 
registration, as stated above, based on provincial public 
security bureau data on permanent residence registration 
movement from the founding of the PRC [1949] to 1990, while 
Hebei's population movement has fluctuated sharply, it has been 
a cumulative net inflow; in the 1980s, this net inflow grew, 
peaking at 258,700 people, second only to that of the First Five 
Year Plan; from 1985 through 1990, the net inflow was 322,100, 
averaging 53,700 a year. 
  As to population movement in the fourth census, including 
the 
two categories of officially transferred permanent residence 
registration and "temporary residence," while we are 
temporarily unable to differentiate the two precisely, we can do 
so roughly based on reason for moving: this is because the five 
categories of work transfer, assigned employment, resignation or 
retirement, moving as dependents, and moving for marriage 
generally all require official transfer of permanent residence 
registration, while all others do not; on this basis, from 
mid-1985 to mid-1990, Hebei had a net permanent residence 
registration inflow of 47,050 people, averaging less than 10,000 
a year; while these figures are much lower than public security 
ones, they still show that Hebei Province is the destination in 
the eastward movement of China's western population. So the 
fourth census conclusion that Hebei is a net outflow province 
was due to the inclusion of the "temporary residence" population 
that had moved out for more than one year. 
<H5>  II. A Discussion of Several Issues Involved in the </H5>
Eastward Population Movement 
  Summing up the above, we can say that in China's population 
exchange of the 1980s, Hebei on one hand received mostly female 
population emigration from the west and north, while on the 
other experiencing a large outflow of its own mostly male 
population to mainly Beijing and Tianjin. Such population 
change had many causes and impacts. We are discussing our views 
on just a few of the issues involved below. 
<H5>  1. The Basic Cause of the "Displacement" in Hebei of the </H5>
Eastward-Moving Population 
  The eastward movement of China's western population since 
the 
1980s is generally held to have two basic causes: a) The 
eastern region already had a higher level of economic and 
technological development than the western region, with reform 
and opening having widened this gap. b) In correspondence to the 
above-mentioned conditions, the western region has a larger 
surplus rural workforce and less conversion capability, so that 
commodity economy development has made an eastward population 
shift inevitable. 
  Macroeconomically, why has Hebei become merely a temporary 
"displacement" for the eastward-moving population? This is 
because while Hebei has rich and diversified natural resources, 
which are well disposed, giving it resource advantages and quite 
good development potential, its economic development level is 
still not high. Until the last few years of the 1980s, Hebei 
Province's key economic and technological indexes, in contrast 
to the national and three major regional ones of eastern, 
central, and western, such as per capita gross output value, per 
capita GVIAO [Gross Value of Industrial and Agricultural 
Output], per capita national income, and per capita consumption, 
were all about 15 percent below the national average, equal to 
the central region, but ranking ninth in gross output value 
among the 12 eastern coastal provinces, municipalities, and 
autonomous regions. In addition, as to capital construction 
investment, in contrast to peripheral provinces, municipalities, 
and autonomous regions where population was moving to more, 
Hebei was backward in both investment scale and investment 
growth rate. In all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous 
regions with which Hebei had a net outflow, capital construction 
investment was higher than in Hebei; on the contrary, provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions with lower capital 
construction investment had net population outflows to Hebei. In 
light of this, I would make the following two points: 
  1. Population movement and flow is due generally to 
imbalanced overall regional potential, causing population flow 
from lower-potential regions to higher-potential ones. Where 
economic and technological development levels are lower, regions 
with better dispositions of resources, higher resource 
potentials, and stronger resource potential attract population 
immigration, with Hebei being in this category. This is the 
major reason why, with a still low level of economic devlopment, 
Hebei is both a "spigot" and a "receptor" in population movement. 
  2. Capital construction investment has played a key role in 
population movement and mobility ever since the founding of the 
PRC. The northward and westward movement of China's population 
center after the founding of the PRC was consistent with our 
national capital construction investment priorities, just as 
today's eastward shift of population center is consistent with 
our current national capital construction investment 
orientation. So the facts prove that national capital 
construction investment orientation remains the key driving 
force in China's population movement and mobility. 
<H5>  2. The Final-Assembly "Destination" of the Eastward-Moving </H5>
Population 
  A conspicuous feature of Hebei's population movement is a 
net 
inflow on one hand, along with a net outflow on the other. 
Such population-movement change, in addition to the 
resource-environment factor, also involves an inevitable 
outward-mobility capability. The historical 
population-movement trend and the fourth census show that 
Beijing and Tianjin have always been the priority destinations 
of Hebei's outflow population. In a certain sense, if Hebei's 
resource advantages were not mutually complementary with Beijing 
and Tianjin's economic and cultural advantages, to form a 
comprehensive regional advantage, it would seem hard to imagine 
that Hebei could absorb such a large number of western 
population immigrants. But the west to east 
population-movement change has formed a process of western to 
Hebei to Beijing and Tianjin, with Hebei as in intermediate 
"displacement," and the final destination being Beijing and 
Tianjin. So from a macro perspective, the final-assembly 
destination of the eastward movement of the western population 
is Beijing and Tianjin. This view is supported by the 
following figures: a) In the four-plus decades since the 
founding of the PRC, Hebei has had a net immigration of about 2 
million. But projected from a typical survey of our 
population movement, about 1 million have moved from Hebei to 
Beijing and Tianjin during the same period. b) The fourth 
census shows that from mid-1985 to mid-1990, Hebei had a net 
inflow of over 190,000, along with a net outlfow to Beijing and 
Tianjin of more than 270,000. So it could be said that Hebei 
has guided over 80,000 western immigrants to Beijing and Tianjin. 
  In light of this, how can the populations of large cities, 
such as Beijing and Tianjin, not be uncontrollable? This is 
essentially a matter of not paying enough attention to 
controlling urban functions, as sound functions inevitably 
increase population. As to the laws of urban evolution, the lack 
of decentralized urban functions makes it hard to control 
population size. In addition, population control of large 
cities, such as Beijing and Tianjin, requires overall planning 
with the whole nation, particularly neighboring regions, as well 
as coordination measures, without which it would be hard for it 
to be effective. Furthermore, in light of China's large 
population and its uneven distribution, unless effective steps 
are taken to strictly control our urban population, the 
population-expansion consequences will be even more severe than 
otherwise. There are two figures here that are much deserving 
of mention: a) Sample surveys show that in the first 35 years 
after the founding of the PRC, about one-third of the net 
immigrant population to Beijing was from Hebei. b) The fourth 
census showed that from mid-1985 to mid-1990, about one-third of 
the net inflow to Beijing of approximately 600,000 was from 
Hebei. If this reflects a certain pattern, in which Hebei 
receives an unending stream of western population and Beijing 
and Tianjin a similar population inflow from Hebei, then it will 
be hard to prevent the expansion of the populations of Beijing 
and Tianjin. 
  While these superficial views are likely somewhat biased, it 
is hoped that they will arouse attention and thorough study.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhuo (3769 3820), the "Saisi" Institute for </F>
Economic and Social Development, Guangdong: "How To Resolve the 
Contradiction Between Rural Modernization and the System of 
Household Land Contracting--Nanhai County in Guangdong Province 
Establishes New System of Rural Land Proprietary Rights"] 
  [Text] New Contradiction Attacts Much Attention 
  On their intensified efforts at reform and opening to the 
outside world, some coastal regions of China are facing the 
following new situation in their pursuit of agricultural 
modernization: While they aim at the "four transformations" in 
agriculture--agricultural modernization, agricultural 
industrialization, urbanization of villages, integration of town 
and countryside--demand has arisen to effect an overall 
rearrangement, a more rational utilization, and unified planning 
with regard to all land. This, as a consequence, is conflicting 
with the output-related responsibility system. In a reform 
experiment in Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, it had become 
quite clear that a rational resolution of this new contradiction 
is only possible with a reform and remolding of the system of 
proprietary rights to land in the rural areas, comprising a 
shift from the land subcontracting system to a system of 
"investment responsibility" [tou bao]. In the new system of 
proprietary land rights at Nanhai's reform experiment the 
property right of land was split into land ownership and 
corporate proprietary right to land, and the ownership right 
would then be returned to the peasants, while the corporate 
proprietary land right would be held by an economic organization 
in a cooperative land-shareholding system, thus forming a 
double-tier structure of the proprietary rights to land, where 
the ownership of land is dispersed and is integrated with a 
socially more acceptable distribution of the land resource. This 
is not privatization of land, but a process of discarding the 
useless and maintaining the useful in the system of proprietary 
land rights of the traditional collective economy, with its too 
high a degree of public ownership. It is a newly structured 
system of land proprietary rights of the rural cooperative 
economy on a shareholding basis, marked by land being brought in 
as shares. 
  A Cooperative Land-Shareholding System 
  The reform and remolding of the proprietary rights in the 
rural areas thus consist in establishing a cooperative 
land-shareholding system. In concrete terms, it is the 
conversion of land into shares, the resulting entity then being 
quantified per person according to their ages and according to 
the quality of the land. In planning the conversion of land to 
shares, reference may be made to the land tax evaluation or to 
the pricing of land according to its operational returns. This 
cooperative land-shareholding system separates the value 
substance of land ownership from the use value substance of the 
corporate proprietary right of the enterprise. This kind of a 
separation can resolve the contradiction between the future 
reversion of land ownership to the peasants and the intended 
overall land arrangements, the more rational utilization of 
land, and unified planning with regard to land. It will 
accurately resolve the contradiction between the modernization 
of the rural areas--the division of all land, with 
administrative districts as units, into basic agricultural land 
preservation districts, industrial development districts, and 
commercial and residential districts--and the system of 
proprietary rights to land. At the same time, the system of 
dispersed land responsibilities will be transformed in a 
well-ordered manner into an "investment responsibility" system. 
Implementing the cooperative land-shareholding system is a 
second reform of breakthrough dimensions in the rural areas, as 
it replaces the proprietary system of land holdings in the 
traditional collective economy and follows on the output-related 
household responsibility system. The difference between the 
present reform breakthrough and the first breakthrough is that 
the first reform breakthrough only went as far as the 
output-related household responsibility system. Indicative of it 
was that its precondition was the preservation of the original 
proprietary system of land holdings in the traditional 
collective economy, as the proprietary right to land was divided 
into ownership and use right, and the land was then distributed 
by the land owner, the former collective-economy organization, 
equally according to the head-count of contracting peasants, 
while no fundamental reform was effected in the proprietary 
system of land holdings of the collective economy. Indicative of 
the present reform breakthrough in the rural areas, however, is 
the creation of a new proprietary system of land holdings, while 
preserving the useful and discarding the useless in the 
proprietary system of land holdings of the traditional 
collective economy. With the cooperative land-shareholding 
system as breakthrough point, the cooperative shareholding 
system is being promoted all over the rural area. An assessment 
is being made of the entire assets of the primary, secondary, 
and tertiary industries in the former collective economy, and 
total value of assets will be converted into shares, the shares 
then allocated to persons, and share certificates will be 
issued. It will be stipulated at the same time that no 
withdrawal of shares will be permitted, a fact that will help 
maintain stability in the operation of assets in the cooperative 
shareholding economy. Distribution of income in the cooperative 
shareholding economy shall be preceded by payment of taxes and 
deductions for public welfare funds and public accumulation 
funds, whereupon dividends shall be paid according to the number 
of shares held. This is a socialist cooperative 
land-shareholding system with Chinese characteristics. 
  Step By Step Implementation 
  The reform experiment at Nanhai has made it clear that the 
shift from the output-related household responsibility system to 
the land-holding target model of the cooperative 
land-shareholding system must be accomplished in two steps: The 
first step shall accomplish the transitional model of the 
proprietary land right, while the second step shall achieve the 
target model of proprietary land right. 
  It means that during the first step of Nanhai's cooperative 
land-shareholding system, there has to be set up first a 
transitional model of proprietary land right by "unremunerated 
allocation of shares, and by actual dividends paid on nominal 
shares." The term "nominal shares" is to signify that these 
"land-shares" cannot be passed on as inheritance, cannot be 
transferred or pawned. The term "actual dividends" comprises two 
meanings: one is that dividends are paid according to number of 
shares, and the other is that when aggregate dividends reach the 
value of the land-shares (in some places set at 14,000 yuan per 
mu, in other places at 20,000 yuan), the stockholders' rights 
automatically end, but not so the right to dividends, which are 
then joined to the basic share and continue. The unremunerated 
allocation of shares is conducted according to the ages of the 
peasants and according to the quality of the land. I inspected 
an economic cooperative operating on shareholding basis at 
Xianan, Pingzhou township, and saw that their statute 
prescribed: 1 share for every person below 16 years of age, 2 
shares for persons between 17 and 35, and 3 shares for every 
person of 35 and over. They had completely broken away from the 
proportions of land held under the former responsibility system, 
so there was no problem about contracted land use rights 
affecting the share holdings. As to communes holding different 
amounts of land, conversion of the value into shares was done 
according to the actual holdings of each commune, so there was 
no more any problem of egalitarianism and indiscriminate 
transfer of resources of the "communal production" mode. 
  The second step in implementing the cooperative 
land-shareholding system at Nanhai would then be the target 
model for proprietary land rights, namely "remunerated taking-up 
of shares and actual dividends paid on actual shares." The 
so-called "remunerated taking-up of shares" is the counterpart 
to the "unremunerated allocation of shares." The land use rights 
contracted for by the peasants was then actually already bought 
back by the enterprise entity of the cooperative economy, using 
the accumulated dividends. It was for this reason proclaimed 
that the shareholders' rights from the unremunerated allocation 
of shares had ended, and that the peasants thereafter were again 
allowed to buy back land ownership by way of remunerated 
taking-up of shares, making the peasants' land ownership their 
share contribution; this, then, is the "remunerated taking-up of 
shares." This procession from unremunerated allocation to 
payments of dividends according to number of shares, and again 
to remunerated taking-up of shares, amounts in actual fact to 
giving back the land ownership to the peasants without 
remuneration. This, then, is the essence of Nanhai's experiences 
with the cooperative land-shareholding system. Nanhai 
implemented the system in two steps. First, it gave the peasants 
land dividends to strengthen the peasants economically, enabling 
them to take up remunerated shares, and this remunerated 
taking-up of shares will also convey to the peasants the idea of 
truly possessing ownership of the land. The "actual shares" part 
in the mentioned "actual dividends paid on actual shares" is the 
counterpart to the "nominal shares" in the mentioned "actual 
dividends on nominal shares." While it was not permitted to 
transfer, pawn or inherit "nominal shares," the present "actual 
shares" can be transferred, pawned, or inherited, but withdrawal 
of shares is not permitted. However, two things must be watched 
out for when allowing the peasants "remunerated taking-up of 
shares," namely, one, in consideration of the particular 
character of the socialist cooperative economy, provisions must 
be made as to the proper qualification of persons taking up land 
shares, and, two, considering the fact that land is a means of 
production without reproductive ability, and considering also 
the particular character of the socialist cooperative economy, 
it must not be permitted that a small group of people become 
prominent by controlling large amounts of land shares; a ceiling 
must therefore be prescribed for the amount of remunerated 
shares that peasants may take up. 
  Will It Lead to Privatization of Land? 
  Nanhai's new rural land-holding system is a two-tiered 
structure of proprietary rights to land. At one level the land 
ownership is given to the peasants, and the peasants are owners 
of the land. At the other level, the peasants use the land as 
share contributions and thereby create the corporate proprietary 
rights of the cooperative enterprise operating on the 
shareholding system. The system of which they adopt useful 
elements and discard useless elements is the land-holding system 
of the traditional collective economy. The system that they 
newly create is the land-holding system of the cooperative 
economy. The objective is to use the land-holding system of the 
cooperative economy to replace the land-holding system of the 
traditional collective economy with its too large a degree of 
public ownership. There is essentially no question here of 
changing the collectivization of land into a privatization of 
land. 
  Looking at the target model of the rural land-holding 
system, 
we see that the next step in promoting a well-standardized 
cooperative land-shareholding system has, as its precondition, 
acknowledgment of land ownership by the peasants. Without this 
precondition, there can also not be any cooperative 
land-shareholding system. Whether we honestly acknowledge land 
ownership by the peasants or do so only hypocritically will 
determine whether the land property ownership of the peasants 
will indeed be respected and protected.

<F P=106> [Article by the Autonomous Region Party Committee's Policy </F>
Research Office: "What Are the Peasants Thinking? A Survey of 
Peasant Households in the Region"] 
  [Text] Recently, 275 cadres of Hedi county in the 
Autonomous Region fanned out into the rural areas to conduct a 
large-scale peasant households survey; they came to understand 
peasants desires and demands through direct investigation into 
the basic conditions in rural areas and face-to-face contacts 
and exchanges with both the rural grass-roots cadres and 
peasants themselves. 
<H5>  I. Reactions of Peasants </H5>
  A. The survey shows that 95.4 percent of the households 
considered the situation in rural area to be generally good, but 
60.5 percent were ambivalent; while pleased that conditions are 
generally good, the peasants were worried that there are still 
numerous problems of concern to them. The situation is generally 
good, they felt, because the policy on contract responsibility 
remains effective, that this good policy was not altered but has 
continued to be refined since coming into effect; that under 
market guidance, rural production and the rural economy are on 
track to stable development and the trend shows that grain 
production and income are on the increase; and that rural 
livelihood has improved markedly and the peasants are fully 
confident that they will become well-off. 
  With respect to problems in rural areas which have remained 
unsolved, however, the peasants expressed a great deal of 
concerns. 1) A majority of the households felt that agriculture 
is still in an unfavorable environment today, and some peasants 
compared the situation to two persistent sicknesses of "malaria" 
and "edema," [waxing and waning in enthusiasm for agriculture on 
one hand and an excessively bloated condition on the other] for 
although agriculture has long been considered to occupy an 
important position [in the economy], it is basically still weak. 
If the two "sicknesses" were not cured, it would be difficult 
for rural areas and the rural economy to advance to the next 
stage. 2) 87.4 percent were very much worried that policy 
measures designed to protect them and agriculture will continue, 
particularly measures to increase government input in 
agriculture, reduce the social burdens on peasants, control the 
unhealthy tendencies, and permit and encourage peasants to seek 
employment in secondary and tertiary industries in the cities. 
3) The peasants surveyed anxiously looked forward to seeing 
their agricultural production and enterprises get in the market 
channels as soon as possible and having their income increased, 
but the gap between their need and the actual situation remains 
considerable. The survey demonstrates that irrational structure 
in rural enterprises is the greatest inhibiting factor. In 1992, 
among model village households, the ratios of income derived 
from grain, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline products and 
fishery were 73:3:17:2:5; the ratios of income from growing 
grain versus cash and other crops were 79:13:8, and nonfarm 
income was 40 percent of total income. In 24.3 percent of model 
village households, the per capita income was as low as 300 
yuan. 4) The pressure of agricultural surplus labor in rural 
areas is increasingly severe. The annual labor transfer rate in 
model village households is only 0.8 percent, and one-third of 
the labor force is idle reflecting a trend of declining labor 
productivity; in over 70 percent of the households, real income 
is showing slow growth or negative growth. 
  B. On rural reforms and rural policies, the survey shows 
that 
the peasants placed their greatest hope in both these areas, and 
their major demand is that reforms should be pursued even more 
rigorously to achieve breakthroughs proceeding on a foundation 
of basic policy stability. 1) 77.3 percent of the households 
felt that the joint household contract responsibility system 
should remain unchanged over the long term; 48.5 percent felt 
that changes would not be necessary in contract land and that 
the system can operate satisfactorily by voluntary transfer [of 
contract land]. 2) 54.2 percent considered that application of 
reforms and other policy measures should differentiate among 
households and not treat all of them equally, for income 
discrepancy is normal and some people should be permitted to 
become well-off first; but 28.9 percent felt that from the start 
attention should be paid to preventing the gap between rich and 
poor from growing too wide, and achieving common prosperity 
through coordinated reform policy measures. 3) All 100 percent 
of the households felt that rural reforms and policies should 
focus on the crucial issues of assisting peasants achieve 
breakthroughs in a market economy within a broad framework, 
particularly in breaking down the duality which divides urban 
and rural areas, and adjusting the enterprise structure and 
social services system. 4) 49.3 percent felt that further 
efforts should be made to perfect policy and reform measures and 
to coordinate with other plans as important as those for a 
market economy. 
  In the survey, the peasants revealed four difficult issues 
in 
rural reform that must be addressed and resolved: First, the 
discrepancy between urban and rural reforms whereby many 
measures which benefit rural economic development and increase 
rural income cannot be implemented because of incompatibility 
with urban reforms. Second, with policies being formulated in 
different quarters, forceful coordination and supervision of 
policy implementation are lacking, and peasants themselves could 
hardly resolve policies which are contradictory; some good 
policies lack firmness and corollary measures to ensure their 
implementation; at present, insufficiently firm policies are a 
particularly notable problem. Third, the lack of clear-sighted 
policies which affect the crucial question of economic 
development today. Policies which peasants have anxiously 
awaited are still pending, creating numerous difficulties which 
peasants cannot solve in a timely way under condition of a 
market economy. Fourth, propaganda and education for peasants on 
reform policies are inadequate. Channels for peasants to learn 
about and understand these policies are limited, and feedback on 
peasants needs is not timely which affects the enthusiasm of 
peasants to participate in implementing the policies. 
  C. Views toward the rural areas and economy. On evaluating 
the enthusiasm for production, especially grain production, 
views of the peasants varied considerably. The survey indicates 
that 59.3 percent of the households considered there is a future 
if agriculture is handled well; 63.4 percent felt that to ensure 
adequate grain production, continued efforts are required; 60.2 
percent felt that with grain prices freed, and if grain can be 
sold under such conditions, they would be willing to increase 
input in agricultural production; and more than 90 percent felt 
that even if a large part of the labor force were diverted to 
various nonfarm pursuits and enterprises, contract land should 
not be abandoned. 
  The peasants surveyed also gave their reactions to the 
various factors which affect grain production enthusiasm under 
the present system. 1) 40.7 percent felt that if the relative 
benefits of agriculture were to continue to decline and the 
grain market remained in its slump, they would consider 
abandoning farming; 2) 56.4 percent felt that when more grain is 
grown than can be sold, "prices obviously would drop given the 
glut in supplies." Some considered that given the current 
situation of grain in surplus and money in short supply, it is 
more important to hang on to cash and wait to see if protective 
policy measures would have any effect in reviving prices; 3) 
16.2 percent felt that the current shortage of capital has 
resulted in insufficient agricultural input, and fragmentation 
of land use has affected raising of agricultural productivity. 
  On the various avenues for developing the rural economy, 
views of the rural cadres and peasants are: 1) Developing the 
rural economy should begin by developing various forms of 
enterprises. Household enterprises should be preserved and their 
enterprise structure adjusted according to market demands. 2) It 
is necessary to take advantage of any opportunity to adjust the 
enterprise structure, particularly by allowing different forms 
of ownership to freely evolve in rural enterprises. In 1992, the 
income peasants households derived from rural enterprises was 
only 18.8 percent of their total income, lower than the national 
average but with considerable growth potential. 3) The 
collective economy should be firmly supported. In 1992 the 
villages surveyed had fixed assets valued at 35,318,500 yuan, 
averaging 318,100 yuan per village, which constituted an 
important productive force in the rural areas. To develop the 
collective economy at the village level, it is necessary to 
perfect a dual-level operating system by vigorously developing 
basic infrastructure enterprises, rural enterprises and 
strengthened services for rural areas. 
  D. Views on development of the rural society. The survey 
shows the peasants to be eager for more rapid social development 
in the rural areas: 1) 85.7 percent felt that the pace of social 
development in rural areas should be stepped up; 90.5 percent 
would be willing to contribute some capital or labor toward 
building up and improving the rural areas and markets. 2) 82.6 
percent felt that small cities, townships and market towns 
should be built up. 3) 27.8 percent indicated they would 
consider settling in such small cities, townships and market 
towns. 
  In social development, which aspects should be emphasized in 
the near term? The peasants generally felt that building 
infrastructure facilities is important. 1) 51.6 percent felt 
that priority should be given to building up townships and 
villages to meet requirements of a developing market economy; 
25.1 percent felt that social development should benefit village 
residents and improve village appearance; 22.4 percent felt that 
the focus should be on unifying water supply system to solve 
problems of potable and clean water. 2) 41.9 percent expressed 
concern over their feeling of insecurity due to the poor public 
security in certain parts of the region where such cases are 
increasing in number; they therefore felt that safety and 
security of peasant households should be given priority in any 
social development. 3) 92.4 percent advocated vigorous promotion 
and building of spiritual culture. All the households without 
exception wanted the authorities to grasp the problems with both 
hands and resolutely carry out the basic tasks of improving the 
peasant society. 
  On promoting a spiritual culture, views of the peasants are: 
1) Propaganda on law and order is inadequate, building of a 
legal system has been lagging, and understanding of the concept 
of a legal system is weak. On law and order propaganda, 50.3 
percent said it has been sporadic; 18.9 percent said there has 
been no such propaganda. 2) The building of a spiritual culture 
is considered a soft task and this is reflected in work the 
government carries out in rural areas. 3) Many aspects of 
building a spiritual culture are divorced from the reality of 
peasants life, and activities which emphasize only form without 
firm substantive objectives have produced [unfavorable] side 
effects among the peasants. 4) Building a spiritual culture will 
naturally take a period of time and must take into account both 
[agricultural] production and the reality of peasants life. More 
than one-half of the households surveyed suggested that 
henceforth government work teams should be trained before they 
are sent to rural areas to carry out model propaganda education 
on a regular basis. 
  E. Views toward grass-roots level development. According to 
estimates by agricultural cadres, 82 percent of the households 
considered the behavior of grass-roots level cadres to be good 
or basically good; 85.6 percent felt that the cadre-peasant 
relationship is harmonious. The peasants also felt, however, 
that there are too many such cadres, that "many dragons are not 
necessarily needed to fight drought." In model villages, there 
is an average of 5.8 cadres per village. The peasants felt that 
the basis of their assignment should be sending small numbers of 
well-trained cadres, numbers which peasants can afford to 
support and which will also fully demonstrate the cadre 
enthusiasm and potentials. 
  Improving the grass-roots level cadres means first improving 
the party rank and file, that is the relatively uniform view of 
the peasants surveyed. The survey shows that 38.5 percent of the 
households felt that a majority of party rank and file are 
effective, but 18.9 percent do not have a very good basic 
impression of them in the rural areas. 
<H5>  II. Hopes, Opinions and Demands of Peasants </H5>
  The peasants surveyed expressed some of their hopes, 
opinions 
and demands which may be summed up in terms of the following: 
  1. The peasants hoped that leaders at every level will visit 
rural areas, and come to their villages and households for 
face-to-face conversations and draw out what is in their hearts. 
At present, the real situation in rural areas becomes diluted as 
it is reported upward level by level, and there is discrepancy 
between propaganda and reality, e.g. over the extent to which 
peasants are supposed to be well-off today. 
  2. They hoped that central and local governments will be 
resolute in applying real efforts to carry work in rural areas; 
if agriculture is considered the foundation of the national 
economy, then work in this area should be given that degree of 
emphasis; with agriculture the topic of meetings, slogans and 
government documents, the peasants anxiously hoped that this 
emphasis will lead quickly to many good policies which will 
benefit them when implemented. 
  3. The party holds peasants in high regard and gives them an 
important political status, the peasants surveyed were most 
grateful and pleased. But despite the high political status, 
peasants felt that if they were not able to catch up 
economically, their social status will not be any higher. Today 
the urban-rural gap is getting wider, and the peasants though 
anxious cannot do anything about this; they therefore hoped that 
their leaders will truly open up the gates to the cities, tear 
down the "bamboo wattled wall," give more thoughts to how to 
increase peasants income, narrow the [rural and urban] 
discrepancy in incomes, and draw closer together the hearts and 
minds of both rural and urban residents. 
  4. Stabilizing and perfecting basic policies for rural areas 
please all the peasants surveyed. While at this time it is 
correct to emphasize stabilization of the joint household 
responsibility system, it is not enough, for many other policies 
should also be stabilized. For example, some peasants were 
afraid that the policy allowing them to develop individual 
enterprises may change and therefore held back from trying. 
  5. They hoped that as in the 1950s and 1960s, the 
authorities 
will integrate and blend together support coming from all 
quarters for the rural areas, and assist peasants to develop the 
economy and increase their income. In such a context, any action 
which hurts, cheats, discriminates, oppresses or tries to 
shallow up the peasants will immediately evoke a reaction such 
as that of people crying out to kill a rat seen running across 
the street. 
  6. Rural education is a major task of concern to several 
generations of peasants, and education should be the first task 
in developing the rural areas. Today, the transition in 
agriculture is difficult for peasants to manage, but many do so 
in the interest of their next generations. To help the rural 
economy become prosperous, the peasants hoped the government 
will do its best in the task of education. 
  7. To improve public security in society, it is necessary to 
begin in rural areas; if it is not done well there, and rural 
areas are insecure, then this will affect the cities. A 
coordinated approach to improving public security requires that 
attention be given to both urban and rural areas. 
  8. In dealing with corruption, major cases must not be 
allowed to drag on, and issues of administrative corruption must 
first be dealt with. At present, action to redress unhealthy 
tendencies in the enterprises has not been adequate, and the 
peasants hoped that more effort will be made. The best approach 
would be to focus on the worst model and openly attack it within 
a broad framework. 
  9. More efforts should be made to train leadership cadres 
for 
rural areas. Selected for training should be persons of ability 
who think for themselves, who work with their hands and who rely 
on their labor and talent to produce wealth. 
<H5>  III. Issues That Require Effective Implementation </H5>
  Judging by the situation revealed in this large-scale 
households survey, and considering the coming period of 
intensified rural reforms and accelerated development of the 
rural economy, the following issues will require major 
implementation efforts from a macro standpoint: 
  1. Strengthen and nurture the basic rural enterprise units 
by 
stabilizing the overall situation in rural areas. Survey results 
demonstrate that in the Autonomous Region, the work in 
stabilizing and perfecting the household contract responsibility 
system in the context of a dual-level enterprise system has been 
effective and should continue. In perfecting both systems, 
reforms and policies should aim at solving new contradictions 
that emerge, particularly on the key issue that in rural 
economic development, rural households be made the basic 
enterprise units which need to accommodate demands of a 
developing market-based economy. To raise the level of household 
enterprises, we need to promote rural market development. At the 
same time, our policy should create advantageous conditions for 
building and perfecting socialized services for the rural areas. 
  2. Vigorously develop high-quality and high-efficiency 
agriculture and raise the benefit ratio of agriculture. To 
achieve this type of agriculture, it is necessary to put 
economic efficiency and market demands first as we change from 
concentrating on quantitative increase in production to 
emphasizing raising qualitative benefits. We should aim for 
major breakthroughs in reforms by vigorously adjusting the rural 
enterprise structure, establishing conditions favorable to 
market development of pillar enterprises within the Autonomous 
Region, accelerating development of enterprises with good 
benefits ratios, vigorously developing new enterprises, and 
promoting the unification of production and sales. We should aim 
to combine breakthroughs in key areas with growth in all areas, 
to establish agricultural model demonstration areas, and to 
intensify development of improved product variety, grade and 
quality. 
  3. Through breakthrough reform of the households 
registration 
system, accelerate unification of rural and urban areas. An 
important aspect of the deepening rural reforms is to break down 
the dual economic setup and system. We should first remove 
restrictions on rural households then encourage the peasants to 
take jobs in secondary and tertiary industries in cities, 
townships and market towns and, through the momentum and 
indirect effects of this trend, promote social development in 
rural areas and unification of rural and urban areas. 
  4. To put agriculture and the rural economy within the 
overall national economic strategy, support further multifaceted 
development. We should effectively implement the "agricultural 
law," guarantee that financial input in agriculture will 
increase by fixed percentages on a yearly basis, widen the scope 
of credit support for agricultural development and adjust the 
rural enterprise structure. We should support internal liquidity 
of agricultural cooperative funds. We should develop new 
approaches and measures to provide overall social support to 
agriculture and activities in rural areas, and develop various 
kinds of alliances and cooperations. 
  5. Based on demands created by the changing economic system, 
strengthen the building of a spiritual culture. To do so 
requires that we strengthen efforts to deal with the basic 
tasks, change our approach from focussing on form to 
concentrating on substance, and take into account peasants 
thinking and rural reality in developing effective activities. 
In the current period and foreseeable future, we need to 
administer the rural areas according to regulations and allow 
democratic management to come to the fore. 
  6. Earnestly strengthen the leadership for work in rural 
areas. First, we should quickly establish a consolidated 
leadership structure for work in rural areas under the direct 
supervision of the party and government, strengthen organization 
and coordination of any work with peasants, and carry out 
effective analysis and supervision of policy measures and 
macro-level guidance. Second, based on demands of the Central 
Government, built basic-level organizations in rural areas in 
stages within a three to five year period. We should concentrate 
on improving the party organization before any basic-level 
organizations in rural areas, educating party members before 
rural cadres, raising the quality of party rank and file before 
the peasants, and finally developing and shaping teams of party 
cadres who possess firm and forceful leadership and can take the 
lead [to energize the masses]. Third, change and improve on 
methods to evaluate performance of leadership by using peasants 
real income increase as criterion to judge effectiveness of the 
cadre teams and of the support given by leadership and 
government departments at every level for developing the rural 
economy and increasing peasants income.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 14 (XINHUA) -- Charities have staged 
a comeback in China after a lapse of two decades. 
  Recently, the official PEOPLE'S DAILY carried an article to 
say that charity is no longer a forbidden word, indicating an 
immediate development of charities in the country. 
  Shanghai, the country's biggest metropolis, established its 
charity foundation earlier this week, following the first 
non-governmental charity organization, which was set up in 
northeast China's Liaoning Province. 
  The focus of attention even in its preparatory period, the 
foundation received six million yuan in donations through 
various channels in a week prior to its founding. 
  Two brothers from east China's Anhui Province have 
contributed 3,700 yuan to the foundation, which they were 
awarded for responding courageously to save drowning people. 
  Charity campaigns have swung through the country since last 
year. 
  When a helping-the-orphans event was initiated in Hangzhou 
City in east China's Zhejiang Province, over 7,000 people swung 
into action, donating a million yuan and adopting more than 50 
homeless children. 
  In the capital Beijing, hospitals sponsored a "love and 
health" activity, giving free treatment and operations to 24 
orphans. 
  This year, Shanghai has launched several projects to extend 
a 
warm hand to the disabled, residents in poverty and homeless 
children. Now, there are about 32,000 such people under social 
care. 
  Many people consider charities to be noble endeavors which 
mark civilized society, especially in China, a country with the 
largest population of 1.2 billion and one of the fastest growing 
economies in the world.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhi (3769 5365): "CPC Newspapers, Journals </F>
Lose More Than 100 Million Yuan"] 
  [Text] At the beginning of each year, the CPC department 
concerned would, as a rule, review the work on party newspapers 
and journals. This year is no exception. As early as 17 January, 
the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee [CPCCC] 
issued a circular to all units around the country, under the 
title "Suggestions on Recommending Newspapers and Journals for 
Study by Party Organizations." The fact that the party media 
have to be "recommended" to party organizations by the CPCCC 
Propaganda Department shows that the party's mouthpiece cannot 
get a foothold on the market and must be supported by an 
administrative order. 
<H5>  Declining Circulations of Party Newspapers and Journals </H5>
  As revealed by the Information Office of the State 
Council, the circulations of party newspapers and journals have 
plummeted since last year when the State Council stipulated that 
personal subscriptions to such papers and journals be paid at 
personal expense. In general, the circulations of party and 
government journals at the central and local levels have fallen 
by 15 percent--in some cases, the drop has exceeded 50 percent. 
Statistic figures show that the annual loss suffered by 
newspapers and journals published by central and local 
government and party departments has totaled some 135 million 
yuan. 
  The Chinese Communists once elatedly boasted that RENMIN 
RIBAO was the paper with the largest circulation in the world. 
In fact, the paper is financially supported by the state coffer. 
Organs like RENMIN RIBAO are synonymous with "public 
newspapers." Without doubt, the "subscription at personal 
expense" stipulation, which went into effect last year, has 
served as the best public opinion poll [about people's 
confidence in the party media]. The over 135 million yuan loss 
is by no means a small amount; it is sufficient to send the 
press magnate of any country into bankruptcy. To the CPC, which 
maintains a one-party rule in China, however, the concern is not 
the huge loss of money, but the loss of public confidence in the 
party media as indicated by the sharp drop in their 
circulations. Such being the case, it is no matter of surprise 
that the CPCCC Propaganda Department has come out to act as a 
"recommender" for the party media. 
  The CPCCC Propaganda Department's circular requests that 
party organizations at all levels take it as the party's 
principal propaganda work to promote the study and reading of 
newspapers and journals so as to understand and get a grip on 
important domestic affairs and gain knowledge about major 
international events. According to the circular, party 
organizations should give periodical written tests to cadres 
with party membership to check their knowledge about major 
domestic and international events and use the test results as 
one of the criteria for their promotion or job assignment. Every 
member of the party organization, the circular urges, must 
subscribe to a party newspaper or journal. In remote areas, 
every village party organization and county propaganda 
department is responsible for subscribing a party newspaper and 
making arrangements for party members to study it on a regular 
basis. 
  While the CPCCC Propaganda Department has issued numerous 
orders in the past to urge party organizations at all levels to 
give attention to political study, never before has it required 
that cadres with party membership take a "written test" on the 
contents of party newspapers and that the test results be used 
as one of the criteria for "promotion." There is, indeed, some 
reason for doing this, but it cannot be said openly. 
<H5>  Real Situation of Circulations and Expenditures of the `Two </H5>
Newspapers and One Journal' 
  Besides the CPCCC Propaganda Department's circular, the 
Information Office of the State Council also issued on 24 
January a circular entitled "On Seriously Promoting the Work of 
All Media-Distribution and Publication Departments." The 
Information Office is quite clear about the concrete statistics 
on the distribution and publication of the party media. In 
addition to the above-mentioned annual loss of some 135 million 
yuan, there are many more figures, which are considered as 
"state secrets." Following are the real situation of 
circulations and expenditures of the "two newspapers and one 
journal" at the central level: 
  RENMIN RIBAO (Domestic Edition): The daily circulation in 
1992 was about 2.3 million. In 1993, the circulation was only 
1.65 million, down by 28 percent, and the excess expenditure 
amounted to some 8.3 million yuan. 
  GUANGMING RIBAO: The daily circulation in 1992 was about 
1.5 million. In 1993, this dropped to 850,000, down by 43 
percent, and the excess expenditure was some 3.1 million yuan. 
  QIUSHI magazine: In 1992, each issue had a circulation of 
about 1.5 million. In 1993, the figure dropped to 1.1 million, 
down by 27 percent, and the excess expenditure was more than 
860,000 yuan. 
  In comparison, the mainland's evening papers have a rather 
stable circulation because their contents are richer and more 
"liberal." A survey shows that the daily circulations of 
government and party newspapers and journals in the nation's 30 
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have dropped 
15 percent--in some cases more than 50 percent--with the 
exception of nine newspapers and journals including XINMIN 
WANBAO in Shanghai, YANGCHENG WANBAO in Guangdong, BEIJING 
WANBAO in Beijing, and CHENGDU WANBAO in Sichuan. More than 50 
party organs at the provincial level have excess expenditures. 
On the average, the excess expenditure is as high as more than 
60 percent. 
<H5>  Circulation of CANKAO XIAOXI Plummets </H5>
  What is worth mentioning is that CANKAO XIAOXI, the 
largest circulation publication in the country, was once widely 
received by readers as the only "other information source" under 
the CPC's information-blockade policy. During the past decade, 
however, its circulation has nose-dived, from 25 million in 1982 
to 16 million in 1988 and then to 8 million in 1993. The fall 
was 68 percent compared with the peak attained 11 years ago. 
  The declined circulation has worsened the problem of 
excess expenditures. For example, the three news agencies 
XINHUA, ZHONGXIN, and ZHONGTONG have an average excess 
expenditure of more than 60 million yuan [figure as published]. 
This does not include the special funds that the State Council 
has allocated to them for the purchase of supplies and 
communications equipment and for various large-scale activities. 
Specific figures follow: 
<H5>  Three Official News Agencies Have Excess Expenditure of 60 </H5>
Million Yuan [as published] 
  In 1993, the official XINHUA News Agency had an 
expenditure of 87 million yuan, showing an excess of some 13 
million yuan. 
  In 1993, ZHONGGUO XINWEN had an expenditure of 42 million 
yuan, showing an excess of some 8.6 million yuan. 
  In 1993, ZHONGGUO TONGXUN had an expenditure of 60 million 
yuan, showing an excess of some 9.7 million yuan. 
  Of the three news agencies, ZHONGXIN had the smallest 
excess expenditure. In addition to the above, there is a 
"record-breaking" figure: The Xinhua Bookstore's total sales of 
political and theoretical books throughout the country was 
305,000 books in 1993 (excluding My Father--Deng 
Xiaoping and Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, 
Volume III), hitting a record low since the founding of the 
People's Republic. More than 1.8 million books on politics were 
sold in 1950. The highest record was registered in 1967, when 
3.25 billion political and theoretical books were sold. 
  A low circulation--a high expenditure; a decline in 
circulation--a still higher expenditure. It seems that the CPC 
mouthpiece can hardly get out of this difficulty at the moment. 
Even the measure of linking party newspapers to promotions and 
pay raises will not produce any result. This is a disastrous 
effect of separating economic reform from political reform. Just 
think: When people are enjoying every day the material life 
created by capitalism, how could they believe the party's 
stereotyped propaganda that "only socialism can save China"?

<F P=106> ["Work Report of Jiangxi Provincial Higher People's Court </F>
Delivered by Li Xiuyuan (2621 0208 3293) at the Second Session 
of the Eighth Jiangxi Provincial People's Congress on 27 
February 1994"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] I. Deal Severe Blows at 
Serious Criminal and Economic Cases, Safeguard Social Stability 
and Wage Struggles against Corruption 
  Social stability is the necessary pre-requisite and 
guarantee to promoting the reform and opening-up program and 
developing economic construction. To punish criminals according 
to law, safeguard social stability and create a fine social 
environment for developing the reform and opening-up program and 
economic construction is the major responsibility of the 
people's court. The courts at all levels in the province had 
continued to implement the principle of "dealing heavy blows at 
criminal offenses" and persistently and unflinching waged 
struggles to strike at heinous criminals. In 1993, Jiangxi had 
handled 9,426 criminal cases of the first instance and completed 
9,304 of them. Among the 12,807 criminal offenders to whom 
judgments have already become effective, 33.8 percent of them 
were sentenced to more than five years of fixed imprisonment, 
life imprisonment or death (including death penalty with a 
suspension of execution); 65.5 percent of them were sentenced to 
less than five years of fixed-term imprisonment, criminal 
retention and public surveillance or given exemption from 
criminal sanctions; and 0.7 percent of them were found not 
guilty. 
  In their struggle against crimes which seriously endanger 
public security, the courts at all levels paid attention to the 
following work: 
  1. They concentrated their efforts on handling major cases. 
They promptly handled, from the beginning to the end, those 
criminal cases involving killing, robbery, kidnapping, rape and 
hooligan activities, particularly major crimes committed by 
criminal gangs. In all the criminal cases completed in 1993, 
43.8 percent or 4,081 cases and 63 percent or 7,856 criminals 
were involved in the aforementioned offenses. 
  2. They continued to coordinate with relevant departments 
to vigorously wage struggles against larceny, train and highway 
robberies, abducting and selling children, forcing women into 
prostitution. Proceeding from reality, various localities dealt 
heavy blows to those crimes on the priority list, and attained 
remarkable results. In 1993, Jiangxi handled 652 cases involving 
larceny and prosecuted 1,048 suspects; 282 cases involving the 
"six evils" and prosecuted 414 offenders; and handled 303 cases 
involving train and highway robberies and prosecuted 831 
offenders. 
  3. They strengthened their forces to strike at criminal 
activities, and persistently followed the principle of meting 
out severe and swift punishment to criminals who serious 
endangered public security. About 94 percent of the cases 
wounded up in 1993 were completed within the legally prescribed 
time limits. The number of heinous criminals sentenced to more 
than five years of fixed-term imprisonment or death penalty rose 
8.4 percent in 1993. 
  To deal heavy blows at criminals is an important aspect of 
the struggle waged by the people's courts against criminal 
activities. Economic crimes seriously jeopardized the ties of 
the party and government with the masses, hindered the reform 
and opening up program and interfered with economic 
construction. The courts at all levels in the province had 
continued to regard the struggle to strike at criminal crimes as 
something of great significance in combating corruption, in 
keeping a honest and clean government and in promoting economic 
development. They firmly adhered to the principle of severely 
punishing serious economic offenders in accordance with law. In 
1993, people's courts in Jiangxi had accepted 990 economic cases 
of the first instance publicly prosecuted by the procuratorial 
organs, and completed 944 of them. Except those cases for which 
appeals were being lodged and those which were sent back to 
procuratorial organs for reinvestigation or withdrawal, actions 
taken against 1,865 offenders had already become legally 
effective, of whom 765 were sentenced to more than five years of 
fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment and death, 1,100 of 
them were sentenced to less than five years of fixed-term 
imprisonment, criminal retention and public surveillance, 114 
were exempted from criminal sanctions and 23 of them were found 
not guilty. Among the criminals convicted, 197 committed 
offenses involving more than 10,000 yuan each and 56 committed 
crimes involving over 100,000 yuan each. A total of 5.91 million 
yuan of economic losses were recovered for the state. 
  In order to further intensify the struggle against 
corruption, the people's courts in the province had persistently 
struck at corrupt state functionaries who accepted bribery and 
engaged in embezzlement. They resolutely meted out punishment on 
this type of offenses as soon as the cases were accepted by the 
court and the suspects were proved guilty. In 1993, Jiangxi 
completed 149 cases of the first instance involving corruption, 
bribery and embezzlement, accounting for 16 percent of all the 
criminal cases. Two hundred fifteen offenders were convicted 
including eight county and department-level cadres. At the same 
time, actions were taken to severely deal with smugglers, 
swindlers and tax dodgers and those who faked trademarks; sold 
and manufactured fake and shoddy merchandise; and seriously 
undermined the economic order. In 1993, Jiangxi had concluded 
109 trials of the aforementioned category, and convicted 184 
offenders whose sentences had already become legally effective. 
In dealing with offenses of this category, other punishments 
such as imposing fines, confiscating properties and others were 
also meted out along with other severe punishments so as to 
prevent the criminals from reaping economic benefits. 
  After the arrangements were made by the second plenary 
session of the CPC Central Discipline Inspection Commission for 
the anti-corruption struggle in August 1993, the courts at 
various levels in the province had exerted even greater efforts 
in striking at economic crimes. They strengthened their efforts 
to handle the major cases exposed in the anti-corruption 
struggle and completed the trials in a timely manner, once the 
procuratorial organs started the prosecution procedure. They 
paid full attention to facts and the evidence and handled all 
cases in accordance with law. They closely followed the 
principle of "being firm, prudent and accurate," and ensured 
that all cases were handled properly and carefully. From 
September to December 1993, Jiangxi had accepted and concluded 
517 economic cases, up 90 cases over the same period in 1992. 
There were 133 major cases involving corruption, bribery and 
embezzlement for which 11 criminals were sentenced to more than 
10 years of fixed-term imprisonment; two of them to life 
imprisonment and another two to the death penalty with a 
suspension of execution. In addition, two of the criminals were 
sentenced to death, pending the approval of the Supreme People's 
Court. In order to meet the requirements set by the central 
authorities and the provincial CPC committee to attain 
achievements against corruption in different stages in the near 
future, the people's courts in various localities held 
sentence-pronouncing rallies during which verdicts were passed 
on a group of major criminal offenders involving corruption, 
bribery and embezzlement. At the end of 1993, the provincial 
people's court had taken an unified action to pronounce 
sentences on a number of major cases which attracted widespread 
attention of the general public. It made a province-wide group 
announcement in public and even held a news briefing in this 
connection. It created a great impact and good social effects on 
the society. 
<H5>  II. Regulate Economic Relations in Accordance With Law, </H5>
Actively Serve Macro-Control and Develop Market Economy 
  In the course of promoting the national economy with a high 
speed last year, there emerged some contradictions and problems 
in China's economic life. Some of them were quite outstanding. 
The party CPC Committee made a timely policy decision to 
strengthen and improve the macro-economic control. In order to 
ensure the smooth implementation of the major policy decision 
made by the central authorities and maintain the normal economic 
order, the people's courts at various levels throughout the 
province adopted effective measures to vigorously strengthen 
their efforts in trying cases involving economic crimes. In 
1993, they handled a total of 38,285 economic cases of the first 
instance with a total amount of 966 million yuan involved, up 
35.7 percent and 129 percent respectively over 1992. 
  We had paid particular attention to handling the following 
types of cases. 
  1) We actively handled cases involving state-owned 
enterprises which were changing the way they operated; 
protected, in accordance with law, the legal interests of the 
enterprises and the managing companies by trying cases which 
involved contracting, leasing, joint operation, merging, 
shareholding and bankruptcy procedures for various enterprises. 
We had helped enterprises change the way their operated and 
establish a modern enterprise system; and provided them with the 
legal protection to become market-oriented. In 1993, Jiangxi had 
handled a total of 1,204 cases of the aforementioned nature, 
accounting for 3.2 percent of the total number of cases handled. 
  2) We concentrated our efforts in handling cases involving 
marketing, money-borrowing, financing, investment in 
shareholding form, patent, trademark and disputes over 
technological contracts; and helped improve the markets for 
merchandise, funds and technologies. In 1993, Jiangxi had 
handled 26,086 cases of this category, accounting for 68 percent 
of the total number of cases handled. Many of the cases were of 
a new variety. With the rapid development of the reform program 
in China and the legislature lagging hind, the courts in various 
localities extensively conducted investigation and studies, 
continuously summed up their experiences, and followed the basic 
principle that they applied laws whenever there were laws in 
this connection. They applied the policy whenever there are no 
laws or regulations in this connection. They acted in accordance 
with the basic principle of the law when both the law and the 
policy in this connection were not so clear. We persistently 
handled cases in accordance with the principle of the "three 
conducive's." 
  3) We properly handled cases concerning the development of 
rural economy. In 1993, Jiangxi had handled 2,161 cases 
involving disputes over the rural contract system, up 3.4 
percent over 1992. At the same time, we had also handled a large 
number of economic disputes among rural enterprises. By means of 
various adjudicative activities, we had safeguarded the 
household contract responsibility system, helped rural 
enterprises improve their management and invigorated the rural 
economy in an overall manner. 
  In order to keep pace with the new situation in economic 
development and satisfy the growing needs for the judicial 
sector to serve the market economy, the people's courts at 
various levels had improved their services and their work, and 
provided legal consultations for the development of economic 
construction. They adopted the following measures: 
  1. They carried out specialized judicial work in 
coordination with the macro-control. They took the initiative to 
help the financial sector collect its loans in accordance with 
law, support the tax authorities to levy taxes and assist the 
land office and the transportation department to collect 
necessary fees. They also helped the various enterprises clear 
up their debts, assisted people settle their economic disputes, 
and helped maintain the normal economic order. 
  2. They simplified the litigation procedure and raise their 
efficiency in handling cases. They vigorously carried out their 
mediation work, provided supervision and ensured that all legal 
procedures were properly followed. They made efforts to reduce 
some unnecessary steps in lawsuit. In 1993, 69.1 percent of the 
cases involving economic disputes were concluded through 
mediation. The various basic-level people's courts handled 
12,011 cases involving simple economic disputes. 
  3. They took the initiative to provide legal services in 
various enterprises and economic departments at the latter's 
doorsteps. They sometimes set up liaison offices or send out 
tribunals to help enterprises and the departments concerned 
clear up their debts, settle economic disputes, become more 
competitive on the market, train people to handle legal affairs, 
run business in accordance with law. Their measures taken were 
warmly praised by the enterprises and the departments concerned. 
<H5>  III. Correctly and Properly Handle Civil and Administrative </H5>
Cases; and Protect legal Rights and Interests of citizens, Legal 
Persons and Other Organizations in Accordance With Law 
  To protect the legal rights and interests of citizens and 
legal persons from encroachment is an important aspect of 
socialist democracy and the legal system. To correctly and 
timely handle civil and administrative cases is of great 
significance in maintaining social stability, promoting 
production and developing spiritual civilization. 
  Civil rights are basic rights of the citizens and legal 
persons. With more changes taking place in society and people's 
mind and with the rapid development of the market economy, 
contacts among the people have become closer, and there are more 
civil cases for the people's courts to handle. Particularly with 
the continuous development of the legal relations in civil 
affairs, the number of cases involving properties and individual 
rights and interests is on the increase every year. The work in 
handling civil cases has become more closely related with 
economic construction, especially with the development of the 
market economy. In 1993, Jiangxi had concluded 66,521 civil 
cases of the first instance, up 32.1 percent over 1992. It had 
placed emphasis on handling civil cases of the following 
categories: 
  1) It handled many civil cases involving marriage and family 
problems. For many years in the past, the number of divorce 
cases ranked top among all the civil cases handled. In 1993, 
Jiangxi had concluded 23,252 cases of this category. With the 
changes of the people's concept on marriage, family and 
property, not only the number of divorce cases is increasing, 
there are more problems in dividing properties, child-care and 
housing allotment. The people's courts properly handled divorce 
cases in strict accordance with the Marriage Law, and helped 
strengthen the socialist system about marriage and family. 
  2) It energetically handled trials concerning liabilities, 
real estate and labor disputes. With the vigorous development of 
the reform and opening-up program and the booming economic 
activities within the nongovernment sector, there were 
increasing number of disputes concerning debts, real estate and 
labor. In 1993, Jiangxi had concluded 13,172 cases concerning 
debts, 894 cases on houses and 465 cases involving labor 
disputes. By handling trials of these categories, the people's 
courts had made the money, real estate and labor markets 
flourish. 
  3) It had properly handled civil cases involving disputes on 
land, forest, water conservancy, ownership of or the rights to 
use plots for housing projects. In 1993, Jiangxi concluded 330 
cases of this category. Most of these cases were in the rural 
areas. They directly affected production and livelihood of the 
masses, and at times, problems became quite serious. By properly 
handling such cases, the people's courts had timely solved the 
problems, eliminated the factors of instability, helped maintain 
social stability in rural areas and promoted agricultural 
production. 
  The trial of administrative cases is an important step in 
developing the socialist democratic politics. Since the official 
enactment of the "Administrative Procedure Law of the People's 
Republic of China" on 1 October 1990, the work of administrative 
trials has entered a new stage in Jiangxi. The number of 
administrative lawsuits was on the increase every year, and the 
scope of litigation is continuously expanding. In 1993, Jiangxi 
had handled 805 administrative cases, up 21.9 percent over 1992. 
It had concluded 786 cases in which the ruling of the 
administrative organization was upheld in 33 percent of the 
cases, annulled in 20 percent of the cases, and changed in 2.2 
percent of the cases. The plaintiffs withdrew suits in 35.8 
percent of the cases. In addition, 1,744 cases were handled 
involving a total amount of 2.43 million yuan, whereas 
administrative organs had requested that judgements be forcibly 
executed. 
  In the course of handling administrative lawsuits, the 
people's courts not only protected, in accordance with law, the 
legal interests of the citizens and legal persons and other 
organizations, but also helped and supervised the administrative 
organs to exercise their functions and powers. They mainly paid 
attention to the following tasks: 
  1. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases 
involving enterprises' autonomy in management, preventing others 
from infringing upon the rights of the enterprises, safeguarding 
their market share and interests and helping them change the way 
they operate. 
  2. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases which 
involved land, industrial and commercial administration, 
taxation, finance, foreign exchange, commodity price and 
technological supervision and management, and in maintaining 
order for market competition. Meanwhile, they thwarted improper 
actions of the administrative organizations and other illegal 
administrative measures which undermined the economy, punished 
the enterprises without the proper authority, indiscriminately 
meting out punishments, recklessly set up roadblocks, collected 
excessive fees, and illegally increase peasants' burdens. 
  3. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases which 
involved public security, shelter and surveillance, re-education 
through labor and infringement of citizens' rights. They 
protected, in accordance with law, the interests of the 
citizens; eliminated the sense of antagonism between the 
administrative organizations and the public; and reduced the 
factors of social instability. 
  4. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases whereas 
the administrative organs had requested that judgments be 
executed by force, supported administrative organs in carrying 
out their work and help them maintain their administrative 
authority. Cases involving the execution of administrative 
orders often aroused major public interests, involved the 
overall situation of state administration, and directly affected 
economic construction and social stability. In handing cases of 
this category, the people's courts had persistently followed the 
principle of being vigorous, reliable and safe. They not only 
dared to help administrative organs implement their orders, but 
also carried out a great deal of publicity, re-education and 
persuasion work to help ease contradictions. 
  During the past year, Jiangxi had steadily and continuously 
extended their legal services in handling administrative 
lawsuits. However, the system of administrative lawsuits had not 
been established too long, the people's courts were still 
unfamiliar with lawsuits of this category, and some of the 
judicial cadres who handle such cases still showed sentiments of 
fearing difficulties. Therefore, to further study, popularize 
and implement the Law of Administrative Procedure remains an 
important task in the near future. The people's courts at 
various levels are earnestly summing up their experiences, 
overcoming difficulties, continuously improving the environment 
in enforcing this law and marching forward in handling 
administrative lawsuits. 
<H5>  IV. Rely on Judicial Work, Actively Improve All Facets of </H5>
Public Security in Society 
  To improve all facets of public security in the society is a 
basic policy in maintaining a lasting order in our country. It 
also represents a basic principle of Chinese characteristics in 
doing our judicial work. In handling trials of all types over 
the past year, the people's courts at various levels throughout 
the country paid attention to performing their functions well in 
carrying out their judicial work, and energetically improved all 
the facets of public security in society. They mainly performed 
the following duties: 
  1) They persistently held open trials, gave widespread 
publicity to the socialist legal system and called on people to 
observe discipline and abide by laws. The courts in the province 
held a total 465 rallies to announce judgments with a total 
audience of 3.12 million people in the last year. 
  2) In the course of dealing with the lawsuits, they also 
made judicial suggestions. When they tried cases of various 
categories, they discovered that some departments and units had 
many loopholes and problems in their management system. In light 
of these loopholes and problems, they made judicial suggestions. 
In 1993, Jiangxi had made 3,576 judicial suggestions, a great 
majority of which were accepted by the units concerned. It had 
attained remarkable social effects. 
  3) They strengthened their work for juvenile courts. They 
meted out appropriate penalties on young criminals, while 
protecting the legal rights and interests of the juvenile 
delinquents. Meanwhile some juvenile courts also sponsored study 
classes and parents' schools to educate juvenile delinquents by 
persuasion and prevent them from committing crimes again. 
  4) Proceeding from the desire to reform juvenile delinquents 
and prevent them from committing crimes once again, they often 
reduced their sentences, put them on probation or released them 
on parole in accordance with law. In 1993, Jiangxi reduced 
sentences in 6,490 cases, released 553 juvenile delinquents on 
parole and put 1,888 of them on probation, accounting for 15 
percent of the total number of delinquents. A system was set up 
in many localities to visit juvenile delinquents on probation or 
parole after they were released. The juvenile courts also 
coordinated with the departments concerned and the basic-level 
organizations to help those on parole or probation to reform and 
educate themselves. 
  5) They carried out their mass work well inside and outside 
the courts, and correctly used legal means to solve various 
kinds of contradictions. The people's courts at various levels 
paid full attention to enhancing social stability; implemented 
the policy of correctly handling the contradictions among the 
people; and used this policy to guide their judicial work. The 
civil and administrative lawsuits involve many aspects and are 
closely related with the masses. Through these civil and 
administrative cases, the people's courts understood the 
situation in the community well, made preparations way ahead to 
help various departments concerned solve various contradictions 
and problems. In handling civil and administrative lawsuits, the 
people's courts in the province continued to uphold the 
principle of conducting mediation to solve disputes, always 
tried to reason things with both parties in dispute and helped 
them to accommodate each other and reach agreement on their own 
accord, to end their disputes and to avoid the accumulation of 
contradictions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "It Will Be a Difficult Task To Overcome </F>
Difficulties and Rebuild Economic Success"] 
  [Text] Economic development is not a smooth and steady 
process, but rather one in which various difficulties and 
problems are encountered regularly and need timely resolution. 
In the course of economic development, as domestic and 
external climates change and subjective and objective factors 
clash, new problems and difficulties may arise at any time 
which, if not dealt with properly and carefully, will often 
cause economic growth to stagnate or decline. 
  While Taiwan's economic development over the last four-plus 
decades has certainly created a world-acknowledged miracle, an 
examination of this process leaves a profound impression about 
how hard it was to achieve. In this four-plus decades, we have 
encountered so many difficulties, bottlenecks, and problems, so 
that it was only by relying on the efforts of all throughout 
Taiwan to overcome the extreme hardships and difficulties that 
we were able to turn a rugged path into a smooth one, moving 
from plowing to harvesting, and having today's success. 
  When we began our active development in the 1950s, except 
for 
an abundant workforce, Taiwan had little else. Not only were we 
short on resources and money, but our technology was backward 
and our markets were narrow. But under such adverse conditions, 
our government rewarded savings, rectified its finances, 
attracted foreign investment, utilized foreign aid, readopted 
regulations to reward investment, and vigorously expanded export 
trade. Finally, by the 1960s, Taiwan's rapid economic growth, 
sharp expansion of foreign trade, and conversion of a 
longstanding trade deficit into a longstanding surplus, had 
brought increased worldwide respect for Taiwan's economic 
development, with Taiwan being cited as one of the "four Asian 
dragons." 
  But after the first world oil crisis in 1973, domestic and 
external shocks came in unending waves. Domestically, our 
capital construction was severely inadequate, with our labor 
shortage blocking further growth of our manufacturing industry. 
Externally, the sharp rise in oil prices caused worldwide 
stagnant growth and the development of trade protectionism. If 
Taiwan's economic development had not been smoothly adjusted at 
that time, our economy could very possibly have stagnated. 
Fortunately, our government made an overall adjustment of its 
economic policy at that time, on one hand going all out to push 
forward with 10 construction projects, not only relying on this 
to reinforce our public infrastructures, but also hoping that 
the increased public investment would stimulate expanded private 
investment. Meanwhile, it set forth a new development goal, 
emphasizing development of technology- and capital-intensive 
industries to accelerate our economic upgrading. With this 
government policy guidance and all-out private support, Taiwan's 
economic development finally rose to new heights, entering a 
smooth path, and moving to a higher development level, to turn 
Taiwan into a genuine rising industrialized nation. 
  Due to our successful economic development conversion, not 
only did our break in diplomatic relations with the U.S. not 
have a severe impact on our economy, but since the 1980s, our 
government's revision of its economic development goals, or 
promotion of liberalization and internationalization, and the 
gradual opening of contacts across the Taiwan strait, with 
Taiwan not only expanding trade relations with all countries in 
the Asia-Paciic region, but also establishing indirect trade 
relations with the mainland, have also brought a change to the 
economic situation of the whole Asia-Pacific region. Taiwan has 
undoubtedly played a crucial role in this change, which will 
make us a key player in future economic cooperation in the 
Asia-pacific region. 
  Of course, along with this change in economic situation, we 
have certainly experienced new economic problems and 
difficulties. 
  1. Domestically, due to population growth, urban expansion, 
and industrial development, the demand for industrial, 
construction, and fallow land has grown daily, with the 
unchanged land supply causing skyrocketing real estate prices 
and land speculation, and the national housing shortage causing 
discontent among the homeless. The difficulty in finding 
industrial land has lowered industrialists' investment 
aspirations. Labor-intensive industries in particular, have been 
forced to move abroad for their very existence, seeking a second 
spring overseas. 
  2. Due to rising incomes and improvements in consumer goods, 
the public has not only acquired a higher awareness of 
environmental protection, but also has made higher demands on 
our social welfare system in areas, such as national insurance, 
annuities, and old-age pensions. Of course, as a modern nation, 
a social welfare system is an indispensable qualification. 
  3. As our economy has advanced and our production increased, 
our public infrastructures have become inadequate. Our 
freeways, express-delivery system, parking lots, port and 
airport facilities, and public transportation are all unable to 
meet current needs. 
  4. Our government's need to reinforce our public facilities 
and expand our social welfare system requires enormous spending. 
But as revenues have not grown correspondingly, we have 
experienced heavy financial pressures, with an ever-growing 
financial burden and fiscal deficits growing yearly, leaving our 
responsible fiscal sector sighing about the difficulties! 
  5. Internationally, the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations 
was concluded in Geneva on 15 December 1993, with a final 
agreement having been reached. Meanwhile, the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) will be established on 1 January 1995, and at 
the latest by 1 July. Unless Taiwan can join the GATT before the 
end of 1994, we will be unable to become a founding member of 
the WTO, meaning that we will be unable to enjoy the benefits to 
be granted by that organization to its members. 
  As Executive Yuan Economics Council Director Hsiao 
Wan-ch'ang 
[5618 8001 7022] pointed out in a report to the KMT Standing 
Committee on 6 April 1994, Taiwan's economy is now at a 
long-range development turning point, in which we have a fine 
opportunity to reach new heights and develop a new order, to 
become a star of the 21st century; while similarly, due to the 
abovementioned five factors, unless we can appropriately 
overcome them, facing the possibility of landing in an economic 
stagnation crisis. So what are we to do? Let us see if we can 
make the wise choice, by making the great effort to overcome the 
difficulties, and through striving to rebuild our economic 
success. 
  We highly endorse the future work priorities set forth by 
Director Hsiao in his report, such as joining the GATT, planning 
to become the working center of the Asia-Pacific region, 
implementing our infrastructure plans, planning housing 
construction, planning and reorganizing our national annuity 
system, reassessing our land resources distribution rationality 
and water supply usage, reforming our government's fiscal 
system, and raising our administrative efficiency. Some of 
these priorities are merely goals awaiting our efforts, while 
others are particular jobs that are in urgent need of 
completion. The basic crux of our land and housing problem is 
that our land problem must be solved. This is not merely to 
acquire abundant industrial and housing construction space, but 
more so to eliminate land speculation, so that land benefits are 
enjoyed by the whole society, not monopolized by the few. In 
planning national annuities, we need to act in coordination with 
reform of our fiscal system, by acting gradually, orderly, and 
in line with our capabilities. Instead of giving the government 
a too large fiscal burden, we need to consider the principle of 
equality and justice. In public construction, we need to link 
this to higher administrative efficiency, eliminating waste, 
raising project quality, and preventing interference by special 
privilege. 
  But even more importantly, in order to achieve our goals of 
joining the GATT and planning to become the working center of 
the Asia-Pacific region, matters, such as how to stimulate 
domestic investment aspirations, upgrade our technology, adjust 
our industrial structure, expand our foreign trade markets, and 
protect our domestic ecology, are steps that directly involve 
raising productivity and speeding up our economic upgrading, 
requiring even more attention and active promotion. With 
conscientious efforts in these areas, we will be more able to 
reach new heights and rebuild our economic success.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "It Will Be a Difficult Task To Overcome </F>
Difficulties and Rebuild Economic Success"] 
  [Text] Economic development is not a smooth and steady 
process, but rather one in which various difficulties and 
problems are encountered regularly and need timely resolution. 
In the course of economic development, as domestic and 
external climates change and subjective and objective factors 
clash, new problems and difficulties may arise at any time 
which, if not dealt with properly and carefully, will often 
cause economic growth to stagnate or decline. 
  While Taiwan's economic development over the last four-plus 
decades has certainly created a world-acknowledged miracle, an 
examination of this process leaves a profound impression about 
how hard it was to achieve. In this four-plus decades, we have 
encountered so many difficulties, bottlenecks, and problems, so 
that it was only by relying on the efforts of all throughout 
Taiwan to overcome the extreme hardships and difficulties that 
we were able to turn a rugged path into a smooth one, moving 
from plowing to harvesting, and having today's success. 
  When we began our active development in the 1950s, except 
for 
an abundant workforce, Taiwan had little else. Not only were we 
short on resources and money, but our technology was backward 
and our markets were narrow. But under such adverse conditions, 
our government rewarded savings, rectified its finances, 
attracted foreign investment, utilized foreign aid, readopted 
regulations to reward investment, and vigorously expanded export 
trade. Finally, by the 1960s, Taiwan's rapid economic growth, 
sharp expansion of foreign trade, and conversion of a 
longstanding trade deficit into a longstanding surplus, had 
brought increased worldwide respect for Taiwan's economic 
development, with Taiwan being cited as one of the "four Asian 
dragons." 
  But after the first world oil crisis in 1973, domestic and 
external shocks came in unending waves. Domestically, our 
capital construction was severely inadequate, with our labor 
shortage blocking further growth of our manufacturing industry. 
Externally, the sharp rise in oil prices caused worldwide 
stagnant growth and the development of trade protectionism. If 
Taiwan's economic development had not been smoothly adjusted at 
that time, our economy could very possibly have stagnated. 
Fortunately, our government made an overall adjustment of its 
economic policy at that time, on one hand going all out to push 
forward with 10 construction projects, not only relying on this 
to reinforce our public infrastructures, but also hoping that 
the increased public investment would stimulate expanded private 
investment. Meanwhile, it set forth a new development goal, 
emphasizing development of technology- and capital-intensive 
industries to accelerate our economic upgrading. With this 
government policy guidance and all-out private support, Taiwan's 
economic development finally rose to new heights, entering a 
smooth path, and moving to a higher development level, to turn 
Taiwan into a genuine rising industrialized nation. 
  Due to our successful economic development conversion, not 
only did our break in diplomatic relations with the U.S. not 
have a severe impact on our economy, but since the 1980s, our 
government's revision of its economic development goals, or 
promotion of liberalization and internationalization, and the 
gradual opening of contacts across the Taiwan strait, with 
Taiwan not only expanding trade relations with all countries in 
the Asia-Paciic region, but also establishing indirect trade 
relations with the mainland, have also brought a change to the 
economic situation of the whole Asia-Pacific region. Taiwan has 
undoubtedly played a crucial role in this change, which will 
make us a key player in future economic cooperation in the 
Asia-pacific region. 
  Of course, along with this change in economic situation, we 
have certainly experienced new economic problems and 
difficulties. 
  1. Domestically, due to population growth, urban expansion, 
and industrial development, the demand for industrial, 
construction, and fallow land has grown daily, with the 
unchanged land supply causing skyrocketing real estate prices 
and land speculation, and the national housing shortage causing

environmental protection, but also has made higher demands on 
our social welfare system in areas, such as national insurance, 
annuities, and old-age pensions. Of course, as a modern nation, 
a social welfare system is an indispensable qualification. 
  3. As our economy has advanced and our production increased, 
our public infrastructures have become inadequate. Our 
freeways, express-delivery system, parking lots, port and 
airport facilities, and public transportation are all unable to 
meet current needs. 
  4. Our government's need to reinforce our public facilities 
and expand our social welfare system requires enormous spending. 
But as revenues have not grown correspondingly, we have 
experienced heavy financial pressures, with an ever-growing 
financial burden and fiscal deficits growing yearly, leaving our 
responsible fiscal sector sighing about the difficulties! 
  5. Internationally, the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations 
was concluded in Geneva on 15 December 1993, with a final 
agreement having been reached. Meanwhile, the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) will be established on 1 January 1995, and at 
the latest by 1 July. Unless Taiwan can join the GATT before the 
end of 1994, we will be unable to become a founding member of 
the WTO, meaning that we will be unable to enjoy the benefits to 
be granted by that organization to its members. 
  As Executive Yuan Economics Council Director Hsiao 
Wan-ch'ang 
[5618 8001 7022] pointed out in a report to the KMT Standing 
Committee on 6 April 1994, Taiwan's economy is now at a 
long-range development turning point, in which we have a fine 
opportunity to reach new heights and develop a new order, to 
become a star of the 21st century; while similarly, due to the

stagnation crisis. So what are we to do? Let us see if we can 
make the wise choice, by making the great effort to overcome the 
difficulties, and through striving to rebuild our economic 
success. 
  We highly endorse the future work priorities set forth by 
Director Hsiao in his report, such as joining the GATT, planning 
to become the working center of the Asia-Pacific region, 
implementing our infrastructure plans, planning housing 
construction, planning and reorganizing our national annuity 
system, reassessing our land resources distribution rationality 
and water supply usage, reforming our government's fiscal 
system, and raising our administrative efficiency. Some of 
these priorities are merely goals awaiting our efforts, while 
others are particular jobs that are in urgent need of 
completion. The basic crux of our land and housing problem is 
that our land problem must be solved. This is not merely to 
acquire abundant industrial and housing construction space, but 
more so to eliminate land speculation, so that land benefits are 
enjoyed by the whole society, not monopolized by the few. In 
planning national annuities, we need to act in coordination with 
reform of our fiscal system, by acting gradually, orderly, and 
in line with our capabilities. Instead of giving the government 
a too large fiscal burden, we need to consider the principle of 
equality and justice. In public construction, we need to link 
this to higher administrative efficiency, eliminating waste, 
raising project quality, and preventing interference by special 
privilege. 
  But even more importantly, in order to achieve our goals of 
joining the GATT and planning to become the working center of 
the Asia-Pacific region, matters, such as how to stimulate 
domestic investment aspirations, upgrade our technology, adjust 
our industrial structure, expand our foreign trade markets, and 
protect our domestic ecology, are steps that directly involve 
raising productivity and speeding up our economic upgrading, 
requiring even more attention and active promotion. With 
conscientious efforts in these areas, we will be more able to 
reach new heights and rebuild our economic success.

<F P=106> [Article by Fang Su (2455 5685): "Hong Kong Economy: 1994 </F>
Outlook Good All Along the Line?"] 
  [Text] A quarrel between China and the UK has greatly 
damaged the political atmosphere, but feelings of political 
uncertainty have vanished. People think: So what if there is a 
spat? The outlook for the coming year is generally good for the 
four main components of Hong Kong's economy: trade, the stock 
market, real estate, and economic relations and trade between 
China and Hong Kong, as well as for employment. 
  Hong Kong is a large corporation that is about to change 
hands. The old boss is about to leave, and the new boss is 
waiting to take over. However, the old and the new bosses are on 
the outs with each other. They quarrel from morning until night. 
What is interesting is that even though the bosses squabble, the 
sky has not fallen. The work of the corporation has not only not 
been impaired but has become more intense, and prospects are 
that tomorrow will be better. 
  The following is the general situation in Hong Kong today: 
Because of the wrangling between China and Hong Kong over the 
political system, the political atmosphere has been greatly 
damaged. Economically, however, even though political factors 
unavoidably affect the economy, the people's general reaction 
is: So what if China and the UK are having a spat? This also 
makes sense. Before the two parties had a falling out, everyone 
had a feeling of uncertainly because the political haze had 
still not cleared. Now that they have turned on each other, each 
taking up diametrically opposed positions, the feeling of 
political uncertainty has vanished. Psychologically, everyone is 
"relieved." Actually, despite the bad political atmosphere, both 
the Chinese and the British know that the "economic card" is a 
bad one to play. What can the Chinese Communists do to the Hong 
Kong economy? At most, they may be able to continue to drag 
their feet on the financial arrangements for the new airport. 
Other matters pertaining to special operating rights may be side 
issues, but mostly certain British-owned businesses would be 
hurt. Aside from this, the Chinese Communists cannot bear down 
too hard without damaging Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. 
What is more, Chinese capital is at risk in Hong Kong, and Hong 
Kong has such great economic value to the China mainland. 
  Inasmuch as the political atmosphere has gone from 
uncertainty to relative certainty, political factors may be set 
aside for the time being when discussing Hong Kong's economic 
situation and prospects. Because the sky has not fallen, and the 
basic elements in Hong Kong's economy are relatively good, it is 
generally estimated that Hong Kong's economic growth during 1994 
will be on a par with 1993. Actual growth will be more than 5 
percent. Below, an evaluation of Hong Kong's future economic 
situation is made on the basis of four things: 1) trade, 2) the 
stock market, 3) real estate, 4) and Sino-Hong Kong economic 
relations and trade, which taken together can convey an overall 
picture of Hong Kong's economy. 
<H5>  Trade: Growth of Two Large Markets </H5>
  Abroad, inventories are low while mainland growth is 
high. The trend of the two large markets can be perceived, and 
trade prospects can be half predicted. 
  Hong Kong's economy has always depended on trade. 
  One source of data for evaluating Hong Kong's trade 
situation 
in the coming year is the semi-official report that the Hong 
Kong Trade Development Bureau published at the beginning of 
December 1993 titled, "Hong Kong Trade Prospects in 1994." This 
research report may be summarized in the following two points: 
  1. Overseas markets are reviving slowly, but inventories are 
low. In principal markets such as the United States, recovery 
remains slow, but prospects are better than last year. Such 
areas have imported little for some time, and they have pretty 
well sold their inventories. If their economy takes an upturn 
and the consumer market picks up, orders will increase. 
  2. The China mainland shows high growth, but inflation is a 
worry. The China mainland economy has grown rapidly in recent 
years. Its annual growth rate is 13 percent. During the last 
half of 1993, regulation and control was instituted with a 
tightening of credit, but recently the money supply has been 
relaxed again. Economic growth during 1994 should be vigorous, 
but the rise in inflationary pressures and a possible new 
government retrenchment during the second half of the year are 
worrisome. 
  This report rests on two basic assumptions, namely that the 
United States will continue to extend the China mainland's most 
favored nation trade status. On the basis of this assumption, 
the report predicts that Hong Kong's exports will improve in 
1994, total export value increasing 18 percent, for an actual 17 
percent increase. (The 1993 estimate was 14 percent.) Entrepot 
trade is also expected to increase by an actual 23 percent. (The 
1993 estimate was 20 percent.) 
  The United States and China are Hong Kong's largest markets 
(together accounting for half or more of Hong Kong's exports, 
and more than half of its total entrepot trade). The situation 
in 1994 will be one in which the United States market will grow 
fairly steadily and the China mainland market may slow during 
the second half of the year. By understanding the trend of 
these two large markets, it is possible to know in advance most 
of Hong Kong's trade prospects. 
  Of the issues between China and the United States, the one 
that affects Hong Kong most is whether China's most favored 
nation status will be extended. The importance for Hong Kong of 
most favored nation treatment lies in the current reality that 
China's and Hong Kong's economies are closely linked. The 
mainland is the factory, and Hong Kong is the store. Many 
mainland products transit Hong Kong for sale abroad. 
  In recent years, both the Hong Kong government and 
businessmen have sent leading figures to the United States each 
year to lobby in an effort to get the United States to extend 
China's most favored nation treatment. Their most important line 
has been that unless most favored nation treatment is extended, 
Hong Kong will lose 70,000 jobs and 3 percentage points of its 
GNP. 
  Although whether the United States will extend China's most 
favored nation treatment in 1994 is still an unknown quantity, 
everyone assumes it will be maintained. The first condition for 
extension that the United States has expressed is improvement of 
the China mainland's human rights situation. In this regard, it 
is estimated that Beijing will do all possible to take some 
actions and improve its posture to maintain most favored nation 
treatment. In the final analysis, Beijing also realizes that it 
cannot be swayed by personal feelings. As for the United States, 
recently there have also been some indications that it feels 
Beijing has responded to improve human rights. 
  In December, GATT finally reached an overall agreement in 
the 
Americas and Europe, bringing to an end the seven-year Uruguay 
round of negotiations. Basically, this assures the continued 
liberalization of trade. The conclusion of the GATT talks is 
naturally advantageous for Hong Kong. This is by no means the 
final talks that will directly benefit Hong Kong, but Hong Kong 
has always stood for free trade, and it benefits from the 
liberalization of trade. Strong protectionist sentiment has 
always existed in international trade. Failure to maintain 
liberalization will mean a slide toward protectionism, and 
protectionism is the thing that Hong Kong least wants to see. 
<H5>  The Stock Market: Foreign Capital Dominates; Great </H5>
Bullishness 
  Foreign Capital Speculation in the Stock Market Not 
Likely To Abate in a Short Time. New Products and New Facilities 
Increase; Market Will Likely Become Hotter. 
  The stock market has always been regarded as a political 
thermometer. However, despite the worsening of the political 
dispute between China and the UK, the Hong Kong stock market 
runs counter to this precept. The more speculation, the more it 
booms. In early 1993, the Heng Seng Index was more than 5000, 
the daily trading volume reaching more than HK$1 billion. Before 
the end of the year, however, the Heng Seng Index broke the 
10,000 points mark, daily trading volume exceeding HK$10 billion. 
  The main reason for this recent bullishness is the entry 
into 
the market of foreign funds, which caused a "three grade jump" 
in the more than 7,000 points Heng Seng Index at the end of 
September. Foreign capitalists do not regard the Sino-British 
political squabble as a matter of any importance. They proclaim 
the good prospects of the China mainland market, and that Hong 
Kong is the best entry way to the China market. The "instigator" 
was the U.S. investment form of Morgan-Stanley, followed by a 
surge of Japanese and European funds. "Intercontinental 
ballistic missiles" struck, and the temperature of the Hong Kong 
market increased greatly. 
  Many people feel that it is unbelievable that speculation 
has 
gone on this way for two or three months, and even old hands 
have been caught flat-footed. The trend during the coming year 
is hard to predict, but the consensus of insiders is that the 
"gold fish bowl" (i.e., the stock market) is a "big crocodile" 
world, meaning the big foreign investors in particular. What 
happens in the market will depend mostly on what foreign 
investors do. 
  One insider said that the logic for the flow between fund 
operators recently is as follows: The market price profit rate 
on the H shares that mainland state-owned business list on the 
Hong Kong market should not be lower that the profit rate on A 
shares (for sale inside China) and the B shares (for sale 
outside China). Furthermore, the market profit rate for the blue 
chip shares of large Hong Kong firms should also not be lower 
than for the H shares. In addition, the market profit rate on 
the Hong Kong stock market (less than 19 times) is lower than in 
very many other places, yet Hong Kong corporations are doing 
well and their profits are high. Thus, the conclusion is that 
Hong Kong share prices should be higher than the current level. 
These insiders figure that during the first quarter of 1994, the 
Heng Seng Index should reach 12,000, meaning 16,000 for the 
whole year. 
  Will the foreign investors withdraw? It seems that they will 
not withdraw for a fairly long time. The first reason is that 
the Chinese mainland economy still seems to be growing at high 
speed. Negative factors during the coming year are few: 
regulation and control have been relaxed recently, and most 
favored nation treatment will likely be extended. One possible 
negative factor is the death of the great helmsman, Deng 
Xiaoping. The second reason is that there is no place for 
foreign investment funds to go. A lot of hot money is available; 
interest rates are low, and the European, American, and Japanese 
economies are in a bad slump. Of course, there is apprehension 
lest foreign capital cause Hong Kong shares to go up, thereby 
bringing Hong Kong investors into the market only to depart once 
they have taken their fill. Actually, money could be withdrawn 
very rapidly, because in addition to stock shares, there are 
other instruments available such as indexed futures and futures 
options that can be used, so selling off and recovering funds is 
extremely easy. Nevertheless, very many small speculators have 
already left the market. Furthermore, not everyone feels that 
political factors can be ignored. In addition, present prices 
are too high. Therefore many people are still very wary. 
  With the advent of a new year, expectations are that the 
Hong 
Kong stock market may become even hotter. This is because of the 
continuing increase in new products and new facilities in the 
stock market. 
  First, the automatic settlement system went into operation, 
every kind of share certificate being fed into the system 
continuously. Following adoption of this system, shares were 
bought and sold using an electronic board listing method, 
inputting into the buying and selling board being done with the 
push of a button for immediate execution of a trade. Trading was 
faster and efficiency increased. 
  Second was approval of short sales of shares. Formerly, 
short 
selling (selling of shares one does not have) was illegal in the 
Hong Kong stock market, but foreign stock markets have long 
approved it. Once the automatic settlement system went into 
operation, selling short was allowed in Hong Kong as of January 
1994. 
  In 1994, options trading will be promoted. Trading of 
indexed 
options already exists. The next step will be buying and selling 
of options for individual shares (mostly blue chip stocks). 
  In addition, more and more China mainland enterprises are 
listing on the Hong Kong exchange. State-owned firms issue H 
shares (currently there are seven or eight of them), and other 
firms come to Hong Kong to shop for empty shells (to buy empty 
shell companies). 
  Inasmuch as more new products and new facilities have been 
introduced, the amount of trading and investment should increase. 
  In addition, since the price of blue chip shares is 
presently 
high, quite a few individual investors deal in H shares and 
second and third line shares. Since the index may rise or fall 
two or three percentage points in a single day, some individual 
investors speculate on the market each day; thus, the volume of 
trading in futures index contracts has increased greatly (to 
more than 10,000 each day). 
<H5>  Real Estate: No Reversal of Rising Trend </H5>
  Prices of buildings are at an all-time high. The rising 
trend will continue unless an upheaval occurs. Luxury apartment 
prices may rise by one-quarter, and medium and small apartment 
prices may rise 15 percent. 
  During the last land sale of 1993, competitive bidding on a 
parcel of land to be used for dwellings in North Kowloon 
resulted in a sale at an all-time high price (more than HK$3.9 
billion, or more than HK$5,400 per square foot of floor space). 
It is estimated that once built, the cost of the premises will 
be 8,000 yuan per square foot). The earliest that buildings can 
be put up on that land will be 1997. Apparently real estate 
dealers view prospects favorably. 
  Is it really true that the real estate market need not take 
political factors into consideration? Chung-yuan Properties 
Agency director, Shih Yung-ch'ing, feels that one cannot say 
that political factors have no effect. When Sino-British talks 
break off for a day or two, the number of inquiries about 
properties decrease, the atmosphere improving only after the 
stock market rises. Of course, big buyers and sellers are not 
much worried about spats between China and the UK in the run up 
to 1997, particularly those who invest in real estate. This is 
because real estate is immovable property. The payback rate will 
extend beyond 1997. During the 1980s, Hong Kong real estate 
gradually went from the hands of those who had no confidence to 
those who had confidence. Most of those who hold real estate 
today are those who feel confident about 1997. Spats between 
China and the UK will not make them unload real property. 
Therefore, it is not political factors that are the main factors 
today, but rather that economic factors favor the real estate 
market. 
  An analysis of the high rise buildings market shows, 
according to Shih Yung-ch'ing, that because the Hong Kong 
economy has grown rapidly, quite a few people on the mainland 
have made money. (This income is not reflected in any economic 
growth statistics.) Their increased wealth has increased the 
demand for luxury dwellings. In addition, some people in 
Mainland China who have become rich first, and some 
"princelings" and entrepreneurs who have come to Hong Kong to 
make money, also want to buy luxury accommodations in Hong Kong. 
The overseas employees of foreign-owned companies also have such 
a need. The supply of luxury accommodations increases by no more 
than 1,000 or so units each year, yet the demand is for 2,000. 
Supply cannot meet demand, so high rise prices rise by at least 
20 percent and as much as 40 percent each year. Today, the price 
rises between HK$5,000 and HK$6,000 per square foot each year. 
  The market price of a medium or small apartment is between 
somewhat more than HK$3,000 and somewhat more than HK$4,000 per 
square foot, depending on location. Because of the effect of 
things such as banks 70 percent collateral requirement, the rate 
of increase during the past year was not great. It averaged 
about 10 percent, which is still higher than the inflation rate. 
  High rise building prices today are at an all-time high. 
Shih 
Yung-ch'ing believes that during the coming year favorable 
factors will outweigh unfavorable factors in the high rise 
building market, including unfavorable political factors. 
Barring a turn to the left on the mainland away from the 
movement toward capitalism that produces a large upheaval, the 
rising trend will not reverse. It is anticipated that prices of 
luxury high rise apartments will rise 25 percent in the coming 
year, and that prices of medium and small apartments will rise 
approximately 15 percent. Also, because land sale prices set an 
all time high at the end of 1993, this will be reflected in the 
future market. 
  Each year more than 30,000 new residential units are 
completed in Hong Kong, but because of the high prices of 
apartments, most people can only look at them and sigh. 
Recently, large numbers of Chinese mainland-owned apartments 
have been sold in Hong Kong, the number reaching 100,000 units 
in slightly more than a year. Shih Yung-ch'ing says that many 
Hong Kong people have purchased apartments on the mainland 
mostly because they cannot afford a Hong Kong apartment, and 
mainland apartment listings account for approximately one-third 
the total for sale in Hong Kong. The effect of mainland 
apartment listings on the Hong Kong apartment market has mostly 
been to soak up savings. Much money has been withdrawn from 
banks, thereby hurting the banks lending ability. This is also 
one of the reasons why Hong Kong banks have tightened their 
collateral requirements. 
<H5>  Sino-Hong Kong Economic Relations and Foreign Trade: </H5>
Development Is the Last Word 
  Future Years To Be Decided by How Mainland Pursues 
Reform and Opening to the Outside World. Continuation of 
Regulation and Control Will Also Not Employ the Methods of 1993 
  As regards economic relations and trade between China and 
Hong Kong, so long as the China mainland continues decontrol, it 
will be possible to apply Deng Xiaoping's descriptive phrase, 
"Development is the last word." 
  The event that had greatest impact during the past year was 
the China mainland's institution of macroeconomic regulation and 
control measures in mid-1993 only to relax them once again at 
the end of the year. The outlook for the next stage of Sino-Hong 
Kong economic relations and trade is that factors for optimism 
will predominate and political factors will not have much 
effect. This is the assessment of Chen Honglin, general manager 
of China's Tianan Investment Corporation. 
  Chen Honglin feels that the mainland's macroeconomic 
regulation and control measures also play a positive role. First 
of all, regulation and control straightens out some ways of 
doing things; it reduces the formerly chaotic situation. Some 
new policies may be tried that can improve the system. Thus, 
operation of the economy may become more normal giving impetus 
to future development. Second, regulation and control is not a 
turning back, nor does it sacrifice speed. The present is a 
period when development is moving ahead. 
  With the recent relaxation of regulation and control, 
various 
indicators appeared. Chen Honglin noted that with a little more 
relaxation, more capital will flow out of the mainland. right 
now, capital in south China is trying to break loose, but is 
being held back. Once relaxation occurs, it will come to Hong 
Kong to buy company names and put them on the stock market, or 
to buy real estate or negotiable securities. Even though the 
amount of money coming to Hong Kong may be limited, it helps 
attract more foreign capital to Hong Kong. Another psychological 
role it plays is that the regulation and control measures of the 
previous stage appeared without warning. No one knew how long 
the retrenchment would last. Not that they have been relaxed, 
even though not greatly, everyone feels there will be no further 
retrenchment. What real changes has relaxation brought? Chen 
Honglin said that trade was rather difficult during the previous 
stage because of the effects of regulation and control. The 
banks tightened the money supply. Deals that had been made could 
not be consummated for lack of money. However, by the end of 
the year, buying and selling increased. This may have been 
because of the relaxation of the money supply, but it may also 
have been because of the desire to use retained foreign 
exchange, or a combination of the two, a final spurt appearing 
at the end of the year. Nevertheless, despite the relaxation, 
there will be no verging on loss of control like previously. The 
relaxation will be focused on the development of bottleneck 
industries such as energy and transportation. 
  Economic relations and trade between China and Hong Kong 
during the coming year will be determined by how the mainland 
pursues reform and opening to the outside world. Chen Honglin 
predicts that the situation in 1994 will be better than in 1993. 
This is because regulation and control has produced initial 
results. Even if regulation and control continues, the methods 
of the lat half of 1993 will not be used. The mainland's 
continuation of reform and opening to the outside world provides 
development room for Hong Kong businessmen. In the trade field, 
the basic stability of the renminbi, in particular, is a 
favorable factor. As for America's extension of most favored 
nation treatment, this is a matter at a different level. In the 
real estate field, too much was attempted during the previous 
period. Projects lacking viability will be eliminated, but a 
development potential exists in large cities such as Guangzhou 
and Shanghai. In the finance and banking field, the mainland 
will introduce a number of international practices, which it is 
hoped will help economic development. Chen Honglin expects that 
pilot projects will be decontrolled to permit the branches of 
foreign owned banks to handle renminbi business. Activities 
inside China and abroad to raise capital (including the issuance 
of stocks and bonds) will also increase under regulation and 
control. Chen Honglin predicts that prospects will be bright for 
finance and banking activity. 
  On the political factors issue, Chen Honglin said the effect 
of political disputes between China and Hong Kong have weakened. 
The political changes that will have the greatest effect are 
still in the China mainland itself, and naturally the event that 
will have the greatest impact is Deng Xiaoping's death. However, 
Chen Honglin believes that the psychological effect of Deng 
Xiaoping's death may be greater than the real effect. This is 
because no turn around of the policy of economic reform and 
opening to the outside world is apparent. The conservatives are 
no longer able to reverse this direction of development. Some 
people speculate that the CPC leadership will have a power 
struggle after Deng dies, and that regional separatism may 
occur. These matters are difficult to estimate, and what effect 
they might have on the economy will depend on whether the 
political situation is stable. In short, unless there is some 
major change in the Chinese mainland political situation, future 
economic prospects should be good, and this should stimulate 
Hong Kong's economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Liu Rixin (0491 2480 2450) of the Economic </F>
Research Center of the State Planning Commission: "Comments on 
Fixed Asset Investment Scale"] 
  [Text] China is now at the juncture of switching to a 
socialist market economy. With regard to its present scale of 
fixed asset investment, different views exist among economic 
theorists and comrades in charge of macroeconomic management. To 
sum up, there are two points at issue: One, is the present scale 
of fixed asset investment too large? Two, under the current 
conditions, how should the state control the investment scale? 
  Following is my personal view on these two questions: 
  First, let us look into the question of whether or not our 
present scale of fixed asset investment is too large. The answer 
depends on the method and standard used in measuring the scale 
of investment. 
  One method is to use the comparable price in comparing the 
current year's investment with the preceding year's. That is, 
the actual investment scale and percentage of increase are 
obtained after the current year's amount of investment is 
adjusted for inflation. Then, the appropriateness of the 
investment scale is determined. This method is upheld by some 
economists, and to apply the method, the State Statistical 
Bureau has compiled a fixed asset investment price index. The 
1993 Statistical Communique pointed out that the country's fixed 
asset investment totaled 1.1829 trillion yuan. Although this 
figure appeared to be 50.6 percent more than the preceding year, 
the communique said, the actual increase was only 22 percent 
after adjustment for inflation, using the fixed asset investment 
price index (23.4 percent) -- this was even less than the 23.7 
percent increase registered in 1992. From this, we cannot 
conclude that our fixed asset investment in 1993 was too large. 
In fact, the 1993 Statistical Communique never said that the 
investment scale that year was too large. It only said that "the 
scale of fixed asset investment projects under construction was 
too large." The investment scale and the scale of investment 
projects under construction are two different things. According 
to the 1993 Statistical Communique, the state-owned units' fixed 
asset investment projects under construction totaled 2.327 
trillion yuan. After deducting the projects completed that year, 
the unfinished work at the end of that year was in the amount of 
1.32 trillion yuan. Based on the fact that fixed investment 
projects costing 832.1 billion yuan [figure as published] were 
completed by state-owned units that year, the above-mentioned 
unfinished work would take only one year and seven months to 
complete. This was a marked advance, compared with the situation 
existing several years ago when it would take two to three years 
or even a longer period to complete the unfinished investment 
projects. Viewed in this way, even the scale of the investment 
projects under construction was not too large as of the end of 
1993. 
  Another method is to compare the investment with GDP, using 
the current prices. This gives the ratio of fixed asset 
investment to GDP. Thus, by looking at the investment amount in 
relation to the country's economic strength, we can find out 
whether our investment scale is commensurate with our national 
power. 
  Based on statistical data, the investment-to-GDP ratios for 
the last three years are listed below:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  In 1993, the ratio of total fixed asset investment to GDP 
was 
37.7 percent, and that of state-owned units' fixed asset 
investment to GDP was 26.5 percent. This, I think, is indicative 
of an overly large scale of investment for the following reasons: 
  First, judging from our experience with respect to the 
investment-to-GDP ratio, we have now gone beyond the rational 
limit. 
  Practical experience over the past 15 years since the start 
of reform and opening-up shows that when the ratio of total 
fixed asset investment to GDP exceeds 30 percent and the ratio 
of state-owned units' fixed asset investment to GDP exceeds 20 
percent, the relations between the various sectors of our 
national economy would be strained and even become imbalanced. 
The present strained relations between the various economic 
sectors are due to this reason. 
  Second, the actual investment in 1993 greatly exceeded 
the target. 
  According to the 1993 plan adopted by the First Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress, the nation's total fixed 
asset investment was 800 billion yuan, and the investment rate 
should be no more than 30 percent. Of the total investment, the 
portion made by state-owned units was set at 565 billion yuan 
and that by collectively owned units and individuals 235 billion 
yuan. However, the actual total investment was 382.9 billion 
yuan more than the planned figure, or an overage of 47.9 
percent. The state-owned units' actual investment was 267.1 
billion yuan, or 47.3 percent, more than the plan, while the 
actual investment by collectives and individuals showed an 
average of 115.8 billion yuan, or 49.3 percent. The investment 
rate -- which was limited to 30 percent in the 1993 plan -- 
refers to the proportion of total fixed asset investment to 
national income. According to statistical data, the investment 
rate for 1992 was 39.5 percent. The rate for 1993 is estimated 
at about 42 percent, even outstripping the record registered for 
the "Great Leap Forward" period. This was a matter of rare 
occurrence since the founding of the People's Republic. 
  Third, never before had so much currency been put 
into circulation--an indication of the overly large scale of 
investment. 
  Calculated at the current price level, the 1993 GDP 
increased 30.6 percent, while the nation's total investment in 
fixed assets rose 50.6 percent. This was the chief reason for 
the soaring demand for currency. The following shows the sharp 
increase in the amount of currency put into circulation as a 
result of the rapid expansion of investment: In 1992, 115.8 
billion yuan of currency was put into circulation. In 1993, the 
amount put into circulation soared to 152.9 billion yuan, 
hitting a record high. This was even more than the total for the 
last five years of the 1980's (115.3 billion for 1985-1989). By 
the end of 1993, the amount of currency in circulation reached 
586.5 billion yuan. Compared with the preceding year, the 
increase was 35.3 percent. This was another big hike following 
the 36.5 percent increase registered in 1992. It was also 
another peak in the last few decades only next to the 1988 
record (which had a 46.7 percent increase). 
  Fourth, the extent of inflation was also indicative of 
the overly large scale of investment. 
  The increase in currency necessitated by the swelling 
investment has resulted in rising commodity prices. In 1993 the 
price index for the people's daily necessities (covering prices 
for both commodities and services, equivalent to the consumer 
price index in the West) rose 14.7 percent, following the 6.4 
percent hike registered in 1992. The retail price index rose 5.4 
percent in 1992 and climbed further by 13 percent in 1993. Last 
year the inflation rate reached two digits, being the fourth 
such occurrence in the 40-plus years since the founding of the 
People's Republic. This is a matter deserving serious attention. 
As there is a time gap between a large supply of currency and 
the appearance of its effect on commodity prices, the large 
amount of currency put into circulation in 1993 is expected to 
drive up the prices in 1994. Such being the case, we will still 
have a serious inflation problem this year. 
  Fifth, our country's investment scale is larger than 
that of foreign countries (regions). 
  Now, in developed countries, the ratio of fixed asset 
investment to GDP is generally about 15-20 percent. Japan has 
the highest ratio, which is around 30 percent. This 
investment-to-GDP ratio is related to the stage of economic 
development. Among the newly emerging industrial countries 
(regions), let's take the Republic of Korea as an example. In 
the 1970's when its economy was taking off, the highest 
investment-to-GDP ratio was only about 33 percent. At that time, 
Taiwan Province had a ratio of about 28 percent (in 1992, it was 
22.8 percent). 
  How should the state control the investment scale at 
present? This is a major question concerning macroeconomic 
regulation and control under the new circumstances, which has 
not been satisfactorily resolved. 
  Some people say that at this time the state should not, and 
cannot, control the scale of investment. In my opinion, however, 
control is necessary. Due to a lack of sufficient studies on the 
concrete measures to be taken, here I can only offer some 
guideline suggestions: 
  First, we should establish a clear-cut principle based 
on which the state makes guidance plans as to the scale of 
investment under the market economic system. 
  We may follow the experience of Western market-economy 
countries (regions). That is, we may include in the state plan 
an absolute amount of total investment (including the amount of 
fixed asset investment and the increase in working funds) and a 
total investment ratio, which is the proportion of total 
investment (fixed asset investment and increase in working 
funds) to GDP. This will bring the investment scale more or less 
into line with our national strength. This is a reform of the 
state plan. To do so, the statistical department should first 
work out the pertinent investment ratios for the basic period to 
be used in planning. 
  Second, the state should formulate a more specific 
industrial policy to guide investment. 
  The industrial policy should be carried out in every 
locality. Certain economic levers should be adjusted to 
accommodate the implementation of the industrial policy and 
facilitate the fulfillment of the country's investment plan. 
  Third, the central bank should beef up control over 
loans for fixed asset investment. 
  The central bank should strictly carry out the state budget 
concerning loans for fixed asset investment. This budget, 
included in both the state investment plan and the bank's credit 
plan, must be strictly adhered to; no one is allowed to overrun 
it. No financial institutes should arbitrarily extend loans for 
fixed asset investment. Without proper approval, no locality and 
department should issue bonds, experiment with the shareholding 
system, or raise funds to finance construction projects. 
Projects using foreign capital must be carried out in accordance 
with the state plan. As for projects built with direct foreign 
investment, it is imperative to strengthen their guidance and 
subject them to a standard control procedure. 
  Fourth, different investment-control methods should be 
used for different investors. 
  In fact, our present macro-control over investment is still 
concentrated on state-owned units. It has not touched the 
investment made by the large variety of new economic sectors 
that have emerged since the start of reform and opening-up, such 
as the privately and individually owned economic sectors, 
township enterprises, Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign 
cooperative enterprises, wholly-foreign-funded enterprises, as 
well as joint enterprises owned by the state and collectives, 
state and individuals, and collectives and individuals. In 
reforming our economic management system, we should shift our 
main attention to these new economic sectors so as to truly 
reinforce macro-control over investment.

prepared by the Price Research Institute's Situation Analysis 
Group headed by Chen Dezun (7115 1795 1415) and written by Cao 
Jianjun (2580 1696 6511) et al] 
  [Text] I. 1993's Economic Development and Price 
Situation 
  China's economic construction achieved outstanding results 
in 
1993. The GNP rose 13 percent; per capital GNP increased by more 
than 2,500 yuan over the previous year. It is estimated that 
agricultural value has risen by 3.7 percent based on constant 
prices, with grain production topping 456.4 billion kilo and oil 
production topping 17.61 million tons. Industrial value 
increased by 19.5 percent based on constant prices. The people's 
income also increased: After taking the price factor into 
consideration, it is estimated that per capital cost-of-living 
income for people in cities and towns rose 10 percent last year; 
the rural population's per capita net income rose around 2 
percent. People's newly added savings broke through the 300 
billion-yuan mark. The markets were very active. It is estimated 
that after taking inflation into consideration, social retail 
sales actually rose 9 percent over the previous year. 1993's 
total import and export topped $190 billion, approximately a 15 
percent increase compared to 1992. 
  Despite the above-described fine situation, China's economy 
was still plagued by many problems. The pre-existing and the new 
problems together caused the overall price level to rise 
sharply, and this will have a significant effect on the economy 
in 1994. In 1993, the nation's total retail price index rose 13 
percent over the previous year's. The price increases covered a 
broad spectrum of commodities; almost all major consumer 
products, labor and services, and factors of production were 
affected. After mid-July, the macro regulation and control 
measures adopted by the central authorities began to take 
effect, and overall price level and the prices of some factors 
of production leveled off some. But after November, inflation 
picked up momentum again. The price situation was even worse in 
the fourth quarter. The consumer price indexes in the large- and 
medium-sized cities soared; the low-income class and college and 
high school students had strong reactions. The prices of 
agricultural means of production were rising faster than 
agricultural product prices, and agricultural trade conditions 
were unfavorable. Despite the comprehensive price increase, 
however, the prices of energy, rail transport, and a handful of 
capital goods and infrastructure remained fairly low. 
  The main causes of the above situation are: 
  1. The slow-developing basic industry has not kept up 
with economic development. 
  Development of the basic industry, energy, transportations 
and communications and similar sectors has remained slow. The 
situation has not changed in 1993. Year-end statistics showed 
that rail transport capacity has increased only 3 percent 
compared to the previous year. Basically no new trunk-line was 
put into service the whole year. Last year was one of the worse 
years for rail transport in recent history. The power department 
has estimated that currently China has a power supply shortfall 
of around 20 percent. The Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area has a 8 
billion kw shortfall; the northeast region has a 3-5 billion kw 
shortfall; east China has always had a power shortage problem. 
Based on actual needs, our elasticity of demand for power is 
greater than 1.2, but the actual average is only 0.95. Coal 
supply and demand are more or less balanced, but because of 
transport capacity, supply is still tight in the economically 
well-developed east and south China. The supply of steel 
materials barely meets demand even with enterprises working 
beyond capacity and with massive imports. Rapid economic growth 
has resulted in a strong demand for basic goods and 
infrastructure, which directly causes prices in the basic goods 
markets to soar and in turn causes the overall product price 
level to rise as a result of higher production cost. 
  2. Imperfect market organization and clogged channels 
fail to link supply to demand despite ample supply. 
  Due to the slow relay of information, monopoly, regional 
separatism, and failure to organize supply in a timely fashion, 
product circulation in China has often failed to link supply to 
demand. For example, in late November 1993, soaring grain price 
was first spotted in Guangdong. It then spread to Hubei, Hunan, 
Anhui, Jiangxi and so on, and before long, it reached the north, 
resulting in grain price fluctuations over a fairly wide area. 
Actually, we did not have a grain shortage in 1993; we also had 
an ample reserve, but because grain management departments were 
cut in some localities, grain transfer and shipment was slow, 
making it too late to remedy the shortfall in some grain markets. 
  3. Behind the active markets is the hidden concern for 
inadequate market demand. 
  The economy has been growing rapidly and prices have been 
soaring, which seem to indicate brisk demands and a lively 
market, but market demands for some products have been flat. For 
example, the market for household electrical appliances is 
already saturated; textile goods have long been in a slump; 
cement stockpile has grown to around 21 million tons, and 
stockpiles in the large- and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises have continued to grow. It is estimated that the 
stockpile of finished goods at year-end may be 12 percent larger 
than 1992's. In the rural markets in particular, because the 
increase in the peasants' income has slowed recently, sales of 
agricultural means of production has also been sluggish, and 
sales of industrial goods in the rural areas has not yet 
recovered, and in view of the increasing scope of industrial 
production, these have become a potential concern. 
  4. Despite the excess currency in circulation, there 
are still some settlement problems. 
  Since 1992 and for two years in a row, currency in 
circulation has been increasing at a rate of nearly 40 percent. 
During the same period, the national economy was growing at 27 
percent while prices were increasing at 19 percent--the rate of 
increase in currency in circulation almost doubled these rates. 
Despite that, settlement remained a problem in many sectors; 
enterprises' triangle of debts continued to grow. Too much 
currency in circulation seriously threatens to further drive up 
prices, but settlement problems continue to call for more money 
input. 
<H5>  II. Forecast and Analysis of Price Situation in the First </H5>
Half of 1994 
  Judging by 1993's economic situation and 1994's plans for 
economic development and reform, it is expected that we will 
continue to experience a high rate of economic growth 
accompanied by high rate of inflation in the first half of 1994. 
The inflation rate will keep pace with the rate of economic 
growth and may exceed 10 percent or even higher. The causes of 
the high rate of increase in prices are: 
  1. The "rooster-tail" effect of higher prices in 
1993: 
  In 1993, while the economy sustained a 13 percent growth 
rate, the cost-of-living index in cities and towns was 15 
percent, and in the 35 large- and medium-sized cities, it 
actually exceeded 20 percent. It is expected that last year's 
price increases will continue to have an effect this year, 
accounting for 4-5 percentage points of this year's retail price 
increase. 
  2. Massive currency input has generated strong 
inflationary pressure. 
  The macro regulation and control measures taken after July 
curbed the loss of control over currency input that had begun in 
the first half of 1993, but there was still too much money in 
circulation. There was substantial currency input in the second 
half of last year, and at year-end, various specialized banks 
had approximately 180 billion yuan in basic currency. Today, the 
banks have twice as much reserve fund as they had last July; it 
has created a huge amount of high-energy money. At year-end, 
currency in circulation may nearly quadruple that at the end of 
last year. The state banks' plans for new loans in 1994 are 
based on a fairly high rate of economic growth of 9 percent; 
total loan volume will be 470 billion yuan, a 17.8 percent 
increase. Thus, the money supply which is ready to explode will 
have tremendous pressure on market prices. 
  3. The huge investment scope and unbalanced industrial 
structure will continue to be the main driving force behind the 
price increases. 
  Although the total scope of fixed asset investment declined 
after the "macro regulation and control" efforts, it continued 
to increase at a rate of more than 46 percent in 1993. It is 
estimated that the state-owned units will have about 1.44 
trillion yuan's work carried over from last year, 40 percent 
more than in the previous year. This year, in order to ease the 
restriction in the "bottleneck" industries, the start-up rate of 
new key projects will continue to increase substantially. Adding 
the state's matching investments in foreign capital utilization, 
this year's planned social fixed asset investment scope will be 
1.3 trillion yuan, 13 percent more than last year's, and it is 
more than likely that we will exceed that amount. Accompanying 
this huge investment scope is the unbalanced industrial 
structure, especially the weak basic industry, which limits the 
increase in energy and raw materials supply, creating a large 
supply shortfall. Thus, it can only push the price level higher 
and cause a chain-reaction. 
  4. The potential effects of the restructuring of the 
economic system and price reform. 
  Several economic reform measures will be introduced this 
year. Those that have potential effects on the overall price 
level include exchange rate reform, tax reform, and the 
structural readjustment of prices. The merging of the exchange 
rate tracks will make it easier for domestic enterprises to 
obtain foreign exchange, and so we may find even more imports 
this year, and enterprise production cost will also increase as 
a result. Tax reform overall will not increase enterprises' 
burden, but because of the change in the tax structure, 
individual enterprise tax burden will necessarily change. The 
value-added tax will increase wholesale enterprises' tax burden; 
retail enterprises' taxes will go down. In addition, grain, 
chemical fertilizers, pesticides, live hogs, and reprocessed 
resources and other previously tax-exempt businesses will be 
paying a value-added tax this year. The structural adjustment of 
prices will primarily affect grain, crude oil, and rail 
transport prices, but no doubt, it will directly push market 
prices higher. 
  5. The structural change in workers' income and 
people's consumption will also raise the consumer price 
index. 
  In recent years, the income level has risen significantly. 
Statistics showed that from January to November 1993, the 
nation's total wage bill rose 21.8 percent compared to the same 
period a year ago. Specifically, wages in the people-owned units 
rose 21.9 percent; city and town collective economic units, 15.1 
percent; other economic units, 73.5 percent, which set a 
historical record. The workers' nonwage income has also reached 
substantial amounts. The rise in labor cost has become another 
important factor pushing up production cost and product prices. 
Even more serious is the change in income distribution. A 
typical survey showed that currently, 2 percent of the 
population is accounting for 30 percent of the income. 
Meanwhile, the consumer market is also becoming more 
luxury-goods-oriented. A 2,000-yuan leather coat is no longer a 
novelty. The demand for soap and cosmetics has shifted to more 
expensive kinds that are either imported or produced by 
joint-venture enterprises. Motor cycles, air conditioners, video 
tapes, camcorders, computers, hi-fi, multi-function TV sets, 
refrigerators, telephones, and telecommunications equipment are 
already or will soon become hot-sellers. This kind of 
conspicuous consumption has a strong enticing or exemplary 
effect on the low-to-middle income people. Therefore, even 
though total demand in the consumer goods markets will not 
change dramatically, the change in income distribution and the 
structure of the products market will still push the prices of 
consumer goods higher. 
  6. The imperfect market construction and market 
organization cause sudden market and price fluctuations for some 
products. 
  China's various tangible markets are small-scaled; supply 
and 
demand are scattered. The supply and marketing channels are 
disjointed for many important products, and regional blocks and 
market monopoly are fairly serious problems. Therefore, even for 
goods whose supply and demand are balanced, because of changes 
in certain policies or people's expectations, there can still be 
market and price fluctuations. If these fluctuations become 
frequent occurrences, there will be a natural tendency for 
prices to rise. 
<H5>  III. An Analysis of 1994's Price Trend and Some Policy </H5>
Suggestions 
  Looking over China's current economic situation and the 
reform and development, it is inevitable that we will find price 
increases of significant magnitudes in 1994. Judging by the 
developmental trend, we may encounter one of the following two 
situations in the second half of the year: A) Given the in-depth 
restructuring of the economic system and the stepped-up macro 
regulation and control, abnormal price fluctuations and price 
increases are put under effective control; the rise in the 
overall price level will keep pace with the fairly high rate of 
economic growth. B) The economy will grow at high speed and 
inflation will be in double-digits, forcing a readjustment of 
the national economy. The result will be slower economic growth, 
but because various factors contributing to the higher prices 
are not eliminated, the price level will continue to rise, 
creating a situation of slow growth accompanied by high 
inflation. In the former situation, the price situation will be 
grim, but under the latter situation, it will be horrible. 
  To avoid even worse inflation, we must include controlling 
the price level in our macro policy objective. We suggest 
adopting the following policies or reform measures: 
  1. Keep the increase in the money supply steady. 
  The state's monetary policy must strive to stabilize the 
money supply. Considering the fact that there is already excess 
supply of currency in circulation, we must control the increase 
in currency issuance to within the sum total of the planned 
price increase and economic growth; the maximum rate should not 
exceed last year's rate of increase. 
  2. Keep the increase in investment demands under tight 
control. 
  To control investment demand, ultimately we must turn to the 
restructuring of the investment system and other economic 
systems. Currently, while reform is not fully in place, we must 
still rely on administrative regulation and control. Primarily, 
we must adopt different financial and taxation policies when 
dealing with investments of different types. That is, for highly 
profitable and competitive investments, we should turn to 
higher-interest, commercial loans and impose a higher tax rate. 
For less profitable capital investments which take a longer 
time to generate profit, we should adopt a low-interest policy 
and commercial loans and reduce the tax burden accordingly. For 
low- or even no-profit public-good-type investments, the state 
not only must allocate special low-interest loans but should 
formulate policies to encourage society at large to make 
investments. In addition, the state should also take local 
development into consideration and guide and adjust the 
investment scopes in various industries in different regions. 
  3. Set up and perfect macro regulation and control and 
indirect market regulation measures. 
  To prevent abnormal fluctuations of great magnitudes in the 
commodities market, the state should set up some agricultural 
and sideline product and industrial capital goods wholesale 
markets in the goods and materials gathering and distribution 
areas and the large and medium-sized cities. Thereupon, it 
should target the products' different characteristics and adopt 
different macro regulation and control and indirect regulation 
measures. A) For low demand-elasticity products, such as grains, 
cotton, sugar, salt, pesticides, and groundcove, we should adopt 
a regulation and control policy whose objective is to "guarantee 
supply." The state must resolutely set up a system of stockpile 
of important products in various localities over a period of 
time and in groups and diligently set up a special regulation 
fund and link the management of those products to stable market 
supply. For example, it should be stipulated that managers must 
keep a standard-size stock on hand. That is, they must maintain 
the government-regulated maximum or minimum stock on hand and 
operate as directed by the government at times of market 
fluctuations. B) For industrial consumer goods with high 
elasticity of demand, we should emphasize the construction and 
standardization of wholesale markets, and as much as possible, 
adopt economic measures to curb price fluctuations and, if 
necessary, resume the price increase application filing system. 
C) For industrial capital goods market which governs the trend 
of market demand, while we keep up the necessary macro planning 
and regulation, we should regularly make small adjustment 
through monetary, financial, taxation, and other macroeconomic 
policies. 
  4. Vigorously open up the rural markets. 
  To open up rural markets, besides guiding enterprises to 
produce goods that sell well in the rural areas, the most 
important thing is to increase the peasants' income. On the one 
hand, we must set protective, supportive prices for agricultural 
products; and on the other hand, we must continue to encourage 
and support the development of township enterprises, and 
accelerate the shift of the surplus rural labor force. At the 
same time, agricultural investments must be given comprehensive 
preferential treatment through government policies. 
  5. Open up a variety of investment channels, guide the 
people in increasing savings and diversifying their investments, 
and dissipate the market pressure on hot-selling consumer 
goods. 
  The most important thing today is to create conditions to 
facilitate the people's financial and real estate investments. 
The financial investment sector should be opened up more to the 
public to turn consumption funds into production funds. Reform 
of the real estate system should aim to help the people achieve 
the goal of owning their own homes.

<F P=106> [Report on Wang Zhiyuan (3769 5268 6678): "State Assets </F>
Being Lost Through Multiple Channels"] 
  [Text] Editor's note: The loss of state assets 
has caused widespread concern among members of the public, but 
few people know how the losses occur. This is why we are 
printing an investigation report on the loss of state assets 
written by Comrade Wang Zhiyuan of the scientific research 
office of the State Administration of State Properties. This 
report is a clear description of the channels and ways through 
which state assets are lost in Sino-foreign joint ventures and 
transformed shareholding enterprises, when administrative units 
set up the three kinds of wholly or partially foreign-funded 
enterprises, and when collective enterprises modify property 
rights. It is a good piece of reference material and should be 
read carefully. [end editors note] 
<H5>  Loss of State Assets in Sino-Foreign Joint Ventures and </H5>
Contractual Joint Ventures 
  Because of China's growing international reputation and the 
liberalization of the investment climate at home, foreign 
investment in China has been booming and the number of 
Sino-foreign joint ventures has increased sharply. This has been 
a great boost to economic development in China across the board 
and has helped raise the standards of production technology and 
management. However, state assets are being lost and their 
legitimate rights and interests are encroached upon severely by 
the way some localities go about setting up joint ventures with 
foreign firms. 
  Assets of Chinese Partners Not Appraised 
  To set up a Sino-foreign joint venture, the first thing that 
should be done is to have the assets of both parties appraised. 
Only then can one clarify their responsibilities, rights, and 
interests. There should have been no question about this. 
Nevertheless, owing to a variety of reasons -- the lack of 
comprehensive laws in this field, government intervention, and 
assets appraisal poorly done, sloppy appraisal -- the failure to 
performam an assets appraisal has been a widespread phenomenon 
in Sino-foreign joint ventures for many years. According to 
incomplete data, about 90 percent of Chinese assets in 
Sino-foreign joint ventures each year should be but are not 
appraised. In 1992, of all Sino-foreign joint ventures approved 
by foreign economic relations and trade agencies, about 10,000 
involved state enterprises on the Chinese side, And of these 
10,000, 2,900 had their assets appraised. On average, appraised 
value is 75 percent higher than net book value. Thus over 6,000 
state enterprises entered into a joint venture with a foreign 
company without having their assets appraised. Their combined 
investment in the joint ventures was 86.264 billion yuan. With a 
value increase rate of 75 percent, we figure out that the 
absence of assets appraisal caused a loss of state assets to the 
tune of 64.698 billion yuan. 
  Assets of Two Parties Not Priced Fairly 
  It is a common practice among the Chinese entering into 
joint 
ventures with foreign businessmen to undervalue their assets. 
For example, a steel pipe factory proposed using state assets 
with a book value of 50 million yuan to set up a joint venture 
with a foreign investor. Notified of this situation and acting 
in accordance with the pertinent regulations, the local state 
properties bureau proceeded to re-appraise the state assets of 
the steel pipe factory based on current prices. The assets were 
re-appraised at 210,000,000 yuan. The leaders of the enterprise 
argued that the assets were over-valued and refused to accept 
the figure. After intervention by the local leader, the state 
assets bureau did another appraisal which lowered the value to 
185,000,000 yuan, a number still considered too high by both the 
local and the enterprise leaders. In the end, an administrative 
decision was imposed under which the enterprise was to enter 
into the joint venture with the state assets valued at 50 
million yuan. 
  Investment by both Chinese and foreign partners in joint 
ventures typically takes the form of goods and materials, and 
overvalued ones at that. There is a chemical industrial firm in 
Xiangtan Shi, a Sino-foreign joint venture. The foreign partner 
claimed a value of $1.2 million for its equipment, while the 
actual value was just $900,000, thus overvaluing it by $300,000. 
It also claimed that its software was valued at $300,000, while 
the real worth was only $30,000. 
  The practices among Chinese partners of undervaluing Chinese 
state assets and accepting the inflated values of the foreign 
partners' equipment and technology seriously damage the 
legitimate rights and interests of the state. Under the 
"Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Law," net profit shall be 
distributed among the partners in accordance with their 
respective shares of registered capital. Undervaluing the 
Chinese partner's state assets thus inevitably lowers its share 
of the total capital and hence its claim to the return on state 
assets as well as other rights. 
<H5>  Through "Transfer Pricing," Foreign Companies Encroach Upon </H5>
China's State Assets, Evade Paying Taxes to Chinese Government 
  "Transfer prices refer to the prices multinationals charge 
for goods and services sold inside China. They are also called 
allocated prices. These prices are not subject to the usual 
supply-demand relations on the market and represent a means 
through which multinationals can maximize their profits." 
"Transfer pricing" is an artificial pricing method intended to 
shift an enterprise's profits. On the one hand, the enterprise 
achieves its purpose of tax evasion. On the other hand, this 
pricing method encroaches upon the Chinese partner's state 
assets in a big way. The upshot is an anomaly: an enterprise may 
suffer a loss on paper but is really raking in a profit. 
Popularly dubbed "zero profit," this is actually a ruse resorted 
to by foreign companies to turn a real profit into a sham loss. 
  Many of the foreign investors in China are multinational 
corporations or their subsidiaries. They use a whole bunch of 
imaginative "transfer pricing" tactics, most of them in the 
following areas: 
  Buying and Selling of Goods 
  A foreign investor may move profits around by "importing 
high 
and exporting low." (This is how it works. It imports raw 
materials from overseas, paying a relatively low world market 
price, and then sells the raw materials to the joint venture at 
a higher price. When it comes to selling the output, it obtains 
the goods from the joint venture at a fairly low price and sells 
them on the international market at a higher price.) 
Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures and wholly 
foreign-funded enterprises, where foreign businessmen exercise 
managerial power, work hand in hand with affiliated companies 
overseas to buy and sell raw materials and products based on 
internal prices, creating a "sham loss" or "a tiny profit" and 
achieving their objectives of encroaching upon the profits and 
eliminating or minimizing their tax liabilities. Take, for 
instance, the case of a Japanese electrical machinery company in 
Shenzhen, a wholly Japanese-owned enterprise which sells the 
bulk of its output to its affiliated company in Hong Kong. For 2 
years after it opened for business, which coincided with its 
income tax exemption period, it made a small fit. Beginning in 
1986, it has been losing money year after year on its exports, 
with losses exceeding 15 million yuan in all, close to 10 
percent. An investigation revealed that there were two different 
sets of sale prices for the enterprise's products. The prices it 
charged its non-affiliated enterprises were 20 to 46 percent 
higher than those it charged its affiliated company. Foreign 
companies which have set up Sino-foreign contractual joint 
ventures mostly make money through their control over the sales 
channels as a buyer of raw materials and agent for the sale of 
products. 
  Charging Fees for Services Within the Group 
  A foreign businessman may jack up the enterprise's costs and 
corner its profits by overpaying its affiliated company overseas 
for services the latter has rendered or undercharging the latter 
for services the former has performed. Take, for instance, a 
foreign-funded enterprise whose main business was petroleum gas. 
For 10 years after it opened for business, it reported a loss 
each year. Yet it never charged its Hong Kong affiliate for 
storage and transhipment services it had rendered. In 1990 the 
tax department ruled that it should charge for services at the 
rate of 10 percent, the going rate, and proceeded to look into 
its losses and profits. In the 1988-1989 period alone it should 
have collected $2.28 million [Hong Kong dollars] in service 
charges. Based on these figures, the company actually earned a 
$478,000 profit instead of losing money. Its retroactive income 
tax liability: HK$71,000. 
  Lending 
  When the foreign partner makes a loan to a joint venture, it 
raises interest rates and thus siphons off the profit. One 
example involves a Sino-foreign joint venture. In 1985 it was 
strapped for working capital, so the foreign partner secured a 
loan from a foreign bank. Between 1985 and 1988 it took out 
loans totalling 37.96 million yuan and paid 5.14 million yuan in 
interest at interest rates ranging from a high of 21.25 percent 
to a low of 15.25 percent, 50 percent to 100 percent higher than 
what banks charge their borrowers on the international market. 
  Transfer of Invisible Assets 
  The foreign partner influences the margin of profit of an 
enterprise by manipulating the values of invisible assets. There 
was a Sino-foreign joint venture. The Chinese partner invested 
$8 million in it; the foreign partner, a mere $1.5 million. The 
foreign partner's parent company was put in charge of importing 
patented equipment and technology transfer, for which it charged 
$6 million. Informed sources put the foreign partner's margin of 
profit between 30 to 40 percent. Assuming that it was 35 
percent, the foreign company's profit already topped its 
registered capital. That way the investor made a fortune by 
inflating transfer prices even before the joint venture opened 
its door for business and sowed the seeds of future losses for 
the company. 
  Through transfer pricing, foreign investors achieve their 
goal of shifting profits overseas while condemning th 
enterprises to a prolonged state of unprofitability and red ink 
and causing colossal losses for China. 
<H5>  The Loss Of State Assets as a Result of Transformation of </H5>
Enterprises Into Shareholding Enterprises Or Companies 
  In the course of converting enterprises into shareholding 
enterprises or companies, the failure to appraise state assets, 
the undervaluing of state shares, the failure to match state 
shares with other shares, the failure to issue dividends to 
state shares, the issue of a minimal amount of dividends to 
state shares, the conversion of state shares into legal-person 
shares and personal shares, so on and so forth, have all 
resulted in the loss of state assets. These are the principal 
ways in which enterprise transformation via the shareholding 
route may cause the loss of state assets: 
  As part of its experiment with the shareholding system, an 
enterprise creates "enterprise shares." Some enterprises create 
"internal employee shares" which employees may acquire 
gratuitously or at a reduced price. 
  In the five shareholding enterprises set up in Jilin after 
1985, for instance, "enterprise shares" accounted for 45.5 
percent of the total value of all shares issued. In addition, 20 
percent of the "enterprise shares" were set aside and turned 
into 2,843 shares at 200 yuan each. They were distributed among 
the employees based on the number of employees each enterprise 
had and their seniority. Employees were also allowed to collect 
dividends. 
<H5>  In the Course of Converting an Enterprise Into a </H5>
Shareholding Enterprise, State Assets Are Not Converted Into 
Shares Based on Replacement Costs But At Low Prices. 
  Regulations require the conversion of state assets into 
shares based on net asset replacement value. In reality, state 
assets have been converted into shares according to original 
book value in the vast majority of cases. There were six 
enterprises in Shanghai whose assets had a combined original 
book value of 827 million yuan. An appraisal put their net 
assets replacement value at 1.688 billion yuan. In the end, the 
assets were converted into shares based on the original book 
value of 827 million yuan. In Chengdu, an appraisal raised the 
value of the assets of state enterprises adopting the 
shareholding system by 29 percent, significantly lower than the 
rate at which assets in that city had been appreciating (70 
percent) as well as the national average. (Between 1989 and 
1992, the average assets appreciation rate nationwide was 54 
percent.) 
<H5>  When It Comes to the Distribution of Dividends, State Shares </H5>
and Personal Shares Are Treated Differently. 
  The problem of jacking up dividends on personal shares and 
holding down dividends on state shares is widespread among most 
of the enterprises in Chengdu in Sichuan Province and Wuhan. 
This is how dividends were divided up each year by a 
shareholding limited-liability company in Wuhan between 1988 and 
1992: For state shares, the dividend rate was 11.5 to 13.7 
percent; social personal shares, between 17 and 17.5 percent; 
and employee personal shares, 20 percent. A shareholding 
enterprise in Sichuan followed an even more inequitable 
practice. In calculating the dividend for personal shares, it 
added the income tax payable to the profit to be distributed and 
divided up the amount among the number of personal shareholders. 
In contrast, the after-tax profit was used in figuring out the 
state share dividend. In effect, the income tax liability was 
borne solely by the state, not all shareholders. In 1992 the 
enterprise gave out personal share dividends at the rate of 29 
percent while the rate for state shares was a little over 3 
percent. 
<H5>  Enterprises Price Shares Differently, Encroaching Upon the </H5>
Profits of the State-Enterprise Legal Person. 
  When it first started issuing shares, a building in Chengdu 
priced personal shares and legal personal shares at 1.15 yuan 
and 3.5 yuan each, respectively. The problem has now been 
ratified. 
  Some State Assets Not Being Converted Into Shares 
  According to regulations, when a state enterprise is 
converted into a shareholding enterprise, all its original 
assets should be put into production. In pilot projects now 
under way, the original assets, particularly non-operational 
assets, have not been put into production in a large number of 
enterprises that had adopted the shareholding system on an 
experimental basis. One company in Tianjin, for instance, failed 
to include 176 million yuan in state assets. Most commonly, land 
use rights and other invisible assets are excluded. According to 
a study on shareholding enterprises in Nanning and Wuzhou in 
Guangxi Province, all 11 directional fund-raising shareholding 
companies in the two cities failed to convert land into shares, 
instead allowing the land to be used free of charge. 
  Enterprise Mismanagement Causes Loss of State Assets 
  State enterprises losing money. This is the biggest problem 
facing China's state economy. Xiangtan Shi is one of the 
industrially advanced areas in Hunan. The city's 79 state 
enterprises within the budget had 3.434 billion yuan in combined 
assets and 2.720 billion yuan in liabilities, which amounted to 
79.5 percent of the former. Mismanagement-related losses 
represent a particularly serious problem in former military 
enterprises now converted to civilian production. These 
enterprises have little funds at their own disposal and meager 
self-development capability. As a result, much of their fixed 
assets sit idle while they suffer extensive management-related 
losses. A munitions factory in Hubei, for instance, had 7.16 
million yuan in losses at the end of 1992. 
  Collective Enterprises Losing State Assets 
  It is a common phenomenon for collective enterprises to use 
state assets gratuitously, even selling them off without 
authorization. Hence the massive losses of state assets in 
collective enterprises. Collective enterprises lose state assets 
mainly in these ways: 
  Selling Off Equipment Without Permission 
  Some enterprises take up and use the state assets of 
enterprises owned by the whole people without paying for them. 
Because of mismanagement, they turn out high-priced but 
poor-quality products and suffer extensive losses. To ease their 
financial plight, these enterprises take it upon themselves to 
sell off without authorization the machinery and equipment they 
have been using. Regulations require them to use the income 
derived from such sales to modernize and transform fixed assets. 
Instead, many enterprises have used the income to cover losses 
in their current account or give it out as wages, thus covertly 
divvying up state assets. 
  Enterprises do a poor job in taking care of state assets. 
What exists on the books and what they actually have in hand may 
be two different things. Both cause state assets to be lost in 
large quantities. 
  The way some collective enterprises manage the fixed state 
assets in their use, including their changes, installation, use, 
and upkeep and maintenance is utterly chaotic. Equipment is 
discarded or lost but the books are not updated, so there is no 
consistency between the two. This is a serious and widespread 
problem. 
  Fixed Assests Under Compensated 
  When a collective enterprise uses state fixed assets, it 
should take depreciation on them. In fact, many enterprises fail 
to do so and the amount involved is huge. Fixed assets are 
woefully underpaid. Moreover, the depreciation taken, instead of 
being used to pay for the modernization of fixed assets, is 
spent as benefits payments or bonuses. Thus state assets are not 
compensated minimally, making even simple reproduction 
unsustainable. 
  Using State Assets Without Compensation 
  Some enterprises owned by the whole people nominally lease 
out their fixed assets to their collective enterprises for use 
by the latter. In reality, however, no lease agreement was 
signed by a representative of the lessor and the collective 
enterprise, and certainly no leasing fee was collected. In 
effect state assets are used gratuitously, an infringement upon 
the rights and interests of the owner, the state. 
  Plants and Equipment Allowed To Sit Idle 
  Due to mismanagement and the poor quality of their products, 
a number of collective enterprises have been losing money year 
after year. Some of them have even suspended production, idling 
many plants and much equipment. They neither report such idling 
to the authorities above nor maintain and upkeep the equipment. 
Thus the assets affected are not put to the proper use. 
  Administrative and Institutional Units Losing State 
Assets 
  Administrative and institutional units use state assets 
without paying for them to "raise revenue." The loss of state 
assets mainly occurs when the revenue thus earned goes into 
"mini treasuries," when nonoperational assets are turned into 
operational assets, when money-making units fail to take 
depreciation or do so minimally, and when the costs and expenses 
of such units are not calculated accurately; that is, expenses 
that should be paid for by the units are still taken care of by 
the state treasury. 
  An investigation in late 1993 by the Guangxi regional 
properties bureau into the loss of state assets by several 
administrative and institutional units uncovers the following 
problems: 
  Lack of effective methods to manage the state assets used in 
revenue-raising activities and the profits derived therefrom. 
Revenue-raising activities by administrative and institutional 
units these days take a variety of forms, but for the most part 
they involve leasing out state land or renting out stadiums, 
buildings, houses, and equipment built or paid for by state 
funds or using such land and facilities in joint business 
ventures and contracting schemes. 
  Borrowing public funds to set up economic entities without 
going through the regular borrowing procedures. To support their 
newly established economic entities, most units make loans to 
them from the extra-budget funds as seed money. However, a large 
number of units fail to make out the proper loan agreements. 
Instead, the loans are entered under the "temporary payment" 
category on the books. Should the loan be used to pay investment 
dividends or interest on loans? That is not clearly stated. Also 
left undefined are the two parties' rights, responsibilities, 
and interests. Even the loan's maturation period is unclear. In 
the course of time it becomes difficult to track down where 
funds have gone, determine whether they have been lost, or find 
out who should be held liable. 
  Buildings, stadiums, and houses are rented out for 
excessively long periods without going through the standard 
evaluation and bidding procedures. In pursuit of profits, 
administrative and institutional units lease out the buildings, 
stadiums, and land for overly long periods of time. The land is 
not appraised prior to the lease and there is no bidding before 
a building is rented out. When land and buildings are leased out 
at bargain rates for excessively long periods of time, the 
interests of the state suffer directly. 
  Loss of State Assets in Assets Disposal 
  Land is being sold off at low prices. Some units allocated 
land have made a fortune in real estate speculation. Public 
housing is being sold at medium or low prices. Hengyang Shi in 
Hunan Province is one city experimenting with housing reform. By 
late June 1993, 3 million square kilometers of public housing 
had been sold at prices averaging no more than 120 yuan per 
square kilometer, while it cost between 950 and 980 yuan to 
build one square kilometer of comparable housing in the city and 
commercial housing was being sold at 1,200 yuan per square 
kilometer. In other words, public housing was sold at one-eighth 
the cost and one-tenth the market price.

Pudong's Year of New Image; Interview With Zhao Qizheng, 
Shanghai Deputy Mayor and Director of the Pudong New District 
Administrative Committee"] 
  [Exerpts] Pudong, a resplendent, bright pearl rising in the 
east! Since Deng Xiaoping made his important speech during his 
inspection tour of southern China, it has changed every year, 
and every three years, it has changed greatly, displaying its 
strong vitality and developmental staying power, becoming a new 
growth spot and comprehensive trial zone for developing 
Shanghai's economy. It has received wide and close attention 
from everyplace, both overseas and domestic, and especially in 
financial, investment, enterprise, and transportation circles. 
  With the coming of the new year of 1994, in order to gain a 
deep understanding of the new achievements and new steps in 
developing Pudong, and answer some questions raised by Hong Kong 
and overseas people concerning that development, a delegation 
headed by the Director of our magazine XIE MINGGAN [6200 2494 
1626] recently made a special trip to Shanghai to interview the 
Deputy Mayor Zhao Qizheng, who is in charge of Pudong's 
development. 
  Deputy Mayor Zhao met Xie Minggan's group in a tastefully 
decorated guest room in Pudong's New District Administrative 
Committee. Outdoors it was harsh winter, but indoors it was as 
warm as spring. The host and his guests chatted cheerfully and 
humorously. Deputy Mayor Zhao is very busy in his work, but he 
is an energetic and quick-witted person. He is very familiar 
with Pudong development, and after exchanging a few words of 
greeting, we came to our topic. 
  Question: In 1993, Pudong New District tried to strengthen 
its general supportive function for city construction on a base 
of stressing doing well the job of developing the role of key 
small districts, strengthening comprehensive treatment of social 
development, as well as making further exploration of developing 
the operation of the socialist market economic system. Please 
outline 1993's achievements in these areas. 
  Answer: On New Year's Day 1993, the Shanghai government 
established the Pudong New District Administrative Committee to 
speed up Pudong's development and implement comprehensive and 
unified administration for the new district. During the year, 
Pudong New District has developed rapidly in various areas. 
  (1) There was a great deal of growth in the domestic 
economy. 
  --The gross domestic output value has achieved "doubling in 
three years." Last year, the gross domestic output value in the 
New District reached 16.4 billion yuan and, if calculated by 
comparable prices, it increased 100 percent since 1990 and 30 
percent since 1992. Meanwhile, service industries have been 
increasing at the same rate as the gross domestic output value. 
Last year, the increased value of service industries reached 
4.66 billion yuan, a 46.6 percent increase by the same rate, 
higher than that of secondary industry. 
  --Fixed asset investment increased one-fold over 1992. The 
investment mix tended to be more reasonable. Construction of the 
city's infrastructure and the rate of investment in service 
industries increased significantly. 
  --Financial income increased at the same rate as the gross 
domestic output value. Last year, the district level financial 
income took in 1 billion yuan in the New District, which was a 
more than 70 percent increase over 1992. 
  --The financial ability of financial organs in the New 
District increased one fold. Last year, the balance from 
deposits and loans in 10 domestic banks Pudong branches was over 
50 billion yuan, a one-fold increase over 1992, which showed 
fully the significant achievement of the strategy of "finance is 
first" in Pudong development. 
  (2) Overall achievements in urban construction. 
  Enthusiastically helped the city to complete such big and 
important projects as the Yangpu bridge, the Pudong section of 
the inner circle, two massive interchanges, the new port zone of 
Waigaoqiao, the Linqiao water works, etc. 
  Paid close attention to projects for widening and remaking 
seven backbone roads such as Yuanshen Road and Longdong Road 
which connect small development districts and major municipal 
works. The total length is 20 Km, with total investment of 1.2 
billion yuan. After working day and night for half a year, it 
was finished completely in December of last year, which further 
improved the environment for investment in Pudong. 
  (3) Key small districts in the New District have entered a 
new stage of functional development. 
  In keeping with the State Council's strategic decisions 
concerning Pudong's development and opening, last year we set 
out new development objectives for fostering and strengthening 
functional development in each key, small, development district. 
At present, construction is fully under way on 50 financial and 
trade buildings in the Lujiazhui Finance and Trade Zone, an 
emerging, embryonic form of China's CBD zone; the 200 projects 
imported to the Jinqiao Export Processing Zone are listed as 
number one among all development zones in China from their 
average investment of US$15 million per project. In addition, 
the production rate of 30 projects has put them into a 
profitable phase; the Waigaoqiao bonded zone has $2.3 billion 
total investment from foreign business, and the Shanghai bonded 
production materials market, the largest such in China, has gone 
into full operation; the Zhangjiang High Technology Zone is also 
following closely, with mutual development of each key, small 
district's support function, creating the conditions for the New 
District to accomplish its historical mission. 
  (4) Strengthened comprehensive treatment of social 
development in the New District. 
  The New District gives considerable attention to building 
moral civilization and comprehensive social treatment, insisting 
on anti-corruption, advocating honesty, and promoting legal 
construction. First of all, we established the Chuansha Police 
Office, and hired 14 legal specialists and well known lawyers to 
make up a legal consulting group for the New District; the Labor 
Department in the New District adopted positive reform measures, 
arranging appropriately compensation for farmers whose land was 
taken for the New District; as for the social problems brought 
on by a large number of migrants, the New District promptly 
researched countermeasures, strengthened administration, and 
vigorously went after a small number of criminals to guarantee a 
stable social environment for developing and building Pudong. 
  (5) Positively studies the establishment of a socialist 
market economic system of operations. 
  This includes, primarily: centered on the strategic goal of 
building up Shanghai as an international economic, financial, 
and trade center, the New District has enthusiastically invited 
foreign capital banks to establish branches in Pudong, and 
attracted international capital through multiple channels (there 
are now 26 foreign capital branch banks, and foreign capital or 
joint venture financial corporations). The first one established 
was the Waigaoqiao bonded production materials market (to date, 
there are four branch markets). We established a State-owned 
assets administrative corporation in the New District, to 
strengthen administration of State-owned assets. We have 
enthusiastically developed a personnel market and a technology 
market, and experimented with the reform of an agricultural 
cooperative joint stock system. 
  Question: You have proposed that 1994 should be Pudong New 
District's "year of image-making." Could you tell us what kind 
image will Pudong have before the world in 1994? 
  Answer: We call 1994 our "year of image-making," because 
Pudong has a three step goal of laying a foundation by 1995, 
forming the primary framework by 2000, and then establishing 
ourselves as an international economic, financial and trade 
center by 2010, so the primary image for the "foundation" of 
1995 should make its general appearance in 1994. Primarily, this 
means: 
  --The image of infrastructure: while there will be 
support for the major and important municipal works associated 
with the eastern and western parts of the city, the key lies in 
10 infrastructure projects in the New District, including 
supporting projects in the Pudong section of a double line 
tunnel, an axial highway, the project to widen Zhangyang Road, 
around the periphery of the river, and a group of interchanges, 
transformers and substations, etc., add 200,000 cable TVs and 
170,000 telephones and a group of gasoline stations. This will 
basically establish a networked system of modernized 
transportation, telecommunications and energy, displaying the 
primary framework of a modern urban area. 
  --The image of municipal appearance and 
environment: focusing on the 10 fundamental municipal works 
already completed during the Eighth Five Year Plan, we will 
begin a comprehensive project of afforestation and environmental 
protection around the tourist routes and major scenes in Pudong. 
We will especially increase forest construction, starting to 
build such forestry projects as Central Park, Dezhou Park, etc., 
adding 2 million square meters of wooded areas in the new 
district. This will further improve the municipal appearance and 
environment of Pudong New District. 
---The image of the new city center area: in 1994, 
on the other side of the Bund, the Eastern Shining Pearl TV 
tower and the first section of Bingjiang Avenue will be 
completed, and construction will start on Fudu World. Meanwhile, 
more than 30 buildings around that area will reach over 40 
meters of their major structure on the ground, and nearly 20 
buildings will be completed. This will give Pudong's new Bund a 
beautiful appearance. 
  ---The image of a modernized processing zone for 
exports: in the Jingqiao processing zone for exports, six 
square km of "seven throughs and one flat" will be developed and 
built, which will bring in a total of more than 300 domestic and 
foreign capital projects. There are now 200 projects under 
construction, and nearly 100 enterprises including Hitachi 
Electric and Sharp Air Conditioning, have finished construction 
and gone into production. This has achieved a yearly output 
value of three billion yuan, becoming the processing base for 
export with the shortest construction cycle, richest technical 
content, fastest economic efficiency, and best environment 
protection in China. 
  --The image of a free trade zone: in 1994, in the 
Gaoqiao Bonded Zone, construction will end on 6 square km of 
"seven throughs and one flat," and a 4 square km area will be 
closed and put into operation. For the more than 1,000 Chinese 
and foreign capital enterprises which are engaged in entrepot 
trade, or international trade, the volume of their import and 
export business will be double that of last year. The Shanghai 
bonded production materials exchange market has been formed to a 
certain degree, with a focus on steel, construction materials 
and textile raw materials. 
  --The image of commercial culture: the Wendeng 
Road commercial street will be finished comprehensively, forming 
the New District's first street for tourist sightseeing and 
shopping. Covering 600 thousand square meters, equivalent to 
about two Nanjing Roads, its commercial facilities are under 
accelerated construction. Meanwhile, a group of projects 
consisting of a newly established elementary school, high 
school, hospital, welfare facility and sports center, a golf 
course, etc., have gone into construction. In the Zhangyang Road 
and Huamu areas, these will create a brand new image for the 
Zhangyang Road commercial center, developing and building an 
attractive commercial, tourist and cultural center, complete 
with municipal government, culture, and central park. 
  Question: In 1994, the Chinese government will implement 
important reforms in the tax system. What affects will these 
have on Pudong New District's development and construction? Will 
the environment tend to be loose or tight? 
  Answer: On 1 January, 1994, China launched tax reforms in 
areas dealing with foreign investment enterprises, abandoning 
unified industrial and commercial taxes, implementing a value 
added tax, a consumption tax, and a business tax. The principal 
objective is to simplify the tax system and correspond to the 
international tax system. 
  Internationally, and especially in the developed nations of 
the West, a value added tax is collected on the value added part 
of goods sold; while China formerly collected a uniform 
industrial and commercial tax on goods sold by foreign 
nationals' enterprises, the tax linked to goods sold could not 
be deducted directly within the borders of China, but would have 
to be waived or returned to customers or import-export organs in 
accordance with the regulation of duty free or tax return. This 
way takes a long time, has many steps, and is quite complicated. 
Now, having our system in line with the western tax system will 
totally resolve the problem of deducting and returning the tax. 
  After the new tax system has taken effect, the Chinese 
Government will adopt certain measures to protect the profits of 
foreign businesses. We have already made it clear that to ease 
the added tax burden tax reform causes for foreign enterprises, 
within a certain period we will adopt such measures as tax 
rebates, temporary delays in collecting the tax, etc. This will 
enable foreign investment enterprises to maintain their former 
tax burden, and not increase the circulating tax burden. 
  In addition to this, Pudong New District will not make any 
changes in the preferential income tax policies for foreign 
investment enterprises and foreign enterprises. Therefore, the 
Chinese Government's major reforms in the tax system will be 
favorable for regulating the investment environment in Pudong 
New District, giving it a better investment future. 
  Question: How about the scale of the enterprises investing 
in 
Pudong New District with the three types of capital? What have 
you done to attract the world's famous transnational 
corporations to invest in Pudong, and what do you plan to do in 
the future? 
  Answer: At the end of 1993, Pudong New District had approved 
a total of 1,625 enterprises invested with foreign capital, 
having a gross investment of $6.546 billion, and agreements to 
absorb $3.269 billion in foreign capital, with a per enterprise 
average investment of $4.02 million with the three types of 
capital, and $2.01 million agreed to on absorbing foreign 
capital. This makes us fourth nationally, and higher than the 
average investment level ($2.3 million). Among these, 178 
enterprises invested with the three types of capital have over 5 
million dollars' gross investment, constituting 10.9 percent of 
the total foreign invested projects in Pudong, 65 percent of the 
gross investment, and is up to $4.255 billion. There are 117 
enterprises which have over $10 million gross investment, 
constituting 7.19 percent of the total number of projects, 59.03 
percent of the gross investment and is up to $3.864 billion. At 
the end of 1992, the average project had 45 percent foreign 
capital content, while in 924 projects approved throughout 1993, 
the average foreign capital content had increased to 55.3 
percent. [passage omitted] 
  Question: Currently, land leasing in Pudong still mostly 
takes the way of approving leases through agreement. From now 
on, will you go the way of inviting vendors or auction, which is 
more common in the world, bringing land to full efficiency in 
market competition? 
  Answer: We always persist in valuing land as if it were 
gold. 
Since establishing the New District Administrative Commission, 
we comprehensively strengthened land development administration, 
and initiated a chargeable land using system. 
  In Pudong New District, development and construction on 
whole 
pieces of land is generally done through investment by the city 
government or the New District Administrative Commission, and 
chiefly by state-owned corporations buying the land from the 
state, conducting "seven throughs and one flat" construction on 
it, after which there is another transfer. In addition, a small 
amount of land is directly approved for rental to foreign 
business and their domestic associated enterprises. To date, 
nearly 50 square km in whole parcels of land have been taken and 
transmitted by the six big state-owned development corporations, 
and one-third of these have completed development. 
  In 1993, in order to strengthen land administration, we put 
a stress in our land management work. By persisting in approving 
land according to the projects and approving projects according 
to their efficiency, we achieved orderly land development, with 
basically no land available for "land speculators." 
  While chiefly going the way of approving leases to transfer 
lands, we are breeding the means of inviting vendors or auction, 
which are common throughout the world. In the first part of this 
year, we will extend initial invitations to vendors on a piece 
of land about 6 thousand square meters (Zhangyang Road 23-G). 
We are now preparing the plans for this.

"Shanghai Property Rights Exchange Operation Next Month"] 
  [Text] Established by the 1994 No 1 approval document of 
the Shanghai People's government, the Shanghai Urban and Rural 
Property Rights Exchange Office will officially go into 
operation at the beginning of April. The Chairman of the 
Exchange Office Gong Jiemin [7895 0094 3046] told me days 
earlier that over 100 medium and small scale enterprises, having 
an average capital value of 2.8 million yuan, had applied to 
enter the exchange market. From these, the Exchange Office has 
selected 30 enterprises having good efficiency to be the first 
group of enterprises on the market. 
  Enterprise property exchange is the inevitable outcome of 
developing a socialist market economy. Compensated property 
transferral is useful to setting the parameters of enterprises' 
property rights, and smoothing enterprise property rights 
relationships to preserve or add value to state-owned or 
collective assets; it is favorable to straightening out the 
assets of current enterprises, and especially straightening out 
the assets of enterprises with low profitability and suffering 
losses, to realize a reasonable asset flow. The establishment 
and operation of the Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Rights 
Exchange Office demonstrates that Shanghai has once again take a 
new step towards establishing the new socialist market economy. 
  Because exchange of enterprise property on the market is 
still in the explorational stage in China, Shanghai has chosen 
to take the easy steps first, and defer the difficult for later, 
then progressively expand the process, starting with collective 
enterprises. The newly established Shanghai Urban and Rural 
Property Rights Exchange Office is under the charge of the 
Agriculture Commission, the Municipal Office of System Reform, 
the Municipal Bureau of Commerce and Industry, the Municipal, 
Suburban, and County Industrial Bureau, and the Municipal Land 
Bureau, all members of the Administrative Commission. The 
property exchange office will adopt the membership system to 
absorb a group of financial and investment organs, large scale 
enterprise groups, and foreign capital organs as members of the 
operation (brokers). These are specialists in acting as exchange 
agents, and self-operated businesses and enterprises on the 
market can entrust brokers to conduct exchanges. What is 
different from other exchange offices is that in property 
exchanges, the exchange involves not only material objects of 
assets, but invisible assets as well. The process will consist 
of registration and application, making public notice of their 
going into the market, negotiation and inquiry, striking a deal 
via computer, signing the contract, revising the registration 
procedure, etc. It is stronger technologically, with more 
widespread involvement. By gathering opinions widely, and making 
multiple revisions, the property exchange office has formulated 
seven regulatory documents, including the rules of the office, 
temporary administrative measures for members, etc. From now on, 
enterprises must go to the property rights exchange office for 
public transfer of property rights, while the assets evaluation 
department conducts an evaluation of the enterprise assets, and 
make it known publicly. Through negotiations and inquiry, all 
parties on the accepting side will offer bids by computers, and 
the party offering the higher price will be favored in obtaining 
the exchange. The exchange office and the brokers will supply 
supporting "integrated" services for property rights exchanges 
for enterprises. 
  At present, all preparation work prior to the Shanghai Urban 
and Rural Property Rights Exchange Office going into operation 
has been completed. Staff who have had primary business training 
and the first group of brokers are in position, the exchange 
computer system is installed with debugging fully under way, the 
property exchange information network has been primarily 
established, composed of Shanghai information transmission 
organs, each province's asset administration organs, Shanghai's 
overseas organs, etc. Review and verification has also been 
completed for the first group of 30 enterprises in the market.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhang Wen (4545 7186): "Perfecting the Taxation </F>
System: Effectively Dealing With the Relations in the Intended 
Tax Assignment System"] 
  [Text] Because delineations in matters of rights and 
responsibilities are vague, some localities frequently exceed 
the limits of their authority, thereby impairing the central 
authorities's macro-regulation of the national 
  economy, and thereby also restricting any full 
development of the very function of taxation. 
  Since 1979, main emphasis in the systematic reform of the 
tax 
system had been placed on effectively dealing with the relation 
between state and enterprises in matters of distribution, and 
the readjustment of the relations between central government and 
local government finances had been neglected. It is for this 
reason that the current system of tax management lags behind the 
reform of the tax system. This is the cause of much confusion in 
actual practice, and is one of the primary reasons for the 
prevailing vague delineation of rights and responsibilities as 
between the central authorities and the local authorities. As a 
result, it is now an extremely widespread occurrence that local 
authorities exceed the limits of their own administrative 
authority and infringe on central authority domain. This, in 
turn, adversely affects the central government's ability for 
macro-regulation of the national economy, and also restricts the 
full development of the very function of taxation. It has 
therefore become even more urgent to initiate a system of tax 
assignments. 
<H5>  Which Specific Form of Tax Assignment System To Select? </H5>
  We may select one of the following forms for the intended 
tax 
assignment system: 
  1) the form in which all tax categories are clearly divided 
up; 2) the form in which the various tax categories are divided 
up, but which also includes some that are jointly shared. The 
method of sharing the joint categories may be either by separate 
collections, by proportionate distribution, or by 
  surtaxes and refunds; 3) the form of mainly separately 
sharing in tax rates. 
  The first form may be considered the unitary system, and the 
two other forms may be called mixed forms. Generally speaking, 
adopting the form of completely dividing up all tax categories 
would be the most thorough way to do it, as it would make it 
possible, through the division of the tax sources, to clearly 
establish the income distribution between central authorities 
and local authorities. It would also make it possible, by 
adhering to the principle of unison of financial rights and 
responsibilities, to improve the dismal state of central 
finances. One may, however, counter that this is only good as an 
abstract theory, and that it is almost impossible in actual 
practice to truly effect so clear a division. The reason for 
this is that there is a multitude of factors that cause changes 
in revenue and expenditure of public finance. Generally, it is 
easier to adopt a mixed form, as these forms will have a certain 
elasticity in the division of tax revenue. Looking at the actual 
conditions in China, we see that, on the one hand, it has been 
customary for a long time to share revenue, and, on the other 
hand, that any division in the tax system is beset with many 
practical difficulties, because the tax sources cannot all of a 
sudden be divided up thus clearly. It is therefore my opinion 
that adoption of a form that provides for common sharing would 
be more feasible and more appropriate. As to which specific 
pattern to choose among those available in this kind of a form 
with common sharing, no preference can be claimed by any one of 
them, but the pattern of proportionate sharing comes closer to 
Chinese usage. 
<H5>  How To Resolve Regional Differences? </H5>
  For the resolution of regional differences, there are the 
following alternatives: 
  1) The method of "large unison with small differences." 
That would mean, the norms for tax sharing would be more or 
less the same for the whole country, and economically backward 
regions would have to use other means, such as subsidies, 
preferential treatment, etc. to achieve in effect a policy of 
  due differentiations in regional treatments. 
  2) The method of "small unison with large differences." 
That would mean, that districts throughout the country would be 
classed as high, medium, and low categories, according to 
disparities in economic development, and that different methods 
would then be applied to the different categories. 
  In my opinion, the first method would be preferable. This 
method would have the system appear as much more unified, and it 
would also avoid making the system excessively cumbersome and 
complex. It would help keep the whole tax management system 
appropriately simple and be more convenient in the actual 
application of the new system. Adopting the method of subsidies 
would conform to international practices, and would, compared 
with China's traditional method of large disparities, give full 
scope to the redistribution of financial resources. It would 
also strengthen the supervisory powers of the central 
authorities over this part of the funds and would also impel the 
local authorities to properly use these funds. In the opposite 
case, if the second method would be adopted, it could engender 
in its actual execution--judging by the performances of the 
past--much imitation, mutual rivalry, and evasive compromises, 
while it would be difficult to appropriately decide on the 
particular categories of the districts. 
  Establishing a Scientific System of Indices 
  The greatest difficulty in every past attempt to reform the 
management system of public finance was the determination of the 
base figures for regional revenue and expenditure and 
determining the proportions to be shared by central and local 
authorities. The main causes for this appear to have been the 
lack of a rational system of indices and of subjective will, and 
the dominant position of vested interests. Normally, the figures 
in the final accounts of revenue and expenditure of a certain 
year or of several years were taken as reliable data for the 
determination of the base figure, and based on these, the 
proportions of income to be shared by central and local 
governments would be determined. Because these figures are 
subject to fortuitous changes over short periods of time, this 
method lays the seeds for future fights over base figures and 
proportions between central authorities and local authorities, 
and leads--in fact did so for a long time in the past--to 
unending wrangling during the process of demarcating revenue and 
expenditures, which then had also each time adversely affected 
the results of the reforms. The tax assignment system that is 
now being planned must absorb the lessons of the past several 
attempts at reforming the system of public finance, and must 
first provide a scientific system of indices, and on that 
foundation rationally demarcate the tax revenue for the various 
levels of governments, so as to ensure feasibility as well as 
stability of the new system. 
  Appropriate Delineation of Levels of Tax Management 
  The ultimate purpose of the delineation of levels of tax 
management is the accurate division of responsibilities and 
limits of authority as between governments of different ranks. 
Judging by the successful experiences in other countries with 
the tax assignment system, tax management levels are to be 
always identical with the levels of political administration; 
commonly there are three levels of administration. In view of 
the actual situation in China, it should also be considered to 
differentiate, in conformity with the levels in public finance 
administration, between the three administrative levels: the 
central authorities, the provinces (autonomous regions, 
centrally controlled municipalities), and the counties (cities), 
each with its own tax sources. Taxation at the latter two levels 
would then constitute local taxation. This kind of demarcation 
would essentially conform to the levels of political 
administration in China, would be comparatively clear, and also 
convenient in actual management. However a few points must be 
explained here: 
  1) Village finances, even though one level of financial 
administration, need not be a separate and independent level, 
because village governments have very limited responsibilities 
and authority, and bear almost no economic functions. Their 
affairs could therefore be administered unifiedly at the county 
  (city) level. 2) Delineation of the limits of 
administrative authority of the provinces is extremely 
important, because the provinces bear the heavy responsibility 
of dealing with a dual distribution relation, namely between 
central authorities and provinces and between provinces and 
counties; they must have a considerable scope of authority. 3) 
Because cities with provincial status enjoy administrative 
authority equal to that of provinces, their revenue and 
expenditure is not connected with those of the provinces. They 
can therefore be administered in the same way as provinces. 
Moreover, even though these cities have a lot of tax revenue -- 
most are one of the supporting pillars of their provinces -- 
according to the guiding idea of the "great unison," they can 
also only adopt the same indices, just as throughout the entire 
country, in the delineation of tax revenue. This may also 
promote their even faster development. 
  Specific Designs for the Intended Tax Assignment System 
  The key question in designing the tax assignment system is 
the renewed determination and demarcation of financial authority 
and financial resources as between the central authorities and 
the local governments. This touches on the interests of both 
sides. On the one hand, the principle of unison of financial 
authority and executive power should be upheld; on the other 
hand, however, it is also necessary to consider a series of 
other factors, such as the macro strategic objectives of the 
state, social policies, and the functions of local governments. 
Determination of financial power and financial resources 
between the various levels of government must mainly be 
accomplished through the delimitation of tax categories, tax 
rates, and tax management. 
  The idea of demarcation of tax categories. In the 
demarcation 
of tax categories, i.e. in the question of how to select the tax 
sources of the central government and those of the local 
authorities, one may adopt different models. At present, 
different opinions are held by different circles of society. In 
my opinion, a choice has to be made between the following two 
models: 
  First Model: The starting point in one's considerations must 
be the need to ensure revenue and to ensure the central 
authority's ability to effect regulation and control. 
According to the special characteristics of the tax revenue 
structure in recent years, the first consideration must be to 
preserve the financial resources required by the central 
government for its normal functions. Second consideration must 
be to distribute between central and local authorities when tax 
revenue increases. Third consideration must be the degree of 
difficulty encountered in levying and administering the taxes, 
because for some tax categories collection and administration 
may be a dispersed affair and posing great difficulties in 
administration. Such taxes must not be made tax categories of 
the central authorities, but may be administered by the local 
authorities. 
  According to the above-stated principle, product tax, 
value-added tax, special activities tax are tax categories that 
should be assigned to the central authorities. Income tax of 
enterprises, social security tax, and business tax are tax 
categories whose tax sources are closely linked to economic 
development and which are characterized by great unevenness. 
These tax categories may be commonly shared by central 
authorities and local authorities. Most of the remaining tax 
categories may be made local tax sources. 
  Second Model: Dividing up tax categories according to their 
nature into those to be tax sources of the central authorities 
and those to be tax sources of the local authorities. First, 
customs duties, which are needed to maintain the sovereignty of 
the state, and the salt tax, which is best unifiedly 
administered by the state, must be designated central authority 
taxes. Second, high-rate product tax, which the state uses as a 
means to prevent duplication of production, the fixed asset 
investment tax for the regulation of investment activities, also 
taxes on relevant activities of a special kind, must be assigned 
to the central authorities. Third, in the case of large items of 
tax revenue, which ensure the financial resources of the central 
authorities, such as value-added tax, it may be considered to 
assign a large proportion of them to the central authorities as 
their revenue. Some other taxes, directly related to production 
and circulation, may be assigned, because of their rather wide 
fluctuations, to both the central authorities and the local 
authorities for common administration, so that both may have 
benefits from them and also commonly bear the risks. Tax 
categories that are of less value, for which collection and 
administration is scattered over a wide area and that have a 
local character, may be left to be the fixed revenue of the 
local authorities. 
  Delineation of the limits of authority in tax management. 
Authority in tax management comprises the right to legislate on 
tax matters, the right of interpretation, the right to adjust 
tax rates and tax items, and the right to reduce taxes and 
exempt from taxes. This delineation is closely liked to the 
demarcation of tax sources. As the levels to which the tax 
categories belong differ, so differ the levels of authority in 
tax management. 
  The basic demand in the demarcation of tax management 
authorities is to appropriately expand the administrative 
authority of the local governments, always on the precondition 
of ensuring the central authorities' ability to exercise 
macro-regulation and control. It is possible to prescribe in 
general that governments of all levels shall enjoy authority to 
manage their own tax categories. In this way, the legislative 
power in matters of central authority taxes is exercised by the 
National People's Congress. The State Administration of Taxation 
is responsible for interpretations and for the promulgation of 
enforcement provisions, which will then have to be enforced by 
tax bureaus at all level. The legislative power in tax matters 
of governments of the provincial level is exercised by the 
provincial people's representative assemblies, and tax rules are 
interpreted by the provincial tax bureaus, who will also 
promulgate enforcement provisions and enforce the tax rules. 
Taxation at the county level is handled similar to the procedure 
at the provincial level. At the same time, the local governments 
have certain rights with regard to taxation initiated for new 
tax categories. All legislative power concerning tax categories 
that benefit both the central authorities and the local 
authorities rests with the central authorities, so as to ensure 
revenue for the central authorities and to strengthen the 
central authority's control over the local authorities. However, 
the enforcement authority may, according to different 
circumstances, be assigned to both to exercise in common, as 
this may be beneficial for raising enthusiasm among the local 
authorities. 
  To bring the above plan closer to realization, the authority 
in tax management may be assigned in the following 
administrative forms: 
  Central authority taxes are to be legislated and enforced by 
the central authorities, and the entire administrative authority 
over them is centralized in the central government. 
  In the case of taxes benefiting jointly both the central 
authorities and local authorities, the central government is to 
legislate and the State Administration of Taxation is to 
interpret and to determine specific enforcement provisions. The 
right of adjustments and the right to reduce taxes and exempt 
from taxes shall be exercised separately by either the central 
authorities or the local authorities. 
  The province- and county-level governments shall each 
separately have authority in the administration of most of the 
local taxes, and the central authorities shall not have the 
right to interfere. 
  Province- and county-level governments, acting within the 
sphere of their jurisdictions, may, as circumstances demand, 
initiate taxation in new tax categories. Administrative 
authority over these tax categories shall completely be 
exercised by the local governments, so as to have the local 
authorities enhance their financial resources, raise enthusiasm 
for revenue increases, and also because it will be beneficial 
for greater involvement of the local governments in the local 
economic activities of their own localities.

<F P=106> [Article by Han Shujun (7281 3219 0689), Director of the </F>
Financial Planning Office, Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation: "Several Opinions on Causes of, Methods 
for Resolving Disparities in Bilateral Trade Statistics"] 
  [Text] [Editor's Note] There have been rapid 
developments in China's foreign trade since reform and the 
open-door policy. Concurrently, there are ever larger 
discrepancies in statistical data between China and the world's 
major trading partners which create more trade friction. 
Towards this end, the author explores the causes of and methods 
for resolving statistical discrepancies produced in 
country-to-country trade from the perspective of international 
trade statistical theory and methods. In awaiting a correct 
conclusion, this publication welcomes manuscripts from many 
statistical experts and scholars in hopes of further discussion 
and research on the issue. 
  Following rapid development of China's foreign trade in 
recent years, there have been ever larger disparities in 
statistical data between China and the world's major trading 
partners. The trend is increasing. The issue of bilateral 
statistical figure disparities is common worldwide in 
inter-country trade, for example, between the United States and 
Japan, Japan and Germany, Germany and the United States, or 
France and Canada. Many reasons account for the disparities, 
such as different trade statistic principles, the scope of trade 
statistics, trade record systems, ad valorem standards, currency 
conversion standards or different statistical time periods. 
Trade statistic principles are the fundamental cause of 
bilateral trade statistic disparities. 
<H5>  I. Trade Statistic Disparities Created by Using </H5>
Producer-Consumer Country Statistical Accounting Principles 
  At present most countries and regions in the world use the 
country of origin as the import statistical accounting principle 
and the end-user (destination) country as the export statistical 
accounting principle (abbreviated as producer-consumer country). 
China's import and export statistics published overseas also are 
like this. 
  A. Implications of producer-consumer country statistical 
principle. 
  Country of origin generally refers to the producing country 
of agricultural products, the country extracting mineral 
products (entirely or partially), or the manufacturer of 
manufactured products. For example, with partial manufacture it 
usually is understood that country of origin refers to the 
country responsible for the final stage of the manufacturing 
operation before a commodity takes final form. Consumer country 
refers to the ultimate consuming, using or further processing 
country of a said commodity at the time of transport, including 
commercial transactions which occur in intermediary countries. 
  B. Advantages and disadvantages of producer-consumer 
statistical principle 
  1. According to country of origin statistical analysis of 
imports, it is advantageous to indicate the direct relationship 
between the producing and importing countries. Such material is 
essential for managing import quotas and implementing 
differential duties. The basis for determining country of origin 
comes from the regulation of place of origin. Countries which 
use place of origin regulations both must determine exported 
commodities from their own country and also utilize place of 
origin regulations to determine the place of origin of imported 
commodities. The role of country of origin statistics is more 
prominent under current conditions of emphasizing fair trade and 
stronger trade protectionism. Place of origin regulations 
themselves are a type of trade policy or means of trade 
management. They are preferential treatment given by one country 
to another or standards for determining quantity restrictions on 
imported commodities (such as textile quotas and other commodity 
quotas). As for some developed countries, they also restrict 
foreign investment enterprises which produce, process or 
assemble products from using its status in the country to seize 
its markets. For example, the EC strictly regulates Japanese 
processing and assembly enterprises (which are called 
"screwdriver factories") on its territory; certain products are 
only considered EC products when more than 50 percent of added 
value is done in the EC. The United States has established 
automobile parts enterprises in Canada and Canada has stipulated 
that products must have a relatively high proportion of added 
value before they can be considered to be Canadian products. The 
aim of such practices is to reduce situations where the country 
itself has no foreign exchange income but wants to assume a 
trade surplus. To a certain extent such practices naturally 
restrict the inflow of foreign investment. Used for export 
statistics, the concept of "consumer country" mainly is to 
understand the relationship between producer country and 
importing country. 
  2. The main disadvantage of the producer-consumer country 
principle. Considered from the aspect of country of origin, 
country of origin regulation standards differ in stipulations 
because various countries have different degrees of 
industrialization and different trade policies. There is still 
no binding international pact. For example, regarding country 
of origin, besides tallying with the definition of country of 
origin stated by the United Nations, the major developed 
countries, in particular with regard to determination of country 
of origin for countries partially manufacturing finished 
products, stipulate that processed products should have a rather 
high proportion of added value (varying 40 to 60 percent). That 
is to say, country of origin must at the same time possess two 
conditions: responsibility for the final stage of manufacturing 
and added value proportion (actual proportions of various 
countries differ). Some countries take the country responsible 
for a commodity's final stage of manufacture just prior to its 
ultimate form as the major determinant. A commodity's added 
value proportion (generally speaking, the added value proportion 
is comparatively low, at around 25 to 30 percent) is the 
determinant only when it is impossible to determine the final 
manufacturing country. Ordinarily, country of origin 
determination for an imported commodity is based on the customs 
declaration form filled out by the importer. The importing 
country uses its own country of origin regulations to determine 
only when questionable. Obviously, although use of country of 
origin principle statistics for imports accords with 
international custom, it actually has created difficulties in 
comparing statistics between countries. Considering the 
consumer country's perspective, a country often cannot determine 
a commodity's ultimate consuming country because it is extremely 
difficult to record accurately, particularly when goods are not 
directly shipped to the importing country from the producing 
country. A country often cannot determine a commodity's ultimate 
consumer country. It is also difficult to make determinations 
from statistical origin evidence (customs declaration forms). 
Furthermore, one country's statistical boundaries may not extend 
to other countries and regions. Therefore, material on consumer 
country statistics on exports actually are very incomplete and 
inaccurate. 
  3. The serious insufficiency of adopting the consumer 
country 
principle for statistics also lies in that if goods are not 
imported directly from the producing country, there is no way 
for the exporting and importing countries to have corresponding 
statistics for the same goods. Thus it is harmful to comparing 
statistics among partnering countries. Analyses of trade 
conditions with such statistical information, in particular 
analyses of international income and expenditure situations, 
will play a harmful role. 
  An example of Sino-U.S. bilateral trade statistics: 
According 
to Chinese statistics , if it is known that the consumer country 
of a batch of goods is the United States at the time of export, 
it is listed as U.S. export statistics. If a batch of goods is 
known to be headed for Hong Kong at the time of export, it can 
only be listed as Hong Kong export statistics. As for this 
batch of products later being transshipped from Hong Kong to the 
United States without China's knowledge, then naturally there is 
no way to list it statistically as exports for the United 
States. According to U.S. statistics, if a good is produced in 
China, regardless of whether it is directly imported from China 
or via Hong Kong, country of origin import statistics uniformly 
list it as an import from China. Thus, U.S. export figures 
greatly exceed Chinese statistics to the United States. Likewise 
this applies to goods flowing in the opposite direction. 
Obviously the more Chinese commodities in entrepot trade through 
Hong Kong, the greater the disparity in figures with countries 
concerned. 
  2. Comparatively large added value of Chinese 
commodities in entrepot trade through Hong Kong expands trade 
statistic disparities with countries concerned. 
  Chinese commodities have comparatively large added value 
after entrepot trade through Hong Kong; information indicates 
that added value rates are higher than 50 percent. Because 
entrepot trade belongs to the category of third-country 
(region) trade activity, it does not cause "an increases or 
decreases in the quantity of material resources" of the 
exporting country (the UN definition of trade). Thus the added 
value portion is not entered into the trade statistics of the 
exporting country. However according to the importing country's 
origin standards, they are still considered to be commodities of 
China. Thus they actually are considered imports from China in 
importing country statistics, producing figure discrepancies. 
Chinese commodities transshipped via Hong Kong mainly are headed 
for the United States, Germany and Italy. It clearly is 
irrational that entrepot commodity added value artificially 
enlarges trade surplusses with these countries. 
  3. Suggestions for resolving the matter 
  Of the above two major causes for discrepancies in trade 
statistics between China and countries concerned, the 
producer-consumer country statistical accounting principle is 
the fundamental cause. The issue of bilateral trade statistic 
discrepancies presently complicates bilateral trade 
negotiations. It is imperative to resolve the issue. I believe 
that the following are considerations. 
  1. Reappraise standards for belonging to trade partnerships 
and select more scientific and rational statistical principles 
differing by country. Regarding trade partner countries, the 
United Nations book, Concepts of International Trade 
Statistics, notes that one can select country of origin, 
dispatch country, or country purchased from for imports, and 
consumer country, destination country or purchasing country for 
exports. For imports and exports together there are nine types 
of trade partnership country combinations in all. Except for 
"country purchased from/purchasing country," which is denied by 
the United Nations, all the other combinations are recommended 
by the United Nations. At present relatively many countries in 
theory use the "country of origin/country of consumption" 
principle because of economic system and trade management needs, 
ease of statistical accounting, or tradition. From the analysis 
above, it is evident that although the "country of 
origin/country of consumption" principle is convenient for trade 
management, it is harmful to international comparability of 
trade statistics. Moreover, 70 years have passed since proposal 
of this principle; it is unsuited to the contemporary 
ever-increasing growth of international entrepot trade. For 
export statistics of "country of consumption" in particular, 
since it is difficult to track and determine the country of 
consumption, actually some countries gradually have begun to use 
the "destination country" concept. That is, for imports they 
use country of origin and for exports, "destination country." 
However, this principle is unable to eliminate the matter of 
poor international comparability. Besides recording a country's 
international import and export situation, an important role of 
international trade statistics is in making international 
comparisons. At present the issue of international 
incomparability weakens the role of trade statistics. Thus it is 
necessary to reappraise and select criteria for belonging to 
trade partnerships. 
  Use of "dispatch country/destination country" criteria can 
eliminate the incomparability of international trade statistics. 
In the "dispatch country/destination country" principle, the 
first refers to the country which sends goods to an importing 
country under conditions where there is no intermediate 
commercial transaction whatsoever. Destination country refers 
to the ultimate destination of goods destined for export under 
conditions where there is no intermediate commercial transaction 
whatsoever. Arranging trade statistics by this principle accords 
with the United Nations' definition of international trade: 
namely, bringing about the movement of an increase or decrease 
of the stores of goods of a country (or region). According to 
the "dispatch country/destination country" principle, the 
importing and exporting countries of goods both can record the 
same transaction of goods. If an importing country resells the 
goods to a third country thereafter, the importing country and 
the third country both have a record. The third country's 
statistical information can reflect the entire course of the 
goods. In this way, both the import and export transactions of 
the goods can be accurately recorded, allowing rational 
comparability between the trade statistics of the exporting and 
importing countries. 
  3. The "dispatch country/destination country" statistical 
accounting principle should be used as soon as possible. After 
analysing and comparing several criteria for belonging to trade 
partnerships, I believe that this principle is most suited to 
international trade statistic comparisons. Use of the 
producer-consumer country principle to reflect trade surplus 
conditions between countries is unacceptable, incorrect and 
irrational. Use of the "dispatch country/destination country" 
principle can accurately reflect the international income and 
expenditure situation of a country or region. Basing trade 
statistics on it also is beneficial to bilateral trade 
negotiations. For example, if Chinese commodities are sent to 
Hong Kong, then China considers them Hong Kong export 
statistics. Hong Kong statistics will reflect if Hong Kong 
transports them to any country at any additional value. For 
example, if a Chinese commodity is sent on to the United States 
via Hong Kong, at 50 percent added value, Hong Kong uses the 
"dispatch country/destination country" statistical accounting 
principle as an export to the United States, tallying with that 
of the United States' imports from Hong Kong. Therefore, use of 
this principle should be established as soon as possible. It is 
beneficial to managing international trade affairs. Of course, 
simple use of the principle cannot meet the needs of managing 
imports. Thus, while using it as a basis for comparisons 
between countires, country of origin records also have to be 
kept as the basis for ways to manage implementation of trade. 
  4. Establish bilateral or multilateral trade statistic 
coordinating organizations. At present the trade statistic 
discrepancy issue exists worldwide. Most countries use the 
producer-consumer principle which lacks comparability. Each 
country steadfastly believes that its own statistical figures 
are correct and it is difficult to resolve the matter of 
different figures. Towards this end, some countries have 
established bilateral trade statistic coordinating 
organizations. For example, the United States and Canada, Japan, 
and the ROK. In particular the United States-Canadian 
coordinating organization is arranged very well; it has a nearly 
two decade operation and improvement. Bilateral or multilateral 
trade statistic coordinating organizations could be established 
to resolve the matter of discrepancies in trade statistics 
between China and relevant countries. Specific analyses and 
comparisons of these differences allow both sides to attain a 
common understanding.

<F P=106> [Article by Jiao Gang (3542 6921): "Proposals for New </F>
Nonstaple Food Production Bases in Yunnan"] 
  [Text] Rural productive forces in Yunnan have grown by 
leaps and bounds in th 14 years since reform began and the open 
policy went under way, basically solving the problem of hunger. 
However, the steady increase in urban population and the rising 
level of consumption among urban and rural households as well as 
changes in the mix of consumption have sharply boosted demand 
for meat, eggs, milk, fruits, and vegetables. The encroachment 
upon suburban land by ever-expanding cities, township and town 
enterprises, and assorted development zones has also severely 
weakened the ability of the outskirts to supply cities and 
industrial and mining areas with agricultural byproducts. The 
gap between the supply and demand of nonstaple food has widened. 
How to narrow this gap promptly and effectively has become a 
most urgent issue in social economic life in Yunnan. 
  The most fundamental way to ease the shortage of meat, eggs, 
milk, fruits, vegetables, and other nonstaple food is to develop 
a host of nonstaple food production bases with a steady supply 
capability. This is the new demand of high-quality, high-yield, 
and high-efficiency agriculture as well as an objective 
requirement of deepening rural reform in Yunnan and preventing a 
decline or instability in nonstaple food production in the 
outskirts of cities. The construction of nonstaple food bases is 
a piece of systems engineering that requires huge investments, 
is slow to take effect, and involves all sorts of factors, 
social, economic, and natural. Where should the bases be built? 
On what scale? What should they produce? What role should they 
play? What model should they follow? Where would the required 
funds and technology come from? How? These strategic questions 
pertaining to the construction of nonstaple food bases should 
all be answered based on the requirements of objective economic 
principles. The answers should have instructional significance 
and can be used as guiding principles on a macro level. 
  Considering the reality in Yunnan's development, we should 
build nonstaple food production bases along the rivers, along 
railroads, and along the border, selecting from among those 
areas designated by the state as key development zones, regional 
urban centers, and border trade development areas. [passages 
omitted] 
  Distribution of Nonstaple Food Production Bases 
  1) The model for the construction of nonstaple food 
production bases should be based on the specific conditions in 
Yunnan and chart a path with local Yunnan characteristics. The 
construction of production bases should be integrated with the 
development of a high-quality, high-yield, and high-efficiency 
agriculture in the outskirts. It should revolve around the 
modern suburban non-staple food production bases and be oriented 
toward the market. It should make use of science and technology 
and lead the peasants, special households, and Class 1 villages 
in creating a nonstaple food production base model that 
integrates agriculture closely with science, industry, and 
commerce (trade) and melds production, supply, and marketing 
into one. This development model has a dual function. On the one 
hand, it is open to the inluence of the urban economy, producing 
agricultural byproducts and supplying the cities with such 
byproducts. On the other hand, it serves peasants in the 
outskirts by organizing their production of nonstaple food and 
sharing their risk. 
  2) The Distribution of Nonstaple Food Production Bases: 
Basic 
Ideas 
  [Passage omitted] The concentric circle with the city at the 
center has indeed been the pattern of distribution of 
agricultural production bases both in China and elsewhere since 
ancient times. This gives the distribution of agricultural 
production the following characteristics. First, the 
agricultural population fans out from the city, losing in 
density the further you go from the center. Second, per capita 
farmland increases the further you go from the center. Third, 
the standard of agricultural production drops the further one 
moves from the center. Fourth, the degree of agricultural 
commercialization and the level of technology drop off. Fifth, 
an increasing percentage of the agricultural output is 
transported elsewhere to be sold. Sixth, the further from the 
center, the less polluted agricultural byproducts are. 
  Besides taking into account a variety of social, economic, 
and natural factors, we must also consider moving the point of 
lowest costs and site the bases at different levels based on the 
concentric circle pattern. 
  a) Bases for the production of meat, milk, and eggs as 
commodities in the outskirts. Expand, improve, and upgrade the 
existing pig bases at Fumin, Yiliang, and Jinning and the Fumin 
poultry and egg bases, turning them soon into pork, egg, and 
milk production bases in the outskirts that both are 
comprehensive and have their own respective focuses. In the wake 
of the development of the Kunming urban region and that of the 
Lanping lead and zinc mine, we should build three suburban meat, 
milk, and egg production bases one after another in the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan and the early part of the Ninth Five-Year Plan in 
order to satisfy the demand of Kunming, Dali, and the industrial 
and mining areas as well as the special needs of tourists. By 
the year 2000, the combined meat output of meat, milk, and egg 
production bases in the outskirts should be 99,000 tons, up 66.4 
percent from the level in 1990, for an average annual growth 
rate of 5.2 percent. Total annual milk output is projected to be 
66,000 tons, for an average annual growth rate of 6.8 percent. 
Combined annual egg output will be 17,000 tons, for an average 
annual growth rate of 4.3 percent. 
  B. Pork production bases in the outer suburbs and outside 
the 
cities. Further consolidate and improve the existing 17 
commercial pork producing base-counties. Then we should build 
on that achievement by gradually adjusting the distribution of 
the bases, shifting the focus to the southwestern and southern 
parts of the province and forming a cluster of bases to supply 
major cities including Kunming, Gejiu, and Qujing, and key 
opened tourist areas like Dali, Dehong, and Xishuangbanna with 
fresh products in the main, while putting equal emphasis on the 
production and supply of ham, juanti, and other specialty items. 
In addition, six pig bases including Simao, Jinghong, Binchuan, 
and Midu should be built in stages to serve the border ports and 
tourist areas. By the year 2000 base counties should have a 
total of 4,623,000 pigs in stock and produce 403,000 tons of 
pork, boosting the slaughter rate from 70 to 77 percent. 
  C. Beef production bases. Go all out to develop beef bases 
and beef, milk, and leather processing. This is where a 
breakthrough can be achieved to rationalize the structure of 
Yunnan's animal husbandry industry and create an export-oriented 
grain-conserving animal husbandry industry. Commercial beef 
bases should be concentrated in southern and central Yunnan, 
home to large numbers of Hui people. Special pains should be 
taken to develop beef bases in southwestern and southern Yunnan. 
After the five beef bases of Xindian, Nanjian, Weishan, 
Guangnan, and Funing are upgraded, 11 other bases should be 
built, including Eshan, Shizhong, Changning, Tengchong, 
Zhenxiong, and Zhaotong. They should orient themselves to 
Kunming and the neighboring areas and concentrate on the 
production of high-quality fresh beef, before gradually 
branching out into the processing business and developing 
specialty items for the domestic and overseas markets. By the 
year 2000, base counties should have 1,885,000 cattle on hand, 
up from the 1,626,000 in 1990, and slaughter 204,000 cattle, up 
from 63,000 in 1990. The annual beef output will also rise to 
9,500 tons by the year 2000, up from 2,800 tons. 
  D. Mutton bases. Mutton from Yunnan goats is quite popular 
in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and various Southeast Asian nations. The 
pace of building mutton bases should be accelerated. By the year 
2000, besides consolidating and improving the three bases of 
Shuangbai, Dayao, and Luquan, three other new bases --Chuxiong, 
Lengling, and Jingdong -- should be built gradually so that 
bases in central Yunnan produce black mutton while bases in 
Longling produce yellow mutton. Improve quality, better 
processing, and increase exports. By the year 2000, the bases 
should have 1,174,000 sheep on hand and slaughter 195,000 
animals annually, yielding 3,11 tons of mutton. 
  E. Dairy products base. Continue to build up the Eryuan cow 
milk base and Lunan milch goat base . Improve processing, 
packaging, and storage technologies. Work hard to increase the 
output of such specialty items as ruyan and milk biscuits, which 
are highly popular among consumers. Build Huaping and Jianchuan 
dairy bases. Open up a dairy products market in the industrial 
and mining areas centered on Pangang. By the year 2000, Eryuan 
and Huaping shall have a total of 36,000 milk cows on hand, 
producing 54,000 tons of milk and turning out enough cheese to 
meet the demand of the Kunming and Dali tourist areas. In 
addition, they shall gradually increase the output of a coherent 
series of dairy products and diligently cultivate the consumer 
markets in southwestern Yunnan and the neighboring countries. 
Between them Lunan and Jianchuan shall have 139,000 milk goats 
on hand, producing 3,800 tons of milk. Lunan County shall 
produce 550 tons of milk biscuits each year, its primary markets 
being Kunming and the Shilin tourist area. 
  F. Commercial poultry and egg bases. To make sure the needs 
of such key industrial and mining areas as Gejiu and Manwan are 
met, commercial poultry and egg bases will be built over time 
during the Eighth Five-Year Plan. By the year 2000 annual fresh 
egg output shall reach 838 tons and poultry, 1,435 tons. 
  G. Distribution of vegetable bases. There are four basic 
considerations behind the distribution of vegetable bases. 
First, consolidate and improve the old bases outside Kunming, 
Dongchuan, Dali, Chixiong, and Yuxi, creating specialized 
production bases of an appropriate scale which concentrate on 
upscale niche vegetables and other out-of-season vegetables. 
Second, in the short haul outer suburbs and mid-range suburbs 
should specialize in vegetables with a mass demand. Third, 
places in the periphery of Kunming like Tonghai, Yuanjiang, 
Yuanmou, and Binchuan should set up a number of export-oriented 
vegetable production and processing bases, focusing on early 
winter vegetables. Fourth, build vegetable bases along the 
rivers, along railroads, and along the border, in other words, 
namely the main paths of growth in the province in the future. 
  a) Develop new specialized commercial vegetable production 
bases with a combined area of 70,000 mu at such points as 
Baoshan, Tengchong, Luxi, Lanping, Yunlong, Yun County, Jinggu, 
and Simao in the Lancang valley. The average yield per mu shall 
be 2,000 kilograms. Required investment: 28 million yuan. 
  b) Build new bases in Yuanjiang, Tonghai, and Dongchuan with 
a combined area of 5,000 mu to develop improved vegetable 
varieties. They shall supply 2,400 tons of improved vegetable 
varieties each year and 1 ton of hybrid seeds. Required 
investment: 6 million yuan. 
  c) It will require an investment of 6 million yuan to 
improve 
and consolidate 30,000 mu of newly opened vegetable growing 
areas near the central cities in central and eastern Yunnan 
along the Nanning-Kunming Railroad and Kunming-Hekou Railroad. 
  H. The distribution of fruit production bases. In the future 
fruit production bases should be clustered around the key 
regions--central cities, key development zones--and be built in 
stages. 
  Stage 1 (1993-1995): 1.5 million mu under fruit cultivation 
(including 600,000 mu under joint commodity production). Of the 
total output of 450,000 tons, commercial output accounts for 
150,000 tons, or 12 kilograms per capita. 
  Stage 2 (1996-2000). Between 2 million and 2.2 million mu 
are 
under fruit cultivation (including 1 million mu under joint 
commodity production). Of the total output of 800,000 tons, 
commercial output makes up 400,000 tons, or 21 kilograms per 
capita, which would place Yunnan near the national average. 
  Build a million mu of high-quality high-yield orchards by 
the 
year 2000 through the distribution of different varieties in 
different stages and at different levels. Create a mango belt, 
the largest in the nation, based on Yuanjiang and Xinping in the 
upper and middle reaches of Hong He; a banana belt, based on 
Hekou, Hong He, and Yuanyang in the lower reaches of Hong He; an 
apple belt, based on Ningliang, Lijiang, and Zhaotong in 
northwestern and northeastern Yunnan; an orange and tangerine 
belt, based on Huaning, Jianshui, Luxi, and Shiping in 
Nanpanjiang; and a high-quality pear and peach belt, based on 
Kunming, Chuxiong, and Dali. This will put an end to the 
fragmentation that characterizes fruit growing in Yunnan and 
allows large quantities of marketable fruit to make their way 
from the valleys to the market. Right now the people of Yunnan, 
blessed as they are with ample natural resources, eat Shandong 
apples, Hebei pears, and sweet oranges from Guangdong. The 
build-up of fruit production bases should change that situation 
fundamentally. 
  a) Special aquatic breeding bases. We should be realistic 
enough to see that as an inland province, Yunnan has limited 
potential in the aquatic industry. Its future here lies in 
intelligent distribution and in concentrating on the development 
of a number of high-value and sophisticated special, unique or 
rare aquatic products, thus offsetting its quantitative weakness 
with high-quality, well-priced, and unusual products and 
creating a new look in aquatic production. Bases for the 
production of soft-shelled turtle, lobster, river crab, 
California perch, rainbow trout, and bullfrog may be built in 
places like Kunming, Xishuangbanna, Hekou, Yuanyang, and Dehong. 
These bases should operate on a substantial scale and orient 
themselves to such markets as those in Kunming, key port cities, 
and other provinces. 
  3. Strategy for the Construction of Nonstaple Food 
Production 
Bases 
  1) Adopt new thinking. Right now vegetable production and 
sales are booming. We should take advantage of this momentum 
and, making the best use of the situation, promptly adjust our 
guiding principle by adopting unequivocally a new philosophy for 
the development of the vegetable industry. Raise the standing of 
vegetables in the urban and rural economies, particularly the 
latter. Remove vegetable growing from diversified operations and 
turn it into an independent industry in its own right on a par 
with grain growing, animal husbandry, and township and town 
enterprises. That will increase to four the number of major 
players in the rural economy in many counties and municipalities 
in the outskirts of cities: enterprises, grain, animal 
husbandry, and vegetables. Localities with the necessary 
wherewithal may go into the timber industry, fruit growing, and 
fish breeding, diversifying their economies in the course of 
time. 
  2) Strengthen the market mechanism. For one thing, we must 
organize the production and sales of vegetables, fruit, aquatic 
products, and other nonstaple food based on what the market 
wants, adhering firmly to the direction of upgrading. Guided by 
the new work philosophy, the departments concerned must provide 
peasants who grow vegetables and fruit with accurate information 
and comprehensive coordinated services in technological matters, 
transportation, and storage. This is essential to building a 
base-county. Secondly, an effort should be made to ensure 
success in superstructure construction by setting up a host of 
new high-standard large-scale special markets and wholesale 
markets. In the course of time there should be a nonstaple food 
market system that is intelligently distributed, well-equipped, 
easily accessible, and scientifically managed. We should work to 
make it more and more appealing and influential. Thirdly, we 
should go all out to open up the markets in other cities and 
then move into Southeast Asia, securing for ourselves a foothold 
in the international market. 
  3) Sources of funding for base construction. Nonstaple food 
base construction is characterized by the large amount of 
investment required over a long period of time. Accordingly what 
is needed is a sound investment policy with diversified funding 
sources. Some of the inputs should come from the state, some 
from the producers, and some from the consumers as well. The 
enthusiasm of the state, localities, local peasants, and all 
social quarters for base construction should be fully tapped. 
Initially, money for base construction may come from these 
possible source: a) Appropriations by the local government; b) 
appropriations by the central treasury; c) bank loans; d) 
fund-raising by peasants; e) idle funds in all social quarters 
in the city; f) foreign funds. At the moment, the state and 
local governments are the main financiers of the construction of 
non-staple food bases. However, this uniform pattern of funding 
does nothing to accelerate the building of new bases. Of the 
funding sources mentioned above, the most ignored hitherto are 
e) and f). As the open policy is broadened, foreign capital has 
also become an important source of funds to build nonstaple food 
bases in key areas. In addition, expanding lateral economic 
cooperation between different sectors and regions in funding, 
technology, qualified personnel, and commodities that is 
mutually beneficial and that is complementary is also an 
effective way to solve problem relating to funds, technology, 
and qualified personnel that may occur in base development. 
  4) Adopt a business and management model that integrates 
agriculture with trade and industry. Traditionally the 
agricultural sector was solely concerned with production; no 
external environment and basic conditions for participating in 
processing and circulation existed. Even as they overhaul their 
thinking, therefore, base-counties must work extra hard to 
integrate agriculture with industry and trade and branch out 
into non-staple food processing and circulation. Leading bodies 
at all levels should encourage and support their subordinate 
units in operations linking production and marketing. The 
primary processing, multiple processing, and other forms of 
sophisticated processing of nonstaple food allied to the raw 
materials products of a base should be tackled energetically, as 
should the development of foreign-exchange-earning and 
export-oriented agriculture and processing. The leading 
departments should also guide the entry of these units into the 
circulation arena, add value to nonstaple food without 
interruption, and increase the incomes of peasants and herdsmen. 
For a province like Yunnan with its underdeveloped commodity 
economy these issues assume additional urgency and importance. 
  5) Step up the macro-regulation and control of bases. The 
construction of nonstaple food bases is critical to upgrading 
Yunnan's food industry and satisfying the market demand in the 
1990's. After we have planned their distribution intelligently, 
conducted scientific verification, and incorporated them into 
national economic construction in stages, we should step up 
close leadership in earnest and strengthen macro regulation and 
control. First, project management should be adopted for every 
kind of nonstaple food base. A project should be approved only 
after rigorous examination. Project management methods should 
also be worked out. Input and output should be strictly linked. 
Inspection should be tightened and evaluation methods should be 
formulated. After a project is completed, it should be inspected 
before acceptance. Group contracting should be adopted for 
comprehensive development projects, bringing together the 
leaders, technical cadres, and the masses. Inputs like 
policies, technology, funds, and materials should be coordinated 
and services rendered in a coherent manner. Responsibility 
contracts should be signed at each level and scientific and 
technical contracting should be adopted, thus linking wages and 
bonuses to how well or how poorly a job is done, 
responsibilities to rights and profits. Scientific and technical 
contracting should be used to widen income differences; S&amp;T 
personnel with outstanding contributions should be heavily 
rewarded. Where a project is poorly executed or funds have been 
wasted, the leaders and other individuals involved should be 
held liable. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Shanghai, May 14 (XINHUA) -- Charities have staged 
a comeback in China after a lapse of two decades. 
  Recently, the official PEOPLE'S DAILY carried an article to 
say that charity is no longer a forbidden word, indicating an 
immediate development of charities in the country. 
  Shanghai, the country's biggest metropolis, established its 
charity foundation earlier this week, following the first 
non-governmental charity organization, which was set up in 
northeast China's Liaoning Province. 
  The focus of attention even in its preparatory period, the 
foundation received six million yuan in donations through 
various channels in a week prior to its founding. 
  Two brothers from east China's Anhui Province have 
contributed 3,700 yuan to the foundation, which they were 
awarded for responding courageously to save drowning people. 
  Charity campaigns have swung through the country since last 
year. 
  When a helping-the-orphans event was initiated in Hangzhou 
City in east China's Zhejiang Province, over 7,000 people swung 
into action, donating a million yuan and adopting more than 50 
homeless children. 
  In the capital Beijing, hospitals sponsored a "love and 
health" activity, giving free treatment and operations to 24 
orphans. 
  This year, Shanghai has launched several projects to extend 
a 
warm hand to the disabled, residents in poverty and homeless 
children. Now, there are about 32,000 such people under social 
care. 
  Many people consider charities to be noble endeavors which 
mark civilized society, especially in China, a country with the 
largest population of 1.2 billion and one of the fastest growing 
economies in the world.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhi (3769 5365): "CPC Newspapers, Journals </F>
Lose More Than 100 Million Yuan"] 
  [Text] At the beginning of each year, the CPC department 
concerned would, as a rule, review the work on party newspapers 
and journals. This year is no exception. As early as 17 January, 
the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee [CPCCC] 
issued a circular to all units around the country, under the 
title "Suggestions on Recommending Newspapers and Journals for 
Study by Party Organizations." The fact that the party media 
have to be "recommended" to party organizations by the CPCCC 
Propaganda Department shows that the party's mouthpiece cannot 
get a foothold on the market and must be supported by an 
administrative order. 
<H5>  Declining Circulations of Party Newspapers and Journals </H5>
  As revealed by the Information Office of the State 
Council, the circulations of party newspapers and journals have 
plummeted since last year when the State Council stipulated that 
personal subscriptions to such papers and journals be paid at 
personal expense. In general, the circulations of party and 
government journals at the central and local levels have fallen 
by 15 percent--in some cases, the drop has exceeded 50 percent. 
Statistic figures show that the annual loss suffered by 
newspapers and journals published by central and local 
government and party departments has totaled some 135 million 
yuan. 
  The Chinese Communists once elatedly boasted that RENMIN 
RIBAO was the paper with the largest circulation in the world. 
In fact, the paper is financially supported by the state coffer. 
Organs like RENMIN RIBAO are synonymous with "public 
newspapers." Without doubt, the "subscription at personal 
expense" stipulation, which went into effect last year, has 
served as the best public opinion poll [about people's 
confidence in the party media]. The over 135 million yuan loss 
is by no means a small amount; it is sufficient to send the 
press magnate of any country into bankruptcy. To the CPC, which 
maintains a one-party rule in China, however, the concern is not 
the huge loss of money, but the loss of public confidence in the 
party media as indicated by the sharp drop in their 
circulations. Such being the case, it is no matter of surprise 
that the CPCCC Propaganda Department has come out to act as a 
"recommender" for the party media. 
  The CPCCC Propaganda Department's circular requests that 
party organizations at all levels take it as the party's 
principal propaganda work to promote the study and reading of 
newspapers and journals so as to understand and get a grip on 
important domestic affairs and gain knowledge about major 
international events. According to the circular, party 
organizations should give periodical written tests to cadres 
with party membership to check their knowledge about major 
domestic and international events and use the test results as 
one of the criteria for their promotion or job assignment. Every 
member of the party organization, the circular urges, must 
subscribe to a party newspaper or journal. In remote areas, 
every village party organization and county propaganda 
department is responsible for subscribing a party newspaper and 
making arrangements for party members to study it on a regular 
basis. 
  While the CPCCC Propaganda Department has issued numerous 
orders in the past to urge party organizations at all levels to 
give attention to political study, never before has it required 
that cadres with party membership take a "written test" on the 
contents of party newspapers and that the test results be used 
as one of the criteria for "promotion." There is, indeed, some 
reason for doing this, but it cannot be said openly. 
<H5>  Real Situation of Circulations and Expenditures of the `Two </H5>
Newspapers and One Journal' 
  Besides the CPCCC Propaganda Department's circular, the 
Information Office of the State Council also issued on 24 
January a circular entitled "On Seriously Promoting the Work of 
All Media-Distribution and Publication Departments." The 
Information Office is quite clear about the concrete statistics 
on the distribution and publication of the party media. In 
addition to the above-mentioned annual loss of some 135 million 
yuan, there are many more figures, which are considered as 
"state secrets." Following are the real situation of 
circulations and expenditures of the "two newspapers and one 
journal" at the central level: 
  RENMIN RIBAO (Domestic Edition): The daily circulation in 
1992 was about 2.3 million. In 1993, the circulation was only 
1.65 million, down by 28 percent, and the excess expenditure 
amounted to some 8.3 million yuan. 
  GUANGMING RIBAO: The daily circulation in 1992 was about 
1.5 million. In 1993, this dropped to 850,000, down by 43 
percent, and the excess expenditure was some 3.1 million yuan. 
  QIUSHI magazine: In 1992, each issue had a circulation of 
about 1.5 million. In 1993, the figure dropped to 1.1 million, 
down by 27 percent, and the excess expenditure was more than 
860,000 yuan. 
  In comparison, the mainland's evening papers have a rather 
stable circulation because their contents are richer and more 
"liberal." A survey shows that the daily circulations of 
government and party newspapers and journals in the nation's 30 
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have dropped 
15 percent--in some cases more than 50 percent--with the 
exception of nine newspapers and journals including XINMIN 
WANBAO in Shanghai, YANGCHENG WANBAO in Guangdong, BEIJING 
WANBAO in Beijing, and CHENGDU WANBAO in Sichuan. More than 50 
party organs at the provincial level have excess expenditures. 
On the average, the excess expenditure is as high as more than 
60 percent. 
<H5>  Circulation of CANKAO XIAOXI Plummets </H5>
  What is worth mentioning is that CANKAO XIAOXI, the 
largest circulation publication in the country, was once widely 
received by readers as the only "other information source" under 
the CPC's information-blockade policy. During the past decade, 
however, its circulation has nose-dived, from 25 million in 1982 
to 16 million in 1988 and then to 8 million in 1993. The fall 
was 68 percent compared with the peak attained 11 years ago. 
  The declined circulation has worsened the problem of 
excess expenditures. For example, the three news agencies 
XINHUA, ZHONGXIN, and ZHONGTONG have an average excess 
expenditure of more than 60 million yuan [figure as published]. 
This does not include the special funds that the State Council 
has allocated to them for the purchase of supplies and 
communications equipment and for various large-scale activities. 
Specific figures follow: 
<H5>  Three Official News Agencies Have Excess Expenditure of 60 </H5>
Million Yuan [as published] 
  In 1993, the official XINHUA News Agency had an 
expenditure of 87 million yuan, showing an excess of some 13 
million yuan. 
  In 1993, ZHONGGUO XINWEN had an expenditure of 42 million 
yuan, showing an excess of some 8.6 million yuan. 
  In 1993, ZHONGGUO TONGXUN had an expenditure of 60 million 
yuan, showing an excess of some 9.7 million yuan. 
  Of the three news agencies, ZHONGXIN had the smallest 
excess expenditure. In addition to the above, there is a 
"record-breaking" figure: The Xinhua Bookstore's total sales of 
political and theoretical books throughout the country was 
305,000 books in 1993 (excluding My Father--Deng 
Xiaoping and Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, 
Volume III), hitting a record low since the founding of the 
People's Republic. More than 1.8 million books on politics were 
sold in 1950. The highest record was registered in 1967, when 
3.25 billion political and theoretical books were sold. 
  A low circulation--a high expenditure; a decline in 
circulation--a still higher expenditure. It seems that the CPC 
mouthpiece can hardly get out of this difficulty at the moment. 
Even the measure of linking party newspapers to promotions and 
pay raises will not produce any result. This is a disastrous 
effect of separating economic reform from political reform. Just 
think: When people are enjoying every day the material life 
created by capitalism, how could they believe the party's 
stereotyped propaganda that "only socialism can save China"?

<F P=106> ["Work Report of Jiangxi Provincial Higher People's Court </F>
Delivered by Li Xiuyuan (2621 0208 3293) at the Second Session 
of the Eighth Jiangxi Provincial People's Congress on 27 
February 1994"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] I. Deal Severe Blows at 
Serious Criminal and Economic Cases, Safeguard Social Stability 
and Wage Struggles against Corruption 
  Social stability is the necessary pre-requisite and 
guarantee to promoting the reform and opening-up program and 
developing economic construction. To punish criminals according 
to law, safeguard social stability and create a fine social 
environment for developing the reform and opening-up program and 
economic construction is the major responsibility of the 
people's court. The courts at all levels in the province had 
continued to implement the principle of "dealing heavy blows at 
criminal offenses" and persistently and unflinching waged 
struggles to strike at heinous criminals. In 1993, Jiangxi had 
handled 9,426 criminal cases of the first instance and completed 
9,304 of them. Among the 12,807 criminal offenders to whom 
judgments have already become effective, 33.8 percent of them 
were sentenced to more than five years of fixed imprisonment, 
life imprisonment or death (including death penalty with a 
suspension of execution); 65.5 percent of them were sentenced to 
less than five years of fixed-term imprisonment, criminal 
retention and public surveillance or given exemption from 
criminal sanctions; and 0.7 percent of them were found not 
guilty. 
  In their struggle against crimes which seriously endanger 
public security, the courts at all levels paid attention to the 
following work: 
  1. They concentrated their efforts on handling major cases. 
They promptly handled, from the beginning to the end, those 
criminal cases involving killing, robbery, kidnapping, rape and 
hooligan activities, particularly major crimes committed by 
criminal gangs. In all the criminal cases completed in 1993, 
43.8 percent or 4,081 cases and 63 percent or 7,856 criminals 
were involved in the aforementioned offenses. 
  2. They continued to coordinate with relevant departments 
to vigorously wage struggles against larceny, train and highway 
robberies, abducting and selling children, forcing women into 
prostitution. Proceeding from reality, various localities dealt 
heavy blows to those crimes on the priority list, and attained 
remarkable results. In 1993, Jiangxi handled 652 cases involving 
larceny and prosecuted 1,048 suspects; 282 cases involving the 
"six evils" and prosecuted 414 offenders; and handled 303 cases 
involving train and highway robberies and prosecuted 831 
offenders. 
  3. They strengthened their forces to strike at criminal 
activities, and persistently followed the principle of meting 
out severe and swift punishment to criminals who serious 
endangered public security. About 94 percent of the cases 
wounded up in 1993 were completed within the legally prescribed 
time limits. The number of heinous criminals sentenced to more 
than five years of fixed-term imprisonment or death penalty rose 
8.4 percent in 1993. 
  To deal heavy blows at criminals is an important aspect of 
the struggle waged by the people's courts against criminal 
activities. Economic crimes seriously jeopardized the ties of 
the party and government with the masses, hindered the reform 
and opening up program and interfered with economic 
construction. The courts at all levels in the province had 
continued to regard the struggle to strike at criminal crimes as 
something of great significance in combating corruption, in 
keeping a honest and clean government and in promoting economic 
development. They firmly adhered to the principle of severely 
punishing serious economic offenders in accordance with law. In 
1993, people's courts in Jiangxi had accepted 990 economic cases 
of the first instance publicly prosecuted by the procuratorial 
organs, and completed 944 of them. Except those cases for which 
appeals were being lodged and those which were sent back to 
procuratorial organs for reinvestigation or withdrawal, actions 
taken against 1,865 offenders had already become legally 
effective, of whom 765 were sentenced to more than five years of 
fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment and death, 1,100 of 
them were sentenced to less than five years of fixed-term 
imprisonment, criminal retention and public surveillance, 114 
were exempted from criminal sanctions and 23 of them were found 
not guilty. Among the criminals convicted, 197 committed 
offenses involving more than 10,000 yuan each and 56 committed 
crimes involving over 100,000 yuan each. A total of 5.91 million 
yuan of economic losses were recovered for the state. 
  In order to further intensify the struggle against 
corruption, the people's courts in the province had persistently 
struck at corrupt state functionaries who accepted bribery and 
engaged in embezzlement. They resolutely meted out punishment on 
this type of offenses as soon as the cases were accepted by the 
court and the suspects were proved guilty. In 1993, Jiangxi 
completed 149 cases of the first instance involving corruption, 
bribery and embezzlement, accounting for 16 percent of all the 
criminal cases. Two hundred fifteen offenders were convicted 
including eight county and department-level cadres. At the same 
time, actions were taken to severely deal with smugglers, 
swindlers and tax dodgers and those who faked trademarks; sold 
and manufactured fake and shoddy merchandise; and seriously 
undermined the economic order. In 1993, Jiangxi had concluded 
109 trials of the aforementioned category, and convicted 184 
offenders whose sentences had already become legally effective. 
In dealing with offenses of this category, other punishments 
such as imposing fines, confiscating properties and others were 
also meted out along with other severe punishments so as to 
prevent the criminals from reaping economic benefits. 
  After the arrangements were made by the second plenary 
session of the CPC Central Discipline Inspection Commission for 
the anti-corruption struggle in August 1993, the courts at 
various levels in the province had exerted even greater efforts 
in striking at economic crimes. They strengthened their efforts 
to handle the major cases exposed in the anti-corruption 
struggle and completed the trials in a timely manner, once the 
procuratorial organs started the prosecution procedure. They 
paid full attention to facts and the evidence and handled all 
cases in accordance with law. They closely followed the 
principle of "being firm, prudent and accurate," and ensured 
that all cases were handled properly and carefully. From 
September to December 1993, Jiangxi had accepted and concluded 
517 economic cases, up 90 cases over the same period in 1992. 
There were 133 major cases involving corruption, bribery and 
embezzlement for which 11 criminals were sentenced to more than 
10 years of fixed-term imprisonment; two of them to life 
imprisonment and another two to the death penalty with a 
suspension of execution. In addition, two of the criminals were 
sentenced to death, pending the approval of the Supreme People's 
Court. In order to meet the requirements set by the central 
authorities and the provincial CPC committee to attain 
achievements against corruption in different stages in the near 
future, the people's courts in various localities held 
sentence-pronouncing rallies during which verdicts were passed 
on a group of major criminal offenders involving corruption, 
bribery and embezzlement. At the end of 1993, the provincial 
people's court had taken an unified action to pronounce 
sentences on a number of major cases which attracted widespread 
attention of the general public. It made a province-wide group 
announcement in public and even held a news briefing in this 
connection. It created a great impact and good social effects on 
the society. 
<H5>  II. Regulate Economic Relations in Accordance With Law, </H5>
Actively Serve Macro-Control and Develop Market Economy 
  In the course of promoting the national economy with a high 
speed last year, there emerged some contradictions and problems 
in China's economic life. Some of them were quite outstanding. 
The party CPC Committee made a timely policy decision to 
strengthen and improve the macro-economic control. In order to 
ensure the smooth implementation of the major policy decision 
made by the central authorities and maintain the normal economic 
order, the people's courts at various levels throughout the 
province adopted effective measures to vigorously strengthen 
their efforts in trying cases involving economic crimes. In 
1993, they handled a total of 38,285 economic cases of the first 
instance with a total amount of 966 million yuan involved, up 
35.7 percent and 129 percent respectively over 1992. 
  We had paid particular attention to handling the following 
types of cases. 
  1) We actively handled cases involving state-owned 
enterprises which were changing the way they operated; 
protected, in accordance with law, the legal interests of the 
enterprises and the managing companies by trying cases which 
involved contracting, leasing, joint operation, merging, 
shareholding and bankruptcy procedures for various enterprises. 
We had helped enterprises change the way their operated and 
establish a modern enterprise system; and provided them with the 
legal protection to become market-oriented. In 1993, Jiangxi had 
handled a total of 1,204 cases of the aforementioned nature, 
accounting for 3.2 percent of the total number of cases handled. 
  2) We concentrated our efforts in handling cases involving 
marketing, money-borrowing, financing, investment in 
shareholding form, patent, trademark and disputes over 
technological contracts; and helped improve the markets for 
merchandise, funds and technologies. In 1993, Jiangxi had 
handled 26,086 cases of this category, accounting for 68 percent 
of the total number of cases handled. Many of the cases were of 
a new variety. With the rapid development of the reform program 
in China and the legislature lagging hind, the courts in various 
localities extensively conducted investigation and studies, 
continuously summed up their experiences, and followed the basic 
principle that they applied laws whenever there were laws in 
this connection. They applied the policy whenever there are no 
laws or regulations in this connection. They acted in accordance 
with the basic principle of the law when both the law and the 
policy in this connection were not so clear. We persistently 
handled cases in accordance with the principle of the "three 
conducive's." 
  3) We properly handled cases concerning the development of 
rural economy. In 1993, Jiangxi had handled 2,161 cases 
involving disputes over the rural contract system, up 3.4 
percent over 1992. At the same time, we had also handled a large 
number of economic disputes among rural enterprises. By means of 
various adjudicative activities, we had safeguarded the 
household contract responsibility system, helped rural 
enterprises improve their management and invigorated the rural 
economy in an overall manner. 
  In order to keep pace with the new situation in economic 
development and satisfy the growing needs for the judicial 
sector to serve the market economy, the people's courts at 
various levels had improved their services and their work, and 
provided legal consultations for the development of economic 
construction. They adopted the following measures: 
  1. They carried out specialized judicial work in 
coordination with the macro-control. They took the initiative to 
help the financial sector collect its loans in accordance with 
law, support the tax authorities to levy taxes and assist the 
land office and the transportation department to collect 
necessary fees. They also helped the various enterprises clear 
up their debts, assisted people settle their economic disputes, 
and helped maintain the normal economic order. 
  2. They simplified the litigation procedure and raise their 
efficiency in handling cases. They vigorously carried out their 
mediation work, provided supervision and ensured that all legal 
procedures were properly followed. They made efforts to reduce 
some unnecessary steps in lawsuit. In 1993, 69.1 percent of the 
cases involving economic disputes were concluded through 
mediation. The various basic-level people's courts handled 
12,011 cases involving simple economic disputes. 
  3. They took the initiative to provide legal services in 
various enterprises and economic departments at the latter's 
doorsteps. They sometimes set up liaison offices or send out 
tribunals to help enterprises and the departments concerned 
clear up their debts, settle economic disputes, become more 
competitive on the market, train people to handle legal affairs, 
run business in accordance with law. Their measures taken were 
warmly praised by the enterprises and the departments concerned. 
<H5>  III. Correctly and Properly Handle Civil and Administrative </H5>
Cases; and Protect legal Rights and Interests of citizens, Legal 
Persons and Other Organizations in Accordance With Law 
  To protect the legal rights and interests of citizens and 
legal persons from encroachment is an important aspect of 
socialist democracy and the legal system. To correctly and 
timely handle civil and administrative cases is of great 
significance in maintaining social stability, promoting 
production and developing spiritual civilization. 
  Civil rights are basic rights of the citizens and legal 
persons. With more changes taking place in society and people's 
mind and with the rapid development of the market economy, 
contacts among the people have become closer, and there are more 
civil cases for the people's courts to handle. Particularly with 
the continuous development of the legal relations in civil 
affairs, the number of cases involving properties and individual 
rights and interests is on the increase every year. The work in 
handling civil cases has become more closely related with 
economic construction, especially with the development of the 
market economy. In 1993, Jiangxi had concluded 66,521 civil 
cases of the first instance, up 32.1 percent over 1992. It had 
placed emphasis on handling civil cases of the following 
categories: 
  1) It handled many civil cases involving marriage and family 
problems. For many years in the past, the number of divorce 
cases ranked top among all the civil cases handled. In 1993, 
Jiangxi had concluded 23,252 cases of this category. With the 
changes of the people's concept on marriage, family and 
property, not only the number of divorce cases is increasing, 
there are more problems in dividing properties, child-care and 
housing allotment. The people's courts properly handled divorce 
cases in strict accordance with the Marriage Law, and helped 
strengthen the socialist system about marriage and family. 
  2) It energetically handled trials concerning liabilities, 
real estate and labor disputes. With the vigorous development of 
the reform and opening-up program and the booming economic 
activities within the nongovernment sector, there were 
increasing number of disputes concerning debts, real estate and 
labor. In 1993, Jiangxi had concluded 13,172 cases concerning 
debts, 894 cases on houses and 465 cases involving labor 
disputes. By handling trials of these categories, the people's 
courts had made the money, real estate and labor markets 
flourish. 
  3) It had properly handled civil cases involving disputes on 
land, forest, water conservancy, ownership of or the rights to 
use plots for housing projects. In 1993, Jiangxi concluded 330 
cases of this category. Most of these cases were in the rural 
areas. They directly affected production and livelihood of the 
masses, and at times, problems became quite serious. By properly 
handling such cases, the people's courts had timely solved the 
problems, eliminated the factors of instability, helped maintain 
social stability in rural areas and promoted agricultural 
production. 
  The trial of administrative cases is an important step in 
developing the socialist democratic politics. Since the official 
enactment of the "Administrative Procedure Law of the People's 
Republic of China" on 1 October 1990, the work of administrative 
trials has entered a new stage in Jiangxi. The number of 
administrative lawsuits was on the increase every year, and the 
scope of litigation is continuously expanding. In 1993, Jiangxi 
had handled 805 administrative cases, up 21.9 percent over 1992. 
It had concluded 786 cases in which the ruling of the 
administrative organization was upheld in 33 percent of the 
cases, annulled in 20 percent of the cases, and changed in 2.2 
percent of the cases. The plaintiffs withdrew suits in 35.8 
percent of the cases. In addition, 1,744 cases were handled 
involving a total amount of 2.43 million yuan, whereas 
administrative organs had requested that judgements be forcibly 
executed. 
  In the course of handling administrative lawsuits, the 
people's courts not only protected, in accordance with law, the 
legal interests of the citizens and legal persons and other 
organizations, but also helped and supervised the administrative 
organs to exercise their functions and powers. They mainly paid 
attention to the following tasks: 
  1. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases 
involving enterprises' autonomy in management, preventing others 
from infringing upon the rights of the enterprises, safeguarding 
their market share and interests and helping them change the way 
they operate. 
  2. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases which 
involved land, industrial and commercial administration, 
taxation, finance, foreign exchange, commodity price and 
technological supervision and management, and in maintaining 
order for market competition. Meanwhile, they thwarted improper 
actions of the administrative organizations and other illegal 
administrative measures which undermined the economy, punished 
the enterprises without the proper authority, indiscriminately 
meting out punishments, recklessly set up roadblocks, collected 
excessive fees, and illegally increase peasants' burdens. 
  3. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases which 
involved public security, shelter and surveillance, re-education 
through labor and infringement of citizens' rights. They 
protected, in accordance with law, the interests of the 
citizens; eliminated the sense of antagonism between the 
administrative organizations and the public; and reduced the 
factors of social instability. 
  4. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases whereas 
the administrative organs had requested that judgments be 
executed by force, supported administrative organs in carrying 
out their work and help them maintain their administrative 
authority. Cases involving the execution of administrative 
orders often aroused major public interests, involved the 
overall situation of state administration, and directly affected 
economic construction and social stability. In handing cases of 
this category, the people's courts had persistently followed the 
principle of being vigorous, reliable and safe. They not only 
dared to help administrative organs implement their orders, but 
also carried out a great deal of publicity, re-education and 
persuasion work to help ease contradictions. 
  During the past year, Jiangxi had steadily and continuously 
extended their legal services in handling administrative 
lawsuits. However, the system of administrative lawsuits had not 
been established too long, the people's courts were still 
unfamiliar with lawsuits of this category, and some of the 
judicial cadres who handle such cases still showed sentiments of 
fearing difficulties. Therefore, to further study, popularize 
and implement the Law of Administrative Procedure remains an 
important task in the near future. The people's courts at 
various levels are earnestly summing up their experiences, 
overcoming difficulties, continuously improving the environment 
in enforcing this law and marching forward in handling 
administrative lawsuits. 
<H5>  IV. Rely on Judicial Work, Actively Improve All Facets of </H5>
Public Security in Society 
  To improve all facets of public security in the society is a 
basic policy in maintaining a lasting order in our country. It 
also represents a basic principle of Chinese characteristics in 
doing our judicial work. In handling trials of all types over 
the past year, the people's courts at various levels throughout 
the country paid attention to performing their functions well in 
carrying out their judicial work, and energetically improved all 
the facets of public security in society. They mainly performed 
the following duties: 
  1) They persistently held open trials, gave widespread 
publicity to the socialist legal system and called on people to 
observe discipline and abide by laws. The courts in the province 
held a total 465 rallies to announce judgments with a total 
audience of 3.12 million people in the last year. 
  2) In the course of dealing with the lawsuits, they also 
made judicial suggestions. When they tried cases of various 
categories, they discovered that some departments and units had 
many loopholes and problems in their management system. In light 
of these loopholes and problems, they made judicial suggestions. 
In 1993, Jiangxi had made 3,576 judicial suggestions, a great 
majority of which were accepted by the units concerned. It had 
attained remarkable social effects. 
  3) They strengthened their work for juvenile courts. They 
meted out appropriate penalties on young criminals, while 
protecting the legal rights and interests of the juvenile 
delinquents. Meanwhile some juvenile courts also sponsored study 
classes and parents' schools to educate juvenile delinquents by 
persuasion and prevent them from committing crimes again. 
  4) Proceeding from the desire to reform juvenile delinquents 
and prevent them from committing crimes once again, they often 
reduced their sentences, put them on probation or released them 
on parole in accordance with law. In 1993, Jiangxi reduced 
sentences in 6,490 cases, released 553 juvenile delinquents on 
parole and put 1,888 of them on probation, accounting for 15 
percent of the total number of delinquents. A system was set up 
in many localities to visit juvenile delinquents on probation or 
parole after they were released. The juvenile courts also 
coordinated with the departments concerned and the basic-level 
organizations to help those on parole or probation to reform and 
educate themselves. 
  5) They carried out their mass work well inside and outside 
the courts, and correctly used legal means to solve various 
kinds of contradictions. The people's courts at various levels 
paid full attention to enhancing social stability; implemented 
the policy of correctly handling the contradictions among the 
people; and used this policy to guide their judicial work. The 
civil and administrative lawsuits involve many aspects and are 
closely related with the masses. Through these civil and 
administrative cases, the people's courts understood the 
situation in the community well, made preparations way ahead to 
help various departments concerned solve various contradictions 
and problems. In handling civil and administrative lawsuits, the 
people's courts in the province continued to uphold the 
principle of conducting mediation to solve disputes, always 
tried to reason things with both parties in dispute and helped 
them to accommodate each other and reach agreement on their own 
accord, to end their disputes and to avoid the accumulation of 
contradictions. [passage omitted]

economic and social development are achieving important results. 
The main purpose of the congress is to make the theory of 
constructing a socialism with Chinese characteristics our guide, 
learn to act in the spirit of the 14th National Party Congress 
and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central 
Committee, review and sum up our work since the province's 
Eighth Party Congress, determine the goals of struggle and the 
primary tasks henceforth in our socialist modernization,

CPC Committee and the Provincial Discipline Inspection 
Committee, and to mobilize and unify the province's CPC members 
and the masses to accelerate the reform and opening up and the 
modernization process and struggle for Zhejiang's achievement of 
the second step of our strategic goals ahead of schedule. 
  I hereby represent the Eighth Zhejiang Provincial CPC 
Committee in making the report before this congress. 
<H5>  I. Review and Summation of the Last Five Years' Work </H5>
  Since the Eighth Provincial Party Committee, under the Party 
Central Committee' leadership, the province's party 
organizations at all levels and the people and masses have 
diligently implemented the party's basic line, insisted on 
making economic construction the core, upheld the four basic 
principles, and have upheld reform and opening up. In 
particular, encouraged by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important 
speech during his southern tour and by the spirit of the 14th 
National Party Congress, we have seized the opportunity to 
accelerate development and have propelled Zhejiang's reform and 
construction onto a new phase. In the last five years, we have 
withstood the tests of political storm at home and the turmoils 
in the international scene; we have overcome the hardships 
brought by natural disasters, and we have implemented three 
years of rectifications and improvement. The province is 
politically stable, socially stable, and economically 
well-developed. The last five years have been five years during 
which the masses of cadres and people liberated their thinking, 
sought truth from facts, pursued reform and opening up, and made 
deliberate efforts to forge ahead. It has been five years of 
noticeable increase in economic strength, drastic changes in the 
appearance of town and country, continuous improvement in the 
living standards, and of comprehensive social and economic 
development. It has been five years of gradual strengthening of 
party construction, socialist spiritual civilization, and 
democratic legislation under the new conditions. It has been 
five years of seizing opportunities, of struggling in unity, and 
of continuous progress on the road to building a socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  One, economic development entered a new phase as we 
gained comprehensive economic strength. It is estimated 
that Zhejiang's 1993 GDP will top 164.5 billion yuan (148.3 
billion yuan based on 1990 prices), more than 76 percent higher 
than 1988's, and achieving the goal of quadrupling the GDP seven 
years ahead of schedule. The province's financial revenues is 
expected to be 15 billion yuan, more than 75 percent higher than 
1988's. The gross value of industrial output [GVIO] is estimated 
to be 378 billion yuan, nearly three time 1988's. Technological 
progress clearly played a larger part in the economic growth, 
accounting for approximately 35 percent. Enterprises made good 
progress in updating technological installations, improving 
production techniques, improving management and administration, 
and becoming better organized; we have achieved good overall 
economic efficiency. In the agricultural sector, while 
maintaining basic stability in grain production, the planting, 
forestry, livestock, and fishery industries also underwent 
all-out development. Agriculture using "one superior and two 
high" has taken its first steps. Township enterprises have 
become an important mainstay in Zhejiang's economic development, 
dominating two-thirds of the economy, and they played a very 
important role in subsidizing and developing agriculture, 
exporting to earn foreign exchange, promoting the shift in rural 
labor force, and in building up small cities and towns. The 
counties also gained economic strength. We now have many 
socially and economically well-developed counties and towns. 
Fixed asset investments in the last five years grew another 1.4 
fold over the previous five-year period; key construction 
projects achieved outstanding results. A succession of power 
plants, highways, railways, ports, airports, and communications 
facilities and other mainstay projects have been completed. The 
province's power generating capacity has increased by 2.36 
million kw; super highways have increased by more than 4,000 km; 
coastal port handling capacity has increased by 31.90 million 
tons. Program-controlled telephones were installed in the 
counties and cities, and city and rural telephone exchange 
capacity was increased by 1.14 million units. The province also 
worked on the Lake Tai and Wuqijiang River diversion and other 
major water conservancy projects. The infrastructure has greatly 
improved, which has increased the momentum of economic 
development. 
  Two, reform broadened and deepened; the market has 
become an important means of allocating resources. With 
regard to rural reform, we continued to stabilize and perfect 
the responsibility system, which is made up primarily of 
family-based, output-related contracts, and the two-tier 
management system which integrates centralization and 
decentralization. We were among the first to decontrol grain 
prices and actively promote the shareholding cooperative system. 
The factors of production have never been more active. The rural 
economy has begun to change tracks to the market economy. We 
made implementing the "Provision" and the pilot shareholding 
system our focal point to accelerate the change in management 
mechanisms in the state-owned enterprises and town and country 
collective enterprises. We began with the restructuring of the 
property rights system and worked hard to explore ways to 
achieve the public-ownership system effective. Publicly-owned 
enterprises, especially the large and medium-sized mainstay 
enterprises, gained new vitality, ability to adapt to market 
changes, and ability to compete. We actively encouraged and 
supported the localities to suit measures to local conditions in 
developing individual and privately-owned economies and adjust 
to the rapid and healthy development of non-public-owned 
economies of different local characteristics. Reform practices 
that emphasized the market adopted by Wenzhou and other 
localitie s have had good results and have produced a positive 
impact on the province's reform and economic development. The 
vast majority of commodities and labor services have been 
decontrolled; circulation has been enlivened. Markets for all 
types of commodities have grown rapidly; there are more than 
4,000 fairly large commodity markets. The Yiwu Small Goods 
Market and Shaoxing Light Industrial and Textile Market and 
other specialized wholesale markets with vast national impact 
have sprung up. Fund, technology, talent, labor, and real estate 
markets have begun to emerge, and we have a fledgling market 
system made up of multi-level markets with different management 
styles and made up of diverse economic components. We made 
promoting the integration of science and technology and the 
economy and the nurturing of useful talents our goal as we 
continued to promote the restructuring of the science and 
technology and education systems. A complete set of reforms 
pertaining to the social security, labor employment, and housing 
systems made good progress. Efforts to change the government's 
functions and improve macro regulation and control had a good 
start. 
  Three, opening up to the outside world made 
breakthroughs; the externally oriented economy underwent rapid 
development. We took the opportunity of the readjustment of 
the international industrial structure and the development and 
opening up of Pudong and paid special attention to giving play 
to our human relations and location advantages, and despite the 
relatively flat domestic market, we made use of international 
and domestic markets to supplement each other to develop our 
externally oriented economy. It is estimated that over the last 
five years, the province has signed foreign capital utilization 
contracts worth a total of $8.2 billion, 11.2 times more than 
the sum total of the previous 10 years since reform and opening 
up began. Actual foreign capital utilization came to $2.2 
billion, an increase of 3.4 folds. In 1993, the province's 
foreign export volume came to $4.35 billion, 1.7 times more than 
1988's. At the same time, we actively expanded the scope and 
territory of our opening up. The number of open cities and 
counties has increased to 37, and the number of state-class 
development zones has increased to six. The State Council has 
also approved the comprehensive opening up of the Ningbo 
tax-free zone and Daxie Island to the outside world. The number 
of province-level development zones has increased to 37, and 
many industrial satellite towns have sprung up. These have 
formed a preliminary pattern of opening up where development 
zones, open cities, open regions, and industrial satellite 
towns, foreign trade, foreign capital, and foreign economy are 
all emphasized. 
  Four, people's lives have clearly improved, and we are 
steadily becoming fairly well-off. The urban and rual 
population are earning higher income. It is estimated that in 
1993 the average per-capita regular income for people in cities 
and towns was 3,400 yuan; rural per-capita income topped 1,590 
yuan, and after factoring in the higher prices, they represented 
increases of 42.4 percent and 25.6 percent, respectively, 
compared to 1988. Living conditions further improved. In 1993, 
the per-capita living space for people in cities and towns was 
11.8 sq m, 2.5 sq meter more than in 1988. Sixty-eight percent 
of the people had full housing. The rural population's 
per-capita living space was 32 sq meters, 6 sq meters more than 
in 1988. The consumption mix of people living in both urban and 
rural areas clearly improved, further improving the quality of 
life. 
  Five, spiritual civilization and democratic legislative 
constructions made new progress, which brought comprehensive 
social progress. Scientific and technological undertakings 
underwent rapid development. Over the whole period, significant 
results were obtained in 1,570 scientific and technological 
projects. The scientific research units gained vitality, and the 
number of civilian-run scientific and technological institutions 
has greatly. The development of educational undertakings 
accelerated. Province-wide, 83 percent of the populated areas 
have implemented nine-year compulsory education. We had great 
success at eliminating illiteracy. The structure of secondary 
school education clearly improved. Vocational-technical 
education and adult education developed fairly rapidly; 
full-time enrollment in colleges and universities increased 
significantly, and the quality of education improved somewhat. 
Cultural undertakings flourished; literature and arts, radio and 
TV broadcast, news and publication, theory studies and so on 
produced some very fine results. We built a new radio and TV 
broadcast center, the Zhejiang Museum, the Hemudu Museum, and 
other major cultural facilities. Medical and public health 
conditions improved. Mass sports activities were held, and 
competitive sports reached higher standards. Our family planning 
program remained the most progress in the nation. Activities 
relating to spiritual civilization construction were broadly 
launched in the urban and rural areas. We advocated good social 
tendencies, and the masses were continuously introduced to new 
ideas and concepts. We have gradually freed ourselves from the 
bondage of "leftist" ideology and outdated concepts and have 
become more aware of the ideas of reform and opening up. 
Society's spiritual outlook has changed dramatically. 
  With respect to the construction of the democratic 
legislation system, we supported the People's Congress and its 
standing committee's carrying out their duties according to the 
law to strengthen the legislative process. Over the last five 
years, Zhejiang Province has promulgated and approved 58 local 
laws and provisions and issued 62 administrative regulations; we 
have stepped up law enforcement and supervision. We attached 
importance to united front work. The people's consultative 
conferences at all levels participated in government, discussed 
politics, exercised democratic supervision, and made many 
important proposals and suggestions on major issues pertaining 
to the construction of Zhejiang's two civilizations. We have 
strengthened the comprehensive administration of public security 
and engaged in in-depth struggles to "wipe out pornography," 
"eliminate the six evils," and enforce the "three crackdowns and 
one prohibition." We cracked down hard on serious penal and 
economic crimes, launched universal legal education, and 
enhanced the masses' legal concept, and we have maintained 
social stability. 
  Six, we adjusted to the new situation of reform and 
opening up, and party construction was strengthened and 
improved. We attached importance to the party's ideological 
and theoretical construction and broadly educated the masses of 
party members and cadres on the basic theories of Marxism, the 
party's basic line, and basic knowledge about the party. In 
particular, we arm the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
socialist theories with Chinese characteristics. On the 
important issue of reform and opening up, we clarified what was 
right and wrong, got rid of outdated ideas and concepts, and 
made the masses of party members and cadres more conscious and 
steadfast about going all-out to implement the party's basic 
line. We strengthened the formation of the contingent of cadres 
and trained and promoted many fine young and middle-aged cadres. 
We readjusted and amplified the leading groups at above 
county-level, improved the groups' structure, and diligently 
worked on establishing the leading groups' ideologies and 
working style and on cadre training. Through the process of 
"double promote, double test" and other formats, we openly chose 
party and government leading cadres. We implemented the cadre 
exchange and leave-of-absence and retirement systems and 
actively restructured the cadre system. We worked on the 
construction of grass-roots organizations in a focused and 
systematic way and rectified and changed the backward rural 
party branches and reinforced a whole array of village-level 
organizations that centered around the party branches. We 
improved the overall quality of the enterprise leading groups 
and gave play to the political core role of enterprise party 
organizations. We focused on the new situation and diligently 
summed up our experiences and formulated a program and made 
suggestions on grass-roots rural, enterprise, and office party 
organizations. We strengthened the education, training, and 
management of the masses of party members and recruited party 
members from the production, management, scientific research and 
education frontlines and gave play to the exemplary vanguard 
role of the CPC members in the construction of the two 
civilizations. We diligently worked on our party's working style 
and on building an honest government. The leading cadres took 
the lead in embracing honesty and self-discipline, and we 
prosecuted some cases of internal violation of party discipline 
and expelled some corrupt elements. We stopped the leading 
cadres and staff in party and government organs from such 
unhealthy practices as accepting gift certificates and money or 
using public funds to travel abroad or take trips. We are still 
in the process of sorting out the improper fee collections and 
rectifying the practices of party and government organs doing 
business and running enterprises and so on. In recent days, 
anti-corruption struggles have had tentative success in some 
areas. 
  Zhejiang owes its success over the last five years to the 
proper leadership of the Party Central Committee, the foundation 
laid down by the previous session of the provincial party 
committee, the provincial party organizations at all levels, the 
masses of CPC members, the democratic parties and factions, the 
general public, the troops stationed in Zhejiang, and people of 
all nationalities in the province who struggled in unity. We 
also owe our success to the vigorous support of the fraternal 
provinces and municipalities, our Hong Kong-Macao-Taiwan 
compatriots, and the overseas Chinese as well as to the sincere 
cooperation of our friends from around the world. I hereby 
represent the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee in expressing 
our heart-felt gratitude and paying our highest respect to 
comrades who have contributed to Zhejiang's reform and 
development and to our friends who have shown concern and 
support for Zhejiang's construction. 
  In reviewing and summing up our work over the last five 
years, the most fundamental point is that we must always 
resolutely uphold the basic theory of developing a socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, 
liberate our thinking, seek truth from facts, and perform our 
work with creativity. In the last five years, reform and 
development have had many favorable opportunities but have also 
faced some complicated situations. The provincial party 
committee insisted on making economic construction the core and 
made deepening the reform, expanding the scope of opening up, 
and accelerating the pace of development the basic guiding 
ideology for its work, and in the actual course of work, it went 
through a process of summing up its experiences and continuously 
deepening and heightening its understanding. After the 1989 
political storm and in the midst of the changing international 
situation, the provincial party committee followed the Central 
Party Committee's plans to reinforce the people's socialist 
conviction and educate them on the party's basic line, and we 
concentrated our energy on economic construction. During the 
period of rectification and improvement, while the provincial 
party committee carried out the Party Central Committee's macro 
policies and adopted measures to promote economic recovery and 
development, it also acquired a better understanding of the 
province's own situation and established an economic development 
guiding ideology that centered around improving the overall 
quality of the national economy to "lay foundation, set 
standards, and increase efficiency." After Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's important southern tour speech and the 14th National 
Party Congress, we upheld the criteria of the "three 
beneficial," further liberated our thinking, and smashed the 
"leftist" and old ideological bondages, learned and borrowed 
from the advance experiences of our fraternal provinces and 
municipalities, stepped up the reform and opening up, seized 
opportunities, accelerated development, and proposed the goals 
of striving to form a tentative basic framework of the socialist 
market economic system by the end of the Eighth Five-year Plan 
period and basically create the new economic system's 
functioning mechanisms and operating modes by the end of the 
century. We established a pattern of opening up to the outside 
world whereby we "let the three cities take the lead, accentuate 
what is important, rely on the ports, develop along two lines, 
proceed in steps, and open up in all directions." We made the 
important decisions to reform the grain procurement and 
marketing system, decontrol grain prices, readjust the 
agricultural structure, develop "one superior and two high" in 
agriculture, and guide agriculture and the peasants toward the 
market. We established the strategy of "using science and 
education to vitalize the province" and truly shift economic 
construction onto a new track where we rely on scientific and 
technological progress and improve labor quality. We focused on 
the new situation that have emerged from the rapid economic 
development and followed the Central Party Committee's 
instruction to promptly strengthen regulation and control and 
strived to maintain the economy's sustained, speedy, and healthy 
development. While it concentrated on economic construction, the 
Provincial Party Committee also complied with the general 
principle of "grasping with both hands" and attached increasing 
importance to party construction, spiritual civilization, and 
the democratic legislative system and formulated a preliminary 
line of thinking which, given the condition of developing a 
socialist market economy, consisted pri marily of the 
construction of leading groups, grass-roots organizations, and 
socialist spiritual civilization and an honest government. We 
have formulated a socialist spiritual civilization construction 
program for the entire province. The practices and creations of 
the province's party organizations at all levels and the masses 
were the sources of these important decisions and measures. 
They suited Zhejiang's realistic conditions and have 
effectively promoted Zhejiang's reform and opening up and 
economic and social development. 
  When looking back at the past and looking forward to the 
future, we should soberly realize that there are still many 
problems and conflicts before us, and there will still be many 
mistakes and inadequacies in our work. Zhejiang is a coastal 
province, and based on the Central Party Committee's standards, 
we still fall short in ideologies and understanding, and our 
workstyle still does not measure up. We still lack boldness of 
vision and courage in our reform and opening up; we lack 
pioneering spirit. When we run into problems, we fail to reach 
consensus and are slow to reach unity in thinking. Decisions 
have been made on some matters, but we fail to carry them out 
firmly and decisively. We lack a clear understanding of the new 
situation and new problems that have merged amid the rapid 
economic development and the transition from the old to the new 
systems. In our practical work, the idea that agriculture is the 
nation's foundation is still not firmly established, and our 
ways and means of guiding agriculture and the peasants toward 
the market still need to be improved and made more thorough. We 
still have many problems in speeding up the development of 
science and technology and education; we must still work long 
and hard on it. On the issue of "grasping with both hands," we 
are still tough on the one hand and lenient on the other hand. 
In many ways, our party construction, spiritual civilization, 
and democratic legislative system are still incompatible with 
the new situation. In particular, we still face many problems 
with the party's workstyle, honesty in government, social 
tendencies, and public security and so on. Negative and corrupt 
phenomena are still rampant in some areas, and the masses are 
upset. We must pay close attention to these issues and work hard 
to resolve them to guarantee the success of Zhejiang's reform 
and opening up and modernization. 
<H5>  II. Future Objectives of Struggle and Guiding Ideologies </H5>
  The 14th National Party Congress has drawn up a strategic 
plan for the Changjiang Delta and other coastal regions. 
Zhejiang is situated on the south wing of the Changjiang Delta; 
it has a fairly sound economic base, and we are ready and 
determined to seize the opportunity to accelerate development. 
By the year 2010, Zhejiang's economic and social development's 
major indicators should reach that of a moderately 
well-developed nation today, and we strive to become one of the 
first provinces in China to achieve modernization. 
  The 1990's is a critical period in Zhejiang's modernization. 
By the year 2000, the main objectives of reform and construction 
are: 
  Quadruple the GDP. We want to improve quality, 
optimize the structure, increase efficiency, and increase the 
GDP at an average rate of more than 10 percent a year. Based on 
1990 prices, the GDP should exceed 230 billion yuan, averaging 
more than 5,00 yuan per person, four times that of 1980's. We 
even hope to achieve that goal ahead of schedule. 
  Establish the basic socialist market economic 
operating mechanisms. We should tentatively set up a modern 
enterprise system, allocation system, social security system, 
and a macro management system that meet the needs of the market 
economy and basically complete the change in government 
functions and gradually establish a unified open market system 
so that the market can play a fundamental role in allocating 
resources. 
  Set up a fairly complete externally oriented economic 
system. The economy should become even more externally 
oriented. Foreign export volume should increase at a rate of 16 
percent a year, topping $10 billion and accounting for about 25 
percent of the GDP. Foreign capital utilization should become 
one of the main sources of Zhejiang's construction funds. We 
should expand the bilateral flow of domestic and foreign funds, 
capital, and labor and gradually develop multinational 
operations. We should set up operating modes that link up with 
international regulation s and practices and meet the needs of 
the externally oriented economy. 
  Modernize the economic and social structures. We 
should steadily increase agricultural output, clearly improve 
quality, and speed up the modernization process. The province's 
non-agricultural labor force should account for more than 55 
percent of the total labor force; the service industries should 
account for around 35 percent of the GDP. Industries and 
services should gradually gather in the cities and towns; the 
rate of urbanization should reach more than 35 percent. The 
natural rate of population increase should be kept at below 8 
per thousand. 
  Scientific, technological, and educational undertakings 
should be gradually developed to keep up with the economic and 
social development. By the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan 
period, Zhejiang's nine-year compulsory education basically 
should become universal and illiteracy among the young people 
and mature basically should be wiped out, and on those bases, 
cities and towns at above county-level basically should be able 
to provide senior high school education as needed and provide a 
larger proportion of junior and senior high school graduates 
with vocational-technical training if they do not want to 
further their formal education. We should increase full-time 
enrollment by 10,000 people in the regular colleges and in adult 
colleges. We should improve the quality of the workers and 
promote scientific and technological progress. For every 10,000 
people, we need 115 scientists and technicians. Technological 
progress should account for 40-50 percent of economic growth. 
  Raise the level of spiritual civilization in the urban 
and rural areas. To meet the needs of developing the 
socialist market economy and promoting comprehensive social 
progress, we must strive to improve the people's ideological and 
moral quality and scientific and cultural quality and nurture 
idealistic, moralistic, cultured, and disciplined socialist 
citizens. We want a relatively sound democratic legislative 
system, a stable and unified society, good moral habits, 
flourishing cultural undertakings, and a nice and clean 
environment. 
  Help the people to become relatively well-off fairly 
soon. While most localities in the province are striving to 
become relatively well-off by the end of the Eighth Five-Year 
Plan period, we should further raised their material living 
standard and amplify their spiritual lives. The poor regions 
should become relatively well-off by the end of the Ninth 
Five-Year Plan period. The per-capita regular cost-of-living 
income of people in the cities and towns and the per capita 
income of people in the rural areas should double that of 1990's 
based on constant prices. 
  In the 1990's, as we move toward modernization, we will face 
profound changes in the international and domestic situations. 
In particular, because of our objective to set up a socialist 
market economic system and go all out to implement reform, we 
will face rare historical opp ortunities as well as grim 
challenges. We must seize the opportunities and face the 
challenges head-on. We have many favorable conditions but also 
many impediments. After more than a decade of reform and 
construction, Zhejiang has acquired strong material and 
technological bases; our agricultural development has reached 
fairly high standards; our industries, especially township 
industries, are fairly large in scale, and our production 
conditions have improved. We will have much potential for 
accelerating our development in the future. Zhejiang's 
commodities markets developed fairly early; our enterprise 
management mechanisms are flexible, and we have developed 
several types of economies at the same time. We have strong 
internal vitality for economic development, which makes it 
easier for us to change over to the new economic system. 
Zhejiang's superior location, ports, and human resources are 
playing an increasingly important role in opening up to the 
outside world, which will facilitate our making even better use 
of the international and domestic resources and markets to 
accelerate development. In particular, what is rare and precious 
is that the masses of party members, cadres, and people have 
displayed tremendous enthusiasm and pioneering and creative 
spirit during reform and opening up, and they have become a 
mighty force behind the socialist modernization construction. At 
the same time, we should also see that Zhejiang's economic 
operating mechanisms are not smooth; its infrastructure has 
serious "bottlenecks"; its factors of production are not put to 
full use. As the main force behind the province's economic 
growth, overall, the processing industry's products are still 
low in technical content; enterprises' technological 
installation standards and organization are poor. Our products 
lack competitiveness; we are still using extensive management 
and quantitative expansion to bring growth. We lack people with 
scientific and technical skills or international trade and 
business and economic management training and experience. Our 
ideologies and concepts, ways of thinking, work methods, and 
management system are incompatible with the development of the 
market economy. These problems will increasing impede the 
formation of the unified open market at home and hinder our 
efforts to link tracks with the international markets. We must 
thoroughly analyze the situation and correctly understand the 
situation before us, rouse our spirits, fill ourselves with 
confidence, and increase our own sense of urgency of the times 
and sense of historic responsibility. 
  In order to achieve Zhejiang's grand reform and development 
objectives, we must follow the theory of constructing a 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, staunchly uphold the 
party's basic lines for a hundred years, start out from 
Zhejiang's own reality, review our work experience over the last 
five years, and put the "five insists" in our work guiding 
ideologies: 
  One, insist on making economic construction the core 
and always make developing the productive forces our basic 
duty. Insisting on development is sound reasoning. 
Ultimately, what is going to solve our problems is economic 
development. We must seize the opportunity, accelerate 
development, and reach a higher plane once every few years. We 
must improve the national economy's overall quality, "lay 
foundation, set standards, and improve efficiency"; we must 
reinforce the three foundations--agriculture, infrastructure, 
and science and technologies and education--vigorously raise the 
technological and management standards, and focus on the 
development of industries and products that have high technical 
content, earn foreign exchange, have high added-value, have 
large market capacity, are low in energy and raw material 
consumptions, and have no adverse environmental impact. We must 
combine speed and efficiency and embark on the road of thorough 
reform, optimal structure, intensive management, and 
externally-oriented development. We must accentuate the 
essential, unify planning with due consideration for all 
concerned, do our utmost, gauge our own capacity, guide action 
according to circumstances, develop our strong points and avoid 
our shortcomings, struggle arduously, unite and move forward to 
achieve sustained, speedy, and healthy economic development, and 
bring more real benefits to the people. 
  Two, insist on using reform to achieve development and 
always make reform the main driving force behind economic and 
social development. The key to accelerated development is 
thorough reform. Only by seizing reform opportunities can we 
seize development opportunities. As economic growth accelerates 
and economic relations become more complicated, we must boldly 
explore and blaze new trails and firmly and resolutely pursue 
in-depth reform. We should meet the needs of developing a 
socialist market economic system and make reform more forceful, 
uphold the guiding principle of making the public-ownership 
system be the primary system while allowing other economic 
components to develop at the same time. We should wrap around 
the five key links--a modern enterprise system, a unified market 
system, a perfect macro regulation and control system that 
emphasizes indirect measures, an income allocation system that 
primarily allocates income according to labor and gives priority 
to efficiency but also takes fairness into consideration, and a 
multi-level social security system. We should actively and 
steadily deal with the relationship among reform and development 
and social stability, achieve major breakthroughs, coordinate 
the entire process, proceed in gradual steps, and go all out 
with reform while maintaining social stability. 
  Three, insist on opening up in all directions and 
always make pushing outward the primary means of accelerating 
development. We should actively take part in international 
division of labor and exchange and make full use of the 
international and domestic markets and resources to promote 
economic development. We should further broaden the scope and 
widen the domain of opening up to the outside world, export 
higher grade goods, raise the standard of foreign capital 
utilization, and escalate our international economic and 
technological cooperation and exchange. We should link tracks 
with the international markets with respect to enterprise 
mechanisms, market standards, and management systems to increase 
our ability to compete internationally. 
  Four, insist on "grasping with both hands" and "firm 
with both hands," and always make giving play to our political 
superiority the fundamental guarantee of our economic and social 
development. To realize the grand objective of socialist 
modernization, we must insist on the party's leadership, 
strengthen party ideology, organization, and workstyle. We must 
adhere to the purpose of serving the people with our hearts and 
minds, carry forward and amplify the party's fine traditions and 
workstyle, and strive to raise our leadership standard in 
modernization. Our spiritual civilization construction must obey 
and serve the central purpose of economic construction and 
provide the strong spiritual drive, intellectual support, 
ideological guarantee, and good public opinion environment for 
developing the socialist market economic system and 
modernization construction. We must abide by the guiding 
principle of emphasizing construction, make doing our best a 
basic principle, insist on mediation and guidance, enhance 
unity, and focus on mobilizing enthusiasm. We must emphasize 
education and the legal system, improve personal quality, 
discipline social conduct, improve social tendencies, and 
preserve social and political stability. We must actively 
explore new ways to strengthen party construction, socialist 
spiritual civilization, and democratic legislation under the 
conditions of the market economy. 
  Five, insist on liberating ideas and seeking truth from 
facts, and always make the "three beneficial" the criterion for 
disguishing right from wrong. With respect to "one core and 
two basic points," we must guard against the right, but mainly 
we must stop the "left." We must continue to smash the "leftist" 
ideological bondages, insist that the basic principle of reform 
and opening up cannot be changed, and that there will be on 
endless debates. We must boldly explore and dare to experiment. 
We must consciously ask ourselves, "Do the people support this 
or not?" "Do the people agree with this or not?" "Are the people 
happy about this or not?" "Are the people satisfied or not?" 
These questions are the starting point and the final destination 
in everything we think, do, and decide. We must insist on 
material dialectics and avoid partial views. We must have a 
scientific attitude, respect objective laws, start out from 
reality, and be creative in our work. We must respect the 
masses' pioneering spirit and guide, protect, and give play to 
the masses' enthusiasm. 
<H5>  III. The Primary Tasks of Reform and Development for the </H5>
Next Five Years 
  The next five years will be five years that determine 
whether 
Zhejiang will achieve its 1990's objectives. It will be the 
critical five years for developing the basic socialist market 
economic operating mechanisms and will also be five years for 
laying the foundation for achieving modernization in the 
beginning of the next century. In these five years, we must work 
hard to accomplish the following eight major tasks: 
  One, move forward with reform and accelerate the 
track-changing to the socialist market economic system. 
  "The CPC Central Party Committee's Decision on Several 
Issues 
Pertaining to the Establishment of the Socialist Market Economic 
System" is the program for action to accelerate reform and 
development. We should heed the Central Party Committee's 
demands, start out from Zhejiang's own conditions, formulate and 
carry out specific programs and measures of implementation, 
accentuate the reform focuses, pay attention to linking them 
with the current reform measures, and lose not time in pushing 
forward with reform. 
  We must make enterprise reform more thorough and concentrate 
efforts on creating a new enterprise system. We should make 
smoothing out property rights relations and changing management 
mechanisms the core in accelerating the development of a modern 
enterprise system that clearly delineates property rights, 
specifies rights and responsibilities, separates government and 
enterprises, and utilizes scientific management. We should 
actively explore proper modes and effective ways of managing and 
administering publicly-owned assets, especially state-owned 
assets. Setting up a modern enterprise system is an arduous and 
complicated task. We must create the conditions and proceed in 
gradual steps. Today, we must continue to implement the 
"Industrial Enterprise Law Under the Ownership by the Whole 
People System" and "Regulations on Changing Operating Mechanisms 
in Industrial Enterprises in the Ownership by the Whole People 
System," hand over a hundred percent of enterprises' rights and 
responsibilities, and accelerate the pace of changing the 
state-owned enterprises' management mechanisms and adjusting 
their organizational structure to further enliven the large and 
medium-sized mainstay enterprises. We must strengthen the 
supervision and management of state-owned enterprises' 
properties, guide the flow of the existing stock and the 
direction of input of the incremental assets and guarantee the 
preservation and appreciation of property value and quality 
improvement. Qualified state-owned enterprises should gradually 
implement the company system. Most small state-owned enterprises 
can turn to contract management or lease management or 
reorganize under the shareholding cooperative system, or they 
can be sold to collectives or individuals. Starting out from the 
fact that Zhejiang has a fairly large proportion of collective 
enterprises, we should pay attention to sorting out the property 
rights relations between township enterprises and the cities' 
and towns' collective enterprises. The emphasis should be on 
vigorously promoting the shareholding cooperative system. 
Through property circulation and reorganization, we should 
develop economic units of mixed ownership systems and create a 
new ownership structure. We can develop some large 
trans-regional, trans-industrial enterprise groups which are 
primarily publicly owned but are linked by the ties in property 
rights. We should make use of such formats as limited liability 
companies, shareholding corporations, wholly state-owned 
enterprises, cooperative management enterprises, and 
shareholding cooperative companies to gradually standardize 
enterprise organization. 
  We must uphold the guiding principle that the 
public-ownership system is the primary system but economies of 
different components may coexist and develop at the same time. 
The role of the public-ownership system in the national economy 
may vary depending on locality and industry. While developing ad 
strengthening the publicly-owned economy, we should continue to 
vigorously develop foreign-funded economy and actively encourage 
the development of individual and private economies. We should 
let families and individuals take over industries and products 
suitable for family-based production and operation. In 
economically underdeveloped regions, we must support the 
development of individual and private economies even more, so 
that they can be important growth points in the local economies. 
We must perfect the pertinent policies and rules and regulations 
and strengthen the guidance and management of individual, 
private, and foreign-funded economies to ensure their healthy 
development. 
  By putting the emphasis on developing producer goods 
markets, 
we can speed up the fostering and development of the market 
system and promote modernized circulation. we should further 
develop the commodity markets, and taking the needs of commodity 
circulation into consideration, we should build a fully-equipped 
commodity market network that integrates large, medium-sized, 
and small markets and accommodates all economic formats and 
operati ng modes. We should actively foster financial, 
technology, information, labor, skilled personnel, and real 
estate markets; we should develop and amplify securities 
exchange institutions, gradually groom capital markets, and 
create the conditions to set up futures markets that are linked 
to the international markets. We should further smooth out price 
relations and set up mechanisms that mainly let the market set 
prices. We should standardize market behavior and smash regional 
and departmental separatism and blockades, oppose unfair 
competition, develop market intermediaries, create an 
environment of fair competition, and form a large unified, open, 
competitive, and orderly market. 
  We must uphold the system which primarily allocates income 
according to work while accommodating other forms of allocation 
and gives expression to the principle of efficiency first but 
also takes fairness into consideration. We should actively 
promote reform of the allocation system, bring in the 
competitive mechanisms, and smash egalitarianism and allow 
reasonable wage differences. We should continue to encourage 
some regions and some peoples to get rich first through honest 
hard work and legal operations. We encourage those who got rich 
first to help the not-yet-rich, so that eventually everybody is 
well-off. Through our allocation policy and tax regulation, we 
can avoid letting a handful of people earn exorbitant income, 
which will cause extreme polarization. We must give play to all 
positive factors and amplify the retirement, unemployment, and 
the medical insurance systems and gradually set up mechanisms 
that create a benign cycle to gather, utilize, and add value to 
the social security fund and develop a multi-level urban and 
rural social security system. 
  We should follow the principle of separation of government 
and enterprises and streamlining, unification, and efficiency 
when promoting the restructuring of party and government organs 
and changing the government's functions. We should reduce the 
number of specialized economic management organs and the 
overly-small departments; reduce staff size; and improve their 
overall coordination, law enforcement and supervision, and 
social management functions. We should follow the Central Party 
Committee's unified plan to carefully formulate a program to 
implement the restructuring of the party and government organs 
and carry it out actively and steadily in steps. Next year, we 
should basically complete the restructuring of organs at the 
province-level and in 11 cities and prefectures and basically 
reform the county-level organs in the following year. We should 
accelerate the restructuring of the personnel system and 
gradually set up a scientific, categorized management system and 
effective incentive mechanisms in the organs and enterprises and 
institutions in accordance with their different characteristics. 
Reforms in these areas must be coordinated with the reforms in 
the organs and the wage system, and we should install the public 
employee system as soon as possible. 
  We must have a firm grasp on the restructuring of the 
taxation, financial, investment, and planning systems and others 
key area. We must seize the reform opportunity and actively find 
ways and means to carry out reforms. We should set up mechanisms 
that coordinate but also act as constraints in economic planning 
and monetary and financial matters. We should increase auditing 
and economic supervision and change the ways and means we 
provide leadership in economic matters. By drawing up central 
plans and putting a handle on the policies, through guidance and 
information and organization and coordination, and by providing 
services and inspection and supervision, the government's direct 
economic management can be changed to indirect management. While 
obeying the Central Party Committee's macro regulation and 
control, we should improve and strengthen our economic 
regulation and control. 
  Two, open up to the outside world in all directions and 
make the economy even more externally oriented. 
  On the basis of Zhejiang's pattern of opening up, we should 
take advantage of the timing of the development and opening up 
of Shanghai's Pudong, seize the initiative, participate 
actively, and while we focus on Ningbo, Wenzhou, the coastal 
open cities, the Hangzhou international tourist city, and the 
open regions, we should further expand the scope and territory 
of our opening up, speed up the development and opening up of 
central and western Zhejiang, the islands, and the ocean. We 
should give play to local superiorities and expand our opening 
up in all directions, at different levels, and through all 
channels; so that Zhejiang can truly become an important wing as 
the Changjiang Delta's economy take flight. 
  We should further widen the scope of foreign capital 
utilization to emphasize both quantity and quality. We should 
move ahead with our primary, secondary, and tertiary industries 
and stress large, medium-sized, and small projects; we should 
also concentrate our efforts on expanding size and raising 
standards. We must keep a reserve of projects and follow the 
state's industrial policy in guiding foreign capital input, 
particularly toward the infrastructure, raw material industries, 
and the "grafting" and transformation of old enterprises; we 
should encourage the opening of technology-intensive and 
export-oriented enterprises. We must actively utilize foreign 
capital to develop developmental agriculture and agriculture 
that earns foreign exchange. We must continue to improve the 
investment environment, utilize foreign capital in different 
ways, and in particular, pay attention to attracting even more 
investments from large enterprises and financial groups. We 
should recruit more foreign businesses and increase the ratio of 
actual foreign investment. We must strengthen management and 
give more play to the leading--dragon head--roles of the 
tax-free zones, economic and technological development zones, 
and the high and new-tech industry development zone and to the 
role as "windows" to the outside world of the "three kinds of 
wholly or partially foreign-owned" enterprises. 
  We must uphold the reform direction of unified policy, 
decontrolled management, fair competition, integration of 
industry and commerce, and promotion of the agency system and 
fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the foreign trade companies at 
all levels, the non-state-operated export enterprises, and the 
"three kinds of wholly or partially foreign-owned" enterprises. 
We must use quality to gain business and further expand our 
foreign exports. We must optimize the mix of export commodities, 
raise the proportion of export of high added-value commodities 
and commodities that earn more foreign exchange, and open up 
markets in different ways. We should accelerate the foreign 
trade enterprises' change in management mechanisms and encourage 
them to become more industrialized, group-oriented, and 
internationalized to gradually become trans-national operations. 
We should actively develop transportation, warehousing, and 
information and consultation and other service trades associated 
with the import and export trades and continue to expand our 
foreign economic cooperation and exchange, develop foreign 
contracted engineering projects, increase labor exports, and 
create the conditions for setting up enterprises outside of this 
province. We should actively develop trade and economic and 
technological exchange with Taiwan. 
  We should adjust to the development of the externally 
oriented economy and accelerate the construction of the 
enterprise management system, the economic operating modes, the 
social services system, and foreign-related policies and laws 
and regulations and so on. We must abide by international 
regulations and conventions and link tracks with international 
markets. We must step up training of personnel who handle 
foreign matter and promptly develop a mainstay contingent that 
is familiar with international trade, financial businesses, and 
international laws and regulations. 
  Three, actively utilize market mechanisms to allocate 
resources and give impetus to a proper and modern industrial 
structure. 
  Reinforcing agriculture's fundamental role is the 
primary task when adjusting the industrial structure. We 
should make developing agricultural output, vitalizing the 
agricultural products market, and increasing the peasants' 
income our goal. We must plant our foothold on deepening the 
reform, speed up the development of rural economic operating 
mechanisms and management system that meet the needs of the 
socialist market economy, and promote the modernization of 
agriculture to bring economic prosperity to the rural areas. 
One, we must work hard to strengthen leadership in agricultural 
and rural works. Party committees and governments at all levels 
must firmly establish the concept that agricultural is the 
nation's foundation and must never slacken its leadership in the 
agricultural and rural tasks. The party and government must 
personally take hold of agriculture, make sure that the party's 
rural policies are being implemented, organize the departments 
to serve agriculture and the peasants, and strengthen the 
comprehensive agricultural and rural work departments. We must 
nurture and stabilize a contingent of cadres who know 
agriculture, the peasants, and rural tasks well. Two, we must 
deepen rural reform. The responsibility system, which is 
dominated by the family-based output-related contract system, 
and the two-tier management system which integrates 
centralization and decentralization must become the basic 
economic systems for the rural areas; they must be stabilized 
and constantly improved. While upholding the system of 
collective land ownership, we should extend the farmland 
contract periods and permit the inheritance of contract 
management rights in development-oriented production projects 
and allow the legal transfer of land-use rights with 
compensation. While vigorously promoting the shareholding 
cooperative system in township enterprises, we should also bring 
the system to the planting, forestry, livestock, aquatic 
products and developmental agricultural industries and other 
sectors. Three, we should strengthen macro guidance according to 
market conditions and develop "one superior and two high" 
agriculture to stabilize grain production and improve grain 
quality and optimize the mix of crops. We should vigorously 
develop non-grain foodstuff and develop developmental 
agriculture and agriculture that earns foreign exchange. We 
should increase effective supply and raise agriculture's 
economic efficiency and follow the law to protect farmland and 
stabilize the multiple crop indices. We must strictly prohibit 
the abandonment of farmland, and we must increase the land 
productivity rate. Four, we should comply with the profit 
principle and the internal production relations to promote the 
agricultural product purchase and marketing contract system and 
develop production bases and lead enterprises. We should set up 
a service network made up of rural collective econo mic 
organizations, state economic and technological departments, and 
peasant associations. We should develop different forms of 
management that integrate commerce, industry, and agriculture 
and set up and perfect different types of rural markets and 
encourage the peasants to get into the circulation sector. We 
should create a good social environment to link the thousands 
and hundreds of thousands of small producers with the 
ever-changing large markets and raise the level of socialized 
agricultural services and the level of organization as we orient 
the peasants toward the market. Five, we should actively and 
steadily promote proper scale economy in agriculture and 
increase the intensity in farming. We should develop more rural 
production and management entities that meet the needs of the 
socialist market economic development and smash community 
barriers, so that all types of factors of production can 
circulate properly within a wider area and optimize their 
recombination. We should increase labor productivity and attain 
economies of scale to gain new production superiority. Six, in 
the market economy, we should continue to attach importance to 
the government's vigorous protection and society's concern and 
support for agriculture. We should gradually sort out grain and 
other major agricultural product prices, amplify the reserve 
regulation system and market hazard fund, implement the 
protection price procurement system, and perfect the circulation 
system to protect the peasants' interests. According to the 
Central Party Committee, the financial ministry's annual 
agricultural input should increase faster than the increase in 
its regular revenues and agricultural loans should increase 
faster than the average rate of increase in other loans, and 
therefore we should continue to increase agricultural and 
agriculture-related input. We should actively encourage the 
peasants and collectives to increase labor and fund input, 
increase basic farm construction, build and repair water 
conservancy projects, engage in afforestation and the greening 
of the environment, conserve soil and water, continuously 
improve agricultural production conditions, and strengthen the 
agricultural material and technological bases. 
  Strengthening infrastructure construction and 
optimizing the industry mix are the keys to the readjustment of 
the industrial structure. The emphasis of infrastructure 
construction should be on transportation, communications, power, 
and water conservancy projects. Under the state's unified 
planning, we should give full play to the superiority of the 
Beilun deep-water port and accelerate coastal port 
constructions, with the emphasis on Ningbo and Zhoushan and also 
include Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Zhapu, to gradually transform the 
inland river channels and form a colony of ports that accentuate 
the important, share in proper division of labor, supplement 
each other's advantages, and are fully equipped. We should focus 
on airport construction, with special emphasis on the Hangzhou 
International Airport, and form a colony of large, medium-sized, 
and small airports. We should speed up the construction of the 
Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Ningbo-Taizhou-Wenzhou, 
Hangzhou-Jinhua-Quzhou, and the Hangzhou-Nanjing (the segment 
within Zhejiang) freeways; the Jinhua-Wenzhou and the 
Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways and the Xiaoshan-Ningbo multiple rail 
tracks; we should also actively study the feasibility of 
constructing local railways in Jinhua, Ningbo, and Taizhou, and 
do a good job with planning and constructi on, so as to 
gradually form a complete road-to-port land transportation 
network. We should expand the land-water-air trunklines' 
transport capacity and gradually set up a broad communications 
avenue that spans the whole province and links with other 
provinces. We must do a good job with the construction of 
communications facilities and create a quality, efficient 
digital communications network throughout the province. We 
should strengthen power planning and development and accelerate 
the construction of coastal power plants, Tianhuangping water 
pumping and storage plants, and electric wire netting in Beilun, 
Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Qinshan, and gradually ease and 
improve the province's power supply situation. We should draw up 
a plan for harnessing the major rivers and lakes and key 
flood-prone areas, tackle the major water conservancy and city 
water supply projects, increase our flood-prevention and 
draught-resistant capabilities, and improve industrial and 
residential water supply situation. We should pay more attention 
to municipal projects and public utility projects, strengthen 
geological exploration and develop and utilize our mineral 
resources properly. 
  The focal point of the readjustment of the industrial 
structure is the processing industry. We should target both 
domestic and foreign markets, make efficiency our core, utilize 
high and new technologies to transform traditional industries, 
and accelerate the pace of readjusting the product-mix. We 
should make vigorously increasing the products' technological 
content the main direction of assault and upgrade our 
technological equipment, production techniques, and enterprise 
organization to create some superior specialty products that are 
high in quality and grade, that have high added-value, that have 
attained economies of scale, and are very competitive. We should 
strengthen and elevate our mainstay industries and give more 
play to the superiority of our machinery and electrical, 
textile, foodstuff, chemical, building materials, construction 
and other mainstay industries. We should foster lead industries 
and focus on the electronic information industry, with the main 
emphasis on telecommunications equipment and computers; the 
machinery industry, led by communications and transportation 
equipment and engineering machinery; the chemical industry, led 
by new synthetic materials and fine chemical industry. They 
should gradually become the basis of our new industrial 
superiority. We should make use of Ningbo and other coastal 
ports as well as the existing large mainstay enterprises to 
actively develop basic raw materials industries and give impetus 
to the development of the processing industry in the hinterland. 
To speed up the restructuring, we should let ourselves be guided 
by the overall plan and give even more play to the role of 
market mechanisms. For the processing industry, regardless of 
whether it is state-owned industry, city and town collective, or 
township industry, the basic approach to restructuring is to 
establish enterprises as the main investment entities, establish 
the superior and eliminate the inferior amid market competition, 
promote the proper circulation of factors of production, and let 
urban and rural industries support and supplement one another. 
For infrastructure and basic industries that need government 
support, we must make comprehensive planning, link the state and 
the localities, and undertake construction projects on a joint 
basis. We not only must give play to the government's 
coordinating role as the main investment entity but also bring 
in market mechanisms and widen the investment fund gathering 
avenues. Qualified capital construction projects can set up 
shareholding companies to be in charge of fund gathering, 
project construction, and post-construction operations to 
industrialize the infrastructure and increase investment 
efficiency. 
  Accelerating the development of the tertiary industry 
is an important link in promoting proper industrial 
structure. Combining the characteristics of Zhejiang's 
industrial structure and development trend, we should emphasize 
the development of commercial, financial, insurance, tourist, 
and real estate industries which have large potential markets, 
great impetus, and high added-value. We should accelerate the 
development of information, technologies, law, accounting, 
auditing, assessment, consultation, and other intellectual 
services and export-oriented services. In particular, we must 
give play to Zhejiang's rich tourist resources and vigorously 
improve tourist facilities and expand the tourist network, 
improve service quality and further expand international and 
domestic tourism. We must make modernization, socialization, and 
industrialization our direction as we broadly mobilize all 
forces in society. We should make use of state, collective, 
individual, and foreign capital and make central plans, 
accentuate the important, bring in the competitive mechanisms, 
and develop the tertiary industry with speed and efficiency. 
  Four, we should implement the strategy of using science 
and education to vitalize the province and promote economic 
development and social progress. 
  Science and technology should be used in the main 
battleground of economic construction. We should put the 
emphasis on strengthening research, development, and application 
of new technologies and speed up the development of new- and 
high-tech and other industries and set up basic research. We 
should continue to carry out the "Spark," "Bumper Harvest," 
"Blazing Prairie," and "Torch" programs and "Golden Bridge" 
project. We should combine agriculture, science, and education 
and use the development and propagation of fine crop varieties 
as the breakthrough point to strengthen the comprehensive 
development and application and service capability of 
agricultural science and technologies. We should vigorously 
bring in foreign technologies and combine foreign technologies 
with our own and use new technologies, especially electronic 
technologies, to transform traditional industries. We should 
apply the principle of limiting our objective, accentuating the 
important, and giving play to our superiority to focus on 
electronic information, new materials, new energy, bio-tech, and 
integrated electronic machinery and other areas to create some 
high and new tech enterprises. We should set up new and 
high-tech industrial development zones and promote the 
commercialization and industrialization of new- and high-tech 
results. 
  We should set up a new system that is compatible with and 
promotes the development of the socialist market economy that 
complies with science and technology's own laws of development 
and closely links science and technology to the economy. We 
should abide by the guiding principle of "stabilizing one end at 
a time and opening up one parcel at a time" and strengthen basic 
and high-tech research and decontrol the research, development, 
and management activities of the technological development and 
scientific and technology service institutions. We should 
encourage the scientific and technological institutions and 
colleges and enterprises to work together on technological 
development. We should set up technology advancement mechanisms 
in enterprises to integrate the market, scientific research, and 
production, so that they become the main technology development 
entities. We should strengthen the intermediary links that turn 
science and technology into productive forces and vigorously 
develop a market for technologies and improve management, 
supervision, and service system. We should actively develop 
scientific and technological enterprises with different kinds of 
ownership formats and management methods. 
  We should put education in a strategic place to be given 
development priority and diligently implement the "The National 
Education Reform and Development Program." We should vigorously 
strengthen basic education and actively develop vocational 
education, adult education, and higher education and also 
encourage people to learn on their own, use different channels 
to nurture many skilled workers and professionals, and gradually 
develop an education system that meets the needs of economic and 
social development, so that we are ready to face the 21st 
century. Schools at all levels and of all types must abide by 
our educational guiding principles to improve the quality of 
education. We must work hard to set up some senior high schools, 
polytechnic schools, and vocational-technical schools that have 
scale efficiency, provide quality education, and are exemplary. 
We should speed up the reform of the education system and set up 
education investment mechanisms with the state's financial 
allocation playing the major role but also contain other 
fund-raising channels to create a new system where the 
government plays the main part but society also has a role in 
running the schools. We should expand the institutions of higher 
education's rights to make their own decisions, and we should 
work hard to make the schools even better, so that their size 
and structure are more reasonable and their quality and 
efficiency are improved, and we should strive to put some 
colleges in the state's "211 Project" and raise the province's 
overall educational standard and strength. 
  We must respect knowledge and talent, acquire a stronger 
sense of science and technology and education, and diligently 
implement the Party's policy toward intellectuals and the 
"Scientific and Technological Advancement Act," the "Teachers' 
Act," and other laws and rules and regulations. We should take 
effective measures to improve the intellectuals' work, study, 
and living conditions and stabilize and strengthen the science 
and technology and education contingent. We should further 
create the environment and conditions to make the most of every 
individual and to produce as many as talented people as 
possible. We should gradually install an open recruitment 
system, encourage fair competition, and promote proper 
circulation of talented people. We should warmly welcome 
personnel who study abroad to show their concern and support and 
to participate in Zhejiang's modernization and make proper 
arrangements for those who have returned and formulate policies 
to make it free and convenient for people to come and go. We 
should increase input in science and technology and education. 
Input in science and technology which accounts for around 1 
percent of the GDP today should be increased to more than 2 
percent; input in education should be increased from around 2 
percent of the GDP today to around 4 percent. 
  Five, we should give play to local superiorities and 
promote coordinated regional economic development. 
  Based on regional economic and geographic characteristics 
and 
conditions and using the core cities and transportation 
trunklines, we should gradually develop economic districts of 
different characters. We should follow the State Council's 
Changjiang Delta and Changjiang river bank regional economic 
plan, put the emphasis along the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo 
Highway, make plans to develop them first and further expand the 
pattern of opening up. We must give full play to Hangzhou's 
economic, scientific and technological, and cultural superiority 
and increase its influence as provincial capital city. We should 
accelerate the construction of transportation and shipping lines 
from Beilun to the interior, making it one of the major ports 
that brings the Changjiang Delta to the international markets. 
We should further develop and utilize Ningbo and the Zhoushan 
deep-water maritime space to gradually form a large 
international entrepot and turn Ningbo into a major commercial 
port and heavy and chemical industries base in East China. We 
should give full play to the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, 
Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Zhoushan prefectures' existing economic 
superiority and rely on the core cities and take advantage of 
their locale, which link northern Zhejiang to Pudong, and make 
an earnest effort to strengthen the technological transformation 
of traditional industries and old enterprises and develop rising 
industries to gradually form an economic belt that is even more 
externally oriented and technologically advanced. For Wenzhou 
and Taizhou and other coastal areas, we should actively give 
play to Wenzhou's role as an open city and speed up Taizhou's 
core city construction. We should take advantage of their 
existing fairly flexible enterprise mechanisms and their ability 
to respond quickly to market changes, develop the industrial 
space along the coast and the highway, work hard to upgrade 
industries quickly to form a superior industrial zone that face 
the domestic and foreign markets and emphasize "light, small, 
and fine" industries as a characteristic. For the region along 
the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway and Jinhua-Wenzhou railway, we 
should give full play to transportation's ability to bring 
things together and give impetus to the economy and develop the 
relatively rich local natural resources and further develop the 
processing industry, developm ental agriculture, and the service 
industry. We should actively open up the border economy and 
strengthen Zhejiang's impact as the great western door. We 
should strengthen the central city construction of Jinhua, 
Quzhou, and Lishui prefectures and give play to their 
superiorities and speed up development to gradually form an 
economic corridor that goes through the three prefectures all 
the way to the coast. 
  While strengthening core city construction and raising the 
level of urbanization, we should seize two focal points and 
accelerate county economic development. One, we must vigorously 
develop township enterprises and make them much more advanced. 
Township enterprises play an important role in the county 
economy, and they must change their operating mechanisms and 
adopt a new property rights system and management methods to 
further increase their vitality. We must accelerate their 
technological transformation, promote technological progress, 
and give play to the exemplary role of Shaoxing's small light 
and textile and machinery and electronics 
Spark-technology-intensive zones and promote high quality 
products and higher management standard and economic efficiency. 
Through the circulation and recombination of factors of 
production, we should develop a group of large and medium-sized 
and externally oriented mainstay enterprises and optimize the 
enterprise organizational structure to create an even better 
enterprise setup. For Zhejiang's southwestern region and the 
minority nationality regions, we must adopt even more versatile 
policies and give them active support and accelerate the 
development of township enterprises. Two, we must accelerate 
rural town and township construction, strengthen the planning 
and management of township construction, and promote the 
gathering of factors of production in the small towns and 
townships. We must focus our energy on turning the county towns 
into small cities; a handful of the qualified towns should be 
turned into mid-sized cities. We should support and develop some 
larger towns and townships at different levels and expand their 
jurisdiction and give full play to their role as links and to 
their ability to impact others. The development of rural market 
town should be linked to the development of small industrial 
zones and markets. Every industry's own characteristics, the 
flow of commodities, and human tradition should be taken into 
consideration, and the existing market towns as backdrop, we 
should design a proper pattern and form a net work. Construction 
of town and township infrastructure should rely mainly on the 
strength of the masses of peasants; we should let the "peasants 
build peasant towns and townships." 
  We should gradually reform the household registration system 
in the small cities and towns and attract peasants to the cities 
and towns to work in industries or do business, speed up the 
transfer of surplus rural labor, gather the agricultural product 
processing industry and other township enterprises in the small 
cities and towns, and give impetus to the development of the 
service industries in the rural areas. 
  We should speed up island and maritime development and 
gradually grow a large maritime economy in the province. We 
should cultivate a stronger sense of the maritime territory, 
maritime economy, and maritime environment. We should insist on 
using opening up to promote development and make unified plans 
and implement them in steps. We should take advantage of our 
location and our resources and let ports, fishery, industry, 
trade, and tourism promote one another while focusing on the 
development of ocean shipping industry, ocean aquatic industry, 
ocean-front industry, island tourism, and domestic and foreign 
trade. At the same time, we should emphasize and actively 
support the rising maritime industry, especially the development 
of new and high-tech maritime industry, and get organized to 
develop our superiority in maritime industry. We should boldly 
utilize foreign and domestic funds, set aside entire islands for 
development, increase input in maritime development and island 
infrastructure through various channels and at different levels 
to gradually set up some lively and vigorous island and maritime 
development operating mechanisms. 
  We should strengthen construction in the mountain areas and 
open up wider both to the inside and outside. We should further 
loosen our policies and increase input through more channels, 
and starting with improving the production and living 
conditions, we can plan some infrastructure projects and give 
the area special support and consideration in terms of 
technology and human and financial resources. Constructions in 
the mountain areas must be based on self-reliance. We must 
endure hardship, suit measures to local conditions, and give 
play to local superior factors to enhance their developmental 
capability. We should bring in funds, technologies, talents from 
the big cities, large enterprises, colleges and universities, 
and science and research institutions. We should emphasize 
development along the highway and along the river and give play 
to the ability of small market towns to bring along the economy; 
develop developmental agriculture, processing industry, and 
service industries; and raise the comprehensive economic 
development standards. 
  We must step up our poverty-relief efforts and strive to 
solve the basic food and shelter problems of people in the 
poverty-stricken regions, the old liberated areas, and the 
reservations quickly and steadily, so that they can become 
relatively well-off by the end of the century. Zhejiang's poor 
regions are mostly in the mountain areas, and besides carrying 
out the state's policies toward the mountain area, we must 
continue to practice a series of proven-effective poverty-relief 
methods by linking departments and localities, through science 
and technologies, through funding, and through regular contacts 
with leading cadres. We must meet the needs of the development 
of socialist market economy, further broaden our thinking, and 
take even more effective measures and get organized as we make 
our assault. One, while we continue to do a better 
poverty-relief job, we should encourage people to go elsewhere 
and leave the mountains, utilize the developed region's economic 
and social advantages to organize labor export, and gather the 
factors of production in the developed regions to open 
industrial and commercial enterprises. Two, through policy 
guidance, we can seize the opportunity as the economically 
better-developed coastal regions are upgrading their industries 
to shift labor-intensive industries and products to the 
poverty-stricken areas. Three, while fully respecting the 
masses' wishes and making sure that they have steady income, we 
should gradually move some of the poor villages and poor 
households from the high mountain areas that have no chance of 
developing to areas along the highway and the river and to the 
river basin and the market towns to develop production and 
escape poverty. Four, we should perfect the poverty-relief fund 
input mechanisms, utilize the poverty-relief funds centrally, 
increase fund-use efficiency, and make an effort to increase our 
ability to "make new blood." 
  Six, we should promote socialist democracy and 
legislation, maintain an orderly economic environment, and 
protect social and economic stability. 
  We should further improve the people's congress system and 
strengthen the legislative and supervisory functions of the 
people's congress and its standing committee. In accordance 
with the Constitution and the party constitution, we should 
acquire a better understanding on upholding and perfecting the 
basic political system of the people's congress, make sure that 
the people's congress and its standing committee can carry out 
their duties according to the law, diligently protect the 
people's right to oversee the state's and society's affairs, and 
give even more play to the role of the people's representatives. 
We should strengthen leadership in legislative work and pay 
attention to the legislative program and standardize the 
legislative process to meet the needs of the socialist market 
economic development and strengthen the legislative system's 
ability to guide, discipline, protect, and restrain. In heeding 
the Party Central Committee, giving expression to the reform 
spirit, and making promoting the development of the productive 
forces our objective, we should take Zhejiang's realistic 
situation into consideration and focus on laws and regulations 
to standardize the market entities' behavior, preserve market 
order, strengthen regulation and control and management, improve 
public security, and promote the opening up to the outside 
world. At the same time, we must attach importance to 
legislations pertaining to the construction of the spiritual 
civilization and honest government, protection of the citizens' 
rights, and preservation of public security; we must handle 
everything according to the law. We must launch universal legal 
education in a planned and systematic way at different levels 
and aiming at different targets. We should make it a point to 
disseminate basic legal knowledge about the market economy and 
diligently increase the masses of cadres' and the public's legal 
knowledge and legal consciousness. Party organizations at all 
levels and CPC members should set the example and implement the 
constitution and the law and insist on doing everything 
according to the law. 
  We should reinforce and develop a patriotic united front for 
the new era, perfect the system of multi-party cooperation and 
political consultation under the CPC's leadership, and give full 
play to the people's consultative conference in political 
consultation and democratic supervision roles. We must uphold 
the guiding principle of "permanent coexistence, mutual 
supervision, utter devotion, and sharing of honors and disgrace" 
and increase consultation and discussion with the democratic 
parties and factions and select and arrange for members of 
democratic parties and non-party-affiliated personages to serve 
in leading positions in state organs and work with them. We 
should further reinforce the coalition of the entire body of 
socialist workers, patriots who support socialism, and patriots 
who support the unification of the fatherland. We should educate 
the masses of party members, especially the leading cadres at 
all levels, on united front theory and general and specific 
policies in the new era and create good conditions for the 
democratic parties and factions and mass organizations and 
patriotic personages to participate in government and discuss 
politics. We should seriously implement the party's policy 
toward religion and strengthen the administration of religious 
matters in accordance with the law and actively provide guidance 
to make religion compatible with socialism. We should fully 
implement the party's policies toward the nationalities, 
overseas Chinese, and Taiwan and do good overseas united front 
work. We should mobilize all positive factors to help Zhejiang 
Province accelerate its reform and opening up and economic 
construction. 
  We should set up a scientific, democratic decision-making 
procedure and system and amplify democracy; open up more avenues 
for free speech; listen to the ordinary people expressing their 
opinions, criticisms, and suggestions about the party and the 
government; and increase the masses' participation in 
government. When making decisions on major policy measures and 
construction projects affecting the province's economy, we must 
first solicit suggestions from society, including all kinds of 
experts and research and consultation organizations, and 
carefully conduct feasibility studies and scientific debates. We 
must strengthen grass-roots democratic construction and 
diligently give play to the roles of the workers' representative 
assembly, the residents committee, and the villagers committee. 
  We should uphold the people's democratic dictatorship, 
strictly apply the Constitution and the law, protect social and 
political stability, and do a good job with the comprehensive 
administration of public security. We should reinforce law 
enforcement and judicial work, protect the people's courts' and 
procuratorates' independence in carrying out their duties 
according to the law, and legally protect the people's right and 
preserve social order and punish all sorts of criminal elements, 
so as to serve reform and opening up and the economic 
construction. Party committees and governments at all levels 
must set up a comprehensive public security leadership 
responsibility system to strengthen leadership in public 
security work. We must uphold the guiding principle of 
integrating the specialized work under the party committee's 
leadership and the mass line, emphasize crackdown and 
prevention, deal with the symptoms as well as the causes, 
strengthen comprehensive administration of public 
security--putting the emphasis at the grass-roots level, and 
practice comprehensive administration and 
management-by-objective. We should properly handle the people's 
internal contradiction and pay close attention to the serious 
problems that can jeopardize social stability during reform and 
opening up. We should comply with the laws and policies in 
regulating various economic and social relations, take the 
initiative to do a good job, attach importance to the masses' 
letters and visits, nip all problems in the bud, and solve all 
problems at the grass-roots level. We should focus on serious 
public security problems and promptly organize efforts to 
struggle against specific and key problems. We should impose 
severe punishment on criminal elements committing serious penal 
and economic crimes and wipe out society's many ugly and evil 
phenomena. We should attach importance to national security work 
and set up a people's defense line to preserve national security 
and crack down on activities of subversion and sabotage 
instigated by hostile forces at home and abroad. We should 
strengthen the political and legal departments' own construction 
and improve the quality of the cadres and police and the 
standards of law enforcement. We should launch national defense 
education to strengthen the people's national defense concept. 
We should uphold the principle that the Party is in charge of 
the military, strengthen militia reserve duty, and do a good job 
with the people's armed forces and air defense. We should 
support the army and give preferential treatment to families of 
revolutionary soldiers and martyrs and show concern and support 
for the troops stationed in Zhejiang. 
  Seven, uphold the guiding principle of emphasizing 
construction and put socialist spiritual construction onto a 
higher plane. 
  We must wrap tightly around the core of economic 
construction, adapt to the new situation and new tasks, and 
strengthen and improve spiritual civilization. We must 
diligently implement the "Zhejiang Socialist Spiritual 
Civilization Construction Program (1993-2000)," focus on the new 
situation and new issues, promptly study policy measures, 
continuously make new demands at every stage, emphasize 
implementation, strive for periodic results, and maintain the 
coordinated development of the two civilizations. 
  We should make improving human quality the core while 
strengthening ideological and moral constructions. We should 
insist on using Marxism and Mao Zedong thoughts and especially 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on constructing a socialism with 
Chinese characteristics to guide the people's thoughts and 
action. We must further liberate our thinking and smash the 
"leftist" and old ideological bondage, reinforce the idea of 
reform and opening up, and establish new ideas and new concepts 
that are compatible with the socialist market economy. We should 
encourage the theoreticians to go deep into society's real 
situation and focus on the major theories and practical issues 
pertaining to the construction of a socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, utilize Marxist stand, viewpoint, and method to 
launch their studies with creativity, strengthen their theories, 
and let philosophy and the social sciences flourish. We should 
vigorously disseminate Marxism and continue to educate the 
masses on patriotism, collectivism, and socialist education. We 
should go deep with our propaganda and amplify the new era's 
pioneering spirit advocated by Comrade Jiang Zemin and be ready 
to make contributions and to struggle arduously. We should 
increase the nationalities' self-respect, self-confidence, and 
self-reliance; uphold a correct outlook on life and value and 
advocate civilized and healthy lifestyle; resist the corrosion 
of capitalism and corrupt feudal ideologies; take a clear stand 
against money worship, extreme individualism, and corrupt 
lifestyles. We must get a firm grip on professional ethics and 
social moral education and advocate unity and mutual aid and 
respect for the old and love for the young. We must boldly stand 
up for what is right and get rid of outdated conventions and bad 
customs, transform social customs, propagate atheism and oppose 
feudal superstition, and foster good social customs. We must 
attach great importance to educating young people on our 
revolutionary tradition, ideologies and character, and the legal 
system. The schools, families, and society should work closely 
together to nurture a new generation of people who have 
ideologies, morality, culture, and discipline. We should improve 
the content and method of conducting ideological and political 
work and find even more effective ways and means and channels to 
filter through and mix ideological and political education int o 
different aspects of reform and opening up and economic 
construction and fully mobilize people's enthusiasm. 
  We should broadly launch spiritual civilization construction 
activities and increase the masses' participation rate. Our 
spiritual civilization must give expression to the spirit of 
doing concrete work and getting concrete results. They should be 
in forms that the masses enjoy and appreciate and are tightly 
linked with and are crucial to the masses' work and life. We 
should continue to widely hold civilized-city-founding 
competition and sponsor activities to create civilized cities 
and towns, civilized units, and civilized small zones; hold 
activities to encourage "five-good" families and to unite the 
army with the people and the police with the people. We should 
actively make the communities, villages and townships, 
enterprises, and campuses more civilized and give civilization 
new substance under the new situation and bring spiritual 
civilization to the grass-roots in town and country. Spiritual 
civilization construction is every department's and everybody's 
business, and we must give full play to the positive roles of 
the party, government, and military committees; the workers, 
youth, and women's committees; old people's committees, other 
working committees, and urban and rural enterprises and 
institutions concerned about the next generation in the 
construction of spiritual civilization. 
  We should uphold the direction of "serving the people and 
serving socialism" and the guiding principle of "letting a 
hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought 
contend" to help socialist cultural undertakings flourish. We 
should give full play to Zhejiang's cultural superiority, 
continue to amplify the nationalities' fine cultural traditions, 
absorb the fine results of world culture, and strive to create 
even more and even better spiritual products that reflect the 
rhythm of the times, and at the same time, we should pay 
attention to diversity to satisfy the masses' different, 
multi-level, healthy, and progressive spiritual needs. We should 
develop literature, arts, news, publication, broadcast, movies 
and television and other cultural undertakings and correctly 
handle the relationship between social benefits and economic 
benefits while putting social benefits first. We should attach 
importance to propaganda and public opinion, uphold the 
principle of party spirit, firmly establish the mass viewpoint, 
integrate the party's responsibilities with the people's 
responsibilities, and correctly ascertain the direction of 
public opinion. We should mainly use positive propaganda; make 
unity, stability, and agitation the theme; and give full play to 
the functions of propaganda, unity, education, and incentive 
among the masses. We should set up and improve all types of laws 
and regulations and systems and strengthen the administration of 
the cultural market and clean up spiritual garbage and negative 
and corrupt phenomena. 
  We should attach importance to input into spiritual 
civilization construction and guarantee yearly increases. The 
construction of the spiritual civilization's "hardware" should 
be included in the nation's economic and social development 
plans. We should formulate and implement cultural and economic 
policies to widely attract funds, including winning civilian 
support and attracting foreign capital, to gradually form a 
multi-level, multi-formatted spiritual civilization construction 
pattern where the state, enterprises, institutions, and 
individuals all play a part. 
  Eight, we should attach importance to population 
control and environmental protection and improve the quality of 
life. 
  In addition to developing the economy, we must continuously 
improve living conditions in the cities and the countryside. We 
must open up the production sectors and increase employment 
opportunities. We should gradually set up a wage system and a 
normal wage increase mechanism that is consistent with the 
characteristics of respective enterprises and institutions and 
various organs to increase the workers' actual income. We should 
strengthen commodity price management and keep the price level 
under control to protect the consumers' interests. We should do 
a good job with the market basket project and make a vigorous 
effort to build urban nonstaple foodstuff and vegetable 
production bases and improve the supply situation. We must show 
concern for the low-income workers and do a good disaster-relief 
and poverty-relief job. We must attach importance to reducing 
the peasants' burdens, lower production cost, and increase 
agriculture's economic efficiency, increase the peasant's income 
in various ways, and narrow the income gap between the urban and 
rural population. We must provide primary-level public health 
and health care in the rural areas and further develop urban and 
rural medical and sanitation and athletic undertakings and 
improve the people's health standard and their physical 
condition. We should pay attention to the construction of urban 
and rural public utilities and continue to improve housing 
conditions in the cities and towns. We must make improving the 
filthy, chaotic, and poor conditions the focal point and work on 
the greening, the beautification, and the cleaning up of the 
urban areas. We should make changing the water supply and the 
lavatory conditions the focal point in improving rural 
environment and sanitation condition, strengthen village and 
township construction plans, and improve the appearances of the 
villages. We should strengthen environ mental protection 
concepts; tackle environmental pollution problems; protect and 
properly utilize the land, mineral resources, forests, and water 
and other natural resources; and gradually improve the ecology 
and the environment. 
  We should continue to work diligently on family planning and 
make sure that we can reach the population control goals. We 
must insist on producing healthy babies and bringing them up in 
a good environment to improve the quality of the population. All 
businesses and industrie s and everybody must comply with the 
law and do a good job with family planning, take full 
responsibility, "veto by one vote," take other tough measures, 
and improve the minority nationalities' family planning work. We 
should study the question of population control under market 
economic conditions and strengthen the control of the mobile 
population. We should focus on Zhejiang's accelerated change in 
population-mix, actively study and resolve all the problems 
brought by the aging population, and include our gerontological 
undertakings in the social development program. 
<H5>  IV. Strengthen and Improve Party Leadership </H5>
  The key to speeding up reform and opening up and promoting 
socialist modernization and thoroughly and correctly 
implementing the party's basic line lies in proper party 
construction. In the new historical era, the party will find 
itself in a new environment and face very different tasks. In 
the wake of the development of the socialist market economic 
system and the expansion of our opening up to the outside world, 
the economic, political, cultural, and other aspects of society 
as well as the people's thinking and concepts, value, and 
behavior will necessarily change dramatically too. These not 
only will bring new life and vitality to party construction but 
will also pose new problems. We must take the initiative to 
adjust to the changing situation and tasks and accept the new 
tests. Guided by the theory of constructing a socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, and heeding 
the 14th National Party Congress, we must insist that the party 
is in control of the party, and we must administer the party 
strictly, strengthen party construction, carry on the party's 
fine tradition, actively explore new ideas and new methods, 
strive to raise the party's governing and leadership standards, 
and turn the province's party organizations at all levels into 
strong leadership cores and fortresses to accelerate the reform 
and opening up and the socialist modernization construction. 
  One, we must strengthen ideological construction and 
firmly insist on arming the province's party members and cadres 
with the theory of building a socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  Studying Marxism and Mao Zedong thought and arming the party 
with the theory of constructing a socialism with Chinese 
characteristics are the most basic of the party's ideological 
and theoretical construction tasks and the most fundamental work 
in strengthening and improving party construction, and they are 
also basic means to enhance our self-consciousness and 
steadfastness in implementing the party's basic line and to 
achieve a high degree of ideological and political unanimity. We 
must thoroughly and systematically study this theory and truly 
understand the nine theoretical viewpoints and principles summed 
up in the 14th National Party Congress's report, so that all 
party members, especially the party's leading cadres, can 
further reaffirm their conviction in socialism and communism and 
continuously improve their ideological and political quality and 
work standard. 
  The publication, Volume 3 Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, was a major event in the party and the state's 
political life. Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping is 
the most important and most creative work in the course of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's formulation and development of the 
theory on constructing a socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
It is the theoretical summation of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's rich 
experience in leading the reform and opening up and the 
socialist modernization. It is the continuation and extension of 
Mao Zedong thoughts; it is contemporary Chinese Marxism; it is a 
scientific guide as we continue to push forward. Today, in 
studying the theory on constructing a socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, the focus should be on studying Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping. Party organizations at all levels 
must follow the Central Party Committee's and the provincial 
party committee's program and be diligent in their study and 
propaganda work. 
  We must tightly link our study with reality and seriously 
study the original work and grasp its spiritual essence. We must 
integrate studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic ideas and 
theoretical viewpoints with the study of his scientific 
attitude, creative spirit, and revolutionary style and link the 
study of Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, to the 
total embodiment of the spirit of the 14th National Party 
Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central 
Committee. We should further deepen our understanding of the 
ideological line of liberating our thinking and seeking truth 
from facts and the essence of socialism and the party's basic 
line, smash the backward traditional concepts and subjective 
prejudices, change the state of mind of sticking to old ways, 
increase the tempering of party spirit, increase the sense of 
principle, system, and farsightedness and creativity in our 
work, and strive to raise our Marxist theory standard. The 
socialist market economic theory is an important part of the 
construction of a socialism with Chinese characteristics. We 
must link the practices of reform and opening up to the 
successful experiences of foreign economic development, study 
hard, and quickly grasp the basic theories, basic laws, and 
basic knowledge of socialist market economy and increase our 
ability to study new situations, solve new problems, and create 
new patterns. 
  Leading cadres at all levels, especially leading cadres at 
above county department level, must take the lead in conducting 
industrious studies and meticulous research. They must be good 
at theoretical reasoning and applying what they have learned and 
set an example to give impetus to the masses of cadres and CPC 
members in their studies. We should continue to uphold the 
system of setting up party committee theory study central groups 
at different levels and the system of training leading cadre and 
link the leading cadres' on-the-job study and their 
away-from-production training. Party committee propaganda and 
organizational departments at all levels must strengthen their 
guidance, supervision, and examination in the studies. Party 
schools and cadre schools at all levels must make gathering the 
cadres to study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on constructing a 
socialism with Chinese characteristics the main topic of cadre 
training. Education in Marxist theory in the colleges should 
also be strengthened and improved ac cordingly. The masses of 
people engaged in propaganda and theory work must intensify 
their study of and give even more publicity to the theory of 
constructing a socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Two, strictly implement the system of democratic 
centralism and guarantee the party's unity and integrity. 
  Democratic centralism is the party's and the state's basic 
system. Only by strictly implementing democratic centralism and 
amplifying the party's internal political life can we pool the 
wisdom of the province's party organizations at all levels and 
of the masses of party members, reach a consensus on all major 
issues relevant to the people's basic interests, increase unity, 
and maintain unanimity in action, so that we can be sure that 
our decisions are correct and our implementation effective and 
the party's combat capability is enhanced. 
  When upholding democratic centralism, we must practice the 
kind of centralism that is based on democracy and the kind of 
democracy that is centrally guided. We must emphasize further 
amplifying democracy and actively dredge and expand democratic 
channels within the party. We must know how to listen to 
different ideas and diligently protect the democratic rights of 
organizations at all levels and all party members as stipulated 
by the party constitution. Important situations that affect the 
big picture must be reported to the party promptly, and the 
party's opinion must be solicited before making important 
decisions. This should be turned into a system. The party 
members and leading cadres must have good democratic workstyle. 
Party committees at all levels must uphold and amplify the 
system of collective leadership. All major issues must be 
thoroughly discussed, and decisions should be made collectively. 
Individuals must resolutely carry out the collective decisions 
and not do as they please. We must correctly handle the 
relationship between individuals and the organization. No 
individual is above the organization. We must strictly abide by 
the party's organizational principles and political discipline. 
Individuals must submit to the organization; minority must 
submit to the majority; subordinates must submit to their 
superior; the party must submit to the Party Central Committee. 
We must firmly oppose liberalism and rectify the absence of 
organization and discipline. We must consciously maintain a high 
degree of unanimity with the Party Central Committee in 
ideologies, on political matters, and in action to preserve the 
Party Central Committee's authoritativeness. In particular, as 
the interest pattern adjusts to the deepening reform, it is even 
more important that we take the whole situation into 
consideration and insist that the parts submit to the whole and 
make sure that government orders are not obstructed and orders 
and prohibitions are strictly obeyed. We should strive to create 
a centralized but democratic and disciplined but free political 
pattern which represents unified will but also expresses 
individual wishes and which is lively and energetic. 
  Party unity is the party's life. Leading cadres at all 
levels, especially the important leading cadres in the party and 
government, must set the example of unity, strictly abide by the 
party constitution and various regulations that set the norms 
for the party's political life, amplify the party's system of 
holding meetings on democratic life, actively engage in 
criticism and self-criticism, and increase unity by upholding 
party spirit principles. We must put the party's undertakings 
first and never get entangled in personal grievances. We must 
trust one another, support one another, understand one another, 
work together with one heart, and diligently increase the 
leading groups' solidarity and combat capabilities. We should 
enhance the unity between new and veteran party comrades. The 
young comrades must respect the veteran comrades and sincerely 
heed their suggestions. The old comrades must show concern for, 
understand, and love the young comrades and support their work 
warmheartedly. Under the leadership of the party committee, we 
must unite the party from within and without. 
  Three, strengthen the construction of the leading 
groups and increase our ability to master the whole 
situation. 
  Building leading groups at all levels is the basic guarantee 
of the thorough implementation of the party's basic line and is 
also the key link in strengthening and improving party 
construction. We must work hard to turn the leading groups at 
all levels into strong leading collectives that are true to 
Marxism, that insist on embarking on the road of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, that have the courage to reform and are 
pragmatic in its creativity. They must be unified and 
harmonious, hard-working and honest, and must be able to 
maintain a close relationship with the masses. 
  Leading groups at all levels must firmly establish the idea 
of making economic construction the core and "grasping with both 
hands" to strengthen leadership in socialist modernization. We 
should follow the Party Central Committee's macro decisions, 
know how to make use of international and domestic situations as 
well as local conditions to determine the strategic goals and 
work ideas for economic and social development, formulate 
important general and specific policies for reform and opening 
up and for the construction of the two civilizations, and make 
important decisions and plans on major issues that impact the 
overall pattern of the era. We must amplify the democratic and 
scientific decision-making system and make investigation and 
study the basis of success and the road to new opportunities. We 
should know how to sum up our experience, improve leadership 
methods, broaden our knowledge, understand the whole situation, 
learn economics, attain professional proficiency, and raise the 
leading groups' overall standard in discussing major issues, 
managing the big picture, and making important decisions. We 
should give full play to the party committees as the leading 
core and strengthen and improve the leadership of the people's 
congress, the government, and the political consultative 
conference. We should put economic construction at the center, 
take the overall situation into consideration, coordinate all 
aspects, and mobilize all positive factors to form a cohesive 
force. 
  We must uphold the guiding principle of nurturing 
"revolutionary, young, intellectual, and professional" cadres 
and the principle of emphasizing both ability and moral when 
selecting and appointing cadres. Cadres who resolutely implement 
the party's basic line, who have a strong sense of revolutionary 
undertaking and a strong sense of responsibility in serving the 
people, who have outstanding accomplishments in reform and 
opening up and the modernization construction, and who are 
demanding of themselves and have earned the trust of the masses 
should be assigned to important posts. Cadres who are 
incompetent at their present jobs and who are irresponsible must 
be demoted. We should encourage the cadres to make bold attempts 
in reform and make new breakthroughs. We should sincerely help 
those who have flaws or have made mistakes at work. We should 
help them review their experiences and lessons to keep up the 
cadres' enthusiasm. We should uphold the principle that the 
party controls the cadres, and when choosing and appointing 
cadres, we must amplify democracy and uphold the mass line and 
do everything according to regulated procedure. We must smash 
the outmoded concepts of dwelling on seniority and rank and 
always demanding perfection; instead, we should broaden our 
outlook and widen the channels of hiring. We should hire people 
from all corners of the land based only on merits and must avoid 
and resist all unhealthy tendencies in employment. Those who 
have a serious problem with individualism and always demand good 
jobs must never be put in important positions. From the 
strategic high point of modernization, we should select many 
fine young and middle-aged cadres and continue to attach 
importance to building a contingent of reserve cadres and 
vigorously nurture successors to the socialist undertaking in 
the next century. We should attach great importance to nurturing 
and promoting woman cadres and minority nationality cadres and 
actively promote the reform of the cadre personnel system to 
meet the needs of the socialist market economy. We should bring 
in competition and incentive mechanisms and insist that cadres 
work at the top and the bottom, and we should implement the 
cadre exchange system. W e should diligently implement the cadre 
on-leave and retirement systems and show concern for them 
politically and in everyday life, so that they can still 
accomplish something and pass their old age in peace. We should 
take practical steps to show concern in every way we can for the 
veteran party members in the rural areas. 
  Four, strengthen grass-roots party organization 
construction and give full play to the CPC members' vanguard 
role. 
  The party's grass-roots organizations are at the frontline 
of 
reform and opening up and the socialist modernization. They are 
the basis of the party's work and combat strength. We should 
take the different characteristics of the villages, enterprises, 
schools, and organs into consideration to strengthen the 
grass-roots organizations' own construction and increase their 
combat strength as we reform and open up and develop the 
economy. In the rural areas, township (town) party committees 
and village party branches must make developing rural productive 
forces and leading the peasants toward the goal of becoming 
relatively well-off the focus of their work; they must tightly 
integrate them with the realities of rural economic construction 
and reform and opening up, do a better job with the 
village-level organizational setup that centers around the party 
branches, and bring their core leadership role into play as we 
go all out to promote rural economic and social development. 
Enterprise party organizations must revolve around accelerating 
the change in management mechanisms and gradually set up a 
modern enterprise system and tightly integrate it into the 
production and management activities, strengthen 
ideological-political work, and nurture a contingent of workers 
with the "four haves"--[ideal, moral, culture, and discipline], 
so that they can participate in enterprises' major decisions and 
guarantee and supervise the implementation of the party's and 
the state's general and specific policies toward enterprises and 
manifest their political core role. Party organizations in the 
schools must thoroughly implement the party's educational 
guiding principle and actively promote education reform and 
development. Their basic task should be to nurture builders and 
successors of socialist undertakings who are moralistic, 
intelligent, and physically-fit. Party organizations in 
government offices must help the administrative leaders complete 
their tasks and play a positive role especially in helping to 
change their functions and workstyle, in serving the 
grass-roots, stepping up supervision, and providing guarantees. 
  In the wake of reform and opening up and the development of 
the socialist market economy, economic entities of different 
economic makeup, organizational format, and management systems 
have greatly increased, and the production and management styles 
have changed dramatically. Construction of grass-roots party 
organizations must also adjust to the new situation and make 
appropriate changes in terms of organization installation, 
content of work, types of activities, leadership methods and so 
on. We must carry on and amplify our fine traditions but also 
actively explore new methods and sum up new experiences. We must 
diligently review the management-by-objective of party branch 
work implemented in recent years, launch such activities as 
"double strive, double evaluate" and "becoming fairly well-off 
villages," and meld grass-roots party construction, spiritual 
civilization, and economic construction into one whole 
experience. We should sum up the experience of giving play to 
the vanguard role of the masses of party members through the 
party member discussion meetings, obligation groups, 
responsibility districts, and contact households in the 
construction of the two civilizations. We should sum up the 
party construction experience of the township enterprises, the 
three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises, shareholding 
cooperative enterprises, and private enterprises and further 
promote grass-roots party construction work and continuously 
make improvements in practice. 
  We should build a stronger contingent of party members and 
continuously improve party member quality. We should educate the 
masses of party members on upholding party spirit principles and 
maintaining the party's progressive nature. We must correctly 
handle the relationship between implementing the party's 
existing policies and upholding the party's ideals and purpose 
and the relationship between reform and breakthroughs and 
strengthening party discipline. We must not let commodity 
exchange principles infiltrate the party's political life. We 
should turn the party members into progress elements who firmly 
implement the party's basic line, who have the courage to 
sacrifice themselves for the sake of reform and opening up and 
the modernization undertaking, who wholeheartedly work for the 
good of the people, who lead the masses in their arduous 
struggle, and who make selfless sacrifices and contribute to the 
economic development and social progress. We must abide by the 
party constitution, uphold the new era's party member standards, 
diligently recruit party members, and actively nurture and 
promptly recruit into the party fine elements who have political 
consciousness, who are young, educated, able, and have solid 
accomplishments; we must pay special attention to recruiting 
woman party members. In enterprises, we must attach importance 
to recruiting party members from among the firstline production 
workers and business mainstay and management personnel and 
gradually solve the current problem of the absence of party 
members in many production groups and organizations. In the 
rural areas, we should pay attention to localities where no 
party members have been recruited for a long time, where party 
members have become an aging group, and where village-level 
groups have no successors. We need fine young people who have 
good political ideology quality, who are economically-minded, 
and who are fairly well-educated. In colleges, we should attach 
importance to recruiting party members from among the fine 
young teachers, department heads, and active elements among the 
students. 
  Five, tighten the blood relations between the party and 
the people and persevere in our anti-corruption struggles 
  Party workstyle and honest government are issues that decide 
whether the people will support or rebel against us, whether 
reform and construction will succeed, and whether the party will 
survive or perish. We must fully recognize the urgency, 
permanence, and the arduous and complicated nature of our 
anti-corruption struggle. We must make protecting the state and 
the people's basic interests the starting point and firmly and 
steadfastly oppose corruption during reform and opening up. We 
must make a firm decision to eliminate graft and perversion of 
justice, giving and taking bribes, extortion and blackmail, 
buying power with money, squandering the people's wealth, 
corrosion and degeneration and other negative and corrupt 
phenomena, and we must diligently rectify all sorts of unhealthy 
tendencies. Anti-corruption struggles must revolve around 
economic construction and serve reform and development. We must 
focus on the long-term and plant our foothold on the present and 
do concrete and honest work to continuously set goals for each 
period. We are determined to get results and win the people's 
trust. 
  The key to good party workstyle and honesty in government 
lies in unifying the ideologies of leaders at all levels. We 
must fully understand the importance, necessity, and urgency of 
good party workstyle and honesty in government and the 
anti-corruption struggles and put the task on top of the agenda 
of party committees at every level and work diligently on it. 
First, we must begin with the leading organs and leading cadres 
at all levels. Each level should grab hold of another, and one 
level should give impetus to another. Party members and leading 
cadres at above county-level must strictly abide by the five 
requirements reiterated and set down by the Party Central Commi 
ttee, discipline themselves, take the lead in setting an 
example, and using themselves as role models; they must set high 
standards for their family and children and for people who work 
around them. We must firmly and promptly investigate and 
prosecute major and important cases, remove interferences, 
investigate thoroughly and punish the corrupt elements harshly; 
we must never be softhearted, because to tolerate evil is to 
abet it. We must always seek truth from facts and handle all 
cases according to t he law, ascertain the nature of the 
problems, and have a firm grasp on the policies. We must always 
be ready to tackle the unhealthy business tendencies that crop 
up at different times and the people's strong reactions to those 
practices and deal with them specifically in a timely fashion to 
ensure concrete results. 
  To punish and cure corruption, we must deal with the 
symptoms 
and the cause of the disease at the same time. Basically 
speaking, we must concentrate on education and the legal system. 
We must continuously educate the masses of party members and 
cadres on party ideologies, program, purpose, discipline, and 
the fine party workstyle. We must further improve the party 
members' and cadres' ideological and political quality, increase 
their ability to resist the corrosive ideologies of the 
exploitation class, and diligently review our practical 
experiences in the anti-corruption struggles. We must 
concentrate on the parts and links that are most susceptible to 
corruption, eliminate flaws, and plug loopholes. We must set up 
and amplify an internal management system and supervisory and 
restraining mechanisms, perfect the policies and laws and 
regulations, and rely on the system and the legal system to 
solve the corruption problem. We must enhance the leading 
groups' ability to discover and solve their own problems. We 
should strengthen the party organizations and disciplinary 
inspection organs' organized supervision of the party members 
and cadres, strengthen the masses and the democratic parties' 
and factions' and the non-party-affiliated personages' 
democratic supervision of our party, and strengthen the people's 
congresses and the judicial and procuratorial and auditing 
departments' legislative supervision with regard to honest 
government. We should give play to public opinion's supervisory 
role and set up a supervisory system inside and out, at the top 
and below. Party committees must strengthen leadership in the 
judicial and law enforcement departments, show support for their 
work, and gradually improve the work conditions in these 
departments. 
  Leading cadres at all levels must uphold the party's mass 
line and diligently improve their leadership style. We must 
strive to do what Comrade Jiang Zemin asked of us, to "squeeze 
more time into studying and spend less time on socializing; 
spend more time on investigation and studies and less on 
subjectivism; do more practical work and make less empty 
promises." We must overcome bureaucracy and formalism, go deep 
into the grass-roots level, observe the conditions of the 
people, show concern for their sufferings, listen to their 
cries, and try in earnest to solve the practical problems, so as 
to put the party's basic purpose, fine workstyle, and mass line 
into the practical work we do. We must rely wholeheartedly on 
the working class and the masses of workers and earnestly 
strengthen the party's leadership toward the labor unions, the 
China Youth League, the women's federations, and other mass 
organizations. We must support their right to do their work 
independently according to their own charters and give full play 
to their roles as bridges and links. We should support and 
strengthen the blood ties between the party and the masses 
through various ways and means. 
  Since its founding, the Provincial Advisory Committee has 
upheld the party's basic line, wrapped itself around economic 
construction, launched in-depth investigations and studies, 
participated in discussions before important decisions are made, 
done extensive propaganda work on the party's general and 
specific policies, and has amplified our revolutionary 
tradition. It has performed outstanding work in helping the 
provincial party committee to strengthen party construction, 
maintain party unity and social stability, and promote reform 
and modernization. Politically and ideologically, it has always 
maintain unanimity with the party and given play to its role as 
the provincial party committee's political advisor and 
assistant. On behalf of the provincial party committee, I want 
to express our wholehearted gratitude and our highest respect to 
comrades in the Provincial Advisory Committee. In accordance 
with the gist of the 14th National Party Congress, we will no 
longer set up party advisory committees in the future. The 
provincial party committee and party committees at all levels 
must continue to learn from the veteran comrades' firm political 
stand, their spirit of seeking truth from facts, their lofty 
revolutionary sentiments, their fine traditional workstyle, and 
their rich work experience, and we must, as always, continue to 
respect them politically and show concern for their lives and to 
give play to their role in the construction of the socialist two 
civilizations. 
  Dear comrades, we are facing the greatest opportunity of our 
lifetime. History has bestowed upon us a glorious yet arduous 
mission, and even though we will encounter many problems and 
conflicts on the road ahead of us, there is much we can 
accomplish; our future is full of hope. Under the leadership of 
the Party Central Committee, with Comrade Zhang Zemin at the 
core, let us insist on embarking on the road to a socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, uphold the party's basic line, and rely 
entirely on the province's 43 million people. We must liberate 
our thinking, seek truth from facts, share one heart and mind, 
rouse ourselves for the sake of the country's prosperity, 
struggle arduously, do practical work, make new contributions to 
the total realization of Zhejiang's magnificent reform and 
development goals in the 1990's, and win new victories for 
Zhejiang's socialist modernization construction!

Propagandistic and Ideological Work Under the New 
Circumstances--Persist in Arming the People With Scientific 
Theory"] 
  [Text] The provincewide conference on propagandist and 
ideological work has just been concluded. According to the 
spirit of the All-China Conference on Propagandistic and 
Ideological Work, and with due integration with the actual 
conditions of Henan Province, we shall resoundingly proclaim the 
fundamental guiding principle which we shall adhere to in our 
propagandistic and ideological work: we shall raise high one 
main propaganda theme and energetically pursue five particular 
tasks. Comrade Deng Xiaoping set forth the theory of socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, a theory which is to serve as the 
fundamental directive for all work throughout the party. This 
fundamental directive must be firmly applied, in particular also 
to propagandistic and ideological work. Arming all party members 
and cadres with the weapon of this theory is primary task of the 
day, a task that must be carried out earnestly and effectively. 
  Deng Xiaoping's theory on the building socialism with 
Chinese 
characteristics profoundly reflects the objective law that 
governs China's socialist construction and succinctly manifests 
the will and desire of party and people. It is continuation and 
development of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is the Marxism of 
present-day China. The said theory is the spiritual mainstay for 
the entire party and for all nationalities throughout the 
country. It is the powerful ideological weapon that will win 
victory in reform, opening up, and modernization. During the 
past 15 years of reform and opening up, it is precisely under 
the guidance of this theory, that our undertaking of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics was seriously tested and 
vigorously developed within a most changeable international 
situation. China's economic construction, the people's living 
standards, and overall national strength have all reached a new 
and higher level of development, an achievement that has 
attracted worldwide attention. It is particularly under the 
guidance of the said theory that work in all the various sectors 
of Henan Province also resulted in huge achievements, that the 
economy could maintain its tendency of rapid growth, and that 
the strategic objective of "one high, one low" [yi gao, yi di] 
could have been achieved. Practical experience has made us 
deeply aware of the fact that whether or not we shall be able to 
arm all our party members, cadres, and the masses with Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics will have a direct effect on success or failure 
of our socialist modernizations, a direct effect on whether we 
shall be able to advance united, whether we shall be able to 
realize the objective of bringing prosperity to Henan Province, 
and whether we shall be able to implement the tasks set forth at 
the conference on propagandistic and ideological work. 
  The theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics 
is a complete scientific theoretical system, in which the 
various basic concepts and basic principles do not stand alone 
in isolation, but are inherently linked with one another. To 
truly grasp this theoretical system, to achieve mastery of it 
through comprehensive study, is not at all an easy matter. It 
requires attention to the complete and accurate understanding 
and mastery of the theoretical system within the overall body of 
the whole, as well as with respect to the mutual linkages of its 
parts. Particular attention and effort must be directed to the 
following three aspects: 
  1) Great efforts must be expended to attain the basic 
viewpoints expressed in the said theory concerning the 
important and fundamental theoretical problem of "what is 
socialism, how socialism is to be established and developed"; 2) 
An accurate understanding must be reached as to the inherent 
connections between the series of fundamental concepts in 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's writings; we must completely and 
accurately understand the fundamental line and theoretical basis 
of the principle "one central task, two basic points" [economic 
development plus a) adherence to the four cardinal principles 
and b) implementation of reform and the open policy; 3) We must 
firmly grasp the quintessence of "liberation of the mind" and of 
"seeking truth from facts," and must gain an understanding and 
mastery of the world view and methodology of dialectic 
materialism and historical materialism that permeates all of 
Comrade Deng's writings, while at the same time avoiding and 
reducing all subjectivism and metaphysics. 
  In the study of scientific theory, emphasis must be on its 
ultimate linkage with the realities and on the guidance it 
provides for action. Comrade Jiang Zemin recently emphasized the 
need for a thorough study of Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, the need to closely link such 
studies with the overall situation in the work of the entire 
party during this year, and the need to raise the level of 
political consciousness as to all action within the present 
overall situation. The Central Committee has decided on the 
following to be this year's overall tasks for the entire party: 
to seize the favorable opportunity to deepen the reform, expand 
opening up, promote economic development, and to preserve 
stability. In matters of establishing the socialist market 
economy system, China has this year accomplished many important 
reform measures, actions which may be compared to "storming 
heavily fortified positions." To gain victory in a fight of this 
nature requires a particularly strong measure of close unity 
among the broad masses of party members, cadres, and the people, 
also concerted action of all concerned, breaking new paths, and 
vigorous advances ahead. Through the study of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's writings, we shall attain a better unity of thinking 
with regard to the overall state of the work performed by the 
entire party, a unity of thinking also with regard to all 
important policy decisions of the party and the state on 
improving reform. When linking up with the realities, we must 
also link up closely with the particular realities of Henan 
Province in its reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping, for instance, has repeatedly emphasized 
seizing favorable opportunities to accelerate economic 
development, and has questioned why some regions have always 
been slow in their development. There may be many reasons for 
it, but the main reasons, we are afraid, are that they have not 
truly effected "liberation of minds" and have not 
conscientiously "sought truth from facts." You, who are in 
leading positions, have not yet changed your ways of thinking. 
You have not yet replaced those old "leftist" things and those 
traditional concepts, formed under the conditions of the planned 
economy, by the new ideas and new concepts suited to the 
socialist market economy. You have not yet become fully 
conscious of reform and opening up, of market economy, and of 
the spirit of arduous pioneering work. How, then, can you expect 
that your districts can spread the wings that would lift them 
up? If you who are in leading positions will not do a solid job, 
if you are afraid that your actions may result in "political 
merits," and if you, in the end, go in for formalism, put on 
false airs, even go so far as to resort to deception, deceive 
those above and bully those below, is that not running in the 
opposite direction to "seeking truth from facts"? Through the 
study of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, all regions and all agencies are to find out 
the strong points and deficiencies of their regions and units, 
should reason out their developmental paths, and should 
determine their particular development plans according to actual 
conditions, seize favorable opportunities, and accelerate 
economic development. There a common saying: If the cadre does 
not lead, the water buffalo will fall into the well. It is the 
same with theoretical studies. Leading cadres at all levels, 
especially those of department [chu] and higher rank in the 
counties, must set an example, take the lead in studying and 
applying, and by their own model actions motivate and influence 
all party members and cadres toward studies. At the same time, 
they should start out from the realities of their district or 
unit, meticulously arrange and well organize -- in a planned 
way, with points of emphasis, and level by level -- the study of 
all their many party members and cadres. Best material for the 
study of the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics is 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. It 
is now a necessity to effectively organize the study of Volume 3 
of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. This should 
be combined with the study of the documents from the 14th NPC 
and the decisions of the Third Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, as well as a thorough study of the theory and basics 
of the socialist market economy. These studies should furnish 
full knowledge of the necessity, urgency, and arduous nature of 
establishing this new economic system, should strengthen 
political consciousness as regards the reform, and this should 
ensure, through concerted effort by high and low throughout the 
entire province, the ultimate success in the reform, a victory 
in what appears like "storming of a heavily fortified position."

Propagandistic and Ideological Work Under the New 
Circumstances--Ensuring Correct Guidance of Public Opinion"] 
  [Text] At the All-China Conference on Propagandistic and 
Ideological Work, general-secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out that 
it is necessary to guide the people by means of correct public 
opinion media. This is a most important task to be achieved at 
the propaganda and ideology front. 
  The effects of accurate guidance of public opinion are huge. 
Accurate guidance of public opinion will consolidate popular 
feelings and enhance popular spirit. Faulty guidance of public 
opinion will result in slackening of morale, which will have 
serious consequences. Historical experiences tell us that it has 
never been possible to achieve glorious victories, be it in 
revolution or in construction, without accurate guidance of 
public opinion. During the past 15 years of reform and opening 
up, accurate guidance of public opinion has been extremely 
effective. It has been effective in the "liberation of minds," 
in renovating concepts, in unifying thought and action of the 
entire party and of all people throughout the nation, in 
preserving a secure and united social and political situation, 
in arousing and manifesting the enthusiasm, initiative, and 
creativity of the masses, and in promoting the smooth progress 
of reform, of opening up, and of all modernization projects. The 
exemplary strength displayed by Jiao Yulu [3542 5940 4389], when 
secretary of the county party committee, is up to this day an 
inspiration for all the many cadres and for the masses. The 
pioneering spirit of the people of Linxian County has the effect 
of a huge motivating force for all the people of the province to 
work hard toward bringing prosperity to Henan Province. The 
great "liberation of the mind" discussion, that has been 
organized these last one, two years, has promoted a renovation 
of concepts among all cadres and the masses throughout the 
province. The systematic reportage on "The Upsurge of Reform in 
the Mid-China Plains" strengthened the confidence of all the 
people throughout the province in deepening the reform and in 
promoting economic development. The heroic feats of Xu Honggang 
[1776 3163 0474] and Zhang Huanli [1728 3883 4409], their 
readiness to fight for a just cause, is just now encouraging 
millions of young men and women of the central plain to fight 
courageously against evil and wickedness and to promote and 
develop a healthy atmosphere. The many advanced models that have 
emerged on all our battle fronts have already become examples to 
be emulated by all the people of the entire province... We must 
review the experiences in these various quarters and draw 
lessons from them, in order to enhance the effectiveness of our 
guidance of public opinion. 
  Correct guidance of public opinion requires of us that we 
firmly persist in preserving unity and stability, that we evoke 
enthusiasm, that we pursue a policy of positive propaganda, and 
that we give prominence to the main theme of reform, opening up, 
and economic development. We must propagate most thoroughly the 
spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, of the Third Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and of the Eighth Session of 
the Fifth Provincial Party Congress, namely to maintain 
continuity and stability in our basic propagandistic themes. We 
must comprehensively and correctly propagate the political line, 
principles, and policies of the party. We must persist in 
dialectical materialism and avoid one-sidedness, and we must 
also observe propagandistic discipline. We must profusely 
propagate the achievements of reform and opening up, and must 
concentrate attention on economic construction as focal point 
and main battle ground. We must effectively deal with the 
various relationships. We must accurately guide, effectively 
protect, and effectively bring into play the enthusiasm of the 
masses and of every sector of society. We must encourage and 
stimulate the unswerving confidence of the masses, and have them 
energetically forge ahead as of one heart and one mind, while 
taking the interests of the whole into consideration, in order 
to have the various reform plans smoothly presented and 
implemented and creating an excellent social environment in the 
area of public opinion. We must predominantly propagate those 
positive ideas and actions that will encourage, inspire, and 
enlighten the people as to the struggle for the purpose of 
achieving a prosperous and strong state, the welfare of the 
people, and an advanced society. We must regularly and without 
respite propagate various advanced exemplary cases of topical 
characteristics, review and disseminate the advanced experiences 
created by cadres and masses in every locality, and have their 
advanced ideas and experiences become the common wealth shared 
by the entire province. 
  Correct guidance of public opinion requires more propaganda 
among the masses. We must enthusiastically propagate advanced 
personalities as such are found among workers, peasants, 
intellectuals, and soldiers, who at their ordinary posts show 
unselfish dedication. We must more effectively guide the 
enthusiasm and creativity of the masses toward the grand 
undertaking of our modernization projects. We must create 
throughout the entire society an excellent custom of striving 
for healthy progress and active forging-ahead. In the opposite 
case, if we were to pander to the tastes of some people and 
unrestrainedly publicize the stars, people of financial 
prominence, and the abnormal consumption of those who spend 
money like water, our guidance would be misdirected, would lead 
to a slackening of morale, and to a collapse of fighting spirit. 
  This year is extremely critical for the deepening of reform 
and for progress in economic development, a year in which a 
series of new important reform measures will continuously be 
initiated, and in which, as a consequence, some new 
contradictions and new problems will prop up. This will require 
of all who are engaged in propagandistic and ideological work to 
familiarize themselves well with the overall situation, to 
effectively handle, in the course of ongoing work, the 
relationship between reform, economic development, and social 
stability. It requires close coordination with the general and 
particular policies of the party, deep penetration of the basic 
levels, and strengthening of investigation and research in 
public sentiment and in the mentality of the masses. It requires 
fullest propagation of the enormous achievements of reform and 
opening up during the past 15 years, and active propaganda of 
the excellent state of reform, opening up, and economic 
development, informing of good examples and good experiences in 
all reform measures seen in actual practice. It requires opening 
up ideological channels deep into sentiments and reasoning, with 
convincing arguments and in forms that are appreciated by the 
masses, concerning those problems that impact social stability, 
it requires resolving contradictions, straightening out moods 
and sentiments, and converting negative into positive factors. 
  Correct guidance of public opinion also requires effective 
supervision of public opinion. Through supervision of public 
opinion we shall be able to oppose bureaucratism, to rectify 
unhealthy tendencies, to overcome various negative and decadent 
phenomena, and to strengthen the people's confidence in 
progress. Supervision of public opinion must pay attention to 
commending the good and to criticizing all shortcomings. It must 
appropriately deal with disturbing elements, it must support 
whoever favors reform, it must encourage exploratory activities, 
must educate those that have gone astray, must penalize the 
corrupt, and must prosecute those who lodge false accusations. 
In short, supervision of public opinion must definitely overcome 
the tendency to merely and purely strive for "sensational 
effects." Our attention must be directed toward achieving 
beneficial social results. We must firmly adhere to the 
principle of seeking truth from facts in order to create a great 
environment in which solid work will be performed and new 
achievements will be attained.

<F P=106> [Article by own commentator: "(3) On Strengthening </F>
Propagandistic and Ideological Work Under the New 
Circumstances--Efforts To Shape and Bring Up a New Generation"] 
  [Text] China is in the process of entering a new historical 
era. Strengthening ideological work, nurturing and raising a new 
generation, fighting for the realization of the socialist 
modernization projects, these are arduous, but also glorious and 
important tasks to be accomplished at the propaganda and 
ideology front. 
  Since last year, we have seen some exemplary personalities 
emerge in Henan Province, such as Zhang Huanli [1728 3883 4409], 
Xu Honggang [1776 3163 0474], and Yao Cihui [1202 2945 2585]. 
Their shining achievements of unselfishness, their energetic 
pursuit of progress, and their ideological brilliance in 
arduously pioneering new undertakings reflect the main theme in 
the spirit of our time. In their unselfish contributions toward 
the prosperity of the country, in their efforts to restore and 
support an atmosphere of morality, in risking their lives for 
the just cause, they are the backbone of our nation and models 
for human conduct. All the people of China's central plain are 
proud of them. Emergency of such personalities is inseparably 
linked to their being nurtured by the party and nourished by the 
people. Essentially, this is indeed the strategy of "grasping 
with both hands [simultaneous pursuit of two tactics]" that has 
been unswervingly implemented by the party committees at all 
levels throughout Henan Province since the 14th CPC National 
Congress, as it is also the rich fruit, brought to fruition in 
intensified ideological-political work. It also tells us that 
ideological-political work in the new historical era is still a 
mighty force. As long as it is conducted in all earnest, it will 
certainly bring good results. 
  Adhering to the party's basic line, building up a strong, 
modern socialist country, translating into reality the guiding 
ideology set forth by the provincial party committee, namely of 
"uniting in vigorous advance, bringing prosperity to Henan 
Province," and realizing its strategic objective of "one high, 
one low," entails as the one most pressing problem the need to 
raise talents in the next generation. The more exemplary 
personalities, such as Zhang Huanli, Xu Honggang, and Yao Cihui, 
will emerge, the more cohesive will our society be, and the 
better shall we be able to inspire a larger number of people to 
unselfishly contribute to our cause. Strengthening ideological 
work and nurturing and shaping the new socialist generation, is 
an urgent demand that evolves from the general tasks of the 
party in the new era, as it is also a project of vital 
importance for generations to come. Whoever truly hopes for the 
accomplishment of the four modernization projects must devote 
all his energy to the nurturing of talents in the next 
generation. Whoever is sincerely concerned about the fate of 
state and nation, must double his or her efforts in 
ideological-political work, to ensure and promote the healthy 
upbringing of the new generation. 
  Of foremost importance in intensified ideological work is 
instilling a lofty spirit in people. The lofty spirit mentioned 
here is the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, as 
Comrade Mao Zedong had advocated long ago. It is the spirit of 
"having ideals, a moral conscience, culture, and discipline," as 
repeatedly emphasized by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. It is also the 
64-word pioneering spirit in Comrade Jiang Zemin's summing up of 
the new era. It manifests the excellent work style of the 
communist person, as it also is indeed the traditional morality 
of the Chinese nation, passed on through generations. It is 
coalescence of valuable experiences gathered by our party in the 
protracted struggle of the past, as it has also fresh 
characteristics of our new era. It is a powerful spiritual 
pillar in the construction of socialism with Chinese 
characeristics. One fundamental task of ideological work is to 
show itself capable of applying this kind of a spirit in the 
shaping of the new generation, in spurring them on to exert 
themselves and fight for the basic interests of the Chinese 
nation, and to make unselfish contributions. 
  In strengthening ideological work, attention must be paid to 
its goal-oriented nature. In the last few years, there has been 
some relaxation in ideological work, and some curtailing of such 
work, in some places and agencies. Money worship, hedonism, and 
extreme subjectivism have grown up and spread, and have 
seriously polluted the people's mentality. To cope with this 
situation it is necessary to launch ideological-moral education 
among the masses, especially among the youths, an education in 
which patriotism, collectivism, and socialism are core content, 
to launch an education of arduous struggle and of building up 
the country through hard work and thrift, an education of 
professional ethics, of social morality, and education in the 
fundamentals of the national condition, also education in the 
rule of law. In all these areas, particular emphasis should be 
placed on the concepts of ideal and belief. Realizing the four 
modernization projects is the common ideal and common belief of 
all nationalities of the Chinese nation at the present stage. 
Whether there exist this ideal and this belief, whether this 
ideal and this belief have been unshakably established, is not 
only decisive for the work and life attitude of the individual 
concerned, but also for his capability of deciding between good 
and evil. In his statement on the "four necessary qualities," 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping places ideal at the top. It is absolutely 
necessary for us to guide the people, especially our youths, 
toward the formation of correct ideals, beliefs, world outlook, 
outlook on life, and value concepts, and to have them oppose and 
reject the intrusion of every kind of decadent and degenerate 
ideology. 
  Most important task in the strengthening of ideological work 
is the education of our youths. Focal point in nurturing the new 
socialist person, whether viewed in its immediate aspect or in 
its more remote impact, is the education of our youths. We must 
pay attention to the particular characteristics of youth, 
differentiate between different targets, and adopt diverse 
methods. We must be apt at opening up channels, pay attention to 
the development of democracy, respect the human individual, 
understand the human individual, show concern for and provide 
encouragement for the human individual. We must adopt a method 
of attracting widest participation by the masses, a method of 
having the masses themselves teach themselves, the method of 
discussions in complete equality, the method of criticism and 
self-criticism. We must educate and help our youths toward 
gaining a lofty spirit, so that they may become reliable 
successors in the cause of socialist modernization. 
  Strengthening ideological work is a matter for the entire 
party to be concerned with. It is not to be merely undertaken at 
the propaganda and ideological front, but is to be undertaken by 
the party committees at all levels and by the basic party 
organizations in enterprises and industrial units, in the 
villages, schools, and neighborhoods. The various administrative 
agencies, as well as labor unions, All-China Women's Federation, 
and the Communist Youth League also bear heavy responsibility in 
this respect. All discipline and law enforcement agencies are 
certainly also not excluded here. We all must jointly shoulder 
the heavy historical task and exert ourselves in the struggle 
effort of nurturing the next and every succeeding generation of 
socialist new persons who shall possess ideals, morality, 
culture, and discipline.

<F P=106> ["Statistical Report on Economic and Social Developments in </F>
1993 Issued by Xinjiang-Uygur Autonomous Region's Bureau of 
Statistics," dated 15 Feb 94] 
  [Text] In 1993, people of all nationalities in Xinjiang, 
led by the Autonomous Region Party Committee and People's 
Government, following the spirit of the Third Plenum of the 14th 
CPC National Congress and guidelines of the Party Central 
Government and State Council to strengthen macroeconomic 
regulation and control, conquered the difficulties encountered 
in our forward march, stepped up the pace of reform and opening 
up, and made considerable progress in various areas such as 
economic construction and social development. Based on 
preliminary calculations, the region's total production value in 
1993 was 49.796 billion yuan, up 9.5 percent over the previous 
year; of which, 15.282 billion yuan represented increased 
production value of tertiary industry, an increase of 12.3 
percent and accounting for 30.7 percent of the region's total 
production value. The major remaining problems in the economy 
are low returns in industrial production, inadequate reserve 
strength in agricultural production, serious shortage of 
capital, persistently high commodity prices, increasing 
difficulties in finance, and continuing serious bottlenecks in 
rail transportation and communications. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  Agricultural production continued to develop. In 1993, the 
region's agriculture began developing in the direction of the 
market economy; understanding of the concept on the part of 
peasants increased; high-yield, high-quality and high-efficiency 
agriculture made its appearance; and agricultural production 
conditions and the external environment improved. The region did 
away with central planning in agriculture, and based on the 
premise of guaranteeing overall grain production, made 
appropriate reductions in grain acreage and increased the area 
for growing cash crops. Total production of grain and cotton hit 
historically high levels; productions in agriculture, forestry, 
animal husbandry and fishery all improved over the previous 
year; with more rapid development in rural enterprises, the 
rural economy showed an accelerating growth trend. Total 
agricultural production value in 1993 was 18.753 billion yuan 
(18.491 billion yuan at 1990 constant prices), up 4.4 percent 
over the previous year; of which, the total production value of 
farming was 14.138 billion yuan, up 3.9 percent; forestry, 456 
million yuan, up 10 percent; animal husbandry, 4.036 billion 
yuan, up 5.4 percent; and fishery, 123 million yuan, up 3.9 
percent. In 1993, increased value in agricultural production was 
13.144 billion yuan, representing 26.6 percent of China's total 
production value and an increase of 4.5 percent over the year 
before. 
  The total value of non-farm productions such as rural 
industries, construction, transportation and commerce was 4.495 
billion yuan, representing 19.3 percent of the rural economy in 
1993, up from 18.2 percent of the year before. 
  Gross receipts of rural enterprises in the region totalled 
6.492 billion yuan in 1993, up 57.3 percent over the previous 
year; their total production value was 6.209 billion yuan, up 
42.4 percent. 
  Among agricultural products with significant production 
quantities, except for beet which showed some decline, all other 
main crops showed increases in various degrees.

  Forestry products and reforestation work made new progress. 
In 1993, the region's reforestation area totalled 56,500 
hectares, up 27.3 percent, and the "Three North" protective 
forestation system built around protective forestation of 
farmland achieved new results, and the region's reforestation 
rate continued to rise. 
  Animal husbandry production increased overall, and the main 
animal products, quantities and numerical herd sizes are as 
follows:

  Fishery production reached a new high. Aquatic products 
totalled 28,800 tons in 1993, up 8.4 percent over the previous 
year. 
  Agricultural production conditions were further improved. At 
1993 year-end, the region's total agricultural mechanization 
power was 6,081,900 kilowatt, up 2.4 percent over the previous 
year-end; large and medium-size tractors in use totalled 50,000, 
maintaining the same level as the year before; total chemical 
fertilizer application (adjusted for purity) was 503,200 tons, 
down 4.0 percent; rural electricity consumption was 1.377 
billion kilowatt-hour, up 5.5 percent; effectively irrigated 
area was 2.81 million hectares, up 0.3 percent. 
  Major remaining problems in agricultural development are: 
relative decline in agricultural input and inadequate follow-up 
to development; rapid price increase of production materials for 
agriculture, adding to the peasant burdens; sluggish growth in 
secondary and tertiary industries in rural areas, and peasants 
income not increasing despite increased production; inadequate 
circulation and sales of agricultural products requiring help to 
strengthen the foundation of agriculture. 
<H5>  II. Manufacturing and Construction Industries </H5>
  In 1993, all industrial departments in the region speeded up 
reforms in various areas and industrial production grew in 
moderate degree. The region's total industrial production value 
was 44.811 billion yuan (32.521 billion yuan in terms of 1990 
constant prices), up 10.9 percent over the previous year. The 
increased value in industries was 15.314 billion yuan, an 
increase of 10.7 percent. 
  As for the total industrial production values of industries 
by category above the village level: that of the state-owned 
industries was 35.464 billion yuan, up 7.2 percent; 
collective-owned industries, 7.125 billion yuan, up 16.3 
percent; other type of industries, 659 million yuan, up 52.5 
percent. Production value of heavy industries was 27.027 billion 
yuan, up 11.2 percent; that of light industries was 16.221 
billion yuan, up 7.9 percent. 
  Production to sales cycle of industrial products was quite 
satisfactory. Total sales of industrial products at above the 
village level came to 41.927 billion yuan, with 96.7 percent of 
the heavy industry products and 97.3 percent of the light 
industry products produced sold. 
  Vitality of large and medium-size enterprises was 
strengthened. The 165 such enterprises in the region generated 
industrial production value totalling 22.843 billion yuan, 
accounting for 51 percent of the region's total production value. 
  Definite progress was made in adjusting the industrial 
product structure. Compared with the prior year's 100 main 
product categories, 54 categories showed growth. Among heavy 
industry products, stimulated by increased investment needs, 
growths of considerable margin were seen in crude oil, oil 
refinery capacity, electricity generation capacity, iron ores, 
pig iron, roll steel, bauxite, ferro-alloy, cement, industrial 
mica, and outer tires. Light industry products which did not 
sell well included bicycles, color television, gauze cloth, 
rugs, leather shoes, crude salt, daily use pottery ware, daily 
use glass ware, chemical detergent, plastic products all of 
which showed various degrees of sale decline. Contradictions of 
product structure not compatible with market needs and demands 
were especially salient. 
  Production quantities of major industrial products are as 
follows:

  The 1993 consolidated industrial economic benefits index, 
independently calculated, was 70.2 percent, down from 78.6 
percent of the previous year. In the index, industrial product 
sales increased to 96.9 from 94.8 percent; the return on capital 
rate was -3.9 percent, down from the former 2.7 percent. The 
overall economic benefits was even lower, given the lack of 
sufficient capital, accumulating "triangular debts," over 
reliance on the three categories of capital, and widening losses 
of state-owned enterprises. 
  Construction enterprises developed rapidly. In 1993, with 
continuing increase in fixed asset investments, intensifying 
reforms of construction industries and effects of market 
mechanism being felt, the production rate of construction 
industries, especially those owned by state, increased rapidly 
and showed increased vitality. The 1993 total production value 
reached 5.775 billion yuan, up 48.4 percent, and the quality of 
construction also improved. 
  Geological exploration led to new finds. Geological 
explorations in the region led to a series of new discoveries in 
1993, with 10 locations determined to be important mining sites, 
six sites of metals, two of nonferrous materials, and two of 
underground water; increased efforts were made to develop two 
mines, one copper, the other gold. Four sites were located where 
the types and extent of mineral deposits remained to be 
determined. 
<H5>  III. Fixed Asset Investment </H5>
  In 1993, the Government continued to increase fixed asset 
investments in Xinjiang to speed development and construction of 
infrastructure facilities such as energy, transportation and 
communications. In 1993, fixed asset investments totalled 23.195 
billion yuan, up 36.4 percent over the previous year; of which, 
local project investments totalled 7.385 billion yuan, up 30.9 
percent. Investments by state-owned units totalled 20.875 
billion yuan, up 36.8 percent; investments by collective units 
came to 1.028 billion yuan, up 61.4 percent; investments by 
individuals in cities and townships totalled 1.292 billion yuan, 
up 17 percent. Among investments by state-owned units, 13.652 
billion yuan were in basic constructions, up 29.4 percent over 
the year before; 4.125 billion yuan for restructuring and 
renewal of enterprises, up 89.3 percent; 475 million yuan for 
constructing commercial buildings, up 98.7 percent; 2.623 
billion yuan for other areas, up 14.2 percent. 
  The composition of investments was further adjusted. In 
1993, 
the region continued to increase investment in infrastructural 
facilities and key projects in transportation, transport and 
communications, and energy. A total of 986 million yuan was 
invested in transportation and communications, up 55.3 percent; 
797 million yuan and 5.591 billion yuan were invested in 
electricity and petroleum development, up 48.1 percent and 6.3 
percent respectively. 
  Progress in developing the region's 35 key engineering 
projects was good. Of the year's total investment of 10.179 
billion yuan, funds that went to planned projects and particular 
engineering phases achieved rather good results. Building the 
sulfuric acid facilities at the Urumqi Sulfuric Acid Plant led 
to successful test production, and the project's first phase 
began production while construction of the second phase got 
underway; at the Xinjiang Salt Purifying Plant, the first test 
production was successfully conducted, ahead of plan by more 
than four months; at Dushan, important facilities for ethylene 
and butadiene production were installed, and a series of 
processing productions started; for expansion of No. 8 Steel 
Works, 307 million yuan was invested; 980 million yuan was 
invested to expand the Lan[zhou]- Xin[jiang] railway, with 475.5 
kilometers of tracks laid in the main trunk line, and work for 
the entire project speeded up; the entire Beitun-Dahuangshan 
national highway No. 216 was open to traffic; and construction 
work is proceeding steadily on three key ports at Huoer Guoshi, 
Bagutu and Yierkesitan; and work in a number of other key 
engineering projects was pushed ahead. 
<H5>  IV. Transportation, Postal and Telecommunications </H5>
  In 1993, transportation, transport, postal and 
telecommunications continued to develop. Branching out from main 
rail lines resulted in reaching the transport volume of 317,200 
tons. The railway department continued to build according to the 
overall rail transportation plan and to ensure that important 
materials were transported. The status of the various forms of 
transport and their capacities is shown below:

  Contradictions of transportation and transport not 
coordinated with economic and societal developmental needs are 
very obvious, and rail transportation was especially critical, 
with state-run transport and transportation enterprises facing 
considerable difficulties. 
  Postal and telecommunications developed rapidly. In 1993, 
the 
total investment in the postal and telecommunications field was 
397 million yuan, up 37.9 percent over the previous year; 
special delivery expanded by 34.6 percent, radio paging service 
expanded 1.5-fold, and number of cellular telephones increased 
more than 500-fold. Long distance and municipal telephone 
systems developed rapidly; 16 cities and towns are now covered 
by the long distance telecommunications net, and municipal 
switchboards expanded to 167,000 switches, an almost three-fold 
increase over the previous year. 
  Although postal and telecommunications developed rather 
rapidly, the contradiction of lack of coordination with economic 
development of the autonomous region are very salient. 
<H5>  V. Domestic Commerce and Market Prices </H5>
  In 1993 with intensified reforms in numerous aspects and 
areas in the region, urban and rural markets were active, goods 
of all varieties were traded and both buying and selling 
flourished; retail sales totalled 18.465 billion yuan, up 17.15 
percent (after adjusting for the price factor, an increase of 4 
percent in real terms). Retail sales of consumer goods totalled 
16.71 billion yuan, up 20.9 percent; those of agricultural 
production materials totalled 1.755 billion yuan, down 9.4 
percent. Breaking down the total consumer goods retail sales, 
cities and townships accounted for 13.306 billion yuan, up 21.9 
percent from the previous year; rural areas for 3.404 billion 
yuan, up 20 percent. Retail sales to individuals totalled 14.401 
billion yuan, up 18.8 percent; to collectives, 2.309 billion 
yuan, up 35.8 percent. 
  Differentiating consumers retail sales by type of economic 
entity: state-owned units accounted for 9.783 billion yuan, up 
12.1 percent; collective-owned units for 3.44 billion yuan, down 
0.4 percent; and individually owned units for 3.586 billion 
yuan, up 50.8 percent. Retail sales to non-agricultural 
residents by peasants totalled 1.606 billion yuan, up 33.1 
percent. Differentiating retail sales by type of consumer good: 
edibles and foodstuff increased by 3.14 percent and edible oils 
by one-fold. Among durable consumer goods, except for black and 
white TV and audio recorder, washing machine, refrigerator and 
color TV showed different degrees of increase. Consumption 
pattern of urban residents showed changes, with telephone, home 
remodelling and high-grade furniture purchase gradually becoming 
hot consumption areas. 
  Both sales and purchases of production materials flourished. 
In 1993, suppliers purchased such materials paying a total of 
7.229 billion yuan, up 14.8 percent over the previous year; they 
sold the materials for a total of 7.55 billion yuan, up 10.7 
percent. 
  Price reform made substantial progress. The government freed 
prices of iron and steel in stages, controlled only part of the 
sale prices of coal and charcoal, and completely freed prices of 
cement; the autonomous region reformed the circulation system of 
grain and edible oil by completely freeing their sale prices and 
adjusting the fees resident paid for services. The Government 
also relaxed managerial control over prices of consumer products 
in the market, and up to 93 percent of the prices were 
determined by the market. In 1993, the overall price level of 
consumer goods rose by 12.6 percent over the year before.

<H5>  VI. External Economic Activities </H5>
  In 1993, the region's external economic activities achieved 
new results; barter trade developed rapidly and became a major 
pillar of the region's external trade. Total value of exports 
and imports reached $912 million, up 30.3 percent over the 
previous year. The total value of exports was $495 million, up 
22.8 percent. The total value of barter imports and exports was 
$577 million, up 80.2 percent over the previous year, accounting 
for 63.3 percent of all imports and exports. The total value of 
barter exports was $289 million, up 75.5 percent, accounting for 
58.4 percent of all exports. 
  The 1993 Urumqi and Border Areas Economic and Trade Talks 
Conference was successfully held, drawing out-of-region 
attention while focusing interests within the region, and 
achieved bountiful results. The talks resulted in trade deals 
totalling $2.003 billion, $137 million more than the total of 
the 1992 Urumqi Trade Conference. Export deals totalled $631 
million, import deals $510 million, and external economic 
projects $860 million. A total of 689 contracts for intra-region 
trade and cooperative projects and a total of 211 trade 
agreements, valued at 3.165 billion yuan, were signed. 
  Utilization of foreign capital grew by a large margin. A 
total of 363 investment contracts with foreign businessmen were 
signed, totalling $257 million, with $53 million of actual 
investments, representing 1.9-fold and 4.2-fold increases 
respectively over the previous year, and the largest number of 
such contracts in recent years. The number of "foreign funded" 
enterprises increased sharply, with 508 such enterprises 
registered by the end of 1993, a 2.1-fold increase over the end 
of 1992. 
  The area of economic and technical cooperation with external 
entities continued to expand. A total of 241 external economic 
and technical cooperation projects were approved in 1993, up 
28.2 percent over the previous year. The projects totalled $66 
million, down 47.2 percent from the previous year. 
  International tourism continued to develop. In 1993, 241,000 
tourists visited the region, up 0.7 percent over the previous 
year. Foreign exchange earnings from tourism totalled $40 
million, up 12.6 percent. The number of buyer-tourists totalled 
126,000 persons, down 5.3 percent, accounting for 52.3 percent 
of all tourists. 
  Economic and technical agreements broke new ground. The 1993 
signed agreements covered 1,500 projects (up 11.4 percent), 
valued at 2.826 billion yuan (down 13.6 percent), of which 566 
million yuan represented investments by other provinces (up 
3-fold). 
<H5>  VII. Science, Education, Culture and Health, Sports </H5>
  Science and technology activities flourished. In 1993, the 
region accomplished 330 important S&amp;T projects at the region 
level or above, of which four projects received national-level 
S&amp;T progress awards, and two national satellite research 
awards. 
In 1993, 642 applications were submitted for copyright technical 
explorations, 454 applications for proprietary benefits, up 28 
percent and 1.3-fold respectively over the previous year. 
  Scientific and technological cadres grew in number and 
quality. By the end of 1993, some 420,000 technical personnel 
were attached to various enterprise units. In the region, there 
were a total of 136 state-run research and development units at

total value of 113 million yuan, up 1.98 percent and one-fold 
respectively over the previous year. 
  Satellite plans yielded notable results. By year-end 1993, a 
total of 139 planned satellite projects were implemented, with 
260 million yuan of investment. Of this amount, 150 million yuan 
were bank loans, 100 million yuan were the region's own 
investment or other inputs, and the projected payoff was valued 
at 680 million yuan, with 150 million yuan in profit. The region 
invested close to 200,000 yuan for satellite training of various 
types of personnel numbering 40,000 from the agricultural and 
animal husbandry fields. In 1993, the region participated in the 
All-China Trade Conference and Exhibit of Satellite Results at 
Changde, and 15 projects received the conference gold medals, 
two projects the silver medals; the region was also given the 
best delegation award and the Northwest five-provinces award for 
signing the largest amount of contracts. 
  Educational activities made new progress. A total of 142 new 
graduate students enrolled in 1993, along with 346 graduate 
students already in training, up from 49 and 89 persons 
respectively over the previous year. A total of 13,200 students 
enrolled in the basic and specialized science programs at the

studies, the per capita urban resident income for living 
expenses was 2,215.32 yuan in 1993, up 26.4 percent over the 
previous year, but after adjusting for the price factor, an 
increase of 11.2 percent in real terms. The per capita rural 
resident income was 778 yuan, up 5 percent. 
  Urban labor work force continued to increase in number. In 
1993, the number of employment offices at various levels grew to 
320, which succeeded in placing 111,300 persons in employment in 
cities and townships; at year-end, 3.6 percent of urban 
residents were wait listed for employment. By the end of 1993, a 
total of 3.792 million persons were employed, up 120,000 over

salaries and wages in 1993 were 10.89 billion yuan, up 27.2 
percent over the previous year; the average cash wages was 3,415 
yuan, up 24.5 percent, but adjusted for the price factor, a real 
increase of 10.2 percent. 
  Urban and rural savings grew. By 1993 year-end, savings of 
urban and rural residents totalled 24.412 billion yuan, an 
increase of 5.032 billion yuan or up 26 percent over the year 
before. 
  Insurance businesses made rather good progress. The total 
value of insurance for various types of assets was 48.234 
billion yuan in 1993, up 35.5 percent over the year before, with 
7,476 enterprises in the region taking out insurance on the 
enterprise properties, 852,100 households on family assets, and 
1,780,400 individuals on life policies. Insurance companies 
handled 71,974 property loss cases, paying out 147,793,000 yuan 
of claims, and settled life insurance claims of 16,584 
individual policy-holders totalling 14,302,000 yuan. 
  Social welfare activities were further improved. In 1993, 
the 
region's various social welfare organizations had a total of 
6,661 bed spaces and were taking care of 5,494 persons. A total 
of 19,763 persons who were orphaned, handicapped, aged and 
living alone received collective provided care. A total of 
273,700 persons requiring various social welfare services in 
urban and rural areas were given assistance by the government, 
and 163 townships set up social safety net in rural areas and 
established 704 sites for providing various social services. 
  Environment protection activities were strengthened. In 1993 
the region's environmental protection system had 1,194 employees 
and operated, at various levels, 40 environmental inspection 
stations, three state-sponsored nature protection zones, and six 
region-sponsored nature protection zones; the region carried out 
45 projects involving investment of 21,740,000 yuan to rectify 
environmental pollution within a specified period. By year-end, 
11 cities in the region had completed 66 smoke and dirt control 
zones covering 166.34 square kilometers; eight cities had 
established 22 noise pollution control zones covering 101.09 
square kilometers. 
<H5>  IX. Troops Supporting Production and Construction </H5>
  Support to social welfare and national economy by military 
units continued to develop steadily. Their total production 
value in 1993 was 6.65 billion yuan, up 9.5 percent over the 
previous year. 
  With further adjustment made in the agricultural production 
structure, and its basic foundation strengthened, agricultural 
production achieved rather good results. The total agricultural 
production value was 4.5 billion yuan (4.36 billion yuan in 
terms of 1990 constant prices), an increase of 2.3 percent over 
the previous year; grain production was 1.4 million tons, down 
3.8 percent; cotton, 250,000 tons, up 5.9 percent; edible oils,

with a total production value of 700 million yuan, up 80.4 
percent over the previous year; and total receipts of 680 
million yuan, up 78.9 percent. 
  Growth of industrial production was maintained, and 
conditions of both production and sales appeared favorable. The 
total industrial production value was 7 billion yuan (6.2 
billion yuan in terms of 1990 constant prices), up 8.6 percent 
over the previous year; with production of heavy industries down 
12.5 percent, light industries up 13.7 percent, the 
production-to-sale ratio reached 99 percent. Among the main

  The market of consumer products developed steadily. The 
total 
commercial retail sales reached 3 billion yuan, up 16.1 percent 
over the year before. 
  Foreign trade can make the best use of groups, the region's 
resources and enterprise advantages, and help develop internal 
and foreign markets; the region's imports and exports totalled 
$140 million, up 91.5 percent over the year before. 
  Culture, education, science and technology, public health, 
family planning, environmental protection, sports and so on all 
achieved new records through reforms and development, and 
contributed their shares to make the Xinjiang economy prosperous.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhang Yulai [1728 3768 0171]: ``CAS Machine </F>
Translation Center Completes Construction of Three Bases''] 
  [Summary] Beijing, 4 Apr -- It has been learned from the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) that since world-renowned 
young machine translation scholar Dr. Chen Zhaoxiong began to 
direct the CAS Computer Institute's Machine Translation Center 
(MTC) in November 1992, CAS has completed construction of two 
other MTCs. The three domestic centers now specialize in the 
following areas: research in information science, production and 
development of machine translation systems (MTSs), and technical 
training, respectively. 
  The two new centers have already taken on over 10 research 
projects including State 863 Program key tasks, NSFC key tasks, 
and international and domestic cooperative projects. The 
centers have admitted into their facilities over 100 invited 
guests and cooperative research fellows from Beijing University, 
Qinghua University, and 16 other higher-learning institutions 
and research institutes. With 863 Program support, Dr. Chen and 
his colleagues have developed a number of MTSs including 
English-Chinese, Chinese-English, Russian-Chinese, and 
German-Chinese. The Kuai Yitong 863 series of MTSs, developed 
and marketed in cooperation with Hong Kong's Quanzhi [2938 2535] 
Company, are now in mass production with a scale indicated by 
annual sales of 600 million yuan, direct benefits of $5.1 
million to the State, and fixed assets of over $8 million. A 
while back, the original CAS MTC pooled its research talent with 
Quanzhi's investment capital to form the joint venture Shenzhen 
Kezhi [4430 2535] (``Sci-Sense'') Language Information 
Processing Ltd., the strongest and richest language information 
processing industrial base. The third base or center, 
specializing in technical training, admitted 12 MS candidates 
and 1 Ph.D. candidate last year, and this year will admit an 
additional 10 master's students and 4 Ph.D. students.

Processing Software''] 
  [Summary] After a year of trial use with satellite-captured 
data, the nation's first domestic workstation RIPS 
(remote-sensing image processing system) processing software, 
developed in 1992-1993 by the Inner Mongolia Remote Sensing 
Center (IMRSC) has proven more flexible than a large number of 
comparable imported systems in use here in China. This software 
system, which operates via windows interfaces throughout, will 
save on State outlays for such imported systems, which cost 
several hundred thousand dollars. It is understood that IMRSC 
has just finished development on a second-generation RIPS.

<F P=106> [Article by Tang Dongning [3282 2639 1337]: ``Knowledge </F>
Engineering: A Key to 21st-Century S&amp;T Development''] 
  [Summary] This writer is fortunate to have been granted an 
interview with fuzzy mathematics theory and applications 
specialist Prof. Wang Peizhuang [3076 1014 8369] of the Fuzzy 
Mathematics Institute at Beijing Teachers' University. This 
world-renowned scholar, China People's Political Consultative 
Committee member and concurrently China Branch Director of the 
International Fuzzy Systems Association (IFSA), expounded on the 
history of fuzzy mathematics theory and applications in China 
and on the bright prospects for applications of fuzzy logic in 
the S&amp;T of the coming century. One of the specific benchmarks 
he brought up was his research team's development of the world's 
second prototype computer built with fuzzy inference engine 
discrete components; Dr. Wang's team achieved a 50 percent 
increase in speed [from 10 million inferences per second to 15 
million inferences per second] and a reduction of 90 percent in 
the machine's physical volume compared to the world's first such 
prototype, developed by Japanese Professor Takeshi Yamakawa and 
announced on [11 July] 1987 [details in JPRS-CST-88-014, 25 Jul 
88 pp 116-117 and in JPRS-CST-90-027, 29 Oct 90 pp 13-14]. Dr. 
Wang also mentioned China's world-class research on fuzzy 
control of inverted pendulums [details in JPRS-CST-92-012, 18 
Jun 92 p 53]. Finally, he stressed the value of knowledge 
engineering in future development of a variety of disciplines, 
including weather forecasting, seismology, industry (especially 
metallurgy), home electronics, economic planning, management, 
transport, banking and finance, and education.

[3076 2429 4426] of the Dept. of Information &amp; Control 
Engineering, Xian Jiaotong Univ., Xian 710049: ``Real-Time 
Polarization-Diverse Feature Extract ion, Automated Target 
Identification of Radar Aerial Targets via ANN Techniques''; MS 
received Jul 92, revised Jun 93] 
  [Abstract] A method that maps the polarization-diverse 
feature extract ion problem onto the Liapunov energy function of 
the Hopfield linear programming additive neural network (ANN) is 
presented to obtain a real-time solution of these features 
derived from the polarization ellipse corresponding to the major 
scattering centers. Then these features are transformed to 
enable free use of Carpenter and Grossberg's ART2 [Adaptive 
Resonance Theory 2] ANN for automated radar target 
identification of aircraft. 
  In the computer simulation experiment, the total number of 
learning patterns selected was eight and the number of input 
features was six (three parameters each for the engine inlet and 
the tail); after numerous self-regulation training cycles, the 
technique was able to accurately recognize four aircraft 
targets--Concorde, DC-10, 707, and 747--with a minimum warning 
line (i.e. threshold value) of 0.3. The one figure shows the 
polarization ellipse, while the one table compares values for 
the six features of all four aircraft calculated via reference 
[1] with those calculated by the authors' method.

<F P=106> [Article by Xie Ning [6200 1337]: ``First Domestic Laser </F>
Rapid Automatic Forming Machine Unveiled''] 
  [Summary] China has just realized a breakthrough in 
advanced manufacturing technology. The nation's first 
domestically made laser rapid prototyping machine--developed, 
designed and made by Beijing Longyuan [7127 3293] Enterprises 
Ltd.--was unveiled the other day in Beijing, and has been put 
into formal operation. This new unit, model STILY-I, employs the 
[stereolithography (SLA)] additive technique in which various 
layers of material are selectively built up into the solid 
prototype by a laser whose scan sequences are controlled by 
CAD/CAM databases. The total process includes laser-heated 
powder sintering [i.e. selective laser sintering (SLS)], induced 
liquid photopolymer material [cut-out], and induced vapor-phase 
deposition for gradually building up [and curing] the final 
solid plastic, ceramic or wax model. [The wax models are then 
used to create ceramic molds for fabricating final prototype 
products--FBIS].

  [Summary] On 21 October 1993, scientists at the Institute 
of Nuclear Physics and Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of 
Engineering Physics (CAEP) conducted a successful [.sup]3[/] 
He-Ar-Xe (wavelength = 1.73 microns) laser

Reactor facility, achieving laser output at a power of 24 mV 
[apparently a reference to the voltage level of the oscilloscope 
waveform, reproduced below--FBIS]. This breakthrough in 
domestic research on nuclear-pumped lasers also realized a 
thermal neutron injection rate of 6 x 10[.sup]14[/] 
n/cm[.sup]2[/]-s after polyethylene moderation. Based on the 
moderator structure, we designed an internal gas-filled 
amplifier tube assembly with the following pressure proportional 
mix: [.sup]3[/]He:Ar:Xe = 3.47 x 10[.sup]4[/]:3.47 x 
10[.sup]4[/]:2.67 x 10[.sup]2[/] (Pa); tube length is 
600mm and diameter is 34mm. With about 1.4 x 10[.sup]16[/] 
fissions per pulse, using a plano-concave cavity stabilizer, we 
did a total of eight shots in the experiment and the results of 
all eight firings are essentially in agreement. The observed 
waveform is shown below in Figure 2 [Fig. 1, not reproduced, 
shows a photograph of the experimental apparatus].

``Bipulse-Drive-Generated High-Gain X-Ray Laser Experiment 
Successful''] 
  [Summary] From 20 October to 19 November 1993, scientists 
at Laboratory 214 of the Southwest Institute of Nuclear Physics 
and Chemistry (SINPC) conducted a series of X-ray laser 
experiments. Using the LF-12 laser facility, and guided by X-ray 
laser theoretical research done at the Beijing Institute of 
Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics, the SINPC 
scientists successfully observed two electron-collision-excited 
Ne-like Ge X-ray laser gain lines--one at 19.6 nm and one at 
23.6 nm. The scientists used a narrow-pulse-width, low-energy 
bipulse laser drive and a thin-film target. In 
electron-collision-excited mechanism research, this is the first 
report worldwide of successful realization of high-gain X-ray 
lasing with a low-energy, mid/high-power-density laser.

  [Text] Abundant nonlinear processes may be produced in 
submillimeter-size hohlraum targets by 1.053 m laser light 
with duration of 1 ns and energy of 300-600 J. In experiments, 
Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) and Stimulated Raman 
Scattering (SRS) were directly measured, and Resonance 
Absorption (RA), Two-Plasmon Decay (TPD), and Ion Acoustic Decay 
(IAD) were observed indirectly. The experimental results show 
that SBS and SRS are the dominant nonlinear processes in cavity; 
they can scatter about 40 percent of the incident laser energy. 
Electron plasma waves stimulated by nonlinear processes such as 
SRS, TPD, RA, and IAD are the sources of suprathermal electron 
generation. Our research indicates that SRS is the chief process 
for electron plasma-wave generation in hohlraum targets, and it 
can produce suprathermal electrons with a total energy about 10 
percent of incident laser energy. Because spectra of nonlinear 
process scattering light are closely related to the plasma 
state, we can obtain information about the plasma state through 
intensive measurement and analysis of these spectra of the 
scattering light.

  [Summary] Hefei (ZHONGGUO KEXUE BAO wire report) -- The 
nation's first ozone laser radar (LIDAR) was put into operation 
on 28 December 1993. In the 2-odd months since then, this ozone 
LIDAR has provided a set of data on the vertical distribution of 
the ozone concentration in the 15-4O-km altitude range. The 
results obtained by the researchers so far coincide with those 
obtained by scientists in the U.S., Japan, and other countries. 
This ozone LIDAR was developed by CAS Anhui Institute of Optics 
&amp; Fine Mechanics (AIOFM) Research Fellow Hu Huanling [517O 
2970 
7117], supported by grants from the 863 Program and the NSFC. 
Researcher Hu used AIOFM's independently developed excimer 
laser and a double-wavelength operating system with a YAG 
[yttrium-aluminum garnet] frequency tripled output to conduct 
differential absorption LIDAR (DIAL) measurements of the ozone.

Breakthrough in Neutron Radiography Technology''] 
  [Summary] Changchun, 13 Apr (XINHUA) A miniature portable 
neutron radiography system with applications in national 
defense, aerospace, and other leading edge scientific areas was 
recently developed by the Physics Deparment at Northeast 
Teachers' University (NTU) and just passed formal appraisal here 
in Changchun. This non-destructive testing equipment, heavier 
forms of which have long been used for nuclear reactor 
monitoring, can now be conveniently used out in the field for a 
variety of other tests. The key to the completion of this task, 
which the NTU researchers took over 6 years ago from the 
National Defense Science, Technology and Industry Commission, 
was the development of the scintillation augmentation screen, 
whose main performance parameters--especially imaging speed and 
resolution have been certified by the experts to meet the best 
current international standards. The system, which has a sealed 
neutron source tube, can take either film photographs or can 
send low-light-level cumulative images to a computer for further 
enhancement.

``Development of 0.50-Micron LDD PMOS Technology''; MS received 
Nov 92, revised Jan 93] 
  [Abstract] To develop high-reliability submicron VLSI 
circuits, it is necessary to suppress the serious PMOS 
[p-channel metal oxide semiconductor] hot-carriers effect. Our 
investigation of the 0.50-micron LDD [lightly doped drain] PMOS 
process indicates that the LDD can greatly suppress the 
hot-carriers effect, short-channel effect, and the hot 
electron-induced punch through (HEIP) effect in the PMOS 
material. Finally, we have developed an optimum LDD PMOS process 
and have applied it to fabricate 0.50-micron ICs. 
  On N (resistivity = 1-2 ohm-cm) silicon wafers, we have 
adopted the PMOS process. After polysilicon-gate fabrication 
(gate oxide layer thickness of about 28 nm), we did the LDD 
preparation with the following process flow chart: 
  (a) BF[.sub]2[/][.sup]+[/] implantation to form lightly 
doped P[.sup]-[/] region; implantation dose = 7 x 
10[.sup]12[/]-8 x 1O[.sup]13[/]/cm[.sup]2[/], 
implantation energy = 25-60 keV. 
  (b) LPCVD [low-pressure chemical vapor deposition] 
SiO[.sub]2[/], 400 nm. 
  (c) CHF[.sub]3[/] RIE [reactive ion etching] 
SiO[.sub]2[/] to 
form 0.20-nm Si0[.sub]2[/] side wall. 
  (d) Side-wall mask BF[.sub]2[/][.sup]+[/] heavy 
implantation to form S/D P[.sup]+[/] doping; implantation 
conditions: 40 keV, 2 x 10[.sup]15[/]/cm[.sup]2[/]. 
  (e) Annealing for 30 min at 950 C to form the LDD 
structure. 
  After this, a conventional CMOS [complementary metal oxide 
semiconductor] process is used to complete device fabrication. 
  Using this optimized PMOS LDD process combined with an 
optimized NMOS LDD and a self-aligned titanium-silicide process, 
we have developed a set of submicron CMOS processes. ICs 
fabricated with this process include a 0.5-micron 
voltage-controlled oscillator [VCO] with a 600 MHz speed and a 
gate delay of 130 ps [picoseconds], as well as other submicron 
circuits, with very good results [refs. 11-12]. 
  Five figures show various relationships among device 
parameters. There are no tables.

  Advances have been made in research on high-power 
quantum-well laser diodes especially applicable to domestic 
all-solid-state lasers. Last year, the institute developed 
AlGaAs and InGaAs quantum-well laser diodes for solid-state 
laser pump sources--an achievement closely tracking the world 
state-of-the-art. 
  3. Micropackaging, Microassemblies/Micromodules 
  In development of micropackaged devices, microassemblies and 
micromodules, the institute has made advances meeting early-9Os 
international standards. The HE48I-487 miniature VCO IC meets 
late-80s international standards. 
  4. Process Technologies 
  In 1993 the institute undertook 10 military-product 
early-phase research projects, among which outstanding 
achievements were development of an all-planar process for 
fabricating the model E/D 2000-gate GaAs gate-array device and 
development of performance evaluation theory and methods for 
hardening and ruggedizing devices.

  [Text] Micro-submicrometer [5,3,1, and 0.7 m] P-MOSFETs 
have been investigated using a recently developed electron-beam 
doping technique. It is shown that the doping technique can be 
used for fabrication of micro-submicrometer MOSFETs. The 
P-MOSFETs fabricated show excellent device properties: smaller 
leakage, good I[.sub]d[/]-V[.sub]d[/] characteristics, 
shallow and uniform junction depth and smaller effect of lateral 
doping for drain and source. This doping technique is compatible 
with conventional MOS technology. Furthermore the equipment used 
is not very complicated and expensive, and the process is very 
simple. Therefore it is a very promising technique for 
fabrication of devices, especially for VLSI processing.

<F P=106> [Article: ``New DRAM Manufacturer to Be Created in Taiwan: </F>
Government Research Organization Will Become an Enterprise''] 
  [Abstract] A new DRAM manufacturer will be created in 
Taiwan. Deputy director Chintay Shih of the governmental 
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) revealed plans 
to establish a new DRAM-producing company. The Electronics 
Research and Service Organization (ERSO), one of ITRI's 
departments, will be the parent body of the new manufacturer. It 
has completed the development of a new 16-MB DRAM chip using 
0.5-micron technology. The process will use 200-mm wafers. The 
production line created by ERSO for trial production of the chip 
will be expanded for full-scale production purposes. The 
manufacturing facility is located in the Hsinchu High-Technology 
Park. The name of the company, the size of its investment, and 
the annual output, are still undecided. The possibility of a 
funding consortium consisting of several manufacturers is now 
being explored. 
  ERSO is one of 11 subdivisions of ITRI. Its Submicron 
Project 
includes 0.5-micron CMOS (16 MB DRAM) development and also 
0.35-micron and smaller CMOS development by National Nanodevice 
Laboratories, established in 1992. 
  The 0.5-micron 16-MB DRAM chip was designed by Etron 
Technology of Taiwan. Etron's founder, Nicky C. C. Lu, is a 
former IBM DRAM designer. According to Mr. Lu, the 16-MB DRAM 
chip is a first-generation chip, with an area of 100 
mm[.sup]2[/], in a 400-mil package. A stacked memory cell 
design will be used. The technology for the more recent trench 
process is not yet available in Taiwan. The second-generation 
chip will be a synchronous DRAM for high-speed data 
transmission. An attempt will be made to use the 
``lead-on-chip'' (LOC) technology. The search for an existing 
manufacturer who can implement this technology is now under way. 
  The TI-Acer company of Taiwan is now producing 4-MB DRAM. In 
Phase 1 of the Fab 1 stage, 1500 units a month of 0.8-micron 
technology 150-mm equivalent chips will be produced. Phase 2 is 
scheduled to get under way in 1995. The total output will be 
24,000 units per month. Mosel Vitelic, a DRAM-oriented company 
that produces for the Taiwan electrical engineering industry, is 
setting up a clean room to meet 0.5-micron standards. Operation 
is expected to begin this year. Taiwan's largest LSI producer, 
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (TSMC), plans 
to produce DRAM under the Fab 3 stage, which began in December 
1993. 
  Taiwan's Department of Economics is backing this effort to 
create a DRAM project from existing enterprises and government 
research organizations. In December 1992, the ministry 
designated 66 systems and components as key projects for 
stepped-up effort in order to replace imported products. The 66 
designated products are grouped into three ranks. Rank A 
consists of products for which the Department of Economics has 
created a technology development project team and is carrying on 
the R&amp;D. Rank B consists of technologies for which a 
subdivision 
of the Industrial Office has created a development plan for 
joint implementation by two or more enterprises. Rank C consists 
of projects in which enterprises are investing, with government 
support in order to facilitate production.

Challenge to Battle''; cf. JPRS-CST-94-007, 3 May 94 p 19] 
  [Summary] Beijing, 11 Mar (KEJI RIBAO report) -- Should not 
China seize the opportunity to formulate policies for yet 
another ``information revolution''--that of the ``information 
highways?'' To this end, KEJI RIBAO today convened an 
Information Highway Expert Symposium; at this forum, the experts 
unanimously agreed that our nation, faced with a rare 
opportunity in world history, should quickly take action 
appropriate to national conditions. These specialists also felt 
that China, compared to advanced nations--especially the U.S., 
with its National Information Infrastructure (NII) program--lags 
behind in economic power, but that China nonetheless should 
accelerate its strategic in-depth planning and concentrate its 
attention on this second information revolution that will 
inevitably foster future economic and social development. 
Specifically, the experts urged that domestic information 
resources be disseminated throughout the society, be 
market-oriented, and incorporate international developments--all 
in step-by-step, gradually accelerated fashion.

electronic information changes that are sweeping the nation. Ni 
noted the ``National Economic Informationization'' slogan [for 
the ``Golden Bridge Project''] now being proposed by various 
authorities: it essentially refers to a debate on how to best 
determine the influence of this [second] ``Information 
Revolution'' on 2lst-century S&amp;T development. Ni said that 
the 
high-speed information networks now being developed worldwide 
can bring into reality for mankind the type of things only 
dreamed about in the past and incorporated in the science 
fiction novels of the past few decades. In closing, Ni noted 
that the ``Three Golden Projects'' now being implemented under 
State direction are without question the proper direction that 
China should take and will inevitably promote domestic S&amp;T 
development into the next century.

Digital Data Network''] 
  [Summary] To implement an ``Information Highway'' and to 
provide high-speed data communications, MPT is now building a 
national public digital data network (DDN). In this DDN 
project, MPT will import from Canada a 3600 bandwidth management 
system and from the U.S. some DACS 11-2000 digital cross-connect 
(DXC) equipment. DXC node computers will be installed in 24 
provinces and municipalities nationwide. The main channels of 
this DDN are scheduled to be completed and operational by July 
of this year. DDN users will be provided with digital channels 
for data/image/videoconference transmission services at a 
variety of bit rates up to and including 2 Mbps, and will have 
trans-provincial transmission capabilities via public 
telecommunications networks, packet-switching networks, and 
local/provincial-level DDNs now being built.

State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC), Department for 
Basic Research and High Technology: ``Value the Building of an 
Information Infrastructure''] 
  [Summary] [Editor's note] Chief Engineer Ji Fusheng was 
one of the distinguished participants in the ``Information 
Highway'' Symposium recently held by KEJI RIBAO. [End of 
editor's note.] 
  I feel that planning for information highways has already 
grasped several key factors in current social development. Up 
to the year 2020, information technology will remain a hot topic 
and will remain in a decisive position amid international 
competition. Setting out from present national conditions, 
authorities and technologists must focus on building an 
infrastructure for information services. Building an 
information infrastructure is an indispensable condition for the 
people's economic modernization. This new infrastructure is not 
limited to telephone service, however; modern conditions require 
that a gradually increasing percentage of all telecommunications 
services be devoted to data and image transmission. Therefore, 
in planning for and constructing our national information 
infrastrucutre, we must start out by meeting the demands of 
integrated services [i.e., those provided in integrated services 
digital networks (ISDNs)]. Our domestic campaign is fully 
capable of incorporating the latest worldwide S&amp;T 
achievements. 
In the area of technical progress, China is also fully capable 
of leaping over several historical stages of development 
experienced by advanced nations in their development course. At 
the same time, we must be practical and realistic, and must 
chart out our path according to scientific research into market 
demand. The State has already taken some steps in strategic 
development of an information infrastructure, such as 863 
Program support for research on high-speed parallel computing 
and high-speed communications, but the strength of this R&amp;D 
effort is still insufficient. The State should firm up its 
outline for constructing an information infrastructure, utilize 
existing resources, and make appropriate additions to its 
financial support for this infrastructure.

Gaozhi [7559 2535] S&amp;T Development Co and its partner firm, 
Shanghai Xinhua Computer &amp; Electronic Information Co, have 
developed, designed, installed, and put on-line a satellite 
digital transmission network--the ``Space Highway Network'' or 
``Information Bridge''--for the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE). 
This network provides instantaneous (0.5 s) synchronous 
transmission of stock and economic information from the SSE to 
over 1000 small satellite earth stations nationwide, many of 
them hundreds and thousands of km distant from the SSE. The 
network has also been successfully used for newspaper fax 
transmission: in only 20 minutes, the network system can provide 
errorless transmission of an 8-page issue of WEN HUI BAO to nine 
regional printing plants nationwide. This service has been in 
operation for 6 months without any errors. The satellite used 
to relay these services is located at an altitude of 36,000 km.

<F P=106> [Article by Wu Jiapei [3527 1367 1014], State Information </F>
Center (SIC) Vice-Director (and participant in aforementioned 
KEJI RIBAO Symposium): ``Some Reflections on the Global 
Information Infrastructure Tide''] 
  [Summary] China has had enough of the bitter taste of a 
backward information infrastructure. If the nation does not now 
work out such an infrastructure, then by the next century--even 
though the old ``bottleneck'' restrictions may be resolved--a 
new ``bottleneck'' will appear: the added difficulty of 
[jointly] raising industrial competitiveness and the State's 
comprehensive national power. China's present level in 
information technology is 30-40 years behind that of the U.S. 
To raise industrial competitiveness and the State's overall 
national power, China must firmly take up the task of building 
an information infrastructure suited to domestic conditions, 
incorporating innovative technologies and management practices, 
documented by relevant laws and standards, and based on research 
and surveys into the economic and social benefits of this global 
tide. So far, China's information infrastructure building has 
been government-driven, unlike the market-driven form seen in 
the U.S. This situation needs to be changed: non-government 
investment must be encouraged, industrial activity and the 
entrepreneurial spirit must be part of the overall campaign; 
industry leaders must no longer rely on the government alone 
before taking action. In the area of resource allocation, the 
government has invested over 20 billion yuan, which went for 
construction of a dozen-odd major information systems, and is 
investing an additional 50 billion yuan for construction of 
information systems at as many as 10,000 firms.

  [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- A U.S. expert on data 
networking today described China's ``Golden Bridge'' project to 
build up an information superhighway as a powerful tool for 
promoting administrative efficiency, fostering improved 
communications and coordination between the government, 
companies and people of the whole country. 
  At a seminar on building information superhighways for the 
next century, Eric Benhamou, President of the U.S. 3Com 
Corporation, delivered a keynote speech to Chinese officials and 
engineers drawn from relevant ministries and research 
institutes. ``A Golden Bridge that spans both government and 
private sector will elevate China to a major economic player on 
the world stage,'' said Benhamou, who is concurrently Chairman 
of the American Electronics Association's National Information 
Infrastructure (NII) task force. He added that as information 
increasingly becomes the currency of international trade, the 
Golden Bridge will enable China to tap into global information 
flows, further integrating China into the global economy. 
  Benhamou believes that by using the Golden Bridge to provide 
database access and facilitating electronic data interchange, 
China's society will rapidly enter the information age. It can 
also inform and educate by liberating resources and bring health 
care and scientific, commercial, and financial data to the 
individual. He suggested that China should choose the best 
scheme in constructing an information project, so as to avert 
the setbacks that have been experienced by Western countries. 
At the same time, China should rationally balance the rules for 
informational market competition--allow competition while 
maintaining macro control. He revealed that the 3Com 
Corporation will shortly set up a representative office in 
Beijing, in a bid to help develop a pool of networking expertise 
in China.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- China has mapped out an 
ambitious plan to build its own information superhighway with a 
focus on an information application system, a nationwide public 
data service network and an advanced telecommunications network. 
In a recent symposium on the wide use of information in the 
national economy and China's information superhighway, Minister 
of Posts &amp; Telecommunications Wu Jichuan said China will 
watch 
closely the world's latest developments in information 
superhighway construction and carry out its own in a planned and 
step-by-step manner. He said China will expand the application 
of computers in digital [telephone] exchanges, accelerate the 
construction of optical fibers and build an internet by 
developing a network telecommunications platform based on the 
country's public telecommunications network. 
  The symposium, attended by China's senior officials and 
information experts, exchanged information on the world's 
current trend of information superhighway construction, its 
definition and its social economic significance. China's 
demands for such a highway and its potential were widely 
discussed at the symposium, the first of its kind in China. 
  As part of the effort to cope with the world's new 
information revolution, China is busy building 22 national-level 
optical fiber trunk lines to connect all the provincial 
capitals, 20 digital microwave trunk lines, and large and 
medium-sized satellite telecommunications ground stations. 
According to government sources, the high-capacity digital 
transmission network connecting the country's major provincial 
capitals will be completed early next year. First-phase 
construction of a nationwide digital switching network was 
completed last September. At present, the network extends to 
267 of China's major cities and has started to exchange 
information with 37 centers in 20 countries and regions. 
Meanwhile, the first-phase project of the high-speed digital 
trunk line connecting 21 provinces and municipalities will be 
put into operation this July. A cellular phone network has 
covered the coastal provinces in the Southeast and some central 
provinces. 
  Viewing the current level of information modernization, 
experts said that the 700,000 mobile telephones will be linked 
by a nationwide network soon. China's 7 million radio pagers 
have made the country one of the world's largest paging markets. 
Computers have been widely used in banking, customs clearance, 
railway transportation, civil aviation and weather forecasting. 
These, in all, will contribute to China's information 
modernization, experts commented. 
  As another major step in the construction of the information 
superhighway, China plans to accelerate high-tech research 
concerned with information modernization, especially advanced 
remote sensing, surveying, computers, automation facilities and 
modern telecommunications technologies. 
  The construction of the information superhighway is a 
systematic project which will involve different fields of work, 
said Minister Wu Jichuan. He called on the joint efforts of 
participating departments to work toward erecting the modern 
information network.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- By the end of this 
century, China will finish construction of a major 
telecommunications network composed of 16 optical cable trunk 
lines, which will cover all the provincial capitals and become 
connected with the world's network. Minister of Posts &amp; 
Telecommunications Wu Jichuan said today that the Ninth 5-Year 
Plan (1996-2000) for telecommunications development has been 
initially drafted. He said that in the new plan priority is 
given to construction of long-distance optical cable networks. 
  According to major targets set in the plan, the ministry's 
total business volume will have an annual average growth rate of 
23.7 percent, while the annual average growth rate for its 
business income will be 24.2 percent. Wu said that fulfillment 
of the plan will bring the national telephone capacity from the 
present 42 million lines up to 140 million lines, and the 
national telephone availability rate will reach 8 percent, while 
that for urban areas will reach 30-40 percent. In addition, 
mobile telephones will cover all the country's large and 
medium-sized cities, as well as most of the towns, basically 
realizing national automatic roaming. 
  The ministry will establish its own air postal routes and 
improve other postal facilities to shorten mail delivery time. 
Meanwhile, computer networks will be established for EMS 
[electronic mail system] inquiries, issuing of publications, 
postal management, postal deposit and other business. 
  Posts and telecommunications have been experiencing the 
fastest development among all the country's industries in the 
past few years. Last year its growth rate reached 59 percent, 
exceeding the development speed of the national economy for the 
ninth successive year. An official from the ministry predicted 
that this year the sector will maintain a development speed of 
about 50 percent. 
  To ensure that the targets set in the plan be fulfilled, the 
ministry has drafted a huge budget of 360 billion yuan for the 
construction of posts and telecommunications infrastructures. 
At present, China's telecommunications capacity ranks seventh 
in the world; if all these targets are met, it will be able to 
edge into the world's first three positions.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Yong: ``Motorola Homing In on Beeper </F>
Market''] 
  [Text] The U.S. telecommunications giant Motorola is to 
increase its production of beepers in China in order to tap the 
potential of the local market. ``We will expand production by 
at least 50 percent this year,'' said K.Y. Chan, sales director 
of Motorola's North Asia Paging Products Group. 
  There is plenty of room for expansion in China. This is 
because there are 400 million city dwellers in the country but 
only 10 million pagers. In developed countries, on the other 
hand, 12 out of 100 people have pagers. 
  In 1992, Motorola invested more than $100 million into its 
manufacturing base in Tianjin City, North China. And so far, 
the plant has churned out more than 1 million beepers priced at 
1000 yuan ($115) each. 
  ``There are about 3 million Motorola pagers in use in China 
at present, if imports from Singapore are included,'' Chan said. 
Singapore is the leading manufacturing base of Motorola in the 
Asia-Pacific region, providing nearly all the pagers which 
display information with Chinese characters. But towards the 
end of the year the Tianjin base will also start producing 
pagers with Chinese characters, said Chan. He did not say how 
many such pagers will be produced per year in the future. 
  Motorola's biggest potential rivals in China include Japan's 
NEC and some Chinese manufacturers from Guangdong Province in 
the South. The American company has captured a third of the 
Chinese pager market. And the multinational firm has also 
cornered more than half of the global market which requires 15 
million beepers a year. 
  ``Motorola's top three markets are the U.S., Japan and 
China, 
and we are anticipating a bigger local production in China,'' 
said Chan. 
  Motorola staged a sales promotion campaign in Beijing 
recently, selling more than 23,000 pagers. 
  Statistics show that the number of China's pagers increased 
by 152 percent in 1993 over the previous year. And the 
country's telecommunications market has grown rapidly, said Liu 
Cai, head of the policy department of the Ministry of Posts &amp; 
Telecommunications. But he admitted that telephone systems, 
particularly mobile [phones] and beepers, are still in their 
infancy in China. By the year 2000, China will have more than 5 
million mobile phones, he said. 
  And the number of pagers is expected to boom during the same 
period. Pagers will become one of the most sought-after consumer 
goods in the 1990s, an official said.

<F P=106> [Article by Pei Jianfeng: ``IBM to Invest in Data Network''] </F>
  [Text] International Business Machines (IBM) will invest at 
least $100 million in information technology projects in China, 
the U.S. computer giant announced yesterday in Beijing. This 
will include being the first foreign company to be involved in 
the country's top information infrastructure project. ``It is a 
major step in relations between IBM and China and will be 
beneficial to both sides,'' said IBM Vice-President Robert M. 
Stephenson. 
  The deals come under a memorandum of understanding signed 
last Thursday in the U.S. between Big Blue and the Ministry of 
Electronics Industry during Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua's 
visit. 
  The first project will set up a joint venture in Beijing 
with 
Jitong Communications Company, which oversees the Three Golden 
Projects, China's information infrastructure plan. The massive 
project aims to set up economic information networks across the 
country covering banking, customs and inter-governmental 
exchanges. The joint venture will produce networking 
technologies to support the plan. 
  In the first phase, it will help design and install regional 
communications networks and link them into a national system, 
said Robert M. Savage, Chairman of IBM China Company Ltd. He 
said IBM will pump several million dollars into the venture, 
which will be finalized in 6 weeks. More importantly, the 
company will bring in experts from its system integration 
divisions in the U.S. and Europe, he said. 
  IBM has been named as consultant to the project as well as 
other technology proposals by the Ministry of Electronics 
Industry. Under the memorandum of understanding, IBM will 
establish a wholly-owned software development centre in Shanghai 
to develop system and application programmes for the domestic 
and foreign markets, Stephenson said. It will also set up three 
open system networking centres in Beijing, Shanghai and 
Guangzhou. 
  In return, China pledged to use IBM's PowerPC platform as 
one 
of the major microprocessors in planning the country's future. 
PowerPC, a chip jointly developed by IBM, Apple and Motorola, 
seeks to break Intel's world monopoly on the computer.

<F P=106> [Article by Liu Weiling: ``AT&amp;T Inks Two Deals to Supply </F>
Equipment''] 
  [Text] American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) signed 
two 
contracts over the weekend to supply the most modern 
transmission and network management equipment to the Beijing 
Telecommunications Administration (BTA). The deals, totaling 
more than $20 million, will give the city the largest and most 
sophisticated digital transmission network in China. It will 
also result in the city having the most advanced network 
management capabilities for the surveillance and control of its 
entire public telecommunications network. 
  The sale represents the first time AT&amp;T will supply 
high-speed transmission equipment to China since the demise of 
the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Control 
[COCOM]. The 17-member organization controlled technology 
transfer to the East Bloc for 44 years and ceased to exist on 
April 1. 
  Under these contracts, AT&amp;T will supply BTA with two 
state-of-the-art systems: SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) 
fibre optic transmission equipment operating at 2.488 Gb/s 
(gigabits per second) and a set of advanced network management 
and surveillance systems to monitor and manage the 
communications network. 
  With the equipment, Beijing will be able to offer advanced 
telecommunications services and have the flexibility to move 
forward with new services, according to BTA officials. Zhang 
Ligui, Director General of BTA, said the signing of the two 
AT&amp;T/BTA agreements signifies that cooperation between 
AT&amp;T and 
Beijing has entered a new stage. 
  William Warwick, Chairman of AT&amp;T China Incorporated, 
said, 
``We see these projects as an important milestone in building 
our relationship with the BTA. This is our first delivery of 
SDH technology to China since President Clinton lifted export 
controls on high-speed transmission sales,'' Warwick added. 
  AT&amp;T currently has nine joint ventures in China.

  -- And a comprehensive network management programme with the 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications that will handle the 
sale and development of hardware and software systems for 
network surveillance, management and control. 
  The programme should alleviate problems in China's vast 
telecommunications system. 
  ``AT&amp;T is committed to providing China with digital and 
fibre-optic technologies that are the latest and best in the 
world so it can leapfrog almost overnight into the information 
age,'' said William Warwick, chairman of AT&amp;T China. 
  The company yesterday also agreed to explore remaining areas 
of co-operation outlined in last year's memorandum. 
  Since the signing in February 1993, AT&amp;T has secured 
more 
than $500 million in sales contracts and last year doubled its 
1992 revenues in China. 
  The company has already set up nine joint ventures in the 
country; they are engaged in marketing wireless systems, 
international long-distance services, computer products and 
networks.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhu Fuchang [26i2 4395 2490]: ``Nations Second </F>
High-Capacity Fiber Optic Communications Cable Operational by 
Year's End''] 
  [Summary] Following upon last year's completion of the 
nation's first high-capacity fiber optic communications 
cable--the Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou overhead 12-fiber optical 
cable--China this year will build its second high-capacity 
cable: a buried multi-fiber cable linking these same three 
cities and scheduled for completion by year's end. This 
project, which uses new-generation domestically made digital 
fiber optic communications equipment developed by MPT's Wuhan 
Institute of P&amp;T Science, will employ the 1B1H encoding 
format 
suited to China's needs. The project employs a number of 
advanced technologies, including VLSI circuits and thick-film 
circuits, integrated digital signal processing/computer 
techniques, and miniaturized, low-loss, high-reliability 
equipment. Each system, in addition to the 1920 circuits 
provided in the main channel, can furnish an additional 1200 
circuits (an increase of 62.5 percent capacity) via application 
of the ``H'' code. The Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou buried optical 
cable project, funded by a loan from the Asian Development Bank, 
employed international tenders. After sharp competition, the 
contract was awarded to MPT's Meishan Communications Equipment 
Plant.

Power in Northwest China Enters Period of Major Development, 
More Investments in 1993 To Accelerate Construction of More Than 
10 Key State Hydropower and Thermal Power Projects"] 
  [Text] After the northwest China region placed 1,750MW of 
installed electric power generating capacity into operation in 
1992, it also invested in 1993 to speed up construction of more 
than 10 key state hydropower and thermal power projects, which 
is an indication that northwest China's electric power industry 
has entered a period of major development. 
  A large electric power construction army numbering tens of 
thousands in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang now 
has the attitude of a decisive battle and is fighting in the 
barren and dangerous valleys in the upper reaches of the Huang 
He, the "Black Belt" of Guanzhong [central Shaanxi plain], and 
other construction sites as an unceasing high tide of 
construction appears in each project. At the large Lijia Gorge 
hydropower station, where they plan to install the four biggest 
Chinese-made generators with unit capacities of 400MW, after 
impounding the river and completing excavation of the foundation 
for the key facility and making progress with other important 
construction tasks, they entered the key construction phase for 
pouring the concrete for the 165-meter-tall dam and main plant 
buildings between April and July 1993. This 3,110MW power 
generation facility now under construction will go into 
operation and begin generating power at the end of 1993. 
  At the end of 1992, northwest China's installed generating 
capacity was 14,417MW and its annual power output was 60.093 
billion kWh, with hydropower accounting for nearly one-half of 
this amount. 
  Development of its hydropower resources is northwest China's 
first step in electric power construction. While developing 
Ankang, Shiquan, Bikou, and other hydropower stations on the Han 
Jiang and Bailong Jiang, Shaanxi and Gansu have also joined with 
Qinghai and Ningxia to concentrate their superior forces in the 
main attack on one of China's biggest hydropower "motherlodes" 
on the upper reaches of the Huang He by completing five cascade 
hydropower stations represented by the two big hydropower 
stations at Longyang Gorge and Liujia Gorge and including Yanguo 
Gorge, Bapan Gorge, Qingtong Gorge with a total installed 
generating capacity of 3,268MW. Statistics show that between the 
time the first generator began generating electricity in 1961 
and the end of September 1993, these five hydropower stations 
generated a total of 21.13 million kWh. The five large 
reservoirs associated with these power stations also irrigate 
more than 16 million mu of farmland along both banks of the 
river. Moreover, they have used their excellent regulation 
properties to basically resolve flooding, freezing, and other 
disasters along the banks of the middle and upper reaches of the 
Huang He, which has significantly improved the ecology and 
environment of the northwest China plateau. The area around the 
reservoirs, where not a blade of grass had grown for a long 
time, is now shaded by green trees. 
  According to the newest development program by the Northwest 
China Electric Power Industry Management Bureau and Northwest 
China Hydropower Survey and Design Academy that was revised in 
1993, besides the six power stations already built or now under 
construction on the upper reaches of the Huang He, they have 
also decided to build seven large cascade hydropower stations at 
Gongbai Gorge, Laxiwa, and other locations and 12 medium-sized 
cascade hydropower stations at Da Gorge and other locations 
which can increase the total installed generating capacity to 
15,740MW with annual power output of 57 billion kWh. Evidently, 
the timetable for the 19 new cascade hydropower stations to be 
built on the upper reaches of the Huang He has now been arranged 
and it is expected that they can all be developed by the early 
part of the next century. 
  Embodying the new idea of "changing from transporting coal 
to 
transmitting electricity," thermal power construction has 
accelerated the pace of construction of the new Pucheng power 
plant and other new construction and expansion projects in 
addition to speeding up preparatory work for construction of 
Baoji No. 2 power plant, Hancheng No. 2 power plant, and Shenmu, 
Huangling, and other large pit-mouth power plants. 
  According to information provided by officials in the 
Northwest China Electric Power Industry Management Bureau, after 
these electric power projects are gradually implemented, annual 
power output in the northwest China region will reach 69 billion 
kWh in 1995. At that time, besides satisfying the needs of 
industrial and agricultural production and the masses' lives in 
these five provinces and autonomous regions, these abundant 
power sources will also transmit power to east China, central 
China, southwest China, and other regions.

Zhang Houhai [1728 0624 3189]: "Anhui's Local Power Industry Is 
Growing by Leaps and Bounds"] 
  [Text] Anhui Province is raising capital at many levels and 
through many channels in a major effort to develop its local 
electric power industry and alleviate the entire province's 
electricity shortages. 
  To reduce its energy resource shortages, the Anhui 
Provincial 
Government has approved the establishment of the Anhui Province 
Electric Power Development Corporation to represent the 
interests of the local electric power industry, assume special 
responsibility for raising and managing capital for a 
provincial-level electric power construction fund (including the 
use of foreign investments) and for local energy resource 
project development and construction. By the end of September, 
1993, the corporation had raised a total of 2 billion yuan in 
capital for power development. It has made independent 
investments to build five 125MW generators at Hefei, Tongling, 
Ma'anshan, and other cities and it is participating in joint 
investments to establish the key state construction projects at 
the Luohe and Pingyu power plants and the Huaibei and Wuhu power 
plants for six generators with a total capacity of 1,400MW. The 
corporation has also invested over 100 million yuan in joint 
investments to complete the Huaibei Tongting Coal Mine with an 
annual coal mining capacity of 450,000 tons. 
  Apparently, Anhui Province also recently decided to use the 
Anhui Province Electric Power Development Corporation to 
organize the "Anhui Energy Company, Ltd." to issue public stock 
to raise an enormous amount of capital to accelerate 
construction of its local electric power industry and increase 
Anhui's total installed generating capacity to 10,000MW by the 
year 2000.

Wei: "Accelerating Hydropower Cascade Development, Establishing 
a Southern Electric Power Corridor, Hydropower Construction in 
Southwest Will Provide a Powerful Motive Force for Economic 
Takeoff on the Southeast Coast"] 
  [Text] Southwest China, crisscrossed by rivers, is the 
region of China with the most abundant hydropower resources. It 
has 194,000MW of developable hydropower, equal to 51.7 percent 
of China's total hydropower. Currently, six of the 12 key 
cascade development base areas being built through State plans 
are located in southwest China's Jinsha Jiang, Yalong Jiang, 
Dadu He, Lancang Jiang, Wu Jiang, and Hongshui He river basins. 
  With major efforts by the State to provide support, energy 
resource development in southwest China, which has mainly 
involved hydropower, has entered the best period in the last 
decade. According to incomplete statistics, Yunnan, Guizhou, and 
Sichuan provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region invested 
16 billion yuan in capital during the Seventh 5-Year Plan alone 
in electric power construction, more than four times greater 
than the total amount invested during the Sixth 5-Year Plan, 
adding 6,000MW in new generating capacity. As we enter the 
Eighth 5-Year Plan, the pace of construction has been further 
accelerated. During the past two years the primary grids 
completed 5.86 billion yuan in electric power construction 
investments and added 2,430MW in installed generating capacity. 
At the end of 1992, these three provinces and one autonomous 
region had a total installed electric power generating capacity 
of 20,155MW, including an installed hydropower generating 
capacity of 9,640MW. Sichuan Province, which has developed at a 
rapid pace, increased its total installed electric power 
generating capacity from 4,624MW in 1985 to 9,565MW in 1992, 
more than doubling it. 
  The deployment of energy resource development in the vast 
southwest China region is focused on cascade development of six 
large river basins. In plans for the trunks, 65 large and 
medium-sized hydropower stations have been designed with a total 
installed generating capacity scale of 120,000MW, including 11 
that have been completed or are now under construction with a 
total installed generating capacity of 10,810MW and annual power 
output of 51.92 billion kWh. According to the Ninth 5-Year Plan, 
another seven large hydropower stations with a total installed 
generating capacity of almost 20,000MW will be built in 
succession. Electric power experts predict that by the end of 
this century, the installed hydropower generating capacity in 
southwest China will increase substantially and form China's 
biggest hydropower base area cluster in these six large basins. 
  As hydropower energy resource base area construction is 
developed, southwest China's electric power industry, which had 
been backward for a long time, has begun to enter the 
development phase of large power grids, large power plants, 
large generators, high voltages, and high automation levels. In 
the early 1980s, southwest China had only two large hydropower 
stations bigger than 500MW, but today we have now completed or 
are in the process of building five hydropower stations at 
Ertan, Manwan, Yantan, and Tianshengqiao First Cascade and 
Second Cascade, all of which have installed generating 
capacities greater than 1,200MW. This is particularly true of 
Ertan Power Station in Sichuan, which has a total installed 
generating capacity of 3,300MW and six generators that will 
generate 17 billion kWh of electricity annually, the most 
electricity generated among the hydropower projects under 
construction in China in these three indicators. 
  Since 1992, we have installed three 500 kV power 
transmission 
and transformation lines, the largest in China in terms of 
capacity, between Guiyang and Tianshengqiao, Manwan and Kunming, 
and Tianshengqiao and Foshan in Guangdong, which is an 
indication that a preliminary key electric power facility 
linking south China and southwest China has been completed.

  [Text] A press conference was held on 29 October 1993 in 
the News Office of the State Council. State Council Three Gorges 
Project Construction Commission Deputy Director Guo Shuyan 
stated at the meeting that all items of initial preparations for 
the Three Gorges key water conservancy facility have begun in 
1993 and that all items of initial preparations work are 
progressing smoothly. The pace of resettlement from the dam area 
has been speeded up and resettlement program work in the 
reservoir area is now fully underway. 
  While answering reporters' questions concerning progress at 
the Three Gorges project, China Three Gorges Project Corporation 
General Manager Lu Youmei [7120 0147 2812] said that 1993 is the 
first year of preparation for construction and with an 
investment of 2 billion yuan, it will be completed. Preparations 
for open bidding for requisitioning of the land, construction of 
roads and bridges, engineering around the main project, and 
several other projects is now progressing smoothly. All of these 
will create the conditions for a comprehensive start of 
construction on the main aspects of the Three Gorges project. 
  Concerning the resettlement issue, Guo Shuyan and Three 
Gorges Project Construction Commission Resettlement and 
Development Bureau Director Tang Zhangjin [0781 4545 6930] 
refuted the rumor that China will resettle people in Xinjiang, 
Tibet, and other frontier regions. Guo Shuyan said that recently 
several news media outlets in foreign countries had transmitted 
the news that China is already resettling people in Xinjiang, 
Tibet, and other places and that this is either a 
well-intentioned misinterpretation or a pure fabrication that is 
deliberately provocative. Tang Zhangjin said that after many 
years of trials and experiments, China has accumulated rich 
experience regarding resettlement in the Three Gorges region and 
that when the project is completed 1.13 million people will have 
to be moved, with arrangements for most of them being made 
locally. 
  Concerning the prospects for international cooperation in 
the 
Three Gorges project, Guo Shuyan said that as the Three Gorges 
project gradually unfolds, international cooperation will be 
further strengthened. In November, 1993, we will invite several 
international water turbine generator manufacturers to Wuhan to 
discuss their intentions concerning cooperation, and we will 
have broad-ranging contacts with international construction 
equipment and power transmission and transformation equipment 
manufacturing companies and promote the establishment of 
Chinese-foreign joint ventures. In the area of importing 
capital, China is now studying capital-raising measures for 
importing foreign buyers' credit and issuing stocks and bonds in 
China and foreign countries at the appropriate time. He said 
that China welcomes foreign enterprises and investment 
organizations to participate in construction of the Three Gorges 
project and the Three Gorges reservoir region. 
  While answering reporters' questions concerning the issue of 
environmental protection in the Three Gorges region, Guo Shuyan 
said that construction of the Three Gorges project will have a 
beneficial effect on the ecology and environment of the middle 
and lower reaches of the Chang Jiang, especially in 
substantially improving flood control standards and making the 
water clearer. What has aroused concern in China and foreign 
countries is the reservoir inundation and resettled population 
arrangements that result from the Three Gorges project and the 
negative impact these will have on the ecology and environment. 
These have already received a high degree of attention from the 
Chinese Government and it has formulated the corresponding 
measures. He said that on the new land used for production for 
the resettled population, we will organize the building of 
rather high-level terraced fields and develop production. To 
reduce soil erosion, the State is now implementing a shelter 
forest plan for the middle and upper reaches of the Chang Jiang. 
The government will also establish several animal and plant 
protection regions to protect the valuable animal and plant 
resources in this region. Since construction of the Gezhouba 
project, we have discovered that Chinese sturgeon have 
established a new spawning ground below the dam and that the 
related areas are providing additional protection and doing a 
great deal of artificial breeding and releasing. 
  A reporter asked whether or not the investment in the Three 
Gorges project would be a factor that in causing inflation. For 
1993, investment in the Three Gorges project is 2 billion yuan 
and the average investment each year after construction of the 
project formally gets underway will be about 5 billion yuan. 
While this is a large figure, compared to China's total 
investments in fixed assets of more than 1 trillion yuan each 
year, it will only account for about 0.5 percent, so it will not 
have a significant impact or become a factor in further 
inflation. 
  Additional report: According to information provided by 
State 
Council Three Gorges Project Construction Commission Deputy 
Director Guo Shuyan, based on April 1993 price levels, the 
static investment in the entire Three Gorges project will 
require about 95.4 billion yuan renminbi. Based on policies 
already promulgated by the Chinese Government, the state will 
set aside 0.003 yuan per kWh of electricity in China, which can 
raise an average of 1.5 billion to 2.0 billion yuan renminbi per 
year. Moreover, the Gezhouba Power Station has been turned over 
to the China Chang Jiang Three Gorges Project Development 
Corporation and all the net income from the power it generates 
will be used for the Three Gorges project. These two funding 
items will provide a total of about 32.7 billion yuan renminbi 
over 11 years, equal to 62 percent of the required investment in 
the Three Gorges project over the same period.
