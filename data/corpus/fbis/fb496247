  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 7--The Janata Dal-Ajit [JD-A] 
leader, Mr. Rasheed Masood, today announced the merger of his 
party with the Samajwadi Party led by the Uttar Pradesh Chief 
Minister, Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav. The formal decision was taken 
at a national convention of the JD-A held here today, which was 
later addressed by Mr. Mulayam Singh. 
  The merger at the national level is likely to have its 
impact 
on the arithmetic in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly also and 
indications are that a section of Janata Dal MLAs [members of 
Legislative Assembly] in the State will formally join the SP-BSP 
[Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party] Government. Claiming that 
a majority of the 27 Dal MLAs were in favour of merging with the 
Samajwadi Party, the Uttar Pradesh JD-A secretary, Mr. 
Kailashnath Singh Yadav, said that a formal announcement in this 
regard will be made soon. 
  Addressing a packed audience of JD-A workers from various 
districts of Western Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Mulayam Singh stressed 
his party's role in "containing and combating" the forces of 
communalism led by the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]. Extolling 
the virtues of the Charan Singh, Mr. Yadav extended an open 
invitation to all the followers of Ram Manohar Lohia and Charan 
Singh to join the Samajwadi Party. 
  Source of strength: Even though the merger moves 
were anticipated for over a fortnight now, Mr. Mulayam Singh was 
visibly excited at the convention. Considering that the 
Samajwadi Party is relatively weak in the Western districts of 
Uttar Pradesh, the entry of Mr. Masood into the fold is indeed a 
great source of strength for the party, said his close associate. 
  Describing that the JD-A decision to merge with the SP as 
one 
conditioned by the "ground realities in Uttar Pradesh" where the 
SP had emerged "as the centre of anti-communal forces," Mr. 
Masood claimed that the entire rank and file of the Janata Dal-A 
were with him. 
  Referring to the possibility of JD MLAs joining the SP, Mr. 
Masood appeared confident of a majority falling in line. 
However, he added that for strategic reasons of not exposing the 
27 strong State legislature party to a split, the MLAs were kept 
away from today's convention. Contesting Mr. Ajit Singh's claims 
that majority of the legislature party was with him to join the 
Congress(I), the Masood camp claimed all but five MLAs out of 27 
were inclined to join the Mulayam Singh Government. 
  Fellow MP [member of Parliament], Mr. Upendranath Verma 
submitted a note of dissent on the "timing of the merger." 
Though Mr. Masood claimed that the merger decision had the 
approval of Mr. Verma and the third JD-A MP, Mr. Ram Sunder Das, 
both of them were conspicuous by their absence at the convention.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Fracturing Janata Dal"] </F>
  [Text] It is natural for the Janata Dal leaders to be upset 
and angry at the way Mulayam Singh has moved 10 Janata Dal 
legislators who supported his government into his party. This 
anger is reflected in the resolution sent by the U.P. [Uttar 
Pradesh] unit of the Janata Dal to the party's national 
president Bommai. It asked permission for the state unit of the 
party to take back the endorsement it had given to the Mulayam 
Singh government. However, a decision on this resolution is not 
expected soon because of the uncertainties and problems within 
the Janta Dal. One reason is that the disintegration of the 
Janta Dal has just begun, and even the party leaders do now know 
how many legislators will be left within the party in the end. 
They expressed fear that some of the remaining 17 Janata Dal 
legislator might join Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party. 
Another half dozen legislators are expected to follow Ajit Singh 
into the Congress Party. They were waiting until now because the 
one-third number required to avoid breaking the party-deserting 
law was not available. Now, in the shrunken Janata Dal, their 
number will be about one-third of the party. The other 
obstruction Janata Dal leaders' making a final decision about 
Mulayam Singh Yadav government is that even V.P. Singh himself 
is said to be in support of making Mulayam Singh stronger. Some 
other members believe that the 10 legislators who deserted the 
Janta Dal had his blessings. 
  The disintegration of the Janata Dal is believed to be a 
foregone conclusion. The legislators who have joined Mulayam 
Singh were believed to be ready to go there from the very 
beginning. It was Mulayam Singh who was waiting for the right 
time for this division to occur. One reason for this wait was he 
did not want to help the legislators who were waiting to form 
one-third [of legislators] so they could jump to the Congress 
party. However, seeing the attitude of the Bahujan Samaj Party 
and then of the Congress Party recently, he felt that his 
government was in a precarious situation and he could be forced 
to have new elections any time. Mulayam Singh, on getting this 
feeling, started to strengthen his position among the 
Samajwadis, Yadavs, and Muslims. To this end, the first division 
was created in the Communist Party of India followed by the 
division in the Janata Dal. The leaders frustrated with Mulayam 
Singh's strategy have accused him of trying to steal some 
Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress Party legislators also. 
However, this is neither possible nor practical. First, because 
it will not be possible for him to convince one-third of the 
legislators to defect. Second, Mulayam Singh's government cannot 
survive even one day by making either the Bahujan Samaj Party or 
the Congress Party angry.

<F P=106> [Article by Hemant Sharma: "The U.P. Government's Future is </F>
in Question due to the Split Between SP-BSP"] 
  [Text] Lucknow, 11 March. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and 
the Samajwadi Party (SP) in Uttar Pradesh [U.P.] are drifting 
apart. The BSP leaders are openly criticizing the state 
government and their relationship is turning sour. The fate of 
the government could be in jeopardy because of the difference 
between the political cultures of the two parties. 
  The increasing bitterness between the SP and BSP ministers 
and legislators is evident in the U.P. Vidhan Sabha. The 
problems of the three-months-old government have increased 
because of the tension between BSP leaders Kanshi Ram and SP 
leader Mulayam Singh Yadav. Every few minutes, either Kanshi Ram 
or Mayavati is taking the government to task. Chief Minister 
Mulayam Singh, contrary to his nature, is forced to accept these 
insults quietly. 
  Kanshi Ram's threat that he "will not hesitate in dismissing 
this government if it does not work according to [his] 
conditions," has angered the SP leadership. The fact is that the 
main problem for the SP-BSP coalition has been that there never 
was any atmosphere of cooperation among the SP and BSP ministers 
and legislators, although the leaders of the two parties may had 
some understanding. The statement issued by Mayavati, the BSP 
general secretary, proves this. Even SP leaders believe that 
Kanshi Ram's saying that the ministers from his party are 
treated like peons and Mayavati's argument that their 
legislators are not listened to are not considered to be 
sentiments that will go away. Kanshi Ram had aggravated this 
tension between the parties by telling his legislators and 
workers to agitate against the officials and ministers who do 
not listen to them. He told them to make public statements to 
this effect and bring the issue to the people. 
  This tension between the two parties has made the government 
look pitiable in the Vidhan Sabha and the Vidhan Parishad. On 1 
March, when Balram Yadav, a SP cabinet member, announced in the 
Vidhan Sabha that there was plenty of sugar and kerosene oil 
available in the state and that their prices were under control, 
it was Rajbali Yadav, a BSP member, and not the opposition, that 
screamed, "The minister is lying. Kerosene oil is being sold at 
18 rupees a liter in the state." 
  This attitude of the BSP legislators and cabinet members is 
lessening the feeling of joint responsibility. On 4 March, the 
state education minister, Dr. Massaud Ahmed (BSP), and 
Shardanand Anchal, the deputy minister in his own department 
(SP), continued to contradict each other. Similar situations 
took place several times during the current session. When Babu 
Ram Verma (BSP) made an objectionable statement against Pandit 
Govind Ballabh Pant in the vidhan sabha, Chief Minister Mulayam 
Singh apologized immediately and insisted to the chair to remove 
that comment from the vidhan sabha proceedings. The BSP did not 
like it. The BSP leader Mayavati condemned the chief minister's 
action. She told the reporters, "Our legislator was correct. He 
was subjected to unnecessary pressure to apologize. Our 
legislators will not apologize in the future." 
  The BSP is acting like an opposition party because it is not 
being heard and is deprived of power despite its being in the 
government. To protest against the beating of its members while 
they were returning from Calcutta after participating in a rally 
there, the party legislators stopped several trains bound for 
West Bengal. After the caste-related confrontation in Jaunpur, 
the BSP took the city under its control for three days. 
  The BSP leaders and workers also complain that only the SP 
leaders have the privileges associated with being in government. 
A SP worker was wounded in an attack in Gonda, and he was 
transported to a hospital in a helicopter. However, when 
Ramanchal Rajbhar, a BSP legislator, was beaten by the police in 
Akbarpur, the government did not take any action. He was 
transported from Akbarpur to Lucknow in a car. He was in very 
serious condition. 
  The problem for the SP is that Mayavati of the BSP visits 
Lucknow every other week and, under the pretext of looking at 
the working of the government, makes some statements to put the 
government in a difficult position. The problems of the 
government increase and the discipline within the party and the 
government is adversely affected. Mayavati made major problems 
for the government by spewing poison against Mahatma Gandhi. The 
Congress (I) has decided to make this an issue. Mulayam Singh is 
neither owning up to nor giving up this issue. The comments made 
on Mahatma Gandhi and Pant have put the whole government on 
trial. 
  Kanshi Ram and Mayavati's belligerent attitude towards 
Mulayam Singh started because of the daily complaints made by 
BSP ministers and legislators. The BSP ministers, Education 
Minister Dr. Massaud Ahmed, Social Welfare Minister Raj Bahadur, 
and Revenue Minister Vishwambhar Prasad Nishad, told their boss 
(Kanshi Ram) about their helplessness before the BSP-SP rally in 
Allahabad on 5 March. they said that they have to face a lot of 
embarrassment in their ministries because of their inability to 
do any work at government level. These ministers also raised the 
issue of one of their party leader's assassination in Karbi. 
They said that the district administration was apathetic in 
apprehending the criminals. They said that they had sent a 
written complain to the chief minister, but he had not taken any 
action. Kansi Ram became angry. He took the government to task 
in the very first SP-BSP rally. He Said, "My ministers are 
treated like peons. Mr. Chief Minister, this just will not work." 
  Sone Lal Patel, the general secretary of the BSP, said that 
the government officials did not follow up on even the written 
orders of the BSP ministers. If pressured, they say that the 
chief minister had told them not to do that. If the government 
officials do not obey the ministers, what will happen to the 
common workers? A fuming Kanshi Ram said, "If Mulayam Singh has 
the command over the government, I have the command over Mulayam 
Singh. if someone does not listen to you, let me know." The 
warning by Kanshi Ram to uproot this government given in this 
rally was also the result of this anger. 
  The tension between the SP and the BSP is also caused by 
their social bases. The caste-related confrontations that took 
place in Kanpur and Varanasi had resulted from the differences 
between the SP and the BSP. In most cases, Yadavs and Kurmis 
were agitating against the Harijans. In such a situation, the 
government acts to help the party in power [SP]. This is the 
reason why officials do not obey and the government has become 
helplessness. The tensions have risen from the village and 
community level to enter the government.

  [Text] New Delhi, 15 March. The criticism by Kanshi Ram and 
Mayavati of the SP-BSP [Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party] 
coalition government in Uttar Pradesh hints toward the future 
strategy of the BSP. The BSP does not appear to be willing to 
play the political game with the SP in Uttar Pradesh for long. 
Kanshi Ram and Mayavati appear to have already started to write 
an introduction to their separate political existence. However, 
Kanshi Ram is not ready to uproot the present U.P. government 
yet. He did make a public announcement to this affect. It is 
assumed that the BSP will continue to support the government 
because it has its own vested interests there along with Mulayam 
Singh. It is important for this party to remain in the 
government in order to establish a basic structure for ruling 
the state. Kanshi Ram is well aware of this practical fact. 
Kanshi Ram is already rallying popular support by his and his 
supporters' sharp criticism [of the government]. He will 
announce his separate political stand at the right time while 
all this is going on. He wants to stay in the government and 
create an atmosphere in which he can point to his criticism as a 
proof that he had given enough time to Mulayam Singh to improve. 
Mulayam Singh having failed to meet the criteria, however, he 
(Kanshi Ram) was forced to make this decision. 
  Kanshi Ram's whole political strategy is based on this kind 
of politics now. He is preparing for the future. Under this 
plan, some times he talks about evaluating Mulayam Singh's 
government in about six months and other times he talks about 
dislodging it. 
  During this period, Kanshi Ram wants to establish his new 
image. This image will portray him as not willing to compromise 
when the interests of the Dalits are at stake. So much so that 
he would not compromise even with the government in which he is 
a partner. Mayavati's criticism of Gandhi is the climactic point 
of this effort. The BSP wants to demonstrate that it does not 
think much of Gandhi as compared to Ambedekar. 
  The BSP has assumed that if it succeeds in keeping the sword 
of its politics sharp, it will be able to establish its 
government in Uttar Pradesh by itself whenever the next vidhan 
sabha elections are held. Kanshi Ram and his supporters are 
working based on this assumption. Keeping this in mind, he is 
more or less acting like the opposition leader even though he is 
in the government. 
  Kanshi Ram has another target. He is hoping that if the 
Congress Party, which has supported the state government, is 
forced to take back its support because of the BSP criticism, 
then it would prove to be politically beneficial to the BSP. 
However, the Congress Party has also started its preparations 
perceiving the imminent political changes. It has started a 
regular campaign against the BSP so that it does not face 
problems in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by P. Venugopal: "Kanshi Ram is a Step Ahead of </F>
Mayavati"; all quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Kochi, 30 March. Kanshi Ram, the BSP president, has 
supported party General Secretary Mayavati's criticism of 
Mahatma Gandhi. He has went one step ahead and accused the 
Father of the Nation of not being the benefactor of the 
untouchables, and being a supporter of a "very shrewd caste 
system." During his interview with The JANSATTA on Wednesday, he 
also accused Gandhi of being against scheduled caste leaders' 
entering temples. 
  The BSP president said, "Mr. Gandhi did not permit E.V. 
Ramaswami Nayaker, then president of Tamilnadu Congress, to 
participate in the Vaikome satyagraha. This forced E.V. 
Ramaswami to resign from his position as the president and leave 
the Congress Party." To show Gandhi's archaic beliefs about 
untouchables, Kanshi Ram referred to Gandhi's talk with a 
Namboodri Brahman of Vaikome temple as written by Mahadev Desai. 
This talk was related to untouchables passing through the 
temple. This talks went like this: 
  [Mr. Gandhi] Is it appropriate to deprive a whole group of 
Hindus of using a public path just because they were born in a 
lower caste, especially when this path is used by non-Hindus 
also?" 
  [Trustee] How can we help them? They are suffering the 
consequence of their Karma. 
  [Mr. Gandhi] There is no doubt about it. They are suffering 
the result of their Karma by being born as untouchables. 
However, why are you increasing their punishment? 
  Kanshi Ram, referring widely to Mr. Gandhi's articles said 
that Mr. Gandhi wanted to maintain a shrewd caste system. He 
especially brought to our attention the following except from 
Mr. Gandhi's comment in the 6 March 1937 issue of The HARIJAN. 
  ``Every person should follow his forefathers' occupation 
under the caste system. A person born in the family of a Bhangi 
[sanitary worker] should earn his living as a Bhangi. He can't 
do anything else...that is what I believe to be Hindu religion." 
  Kanshi Ram said that Mr. Gandhi had insulted the 
untouchables 
by calling them Harijans [God's people]. "There is no respect 
for the word Harijan now. Will Narasimha Rao like it if we call 
him a Harijan?" He asked. He said that after Mayavati's 
controversial statements about Mr. Gandhi, her "price has risen 
from 5,000 rupees to 100,000 rupees in Uttar Pradesh." (Kanshi 
Ram explained that according to a U.P. custom, the people 
contribute a specific amount to their leader after a speech. 
Thus, the amount presented to a leader measures his or her 
popularity.) 
  When asked if it was appropriate for him to speak against 
Mr. 
Gandhi after getting the support of Mr. Gandhi's Congress Party, 
Kanshi Ram emphatically replied, "We did not ask for Congress 
Party to support us. It supported us on its own." Discussing the 
political situation in Uttar Pradesh, Kanshi Ram said, "I have 
asked Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav to show some results 
within six months. Of this time, four months have already 
passed. I hope that he will be able to perform better during the 
remaining months." 
  When asked if he was satisfied with the performance of 
Mulayam Singh's government, especially in the deteriorating law 
and order situation and brutalities on backward group, he said, 
"I do not think Mulayam Singh himself is happy with it." He 
alleged that the Congress Party, the Janata Dal, and the BJP 
have joined forces in Uttar Pradesh to make problems for Mulayam 
Singh's government. 
  Kanshi Ram said about Kerala that his party will focus on 
foundations at present and will not try to form any coalition 
with another party. He flatly said that he has no desire to form 
a coalition with the new party formed by K.R. Gauri who has 
defected from the CPM [Communist party-Marxist], because "She is 
tied to her Marxist philosophy." He added, "Mrs. Gauri has 
formed this new party for her own reasons. There is no ideology 
behind it. If she were not expelled from the CPM, she should 
have remained in it even now." He said, "After she has talked 
with the Social Justice Party that claims to support social 
justice and the Peoples Democratic Party about forming a 
coalition, then we can discuss that."

<F P=106> [Article by Rajendra Dwivedi: "What is the Battle Plan of </F>
BSP Leadership?" 
  [Text] The most discussed subject in political circles 
these days is: What does Kanshi Ram really want? Does he want 
the SP-BSP coalition government to serve its five years in the 
state or does he want to topple Mulayam Singh's government when 
he gets the opportunity and then hold mid-term elections? If we 
pay close attention to Kanshi Ram's speeches, we get the 
impression that he is committed to the government and, at the 
same time, is working against it. The politics of this state 
seems to be trapped in this web. 
  The BSP leaders seem to believe that it was their 
cooperation 
and support that helped make Mulayam Singh the chief minister of 
the state. No one can have any objection to their desire to live 
in this delusion. There are 67 BSP legislators now and [the 
party] is in the third position in the state. If we look at the 
pre-election climate and analyze it , it would not be 
inappropriate to say that while the BJP was trying to get back 
its old seats, the strong support was for Mulayam Singh. He had 
the support of farmers, students, the youth, minorities, and 
even traders. There were two reasons for this. First was 
Mulayam's clear plan. People general believed that there was no 
difference between what he said and what he did. The second was 
that the voters who were disappointed with the BJP saw Mulayam 
Singh as the only alternative. The Congress and Janata Dal 
leaders failed to win people's trust. The BSP already was 
working with the SP. 
  One quality of Mulayam Singh is that when he trusts someone, 
he trust that person fully. He excuses all his crimes. Mulayam 
Singh also recognizes favors done for him. Whatever goals the 
BSP had in mind when it cooperated with Mulayam Singh, the 
important thing for Mulayam Singh is that this party helped him 
when he needed strong support. The cooperation between the two 
parties actually started during BJP rule when Kanshi Ram had ran 
for Lok Sabha election from Itarsi, Mulayam Singh's home 
constituency. At that time, observers had said that Mulayam 
Singh had secretly endorsed Kanshi Ram instead of his own 
party's candidate for future political reasons. Kanshi Ram's 
efforts to become a lawmaker finally were successful and he 
began to shine like an important star in the political horizon. 
The SP-BSP coalition was formed later during the governor's rule 
in the state, and Mulayam Singh and Kanshi Ram addressed their 
joint rallies. As said earlier, this time around, Mulayam Singh 
let BSP candidates run from their desired election districts 
that included many areas of northeastern Uttar Pradesh. The SP 
workers and an influential group of backwards worked as hard to 
help BSP candidates win as they did for their own candidates in 
order to get their leader appointed to the highest position in 
the state. Mulayam Singh himself toured the whole state several 
times to glean support. In the end, the SP-BSP coalition won 175 
seas and the BJP won 176 seats in the vidhan sabha. The Janata 
Dal, the Congress Party, and the communists faired very badly. 
  The comments that the BSP leaders and legislators made in 
public soon after the coalition government was formed, suddenly 
heated the political atmosphere in the state. This became a 
cause of concern for Mulayam Singh who favored socialism. 
Finally, Mulayam Singh had to announce in dozens of meetings and 
in the vidhan sabha that he is a socialist and did not support 
caste politics. He said that his goal was always to build the 
society and not break it. He believed in breaking up the caste 
system and building the social structure. He also had to repeat 
again and again that he was not the chief minister of SP-BSP 
coalition but of the 140 million people in the state. He 
believed that his first duty was to get justice for every group 
and would not let unfair treatment to anyone because of his or 
her caste. Mulayam Singh also tried to put salve on the wounds 
of the state's bureaucracy which was disgusted by the statements 
issued by BSP leaders. 
  The political dilemma for Mulayam Singh is that he is not in 
a position to say anything openly. He also tries to admonish BSP 
legislators and cabinet members as a good friend. At times, he 
becomes a prey of these legislators' mistakes. One such mistake 
was made by V.R. Verma when he presented the thank-you 
resolution at the end of the governor's speech. He made a 
comment on Govind Ballabh Pant, the first chief minister of the 
state and great freedom fighter. Actually this comment was not 
his own; it was a statement made by Dr. Ambedekar. 
  This was what happened in the House. Outside the House, Ms. 
Mayavati, the national general secretary of the BSP, used the 
kind of language while talking to newsmen in Lucknow that not 
only hurt the feelings of the Congress Party but of the whole 
nation. She called Mahatma Gandhi, whom the people call Bapu 
[father] with love and devotion and whose love for scheduled 
castes and tribes is known to all, the greatest enemy of this 
group. Mayavati said that Mahatma Gandhi had insulted this group 
by giving them the name of Harijan and tried to undermine this 
group. She gave a strange reasoning in this context and asked if 
Gandhi liked the word Harijan so much then why did not he add 
the word Harijan to his name. She said that time was not far 
when Gandhism in this country will be replaced with 
"Ambedakarism." 
  Mayavati, just like her leader Kanshi Ram, attacked the 
state 
government in which her own party is also involved. She alleged 
that the BSP cabinet members were not allowed to function 
independently. What is more, she said, the minister did not have 
the authority to replace the officials in their departments. She 
also said that the chief minister must change his habit of 
forcing SP ministers on the BSP ministers. Mayavati said that 
most of her and Kanshi Ram's time is wasted listening to 
complaints made by the BSP legislators, ministers, and workers 
while the goal for the BSP is not just to have a government in 
this state but take control of the whole nation. At the same 
time, Mayavati also says that she is satisfied with the chief 
minister's work! 
  Mayavati's above statement perhaps is influenced by her 
leader Kanshi Ram's speech given in Allahabad. Kanshi Ram had 
openly expressed his anger at Mulayam Singh in his speech in 
Allahabad on 5 March. He said that the chief minister did not 
pay any head to the BSP ministers and legislators. This had made 
the position of BSP ministers lower than the office peons (the 
BSP has no responsibility). Kanshi Ram openly said that if the 
promises that were made at the time of SP-BSP coalition were not 
followed up then this government will be uprooted. He said that 
he was not a follower of such a government. Perhaps, Mayavati 
had kept this in mind and told the newsmen that if Mulayam Singh 
did not change his attitude, it will not take much time to 
implement what Kanshi Ram had said in Allahabad. 
  The BSP leaders say two different things in the same breath. 
They criticize Mulayam Singh's style of administration and also 
express satisfaction at his achievements. Kanshi Ram also says 
that he will not let the Mulayam Singh government fall and that 
the coalition government will rule for full five years of its 
term. The most interesting aspect of this is that Mulayam Singh 
was present on the stage when Kanshi Ram had made that 
announcement in Allahabad. 
  The BSP people have a thick bundle of complaints against 
Mulayam Singh. They say that the BSP minister given district 
responsibilities have only one or two districts under them 
compared to five or six districts given to the SP ministers. The 
officials do not give as much serious attention to the BSP 
ministers as do they to the SP minister. They also say that the 
BSP ministers of state that are working with the SP cabinet 
level ministers have been given tasks that are done by deputy 
ministers. 
  The BSP believes that the Yadav caste has control over the 
backward votes, and the number of Kurmi voters is only slightly 
less then the Yadavs. Therefore, the BSP is looking at the 
voters in this group. Perhaps, that is why the BSP has appointed 
Kurmi caste persons to the positions of state general secretary 
and the legislative group leadership. The president of the BSP 
is Jang Bahadur Patel, its general secretary is Sonelal Patel, 
and the leader of the legislative group os Ramlakhan Verma. The 
Kurmi conferences have been held in Bareilly, Benares, and 
Sonbhadar districts. The BSP is planning similar conferences in 
other districts also. 
  It is not that Chief Minister Mulayam Singh is unaware of 
all 
these developments. He has given the responsibility to lure the 
Kurmi voters and officials to Beni Prasad Verma, the legislative 
program minister. 
  Another BSP action has become a subject of discussions in 
political circles. This action is related to criticism of top 
Congress Party leadership. This is not limited to former 
leaders; present leaders are also included in it. They have been 
attacking Prime Minister Narasimha Rao from the very beginning. 
It is a known fact that Congress legislators support the 
government and defend it from the sharp attacks by the BJP. 
Mayavati attacked Pramod Tiwari, the leader of this group, very 
strongly. This is neither timely nor an appropriate strategy for 
the coalition government that has the majority in the House 
because of the support from the Congress Party and the Janata 
Dal. It is especially wrong at a time when the budget session is 
in progress and the government had to struggle during each 
budget hearing. 
  We will see now what kind of shrewdness Mulayam Singh 
demonstrates in keeping the Congress Party with him. At the same 
time, the chief minister has to satisfy the BSP leaders, 
ministers, and legislators.

<F P=106> [Article by Ashis Ghosh: "Caste Versus Class: Leftists </F>
Groping for a Response"; all quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Now, finally, the communists have to stand up 
against the powerful casteist wave sweeping through the Hindi 
belt. 
  Over the last two or three years, Marxists have dismissed 
the 
casteist challenge in Uttar Pradesh [U.P.] and Bihar as 
class-based struggle. In light of India's history, which is more 
applicable; class struggle or struggle for social justice? The 
true nature of the communist-socialist struggle [in India] is 
before us now. What will it be, caste or class? What will 
laborers base their struggle on? Communists have rested content 
that this question has been answered. Now they have had to come 
back down onto the Maidan [open space in Calcutta where 
processions are held] to deal with this dispute all over again. 
Leftist theorists are going back to analysis and ledgers. They 
are shaking the dust off of the books of Ram Manohar Lohiya 
[communist intellectual]. 
  Along with the casteist politics brought to U.P. by Kansi 
Ram, Bihar's caste-based politics is also experiencing a wave. 
There are indications of a joining of forces of Dalits and OBC's 
[other backward castes]. The Yadavs have been holding 
gatherings; also, the Vaishyas and Kurmis. The Telis, Dangis, 
Rajputs, Chandras, Chamars, and Chaursiyas are about to do the 
same. All in the name of caste! Now the Brahmins and Bhumihars 
are beginning to organize. Leaders, both government and private 
are attending these gatherings. These are not really political 
gatherings but caste assemblages! The recent Kurmi assemblage in 
Patna was very impressive and turned everyone's head. It was not 
just a show either. Here BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], JD 
[Janata Dal], Congress (I) and CPI [Communist Party-India] 
leaders joined together, showing the force of the wind blowing 
through northern India. 
  By attempting to swim against the casteism current, Marxists 
are getting winded, just like BJP. They are both bewildered. 
Recent political developments have served to remind Hindutva 
advocates that there is no one basis or point on which to unite 
Hindu society. BJP has had to deemphasize Ayodhya in Bihar as 
they do not want to be known as a Brahmin or high-caste party. 
In order to attract Dalit and Tribal votes, BJP has begun to 
organize Raths [processions] based on their respective 
traditions but without much success. The party is not too 
optimistic over the Sita Ram Keshari case decided in the Supreme 
Court. 
  Even if communist leaders are divided over the Mandal 
Commission, they have accepted the U.P. vote as an awakening of 
the Dalits. In a short time, two things have taken place; an 
escalating rivalry between the Dalits and higher castes 
(including OBC's) and Kansi Ram's jihad against communists. His 
speeches are not mere rustic rhetoric either. The communists 
have been hostile towards social justice for a long time. A long 
time ago Lohiya wrote: "Let no one think that it is a matter of 
fighting the higher castes. In class struggle, when the 
capitalist system falls, caste problems will automatically 
disappear. The curse of the caste system is sustained by 
capitalism and class differences. Those who regard class 
struggle as inevitable and strive for a classless society have 
no regard for a caste-based society that thrives on differences." 
  Caste or class; this old socialist-communist dilemma has 
been 
stirred up again by Mulayam Singh, Kansi Ram, and Lalu Yadav. 
Their cry for ``Social Justice'' has gradually spread over 
northern India. It will undoubtedly be an important issue in the 
next few elections. Economic issues have been downgraded in this 
call for social justice. Leftists are seeing whether or not 
these two issues can be combined. Senior CPI leader Chaturanan 
Mishra confessed, "We refuse to answer this question. Communists 
do not understand the necessity for agitation by lower castes." 
CPM [Communist Party India-Marxist] leader Ganesh Sjankar 
Vidyarthi also confessed, "Caste conflict has put our party in a 
difficult position." CPI-ML [Communist Party-India 
Marxist-Leninist] recently held a gathering in Patna called 
``Social Change''. CPI General Secretary Indrajit Gupta 
confessed: "Just concentrating on class conflict will get us 
nowhere. We need to focus on caste conflict." 
  The fall of the Soviet Union and China's about face 
[economically] has forced India's communists to look within. 
Domestically, while BJP's communal wave has subsided, the caste 
wave is still rising. Communists are being forced to contemplate 
the relevance of Marxist theory. CPI recently held a work 
retreat in Hyderabad in which the focus was ``Caste's internal 
workings and the question of social justice in India.'' A study 
paper was published from this in which the folowing statement is 
found: ``Caste-based politics began to escalate in the 1980's 
due to lack of economic progress. Leftists have neglected social 
and cultural issues. This is why caste politics have taken on a 
social theme.'' The leftists, while doing some soul 
searching, are still clinging to class struggle as the ultimate 
explanation. They want to change caste-based politics into 
class-based politics. Leftists are, of course, vey weak in 
Hindi-speaking areas. Naxal leader Vinod Mishra fears this 
declining influence and hopes to quickly break Dalit enchantment 
with Kansi Ram: "In Varanasi, Yadavs have clashed with Harijans 
and this will shake up BSP. Kansi Ram cannot solve problems 
between backward castes and Harijans." Mishra feels unsure, 
however, whether disillusionment with Kansi Ram will send 
Harijans toward the leftists camp or toward BJP! 
  Two years ago, leftists united in Bihar in a land seizure 
and 
redistribution campaign. This desperate attempt to instigate 
class struggle and elevate it over caste struggle was 
directionless and leaders were divided on strategy. Lalu Prasad 
refused to join hands with leftists despite threats and bribes. 
Instead, his party often took the side of landowners. Kansi Ram 
refused to go to Harijan slums. In fact, Harijans did not get 
tickets to run for SP or BSP; businessmen did. All of these 
facts challenge leftist class assertions. They are not very 
strong in Hindi-speaking areas anyway. The new circumstances are 
causing them to resort to soul searching. Will the communists in 
India finally have to admit defeat?

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 8--The Centre today decided to 
suspend exports of cotton with immediate effect in view of the 
continuing rise in prices despite adequate availability in the 
domestic market. Consequently, the exports of two lakh bales, 
for which contracts had been finalised, would not be allowed 
now. Earlier, the Government had stopped the exports of 1.3 lakh 
bales which had been released for export, but for which 
contracts had not been finalised. 
  Secondly, a credit squeeze is being planned by the Reserve 
Bank. It might order that no further advance be made against 
cotton stocks to traders and that those made earlier this year 
be recalled to make the trade sell the stock it holds. A final 
decision is yet to be taken. 
  The Government may also make it obligatory for manufacturers 
of cotton yarn to blend with it a minimum of 10 per cent viscose 
staple fibre. This is expected to depress the demand for cotton 
somewhat. There is also a move to make suitable adjustment in 
the excise and import duties on viscose staple fibre to make it 
available at a price comparable to that prevailing for cotton. 
  Besides, the Government has told mill owners that export of 
hank yarn too would be suspended if its prices were increased. 
All exporters of cotton yarn under the Advance Licencing Scheme 
may also be asked to import cotton first instead of doing so 
after the export of yarn. This would ensure that there were no 
exports without corresponding prior import of cotton. 
  The cotton control order is also being amended to enable the 
Textile Commissioner to impose stock limits on traders and 
ginners (including co-operative federations) and to inspect 
their premises for enforcement of the order. States are being 
urged to take immediate action against hoarders of cotton under 
the Essential Commodities Act and ensure adequate availability 
of hank yarn to weavers at reasonable prices. Cooperative 
federations are being told to accelerate the deliveries of 
cotton against the quantities sold and to desist from 
arbitrarily raising prices. 
  These decisions were taken at a meeting convened here by the 
Textiles Minister, Mr. G. Venkat Swamy, to review the cotton 
situation. It was noted at the meeting that the upward trend in 
prices of cotton had been continuing since mid-January, when the 
situation was reviewed last. This though various measures were 
taken to check prices, including the announcement that five lakh 
bales of cotton would be imported duty free. it was also felt 
that there was no real shortage of cotton in the current year 
with the crop estimated to be at least 125 lakh bales, though 
against the initial estimate was 135 lakh bales. 
  The total availability, taking into account the carry-over 
stock of 31 lakh bales and the import of about one lakh bales 
under the Advance Licencing Scheme, would be 157 lakh bales. 
This should leave a balance of 30 lakh bales after meeting the 
domestic requirement.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Principled Stand"] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asaf Ahmed Ali, Foreign 
Secretary Shaharyar Khan, and the Pakistan ambassador to the 
United States Maliha Lodhi met with Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto in Prime Minister's house on Tuesday and exchanged views 
on Pakistan-United States relations. The prime minister said 
that using the Pressler amendment to stop aid to Pakistan is an 
extreme action. Pakistan is opposed to this unfair action as 
this amendment should have been imposed upon India also. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has taken a principled stand. 
The allegations on which the aid to Pakistan was stopped were 
totally false. This was done just because of the Indian 
propaganda. The United States used it to deprive Pakistan of aid 
and loans. The greatest accusation against Pakistan was that it 
was involved in making nuclear weapons. However, it is clear now 
that Pakistan never had such a program. Pakistan had started the 
nuclear program to control the energy crisis, and this program 
has been frozen for several years. Meanwhile, India is making 
gradual progress in its nuclear program. It is involved in 
making missiles that can reach their targets thousands of miles 
away. It has increased the national defense budget by 20 percent 
to increase its military strength. However, the United States is 
not willing to impose any kind of restriction against it, and 
has given it full freedom to become the supreme power in this 
region. The second serious allegation against Pakistan is about 
providing aid to the Sikhs involved in the Khalistan movement in 
East Punjab. Threats to declare Pakistan a terrorist nation were 
being made under this allegation. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, however, has unmasked these 
false accusations levied by India and the United States in a 
television interview with the BBC. Madam Bhutto's interview 
revealed that she had helped late Rajiv Gandhi control the Sikh 
movement in Punjab during her previous government. Had Pakistan 
not helped at that time, God knows where India would be now. 
Still, such is India's ungratefulness that it is bent upon 
condemning and hurting Pakistan. 
  The truth is that India just cannot tolerate Pakistan's 
existence, and the United States because of the Indian 
propaganda is also bent upon annoying Pakistan. The U.S. 
approach is totally wrong and prejudiced. There is no reason for 
stopping aid to Pakistan using the Pressler amendment. If the 
United States remains adamant then we should understand that it 
is blackmailing Pakistan and wants to use it as a pawn in its 
international political chess game. However, it is a mistake and 
as this blackmail will not last long. Pakistan can survive and 
make progress without the U.S. aid. However, this is possible 
only if the pride of our nation is protected by a sincere, 
courageous and self-respecting leader.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Dispute Over F-16's Lease"] </F>
  [Text] The Pakistani government's decision not to give 
additional money before the F-16 planes are delivered is a step 
in the right direction. The company the government is dealing 
with has not responded to a letter requesting it to transfer the 
F-16 airplanes immediately to Pakistan as per the agreement. 
Pakistan has already paid the huge amount of $680 million to 
this company, and this company has demanded payment of another 
$150 million before March 1994. Pakistan, however, has taken the 
correct stand that the airplanes should be sent to Pakistan as 
per the agreement before the next installment is paid. The 
delivery of F-16 planes to Pakistan was stopped under the 
Pressler amendment using Pakistan's peaceful nuclear program as 
an excuse. It is unfortunate that the agreement to purchase 
F-16s was made in 1989 and the Pressler amendment was passed in 
1990. On principle, an agreement made before the Pressler 
amendment should not be affected by it. However, as the result 
of the U.S. government's unfair and unprincipled stand, economic 
and military aid to Pakistan was suspended using the nuclear 
program as leverage to put pressure on Pakistan. This issue 
could not be resolved despite several high-level talks. The 
question arises, how long can Pakistan tolerate the situation 
where it has paid for, but cannot get the airplanes? At the same 
time, we are being asked to pay the other installments for the 
planes. The Pakistani government should raise this issue at all 
political and diplomatic levels with the U.S. government. It 
should also take legal action in U.S. courts so that either the 
money paid in advance is returned or the F-16 planes are 
supplied to Pakistan.

  [Text] The activities of some U.S. soldiers participating 
in the Pakistan-U.S. joint military exercises appear to be 
secretive and suspicious. These include Jewish commandos who 
disappear for hours during these exercises and conduct surveys 
by going to Pakistan's nuclear center in Kahuta. It is 
surprising how these Jewish commandos manage to enter Kahuta 
where even a bird is not allowed to fly over. No one is there to 
stop them. This makes us suspect that the government has decided 
to roll back its nuclear program and is not worried about it 
now. Mr. Nawaz Sharif as the opposition leader should also raise 
his voice against these mysterious activities of the U.S. 
commandos. However, he is silent. The nation would not have 
learned about it if Qazi Hussain Ahmed, the newly elected leader 
of Jamat-i Islami, had not revealed this information.

<F P=106> [Article by Kalim Akhtar: "Is China a Partner on the Kashmir </F>
Issue?"] 
  [Text] China has interests related to the hilly region 
around Kashmir. The military and geographical interest is very 
clear. The Kashmir region joins three countries 
geographically--Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China [as published]. 
The only surface route between China and Pakistan is the 
Karakoram highway which passes through the Northern Areas. This 
highway was inaugurated in 1978. This is the only route for 
China to access the Arabian Sea. China has built another road 
which joins Xinkiang with the western part of Tibet. This road 
passes the uninhabited region of Aksai Chin which is in the 
northeast of Ladakh. Although India still claims ownership of 
Aksai Chin, this has become a part of China and is very 
important for it from a military perspective because this is the 
only route between two Chinese provinces. 
  This rough but unbelievably beautiful region is very 
important for China and Pakistan for military reasons. China and 
Pakistan will have to depend on the Karakoram highway if there 
is a war with India to keep lines of communications and 
transportation between the two countries open. God forbid, but 
if the whole state of Jammu-Kashmir (which according to the 
United Nations includes the Northern Areas) is put under UN 
administration, this very important connection between China and 
Pakistan will be lost. Neither country would tolerate such a 
situation. 
  Historically, Gilgit, Nanada, and the Northern Areas 
including Jammu and Kashmir were considered very important areas 
between British India and China. The Nanda mountains is 
especially important for several reasons. In the 18th century, 
Nihatra had recognized Xinkiang as a tax-collecting power. They 
paid 15 ounces of gold dust annually to Xinkiang. In exchange 
they were permitted to use the grazing grounds in the Pamirs and 
Sikkim. There was no clear and permanent border with Xinkiang. 
This had become a tributary of Kashmir in the 19th century. 
Later, the maps of the British era show it as part of the Indian 
Subcontinent. 
  China is very interested in the Kashmir issue both from 
geographic and military viewpoints. It appears to be very active 
in at least two areas--Pakistan-China border issue and the Aksai 
Chin issue. The first situation was created by the 1963 
Pakistan-China border agreement. The document of the agreement 
was ready by February 1963 and it was formally signed in Beijing 
on 2 March 1963. At that time, China's borders around Gilgit and 
Balistan were not settled. One year before May 1962 when the 
Chinese government started serious discussions over the border 
with Pakistan, the tension between China and the Soviet Union 
had already increased. At that time it seemed that Gilgit was a 
point of contention between China and the Soviet Union. One 
Indian journalist had written about it in 1964. 
  Control of the whole area from Gilgit to the Pamirs could 
have proved dangerous to the Soviet Central Asia. Therefore, 
military interests forced the Soviet Union to support India on 
the Kashmir issue in order to keep its control on Gilgit. That 
way the United States could not establish a base against the 
Soviet Union there. 
  When discussions to determine the border between China and 
Pakistan started, an area covering 3400 square miles was 
undecided. China, however, showed unusual flexibility and 
generosity and Pakistan got 1350 square miles in the final 
decision which included 750 square miles of area under Chinese 
control. This agreement gave China 2050 square miles area which 
was already under its control. In addition, three-fourths of the 
Godon and Sainka hills area known as K-2 came under Pakistan's 
control. India was extremely furious at this agreement. It said 
that Pakistan has no right to such an agreement as this area is 
part of Jammu and Kashmir state and Jammu and Kashmir is an 
integral part of India. India also accused Pakistan of illegally 
occupying the Northern Areas. However, it has been made clear in 
Article 6 of the Pakistan-China agreement that the disputed 
character of Jammu and Kashmir should be kept in mind. This is 
the most important article of the agreement because this means 
that China must be involved in any future discussions about 
Jammu and Kashmir. China cannot be kept out. Article 6 of the 
agreement states: "Both countries agree that after the dispute 
between India and Pakistan is settled over Kashmir, the ruler of 
this region will hold talks all over again with the government 
of China and a new agreement will replace this agreement." 
China's direct interest in what is happening in Jammu and 
Kashmir is natural. The great interest of the United States 
(from behind the UN facade) in Jammu and Kashmir region is 
enough to make the Beijing government become alert and cautious. 
The Western power thinks that China is moving very cunningly 
when asking for new talks over the borders. Similarly, India and 
China's dispute over Aksai Chin is also the cause of a great 
interest for China in the Kashmir issue. Aksai Chin is a desert 
and an unpopulated region in the northeast region of Ladakh. At 
present it is under China's control. Its importance has 
increased because China has built a road in this area which 
unites its two border provinces--Xinkiang and Tibet. India still 
is adamant that Aksai Chin is a part of Jammu and Kashmir state. 
The British government in India had sent a proposal to Peking on 
14 November 1899. In this note of 1899, the British Prime 
Minister Sir Claude McDonald had said that the British 
government of India suggests that keeping in mind the 
forthcoming problems and uncertainties about the future, the 
British government desires decisions about the border between 
China and the British India. Thus, the 1899 note means that 
Aksai Chin region was accepted as part of China. Some changes 
occurred in 1905, however. The Aksai Chin region remained within 
China's Xinkiang province. In 1914, the British government 
included Aksai Chin in Tibetan maps very quietly. A conference 
was held in October 1913 between British India and China in 
Shimla. In this conference, the British government very cleverly 
expanded the western border of Tibet to prove that Aksai Chin 
was a part of Tibet. This was done to include Aksai Chin into 
British India at the right time. However, the Shimla conference 
failed and the map that was included in this conference does not 
now have any official status. Independent India all of a sudden 
showed Aksai Chin region part of India in its maps in 1954. Thus 
this record was prepared to prove that Aksai Chin was also an 
integral part of India. Then prime minister of India, the late 
Nehru, wrote to the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to claim India's 
ownership of Aksai Chin while erroneously referring to the 1899 
agreement. 
  China, however, had completed a road between Xinkiang and 
Tibet in 1950. This road passed through Aksai Chin. India could 
not do anything about it except to make the whole affair more 
complicated. The Survey of India agency published maps of 
Jammu-Kashmir in 1952 to present them in the United Nations as 
the Kashmir issue was introduced in the United Nations at that 
time. These maps showed the Aksai Chin region as part of 
Jammu-Kashmir so that this become a part of the UN proceedings. 
This affair is still going on and the Aksai Chin affair is still 
there. Whenever the Kashmir issue is discussed in the United 
Nations, the important issue of Aksai Chin will also emerge 
because it is there on the Indian maps. At that time, China had 
to oppose it and become a party to this debate. India now claims 
that China is occupying 12000 square miles of its territory. 
This includes Aksai Chin and the areas that were given to 
Pakistan in the 1961 Pakistan-China agreement. 
  This situation is very interesting to our American friends, 
and unfortunately this is giving them plenty of material to 
start mischief. However, Pakistan is not unaware of this 
situation. China and Pakistan have a great responsibility for 
the people of Kashmir. Both countries have always supported the 
right of Kashmiri people for self-determination. The Security 
Council resolutions are for resolving the Kashmir issue. 
However, India is not moving even an inch, and had adopted an 
aggressive and belligerent attitude. This has endangered peace 
in this region. India and Pakistan have almost started a war in 
Siachen glacier region. India is spending billions of rupees 
daily in that place. That is why India wants to resolve the 
Siachen glacier issue separately in order to reduce its expenses 
there. This issue is related to Kashmir. India had crossed the 
Line of Control in 1984 and had thus torn the Shimla Agreement 
to shreds. Therefore, this issue cannot be discussed separately 
with India. As for the border dispute between China and India, 
we have already given details about it. The truth is that any 
region around Jammu and Kashmir cannot be given to any country 
until the Kashmir issue is resolved. The government of Pakistan 
should take China into confidence and and tell the international 
community that this state cannot be divided since it is waiting 
for a resolution in the Security Council. In our opinion, this 
is a very important point and deserves immediate 
attention.

<F P=106> [Article by Gen. Hamid Gul: "Kashmir Is the Main Reason for </F>
the Pakistan Army"] 
  [Text] When the independence movement started in Kashmir in 
1990, India was not aware of its intensity, breadth, and depth. 
It did not have any idea about how it was going to spread and 
how strong it was going to become. Therefore, as the intensity 
of this movement began to surface, the daze felt by the Indian 
government and its various agencies began to show. We wanted to 
let India know that we are not only able to defend ourselves but 
also are able to take the war inside the enemy's territory. 
Thus, India has begun to understand that Pakistan wanted to 
resolve the Kashmir issue by the strength of its arms. Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto visited Muzaffarabad during those days 
and expressed her support for Kashmir's freedom struggle. She 
even said that her blood was going to join with the blood of 
Kashmiri people. The Indian policy-makers concluded that the 
government of Pakistan was ready to make a firm effort. 
  Robert Gates, director of the CIA, visited India and 
Pakistan 
during this time. He said that clouds of war were hovering here 
and there was the danger of a nuclear war. There was not really 
a clear danger of a war at that time, however, the United States 
was afraid that if a war was started and nuclear weapons were 
used, its vision of new world order would get a jolt. If we look 
at the background of these incidents, we have to agree that 1990 
was a very good year for the Kashmir movement. We not only 
showed our strong allegiance to this struggle for freedom, but 
also succeeded in making the Indian government aware of how much 
sacrifice we were willing to make for this goal. The freedom 
fighters were working for the independence movement with full 
ardor, although a large number of them were getting killed. 
Still, the speed of the independence movement was fairly good. 
The most important accomplishment of the movement for 
independence was the destruction of India's communication 
system. Its information and intelligence system was totally 
destroyed, and the government system was forced to cooperate 
with the freedom fighters. 
<H5>  Foreign Pressure and the Nuclear Program </H5>
  The year 1991 did not prove to be better for the 
independence 
movement because a cap was put on our nuclear program. India was 
worried by our nuclear program and its fear was reduced. It is 
obvious that when India learned that Pakistan has stopped work 
on its nuclear program, it started a new strategy. 
  It is proper here to briefly define three terms used in the 
context of the Pakistani nuclear program: 
  A. Freezing--It means keeping the technology related to 
nuclear weapon where it is now and not making any progress. 
  B. Capping --It means stopping enrichment of uranium. 
  C. Roll Back--It means destroying materials already 
prepared and ending the capability to make weapons. 
  Unfortunately, many political circles and persons admitted 
to 
putting a cap on the program. I oppose this as none of these 
political parties had received a mandate from the people. None 
of the parties had this included in their manifestos. Instead, 
all of them had promised protection of the nuclear program in 
their manifestos. However, they did not follow this after they 
got power and have admitted putting a cap on the program 
themselves. Why did they do that? Who gave them this right? If 
they supported democracy then why did they turn away from the 
mandate the people had given them? The people did not give them 
the permission. All of them admitted that they did it under 
foreign pressure. 
  Actually, the international powers had understood that they 
could control the impending war. They put on pressure which was 
accepted. India began to get signals in 1991 that we were not 
ready to go to war over the Kashmir issue. It was communicated 
by various means that Pakistan did not want to take the risk of 
a war over Kashmir. Governments make decision over national 
issues after a lot of thought as to what they should do and what 
they should not. It was not correct to give India the indication 
that we could not go to war. As the result of it, India moved 
its troops from other fronts and sent them to Kashmir. India 
could not have done this from a military perspective. It should 
not have taken a position which is termed as a military 
imbalance. It did that only after it got hints from Pakistan and 
then caused this military imbalance. India was obviously aware 
of our weakness ,that is why it moved 550,000 troops to Kashmir. 
In my opinion this happened because of our weak policy. These 
550,000 troops were brought into the valley against 3.5 million 
people in Kashmir. 
  One other result of our weak policy was that the young men 
who had come to Pakistan in 1990 after listening to Madam 
Benazir Bhutto's speech faced additional problems. The 
government of Pakistan did not provide them full support, and 
this gave them the wrong impression. As the result of this the 
movement did not spread outside the valley or at least did not 
spread as much as it should have. In Jammu, except for in 
Mayurdoda, the movement did not make much progress. The pressure 
that should have been put on India was not there. The people of 
Poonch and other hill regions known for their military character 
did not join the movement. Our flaw was that we could not give a 
full message to Kashmiri people as to what we could do for them 
and how much we could help them. On the other hand, India gave 
them the message in an atrocious manner that no one could 
protect them from the bayonets of its soldiers and that their 
cries could not impress anyone. What affect was there on India 
of our making noise against its atrocities? Four years have 
passed, India has given permission neither to human rights 
organizations nor to Amnesty International to visit Kashmir. It 
did not allow any press reporter, either. Had Pakistan done 
that, it would have been in a major crisis. Still, Pakistan did 
not do anything and it was threatened with being called a 
terrorist state. 
<H5>  False Threats About Labeling Pakistan a Terrorist Nation </H5>
  As for the affair about the threat of being labeled a 
terrorist nation, I have said repeatedly these were fake 
threats. They could never declare us a terrorist nation. First, 
they had to declare the Kashmiri people's freedom fight a 
terrorist action. They cannot do that because the Kashmiri 
freedom struggle is a valid movement from political, moral, and 
legal perspectives. All the laws in the world, and the UN rules 
and regulations declare it a valid freedom struggle. On the 
other hand, it is the Indian government that was involved in 
terrorism. Its armed forces can be called terrorists for their 
actions. 
  The people of Kashmir and the freedom fighters there are 
organizing their movement according to old and new laws in the 
world. They are struggling in their own region in a very civil 
manner. They did not blast any bomb in Indian territory. 
Contrary to it, India is terrorizing them in their own land. The 
people and the freedom fighters are peaceful. Their peacefulness 
is evident by the fact that they do not kidnap the women and 
children of their enemies. They do not burn them alive or 
amputate their hands and feet. In addition, the whole 
nation--the whole population--is with them. Did it ever happen 
that the whole population joined the terrorists? 
  The false threat of terrorism ended. It had to end one day. 
I 
do not know why were we afraid of it? However, we wasted a lot 
of time because of the fear of being labeled a terrorist nation. 
We did not do what we should have because of baseless fears. 
Many important things could not be done. That caused many 
problems and complexities. One of the biggest problem is that 
India, instead of accepting any demand, is once again trying to 
give the impression to the Kashmiri people that neither they nor 
Pakistan will find safety by internationalizing the issue. They 
have to accept Indian rule in the end. Now, India wants them to 
accept its two conditions. First, to accept the Line of Control 
as the border. Second, you will get whatever you ask for if you 
remain within the Indian Union. However, the Kashmiris know that 
India did not fulfill its promises to them in the past. It 
forgot the UN resolutions as well as the promises that it made 
to the Kashmiris under Article 370. It had promised them their 
own prime minister, their own president, and their own flag. It 
tore these promises to shreds. India deceived Sheikh Abdullah 
with promises of friendship and then put him in a jail where he 
wasted many years. It is obvious that Kashmiris cannot trust 
India over anything, and Indian strategy cannot be successful 
now. 
  It is clear that under international pressure India will 
have 
to accept the fact that the Kashmiris will not stay with it any 
longer. Even the secular forces in the West are worried that the 
Kashmir region might become the center of an international 
Islamic struggle, and this dispute over land might change into a 
question of religion. They are especially worried about the 
Afghan Muslims coming this way after taking care of their own 
problems, and the spread of a desire among the Pakistani youth 
to fight for Kashmir. They are worried that the Muslims from all 
over the world might gather in Kashmir. 
  I am sure that the Muslims will come here if we invoke 
jihad. 
If Bin Baz, the chief justice of Saudi Arabia, can issue fatwa 
[edict] against Afghanistan's Rashid Dostam, it is possible that 
seeing the brutalities being committed on Kashmiris, he issues a 
fatwa for jihad here. Then Muslims from all over the world can 
be asked to participate in this jihad. India will be forced to 
accept some of our demands. We have to see what demands it will 
accept. 
<H5>  The Third Option </H5>
  The idea of a third option is being floated around in the 
West. They are saying with great zeal that India also agrees to 
the third option. In my opinion, this third option is premature 
at this time. India has first to accept that Kashmir is a 
disputed region. It is necessary that the Kashmiri people agree 
on one strategy. They must be united on the demand to be free 
from Indian occupation and have an ideal government. When India 
is willing to leave Kashmir, then we can discuss another option. 
In my personal opinion, the people who talk about the third 
option are tearing up the UN resolutions. After it, getting a 
new resolution introduced and passed in the United Nations that 
is according to the wishes of Kashmiri people will be analogous 
to harnessing a lion. We should neither be deceived by the 
tricks played by any superpower, nor should we play any tricks 
ourselves. Those who say that it is important to use the third 
option in order to get Western support are wrong. First, it is 
contrary to Islamic principles to use deceit instead of talking 
openly. Even if we grant that the United States is honest with 
us and will be successful in liberating Kashmir, it still cannot 
be successful is liberating the whole of Kashmir or pressure 
India to do so. 
  The United States can neither do this nor it will want to 
regardless of its personal or strategic interests. The reason is 
that all U.S. policies comply with Israel, and Israel considers 
India its favorite nation. Both these countries have mutual 
defense pacts which include agreement to transfer technology. 
Therefore, Israel considers India a very important country for 
its own goals. 
  If we work on the third option, the most we can achieve is 
freedom of the valley. The region of Jammu that is on this side 
of the Chenab will not be freed. Similarly, the people in Ladakh 
do not agree with the third option. It is not easy for India to 
give independence to Kashmir under the third option because it 
will have to give the option of independence to hundreds of 
states that were included in India according to the partition 
formula. It took over Hyderabad and Junagarh forcibly by 
organized military attacks. Now, if the third option is approved 
then the states that were forcibly included in India cannot be 
stopped from leaving India. The whole formula used for the 
partition will be voided. India will be even more affected by it 
as 15 separatist movements are already going on there. 
<H5>  ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] Meeting Should Be </H5>
Called 
  Now the question is how to rectify the old mistakes and form 
an appropriate policy for the future. What immediate steps 
should be taken to really help the present Kashmir movement? In 
my opinion, the meeting of the ICO should be called immediately. 
This is not just Pakistan's problem; this is an international 
issue. We have seen the role the UN played in Bosnia. The United 
Nations is not able to play a role for the Muslims. It is futile 
to have any hope from the present UN leadership. Therefore, 
looking up to the United Nations would be useless. This will 
give India more time to take atrocious actions against the 
independence movement. 
  Similarly, negotiations under the Shimla Pact have also 
proved useless. The reason is that the Shimla Pact does not 
offer any basis for resolving the Kashmir issue. The pact is 22 
years old and no talks were held on the Kashmir issue under it. 
Instead, this dispute can be resolved only if we hold a 
plebiscite within this framework. However, is the UN Security 
Council willing to take the initiative to hold a plebiscite 
according to its own resolutions? Not at all. Instead, 
Boutros-Ghali is talking about negotiations. The United Nations 
pays his salary to implement those resolutions. Therefore, at 
present the only viable course is to call the meeting of the 
ICO. I say that the United Nations and the Shimla Pact have 
failed in stopping the bloodshed in Kashmir. The emergency 
meeting of the ICO should be of the same nature as the one 
called in Islamabad after the Soviet attack on Afghanistan. The 
United States seems to be changing its thinking and will not 
have any objection to the calling of an ICO meeting. Iran had 
presented a resolution on Afghanistan. It would be better if 
another country proposes a resolution this time again. 
<H5>  Ideological Consensus </H5>
  Factionalism and political unrest in Pakistan can be 
detrimental to the Kashmir movement. It is an encouraging 
development that the whole nation had united on 5 February and 
had told India that we are all united over the Kashmir issue and 
we will not allow India to shed our brothers' blood. However, 
the tug-of-war for power among the political parties again and 
again takes us away from the real issue. It is unfortunate that 
during the recent election, motorways and yellow cabs were made 
important issues, but Kashmir, on which our fate is hanging, was 
not made an election issue by any political party. If the 
present feeling persists among the people, we will keep drifting 
away from Kashmir. At present, it is important to assure all 
Kashmiris that all Pakistani people are with them with all their 
means. 
  It is extremely important for the Kashmiri people to develop 
ideological and philosophical consensus among themselves. They 
should understand it well that whenever any talks are started to 
move away from the UN resolutions, it will lead to the danger of 
division of Kashmir. If India can accept anything, then it is 
the division of Kashmir. As for divisions, India might have to 
implement this idea on itself. There are 160 million Muslims in 
India [as published] and India must give them a separate land 
for them to live on. This will lead to a division like that we 
saw in Yugoslavia and this will not be an ideological issue. 
Then we can ask India: If a few hundred thousand Dogras 
[Pandits] cannot live with the Muslims, how can you expect 160 
million Muslims to live with the Hindus in India? If Hundreds of 
thousands of Hindus can live with dignity in Pakistan, why not 
the Dogras? In my opinion, India will be obliterated one day and 
Kashmir will become independent. When Khalistan is established, 
where will these Dogras go? It will be atrocious if they are cut 
off both from India and Kashmir. They will have no place to go. 
Therefore, the Dogras should take full part in Kashmir's 
struggle for independence. 
  Another question that is raised is: If Kashmir is taken out 
of India following the UN resolutions, what kind of relationship 
will it have with Pakistan? I do not think it is a major issue. 
It would be better if Kashmir makes some agreements with 
Pakistan. These agreements will be useful for Kashmir and enable 
it to benefit from Pakistan. It is in Pakistan's lap 
geographically. I do not think Kashmir should become another 
state in Pakistan. it will not be appropriate. It will not be 
safe from Pakistani administrative drawbacks, and it will not 
have the guarantees to protect its political, geographical, and 
economic identities for which it is fighting the jihad now. 
  The way Pakistani governments have shown their weakness and 
the way its people have shown their apathy have not given 
encouragement to Kashmir's independence movement. We cannot 
praise their courage and forbearance enough as they have kept 
their struggle alive. Still, because of the change in Indian 
military policy, the population in cities is facing innumerable 
problems. The Indian military avenges the attacks on the people 
living in the cities. There is a limit to the patience of these 
people. The freedom fighters have to fight outside the cities 
according to guerilla war rules and make the Indian troops pay 
the price for being in cities. Instead of making noises about 
India, we should console the suffering Kashmiris. India says 
that it cannot free Kashmir because it will break up the nation. 
However, why should the blood of Kashmiris be used to protect 
India's unity? What kind of logic is this? We are not giving you 
freedom because it will break up our country! If India breaks 
up, let it be. India can tell us that Pakistan must be broken 
into many parts. Will we accept this demand? 
<H5>  What Should Be Our Policy? </H5>
  Our assistance to Kashmir should be free of any weakness or 
flaw. We should not worry about India attacking us and or a war 
against us. India is in no position to start a war as it has a 
lot of its army tied up in Kashmir. Even if it decides to attack 
us, our armed forces are capable of dealing with it. We will 
make this war go on while India would try to decisively defeat 
us in a short period. This is not possible for India. We do not 
want a nuclear war. Instead, we have to prepare our soldiers. 
  We are engrossed in financial profits and our nationalist 
thought is limited. We have to look at the issues within the 
framework of group and personal interests. The main reason for 
our army's existence is defense of Kashmir because defense of 
Kashmir cannot be separated from defense of Pakistan--these are 
like two lives in one frame of body. The defense of Kashmir is 
the combined responsibility of us all, including the armed 
forces. The independence of Kashmir is our responsibility from 
moral, legal, geographical, and historical perspectives. If the 
Pakistani armed forces are sensitive to it, then it is according 
to the natural demands. India considers Kashmir an integral part 
of it without any moral or legal ground. We have thousands of 
such reasons which prove that Kashmir is Pakistan's 
indispensable part. 
  If the Pakistani government demonstrates helplessness or 
carelessness in this matter, we will have to wake up Pakistan 
urban centers, especially the people. If the major cities wake 
up over the Kashmir issue and are prepared to sacrifice their 
lives for their Kashmiri brothers, no government will be able to 
be careless. We must communicate the fact that Pakistan's 
existence depends on Kashmir's freedom to the people, especially 
those living in cities and are progressive and support status 
quo. 
  This is a very welcome development that there is a large 
number of youth in Pakistan that are strongly opposed to the 
Western imperialism. It is true that the power and technology of 
the West is superior to us, however, we have one thing that can 
make us proud and that is our allegiance to our faith. We can 
sacrifice our lives for our religion, which the West cannot do. 
Our ability to sacrifice our lives is our main strength and 
protection. Those who are proud of being secular despite being 
Muslims should learn from the unfortunate situation in Bosnia. 
It is a must that the people of Pakistan unite over the issue of 
Kashmir. If we united then the Muslims in whole South Asia 
including those in India and Bangladesh will also support us 
jointly. However, first we have to be united 
ourselves.

<F P=106> [Article by S.A. Imam: "Plans To Divide Sindh?"] </F>
  [Text] Mr. Altaf Hussain, leader of the MQM [Mohajir Quami 
Movement] , while addressing the convention of the Mohajir 
Rabita Council (Mehdood Group) directly from London by 
telephone, asked mohajir [immigrants from India at the time of 
partition] senior citizens why they established Pakistan. Did 
they establish it so that their mothers, sister, and daughters 
could be humiliated in public? Did they establish it so that the 
government officials would pull the beards of our elders 
[disrespect them] in public? He accused the Pakistani military 
and police personnel of committing atrocities on the mohajirs 
similar to those the Serbs were committing on Bosinian Muslims. 
He said in his speech that while the British controlled the 
sub-continent, they did not commit such atrocities on the 
Muslims as are being committed on mohajirs now. In his opinion, 
even Hindus during the Hindu-Muslim riots were not involved in 
such activities as the Pakistani military and police personnel 
are presently carrying out. The abominations and atrocious acts 
that Mr. Altaf Hussain recounted one after another in his speech 
are the forerunner of a major catastrophe that might occur. 
Perhaps he wants to make the mohajir youth rise against the 
armed forces. While spewing poison against the armed forces, he 
showed his skills in public speaking and uttered dirty 
obscenities against our military. 
  The real chairman of the MQM, Afaq Ahmed, has also expressed 
his opinion at times and is trying to bring the attention of 
older refugees and others to the state government's actions 
against recent refugees to make them "Red Indians" of Pakistan. 
Various actions such as in Maler district, Liari Development 
Authority, Manghu Pir, and Qasimabad district were based purely 
on ethnic consideration in order to distribute the Mohajir vote 
bank in Sindh in such a way that they cannot win any seats. 
  Professor Ghafur Ahmed, vice chairman of Jamaat-i Islami, 
said in a statement that a plan to divide Sindh on ethnic basis 
is being implemented, and the problem of law and order is being 
neglected. Even mohajir elders have started to openly express 
their opinion at various occasions that the mohajirs were being 
pushed against the wall. In this context, mohajir groups are 
planning strategies to protect their interests. 
  The Sindh government is accused of having a prejudiced 
mentality behind all of its actions. The establishment of Maler 
district was declared a mischievous act of a prejudiced 
bureaucrat by Iqbal Yusuf, general secretary of the PPP 
[People's Party of Pakistan]. He said that he made this simple 
administrative act a disputed decision by establishing specific 
boundaries for this district. Abdullah Shah, chief minister of 
Sindh, had no part in deciding the boundaries of this district. 
Many actions such as the establishment of development agencies 
for Liari and Manghu Pir districts, moving the Karachi Medical 
and Dental College under the Sindh government's administration, 
distribution of medical college admission seats by districts, 
and transfer of some female doctors from Karachi to inner Sindh 
have provided some ethnic groups the opportunities to criticize 
the government. They are convinced that all these administrative 
actions were against the Mohajirs. The state chief minister, 
Parvez Ali Shah, and other government leaders have expressed the 
opinion that all these problems can be resolved by talks. Parvez 
Ali Shah had himself gone to Landhi Center to respond to the 
appeal for strike issued by MQM. He had talks with the leaders 
and had agreed on principle to establish a committee to continue 
these talks. However, we do not know which mysterious hand has 
stopped the progress of these talks and has put another block in 
the resolution of the city's problems by widening the chasm 
between these two groups. Parvez Ali Shah said that the MQM has 
shown a lack of patience and has closed the door to more 
negotiations by appealing for another strike. The leaders of the 
MQM, however, complain that the government has a policy of 
procrastination. Anyhow, this deadlock must be broken. Although 
the government has demonstrated goodwill by taking back the 
transfers of female doctors to inner Sindh and allocating 
medical college seats according to district residency, the 
responsibilities of the government are much more than this. It 
must take the initiative to end the ethnic prejudice. This 
government knows about it and Chief Minister Abdullah Shah has 
expressed this opinion while meeting with the Nawaz League, 
Jamaat-i Islami, and Jumiat-i Ulema Pakistan's [JUP Niazi group] 
National Assembly members in Karachi. The talks and actions of 
the PPP state leadership indicate that they also want to take 
some serious action to resolve these problems. However, it 
appears that mischief perpetuated by prejudiced individuals 
prevails. The agents of some forces within the bureaucracy are 
continuously trying to foil the efforts of the democratic 
government. If we look at the situation from the national and 
international perspective we would find that Pakistan is going 
through a very critical phase. The international forces want to 
play some new games using the new world order. The goals of 
these forces are not achieved in a democratic government, and 
martial law could be imposed on this country again. This was 
hinted at by Pir Pagara's mysterious prophesy. Therefore, it is 
important that all patriotic politicians agree on the issue of 
national security and suggest ways to resolve the problem in 
Sindh including Karachi. If they unite, the biased forces that 
hatch conspiracies will be unsuccessful. Despite all their 
political differences, all of them should keep in mind that 
confrontations will not help anyone. Even after two world wars, 
the opposing groups had to resolve their issue at the 
negotiation tables. Therefore, it would be appropriate and 
beneficial to take care of the Sindh issue by holding talks and 
not by fighting. Otherwise, people like Iltaf Hussain will 
present every government action in a negative light and will be 
successful in their goals, which perhaps is what the 
international imperialist powers want.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Printing of Counterfeit Currency in Tribal </F>
Areas" all quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] According to one news report, U.S. intelligence, 
which has been investigating the circulation of 10 million U.S. 
dollars all over the world, has provided the federal Home 
Minister Nasirullah Babar some solid proofs of printing machines 
in operation in tribal areas printing U.S. and Pakistani 
currency. According to this report, paper for this purpose is 
imported from Hungary which is cleared in Peshawar's "dry port." 
It is believed that many influential persons are involved in 
this currency scandal. 
  It is not necessary to mention here the role counterfeit 
currency plays in destroying a country's economy. It was often 
heard in the past that some enemy nations through their 
notorious intelligence agencies were involved in printing 
counterfeit currency and spreading it in our tribal and border 
areas. Some individuals are said to be involved in this wicked 
trade in other parts of the country also. However, the 
information about large-scale and organized efforts to print 
U.S. and Pakistani currency that the U.S. intelligence agency 
has provided to our home ministry appears to be a major 
conspiracy to destroy our national economy. It is possible that 
some foreign hand is behind it. The government should 
immediately investigate this serious situation and take strict 
action against the involved people regardless of their position 
and influence. It should also inform the people of the results 
of this action so that they are aware of what progress has been 
made in this context.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan's Principled Stand on Nuclear </F>
Technology"] 
  [Text] There is no doubt that the need to protect the world 
from the danger of a nuclear war is more important now than ever 
before. Pakistan has been an active supporter of this principle 
on humane grounds from the very beginning. However, as any 
intelligent person can understand, the only way to protect human 
civilization from the nuclear danger is to remove all nuclear 
weapons and related technology from the whole world. It is 
amazing that the United States and some other powers are using 
threats, deceit, avarice, fraud, and other despicable methods 
against the countries that have this technology and whom they 
think are a danger to world peace. However, the countries that 
have the support of the United States and its allies are not 
checked and are allowed to have these destructive weapons as if 
they are toys. This attitude is totally atrocious, unfair, and 
extreme. It is especially used against Pakistan and other 
Islamic countries, North Korea, and other third world countries 
about which the United States and its allies for some reason do 
not have a good opinion. Let us reflect a bit. If India has a 
stockpile of nuclear weapons and Pakistan is stopped even from 
using this technology for peaceful uses, how can they guarantee 
making this region safe from nuclear dangers? This situation can 
help only make nuclear weapons available for unilateral 
expansionist designs. Had Japan had nuclear weapons, we can 
safely say that nuclear bombs would not have been dropped on its 
two highly populated cities. Therefore, seriousness and 
responsibility calls for the United States and its cohort 
nations to either totally end nuclear technology in the whole 
world or at least form a fair policy for controlling nuclear 
weapons in this region, instead of coming after the Pakistani 
nuclear program. If this is not done, then Pakistan has no 
reason to have its hands amputated and live at the mercy of a 
cruel country like India. Doing this would be more dangerous 
than signing one's own death sentence.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Federal Cabinet Defense Committee's Decisions"] </F>
  [Text] The Defense Committee of the federal cabinet under 
the chairmanship of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had an 
important meeting and decided that Pakistan will not reduce its 
defense budget, traditional weapons, or armed forces. The 
Defense Committee met for three hours and discussed the defense 
budget, the Kashmir resolution, Sindh operation, reinstatement 
of U.S. aid, purchasing important equipment for the army, navy, 
and the air force, the situation in Afghanistan, and the 
national defense and security. 
  All the issues discussed in the Defense Committee meeting 
are 
very important against the background of the regional and 
international political situation. However, national defense and 
an increase in our armed forces are priority issues because of 
the withdrawal of the resolution on human rights violations in 
Kashmir that was presented in the UN Human Rights Commission and 
the Indian reaction to it. The political and geographical 
situation of the region in which Pakistan is located, especially 
the Kashmir dispute and the attitude of Indian government about 
it, does not allow any Pakistani government to even think about 
taking the risk of reducing our armed forces. Pakistan has 
always maintained that permanent peace in this region can be 
established if the Kashmir issue is resolved according to the UN 
resolutions. After it, bilateral discussions with India can be 
held to reduce military spending in both countries. However, No 
Pakistani government can take a step to ignore its national 
security just because the United States or some other country 
wants Pakistan to unilaterally sign the NPT or roll back its 
nuclear program. Neither can such a decision of a superpower be 
imposed on Pakistan. 
  After assurance by some friendly nations and seeing the 
stance of some member nations of the Human Rights Commission, 
Pakistan had postponed the resolution on human rights violation 
in occupied Kashmir by India. However, the Indian government 
reacted to it by refusing permission to Pakistani and Libyan 
ambassadors to visit occupied Kashmir. It has not permitted 
Amnesty International to visit occupied Kashmir to investigate 
the situation there. It even turned down offers by Iran and 
other countries to help with reconciliation over Kashmir. India 
announced this in response to the Iranian representative's 
statement in the United Nations offering to continue work on 
reconciliation over Kashmir. The Indian attitude shows that it 
is not willing to give any importance to the UN resolution and 
give up its customary rigidity over the Kashmir issue. 
Therefore, Pakistan has no alternative but to decide not to 
reduce its defense budget or reduce its armed forces. Instead, 
in the light of bitter experience of the past, Pakistan badly 
needs to improve its defense capabilities. The U.S. restrictions 
on weapons aid calls for us to focus on purchasing weapons from 
other countries and to use all our resources to strengthen our 
defense. 
  In the light of the situation described above, there is no 
room for disagreeing with the government's decision. The 
decision of the Defense Committee reflects the feelings of the 
people. Since these decisions are related to our national 
security and independence, it would not be inappropriate to 
expect the opposition parties to show their agreement with the 
government despite their political and ideological differences 
in the greater interests of the nation. These are the kind of 
affairs that require all national groups to show full 
cooperation and agreement. It is the duty of the government in 
this situation to soften its policies in order to get the 
opposition's cooperation and work with it. Efforts must be made 
to get the support and cooperation from all political groups. 
The cooperation of the government and the opposition will 
guarantee stability within our administration and the government 
will be able to confront the Indian situation with more 
confidence.

<F P=106> [Article by Pinhas 'Inbari] </F>
  [Text] Reports from Cairo, that Israel and the PLO are 
close to signing an agreement on introduction of a Palestinian 
police force in Hebron along with an international force, for 
the most part have been welcomed in Israel, accompanied by the 
sense that a breakthrough has been made. Only in Hebron, the 
object of this joy, was the news greeted with skepticism. So far 
as can be determined, it seems that the Palestinian police will 
not be met with the celebrations that were held for returning 
prisoners. The rivers of blood shed by residents of the city 
during confrontations with settlers and clashes with the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces], the continuing curfew and the dire 
economic situation are just one side of the terrible anguish 
that, in the wake of the slaughter in the Cave of Makhpela, is 
the legacy of these times. Yet it appears that the worst is 
still to come. Not only have they yet to pay the full price of 
the burden of life under the occupation with settlers 
malevolently close by, but they are also now threatened by the 
ugly specter of civil war. 
  Mustafa 'Abd A-nabi Natshe, Hebron's deposed mayor and one 
of 
PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat's prominent supporters, was very 
careful this week. Natshe, a candidate to return and take back 
leadership of the city, hinted without saying so outright that 
he prefers to operate by other means, without a police force. "I 
still do not know what the extent of my authority will be or how 
authority will be split between the city, Israel and the 
international force," he said cautiously. In any event, he hopes 
to work through political and civic means. The issue of 
settlement in Hebron must be the first item for discussion on 
the agenda. "Whenever a settler attacks a city resident, I will 
demand that Israel take action against him," he stressed. 
  Like the great majority of Hebron's inhabitants, Natshe 
blames Israel for creating an atmosphere inappropriate to the 
peace talks. For instance, the steps taken in the city center, 
closing it down to prevent friction between Hebronites and 
settlers, is choking the entire city. It is impossible, he says, 
that the settlers should commit a massacre and the residents 
have to pay the price. Contrary to reports about removal of the 
settlers, he adds, another four settler families entered the 
"Abraham our Father" zone immediately after the curfew was 
lifted. 
  Attorney Husayn a-Shyukhi is one of Hebron's leading 
political activists and known to be close to 'Arafat. Precisely 
for that reason, the positions openly expressed by someone of 
his standing have to set off red lights in Tunis. Says 
a-Shyukhi: "The massacre in the Cave of Makhpela and the horrors 
that followed in Hebron have been like an earthquake that has 
fundamentally changed the terms that prevailed before that. No 
one today can foresee the future without making mistakes or 
errors in judgment. The Palestinian street in general, and in 
Hebron in particular, no longer accepts the rules made in Oslo, 
and even those who supported the Oslo agreements, and after that 
the Cairo agreements, now demand that they be changed, 
especially the principle of dividing the negotiations into two 
stages. The questions of settlement, Jerusalem and the Cave of 
Makhpela have forced themselves onto the terms of discussion and 
cannot be put off any longer. In other words, not Gaza and 
Jericho first but all the territories now have to be on the 
negotiating table." 
  To grasp how someone in the central stream of 'Arafat 
supporters can speak that way, one has to understand political 
developments in Hebron immediately after the massacre, in 
particular the rising tension in most parts of Hebron and, 
within them, between people known over the years as 'Arafat 
supporters and the Tunis leadership. Right after the massacre, 
the people of Hebron tried to establish a central institution 
without a leader, the "Emergency Committee," to unite the city's 
organizations and represent all the political streams on an 
equal footing. The Emergency Committee, however, did not catch 
on and, by all appearances, the two major political forces, 
Hamas [islamic Resistance Movement] and Fatah, tried to take the 
city's reins of leadership during its black hour of trial. Hamas 
gained the upper hand. The families of the murdered preferred to 
establish a committee led by someone from Hamas that would deal 
with their concerns. Hamas and Fatah set up separate commissions 
of inquiry. Apparently, the Hamas commission won greater 
cooperation from the people of Hebron than did the Fatah 
commission. 
  Hamas was aided not just by Hebron's extraordinary piety, 
and 
not just by the widespread opinion that the massacre was 
perpetrated due to the peace talks with the PLO, in which 
attention was given solely to the security needs of the settlers 
while the PLO ignored the security needs of the Palestinians, 
but also by Hamas' success in concealing its differences in 
opinion and working in harmony while the PLO spoke in two voices 
in a way that projected confusion and internal divisions. One 
group in Fatah was composed of well-known political people such 
as Natshe, the deposed mayor, and Fa'iz Qawasme, the brother of 
the expelled mayor, Fahd Qawasme, who was murdered in exile in 
Rabat Amon. They tried to join up with members of the 
Palestinian delegation headquartered in Orient House and forged 
ties to the head of the Palestinian negotiating team in 
Washington, Sa'ib 'Eraqat, who was then in east Jerusalem 
because Husayni had gone to Tunis. 
  A second group, led by 'Abas Zaki, who openly opposes 
'Arafat's policies, is linked to the western sector of Rabat 
Amon. This group has shown itself stronger and would like to 
collaborate with Hamas and representatives of the refusal 
organizations. The internal struggle sharpened when, on March 
21, 'Arafat appointed the "Hebron District Council," a large 
body of 73 (some say 85) members that is supposed to take 
control of the area, similar to the center in Orient House. At 
the head of this body, 'Arafat put 'Ali Qawasme, a Fatah 
activist close to Husayni. Hamas, the refusal organizations and 
the 'Abas Zaki wing in Fatah instantly realized the significance 
of the appointments to the district council and announced their 
opposition the same day. 
  The surprise came from those people who were expected to 
stand with 'Arafat on the day of reckoning. Nabil J'abari, a 
central Fatah activist who had represented 'Arafat in Hebron for 
years and been a member of the Palestinian delegation to both 
Madrid and Washington, was included on the district council list 
as a matter of course. The next day, however, he published a 
paid-for announcement on the front page of AL-QUDS, declaring 
that he rejected the appointment because: "Our people are now 
capable of discussion and elections. The people of the Hebron 
district can devise a lawful and popularly based body to look 
after their interests and rights. The idea behind the 
appointments...is one we reject." 
  Muhmad Horanif, one of the leading activists in the Fatah 
wing that supports 'Arafat, announced the day after the 
appointments that "the council has been frozen." 'Arafat's 
inability to appoint a council raised grave questions about his 
ability to rule in Hebron. A-Shyukhi: "I can state without a 
doubt that the Palestinian leadership does not exercise any 
control in the Hebron region because it has lost all its 
credibility. Its assets amount to less than 1 percent. Chairman 
'Arafat decided to set up the council but used methods that are 
not acceptable to us, dictates from above that gave priority to 
a certain sector and overlooked others. The result was that he 
was forced to rescind his decision one day after he made it. If 
he changed his decision hours after making it, he has to change 
all his calculations. The council he set up ignored all the 
fighters, all the Palestinian organizations, all the political 
parties and entire neighborhoods in Hebron even though they are 
the parts of town that have struggled the most. Similarly, there 
was no representation for whole villages, such as Tarqumiya, 
Shyukh, Samo'a, Beit-'Awa and Nuba." 
  J'abari's words brings to the fore one of the most important 
disputes between Tunis and PLO supporters in the territories, 
the nature of the future Palestinian entity. While 'Arafat seeks 
to appoint his loyalists to key posts, the political leadership 
demands elections. 'Arafat has already attempted to name Mansur 
Shawa mayor of Gaza but a coalition made up of a majority of the 
political forces in the city foiled his plans. The failure in 
Gaza is threatening to recur in Hebron. There is growing 
opposition in the territories to the parameters laid down in 
Oslo heedless of the leadership of the territories. 
  On 25 March, the day marked for the Cairo agreements 
permitting resumption of the talks, representatives of a 
majority of the organizations and groups, some 100 persons, 
convened in Hebron. What they decided is unknown. A-Shyukhi 
describes the general atmosphere. "Community activists in Hebron 
are against continuing with 'Arafat's methods. They feel that he 
has to distinguish between the stage of rule and the stage of 
revolution. The stage of creating a government requires certain 
tactics, the stage of administration and revolution requires 
others. 'Arafat does not separate the stage of revolution from 
the stage of rule and administration. You can see this as well 
in the way he has conducted the negotiations with Israel. The 
Palestinians were on a lower level, and the Palestinian 
delegation could not stand up to the terms and issues set by 
Israel and the United States, which were on a higher level. 
Every round of the negotiations was without experts and 
everything depended on one person ('Arafat). Resumption of the 
talks in the same manner definitely will lead to failure and a 
dead end. Likewise, UN Resolution 904 cannot serve as a basis 
for renewal of the talks because it does not include the minimum 
Palestinians demands. 
  "I am amazed that the talks with Israel are resuming on the 
basis of sending police to Hebron. What Hebron needs today is 
not police. It has been under curfew for a month, its economy is 
collapsing, unemployment is growing, and with that there is 
hunger. Hebron needs industry and revival of its social and 
economic institutions, not police--even if it were to mean 
100,000 police officers. IDF operations in Hebron against Hamas, 
in which the IDF has mobilized the best of its men and its most 
advanced technology, prove that a Palestinian police force is 
not the answer to our needs and will solve nothing. It will not 
prevent the next massacre. Can a Palestinian policeman impose a 
curfew on Qiryat Arb'a? Will the Palestinian police be able to 
stop a single one of the settlers' children? The police are not 
and never have been the solution. The solution is not to 
continue the talks on the basis of establishing a police force 
but to discard the principle of two stages and to bring 
Palestinian experts into the talks. I am puzzled by Rabin. His 
peace with 'Arafat will be the peace of men but not of nations, 
and will have no value. True peace is one of trust and 
convincing the Palestinian people that they have, indeed, 
realized their dreams. Any other peace will lead to two nations 
beset by tragedy and further bloodshed." 
  A-Shyukhi emphasizes that he cannot be considered an 
opponent 
of 'Arafat or of the peace process. On the contrary, "I am for 
peace and striving for peace, but on the basis of Palestinian 
national unity and within a framework that will be acceptable to 
most of the people without coercion from above. But events have 
laid bare the fact that the frameworks in which the talks are 
being conducted have been exhausted. Even leaders of the 
delegation such as Husayni, 'Arafat and Abd A-Shafi demand new 
frameworks and formulas that will place Hebron, Jerusalem and 
the settlements at the top of the agenda. 
  "I admire and greatly respect Chairman 'Arafat. He is the 
symbol of Palestine. He has dedicated his life to his people and 
independence. I am convinced that he is trying to get the 
maximum for the Palestinian people. But the route he is taking 
and his way of working will not bring him to realization of his 
goals. So I am calling for him to take a break of 24 hours, to 
get away from the pressures, the slogans and the faxes, and 
think in quiet about the way to get out of this dead end. I know 
that many leaders do this. During World War II, Churchill did 
not forsake his weekly holiday. I saw 'Arafat some months ago in 
Tunis. I felt sorry for him. He was utterly exhausted. The 
tremendous effort he is making is wearing him out. Whatever I 
have said is for his benefit so he can look after himself. 
'Arafat also has to change the fax numbers of people in the 
territories and listen to what the strong are saying--not the 
weak. I want 'Arafat to consider what I am saying as a kind of 
open letter to him, to pay attention to what people are saying." 
  For all that, A-Shyukhi's observations on the Palestinian 
police are unequivocal. "In Hebron, Abu 'Amar ('Arafat) sees the 
police as a branch of the Border Patrol. I think that will lead 
all the officers to resign. Even Antoine Lahad's position in 
South Lebanon is better, since he at least has an army under his 
command. The Palestinian police will be under Israeli control. 
'Arafat has to know not only how to talk with Rabin and [Gen. 
Amnon] Shahaq but with the young men of Fatah and the national 
streams such as the National Front, the Democratic [Front] and 
Hamas. 'Arafat's arrival in Jericho before he comes to an 
understanding with the Palestinians and arranges a framework of 
national unity will convert the Palestinian police into an 
instrument of repression, and I am sure that it will refuse to 
act as a repressive force." 
  One complication involving the police is the need to make 
changes in the city. Natshe was deposed in 1973 and, since 1976, 
the city has been administered by an Israeli official--a friend 
of the settlers, of course. This year, according to a secret 
agreement between Israel and Jordan, city leaders acceptable to 
both countries were appointed, among them the current mayor, 
'Abd al-Majid a-Zir. The Democratic Front's Hebron branch 
immediately declared its opposition to the isolated actions of 
appointing Zir and holding elections in Hebron. The Democratic 
Front announced in a poster on 28 March that without restoring 
all deposed mayors, it would be impossible to return Natshe to 
his post. The Democratic Front's reason--the dean of mayors 
elected in 1976, Basam Shakh'a of Shehem, belongs to the refusal 
front and the Democratic Front does not accept a situation in 
which only those mayors who support 'Arafat, and none of his 
opponents, are reinstated. Thus, the complications in Hebron are 
also spreading at least to Shehem. 
  A-Shyukhi concludes, "The Tunis leadership's treatment of 
the 
events in Hebron, the massacre and its ramifications have raised 
a high wall between it and the entire Hebron district. The 
public in Hebron hoped that the leadership would pay close 
attention to the city's mood. We were amazed by remarks made by 
Nabil Sha'at that the Palestinian police will protect certain 
people in Hebron and certain institutions that were not in 
danger in the past and will not be in the future. Would even 
1,000 Palestinian policemen have prevented Goldstein and his 
confederates from [perpetrating] the massacre in Hebron?" 
  [Box, p 3] 
<H5>  Waiting for 'Arafat in Gaza </H5>
  People in Israel are attuned to the tense atmosphere in 
Hebron and the steep decline in support for 'Arafat. A senior 
Israeli defense official says that Israel hopes that the PLO 
leader's arrival in the territories will be accompanied by 
displays of rejoicing and euphoria that will change the national 
mood. 'Arafat also will bring money with him, hand out sinecures 
and have a police force, which will enable him to tilt the 
balance in his favor. The arrival of the international force 
also will impart a feeling of a change for the better. 
  While buds of opposition to 'Arafat are sprouting on the 
West 
Bank and in Hebron, the picture is different in Gaza. There, in 
Hamas' stronghold, ironically, movement towards 'Arafat has been 
noted. Gazans are waiting for a change and the arrangements with 
Israeli are giving them a new chance, the defense official said. 
But he made these comments before the unfortunate incident in 
which IDF soldiers killed six Fatah Hawks in Gaza. It still is 
not clear how the agreements on the Palestinian police will be 
greeted in Gaza. [end box]

<F P=106> [Review by Belkacem Rouache of book: Faillite des </F>
politicards algeriens (The Failure of Algeria's Political 
Leaders) by Maamar Boudersa, Rocher Noir, 1994] 
  [Text] Written in direct, straightforward style, 
Faillite des politicards algeriens is a book about 
contemporary Algeria by an academic who goes straight to the 
heart of the matter by analyzing the current situation of the 
country and the factors that have brought it to ruin. 
  "The policies adopted by Chadli sowed the seeds of social 
instability, political confusion, and economic crisis," writes 
Boudersa on page 25 of the book. 
  The author divides the book into four main parts: general 
political principles; the crisis and solutions; the providential 
man; and impediments to a solution. There is also a concluding 
section with bibliographical references. 
  Citing Ibn Khaldoan, the author notes that: "war is natural 
to man: Any nation, any race can serve as an example." 
  And examples are cited: the FLN [National Liberation Front] 
versus French colonialism, Fidel Castro, diverse Third World 
leaders combating underdevelopment, as well as the "wars" of 
Western democracies against unemployment and inflation. 
  In Algeria, two statesmen opted for policies based on the 
"war footing" principle. The first, says the author, was 
Boumediene. 
  "The nation, he said, had enemies to vanquish: 
neocolonialism, underdevelopment, illiteracy, regional 
imbalance, poverty, misery, and injustices." 
  The second "warrior" who imposed himself on the national 
political scene was Mohamed Boudiaf. The latter openly declared 
war on the Algerian politico-financial "mafia," the author 
notes. He quickly won legitimacy once he opted--intuitively, and 
quite sincerely--for a policy based on the "war" that was 
Boumediene's legacy. Indeed, his "battle" was espoused by the 
entire nation, by society as a whole. 
  Maamar Boudersa says that politicians and statesmen who 
ignore this principle and fail to apply it lead their country 
down the path to instability, turbulence, even civil war. 
  Chadli, with his policies aimed at preserving power by 
methods opposite to Boumediene's, sowed the seeds of political 
and economic instability. 
  Thus Chadli, under the slogan "for a better life," gave 
economic preference to consumption, to the detriment of 
investment. 
  The author notes that this policy, presupposing a limited 
economic role for the state, was inspired more by Keynes than by 
Marx or Lenin, as others have tried to argue. 
  The author organizes the second part of Faillite des 
politicards algeriens around studies of Algeria's heads of 
government since the unrest of October 1988. 
  Hamrouche and Ghozali, he says, followed the same policies 
as 
their predecessors. The predecessors: in other words, those who 
contributed, each in his own way, to the decade of the 
1980's--which as everyone knows ended up destabilizing state, 
society, and the national economy. Abdelhamid Brahimi was not 
the only one to blame, he says. The team included Chadli, Taleb 
Ahmed Brahimi, Larbi Belkheir, Belkaid Mehri, Messaadia, 
Abdelghani, Belakhdar... 
  In all this criticism, our scholar spares Abdessalem, who he 
says tried to solve the underlying problems, rather than just 
put out brush fires like Hamrouche and Ghozali. 
  However, we know that even Abdessalem ultimately failed. 
During his tenure, Algeria fell into a major economic recession, 
aggravated by a policy that made war against practically 
everyone but failed to score any victories. 
  Boudiafism! The author writes that the assassination of 
President Boudiaf has benefited those who opposed him and who 
after his death have sought to bask in his political legacy. 
Boudersa recalls in this connection what Lenin wrote about false 
Marxists: "Throughout history, after the death of revolutionary 
leaders who were popular with the oppressed classes, the enemies 
of those leaders have tried to exploit the reputation of the 
deceased to dupe the oppressed." 
  Islamism versus nationalism. 
  The author writes that in order to realize its political 
objectives, the outgrowths of a defeatist policy, and destroy 
the system based on Boumediene's "war" legacy, a secret weapon 
was chosen--a weapon that according to the author was eminently 
serviceable, of local fabrication, and historically durable: 
realization of the "old and defunct reformist-colonial project 
introduced as an alternative to the national-liberation vision." 
  In the same vein, the author notes that the national charter 
of 1976 was "enriched" in this direction, when the national 
commission chaired by Taleb Ahmed called for establishment of an 
Islamic state as elaborated by Mohamed Harbi's in 
L'Algerie et son destin [Algeria and its Destiny]. 
  Even Hamrouche discussed it in his talks at Matignon (Paris) 
with Michel Rocard, as reported by the press: "The rise of 
Islam, amplified by the French media, he said, disturbed and 
dumbfounded many people, he said. But the government was never 
upset or fearful. His analysis was correct. Events showed we 
were right." 
  "The influence of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] quickly 
ran up against its limits... Now...I have a real problem: I 
would not like to see the FIS disappear. It is necessary for 
this abscess of fixation, this socially reactionary formation, 
to remain." 
  As for impediments to resolution of the crisis, Boudersa 
says 
that while corruption may have been the common denominator of 
the political coalitions responsible for the country's ruin, the 
only possible way to rebuild it is through a coalition against 
corruption. 
  Boudersa bases this conclusion on the principle of war. 
Boumediene made war on unemployment, the enemies of the nation, 
underdevelopment, regional imbalance, illiteracy, and poverty. 
Boudiaf made war on corruption, Chadli made war on Algeria. 
  An impassioned book, of burning relevance to today's 
problems, and a very fast read.

<F P=106> [Article: "Letter From FLN to Zeroual: `Government Isolated </F>
From Society'"] 
  [Text] The "letter" that the FLN [National Liberation 
Front] was supposed to have handed over to the president of 
state--a letter announced with a great deal of publicity--ended 
up being forgotten completely. The contents of the document were 
made public yesterday. The document states that the letter was 
given to Zeroual by the FLN delegation last Saturday. It should 
be noted that that meeting between the president of state and 
the FLN delegation was not announced by either the office of the 
president or Mehri's party. 
  It is also worth noting that the FLN waited until dialogue 
had resumed before announcing its official stands on the overall 
situation in the country. 
  In its letter, the FLN sticks to its stands regarding the 
existing institutions, which it still considers to be illegal. 
"The government alone, with institutions that are paralyzed or 
at a standstill and whose authority is diminishing every day, is 
incapable of bringing the country out of this complex situation 
because it is isolated from society," the FLN document 
emphasizes. A resolute supporter of a rapid return to the 
electoral process and the elected institutions, the FLN feels 
that it is impossible to "defer the real political solutions 
required by that complex situation without exposing the state 
and society to collapse and division." The HCE's [Higher State 
Council's] management is considered "a failure in every area." 
"It is essential to change that policy," the FLN notes in its 
letter to Zeroual. The change must take place with the help of 
"the country's influential political forces." That is what the 
FLN means by its fetish formula "serious and thorough dialogue." 
The FLN's letter clearly identifies those forces, although they 
are not mentioned explicitly. According to the document 
addressed to the chief of state, the FLN Political Bureau feels 
that "the parties that emerged during the legislative elections 
of 26 December 1991--regardless of any disagreements as to their 
results--are now destined to assume special responsibilities." 
To put that in clearer terms, it means, according to the FLN's 
logic, the three fronts: the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], the 
FFS [Socialist Forces Front], and the FLN. Mehri's party 
occasionally returns to the attack with the proposal that was 
made and rejected in the days of the HCE: to call a meeting of 
the "major parties"--or what it regards as the major parties. 
The FLN considers it "an essential task" to invite those 
parties, which it does not name, "to a common meeting that will 
be announced to the people." But to salve its conscience, the 
FLN also says that "by no means does this mean ignoring other 
opinions, marginalizing other political or social forces, or 
excluding them from that dialogue." The FLN says it is in favor 
of enlarging the dialogue but not diluting it. 
  The objective of national dialogue, the FLN emphasizes, "is 
to reach agreement on solutions likely to bring our country out 
of the cycle of violence, ensure serenity in all homes, and 
restore to the state its constitutional and legitimate framework 
as that derives from the people's choice." The FLN feels that 
"the chances for the success of national dialogue still exist, 
although they are growing slimmer." Prior conditions must be 
met, the FLN says. Among those conditions, the FLN is convinced 
of the need to "create an indispensable climate of detente so 
that all the political and social forces can go along with it, 
support it, and prepare to take responsibility for its results." 
  In other words, the FLN is asking for nothing less than a 
continuation and further development of the so-called 
pacification measures that were initiated by the HCE and 
expanded--when Zeroual became chief of state--by releasing the 
prisoners in the southern camps and the two FIS leaders, among 
other things. The idea of calling up reservists to support the 
security forces in maintaining order and protecting property and 
people from terrorist acts, as mentioned by the minister of 
interior, apparently does not appeal to the FLN, which views the 
measure as "a serious sign of the persistence of a policy of 
confrontation and a new step further involving the ANP [People's 
National Army] in a confrontation that prevents it from assuming 
its role of arbiter and wise guarantor of the hoped-for 
agreement among the parties to dialogue."

<F P=106> [Article by S.B.: "FIS Leaders Deny Pledge To End </F>
Terrorism"] 
  [Text] Yesterday Mr. Boukhamkham and Mr. Djeddi, the two 
FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] leaders freed on 23 February, 
broke the public silence that they have maintained since then 
except at certain mosques where, by some accounts, they have 
preached virulent sermons critical of the regime. 
  Their statement, which came as no surprise to political 
observers, was clearly triggered by the recent communique from 
the Algerian presidency accusing leaders of the dissolved FIS of 
failing to honor commitments they had made to President Liamine 
Zeroual during a meeting at Blida that was kept secret until 
only a few days ago. 
  The "internal wing of the FIS" felt obliged to react to the 
presidential communique, which had put it in an embarrassing 
position, undercutting its public posture. The regime seems 
unconcerned about reactions from the armed groups or from FIS 
spokesmen overseas. What it was watching for was a reaction from 
the FIS leaders with whom official contacts had been held; thus 
this communique from two FIS leaders who were "graduates" of 
Blida was important because it constituted a first response to 
the authorities' overtures. 
  The freed FIS leaders--acting, it must be assumed, at the 
behest of their leaders, Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj--took 
pains in the communique they sent to AFP yesterday to deny the 
assertions in the presidency communique. The statement by the 
FIS leaders leads one to conclude either that the presidency 
omitted significant details from its description of the meeting 
between the incarcerated FIS leaders and Mr. Zeroual (who at the 
time was defense minister for the HCE [Higher State Council]), 
or that Boukhamkham and Djeddi are deliberately lying in a bid 
to regain lost ground with the general public, by turning the 
authorities' own arguments against them: specifically, by 
alleging that it was the presidency that failed to meet its 
commitments. 
  First of all, concerning the supposed promise by the 
incarcerated FIS leaders to issue an appeal to end the violence, 
as the presidency has asserted: The FIS communique denies making 
such an offer and maintains that the detained FIS leaders 
"rejected as premature and ineffective the proposal made by the 
defense minister, General Liamine Zeroual, for the FIS to urge 
the people to remain calm and law abiding." 
<H5>  Serious Accusations </H5>
  What is important about the statement is not whether the 
defense minister or FIS leaders were telling the truth--someday 
the history will come out, perhaps sooner than one might think, 
since some sources say that recordings were made of the meetings 
with the FIS--but rather the fact that the FIS admits it is 
behind the terrorist acts. By denying they had pledged to stop 
terrorism, the FIS leaders implicitly admitted that they have 
the capacity to do so--or at least that they feel they do--and 
claimed credit for the acts of violence. 
  The communique initialed by the two freed FIS leaders says 
that the only commitment made by their leaders in detention was 
to "seek a solution that is just and in accordance with the 
shari'ah, in order to put an end to political and social 
injustice and spare future generations from sanguinary 
conflict." It is easy to see, if this statement is analyzed 
closely, that FIS leaders see a commitment to help restore civil 
peace as but the final stage of a process that should begin with 
resolution of the political question, among other things by 
rehabilitation of the dissolved party and release of all 
incarcerated FIS leaders. The explicit reference to the shari'ah 
is a way for FIS leaders to reaffirm their commitment to a 
vision of society that they have always promoted and that they 
are not prepared to negotiate away, even from behind prison bars. 
  The FIS communique spells out three conditions for "a 
political solution to the political crisis and insecurity 
racking the country." First, "the unconditional release of FIS 
leaders, because imprisonment is a constraint, and when a man is 
under constraint he cannot be responsible;" second, "access to 
full and complete information on the general situation in the 
country in all its political, economic, social, and security 
aspects, so it will be possible to design an adequate solution, 
in accordance with the shari'ah, that will save the country and 
the people;" and finally, "permission to remain in direct 
contact and consult widely with the other leaders, since we are 
all members of one group and cannot make decisions without 
consulting with our brothers." Observers will have noted that 
the internal political wing of the FIS has softened its earlier 
demands: At one time, it demanded nothing less than to come to 
power via a return to the electoral process and the status quo 
ante of 26 December 1992. The three conditions posed by the two 
FIS leaders, with the concurrence of their incarcerated chiefs, 
mark a significant break with both the intransigence of the 
armed groups--who respect nothing but brute force--and the 
increasingly strident extremism of the party leaders in exile. 
Readers are reminded of the six "commandments" of Rabah Kebir, 
who demanded not only the release of the FIS leaders and all the 
imprisoned party militants, but also trials for the country's 
current leaders and the holding of a dialogue in a neutral 
country. The question thus arises: Which of the groups has 
legitimacy--the armed groups, the FIS's internal political wing, 
or the leadership in exile? 
  The FIS communique also informs us that Mr. Zeroual promised 
incarcerated FIS leaders the unconditional release of four of 
the seven leaders held at Blida, the transfer to house arrest of 
Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj, and closing of the "security 
centers" in the south before the end of the month of Ramadhan. 
Not only were these promises not kept, the communique says, 
but--an even more serious accusation--also some detainees freed 
from the camps in the south were killed almost as soon as they 
returned to their homes. 
  We must certainly expect that within the next few hours the 
presidency will respond to the allegations in the FIS 
communique.

<F P=106> [Article by K. Zeghloul: "Sources of Terrorist Financing"] </F>
  [Text] After the arrest in Lille of two FIS [Islamic 
Salvation Front] militants on charges of drug trafficking and 
possession of weapons, ammunition, and important Algerian 
administrative documents, the French press is raising disturbing 
questions about the activities of the fundamentalist movement in 
France. 
  The traffic in counterfeit Lacoste shirts that made so many 
headlines turns out to have been just a minor sideline. The 
mainspring of the fundamentalist movement in France, the 
dissolved FIS, is diversifying sources of financing for its 
armed struggle in Algeria. After relying first on aid from 
countries committed to exporting their ideology, then on 
begging, gifts, hold-ups, and rackets, it is now resorting to 
drug trafficking to finance its jihad against society and 
Algeria's republican state. The former party of Abassi Madani 
has built up a network of drug dealers. One such ring was just 
recently dismantled in Lille (France), in an investigation of 
heroin trafficking in the prostitute demimonde of the town, 
which is a veritable crossroads because of its proximity to 
Belgium and the Netherlands. 
  These two countries are known for their permissiveness on 
drugs. According to investigators with the French Judicial 
Police [PJ], "some of those arrested averred to the examining 
magistrate in Lille that one Hassan Tobal, a drug trafficker for 
the dissolved FIS and confederate of two militants arrested on 
21 March for `conspiracy in a terrorist plot,'" turned over a 
portion of drug proceeds to members of the Islamist movement. 
  The profits from this network alone over the two years or 
more it operated were in excess of 9 million francs [Fr]. In 
addition, there were "commissions" extracted from independent 
dealers. 
  In September 1993, about 10 ex-FIS militants were arrested 
in 
Rotterdam for drug trafficking. Among them were the imam of a 
mosque in the Lille suburbs, the head of an antidrug 
organization in Roubaix, and several individuals who hunt down 
dealers (sic). Readers are reminded of the much-publicized 
French Interior Ministry report to the Elysee, which was 
followed by the expulsion from France of Kamreddine Kharbane, 
ex-FIS representative in France, and Boudjemaa Bounoua, a Saudi 
Arabia-based recruiter of Algerian volunteers for Afghanistan. 
  The ministry's explosive report noted that a re-Islamization 
of the "beurs" [second-generation Arab immigrants in France] in 
the same forms as those already adopted by apparently isolated 
activists and certain voluntary associations acting under 
humanitarian cover could lead to "a drift toward terrorism of 
certain small groups within that movement (Editor's Note: the 
fundamentalist movement)." Events have proved these fears 
well-founded. 
  Numerous charitable associations ostensibly "working" 
against 
drug addiction and crime or to improve recreational 
opportunities in the suburbs, are in fact working to infiltrate 
and organize young Muslim immigrants. 
  In that context, the violent "hunt" for dealers led by the 
Islamists, especially Kraouche's FAF [Algerian Fraternity in 
France], as a "justifying cause," was undertaken in reality not 
to suppress them but to supplant them in this lucrative traffic. 
  According to the French weekly VSD, drug trafficking is one 
of the principal sources of financing for the dissolved FIS, 
which, in addition to its French networks, reportedly also 
relies on a Pakistani network to transport narcotics from Iran 
and Afghanistan to Europe. 
  In its July 1993 issue, LA DEPECHE INTERNATIONALE DES 
DROGUES 
classified Algeria as a producer country or transit point for 
international drug trafficking. 
  The Geopolitical Drug Observatory (OGD) noted, after an 
investigation of the Staoueli poppy fields (summer 1992), that 
"Algerian PJ do not believe, however,that the fundamentalists 
are setting up narcotics trafficking rings, at least not on 
Algerian territory." The "most reasonable hypothesis," according 
to the PJ, was that some Afghans "are seeking to satisfy a taste 
for artificial paradises, which they acquired during their 
sojourn in Asia." Various indicators seem to discredit that 
hypothesis--for example, the fact that the Uzis and Scorpios 
found in the terrorists' lairs are the weapons of choice for 
international drug rings with ties to arms traffickers. 
  Is such a hypothesis plausible, when we know that all over 
the world armed insurrectionary movements (Peru, Kashmir, 
Punjab, Pakistan, Casamance, etc.) are financed in part by drug 
trafficking? And that these same movements, especially since the 
end of the Cold War, are increasingly acquiring a direct or 
indirect strangelhold on these phenomenal sources of income? 
  Can Algeria's fundamentalist movement be expected to turn 
its 
back on this manna when the borders, especially with Morocco, 
leak like a sieve? Even though they have never ceased clamoring 
for the establishment of an Islamic state, no matter what the 
cost? 
<H5>  Official Assassinated </H5>
  Attendance was sparse yesterday at burial services for Mr. 
Belaid Meziane, the UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers] 
national secretary for union training programs who was 
assassinated on Thursday. The several dozen people who 
accompanied to his final resting place this victim of cowardly 
assassins carried themselves with solemnity and dignity, tinged 
with sadness and consternation. 
  A communication slip-up was apparently responsible for the 
small turnout by militants and workers affiliated with the labor 
central. 
  On Thursday at 1430, Belaid Meziane left the home of his 
sister in the Diar El Djemaa development in Bachdjarah commune. 
His young nephew accompanied him in his vehicle. Several meters 
down the road, Meziane slowed down to avoid a crevice. 
  Two youths waiting at that very spot--obviously familiar 
with 
his itinerary for the day--stepped in front of the vehicle to 
block his path, fired a first bullet that hit him in the throat, 
then a second and fatal bullet that hit him in the neck. Taken 
immediately to Belfort hospital, Belaid Meziane, age 51, 
succumbed to his wounds. 
<H5>  Communique </H5>
  The Ettahadi-Tafat movement has issued a communique 
condemning this new assassination: 
  "This odious assassination follows attacks against Abdelhak 
Benhamouda, secretary of the UGTA, and shows that the 
fundamentalists are committed to destabilizing the labor central 
and preventing it from taking antifundamentalist positions that 
correspond to the basic interests of the workers and the country 
as a whole."

<F P=106> [Article by Khaled Melhaa: "Large GIA Network Discovered in </F>
France" -- first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] Less than six months after a spectacular round-up of 
FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] activists in France, the arrest on 
21 March of two Algerians, Ahmed Seba and El-Hadj Chaib Eddour, 
in the French city of Lille (Nord) has revived debate about the 
existence of European rear support bases for Islamist 
terrorism... 
  Paris -- Two thirtyish Algerians, presumed FIS sympathizers, 
who were arrested in Lille last Monday were formally charged on 
Friday evening with complicity in a terrorist plot and bound 
over by Parisian magistrate Jean Louis Bruguiere. The Algerians 
were in possession of an assault rifle and ammunition (not for 
the assault rifle), as well as tracts and false documents, it 
was learned from judicial branch sources. 
  We have also learned there is a lot more to the story than 
suggested by that terse 25 March dispatch: in fact, the 
discovery of the first GIA [Armed Islamic Group] in France. 
Disturbing and incredible as it may seem, no one--not the DST 
[Directorate of Territorial Security], the antiterrorist section 
of the Paris PJ [Judicial Police], the 6th Central Directorate 
of the Judicial Police [DCPJ] responsible for counterterrorism 
nationwide; not even the DGSE [General Directorate for External 
Security] or the Algerian intelligence services--knew of the 
existence of such a terrorist ring. Some time ago, on 9 November 
1993, 75 Islamists were arrested in various parts of France, 
among them prominent FIS leaders residing in France such as 
Moussa Kraouche and Djaafar El-Houari, leaders of the Algerian 
Fraternity in France (FAF), as well as Ahmed Simozrag, currently 
under house arrest, an attorney for FIS leaders incarcerated in 
Algiers. 
  The latter was the subject of an expulsion order signed by 
the Ministry of Interior on 9 November 1993. The decision to 
place him under house arrest was made after he refused to pick a 
destination country, Algeria for example. That police operation 
set off panic in Islamist circles in France, as well as a 
political and media outcry. French Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur said the day of the arrests that "the round-up of FIS 
leaders and sympathizers in France... should serve as a warning 
to all and sundry...that in France, everyone must obey the laws." 
  For his part, French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua issued 
a strong warning to Islamists that "the government will not 
tolerate the growth of subversive activity in France, under 
whatever pretext, and we will put an end to it." 
  Thus the French Government, which thought it had put the 
Islamist menace behind it, discovers now to its consternation 
that Islamist activists seem to have paid little heed to those 
warnings. But Islamists were already known to be implicated in 
various trafficking activities, including narcotics, that serve 
to finance activities of the terrorist groups in Algeria and in 
Europe. 
  This particular story goes back to December, when the 
investigative division of the police security branch [RG] in 
Paris and the Lille PJ began their separate sleuthing. The Paris 
RG was on the trail of a GIA support network, while the Lille PJ 
was investigating a heroin trafficking ring that was smuggling 4 
kg per month of the drug from the Netherlands into northern 
France. 
  On 21 March at about 1700, the PJ squad in Lille arrested 18 
members of the network, which had been using for its base of 
operations the "El Djazair" cafe, which was located at 15 Rue de 
la Cle in Lille's old town and owned by a 67-year-old Algerian, 
Mohamed Bougrioua. Forty-eight hours later, Mrs. Catherine 
Fontaine, examining magistrate with the Lille public 
prosecutor's office, signed committal orders for nine of those 
apprehended, including the cafe owner and Messrs. Adji, Djouab, 
and Amireche (aged 22, 24, and 30, respectively), on drug 
charges. 
  Hundreds of grams of heroin were seized in police searches 
that also brought to light links between the GIA network and a 
big criminal ring specializing in fabrication of forged Algerian 
identity documents. 
  Nine members of that ring had been arrested in a raid about 
twenty days earlier but were released for "lack of evidence." 
  The work of the investigative divisions of the RG in Paris 
and Nord led to the discovery of 511 blank Algerian national 
identity cards and 606 national service cards (bearing the stamp 
of the High Commissioner's National Service Office [HCSN]) at 
the Lille residence of a 39-year-old Algerian "student," El-Hadj 
Chaib Eddour. These ANP [People's National Army] documents had 
already been placed in envelopes bearing names and addresses of 
the intended recipients in Algeria. According to our sources, 
the list of these names was passed to Algerian authorities. Also 
arrested was Ahmed Seba, a 28-year-old Frenchman of Algerian 
origin. He quickly confessed and said he had been induced, by 
threats of reprisals against loved ones in France and Algeria, 
to deliver the documents to Chaib Eddour's domicile at the 
behest of one Chemellal Boudjellal, a GIA Islamist now a 
fugitive from justice. 
  Boudjellal, born in Mascara in November 1966, is also said 
to 
have given Ahmed Seba an assault rifle of Israeli manufacture 
(Galil) found during the search of the latter's domicile in 
Persant-Beaumont, on the northern outskirts of Paris; inspectors 
from the 6th DCPJ found munitions, plus--once again!--hundreds 
of blank Algerian identity cards and certificates issued by the 
army's HCSN. 
  Police also found GIA documents sent from London and 
addressed to one Aymar Elachir, various postal transfer 
documents, some cash, and rubber stamps bearing the name of an 
ANP officer. According to our sources, the false papers were 
intended for GIA members returning from Afghanistan and for 
elements of the same terrorist group in Algeria. 
  The search also turned up a connection between Ahmed Seba 
and 
Larbi Beddiaf, who was charged on 12 November with conspiring in 
a terrorist plot: A copy of the judicial order was found in 
Seba's residence in Persant-Beaumont. 
  This sweep was the largest ever mounted by French police 
against a "dormant network" of Islamist operatives in France. 
Ahmed Seba and Chaib Eddour--both unknown, we emphasize, to 
either French or Algerian security services--have been bound 
over by examining magistrate Jean Louis Bruguiere, who 
frequently handles terrorist cases. The two suspects were 
charged on 25 March with "conspiracy to engage in terrorist 
action, violation of the weapons laws, falsification of official 
documents, and utilization of falsified documents." An 
international look-out bulletin has been issued for Chemellal 
Boudjellal, who French police say is the "brains" behind the GIA 
in northern Europe. 
  Unlike the November police sweep against Islamists residing 
in France, this affair has been handled very quietly by French 
authorities. The new approach suggests that the implantation of 
Islamists in France and Europe may be more extensive than 
previously thought.

<F P=106> [Interview with Abdelhamid Benzine, editor of ALGER </F>
REPUBLICAIN, by Ghania Oukazi; place and date not given: "`The 
Future Belongs to the Forces of Progress'"; first paragraph is 
EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] Between the barbarity of terrorism and the 
decay of the government, the Algerian press is now being called 
upon more than ever to fight to safeguard freedom of expression. 
Expression that must be modern and democratic. Abdelhamid 
Benzine, a militant from the beginning and now editor of ALGER 
REPUBLICAIN, was kind enough to give us his impressions 
regarding that established fact. 
  [Oukazi] Could you talk to us about the current situation in 
the national press? 
  [Benzine] The media landscape has become very diversified in 
recent years. And what amazes me today is the publications that 
have recently come into being while others that were already in 
existence are suffering from a lack of funds and experiencing 
big problems with the printing and distribution companies. As 
far as ethics are concerned, things have progressed 
considerably. I would like to take this opportunity to pay 
tribute to all the martyrs: all the colleagues who have been 
killed and those struggling against death. 
  As far as we are concerned, I would like to point out that 
we 
still have not heard from our reporter who was kidnapped several 
days ago. That being said, the press, generally speaking, is the 
prime expression of democracy. Terrorist harassment is engaged 
in precisely in order to halt that expression. We should point 
out that today's press is playing a prime role beyond the limits 
of its true role because of the political vacuum elsewhere. 
Party activity has recently been reduced to faxes published by 
the press. 
  [Oukazi] Today's press is caught in the cross fire between a 
government that is watching for it to make the slightest false 
move and the criminal assaults by barbaric terrorism. How do you 
see the situation in those terms? 
  [Benzine] The state is decaying, and the government is not 
homogeneous. 
  As regards journalists, they have practically ceased to be 
what used to be called the fourth estate. They are playing the 
prime role in self-defense; they are in the vanguard. 
  That being said, we must not generalize. There are 
journalists who are democratic republicans and bearers of 
modernity, and they are fighting for a democratic people's 
republic of Algeria--for respect for every individual and 
collective freedom--and then there are opportunistic journalists 
who are marketing men much more than they are fighters. One 
cannot cheat and say that information is neutral and objective. 
We all engage in ideology whether we realize it or not. 
  [Oukazi] How do you see the struggle that journalists must 
engage in today? 
  [Benzine] First of all, they must organize themselves. It 
will also be necessary to combat elitism. It is necessary to 
improve information and training. I am against corporatism. For 
example, I would not be in an organization that had 
fundamentalist journalists. I am in favor of an organization 
that respects the Constitution, the republic, and democracy and 
does not work for the implementation of shari'ah and then "an 
Islamic regime." Things must be clear. 
  Moreover, I am in favor of dialogue among the democratic 
forces and not with fascism. Fundamentalism is nothing but a 
variation on archaic fascism, because fascism under Mussolini or 
Hitler was modern. For its part, fundamentalism is worse than 
that. 
  So journalists must organize among themselves to improve 
their profession, information, and its guiding principles. At 
the same time, they must become integrated with a much more vast 
movement that must be republican, democratic, and oriented 
toward social progress. 
  It is also necessary that there be solidarity among them. In 
all modesty, and also without false modesty, journalists must 
take their place in the fight to safeguard the country. I also 
believe that what has been done so far is better than nothing 
but that we are far from hitting the mark. Above all, it will be 
necessary for young people, who are more in tune with the times 
and more dynamic, to become imbued with this fight. 
  [Oukazi] How do you see the country's future? 
  [Benzine] There are two ways of looking at the future. One 
is 
a little narrow and, I would say, selfish, since it consists of 
seeing things from the standpoint of one's own life. Obviously, 
things are disturbing. 
  The future two, three, or four years from now will be very 
hard. It is up to all patriots to fight to overcome the crisis. 
Since that is a matter of individual conscience, we must have no 
illusions, but we are still going to have a rough time of it. 
But from the longer perspective of history, I am optimistic. You 
know, just before the outbreak of the revolution in 1954, 
circumstances were different, but the crisis was just as 
serious. There were 22 people who had no support in society but 
who were aware that underneath the ashes were the embers that 
would burst into flame. 
  Today I am convinced that the martyrs for freedom will not 
have died in vain. I am totally confident of that even though I 
know that nothing is inevitable in history. This is not 
optimism, but I am convinced that Algeria will emerge from this 
crisis and be stronger because of this experience. 
  It is a matter of building a better world. We must be 
realistic, look at things calmly, and struggle. 
  We must not give in to fascism. Sometimes we win and 
sometimes we lose because the struggle does not proceed in a 
straight line. 
  But we must lead people to the certainty that the future 
belongs to the forces of progress.

<F P=106> [Article by Karima Goulmamine: "Where Is the State?"; first </F>
paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] This time, for once, the women had an hour of 
freedom of expression in front of Ibn Khaldoun Hall. It happened 
yesterday. 
  This 8 March (International Women's Day), Algerian women 
rejecting fundamentalism and fanaticism answered the call by the 
Rally of Algerian Women for Democracy (RAFD) to challenge the 
state and remind it of its mission. Cries reflecting pain, 
anger, protest, and above all the attitude that: "I have had it 
up to here" were heard as the women expressed their deepest 
feelings. 
  Their number included women who had lost their husbands, 
brothers, or friends. 
  The family of the martyrs of hate-blinded terrorism was 
there 
to try to save what was left. But it must be said that 8 March 
in this year of 1994 was different. There were no longer any of 
the customary demonstrations or marches through the streets of 
the capital. 
  This time, for once, the women had an hour of freedom of 
expression in front of Ibn Khaldoun Hall. Blocking all traffic 
so they could chant their slogans: "Where, where is the 
government?," "No to Djaballah" [Islamic Renaissance Movement 
leader], "No to Nahnah," and "No dialogue with the murderers who 
think they are war veterans." 
  Those expressions had to be sincere because they came from 
women acquainted with suffering: the wives of Liabes and 
Djillali Belkhenchir. In the eyes of all women who are 
determined when it comes to defending human rights, the state 
must react so that blood will stop flowing and so that 8 March 
will remain eternal. 
  In a letter sent by them to Liamine Zeroual, they challenge 
him, saying that women refuse to be sacrificed once again on the 
altar of a suicidal policy or of dialogue based on horse 
trading. "Yes, Mr. President, the bloodthirsty sect is 
continuing to bleed Algeria on this 8 March, the eve of Aid el 
Fitr." 
  "Mr. President, genuine dialogue regarding the modern future 
of Algeria must include the women and men who believe in it and 
who are trying every day to protect this country from an Islamic 
diktat." 
  In a separate development, the Socialist Forces Front (FFS) 
says in a statement that women are fervent fighters for human 
rights. It makes a most alarming observation, however. It says 
that in all the confusion, women are powerless witnesses to the 
tragedies that are occurring, being held hostage between 
terrorism and institutional violence, to which are added the 
sufferings of everyday life. 
  It also mentions the absence of any official text to provide 
security and protection for women, who continue to be the 
victims of obscurantism and illiteracy. It also points out that 
no mention is being made of the ardently demanded suppression of 
exclusionary laws, including, among others, the Family Code. The 
date of 8 March used to be a kind of holiday on which women 
could review the progress made and call for more. Women are now 
reduced to asking for the most basic right: the right to live.

<F P=106> [Article by A.K.: "The Solution Today"; first paragraph is </F>
LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] After more than a week, a strike by dock 
warehouse personnel still has activity at the port paralyzed. 
The parties to the dispute are meeting today. 
  Because of the absence of a minimum amount of service, 
several ships carrying semolina, flour, rice, and other food 
products have been waiting for days in hope of being unloaded, 
while other freighters are simply switching ports (and going to 
Mostaganem or Oran). The situation is causing the loss of an 
estimated 60 million centimes per day. 
  The dockworkers are expressing their dissatisfaction with 
implementation of a traffic plan established by the port 
authority and stipulating where the various categories of 
personnel will enter the port. In accordance with that plan, it 
was decided on 9 October 1993 that dockworkers and day workers 
would not be allowed to enter through the main gate. Gate 17 was 
fitted out especially for them. When contacted by us, the port's 
general director, Boumessila, said that "the dockworkers have 
launched an illegal and unexpected strike without submitting a 
list of demands or undertaking negotiations with the management." 
  For his part, Abdellah Redjadj, a member of the local union, 
said in the columns of ALGER REPUBLICAIN that the dockworkers 
were not on strike: "We come here every day to work, but they 
deny us access." He was referring to the main gate, where 
"everybody except us goes in." Consequently, they are refusing 
to go through Gate 17, which they say is dangerous: "That is 
where the trucks and the train enter." Redjadj also mentioned 
their chief demands, namely the opening of the main gate, pay 
for the days on strike, and a halt to the threats and acts of 
intimidation to which the dockworkers have been subjected. The 
meeting scheduled for today between the Labor Inspectorate, the 
local union, and the port authority should result in a quick 
solution to this problem, which has brought one of Algeria's 
biggest port enterprises to a standstill.

<F P=106> [Article by S.B.: "Tiaret: A Hostage City"] </F>
  [Text] Tiaret is still living in anguish. The city 
closes the curtains at 1800. 
  "It is the curfew of fear!" we were told by one young Tiaret 
resident who can no longer bear to live in a region whose 
residents easily give way to panic and lose their heads at the 
slightest rumor. "You would think we had no more men in Tiaret," 
he added, seemingly disgusted by the passive attitude of the 
citizens and especially the laxness of the local authorities, 
who do nothing to reassure people and provide them with a 
climate of confidence. 
  Reports from Tiaret give one the impression that there is no 
more state presence in that city, since it seems to have been 
abandoned to the fundamentalist terror that is continuing its 
insidious undermining work. Objective: to subject the citizens 
to the diktat of the terrorists so as to prove that the latter 
are stronger than the state. Here, too, the "words of command" 
that one hears are the same as those heard just about everywhere 
else: the veil must be worn, hairdressing shops for women, video 
stores, and the few bars still open must be closed, and 
parabolic antennas must be taken down. 
  The fundamentalists operate by means of large-scale 
propaganda, the arrogant presence of bearded men, racketeers, 
and death threats sent by letter and addressed collectively or 
individually. Besides that climate of terror being maintained by 
"henchmen" working at various levels, we were told of the 
existence of fake mobile roadblocks being set up by terrorists 
on the roads leading to Tiaret from Theniet El-Had, Frenda, and 
Zemmoura. 
  "The terrorists have taken over Tiaret, and I can tell you 
that former prisoners from Ain M'Guel are their main henchmen 
for terror. They move around the city with an arrogance that is 
effective," we were told by another young man from Tiaret. 
  According to another source, the fundamentalists hold 
frequent meetings in mosques. They inventory the property of the 
rich with a view to expropriating it. That news has reportedly 
caused many of the city's notables to flee. The fundamentalists 
are able to build their pressure because of submission by the 
citizens. The more afraid Tiaret's residents become, the more 
they give ground to the "bearded ones" who want to rule over the 
life of the city with their prohibitions. That is what interests 
them the most about the "hogra" [scorn, contempt] of women. 
  So is the situation desperate? "Not at all," comes the 
answer, "because there are still many citizens who resist and 
reject the lifestyle the fundamentalists are trying to impose on 
them." 
  In that connection, the demonstration held on the day of the 
funeral of the DEC [expansion not given], who was killed in his 
office in cowardly fashion, was a popular demonstration of that 
rejection. 
  The man was highly regarded, and Tiaret's residents, both 
men 
and women, wanted to shout their anger at a gang of criminals 
that lives on murder and sabotage. The citizens say: "The city 
must wake up and get back to its normal life. People have had 
enough of this terror and are ready to fight, but for them to do 
that, the authorities must not let them down."

<F P=106> [Article by A. Boumaza: "Strike in Guelma"] </F>
  [Text] Interurban transportation in the Guelma Governorate 
is being quite seriously disrupted, not to say paralyzed, by a 
strike that was started on 25 March--the day before the 
resumption of classes--by private carriers, who carry over 50 
percent of the traffic. 
  In their strike notice dated 22 March, the 43 carriers 
affiliated with or belonging to the UGCAA [General Union of 
Algerian Merchants and Artisans] (32 out of a total of 68, 
according to the governorate's Directorate of Transportation) 
are demanding that individual fares be raised following the 
recent increases in fuel prices. 
  In fact, several of them had been working since 16 March 
with 
a new fare schedule instituted by them. A copy of the new 
schedule was submitted to the Directorate of Transportation, but 
the latter did not give its approval. Result: about 10 of the 
carriers had their operating permits revoked. 
  The Directorate of Transportation says, with proof to back 
it 
up, that "their demands have been sent to the supervising 
ministry, so there is no reason to stop work and violate their 
moral contract, especially in this period when we are 
experiencing crises of all kinds." 
  By means of this "unlimited strike," the private carriers in 
Guelma are reacting to the new increases in fuel prices, and 
they have decided to keep their buses stopped until their 
demands are met because "operating costs are becoming very 
high," they explain. Last, and as always, it is the citizens, 
most of them students, who are paying for the strike while 
waiting to pay the price of a ticket, which is certainly going 
to rise.

<F P=106> [Article by Zoubir Ferroukhi: "Truth in Prices Has Started!"] </F>
  [Text] The sudden increase in the price of fuel, tobacco, 
and matches will certainly trigger a movement of revolt and 
indignation among motorists and smokers, but the most surprising 
thing, no doubt, is that those price increases occurred long 
after the budget went into effect. 
  That is one thing. As it happens, two theories can be 
considered. Either the increases were included in the budget, in 
which case the chapter on that subject was not visible to 
everyone. Or they reflected a decision anticipated by the 
government outside the strict framework of the budget. For 
another thing, it is undeniable that the system of transparence 
is still far from being the main concern of our decisionmakers. 
  There was nothing to prevent either of the firms involved in 
those increases from informing the consumer ahead of time and 
providing the necessary explanations rather than suddenly 
slapping him with higher prices--which they did, moreover, with 
very poor timing. It needs to be remembered, first of all, that 
as far as fuel prices are concerned, Naftal [National Enterprise 
for Refining and Distributing Petroleum Products] could not have 
made the decision itself, since those prices are regulated by 
the state. 
  Increases require an executive decree by the government, and 
that decree came early this week, followed by a letter from the 
Ministry of Commerce to Naftal asking the latter to raise its 
prices: to 8.50 dinars [DA] for premium gasoline, DA7 for 
regular, DA6 for fuel oil, and DA40 per bottle of butane 
(compared to DA30 previously). It will be noted that the 
sharpest increase involves fuel oil, and at Naftal headquarters 
yesterday, we were told that the charge for a 13-kg bottle of 
butane was still a long way from reflecting truth in prices. In 
the case of the other fuels as well, experts feel generally that 
current prices are too low, if only because fuel is considered a 
quality product. 
  The theory that what this involves is simply an effort to 
bail out the state budget and make up the deficit does not hold 
up. The budget deficit borders on DA120 billion, and it would be 
hard to swear that that amount could be adequately made up by 
this means. It is also out of the question that these increases 
were included in the budget. Whether they may have been included 
in a supplementary budget bill is another matter. The government 
therefore must have made the decision regarding the measures in 
question, probably with an eye to the political effect such as 
step would have in Washington, where a financial bailout for our 
country is being negotiated. 
  The gradual approach to truth in prices could be a sign 
intended for the IMF, which must see concrete evidence that the 
Algerian Government wants to pursue an austere and rigorous 
economic policy. The choice of fuels and cigarettes is probably 
not an accident. Because automobiles are considered a luxury in 
Algeria--partly because of the preoccupation with life's sordid 
aspects--and tobacco is a harmful product, the social effect of 
the increases is lessened. Other measures will follow, also with 
some flexibility, apparently, since some sources say that milk 
is going to cost DA5 and a loaf of bread DA2.50 after Aid el 
Fitr. That will not hit people's pocketbooks too hard. 
  As far as the unions are concerned, the higher price of fuel 
and tobacco is not overly disturbing the morale of the workers' 
representatives. "It does not bother us," is the response we got 
yesterday at the People's Center, where people are happy that 
the increases are not affecting staples. 
  It should be pointed out, however, that the price of fuel 
oil 
in particular is going to have an effect on bus and train fares 
and on other services where fuel oil is essential. But the 
toughest part may be still to come as far as the UGTA [General 
Union of Algerian Workers] is concerned, and the upcoming 
negotiations with the government are likely to be very stormy.

<F P=106> [Article by R. Remila: "What Strategy for the Postpetroleum </F>
Era?"] 
  [Text] What strategy should be adopted to activate the 
much-awaited trigger mechanism that will start a real and 
effective recovery of our economy? At the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs yesterday, Mustapha Mekideche, president of the Algerian 
Exporters Club (CEA), tried to provide a few answers to that 
question in a paper entitled: "Nonhydrocarbon Exports and 
Industrial Restructurings in Algeria: Stakes and Strategies." 
  The speaker said that regardless of the effects of the 
expected agreement with the IMF for dealing with the debt, 
overcoming the crisis in the Algerian economy will necessarily 
involve a qualitative change in the country's trade structure 
for the coming 10 years. 
  According to him, "that is the only step that will ensure 
Algeria of successful integration with the international 
division of labor--that is, the continuation of its economic and 
social development at a high and sustained rate of growth." 
  Mekideche also said it was now practically certain that 
hydrocarbon revenues for 1994--estimated at $8 billion--would 
not be enough to cover debt service. He explained: "Even the 
expected quantitative increase in hydrocarbon exports beginning 
in 1996 or 1997 will not be enough to satisfy our foreign 
exchange requirements." 
  He also said that petroleum taxes have so far accounted for 
two-thirds of the state's budget resources. 
  "Those resources," he said, "are going to decline 
significantly beginning in 1994, when the austere budget 
policies go into effect." 
  He added that the Algerian economy was facing financial 
challenges reflected in a double crisis: 
  The first is the crisis in its model for international 
integration, in that demand can no longer be financed, and the 
second is the crisis in its operating model, which is sustained 
administratively and geared to a protected domestic market--the 
source of unearned income and wasted factors of production. 
  What is at stake for the international community is the 
emergence of a successful and reliable Algerian economy in the 
flow of international, domestic, physical, and monetary trade. 
  So what strategies are possible for establishing a different 
and more efficient operating model? 
  According to Mekideche, that depends on the promotion of 
exports, but he points out that first, "it is necessary to 
reject the prejudice, which says that Algeria has nothing to 
export except hydrocarbons, because such a prejudice is actually 
aimed solely at keeping up the illusion of safeguarding an 
economy based on unearned income that is no longer capable of 
renewing itself according to the same pattern." 
  In the opinion of the CEA's president, the service sector 
appears to be the one most prepared for exports in the short 
term. The reason is that it is not much affected by variations 
in the allocation of foreign exchange and consumes little in the 
way of imported goods and services. Moreover, Algerian firms can 
be competitive in niches involving general infrastructures and 
public works and industrial and energy infrastructures. 
  The implementation of dynamic and innovative industrial 
policies remains the sine qua non if we are to breathe new life 
into the Algerian economy. 
  That strategy consists of "remodeling industrial branches 
and 
firms with a view to their rationalization so as to set up 
productive segments that are coherent, balanced, and 
profitable," a move that can generate "foreign exchange cash 
flow to help finance the overall growth of the economy." 
  The new industrial policy should make it possible to reduce 
the factors of national dependence, specialization, and 
integration, to abandon declining industries, and, lastly, to 
promote export industries.

<F P=106> [Article by A.A.: "Price Increases: Grumbling in Union </F>
Circles"] 
  [Text] Anger is brewing in union circles in 
reaction to the recent increases in the price of widely used 
consumer products. Expressing its surprise, the UGTA [General 
Union of Algerian Workers] Executive Board is threatening to 
take action. 
  In the fourth and last point made in a statement released 
yesterday, UGTA Secretary-General Benhamouda did not mince 
words: "The UGTA will use all the means in its possession, 
undertake all legal actions, and take all steps it considers 
necessary to defend the rights and interests of the workers and 
their families." 
  His rather harsh statement notes with "surprise" that "the 
recent increases...have plunged the workers and the public into 
confusion and worry, all the more since they were 
announced...just after the national secretariat's meeting with 
the head of the government," a meeting at which the national 
secretariat expressed "the union organization's opposition to 
the preceding decisions to raise the price of certain products, 
notably diesel oil, the negative consequences of which are 
inevitable in many sectors of the economy, especially 
transportation and agriculture." 
  Asserting that it "was not informed at any time or in any 
way 
of the successive increases ordered by the government, much less 
involved in them," the UGTA questions "the real timeliness and 
significance of the price-raising measures announced the day 
after the demonstration that was held on 22 March 1994 to 
protest terrorism and violence and demand the defense of 
Algeria, whose unity and existence are being threatened by 
forces hostile to our people." 
  The anger of the union officials is also expressed by the 
UGTA's National Federation of Public Works and Hydraulics 
(FNBTPH), which a few days ago held a meeting enlarged to 
include officials of the union councils in firms in that sector. 
The communique adopted at the conclusion of that open meeting 
expresses "surprise" and "calls on the government to reverse its 
decisions, which do not serve the interests of the country or 
the citizens." 
  The measures that have been adopted are not the only ones 
being challenged. Union officials also question the way in which 
the government went about adopting and announcing them. The 
UGTA's top official expresses surprise that the measures were 
announced immediately after the central union's "informal" 
meeting with the government while also pointing out very clearly 
that the UGTA had nothing to do with the decisions that were 
reached. 
  In other words, and this is the meaning of the message, the 
UGTA did not back the increases, as the timing of the 
announcement might lead one to think. For its part, the FNBTPH 
remarks ironically that public opinion was informed not through 
official channels but through "our respectable television."

<F P=106> [Article by 'Izzah 'Ali: "Major Role for Private Sector, </F>
Social Fund in Providing Jobs; Limited Number of Specialties to 
be Appointed in Governmental Services Agencies"] 
  [Text] Indicators of the 1994/95 development plan confirm 
that the private sector and the Social Fund will have the 
largest role in solving the problem of unemployed graduates and 
providing productive job opportunities for them. 
  The plan gives a new role to the Ministry of Insurance and 
Social Affairs with regard to absorbing part of the unemployment 
problem through productive family projects. The Ministry of 
Agriculture will also share in solving the problem of unemployed 
graduates, through conveying ownership of reclaimed land. 
  Indicators also confirm that the government's commitment to 
assigning graduates will be limited to appointing graduates of 
medical colleges and nursing institutions to the health sector, 
and graduates of teaching colleges and supplementary studies to 
the education sector. 
  A responsible source in the Ministry of Planning stated that 
the government's role in the coming plan is confined to 
appointing specific career specialties to serve directly in 
service areas. Its present role is to concentrate on indirectly 
increasing employment through encouraging the private sector, 
and on the role of the Social Fund to encourage small projects 
in cooperation with local administrative agencies and banks. 
  Moreover, the government intends to issue a number of 
administrative decrees, such as early out for retirement, 
encouraging departures, and offering loans for an indefinite 
period. 
  By establishing manufacturing training centers, the 
government is aiming at requalifying the work force and 
graduates, commensurate with labor market needs, either domestic 
or in the Arab countries. 
<H5>  Educated Unemployed </H5>
  'Usam Fahmi, head of the Central Office for Labor and Human 
Resources in the Ministry of Planning, confirmed that the 
state's plan to employ graduates is based on several studies 
that have been conducted recently by the Cabinet and the 
Ministry of Local Administration, in participation with the 
Ministry of Planning. Initial results make it clear that the 
largest percentage of unemployment is among the educated, while 
it is lower for the uneducated, since their jobs do not require 
specific qualifications and it is easier to go from one job to 
another. It is different for the educated, whether highly 
qualified, above average, or average. The number of unemployed 
graduates, during the period from 1983 to 1993, was about 1.425 
million out of a total of 3.438 million graduates. 
  In this study, conducted in 21 governorates--excluding the 
border governorates--it was noted that the highest percentage of 
educated unemployed was in Port Said, where it totaled 16.5 
percent, followed by Suez at 13.5 percent and Kafr al-Shaykh at 
11 percent. The Upper Egyptian governorates of Bani Suwayf, 
al-Minya, Asyut, and Aswan were 11.2 percent, 11.7 percent, 11.4 
percent, and 11.4 percent respectively. The unemployment rate 
was 10.9 percent in the governorate of al-Daqahliyah, 10.7 
percent in al-Sharqiyah, and 10 percent in al-Minufiyah. It 
dropped in al-Jizah, where it was less than 5.6 percent. 
  It was also clear that the highest unemployment rate was 
among 1992 graduates, totaling 12.4 percent, while the lowest 
rate was among 1983 graduates at 5.5 percent. 
  A study of unemployment distribution by skills showed that 
the highest rate was in the intermediate range, followed by 
above average and highly qualified. 
  With regard to graduates of average skills, the highest 
unemployment rate was for graduates of commercial institutes, 
representing 67.8 percent, followed by industrial school 
graduates at 28.7 percent, and social services at 1.5 percent. 
Agricultural school graduates were at 0.7 percent, hotel 
training 0.3 percent, and health technicians 0.2 percent. It was 
found that the highest unemployment rate for highly-skilled 
graduates, during the period from 1983 to 1993, was for 
graduates of the Business College, which was 34.6 percent, 
followed by graduates of fine arts colleges at 15.3 percent, and 
law and agriculture at 14.6 percent and 14.5 percent 
respectively. The lowest rate was for graduates of engineering 
colleges at 3.8 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Ahmad al-'Attar: "Investigation of Citizens' </F>
Complaints About Shoddy Goods; Actions Against Factory 
Violations Aimed at Stopping Production"] 
  [Text] There is no doubt that two agencies have an 
important role in the near future, especially with the 
application of free economic regulations and the increased role 
of competition in the Egyptian market. The Ministry of Industry 
has prepared a comprehensive plan, and the Board of Standards 
and the Industrial Regulatory Agency will take part in 
implementing this plan. The purpose is to protect the Egyptian 
consumer and assure production quality, in order to guarantee 
that all goods available in the Egyptian market are in 
compliance with specifications. Actions will be taken against 
companies and factories that produce goods that do not comply 
with specifications, and the rights of Egyptian consumers will 
be safeguarded. 
  Dr. Ibrahim Fawzi, the Minister of Industry and Mineral 
Resources, says that implementation of a comprehensive plan to 
protect the Egyptian consumer and assure production quality will 
begin in mid-April 1994. He added that the Ministry of Industry 
and its various agencies in the quality control field--the Board 
of Standards and Production Quality, and the Industrial 
Regulatory Agency--will participate in executing this plan. 
  Clearly, quality has become a basic element in the 
production 
process, especially with the application of free economic rules, 
marketing mechanisms, and the increased growth of private sector 
activity. Consequently, the importance of the role of 
competition among goods in the Egyptian market has increased. 
Minister Fawzi stressed that "we welcome honest competition. 
However, whenever it is not honest, if--for example--some 
merchants lower prices at the expense of quality, in order to 
increase the competitive possibilities of a specific product by 
illegal means, the role of specifications takes over. 
Specifications make clear the acceptable limits for the level of 
desired quality for each product." He added that if simple 
production defects are found in manufactured goods, that must be 
explained to the consumer and a distinction made between 
first-class and second-class goods. This can be done with regard 
to goods that are not connected to the citizens' health or 
safety, such as products of pottery and china for example, when 
the defect in its manufacturing is simple and would not affect 
the product's capability to perform its consumer function. 
  "As for goods dealing with the citizen's health and safety, 
their production specifications must be strictly adhered to. Any 
deviation from these specifications will result in speedy 
actions that could lead to production stoppage for the 
violators." He added that the Board of Standards' role will 
basically be to issue standardized specifications for products. 
"That will give assurances about the quality of goods entering 
the Egyptian market, both for goods manufactured locally or 
imported from abroad. This will result in stopping the 
importation of leftover and surplus goods and preventing 
attempts to bring them into the country, as if they were 
first-class goods for sale at lower prices, passing them off as 
products of a first-rate importer at a lower price than similar 
goods produced locally and with better quality." 
  The Minister of Industry stressed he will also be 
continuously supervising the issuance of specifications, through 
interaction with modern international developments and trends in 
the industrial arena. He added that the Board of Standards will 
issue compliance and quality seals. "Goods manufactured locally, 
as a condition for their circulation, must obtain the compliance 
seal. These products basically include goods related to 
citizens' security and health. The seal of compliance spells out 
the basic specifications required for the manufacture of these 
goods. 
  "There are also other products that should obtain the seal 
of 
excellence. This is optional for the factories and companies, 
which can ask that their products be given this symbol, after 
giving assurances that these products are superior and more than 
meet the minimum required specifications. 
  "The new system with regard to goods that obtain the seal of 
excellence includes the requirement to specify the advantages 
that these goods have, which lead to their obtaining that 
symbol. This gives the consumer an opportunity to learn about 
them and confirm their fulfillment of those advantages in a 
practical way. If any consumer finds a defect in the conditions 
set forth for these goods that are marked as quality products, 
he can submit a complaint. If he finds any product with defects, 
the buyer can also complain either to the Board of Standards, 
the Industrial Regulatory Agency, or the Ministry of Industry. 
They will contact the manufacturing plant or company and take 
the necessary actions to safeguard the consumer's rights." 
  Dr. Ibrahim Fawzi added that, if complaints occur regarding 
goods that do not meet specifications, the Industrial Regulatory 
Agency will take the required actions to confirm the complaints' 
accuracy. If that is confirmed, several agency experts will 
inspect the plant or company that produced this merchandise. 
That is done in complete cooperation and coordination with the 
Board of Standards. When defects in certain products are found, 
the required actions will be taken against the factories that 
produced these goods. This includes withdrawing the seal of 
compliance. This seal is a basic requirement for merchandising 
these products. This applies to goods for which this symbol is 
compulsory. The seal of excellence will also be withdrawn from 
any product that has obtained it, when it is proved that it 
violates specifications. The new system includes, for each 
specified period of time, lists of goods that have received 
seals of excellence and compliance, as well as products from 
which those symbols were withdrawn. Periodic inspections will 
also be made of products that have received the seal of 
excellence. Samples will be selected at random and tested to 
ensure they adhere to the required conditions. 
  The Minister of Industry stressed the importance of the 
Egyptian consumer's right to obtain quality goods. This is basic 
to the protection of the consumer and the quality of products. 
The Ministry of Industry and its specified agencies are ready to 
offer any assistance required by the consumer in this regard.

<F P=106> [Article by Madihah 'Azab] </F>
  [Text] AL-AKHBAR sought to determine what producers, 
investors, financiers, and economists think of the new Customs 
Tariff in an effort to clarify the issue. 
  'Ali Nijm, former governor of the Central Bank of Egypt, 
believes that the new customs tariff is not protectionist, which 
was a foregone conclusion once Egypt signed the GATT agreement 
whose implementation is overseen by the World Trade Organizaiton. 
  He said that it is common knowledge that the Organization 
seeks to fully liberalize the foreign trade of member states and 
that all countries are therefore proscribed from any 
protectionism (against imports), subsidies (of exports), or 
dumping (of their products in other markets). 
  In fact, liberalizing foreign trade carries with it several 
advantages that the richer big countries may enjoy ahead of the 
poorer ones. Those advantages provide wider opportunities for 
investment, for workers, and for profit. 
  "Despite the reservations we have about the new tariff, it 
is 
only fair to say that it was necessary in order to avoid 
isolating us from the rest of the 95 other countries of the 
world that signed the GATT agreement and allowed the exchange of 
foreign trade among them. 
  "On the other hand, since we are a developing nation, the 
government should have carefully and thoroughly scrutinized the 
tariff to preclude those distortions that gave less 
consideration to economic impact than to levies and boosting 
revenues. 
  "Before it directs Egyptian investors and producers to 
improve and boost production, the state must first use certain 
laws, and whatever strategies it deems suitable, to address 
businessmen's and investors' complaints about the new tariff's 
negatives, such as raising the levy on production requirements. 
Such a step would maximize positives and alleviate the impact of 
negatives." 
<H5>  Wanted: Egyptian ISO [International Standardization </H5>
Organization] 
  Dr. Ibrahim al-Siba'i, vice chancellor of Cairo University's 
College of Commerce, emphasizes that protection is lacking and 
says that "it is a mistake to believe that reducing customs 
tariffs does not remove the umbrella of protection from domestic 
industries. Whatever protection officials envisage is in the new 
tariff is passive and not positive. The government has reduced 
the fees on foreign competition at the same time it has imposed 
a levy on the production requirements of domestic industries. As 
if that wasn't enough, it levied other fees under different 
names in order to boost revenue returns and make up for lowering 
the customs duties. 
  "The government has forgotten, or has chosen to forget, that 
this would inevitably increase the cost of Egyptian products and 
consequently raise their price vis-a-vis foreign products in 
competition that is not at all fair, especially since most of 
our industries are in the infant stage and still need government 
support in the form of incentives that would help them improve 
quality. That is why Egyptian goods will not be able to 
persevere against their imported counterparts and will not be 
able to penetrate world markets by passing ISO's international 
standards of quality. 
  "The least the Egyptian government can do, in turn, is to 
insist on strict application of ISO standards for its imports 
and on not opening its markets to any product that does not meet 
those standards. Some of the Gulf countries have already done 
so." 
<H5>  A National Role, Absent </H5>
  Dr. Hasan Abu-Zayd, chairman of the Accounting Department at 
Cairo University's College of Commerce, says: "We lack a 
distinct course and a defined target. If there is a consensus 
that the objective is to improve the quality of Egyptian 
products and boost exports, where then is the national role 
performed by the government in order to realize that objective 
which, in itself, represents our salvation from all economic 
woes? 
  "The government has not made production requirements 
available at economic prices. Consequently, the new customs 
tariff did not remove production impediments. Recent customs 
modifications considered [treated] our national industries, most 
of which are still in their infancy, as if they were strong 
industries in no need for production requirements, and therefore 
considered them as finished products subject to duty in full. 
Only a few such requirements have been excepted, and the duty on 
them has actually been cut. But those reductions, unfortunately, 
are in form only and not in actuality since those few items have 
been made subject to additional fees under different tax 
categories. 
  "Most countries of the world protect their vital industries. 
Even America insisted that the GATT agreement cover its movie 
industry in order to ensure full protection for that industry. 
We are no less than those countries. 
  "The state must endeavor to supply production requirements 
at 
economic prices, to remove impediments to production, and to 
improve the investment climate in Egypt. Very briefly, it must 
provide for the Egyptian investor in our country the same 
conditions under which foreign investors operate in their own 
countries." 
  Investor Rida-Allah Hilmi (from Tenth of Ramadan City) also 
calls for comprehensive studies of each individual producer in 
order to identify its means of production. Lacking that, grave 
mixups would occur, as proved by the new tariff, and many 
production requirements would be treated as finished products 
subject to maximum duty. 
  He added: "We are not asking the impossible but we call for 
fairness...as most countries of the world do." 
<H5>  Between a Rock and a Hard Place </H5>
  General Salim Zaki (from Tenth of Ramadan City) said: "I was 
surprised to find the new tariff totally different from what 
officials, including the prime minister and the minister of 
finance, led us to expect. They said it would provide great 
reductions for all means of production, but we see no reductions 
at all. What we see is a bizarre approach to the means of 
production, which the tariff treats as finished products, rather 
than semi-manufactured raw materials. 
  "How, then, can officials expect us, as investors, to 
produce 
output of higher quality and lower price? The situation is very 
thorny, and we find ourselves between a rock and a hard place. 
Either we change our profession and activities from producers to 
merchants, or we close our factories in the face of the 
frightening losses that will accrue as a result of the latest 
customs modifications and seek another location that provides a 
better climate for investment." 
  Gen. Salim Zaki emphasizes that the situation is in urgent 
need of review and cannot tolerate a long wait, as officials are 
wont to do. "We must reduce the duty on the means of production 
in a real way that will enable investors to produce Egyptian 
products of high quality at a cheap price in order to enable us 
to compete with foreign products in a marketplace that has no 
mercy." 
  Chemist Lewis Bisharah says: "It is illogical for the new 
tariff to impose a 60-percent duty on the means of production 
required by local industries." (He was referring to the 
ready-made garment industry where the new tariff imposed duties 
of 60 percent on shoulder pads for mens and ladies suits, 
blouses, and mens belts, and of 40 percent on chest padding 
[hashawa al-sadr], and other items. 
  He emphasizes that this can only mean that prices of 
Egyptian 
products will be double those of their foreign counterparts and 
sometimes even more. He said: "How could the officials have 
overlooked that? If they consider the new tariff to be an 
inevitable step along the road, then we as investors see a need 
to follow this step with other urgent steps that take domestic 
industry into consideration and provide it with the means of 
protection...exactly as do other countries keen on providing 
better climates for investment until we reach the international 
level of customs duties that are paid by our investor 
counterparts in foreign countries." 
  Chemist Lewis Bisharah demands that spare parts be treated 
as 
machinery and equipment are treated and not as finished 
electrical products, because spare parts are as important as 
machinery and not less so. "How, then, can the new tariff 
subject them to higher duty than that imposed on tools and 
equipment? We are in urgent and pressing need for a reassessment 
and for solutions to all the problems generated by the new 
tariff."

<F P=106> [Article by 'Izzat 'Abd-al-Mun'im and Fatimah Mahmud Mahdi] </F>
  [Text] Every year, the State allocates millions for the 
Public Service Project despite its many negative aspects. In 
particular, the project fails to make good use of the inductees, 
assigning them to locations unbefitting their specialties. It 
is also deceptive and superficial and the graduates who run it 
lack conviction. A whole government agency was created to 
administer the project. A High Commission for Public Service 
under the chairmanship of the minister of social affairs has 
been formed of the undersecretaries of the Ministries of 
Planning and Local Administration, as well as of representatives 
of the Central Agency for Mobilization, the Supreme Council on 
Youths, and other agencies concerned with Community Service and 
with implementing Public Service Law in the districts and 
governorates. 
  Because Public Service is considered a "prerequisite" for 
employment, graduates view it as a year to waste for no purpose 
except to secure another job credential. Even though there have 
been calls to improve the project or abolish it altogether, and 
even though proposals have been submitted to that effect, 
nothing has changed and the project continues to exact funds and 
costs with no tangible benefit. 
  We solicited opinions from a group of female graduates who 
have been required to perform Public Service. 
  Suha Muwafi, BA in English Literature, said that "the 
newspapers reported that Public Service applications were being 
accepted for a limited period of time. I reported to the Public 
Service Bureau in my bailiwick where I was given an identity 
card and referred to their main office. I encountered several 
problems of red tape before I was assigned to a charitable 
health clinic. Such work, of course, does not fit in with my 
qualifications but, what can you do?" 
  She added that based on her experience, the year of public 
service should be considered as a year out of work. "I neither 
benefit my place of work nor do I benefit by it. It is my view 
that the system should be amended in order to match the 
assignment to the college major." 
  Ghadah Muhammad 'Ali, a College of Commerce graduate, who 
said that she was assigned to work at a cooperative society, 
described being in the service as a very difficult period and 
called for an amendment to the law that would help realize the 
purpose of the plan. 
  Muna Sayyid Muhammad, BS, advocated termination of "this 
system which lacks any redeeming value." 
  'Afaf Yusif, BA in history, pointed out that she was taken 
by 
surprise after she was drafted when her period of service was 
extended an extra month because she never reported to the Public 
Service Bureau to collect her remuneration of four pounds. Her 
failure to do so meant an extra month of service. 
  'Ubayr Hamdi, a law school graduate, demanded that the plan 
be rendered voluntary and not compulsory. She said that she 
secured an exemption from public service because it would have 
meant the loss of a suitable job opportunity at an attractive 
salary. 
  Suhayr Husayn, a 1993 Commerce graduate, added that she has 
no desire to do public service work because her friends have 
told her many stories that discourage any such inclination. She 
said that she would seek an exemption, which she heard could be 
obtained by submitting a request to the Ministry of Social 
Affairs. The ministry no longer makes things difficult and 
readily agrees to grant exemptions in order to save the funds it 
pays female graduates for going into service. She called for 
abrogating the project. 
<H5>  No Discernible Value </H5>
  'Alya' 'Abd-al-Mun'im, BA, said that her service at a 
cooperative society was incompatible with her degree. She 
believes that the service has no discernible value and merely 
delays female graduates from realizing their aspirations. 
  Classmate Wafa' Mustafa, with a degree in literature, added 
that people in service do not get paid enough to cover their 
cost of transportation to their places of work, and public 
service therefore imposes an additional financial burden on 
women graduates, who must pledge in writing not to accept other 
employment when in public service. 
  Hanan Radwan, BA in Arabic literature, said that she was 
performing public service at a charitable health facility, even 
though the assignment is a hardship on her family. She is 
married and has a child that must be looked after. Serving at a 
charitable clinic means working a night shift that sometimes 
extends to midnight, making it difficult for her to perform her 
maternal duties. She added that she did not wish to perform 
public service, but had to because she would be required to 
produce service or exemption documentation before she can secure 
employment. 
  She said that exemptions could be secured through patronage, 
which she lacked, and consequently could not obtain the release. 
<H5>  Useful Projects </H5>
  Graduate Usamah Zuwayl advocates that the year of public 
service be spent on useful endeavors such as assigning a 
graduate to reclaim a tract of desert land which he or she would 
then get to own for a reasonable price. 
  Amal Fu'ad, a commerce graduate, said she was frustrated by 
mistreatment and repeated insults and threats by those in charge 
of the service who insisted that she do all the work. 
  Manal Hasan, BA in cooperative agribusiness sciences, 
believes that the existing public service system is a failure 
and pointed out that she gained no benefit or skill from her 
assignment, even though she is nearing the end of her term. She 
calls for amending the system and abolishing the prohibition on 
employment during the period of service, since it pays very 
little and is not considered a real job. She suggested that the 
skills of inductees be utilized in a manner that would increase 
productivity and therefore raise their income. 
<H5>  Dearth of Planning </H5>
  Thurayya Fahim, a public service specialist, believes that 
public service inductees are considered to be from the ranks of 
the unemployed and those to whom they are assigned sometimes 
refuse to allow them work. The solution would be for the female 
graduate to show up merely to sign in and no more. This reflects 
a lack of seriousness and control and the absence of necessary 
planning and coordination. Inductees are often assigned to 
locations teaming with employees without regard for major or 
field of study. 
<H5>  Patriotic Duty </H5>
  Dr. Ahmad 'Umar Hashim is vice chancellor of al-Azhar 
University and chairman of the People's Assembly's Religious 
Committee--one of the committees that debated the public service 
issue. He believes that "public service is required of every 
citizen, be he an employed youth or otherwise, since it is a 
patriotic duty. The Service should focus, in my opinion, on the 
fields of health, public safety, social work, and rural 
development. These, as well as the eradication of illiteracy, 
are areas where public service could play an important role, 
provided that they are fruitful and of benefit to society." 
  When we asked for comments on the manner in which public 
service is being implemented, Mr. Sayyid 'Abd-al-Hadi, director 
of the Public Service Administration at the Ministry of Social 
Affairs, first requested the permission of ministry officials 
then begged off after those officials refused to allow him to 
talk. 
  The question we now pose to Dr. Amal 'Uthman, minister of 
insurance and social affairs, is why all this secrecy about 
ministry operations, which are for the most part social in 
nature? Experts with specialized national councils point at a 
number of negatives and impediments that surfaced with the field 
implementation of public service. Most significant among those 
is that local public service committees in the governorates are 
not serious enough and therefore are not implementing the plan 
with the required integrity. In most cases, the authorities do 
not control the inductees, making them carry out their 
assignments with due diligence and, thereby, properly utilizing 
their energies and contributions. Then there is the problem of 
over-induction in certain governorates, but not in those most in 
need. Cairo, Alexandria, and al-Jizah governorates account for 
nearly 60 percent of all inductees, but this ratio drops to 3.2 
percent in al-Minya, 2.3 percent in Asyut, and 1.2 percent in 
Suhaj[this one is correct, I know that this has been spelled a 
million ways, but go with this one], which is one of the most 
densely populated governorates of Upper Egypt. Isma'iliyah 
governorate accounts for only 0.8 percent of, Suez for 0.6 
percent, and Matruh for 0.1 percent. 
  Experts point a finger at the lack of funds to remunerate 
inductees and issue them incentives, at insufficient allocations 
for athletic and social activities, and at inadequate 
appropriations for training and for incentives to Public Service 
Administration workers. 
  Public service agencies also suffer from not having defined 
their needs of inductees, forcing them to mete out assignments 
without previous planning. The result is that some inductees 
complain of being assigned to units where they have no real 
work. Certain public service units complain of the overabundance 
of assigned inductees, while others suffer from dearth. 
<H5>  Evaluating the System </H5>
  The public service issue was studied by two commissions--one 
organized in 1978 by the Central Agency for Organization and 
Administration, and the other formed of the Committee for Social 
and Religious Affairs and Endowments and the bureaus of People's 
Assembly committees for Youth, Defense, National Security, 
National Mobilization, and Labor Force. Their purpose was to 
evaluate the Public Service system and identify the problems 
that prevent it from realizing its objectives. They set out to 
do that by evaluating the most important aspects of the Public 
Service system, such as those dealing with drafting and 
qualifying graduates, with working conditions at their places of 
assignment, their remuneration, and other matters relevant to 
identifying the extent to which units have need for, and benefit 
by, the inductees assigned to them. 
  Those studies, which included some field trips to the 
governorates of al-Minufiyah, Isma'iliyah, and Port Said, 
concluded that the Public Service System, as it now stands, is 
in need of improvement and enhancement. 
  Experts with specialized national councils proposed a link 
between the Public Service System and the placement of surplus 
graduates on the basis of their level of education. That would 
help utilize those with intermediate and higher education in 
areas and spheres that match their disciplines or in fields 
where society needs more workers than it can attract, such as 
police work, nursing, and teaching. The majority of inductees 
would be assigned to help in the eradication of illiteracy 
within the framework of a comprehensive national illiteracy 
eradication strategy that would be implemented over a specific 
period of time in cooperation with the Ministry of Education. 
<H5>  The Failure to Eradicate Illiteracy </H5>
  Ms. 'Inayat al-Fiqi, director of the Ministry of Education's 
General Administration for Adult Education and the Eradication 
of Illiteracy, spoke about the role of Public Service inductees 
in eradicating illiteracy, one which many believe could be 
fruitful. She said that Public Service inductees are accused of 
having a lack of seriousness about their work and of a lack of 
adequate commitment. "Consequently, we now exclude Public 
Service inductees from our illiteracy eradication programs. We 
used to seek their help in the past but that proved to be 
futile." 
<H5>  The Wrong Method </H5>
  Dr. Sawsan 'Uthman, dean of the Social Services Institute in 
Shubra, believes that the methodology of the Public Service 
draft is faulty and accomplishes no positive results. She 
proposed that public service "target once every year a specific 
national goal, much as China did for the eradication of 
illiteracy and Cuba did about the sugar crop. Public Service 
performance should be characterized as being diligent, and 
controls should be instituted to guarantee that goal. We find 
that 40 percent of public service inductees are exempted [from 
service] by the Minister of Social Affairs. Another 40 percent 
register on paper only. Those who actually go to work and 
produce account for no more than 10 percent." 
  Dr. 'Ali-al-Din Muhammad, the Institute's assistant dean, 
emphasized that planning is important, in order to identify 
those with more need for inductees and to ensure that the latter 
"are assigned in accordance with their fields of study because 
the current method of assignment simply turns them into idle 
capacity."

<F P=106> [Article by 'Imad Darwish] </F>
  [Text] With the rising role of the private sector in 
development, an increase in the hiring of Saudi workers is 
inevitable, in line with the role assigned to the private sector 
in the scheme of the gross national product. It is a strategic 
goal restated by the fifth and sixth development plans. And yet 
has this strategic goal been achieved as it should be in the 
private sector? Governed by considerations of achieving balance 
between the greatest possible return, and lowest possible cost, 
and it is seen that foreign labor is cheaper, making it possible 
to achieve the desired return. [sentence as published] So, what 
are the ways of increasing Saudization in the private sector? 
How can trained Saudi labor be provided to meet businessmen's 
requirements? 
  From Mr. Salih al-Tu'aymi, secretary general of the Riyadh 
Chamber of Commerce, who polled businessmen and relevant 
officials in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labor 
and Social Affairs, we find that there are three basic 
indicators. These are: the continuation by the private sector to 
meet its labor needs from sources that provide the greatest 
possible profit, which is the labor that offers lower wages and 
high qualifications. The other view is that the private sector 
should be directed to fill its labor needs from the local 
market, in order to provide more economic stability, to raise 
the rate of working capital formation, and the participation of 
the private sector in developing the abilities of Saudi Arabia's 
human resources by giving them the chance to learn necessary 
skills. The third view involves the preparation of a timetable 
overseeing the readiness of the local labor market to assess how 
well it is meeting the needs of the private sector. It views the 
private sector as the most important sector for absorbing 
civilian labor in the Kingdom. The timetable would set out 
deadlines for all quarters affected by this issue, in both the 
private sector and government agencies. 
<H5>  National Demand </H5>
  Al-Tu'aymi restated the goals of the successive five-year 
development plans in terms of human resource development--the 
Saudization of jobs by finding work for every able citizen, by 
which palpable successes may be achieved in the government 
sectors and some private sector institutions. The state has 
understood since the beginning of the development process that, 
while the importation of expatriate labor brings some economic 
benefits, the Saudization of available positions is a mandatory 
national demand that must be fulfilled, working with the 
limitation that there are not an abundance of qualified national 
workers. 
  The balance is one of costs and benefits, and the 
interrelation of economic, social, and political factors in 
defining the nature of the labor problem in the Saudi economy. 
That is, the state desires action larger than the capacity of 
the local market to supply the local needs, so it is necessary 
to bring in tens of thousands of expatriate workers to fill the 
gap between developmental needs for manpower and local manpower 
supply. This has imposed a delicate balance of the benefits 
obtainable through the use of national versus expatriate labor, 
defining the cost involved in hiring, and studying the needed 
profitability on the part of government institutions and the 
national economy. The determination of benefits and 
profitability is of costs at the private company level, for both 
local and imported labor. The decision to employ either one in 
an activity may be positive or negative, in the sense that a 
purely commercial measure as a basis of computing this factor is 
inaccurate if it does not take sufficiently into consideration 
the indirect effects of making a hiring decision. A 
businessman anticipates revenue from hiring a worker. The 
accounting produces a result in favor of expatriate labor, with 
the hiring company getting a profitability it would be difficult 
to achieve using local labor, given the open market, low customs 
fees, and the low wage level acceptable to imported workers, 
compared with what a national worker would accept. The use of 
imported labor is in line with company needs (profession, 
expertise, qualifications) and is not contracted unless the 
needed skills are offered. This leads to the expatriate worker 
being assimilated directly into the institutional activity. 
There is no training or familiarization period. In addition, an 
expatriate employee will accept a job any place in the Kingdom; 
this is not the case with a native employee, who prefers settled 
work. There is also a relative weakness in native workers' job 
stability: he is always looking for an opportunity for a pay 
raise, promotion, and better working conditions. And expatriate 
laborer can be obtained in the numbers and types needed for 
company activity more quickly than national labor can be. This 
is because trained labor is available whenever it is sought. 
  Among the other factors that turned up in the Riyadh 
Chamber's questionnaire were the ease of getting rid of 
expatriate labor, should there be a drop in their level of 
performance, and the fact that the proprieter must pay 
installments of his share of the Saudi workers' social 
insurance. Furthermore, a Saudi worker may bother him during the 
whole workday, leaving the promotion process up to the private 
business owner. 
<H5>  National Benefits </H5>
  In spite of these factors, the hiring of Saudi workers 
brings 
national benefits that exceed the cost of employing them, and 
which make them more economically profitable than hiring 
expatriate workers. One of these points is stability in economic 
activity, as these activities are based on workers who are not 
affected by changes in the Kingdom's labor market due to 
developments occurring in the home countries of expatriate 
workers, such as bans or limits on the movement of workers, or 
the existence of more attractive job opportunities for them. 
  By hiring expatriate workers, the Saudi economy bears 
indirect burdens, such as the financial remittances that these 
workers send back to their countries, with the volume of these 
remittances corresponding to the difference between the income 
of these workers and their consumption, which usually is in line 
with their level of consumption in their home countries. This 
situation creates an increase in the Saudi riyal supply versus 
free currencies. This may affect the exchange rate between the 
riyal and those currencies, and of course this corresponds to 
the extent of the drain on the Saudi economy with the expansion 
in the hiring of expatriate labor. As to the growth in use of 
national labor, the development benefits within the Saudi 
economy will increase in a self-sustaining way, with the capital 
accumulation it brings. 
  The increase in importing expatriate labor leads to Saudi 
workers being deprived of the chance to learn the technical 
skills necessary to the continued expansion of the development 
process, as the national economy is deprived of the expertise 
that is compounded in the course of this process, when the 
expatriate workers return home. 
  Improving the financial circumstances of Saudi consumers 
permits them to reduce a better part of the course of the 
national economy's financial outflows, and its stability. 
  [Hiring Saudis] safeguards the values, customs, and 
traditions of Saudi society that stem from Islamic law, while 
expatriate workers come from many diverse--and 
non-Arab--sources. 
<H5>  Strategy of Replacement </H5>
  The fifth development plan emphasized the replacement of 
expatriate labor with Saudi labor to an extent greater than 
finding new job opportunities; the plan aimed to orient 220,400 
workers with the goal of replacement, representing 50.8 percent 
of total Saudi labor with the chance of increasing it over the 
years covered by the plan, versus 213,500 employed workers with 
new job opportunities, representing 49.2 percent of the same 
total. The plan included the orienting of a higher percentage of 
new Saudi workers, destined for clerical affairs; the campaign 
of target workers in this activity reached 119,300 workers, with 
a 27.5 percent of the total target increase in workers in the 
plan's time period, against a goal of orienting 59.1 percent of 
the workers in various productive sectors, with 13.6 percent of 
this increase. The plan aimed at reducing agricultural labor by 
25.1 percent, representing 5.5 percent of total workers 
employed, despite the increased importance of agricultural 
activity and its role in driving the development process, both 
in terms of other productive sectors and of the national 
economy. Figures showed a 13.9 percent reduction in technical 
and vocational labor in the total labor picture. This figure 
does not include the number of Saudis expected to be hired out 
of technical, training, and vocational institutes, though one 
may remark here that university graduates represent 12 percent 
of labor targeted for increase over the years covered by the 
plan, as against 15.7 percent of workers pre-elementary level 
and 22.1 percent of workers with certificates of completion of 
the elementary level only. It may be noted that the five-year 
plan's estimates could result from a base anticipation of 
218,700 workers entering the private sector, who left schools 
the intermediate level, representing 50.4 percent of total 
targeted labor, with regard to the schools run by the Ministry 
of Education and the General Directorate for Women's Education. 
  Addressing the size of the problem, we must point out the 
inactive surplus of workers in the Kingdom. These workers 
represent a demand for work in government agencies and the 
private sector. The five-year plan anticipated an increase of 
334,900 Saudi workers over the five years, of which 220,400 
would replace expatriate workers, who number 173,500, a net 
increase over the work force. That is an average level of 
86,700, 41,000, amd 42,700 workers respectively, of which the 
private sector would absorb 47,000 in the period 1988-1991, at 
an annual average of 18,500. This would be the annual average 
surplus of Saudi labor, 68,300 workers, with government agencies 
absorbing an average of 8,300 workers per year. 
  According to the study made by the Riyadh Chamber of 
Commerce 
and Industry, an average of 12,000 workers annually get jobs in 
the private sector through employment offices. This is an 
average annual increase in new private firms, with an annual 
average labor surplus of 48,000. This does not generally mean a 
problem for the Saudi economy, given the private job 
opportunities available to some, who prefer voluntary 
unemployment, and others, who work in non-civilian sectors. 
<H5>  Linking Loans to Saudization </H5>
  To encourage the private sector to hire Saudis, Dr. Sayyid 
Fathi al-Khuli, Professor of Economics at King 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
University, in a study of the private sector's actual manpower 
needs, emphasized that vocational and technical training 
institutes should graduate the kinds of workers the private 
sector actually needs. He also proposed linking the government's 
agricultural and industrial loans to the private sector to an 
actual commitment on the part of the borrowers to have no less 
than 10-percent Saudi employees. And this percentage would 
gradually rise. He supported the preparation of a field study to 
find the reasons for Saudi youth's aversion to private sector 
work, and the real reasons for the private sector's aversion to 
hiring Saudi workers; and in the light of these studies, 
appropriate solutions would be found. 
  Prof. Ibrahim Kamal, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in 
al-Ta'if, is of the opinion that Saudi youth are responsible and 
capable of work in various trades. In recent years, he said, 
numerous classes have graduated from the training centers and 
industrial institutes. They have been trained in the most modern 
systems and methods. This highlighted the role of the Council of 
Saudi Chambers of Commerce in perceiving the private sector's 
actual needs for Saudi labor, and in organizing training 
courses, both in terms of direct hiring and prior training based 
on studies of the labor market's actual need. 
<H5>  Rise in Local Workers </H5>
  Turning to the subject of the extent of the private sector's 
dependence on imported labor, the economic study prepared by the 
Riyadh Chamber of Commerce made it clear that the number of 
Saudi workers in the private sector would not decrease over 
seven consecutive years. Expatriate labor, on the other hand, 
would decline, meaning an increase in Saudi labor in the private 
sector, from 16 percent in 1985 to 17.8 percent in 1989. 
  This increase has kept mounting in subequent years with the 
growing role of the private sector in development, and the 
government's increased attention--through government agencies 
and the Council of Saudi Chambers of Commerce--to supplying and 
training Saudi workers. 
<H5>  Detailed Calculations </H5>
  The Riyadh Chamber of Commerce study recommended that more 
attention be given to manpower research, by continuing to 
conduct regular censuses; detailed calculations, such as of 
workers in various activities; and their distribution in terms 
of job and nationality. It also recommended behavior studies in 
the labor market to find positive and negative aspects and deal 
with them; it recommended a study of habits and traditions that 
belittle the worth of manual labor, and an attempt to inculcate 
new concepts in our youth to accentuate the worth of manual 
labor in service to the nation. 
<H5>  Summary </H5>
  A sampling of opinions among the economists and field 
studies 
on ways of promoting Saudization led us to an important fact, 
which is that channels must be created for ongoing liaison 
between the private sector and Saudi manpower, through the 
Kingdom's chambers of commerce, to determine the actual needs of 
the national sector; plus the organization of training courses 
in line with market needs, and training workers for management; 
and directing youth to appropriate positions in line with actual 
needs. They also highlighted the importance of studying the 
labor market and its movements, watching for negative aspects 
from time to time; studying jobs to which Saudi youth have an 
aversion, in order to find solutions; finding ways to encourage 
the private sector to hire Saudis, such as linking loans to the 
degree to which private firms Saudize; and granting incentives 
in the form of reduced customs fees, charity, and income taxes 
for companies that achieve high degrees of Saudization. All of 
this must be achieved in the context of an integrated strategy 
with the specific goal of Saudization and the methods needed to 
meet this goal.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abdallah al-Dabbagh, secretary general of </F>
Saudi Council of Chambers of Commerce, by Ahmad Rashwan; place 
and date not given--first three paragraphs AL-ANBA' 
introduction] 
  [Text] Perhaps the major trait of the budgets of the GCC 
[Arab Gulf Cooperation Council] countries this year is their 
general trend toward decreases. This is seen as a realistic and 
wise step in adapting to the changes imposed by circumstances in 
the global oil market. 
  This is according to 'Abdallah Tahir al-Dabbagh, secretary 
general of the Council of Saudi Chambers, in a wide-ranging 
interview with AL-ANBA', in which he said that the world is 
today experiencing a period of enormous changes, which the 
economic managers of all the GCC countries are trying to grapple 
with. Their first priority is to maintain the strength of each 
country's national economy, and their continued growth, through 
local and foreign fiscal support and stability. The interview 
also includes an assessment of the joint economic course of the 
GCC states, from the signing of the unified economic agreement 
until the present. Al-Dabbagh said that, despite achievements at 
the economic level, there are some problems and difficulties 
that hamper the economic course. The interview touched on the 
GCC states' economic and trade relations with economic and 
global factors, the development of the dialogue with the United 
States, the European Community, and Japan, as well as the 
importance of the commercial arbitration center, which the 
Riyadh summit agreed to set up. He confirmed that this center 
would be basic support for the protection of GCC citizens' 
rights, and would conclude legal difficulties they face in 
foreign arbitration centers. 
  Al-Dabbagh also shed light on the economic reform measures 
that have been enacted in several Arab countries, and the extent 
of their involvement in promoting trade and investment 
cooperation among Arab countries, in addition to the biggest 
obstacles to investment that still exist in the region. 
  The text of the interview follows: 
  [Rashwan] How do you assess current economic conditions in 
the Gulf region? To what extent has the oil slump affected 
economic activity in the region in general? 
  [Al-Dabbagh] To start with, I must say that we are living in 
a period in which the world is experiencing enormous changes. So 
the economic managers in all the Gulf countries are eager to 
adapt to them in such a way as to maintain, first of all, the 
strength of the national economy in each of the Gulf states, and 
their continued growth, by supporting local and foreign fiscal 
stability. The first tool is the maintenance of the value of the 
currency of each country, and strengthening them, to handle the 
prices of foreign currencies; that would be a basic guarantee of 
the continuity of self-sustaining growth. 
  Naturally, the fall in oil revenues is having an effect on 
the economies of the region, but not to a very large extent; 
this is thanks to the Gulf states' policy during the years of 
high oil revenues of building an infrastructure, raising the 
citizens' standard of living, and raising the standard of public 
services, especially educational, health, and social services. 
This policy was a great success, as anyone who follows the 
renewal movement of the Gulf states can see. 
  The Gulf states also succeeded, in the same time period, in 
creating large financial reserves, easing the process of 
adapting the Gulf states' economic policies to the reality of 
reduced oil revenues. The governments have adopted wise fiscal 
policies to adapt the economy gradually to the new level of oil 
revenues. This can easily be seen in the development plans. 
<H5>  Wise and Realistic Decision </H5>
  [Rashwan] All the GCC state budgets announced cuts, as a 
result of many global factors. How can this be dealt with, in 
your view, in such a way as to maintain the energy of the 
development process? 
  [Al-Dabbagh] In the beginning, we may point out that the 
Gulf 
states who have announced their budgets so far are Saudi Arabia 
and the Sultanate of Oman. The budgets of the United Arab 
Emirates and Kuwait are in the final review phase. Whatever the 
position now on issuing GCC state budgets, the budgets' major 
trait is the general trend toward reduction. This may be seen as 
a realistic and wise measure, to adapt to changes abroad imposed 
by conditions in the global oil market. In any case, even if 
these budgets are being reduced, if we want to have a deeper and 
more comprehensive understanding of the meaning of these 
budgets, we must look beyond these numbers themselves, to the 
long-term meanings of a number of local and global indicators 
and data. If we look at the Saudi budget as a specimen of the 
GCC states' new budgets, we can say that this budget is 
excellent, given prevailing global conditions. This is because 
Saudi Arabia has not become a debtor nation, nor is it unable to 
meet its commitments; nor has it abandoned its large economic 
projects; nor has it taken other routes that might have led to 
doubts about the soundness of its economy. The decision to 
reduce government expenditure is only an unforeseen, stand-by 
measure in the Saudi economy; and it represents, in itself, a 
strength hidden inside the economy, whether in terms of 
allocating many government assets, or 
rationalization--especially after the Kingdom's success in 
creating and developing a national sector that is growing and 
maturing every year, in a way that has enabled it to play a 
leading role in stimulating the Saudi economy. This has led to 
the reduction in the importance of government spending in 
stimulating economic activity at the expense of that sector's 
investments. In another sense, government spending now 
represents just one factor--even if it is the most important 
one--of a group of factors affecting economic movement in the 
Kingdom and numerous other GCC states, too. 
<H5>  The Private Sector </H5>
  [Rashwan] How do you view the role of the private sector at 
this stage, with Saudi resources dwindling due to the drop in 
oil prices. More specifically, what is the role of the private 
sector at this stage? 
  [Al-Dabbagh] As a result of ongoing conditions in the world 
oil market, wise government policy has required us to adapt to 
the drop in oil prices. This is because oil revenues represent 
75 percent of the state's total public revenues, and as a 
result, state spending has declined 20 percent in the new 
budget. A realistic analysis of this decline is that, in the big 
picture, it is consistent with the course set out in the 
development strategy of the Kingdom's plan beginning with the 
sixth development plan (1415-1420 [1995-1200]), which strongly 
emphasized a clear policy opening the way for private sector 
initiatives in the areas of investment and financing. This is in 
line with the plan's intentions, and to a large extent opens the 
way for the private sector to have a leading, even a commanding 
role in the development process. So the decrease is not part of 
a deflationary policy aimed at lowering total spending in the 
capital economy; it is the expression of changing places between 
public spending and private spending. More specifically, it is 
an attempt to change places in development efforts with a 
partial transformation of the government's role in funding the 
development process, into a basic role of the national sector in 
the future. This would encourage one of the main items in the 
statement of the minister of Finance and National Economy: that 
the national sector maintain its effectiveness in developing the 
growth rates of the local product, despite the decline in oil 
revenues. This means that one may expect the drop in public 
spending to be compensated by an increase in private spending, 
or, more generally, to boost the role of the private sector in 
the development process, and its financing. 
<H5>  Achievements and Difficulties </H5>
  [Rashwan] How would you assess the joint economic course of 
the GCC states since the signing of the unified economic accord? 
  [Al-Dabbagh] Before answering this important question, I 
would like to say that, despite the short time that has elapsed 
since the formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council, its 
economic achievements are clear. Its efforts have made great 
strides on the road to economic integration, cooperation, and 
coordination, and this success has led to new effectiveness and 
increased success. 
  The GCC states' unified economic accord, with its policies 
and joint economic programs, has had many significant economic 
achievements. There are, as well, some problems in implementing 
the accord, which GCC leaders are acting to redress, in order to 
implement the accord implemented quickly. Perhaps the most 
significant economic achievements are: 
  First, in the area of economic citizenship and equality of 
treatment: 

  -  The natural and legal citizens of the GCC states are 
allowed to pursue most economic activities, with gradual 
equality with the citizens of the countries in which they engage 
in these activities. All professionals and most vocational 
workers, including consultants, may engage in their professions 
and vocations in the GCC states. They will be accorded the same 
treatment as the citizens of the host countries. This includes 
wholesale and retail merchants. 
  -  It gives the citizens of GCC states the right to obtain loans 
from banks and industrial funds. 
  -  It permits the citizens of GCC states to own land for 
residential purposes. 
  -  It accords all GCC citizens equality in tax treatment, the 
same 
as that of citizens in the host GCC-member country in which they 
are engaging in economic and investment activity. 
  -  It allows the citizens of GCC states to own shares in joint 
ventures and new companies active in various economic 
activities. 
  -  It achieves equality of treatment at the elementary, 
intermediate, and secondary levels of education, and seeks to 
achieve equality in university-level education and unification 
of procedures in academic degrees and elementary, intermediate, 
and secondary diplomas and certificates. In the same area, it 
was decided that the citizens of GCC states resident in or 
visiting any GCC state will receive equal treatment when going 
to health centers, clinics, and public hospitals. 
  -  Customs tariffs were voided for agricultural and livestock 
products, and natural resource and industrial products from 
national installations, as from March 1983. 
  -  Natural and legal [citizen] producers may export their 
products 
directly to another member country, with no need for a local 
agent. 
  -  In addition, production units will be allowed to open offices 
to promote their products and services to their customers with 
no need for a local agent. 
  -  In government projects and government purchasing, priority 
will 
be given to national products and products of national 
origin. 

    Finally, the necessary facilities will be offered to ships 
and boats owned by any of the member countries or their 
citizens, and they will receive treatment equal to that of a 
local ship. 
  Second: In the area of coordinating and unifying GCC states' 
policies: 

  -  Goals and policies of development plans: 
  -  A joint agricultural policy. 
  -  A unified industrial development strategy. 
  -  An oil lending system. 
  -  A regional emergency plan for petroleum products and their 
exchange among GCC states. 
  -  Goals and policies for negotiating with countries and 
economic 
blocs, in addition to a cultural development plan. 
  -  Policies and general principles for protecting the 
environment 
in GCC states. 
  -  A document on controls on foreign media. 
  -  A charter on media honor. 
  -  Unification of prices and fees on services, including 
fuels. 

    Third: the area of joint ventures and the establishment of 
joint institutions. This is an area in which the GCC states have 
enacted numerous laws and measures aimed at encouraging joint 
ventures, among them: 


    -  Regulations for coordinating the establishment of 
industrial projects and the establishment of a permanent 
committee for the encourgement of coordination in setting up 
projects, studying any problems faced by existing projects, and 
finding solutions for them. 
  -  Enacting a system for the joint protection of national 
products. 
  -  Adopting unified standards for major commodities. 
  -  Organizing annual commercial exhibitions to coincide with 
summit conferences. 
  -  Allowing citizens to own shares in some companies. 
  -  Establishing a permanent committee to encourage small 
industry. 

    Since the founding of the GCC, a number of joint 
institutions 
have been founded: the Gulf Investment Organziation, the GCC 
States Standards and Specifications Commission, the Technical 
Liaison Office, the GCC Program to Support Development in the 
Arab Countries, the Joint GCC Office with the International 
Civil Aviation Organization, and the GCC Center for the 
Protection of Intellectual Property. 
  Fourth: in the area of intensifying channels of contact and 
networking, we have seen: 

  -  The establishment of the Gulf Marketing Association, 
registered in Bahrain. 
  -  The High-Pressure Electrical Engineering Association, 
registered in Qatar. There are also joint programs and camps to 
foster youth-related, athletic, cultural, artistic, and theater 
encounters. 
  -  Regular meetings with chambers of commerce and industry to 
keep 
them informed of the GCC's economic decisions, and for them to 
discuss the formulas of decisions that affect them, listen to 
any complaints, and give their views on collective action. 

<H5>    Gulf Chambers </H5>
  [Rashwan] Will there be a role for the Gulf chambers to play 
in the future to increase cooperation and help achieve the stage 
of economic integration among the GCC states? 
  [Al-Dabbagh] Despite the GCC's economic achievements, there 
are still some problems and obstacles hindering the economic 
course. So there is an important kind of cooperation and 
coordination among the councils and federations of chambers of 
commerce in the GCC states. This cooperation and coordination is 
based on a partnership in solving the problems and obstacles 
that are hindering the economic course, so that the 
implementation experience does not hit stumbling blocks. The 
councils and federations are working on liaison, coordination, 
and cooperation among themselves in the area of consulting, 
exchanging views, arranging meetings and conferences, preparing 
joint studies in areas of economic activity, or through joint 
cooperation on service and productive projects to whose capital 
GCC businessmen can contribute. They are also simplifying the 
procedures for GCC businessmen engaging in commercial, 
industrial, and service activiities in other countries, all in 
accordance with the accord, and with the help of the federation 
of chambers of commerce. 
  Of course, the councils of Gulf chambers have an important 
role in the next phase, which will require the GCC states to 
face all the difficulties that stand in the way of implementing 
the unified economic accord, on the way to the point of economic 
integration among the Gulf states. 
<H5>  Arbitration Center </H5>
  [Rashwan] How do you view the importance of the Gulf 
commercial arbitration center the Riyadh summit decided to 
establish? 
  [Al-Dabbagh] The decision of the recent Riyadh summit to 
establish a commercial arbitration center for the GCC states 
came at the same time as the Saudi Cabinet's resolution that 
Saudi Arabia would join the New York Agreement, to acknowledge 
and implement the rulings of foreign arbitrators. Needless to 
say, these two events are the beginning of a new era of 
international commercial arbitration at the GCC level. 
  Turning to the importance of the Gulf commercial arbitration 
center, this center will be a basic support for the protection 
of GCC citizens' rights. It will conclude the legal efforts they 
are enduring in foreign arbitration centers, because of the lack 
of recognized Arab or Gulf arbitration centers. On another 
front, the fact that Islamic law is the legal basis for settling 
commercial disputes, and the law that must be applied in 
disputes brought before the center, prevents the Muslim 
merchants of the Gulf from being subjected to foreign legal 
regulations that may contain outright contraventions of Islamic 
law, as used to happen. Naturally, the establishment of this 
center will encourage foreign firms to invest in the Gulf and 
boost the volume of their commercial dealings in the Gulf 
markets; they will have confidence in its legal foundation, and 
commercial arbitration will be an acknowledged principle in the 
settlement of any disputes between them an a Gulf entity. It is 
enough that it will be possible to stipulate in contracts 
ratified by two sides that disputes between the two sides will 
be settled by arbitration, in accordance with the measures and 
regulations of the Gulf commercial arbitration center. 
<H5>  Investment Obstacles </H5>
  [Rashwan] What are the chief obstacles to investment you 
think still exist in the Arab region? Do you think the Gulf 
region is a place that can absorb funds invested from abroad? 
  [Al-Dabbagh] Actually, the question of investment obstacles 
in the Arab countries has become a basic subject at any 
conference or Arab economic meeting. If we look at the laws that 
promote investing in the Arab countries, we may say that these 
laws have not had a practical and palpable effect at the 
pan-Arab level. This is due to many basic factors, chiefly the 
fact that these laws are just one factor out of many that make 
up the general investment climate in a given country. There are 
other economic, political, and social factors that play an 
important role in attracting and guiding foreign investment. 
There is evidence that the investment atmosphere in the Arab 
world, particularly in the private sector, is still full of 
obstacles. This has been confirmed by the results of a new 
questionnaire produced by the Arab Investment Guarantee 
Organization on the investment climate in the Arab world. It was 
circulated among a select group of Arab investors in diverse 
Arab countries. The results of the questionnaire indicated that 
the greatest obstacle was bureaucracy, the difficulty of 
registration and licensing measures, limited local markets, the 
lack of clarity and stability of the investment laws in some 
countries, and instability and slumps in the value of the local 
currency of some other countries, in addition to the lack of 
trained manpower. Turning to the investment climate in the Gulf 
states, we may say that, in light of current circumstances, the 
GCC states are seen as being among the most attractive areas for 
investment, thanks to the political stability they enjoy; their 
financial resources, which are sufficient to fund their 
industrial activities, or to participate in them with foreign 
investors; adherence to the principle of free economic activity; 
and encouragement of private initiatives. I may add that the GCC 
states have advanced infrastructures and a significant strategic 
location, and they enjoy a high per capita income and a strong 
consumer inclination.

<F P=106> [Article by Sa'id al-Qaysi: "Secret Network Rules North </F>
Yemen Using Saddam's Methods!"] 
  [Text] Yemen is on the threshold of war. The statement this 
time was made by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's vice-president 
in the General People's Congress [GPC], and it is considered to 
be true by all the people in power, by observers, and by Yemenis 
who are awaiting the catastrophe that is bound to happen--after 
everybody has crossed the redline and reached the point of no 
return; after the latest crisis has revealed behind-the-scenes 
activities in the regime, the contradictions of the rulers, and 
the absence of a unified authority. In this report from Sanaa, 
AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI reveals a [hitherto] unknown part of the 
background of the conflict going on in Yemen, the part that has 
played an important role in escalating this conflict and 
bringing the situation to a head. It has to do with the makeup 
of authority in Sanaa and the secret network built up by 
President Salih--or rather, which he participated in building 
up--in order to govern Yemen according to Saddam Husayn's 
methods. This is being accomplished by means of a "secret 
alliance" between the family and tribe that many people say 
rules Yemen, that is, the al-Ahmar family, and the extremist 
fundamentalist groups that have entered the arena and converted 
President Salih into their hostage, whom they threaten to expel 
any moment. It is known that southern Yemen is ruled by the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], but who really rules northern 
Yemen, and what is the role that the fundamentalist groups and 
Arab Afghans play there? 
  "Yemen is a country that is out of breath." Most of the 
people in government and observers agree with this remark. And 
there are those who are awaiting a catastrophe. This may happen 
because there no longer is anything to stop it, and everybody 
has crossed the redline. There is no authority. In the North, 
authority is in "unknown hands," as some of the educated people 
have said. 
  Talking about authority in Yemen is something that opens 
doors to a strange world that the crisis began to reveal and 
that has given it its dimensions. Everybody has come to know 
what is going on and who the bosses are--the family, the tribe, 
and the extremist fundamentalist groups. As for the corruption, 
this is a complete world unto itself, and stories concerning it 
have become regular fare at places of relaxation and 
khat-chewing rooms. "Nothing is new," according to a professor 
of sociology who has been in jail and does not care to go back 
there. 
  First there is the question of who is in charge. Who rules 
northern Yemen? The professor of sociology says: "We have a new 
royal family in the guise of a republican cover. We have the 
Bayt al-Ahmar monarchy in Yemen. Bayt al-Ahmar is one of the 
villages belonging to the Sanhan tribe located not far from the 
capital city of Sanaa. The al-Ahmar clan is considered to be one 
of the clans of the Hashid tribe which is headed by Shaykh 
'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, head of the Yemeni Chamber of 
Deputies and head of the Higher Committee of the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping [YRG] (the political facade of the Muslim Brotherhood). 
  In northern Yemen, all power is in the hands of the al-Ahmar 
family. The village of Bayt al-Ahmar was not known until it was 
at the center of events when one of its native sons, Lt. Col. 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih al-Ahmar, took over the reins of power in 
1978 after two presidents of the republic were killed in 
mysterious circumstances; they were President Ibrahim al-Hamdi 
and President Ahmad Husayn al-Ghashmi. From that time until 
today, the al-Ahmar clan has endeavored to consolidate its power 
and influence in the government, following the pattern of Saddam 
Husayn in Iraq. 
  The important positions in the military establishment and 
the 
security apparatus are occupied by the president's brothers, 
cousins, in-laws, and uncles--in other words, by blood 
relatives--and they are followed [in the hierarchy] by the other 
members of the clan. This is true in spite of the existence of 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], which has become merely a 
showcase. The head of the party and president of the republic 
does not trust anyone except individuals in his family and clan. 
For this reason, he has placed them in the most important 
military and security-related positions. 
  An examination of the rosters of the various commands of the 
armed forces in northern Yemen shows that most of the commanders 
of the brigades and units and all the management of the 
(technical, operational, and financial) offices in the armed 
forces and security apparatus are persons who are from the same 
tribal grouping, that is, Sanhan. 
  If anyone from any other tribal grouping occupies any of 
these positions, then he is at least from Hashid, the overall 
mother tribe. 
<H5>  Rule by Bayt al-Ahmar </H5>
  One notices that Bayt al-Ahmar, the birthplace of the 
president, accounts for the lion's share of the top positions, 
in fact, about 48 percent of them. Bayt al-Ahmar is then 
followed by the villages of Sayyan, Wadi Silmok, al-Jarda', and 
al-Dhanin. We find that Bayt al-Ahmar and four of its 
neighboring villages account for most of the top positions, that 
is, 22 of them, and this constitutes about 70 percent of the 
total. Consequently, we can say that many of the other villages 
inhabited by people belonging to the Sanhan clan do not enjoy 
the confidence of the president. In addition to this, no 
effective military command position is occupied by anyone from 
the Bakil tribe, which is Yemen's largest tribe that follows the 
Zaydi school of Islam, as do the Hashid tribes. Also, the areas 
of Ma'rib, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, al-Bayda', and Ibb, whose people 
follow the Shafi'i school of Islam, have no presence in the 
power structure. 
  The following is a list of persons who occupy the top 
positions: 
  Col. Muhammad 'Abdallah Salih al-Ahmar--the president's 
brother, commander of the central security units, which are 
deployed throughout Yemen's cities. 
  Col. 'Ali Salih 'Abdallah al-Ahmar--the president's 
half-brother by his mother, commander of the Republican Guard 
which is composed of 30,000 highly-trained soldiers armed with 
various modern advanced weapons. 
  Col. Muhammad Salih 'Abdallah al-Ahmar--the president's 
half-brother by his mother, commander of the Air Force and Air 
Defense Forces. 
  Col. 'Ali Salih Ahmad Muhsin al-Ahmar--the president's 
half-brother by his mother, commander of the artillery units in 
the Governorate of Sanaa. 
  Col. Muhammad Ahmad Isma'il al-Ahmar--the president's 
brother-in-law, commander of the 8th Brigade and commander of 
the troops stationed in the east. 
  Col. Muhammad 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar--relative of the 
president, deputy commander of the air defense affairs [branch] 
of the Air Force. 
  Col. 'Ali Muhsin Salih al-Ahmar--relative of the president, 
commander of the 1st Armored Division (Sanaa). 
  Col. 'Abd-al-Malik Ahmad al-Sayyani--from the village of 
Sayyan (Sanhan), chief of the general staff. 
  Col. 'Ali Ahmad al-Sayyani--from the village of Sayyan 
(Sanhan), chief of military intelligence. 
  Col. 'Ali 'Ali al-Sayyani--from the village of Sayyan 
(Sanhan), commander of the 1st Missile Brigade. 
  The list is long, and clearly indicates what the power 
structure is. 
  However, what about the regime's activity as related to 
terrorism, a matter which many people, both inside and outside 
Yemen, are talking about? 
  "Fundamentalist terrorism," in particular, intensified 
rapidly around the end of 1991, that is, after unification, and 
it has targeted the YSP and the opposition parties. However, 
since the end of 1992, investigations have begun to reveal the 
links of the terrorist fundamentalist groups, particularly after 
the attempt to assassinate 'Ali Salih 'Abbad, nicknamed "the 
Next One" [al-muqbil], who is a member of the Political Bureau 
of the YSP, and the explosions which targeted the Aden Hotel. 
The investigation revealed that the organization responsible was 
the Islamic Jihad movement, which is considered to be the 
military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, led by Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, the strong man in the Reform Party, 
who is also a member of the Presidential Council, the highest 
body of authority in Yemen. 
<H5>  Weapons from Somalia and Sudan </H5>
  According to official information, the Reform Party 
constitutes the political facade of the Muslim Brotherhood 
movement, which has been historically linked to Egypt since the 
sixties. However, starting in 1988, the movement began to 
change. It was restructured, by means of the creation of a 
military wing, during the war in Afghanistan. A total of 100 
soldiers were sent to Afghanistan to participate in the war and 
to train, and Sanaa has become the gathering point for a number 
of young Arabs who fought with the freedom- fighters in 
Afghanistan. In Sanaa they were supplied with official papers 
and travel tickets, and the main financier of these operations 
was one of the tribal leaders. 
  After [the war in] Afghanistan, the power struggles began. 
Several groups emerged, one of which was led by Yasin 
'Abd-al-'Aziz, a Shafi'i from Ma'rib who is not a bloody type 
and is not allied with the power structure. There is also a 
group known as the "Party of Iran," since most of its members 
regularly travel to Tehran. 
  In Sanaa, the "Arab Afghans" enjoy great freedom, live in 
"villas" in wealthy residential neighborhoods such as Hiddah 
[name as transliterated], which is where 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Zandani's residence is, and they have offices on Hiddah's 
main street. Usually the "Arab Afghans" engage in political 
activity in Sanaa and go there to rest before returning to their 
training camps located near the city of Sa'dah, in the far 
north, in the Ma'rib area, and in the Maraqishah mountains on 
the [former] border between the North and the South, near the 
southern Governorate of Shabwah. These camps are financed by the 
Reform Party and a wealthy Yemeni living in Khartoum whose name 
is Usamah Bin-Ladin and who is a friend of Shaykh al-Zandani. 
  Reports indicate that the terrorist groups have strong ties 
to the military commanders, especially the brigade and unit 
commanders, since the groups are transported in military 
vehicles. Some of the military commanders are directly 
responsible for some of the actions of terrorism. There is, for 
example, the officer Salih Dahmash, who is in charge of a cell 
in the southern Governorate of Abyan. He works under the command 
of Col. Muhsin al-Ahmar, commander of the armored division, who 
is the regime's strong man. Their weapons are transported in 
boats from Somalia and Sudan. Some of them go to the coastline 
of southern Yemen, and the rest are transported to the eastern 
coastline of Egypt on the Red Sea. 
  Official sources indicate that the fundamentalist groups 
have 
become so strong that they are threatening the regime of 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih. One person close to the president says that the 
problem is a very grave one, since these groups have capitalized 
on the crisis and have contributed toward inflaming the 
situation for the purpose of undertaking a palace coup and 
replacing the president with somebody else in his family who is 
from the Hashid tribe. 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice-president and 
secretary general of the YSP, says only that more than one 
Lockerbie-type of terrorist operation is being hatched in Yemen.

  [Text] After the various Yemeni political factions signed 
the Pledge and Accord Document, which was arrived at as a means 
of finding a way out of the burning political crisis in Yemen, 
has the crisis now come to an end with the signing of this 
document? 
  Has trust been established once again among the factions, 
and 
have both the incidental and basic disputes been settled? What 
is the future of Yemen's situation in view of this document, and 
how is it possible to put it into practice? 
  'UKAZ brought up these questions with some experts, and here 
are their opinions. 
<H5>  Dr. 'Abdallah al-Qabba', professor of political science at </H5>
King Sa'ud University: 
<H5>  Gaps in Document Threaten to Paralyze It </H5>
  If we take a careful look at the population map, economic 
situation, and political legacy of both parts of Yemen, we will 
find that the atmosphere that led to the unification of the two 
countries was, and still is, characterized by a type of 
suspicion and mistrust. We would also find that the tribal 
mentality, difference in political experience, and disagreement 
in views are some of the factors that have prevented the 
achievement of an ideal pattern of unity anticipated by the 
Yemenis. 
  Due to lack of clarity, the fact that political leaders 
resorted to delusions and wishful thinking, and refusal to 
recognize reality, the Yemeni experiment was pregnant with a 
host of contradictions and surprises, leaving the field wide 
open for individual interpretations and an approach that is 
unregulated, undisciplined, and does not involve political 
practices that possess modern administrative and constitutional 
frameworks. 
  Yemen's experience has been that of using assassination as a 
means of expressing protest and lack of satisfaction during past 
regimes, and the current ruling elite still deals with its 
opponents and enemies in this fashion and with this mentality. 
We often find expressions of this in the ethics of political 
acts in Yemen as well as in the terms used by thinkers and 
political parties. 
  Although Yemen's modern political history has already 
witnessed many reconciliation agreements--in particular, those 
which took place in Cairo, Tripoli, Kuwait, and Sudan--many 
people interested in Yemeni affairs are still hoping for success 
in the case of the Pledge and Accord Document which everyone 
prays will solve the problems that still exist between the two 
leadership groups that are fighting for power in Yemen. 
  Without entering into the details of the document, we hope 
that Yemen's leaders will rise to the occasion of the events and 
give priority to the factors of stability, and particularly that 
wisdom triumph over personal interests and aspirations and that 
disputes over trivialities not lead to a destructive civil war. 
  The Pledge and Accord Document is full of gaps and holes. 
There is also fear that there will once again be a dispute 
concerning interpretation of clauses dealing with local rule, 
merging the armed forces, and the right of disposal of public 
wealth and resources, and that this will lead to total paralysis 
of this agreement and consequently a return to the sanctioning 
of division and fragmentation of the country, as a prelude to a 
situation that could be even more deadly for Yemen and its 
people. 
<H5>  Hassan al-Mudallal, Yemeni writer: </H5>
<H5>  The Time-Bomb Agreement </H5>
  The agreement that bears a promising and ambitious name is 
called the "Pledge and Accord Document," and was made by the 
parties who took part in the Political Forces Dialogue for 
Building a Modern Yemeni State. It was an emergency rescue 
action that can, at best, be effective during its first phase. 
Although the agreement has created an atmosphere of optimism, it 
is necessary to call attention to the time bombs contained 
within it. These time bombs could cause matters to revert to 
their previous state or even worse, particularly since some 
people have already begun to speak of "victories." 
  It is clear that the agreement, in large part, constitutes a 
response to the document of eighteen points drawn up by the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] during the beginning of the crisis. 
This is something that has made it possible for some people to 
talk about "victories," and something that has postponed, by a 
few months, the matter of taking up issues that require the 
establishment of an immediate mechanism for implementation, such 
as the merging of the armed forces, the anchoring in place of 
administrative decentralization, and the fear that a dispute 
will erupt once again concerning this point--which, it appears, 
was one of the basic reasons for the outbreak of the crisis. 
  Verbal duels took place between the leaders of the General 
People's Congress [GPC] and the YSP just a few days after the 
agreement was arrived at. This has not allowed Yemenis to feel 
reassured and has impelled 'Abdallah al-Jifri, a member of the 
National Dialogue Committee and the leader of the People's 
Congress Party, to say that he does not believe that the parties 
of the coalition will implement the Pledge and Accord Document 
because it lacks a sound mechanism for implementation. He adds 
that these parties do not trust each other, and that this makes 
it difficult for them to implement the agreement. Some observers 
point out that what is happening is a postponement of the big 
explosion. Others believe that the Yemenis have chosen an 
appropriate moment to make a detour in order to avoid falling 
into the abyss of a civil war. Only a few believe that the 
agreement constitutes a firm basis for putting an end to the 
political crisis that is occurring in Yemen, particularly since 
the two parties in the crisis, during the last few months, have 
undertaken redoubled efforts to create ruptures in the fabric of 
Yemen. 
  At this juncture, two things have to be pointed out. First 
of 
all, a large segment of the Yemenis consider that the agreement 
recently arrived at is more important than the act of 
unification itself. Secondly, stability is what is demanded 
regionally and internationally, in addition to the fact that 
stability is demanded by the Yemeni people who are very anxious 
to preserve the unity and stability of their country from 
destruction by contentious parties. 
<H5>  Dr. Hasan Abu-Talib, head of the International Affairs Unit </H5>
at AL-AHRAM's Strategic Studies Center: 
<H5>  The Search for Mechanisms for Implementation </H5>
  There are several contradictory trends taking place at the 
same time in Yemen. Since the Document of Pledge [and Accord] 
was arrived at on 18 January of this year, after a dialogue that 
lasted four continuous months between all the political forces, 
reaching [actual] agreement still is a matter that faces a 
number of obstacles. They began with the problem of officially 
signing the document--which was accomplished yesterday. However, 
there is another problem, which is that of the appropriate 
mechanism for the implementation of the clauses written in the 
document, particularly since the political forces that 
participated in its formulation have felt that it represents a 
way out of the economic and political crisis that has been 
devastating the country for about the last two years. 
  After reading the document, my first remark is that it is an 
extremely comprehensive document. It will require tremendous 
political effort, whether from the leglislative or the 
procedural point of view, or even from the standpoint of making 
a series of great decisions that will affect the general social, 
political, and economic realms of the nation. 
  It is our belief that the fact that the agreement arrived at 
represents a positive development. However, this positive aspect 
faces a series of obstacles, as we have indicated. On the 
negative side, there is a series of collapses that have been 
taking place in various realms, both economic and 
security-related. This is also happening in the sense that 
Yemen's citizens have a profound feeling that there is a 
deeply-rooted crisis and that there are a large number of 
disputes between the political forces, both those participating 
in the coalition and those not participating in this coalition. 
<H5>  Dr. Siraj Zamzami, professor of political science at King </H5>
'Abd-al-'Aziz University: 
<H5>  How Can We Deal With the Mountain of Contradictions? </H5>
  It is difficult for anyone following the "thermometer" of 
the 
political temperature in Yemen to provide even an approximate 
picture of the future prospects for Yemen after the signing of 
the Pledge and Accord Document, and there are numerous reasons 
why this is so. One reason is that there are areas of dispute 
that go beyond what was mentioned in the text of the document. 
This document, as such, could be considered to be an indicator 
of the intensity of the sources of disharmony in the political 
thought of the parties concerned, in spite of the sincerity of 
feelings and the desire to proceed toward anchoring the 
foundations of unity and non-fragmentation and not to fall back 
into the traps of engaging in verbal hostility or taking up arms 
against each other. If we take a cursory glance at the text of 
the document, we find that there are 33 articles and about 180 
paragraphs and semi-paragraphs. Some of the paragraphs, if they 
are to be implemented, would require the services of an 
integrated government apparatus. This alone is sufficient to 
cause analysts to have the desire to decisively say that the 
document will be tantamount to a temporary or competing 
constitution. On the other hand, bringing up all the fears and 
solutions and coming to agreement concerning them confirms what 
was said by Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, member of the General 
Committee of the GPC and head of the Political Bureau's 
delegation in the National Dialogue Committee: "We are prepared 
to accept anything in order to ensure the survival of our united 
Yemeni nation." Perhaps the document's conclusion prophesies in 
advance the role that must be played by all of the main forces 
in the coalition or those who are outside the power structure: 
"Implementation of this document, in accordance with what is 
mentioned in it, would constitute a strong basis for reforming 
our country's political and economic situation and would pull it 
out of all of its crises. This will require a strong political 
will which is united both in terms of word and deed in our 
actions and activity, as well as keeping promises, being 
sincere, and being committed....as long as our goal is that of 
maintaining unity." 
  There is no doubt that marathon-like exhaustive efforts were 
expended in order to formulate the Pledge and Accord Document in 
such a way that it would please all of the parties participating 
in the government. The parties signed it because they were not 
prepared to take historical responsibility for causing the 
agreement to fail. This is in spite of the fact that there are 
many strong indicators that the situation in Yemen is becoming 
increasingly complicated and causes one to have serious doubts 
as to whether it is possible to implement the agreement because 
of the huge mountains of debris that have been dumped onto the 
crossroads of its paths in an attempt to obstruct it after it 
was signed. This is because the military and security-related 
problem, which the agreement began to deal with, could be solved 
if the soldiers returned to their barracks and if responsibility 
for taking care of internal security issues were once again put 
into the hands of the authorities [normally] concerned with 
them. But the fact is, apparently, that the crisis exists 
because of the lack of bases for the existence of elements of 
trust between the two pivots of the triangular pyramid. Mr. 
Muhammad Basindwah, the minister of foreign affairs, has already 
said: "Yemen is experiencing an undeclared break-up." Perhaps it 
is experiencing a break-up inside its united leadership, not to 
mention the traditional trend of the provinces to serve as 
alternatives to the system of hereditary local power structures. 
Perhaps the recently-held al-Mukalla conference provides an 
indicator of these inclinations. But objectivity also obliges an 
analyst to attempt to seize upon some of the merits of the 
document and see in them, in case they are put into practice, a 
better political future that will guarantee Yemen the stability 
to turn the wheels of the slumping Yemeni economy and bring 
trust back to the masses....who know that a united caravan is 
better than one that is split up, especially if it goes in the 
same wrong direction.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abdallah Hammudah: "Yemen: The Blood of Abyan </F>
Is Splattering All Over the Pledge and Accord Document"] 
  [Text] The latest events in the Governorate of Abyan, in 
southern Yemen, have stirred up numerous inquiries concerning 
unification of the two Yemens. The questions asked by observers 
from abroad concern whether or not Yemen would continue to be 
united or, in case it ends up being split up, what would be the 
type of relationship between the two Yemens that used to be 
separate and perhaps will be so in the future as well? 
  The Yemenis themselves are still avoiding asking this 
question and are restricting their discussions to what could be 
the final form of the nation they are attempting to build. 
  In Zinjibar, the capital of the governorate, and in Mudiyah 
and Lawdar, armed clashes took place between northern and 
southern forces. There were many reasons for these armed 
clashes, according to the points of view of the various Yemeni 
political parties and the two main parties, the General People's 
Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], in 
particular. 
  These clashes are considered to be the most dangerous 
developments to Yemeni unity that have occurred so far since 
unification was officially declared on 22 May 1990. Also, they 
constitute the third armed confrontation that has taken place 
between northern and southern forces during the last 22 years. 
<H5>  Reasons for the Danger </H5>
  However, there are four main factors that make the latest 
confrontation different from the previous two clashes that 
occurred in 1972 and 1979: 
  1. It is the first confrontation of this type that has 
happened within the framework of the unified nation, although 
the mobilized forces participating on each side are evidence of 
the degree of fragility of the institutions that represent the 
structure of the state and the likelihood that this state has no 
future if matters continue to be as they are right now. 
  2. The confrontation is occurring during the time when a 
newly-appointed governor is assuming his duties of office. This 
governor is Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad, one of the top men of 'Ali 
Nasir Muhammad, the former president of South Yemen. The 
fighting is happening in the midst of a dispute concerning the 
legality of appointing him by means of a decision made by the 
prime minister, as a prelude to having the Presidential Council 
later on issue a decree appointing him to this position. Some 
people--especially those in the YSP--say that the fighting began 
in order to prevent him from arriving in the governorate to 
assume the duties of his office. 
  3. The fighting has happened in a governorate that--since 
the 
events of 13 January 1986 that put an end to the rule of 'Ali 
Nasir--has maintained its stance of (silent) opposition to rule 
by the YSP in its present form in South Yemen, and the situation 
remained the same even after unification because the YSP 
continues to have its influence in the South. From the strategic 
point of view of the northern forces, it was considered to be an 
important event in the series of efforts aimed at crushing the 
attempt to revive the southern regime in Aden, because 
dominating the governorate of Abyan would furnish the missing 
link in the series of military positions necessary to encircle 
the "unified nation's economic and business capital" from the 
east. This would make it easy to isolate the Governorates of 
Aden and Lahij in the west from the Governorates of Shabwah, 
Hadramawt, and al-Mahrah in the east, where the sources of 
petroleum wealth are. 
  A related issue here is the fact that this confrontation, 
from the point of view of the North, had the objective of: 
preventing a reconciliation between the wing of the YSP that is 
currently part of the power structure in the unified state and 
the wing that split off with 'Ali Nasir during the events of 
January 1986, the popular base of which is considered to be 
Abyan; and picturing the battle as being fought between the 
natives of Abyan, who supported the northern forces (the 
al-'Amaliqah [Giants] Brigade) against the southern YSP forces, 
which include the YSP militia formations known as the Madram 
Brigade, and the 5th Armored Brigade, which came from Aden to 
support it. 
  One thing that helped to highlight the idea of this "old 
feeling of revenge" and the attempt to use this opportunity to 
exploit it is the fact that the al-Wahdah [Unity] Brigade, which 
participated in the fighting after being transferred from 
Hadramawt to Abyan, was the unit that, after the events during 
January [of 1986], restored the situation in the governorate so 
that it would favor the wing of the YSP that is currently in 
power. Both local and northern elements accuse it of having 
committed horrible atrocities as it undertook its task. 
  4. The fourth factor is the participation of some of the 
"Arab Afghans" who are headquartered in the al-Maraqishah 
mountains. Reports say that an estimated three brigades of 
soldiers from the Yemeni Reform Grouping (YRG) militias also 
participated in the skirmishes--in civilian clothes--together 
with the southern forces in an attempt to portray the 
confrontation as being one between civilians who are natives of 
the governorate and "remnants of the former communist regime in 
the south who refuse to be incorporated into the unified state 
and are trying to regain their dominance, even if this would be 
at the expense of the future of the unified state." 
  Some observers are suggesting that it is dangerous to rely 
on 
extremist militias, which are not known for being disciplined, 
to decide a political struggle being waged within the framework 
of the state. They point out Egypt's experience in this regard, 
when president Anwar Sadat encouraged a trend such as this one 
in order to contain Nasirite and Marxist elements. Not only did 
this effort end with him being assassinated by them. The result 
was also an aggravation of the problem posed by the extremist 
Islamic groups at the present time. 
<H5>  A Rocky Road </H5>
  Whatever the losses were as a result of the events in 
Abyan--some local reports insist that as many as dozens or 
hundreds of people were killed and wounded, whereas politicians 
from the various Yemeni political factions maintain that no more 
than six persons were killed and a few dozen were injured, 
because the "skirmishes were within the framework of Yemeni 
traditions which follow the practice of firing into the 
air"--the fact remains that they constitute a step on the rocky 
road toward unity. There are apprehensions that they may lead to 
a relapse or end up being a case of "fleeing toward the front," 
which would postpone any real effort to deal with the problem, 
like what happened in the years 1972 and 1979. 
  The problem is that the latest skirmishes occurred last 20 
February. This is the same date that many people thought would 
be the day of a "serious attempt" to solve the Yemeni crisis, 
that is, the day of the signing of the Pledge and Accord 
Document in the Jordanian capital of Amman after it had been 
signed by the members of the Political Forces Dialogue Committee 
who had arrived at an agreed upon formula after more than two 
months of consultations and after they had initialed it last 18 
January. 
  Yemeni political forces consider the document to be the 
culmination of the unity agreements, and that it is no less 
important than they are. But the road toward Yemeni unity is 
littered with agreements that were not implemented. The parties 
who signed them have merely used them as a way out of some 
particular crisis. This happened in the cases that preceded the 
unification of the two parts of the country. But it seems that a 
contradiction of interests under the system of a unified country 
is the cause of the state of alert and mobilization for war at 
the present time which, if not settled in rational fashion, will 
blow up the new-born nation. 
<H5>  First Conflict </H5>
  The first armed conflict between the PDRP [Peoples 
Democratic 
Republic of Yemen] and the YAR [Yemen Arab Republic] began, in 
the summer of 1972, with the parties involved resorting to a 
reconciliation--under the slogan of unity--which was embodied in 
the Cairo Agreement of 28 October and then the Tripoli 
Declaration of 28 November of the same year. But a year later 
tension returned between Sanaa and Aden, and work toward 
unification came to a halt because there was internal conflicts 
within both Yemens also, until Lt. Col. Ibrahim al-Hamdi took 
over the presidency of North Yemen on 13 June 1974 and began the 
dialogue once again between the two parties. 
  But this new attempt at unification ended with the murder of 
al-Hamdi on 11 October 1977, the day before he was to leave to 
sign the unity agreement in Aden, and relations continued to be 
tense. The media battle escalated during the administration of 
Lt. Col. Ahmad Husayn al-Ghashmi, who became president after 
al-Hamdi. Al-Ghashmi, in turn, was assassinated in the famous 
briefcase explosion incident which occurred in June of 1978--a 
suicide mission carried out by a South Yemeni by the name of 
al-Hajj Tafarish. This led to deep cracks in the ranks of the 
YSP, and ended with the overthrow of President Salim Rabi' 
Salimayn and his execution. 
  The situation only calmed down with the holding of the 
summit 
meeting in Kuwait between 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il, the secretary 
general of the YSP in South Yemen, and Col. 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, president of North Yemen, during the period 28-30 March 
1979, after armed clashes had begun between the two parties on 
24 February of that same year. 
  The summit meeting ended with an agreement to resume the 
dialogue concerning unification, and a committee was formed to 
finish setting up the unified nation's constitution and then to 
prepare to form a ministerial committee to conduct a plebscite 
concerning unity. All of this was to take place within a maximum 
period of six months. 
<H5>  The Problem of Political Niches </H5>
  From the above it is clear that unification, which was the 
basis of the legitimacy of both regimes before it was 
implemented, has now become the source of legitimacy for all of 
the Yemeni political parties after implementation. The issue has 
been transformed from a dispute or an agreement between two 
different systems, both of which have adopted totalitarianism on 
a different basis (Marxist and internationalist in South Yemen, 
and Arabist and nationalist in North Yemen), into the inability 
to provide mature political niches in the unified nation, which 
has decided to adopted a multiparty system. 
  Hardly had unity been achieved on 22 May 1990 when one of 
the 
first things the Presidential Council decided to do was to grant 
the freedom to form political parties and organizations. Right 
away about 45 political parties and organizations sprang up. 
Some of these were under the umbrella of the ruling party in the 
North (the GPC), such as the YRG and the Ba'th Party. Others 
were opposition groups abroad or in either the North or the 
South, such as the Sons of Yemen Association (RA'Y), the Yemeni 
Unionist Grouping Party, the group of Nasirite parties, and the 
Truth [al-Haqq] Party. Other parties small in size and of little 
importance also arose, and they were dubbed the "fledgeling 
parties." 
  These "fledgeling" parties were mostly wings of the two main 
ruling parties (the GPC and the YSP), and were relied on for 
financing and organizational support and to carry out certain 
tasks in the political arena of maneuver during the hazy phase 
that predominated during the transitional period. At the present 
time this game has been revealed, and all of the parties have 
discovered what their real weight results from the elections of 
last April. However, some of the parties with a history behind 
them were not sufficiently fortunate, either because of 
fragmentation of votes or because of procedural problems in the 
electoral process. Accusations of vote fraud were made after the 
elections against the three parties and their independent allies 
that won more than three-fourths of the seats in the Chamber of 
Deputies (301 seats). 
  The problem of the political niches existed because it was 
difficult to find a means of grouping the Yemeni parties 
together after the elections, and the political maneuvering led 
to a type of division among them. The "National Congress of 
Political Parties and Organizations" ended up opposing the 
"Congress of Political Parties and Organizations, Grass Roots 
Organizations, and Professional and Creative Unions." But some 
of the parties objected to the domination in the National 
Congress by the two parties in power during the transitional 
period (the GPC and the YSP), and demanded that the unions also 
be represented, in spite of the dispute concerning their 
political capacity. Some made an appeal to have the their 
activities restricted to their professional realm and to looking 
after the affairs of their members. 
  During this period also the GPC and the YSP were subjected 
to 
lots of criticism because they shared power among themselves 
after unification, even on the level of minor positions such as 
office manager, and because many people were deprived of the 
opportunity to participate in managing the affairs of their 
country during this important phase of its history. This 
happened because the consideration of loyalty to one of the two 
parties was, in the eyes of the leadership of these two parties, 
more important than capability and experience. They hoped that 
the situation would improve after the elections. 
<H5>  Absence of Democracy </H5>
  There was much criticism in the Yemeni political arena 
concerning how democracy was being put into practice. Many 
people said that it was merely the heavyweights balancing and 
squaring off against each other, with the basic principle being 
that of dividing power between two parties--the GPC and the 
YSP--during the transitional period preceding the parliamentary 
elections. The same criticism was made, particularly by the 
opposition parties, after the YRG participated in the ruling 
coalition with the other two parties. The point was that all 
citizens did not get to participate in the making of decisions 
concerning their lives. However, the truth of the matter is that 
there is no totalitarian system in unified Yemen, and this has 
provided lots of opportunity for Yemeni citizens to freely 
express themselves. But it is still true that their absence of 
participation in the decisionmaking, the nation's state of 
paralysis, and a [general] inability to make decisions, have 
been an obvious manifestation of life in Yemen since the 
unification. 
  This paralysis has also allowed the centers of power 
associated with the main parties to fulfill their role of 
maintaining their influence and achieving gains by means of 
their influence, because there has been an absence of respect 
for the nation's regime and its influence, and they have 
utilized this absence to the detriment of the public interest. 
With the laxness in security, we have seen things such as the 
"'Aqlan al-Rashidi" phenomenon, the reference being to a 
prominent merchant, a member of the Hashid tribe, who has been 
accused by the YSP of engaging in counterfeiting money, 
smuggling, dealing in narcotics, murder, etc. 
  Accusations have also been made against the big shots in the 
various parties to the effect that they have exploited the 
apparatus of the government for their own interests, and it has 
been said that military commanders have moved their units 
without orders from the Ministry of Defense or the chief of 
staff. 
  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has denied any knowledge of 
his military police forces stopping the procession of Engineer 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister, during his return 
from Aden to Sanaa, although al-'Attas assures everyone that he 
had informed all the authorities concerned about his movement 
and the itinerary of his procession. 
  Some opposition parties are currently saying that the 
division of power and influence into two parts during the 
transitional period became a three-way division after the 
parliamentary elections of 27 April last year, when the YRG 
joined the ruling coalition. 
  But sources who support the YSP still feel that the division 
of power is a division into two parts because, although the YRG 
has emerged from under the umbrella of the GPC, there is still a 
clear division of roles between them with regard to the adoption 
of positions for the purpose of pursuing definite and particular 
goals in their confrontation with the YSP and the opposition 
groups allied with it. 
<H5>  Probabilities of a Confrontation </H5>
  Before he died, Muhammad 'Ali Haytham, South Yemen's first 
prime minister and the former minister of social security, told 
AL-MAJALLAH that military battles nearly broke out between the 
northern and southern forces shortly before the elections. He 
died eight months ago, and his secrets went to the grave with 
him. However, political observers have reported that 
undemocratic electoral practices were the cause, and people in 
the opposition accused the three victorious parties of having 
attempted to break previously-made agreements to divide 
electoral districts among themselves, then some of them [again] 
tried to violate those agreements, and the struggle almost 
reached the point of being an explosion. But all the coalition 
parties insistently deny this. 
  From the time of the confrontation, which did not end up 
taking place during the election period, until the time of the 
confrontation, which did occur on the day of the signing of the 
Pledge and Accord Document in Amman, Yemeni citizens have not 
felt any great degree of confidence that the unified nation of 
Yemen will survive. In fact, some of them have even begun to 
"open up" lines that were previously shut down, because they are 
afraid of what fate might have in store for them after the 
events in Abyan have shown that the pledge and accord constitute 
something found only in the pages of the document, because of 
which the struggle broke out even before the ink of the 
signatures on the document was dry. 
<H5>  Historical Sequence of the Yemeni Crisis </H5>
  September 1991: The killing of Engineer Hasan al-Haribi was 
considered to be the first of a series of assassination attempts 
made against the leaders of the YSP and other organizations 
associated with it. So far, this has resulted in the deaths of 
about 155 persons. 
  April-June 1992: First act of seclusion in Aden by 
Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the YSP. 
  9-11 December 1992: Wave of demonstrations in Yemen's major 
cities, protesting the economic crisis and corruption, results 
in more than 10 killed and about 30 wounded, and 300 persons are 
arrested on charges of rioting and looting. 
  February 1993: The catastrophe of floods in Aden, and then 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is received with protest 
demonstrations because of the "deliberate neglect" of the city 
after unification. 
  Spring of 1993: Al-Bid's second act of seclusion in Aden and 
Hadramawt, which ended after the agreement, and the date of the 
first multiparty elections in unified Yemen is 27 April 1993, 
after they had been postponed twice from October 1992 and 
February 1993. 
  August 1993: Al-Bid's third act of seclusion in Aden, in 
protest of the "lack of seriousness in implementing the 
unification agreements." 
  December 1993: Decline in the value of the Yemeni riyal from 
about 52 riyals to the dollar to more than 65 riyals to the 
dollar. The exchange rates had improved 15 percent after the 
Pledge and Accord Document was initialed on 18 January. But then 
these rates went down once again and fluctuated because of the 
continuation of the crisis, and this led to small, scattered 
demonstrations in Sanaa and Ta'izz. 
  December 1993: Mobilization of large military forces at the 
[former] borders of northern and southern Yemen, including the 
deployment of principal units to reinforce the front lines of 
the confrontation. 
  20 February 1994: Outbreak of skirmishes between the 
northern 
al-'Amaliqah Brigade and the southern Madram Brigade (party 
militias) in the two cities of Zinjibar and Mudiyah in the 
Governorate of Abyan on the day of the signing of the Pledge and 
Accord Document in Amman, then the skirmishes spread to the 
Lawdar area and Arab Afghan soldiers enter the fray. 
  Most Significant Obstacles Facing Yemeni National Unity 
  I. Structural Obstacles 
  1. Type of State: Points of view differ as to whether to 
adopt the system of a unified state of the type that 
predominates today or to have a federal system or a 
confederation. 
  The GPC and the YRG (the two northern partners in the 
current 
ruling coalition) adhere to the idea of a unified state, and 
feel that "the only alternative is a plan to split up." The YSP 
(the southern partner), however, rejects this, and feels that it 
amounts to a "process of subjugation, a curbing of the process 
of development in Yemen, and a refusal to create a model in the 
South which could be adopted by the North in a subsequent stage." 
  2. Presidency of the Nation: The GPC and the YRG adhere to a 
presidential system based on election of a president who then 
appoints his vice president and possesses extensive powers. 
  The YSP demands that there be a Presidential Council during 
the current stage, until the Constitution is modified and 
stipulates that both the president and vice president be elected 
either together or separately, with the vice president being 
allotted definite powers. 
  3. System of Executive Authority: The GPC and the YRG demand 
a system that is a combination of the presidential and 
parliamentary system, in which the president divides authority 
with the government. 
  The YSP, however, insists that the system be a parliamentary 
one, including a strong government that assumes the task of 
carrying out the executive powers and shares some of the 
president's sovereign powers, in a way that would be determined 
by the Constitution after it is modified. 
  4. Type of Legislative Authority: The GPC agreed to the 
establishment of another parliamentary council, called the 
Consultative Council, in which two-thirds of the members would 
be elected and one-third would be appointed and they would be 
persons possessing expertise and qualifications. This council 
would share legislative power with the Chamber of Deputies. The 
18 governorates would have equal representation in it. This 
proposal was made by the YSP. But the YRG rejected this, but 
then accepted it with reservations, setting the condition that 
the legislative spheres of authority of the Consultative Council 
be limited. Some people say that the YRG feels that this council 
would be competing with the Chamber of Deputies, the head of 
which is Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, head of the 
Higher Committee of the YRG. 
  II. Legislative Obstacles 
  1. Education Law: Although this law was established before 
the 27 April 1993 elections, the YRG still feels committed to 
change it because it rejects the merging of the educational 
institutes of the religious type into the system of public 
education and considers this to be an attack on the very basis 
of the system of religious education. 
  Informed sources told AL-MAJALLAH that the reason that the 
YRG has been so quiet about this point so far is the fact that 
it has received 1.3 billion riyals from the state, in accordance 
with a promise from the GPC and the YSP, to be used as a budget 
for financing the religious institutes--even though 
administration of these institutes is supposed to be the job of 
the public education apparatus--so that the YRG not feel that it 
has lost its influence entirely. The sources added that this was 
part of the deal for having the YRG enter the ruling coalition 
in Yemen. 
  2. Local Rule Law: The local rule law is still a matter of 
dispute. The YSP demands that the governors and the heads of the 
directorates and local councils be elected, whereas the YRG 
wants election only of the governors, at the present stage, and 
the local councils, but wishes to see the heads of the 
directorates and their subordinates appointed, with the 
provision that they be elected at a subsequent stage. 
  III. Procedural Obstacles 
  1. Unification of the Armed Forces: Although numerous plans 
have been submitted for merging the armed forces of the two 
previous Yemens, each party has rejected the plans of the other 
party, and the northern and southern units have remained 
separated from each other. 
  One failed plan was that of merging the units on a 
fifty-fifty basis, because the GPC (northern Yemen) says that 
southern Yemen's population is only between 2.5 and 3 million 
and this does not justify the size of the armed forces that the 
YSP has. It rejects the merge on this basis also because it 
would create an open field for the possibility of bringing the 
armed struggle inside the units. 
  The YSP demands the dismissal of military commanders who are 
relatives of persons who occupy the principal positions in the 
government (such as the president's brother), whereas the GPC 
responds with the demand to disband the units that mostly 
consist of troops from a particular directorate or governorate. 
  The process of unification of the armed forces is one that 
is 
being subjected to political bargaining because the YSP is 
keeping its armed forces as a card to play until its demands are 
met concerning modification of the type of state and achievement 
of separation between the presidency of the state, in its 
present form, and the military establishment, but the GPC sees 
this rejection as a type of implicit rebellion. 
  2. Security Problem: This is considered to be one of the 
most 
important issues that the YSP feels is an obstacle to stability 
and the process of building a modern state. The reason for this 
is that the fact that its leaders are being subjected to 
assassination attempts has, for them, transformed the issue from 
merely being one concerning the particular form according to 
which the state is to be constructed to being one of "life and 
death." This is why all of the YSP's main leaders have left 
Sanaa and gone back to Aden. 
  Another matter that complicates this issue is that the YSP 
accuses the leaders in the government who belong to the other 
two parties in the ruling coalition (the GPC and YRG) of 
protecting and sheltering persons who commit assassinations and 
operate outside the law, for the purpose of obstructing the 
pursuance of the YSP's demands and forcing the YSP to put itself 
within the framework of the system that existed in the north 
before unification took place. 
<H5>  Blow of Revenge </H5>
  Political observers interpret the blow that was dealt 
against 
the 5th Brigade--one of the military units subordinate to 'Ali 
Nasir Muhammad, the former president of South Yemen, which 
currently has been merged into the the northern Yemeni 
formations and is part of the 1st Armored Division, which is 
commanded by Col. 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, the president's 
half-brother--as an act of revenge because it was described as 
being a unit that brings together the YSP and dissidents who had 
previously split off from it. 
  During the middle of last February, the members of the 
brigade had refused to remove their comnmander, Colonel 
'Abdallah Shulayl, and accept the appointment, in his place, of 
Col. Taymas, based on a decision by the (northern) chief of 
staff. In this matter, they were supported by the (southern) 
minister of defense, Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir, who 
is curently in Aden. 
  The members of this brigade have a history of protesting 
what they have seen as lack of interest in them by both northern 
and southern commanders. They have said that they are treated as 
"third class" military personnel, and that supplies and food 
always come late to them. In addition to this, they see a lack 
of interest in providing them with light weapons; they say that 
the weapons they get are of poor quality, and they say that 
their training programs are neglected. 
<H5>  Old Forms! </H5>
  A leading official in the YSP has responded to the 
accusation 
of "separatism," which was based on the publication of the death 
certificate of the journalist Muhammad Sa'id Shamsan al-Sharafi, 
in the Sanaa newspaper AL-THAWRAH, from the Hospital of the 
Republic in Aden, which bore the number 66319 and was on a form 
bearing the name "People's Democratic Republic of Yemen." He 
said: "We have many old forms, and usually the official removes 
the old name and writes in longhand, in its place, `The Republic 
of Yemen.' In this case he may have forgotten to do this because 
of the circumstances of the death." 
  One of the GPC leaders had made this accusation, within the 
context of a larger implicit accusation, when referring to the 
journalist's death "in mysterious circumstances," when he went 
to Aden to spend his new year's holiday there. He pointed out 
that "this happened, even though al-Sharafi was a member of the 
YSP." 
  The YSP official pointed out that the use of old forms also 
occurs in Sanaa as well as in Aden. He said that the reason for 
this is the lack of availability of funds for printing new forms 
that would bear the name "The Republic of Yemen." He said that 
this was like the case involving the delay in the printing of 
the "unified riyals" and the delay in other procedures involving 
the building of the new state.

  [Text] India is in the agonising process of an evaluation 
whether the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, should 
call-off or postpone his proposed visit to the United States, 
sometime in summer. The Ministry of External Affairs itself is 
sharply divided on the issue with one section strongly 
advocating the visit, while the other group pleads that in the 
vitiated atmosphere nothing tangible will emerge, which would 
help consolidate the ties between the two countries and remove 
growing misunderstandings on a host of issues. 
  If one were to analyse the tone and tenor of recent remarks 
by the American President, Mr Bill Clinton, and his aides, it is 
evident that they do not see India requiring any high-level 
attention. Probably, this has been the trend for well over two 
decades. No American President visited India since Mr Jimmy 
Carter, nor for that matter has any Secretary of State come in 
the past decade. There do not seem to be any plans for any 
visits in the near future either. 
  The Americans have even managed without an Ambassador to 
India. Basically, there is a love-hate relationship between 
India and the United States. But all the loving and hating is 
done by India only. 
  Be that as it may, there are those who feel that the recent 
spate of provocative statements from the White House and the 
State Department makes it all the more imperative for Mr 
Narasimha Rao to meet the top U.S. leadership and other opinion 
makers in the country. They point out that such 
misunderstandings can only be sorted out at the highest 
political level and the Prime Minister would be making a mistake 
if he did not do so because of false prestige. 
  If indeed, as is widely believed here, certain key aides of 
President Clinton were responsible for pushing this 
administration towards a hostile position vis-a-vis India, a 
personal encounter between him and Mr Rao may well restore the 
balance. Moreover, Prime Minister Rao would also have the 
opportunity in Washington to meet influential Congressmen, 
Senators, officials, academics and journalists to explain New 
Delhi's case on Kashmir, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty 
(NPT) and a host of other contentious issues. 
  Those who support Mr Narasimha Rao's going to Washington are 
convinced that he would get strong backing from the business 
lobby there which is keen to invest in this country because of 
the economic liberalisation. The Prime Minister himself is 
perceived as the chief sponsor of the reform policy and this 
should enable him [to] project a progressive image of India in 
the United States as a counter to anti-Indian propaganda about 
human rights violations in Kashmir and Punjab as well as on 
nuclear proliferation in the sub-continent. 
  Comparisons are being drawn with the political leadership in 
Beijing which has managed to deflect criticism on the human 
rights front by luring big American business with tempting 
investment prospects in China. A similar gambit by Narasimha 
Rao, it is argued, could yield handsome dividends with U.S. 
businessmen pressurising the Clinton Administration to stop 
making provocative statements and gestures against this country. 
  The other argument in favour of the proposed visit by Mr 
Narasimha Rao is that if he refused to go to Washington out of 
pique with the Clinton administration, it would only allow 
Pakistan--its Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, is also 
scheduled to visit the United States within a few months--a free 
propaganda run. It is felt that Ms Bhutto would then use this to 
project New Delhi as inflexible and recalcitrant on issues like 
Kashmir and NPT. 
  Those who are against the Prime Minister going to 
Washington, 
however, turn these arguments on their head. They point out that 
in diplomacy, timing is almost everything and at a time when 
there is so much suspicion and misunderstanding between 
Washington and New Delhi, a Prime Ministerial visit could be 
counterproductive with only the differences between two 
countries getting articulated. 
  Conventional wisdom would suggest that the overall impact on 
bilateral relations of the sustained barrage of negative 
pronouncements on India from the Clinton Administration, 
including the President himself, cannot be healed by a mere 
visit to Washington by Mr Narasimha Rao. In fact, there is a 
possibility of both sides being unduly sensitive about working 
out a compromise at the moment. 
  There is also the question of personal vibes between Mr 
Narasimha Rao and the U.S. President. Both leaders come from 
different generations and cultures with clashing styles and 
world views. 
  While it is possible that a leader like Rajiv Gandhi may 
have 
hit it off with President Clinton, this appears to be far more 
unlikely in the case of Prime Minister Rao. Even if there are no 
open hostilities, there is every chance that a personal 
encounter between the two would be lacklustre and per-functory, 
resulting in no diplomatic breakthrough. 
  Mr Narasimha Rao's mild professorial style, however 
impressive to the knowledgeable on India affairs, is also 
unlikely to attract much media attention in the United States. 
This may lead to unfavourable comparisons with Ms Bhutto's visit 
which is bound to cause more flutter in the U.S. media. 
  In any case, the flamboyant young Harvard educated leader 
has 
many more personal friends in the U.S. establishment, 
particularly in the Clinton Administration. Under the 
circumstances, Mr Narasimha Rao, if he goes to Washington, would 
be running a patently unequal race with his Pakistani 
counterpart. 
  Significantly, most officials both in the Foreign Office and 
the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) are palpably unenthusiastic 
about Mr Narasimha Rao visiting Washington at this point. While 
the Foreign Office is worried about the risk of an unsuccessful 
Prime Ministerial visit to the United States further 
complicating the already vexed triangular relationship between 
New Delhi, Washington and Islamabad, the PMO is apprehensive 
about the political repurcussions at home in the event of Mr 
Narasimha Rao failing to pull off a public relations coup with 
President Clinton. 
  There is a vast body of opinion-makers in this country 
today, 
including the national media, which closely follows the progress 
of Indo-U.S. ties under a microscope. Not surprisingly, the 
success or failure of Mr Rao's visit in all probability would be 
exaggerated beyond its real implications for the relationship 
between the two countries. 
  While in the long run, whether the Prime Minister goes ahead 
or not with his trip to the United States may have far less 
impact on bilateral ties than other factors. Mr Rao would have 
to carefully weigh the pros and cons before agreeing to fix 
dates for the proposed visit. 
  This has posed a serious dilemma for the Prime Minister who 
has been pressing for a visit to Washington for the past many 
months. A successful trip, besides restoring balance to 
Indo-U.S. ties, would add yet another diplomatic feather to Mr 
Rao's cap already embroidered with recent breakthroughs in 
Beijing and Tehran and Davos. 
  A failure or even a damp squib in Washington, on the other 
hand, would not only mean a personal loss of face for Prime 
Minister Rao but also further add to the mounting strident 
anti-U.S. chorus in this country.

  [Text] President Bill Clinton's recent remarks on human 
rights in Kashmir violate all diplomatic norms and India is 
perfectly justified in reacting angrily, a former American 
Ambassador to India, Mr William Clark, has said. 
  The Clinton Administration has indeed changed the neutral 
policies on Kashmir pursued by both Democratic and Republican 
Administrations for several years, he said at a briefing on the 
India chair and his upcoming Indian visit at the Foreign Press 
Centre of the United States Information Agency (USIA) in 
Washington. 
  Mr Clark is leaving for India on Sunday and hopes to be able 
to meet the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, the Finance 
Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, and leaders of industry to mobilize 
moral and material support for the Japan chair at the Centre for 
Strategic and International Studies where he holds the Japan 
chair and is a senior adviser on Asia. 
  Mr Clark who improved Indo-American relations, sees his work 
being undone by the Clinton Administration, conceded that U.S. 
"interest in India has over time in Washington not been 
proportionate to its size." 
  "It has been very hard to keep India on the scope and it is 
very hard to do that today. The majority of articles that appear 
in the American press deal with Kashmir, Punjab--though that has 
fallen out--or the less positive aspects of society," he said. 
  On Mr Clinton's mistakes over Kashmir, Mr Clark said that 
during his confirmation hearings, he had emphasised the Shimla 
agreement. "I still think that it is the right way to do it. I 
won't talk about this Administration's handling of it but it has 
a slightly different approach." 
  Mr Clark, the U.S. Envoy to New Delhi from 1989 to 1992, 
thought that part of the reason for the deterioration in 
Indo-U.S. relations was the long delay in nominating an 
Ambassador to India. 
  Analysing why the Clinton Administration's India policy 
appears to have taken a turn for the worse, Mr Clark said: "This 
President clearly wants to be a domestic President, who tries to 
limit his foreign policy time as much as he can. He is driven by 
Bosnia and Somalia and other things. It is not surprising that 
India does not necessarily get up that high in (Mr Clinton's) 
thought." 
  Referring to the new Pakistani Envoy to the United States, 
Ms Maleeha Lodhi's speech raking up Kashmir while presenting her 
credentials, he said it was ""unprofessional," although he 
added, "but then Lodhi is not a professional and so I cannot 
blame her." 
  President Clinton had backed Ms Lodhi, saying, "We share 
Pakistan's concerns about human rights abuses in Kashmir." 
  Mr Clark has no clue as to what might have prompted Mr 
Clinton's remark. "I cannot explain that one. You should ask the 
White House," he replied to a query.

<F P=106> [Article by Manoj Joshi: "India's Defensive Stance Harmful"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, February 18--India's response to the 
Clinton remarks on human rights and Kashmir, described by some 
observers as "official" rather than "political," appears on 
second reflection to be confused and vacillating, if not 
downright weak. At the time of the Raphel controversy, the 
official aide memoire had not only characterised the 
American position as being a "qualitative shift" but "an 
excessively negative policy assertion." If an assistant 
secretary's remarks had occasioned such strong language, it is 
indeed surprising that the American president's own record of 
insensitivity to Indian concerns are meriting such polite 
responses. 
  The press statement issued in New Delhi on Wednesday, in 
fact, goes out of its way to signal to the United States that 
while something has to be said about President Clinton's 
tendency to appear to be rooting for Pakistan, the United States 
need not take it amiss because as it notes "India shares 
President Clinton's strong interest in reducing tension in South 
Asia ..." In the light of the comfort that anti-Indian elements 
in Kashmir and Punjab have got from the president's remarks 
beginning with his lumping Kashmir as an area where civil war 
was taking place, to his expression of common concern over human 
rights in that state with the country which has supplied the 
insurgents there with direction, training and weapons, South 
Block's pussilanimity is bound to encourage rather than 
discourage the White House in persisting with its tilt. There 
can be no doubt of the encouragement that the remarks will give 
to sundry terrorists, insurgents and nations like Pakistan who 
have a grouse against India. 
  Remarkably, the Indian response has failed to highlight the 
major gap in President Clinton's remarks as well as what ought 
to be the major thrust of its own policy pinpointing the role of 
Pakistan as an abettor of state-sponsored terrorism. New Delhi's 
failure in convincing America, and indeed the world, of this is 
not because it lacks evidence of Pakistani actions, but that it 
is unable to find courage to express its outrage at events like 
the Bombay blasts, or the continued support for cross-border 
terrorism from Pakistan. 
  Though 1993, especially after a series of statements and 
actions from Washington D.C., began to indicate that a 
pro-Pakistan tilt was emerging, officials in New Delhi have been 
advocating that India turn the other check so as to move ahead 
on an agenda which benefits India such as trade, investment, 
technology transfer and even a dialogue on non-proliferation 
issues. Unfortunately, they have permitted the United States to 
push its own skewed agenda which is being perceived by many to 
be inimical to India's sovereignty. Instead of finessing India's 
most important, and in a sense, difficult relationship, South 
Block seems to be responding in a confused and ad hoc fashion 
which is only likely to see increased American meddling since 
no one has bothered to spell out any Indian bottom line in its 
relationship with the United States till now. 
  A major weakness of the Indian response has been its 
excessively defensive tone. In the world of 
realpolitik it signifies that either India is weak or 
that its case is. Considering the access being given to foreign 
diplomats, and most recently the International Red Cross to 
visit Kashmir, such a posture towards Washington appears 
strange. India is involved in fighting a difficult battle in 
Kashmir. Foreigners, including Americans who have seen the 
difficulties faced in Somalia and Bosnia are reacting not so 
much to India's record, which is middling-to-bad in Kashmir, but 
its defensiveness, which in some eyes betokens a weakness which 
can be exploited. 
  Almost egregiously, Wednesday's statement has made claims on 
India's nuclear posture that require some clarification from the 
government. In responding to its observation that "Pakistan's 
nuclear intentions are well-known and confirmed time and again," 
the statement declares "India neither has nor intends to acquire 
weapons of mass destruction." This is an extraordinarily 
definitive statement which appears to be at variance with the 
much more ambiguous, and therefore deterrent, posture adopted by 
the government till now that it will do whatever needed for the 
defence of the country, and its unstated belief that its 
unsafeguarded nuclear power programme and proven nuclear 
capacity are its real insurance against nuclear adventurism, not 
brave words.

<F P=106> [Article by Sanjaya Baru: "Indian Stress on Human Rights at </F>
U.N. Summit"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, February 18--India has declared its 
commitment to the "eradication of poverty by the end of the 
century," emphasised the importance of the "political 
sustainability of economic reforms" and has called for the shift 
of "power to the people" in its presentations at the first 
substantive session of the preparatory committee of the world 
summit for social development at the United Nations headquarters 
in New York last week. 
  In its statement on "A vision for the summit," India stated 
that poverty was a challenge for all mankind, and not merely the 
problem of the developing countries. India reiterated its 
commitment to human rights and emphasised that the concept must 
include "human security" which implied the rights to work, food 
and nutrition, education, health and shelter. 
  Significantly, the Indian statement also added: "While 
talking of sustainable economic growth, recognition must be 
given for political sustainability of economic reforms in the 
context of social consequences if the essential aspirations of 
the poor and the deprived are not pari passu taken 
care of, for fulfilment of these aspirations are absolutely 
fundamental to the stability of the developing world." 
  The U.N. social summit is scheduled for 1996 in Copenhagen. 
At last week's first PrepComm meetings in New York, Indian 
interventions were on five themes, namely, on the political 
declaration, on eradication of poverty, on expansion of 
productive employment, on social integration and on the role of 
the UN and the international financial institutions. The Indian 
statements were drafted with the concurrence of the Prime 
Minister's Office. 
  Emphasising the vital role of decentralisation of 
governance, 
the official Indian position underscored the role of the 
panchayati raj institutions as well as non-governmental 
organisations in "empowering people." 
  The statement says: "The lead role of the national 
governments in the developing world at all times in the matter 
of poverty eradication, in promoting social integration and 
sustained and sustainable full employment, and in creating the 
emvironment needed in terms of resource allocation and relevant 
policies should be emphasised but with the knowledge that the 
state and government structures cannot successfully handle all 
problems of social development and that, therefore, at all times 
their vision should keep the people at the centre of the 
strategies of implementation so that people themselves are 
enabled and empowered through organisations of the poor, on the 
basis of awareness generation and empowerment techniques, 
assisted by the support structures provided by non-government 
and voluntary organisations, to deal with their own problems. In 
other words, a bottom-up approach with people at the Centre, 
with power to the people." 
  While acknowledging the helpful role that the World Bank has 
played in supporting social development programmes in India, the 
Indian statement on the role of the UN and its agencies is also 
critical of the impact that Fund-Bank inspired adjustment 
programmes have had on social sector spending. "We have a 
suspicion that the Fund or the Bank do not overly bother how 
deficits are cut so long as they are indeed cut. That is no way 
of helping the poor while simultaneously pleading lack of 
resources for new programmes, especially on the soft window--the 
IDA resources," says the statement. 
  In a hard-hitting passage read in New York but clearly 
intended for audiences at the IMF and the World Bank in 
Washington, D.C., the Indian delegate said: "There can be no 
deliberate, cold, dispassionate divorce of the micro needs of 
the poor from the macro needs of the economy. They have to go 
hand in hand and hence there is need for additional resources on 
soft terms for social development programmes. 
  "The Bank should not win battles while losing the war. For, 
the war against poverty is about 50 percent of the people of the 
underdeveloped world, while the main thrust and results 
projected from the economic reforms at least 
initially--initially could even mean a decade--seem to be about 
15 percent to 20 percent of the population of the developing 
countries. Let us not have souths and norths within the south 
itself." 
  Drawing attention to the problem of mass unemployment in a 
populous developing economy like India, the Indian statement 
emphasised the role of "labour-intensive" industrialisation, of 
land reforms, peasant agriculture, self-employment schemes and 
the growth of the informal sector. 
  "But all this will have to be supported by 
productivity-raising technology," says the statement, adding: 
"And hence the importance of the role of governments and of 
support structures, including the giant corporations, which 
could play a very fulfilling and, in enlightened self-interest, 
perhaps also a profitable role as support structures." 
  India has asked for a special fund to be created by the Bank 
to assist governments tide over the problems of adjustment, 
poverty-eradication and creation of full employment. While the 
government will allow foreign investment to replace public 
investment in industry, it still requires international aid to 
enhance public expenditure on social sectors, says the Indian 
statement.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 22--Mongolia considered Kashmir as 
an integral part of India and any outstanding issues between 
India and Pakistan should be "resolved within the ambit of the 
Shimla agreement, bilaterally." 
  This Mongolian position was conveyed by the visiting 
President, Mr Pansalmaagiyn Ochirbat, in unambiguous terms here 
on Tuesday to the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, during 
their meeting on Tuesday morning. 
  The Mongolian leader further felt that India's peaceful and 
non-violent approach was something to be emulated by the whole 
world. 
  The two leaders felt that bilateral cooperation between the 
two countries must be strengthened for mutual benefit and 
advantage. Mr Narasimha Rao referred to the joint committee now 
being set up at the just concluded round of summit talks would 
promote co-operation in the economic, science and technology 
areas. He further expressed the hope the joint committee would 
not only implement the decisions taken but should also identify 
new areas of cooperation. 
  The two leaders also discussed regional issues and felt that 
regional cooperation in Asia should be strengthened. 
  They also discussed the possibilities of cooperation in 
different areas such as, mining including exploration of uranium 
reserves in Mongolia, oil deposits, and agriculture and agreed 
that details should be worked out by the just set-up joint 
committee. 
  The two countries on Tuesday signed a treaty on friendly 
relations and co-operation between the two countries and four 
other agreements--(a) for establishing of a joint committee for 
economic commercial and science and technological cooperation, 
(b) avoidance of double taxation, (c) cultural exchange 
programme, 1994-96, and (d) cooperation in health, 1994-96. 
  Addressing a 40-minute press conference later in the day, 
the 
Mongolian President asserted that his visit to India "is very 
successful." With his meeting with the President, Dr Shankar 
Dayal Sharma, on Monday and the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, on Tuesday, his delegation has completed "main 
political agenda." He attached great importance to the 
strengthening of Mongolia's bilateral ties with India. He also 
attached paramount importance to the just signed treaty of 
friendly relations and cooperation as well as the setting up of 
the joint committee. 
  He pointed out that his country has great reserves of 
uranium 
and petroleum, and Mongolia is prepared to undertake 
feasibility studies with any country, including India. In reply 
to a specific question about possible Indian participation, the 
Mongolian leader's forthright reply was that his country "has no 
reservation with regard to any country.

  [Text] Bombay, Feb. 24--India and Mongolia have agreed on 
the avoidance of double taxation. This was revealed by the 
Mongolian President, Mr Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, in a reception 
accorded to him at the inauguration of the Indo-Mongolian 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Indo-Mongolian 
Friendship Society. 
  Mongolia is into its third year of democracy and has opened 
up its economy to foreign investment. Seventy years of communist 
rule had isolated them from the rest of the world and the 
country grew up in the shadow of neighbouring Russia and China. 
Mongolia has a population of 2.2 million and a land area of 1.5 
million square kilometers. 
  Being a rural economy with animal husbandry and agriculture 
as its mainstay, it is looking for technological support from 
India in mining and processing of their vast resources in coking 
coal, silver, copper, gold and molybdenum, building construction 
and joint exploration of petroleum and uranium, power, 
communications and rail and road construction in the 
infrastructure sector. 
  Mongolia imported over $399 million in 1992 and can form a 
market for Indian tea, medicines, kerosene, automobiles, 
textiles, chemicals and fertilizers. Joint ventures and projects 
are still in the negotiation stage, according to a member of the 
trade team and they hope to finalise them soon. 
  Meanwhile, the Mongolian President today visited the 
century-old Bombay stock exchange and witnessed the trading 
activity. 
  The Mongolian delegation was received by the executive 
director of the BSE [Bombay Stock Exchange], Mr A.N. Kolhatkar, 
and the president, Mr G.B. Desai.

  [Text] New Delhi, February 25. India and Singapore 
commenced a four-day joint naval training exercise in 
anti-submarine warfare (ASW) manoeuvres in the Andaman Sea from 
Wednesday. 
  The training exercise, which is scheduled to end tomorrow, 
is 
being held on the specific request by Singapore which had 
formally approached the Indian government last December. The 
visiting Singapore ships had arrived India last Monday on a 
seven-day official visit. 
  The participating ships of the Singapore Navy are RSN 
Victory 
and RSN Valour, both missile Corvettes. 
  These two corvettes, designed by a German firm, were built 
in 
Singapore as recently as in 1991. The participating Indian naval 
vessels are INS Taragiri, an indigenously built Leander class 
frigate of British design and INS Kursura, a Soviet made Foxtrot 
class submarine. 
  The joint naval exercise has been described by defence 
ministry sources as a "naval exercise of significant training 
value for the Singapore navy". The ASW manoeuvres being taught 
to the crew of the Singapore navy ships include that of sonar 
operator training, and sharpening skills at detection and 
designation of oceanic and underwater targets, especially 
submarines. 
  This is the first time that a submarine of the Indian navy 
is 
participating in bilateral joint naval exercises involving the 
sensitive ASW operations. 
  Significantly, Singapore has shown interest in seeking 
India's help for specialised training of its naval officers. The 
Singapore navy chief who is arriving in New Delhi early next 
month on his first visit in recent years has specially sought to 
visit naval facilities at the Eastern Naval Command in Cochin. 
  Although a few vacancies for foreign trainees at the Indian 
training establishments are being availed by the Singapore navy, 
the Indian navy expanding the scope of training officers of the 
Singapore navy in the near future is thus emerging as a strong 
probability. 
  This is the second time that India and Singapore are holding 
bilateral naval exercises. The two sides had held a four-day 
tactical joint naval exercise off the coast of the Andaman 
Islands in February last year. 
  The exercises, which were elementary in nature, had included 
surface shooting and screening apart from other manoeuvres.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb. 23 (PTI)--The dollar value of trade 
between India and China almost doubled in the course of 1993, to 
$673 million, according to Chinese customs statistics. 
  While overall bilateral trade grew by 98.9 percent, India's 
exports to China expanded by an even larger margin, that is 170 
percent, from $181 million in 1992 to $417 million in 1993, the 
Chinese figures showed. 
  The figures include trade through Hong Kong. China 
selectively includes or excludes the Hong Kong figures depending 
on its need to play down its own massive surplus vis-a-vis other 
countries and highlight an occasional surplus enjoyed by some of 
them. 
  The United States, west European countries, Japan and others 
regularly complain of deficits running into tens of billions of 
dollars annually in their trade with China. 
  India had for more than a decade and a half suffered a wide 
deficit in its trade with China but the sale of iron ore and 
steel needed by China's burgeoning construction industry over 
the past couple of years altered the situation. Indian imports 
from China last year grew by 63 percent, from $158 million in 
1992 to $259 million, the Chinese figures showed. 
  Bilateral trade is keeping to an `encouraging upswing', 
diplomatic sources here commented, pointing to a 7.28-percent 
increase in 1991, 28.6 percent in 1992 and 98.9 percent last 
year, as per Chinese figures. 
  There is good reason to hope that Sino-Indian trade value 
will cross the $1-billion mark, they said. However, that figure 
will still remain a fraction of 1 percent in China's total trade. 
  China has bid for launching an Indian satellite and, if it 
succeeds, that will significantly boost the payments accruing to 
it. 
  While iron ore has, for many years, been a significant item 
in India's sales to China, steel emerged as an entirely new 
item, and the largest one, last year, amounting to $177.5 
million. 
  Although China's construction industry is trying to cool its 
over-heated growth, the demand is expected to continue growing 
though at a slower rate, the sources said.

  [Text] New Delhi, February 17--India is open to a dialogue 
with Pakistan despite the intense propaganda barrage launched by 
that country on alleged human rights excesses in Kashmir, an 
official spokesman said today. 
  He said India is endeavouring to inform the world about 
Pakistan's efforts to gain propaganda mileage out of the Kashmir 
issue by projecting the state as a separate entity. Pakistan is 
more concerned about its political agenda rather than the issue 
of human rights, he added. 
  The spokesman said that Islamabad's vituperative language 
against this country is not conducive towards good bilateral 
relations. 
  Asked to comment on press reports about a forthcoming visit 
by the controversial U.S. State Department official, Ms Robin 
Raphel, the spokesman declined to comment. 
  India today warned Pakistan that the foreign secretary level 
dialogue will suffer a serious setback if Islamabad went ahead 
and moved a resolution on Kashmir at the U.N. human rights 
commission in Geneva. 
  An external affairs ministry spokesman said if Pakistan 
presses ahead with its resolution it would jeopardise 
continuance of the bilateral dialogue. 
  The spokesman said India was committed to resolving its 
differences with Pakistan through mutual consultations. The 
Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao, has reiterated India's 
commitment for a peaceful comprehensive dialogue with Pakistan 
on all outstanding matters, including the Kashmir issue. 
  The spokesman expressed the hope that Pakistan would not 
insist on moving the resolution at the human rights commission 
meetings. 
  He said all our missions have briefed the member countries 
of 
the commission about the Pakistan's designs and intentions. "We 
are hopeful that these nations see through transparent 
propaganda of Pakistan behind the resolution." 
  The minister of state for external affairs, Mr Salman 
Khursheed, held a meeting with the ambassador of the member 
nations of the commission here yesterday, during which he stated 
that Pakistan had no locus standi to move the resolution on 
human rights when its own record on the issue was imperfect. 
  Mr Khursheed said India was always ready to have a dialogue 
with Pakistan under the Shimla Agreement. Six proposals were 
sent to Pakistan in January in the hope that agreement on these 
issue would create an atmosphere of confidence between the two 
countries. 
  But regrettably there was no formal response from the 
Pakistan government, he added. 
  Meanwhile, the external affairs ministry today ruled out the 
possibility of any immediate visit to the United States by Mr 
Rao. 
  "There is nothing to talk about it as yet. No diplomatic 
moves are afoot," the ministry spokesman said at his press 
briefing.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 22--In a development of 
extraordinary significance, the implications of which should not 
be lost on Pakistan and the United States, the two Houses of 
Parliament on Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution which 
expressed national determination to resist all attempts to 
destabilise India in respect of Kashmir. 
  The "Hands-off-Kashmir" resolution was adopted 24 hours 
after 
the President, Dr Shankar Dayal Sharma, in his address to the 
joint session of the two Houses of Parliament had warned that 
"any attempt to destabilise India either from across the border 
or from any other quarter would be foiled." Consistent with 
reiterating that Jammu and Kashmir "has been, is, and shall 
remain" an integral part of India, asserted that India had the 
will and capacity to firmly counter all designs against its 
unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
  The motion, read out by the presiding officers of both 
Houses, was passed without any discussion to the thumping of 
desks, showing that all the political parties were with the 
government on this issue. 
  The two-page resolution demanded that Pakistan vacate areas 
of the Indian State, which they have occupied through aggression 
and regretted the pitiable conditions and violations of human 
rights and denial of democratic rights and freedom to the people 
in the area. 
  The strongly-worded resolution charged Pakistan with 
abetting 
terrorism in the Indian State through imparting training to 
terrorists in camps located in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied 
Kashmir (PoK), supply of weapons and funds and assistance to the 
terrorists infiltrating into the Valley with the avowed purpose 
of creating disorder, disharmony and subversion. 
  The resolution called upon Islamabad to put an end to these 
activities forthwith. These activities were in violation of the 
Shimla agreement, the internationally accepted norms of 
inter-State conduct and the Geneva declaration to which Pakistan 
is a signatory. Stating that this was the root cause of tension 
between the two countries, the resolution declared that the 
Indian political and democratic structures and the Constitution 
provided for firm guarantees for the promotion and protection of 
human rights of all its citizens. 
  There had been much concern in political circles at the 
recent attempts by Pakistan to internationalise the Kashmir 
issue. The concern was voiced at the two rounds of meetings the 
Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Mr V.C. Shukla, held with 
leaders of different political parties in Parliament last week. 
The main Opposition party in Parliament, the Bharatiya Janata 
Party (BJP), which first broached the subject, had informed the 
minister of its proposal to move a resolution in this regard. 
Following expression of similar sentiments from other parties, 
it was felt that they should all be part to a single resolution 
so as to send the proper signals across the border. 
  Differences, however, cropped up about the wording of the 
resolution, with the National Front and Left parties insisting 
that the United States be identified by name for its role in the 
matter of terrorism in Kashmir. Unanimity also eluded the 
leaders on the question of adopting the resolution without a 
discussion in the event of it being a government-sponsored one. 
It was then decided that the resolution be moved by the Speaker 
in the Lok Sabha and the Chairman in the Rajya Sabha. The 
resolution, which incorporates the views and feelings of all the 
parties, does not, however, identify the United States by name. 
  Following is the text of the resolution: 
  This House notes with deep concern Pakistan's role in 
imparting training to the terrorists in camps located in 
Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK), the supply of 
weapons and funds, assistance in infiltration of trained 
terrorists, including foreign mercenaries into Jammu and Kashmir 
with the avowed purpose of creating disorder, disharmony and 
subversion: 
  --reiterates that the terrorists trained in Pakistan are 
indulging in murder, loot and other heinous crimes against the 
people taking them hostage and creating an atmosphere of terror; 
  --condemns strongly the continued abetment and encouragement 
Pakistan is extending to subversive and terrorist activities in 
the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir; 
  --calls upon Pakistan to stop forthwith its support to 
terrorism, which is in violation of the Shimla agreement, the 
internationally accepted norms of inter-State conduct and the 
Geneva declaration to which Pakistan is a signatory. This is in 
fact the root cause of tension between the two countries; 
  --reiterates that the Indian political and democratic 
structures and the Constitution provide for firm guarantees for 
the promotion and protection of human rights of all its citizens; 
  --regards Pakistan's anti-India campaign of calumny and 
falsehood as unacceptable and deplorable; 
  --notes with deep concern the highly provocative statements 
emanating from Pakistan and urges Pakistan to refrain from 
making statements which vitiate the atmosphere; 
  --expresses regret and concern at the pitiable conditions 
and 
violations of human rights and denial of democratic rights and 
freedom of the people in those areas of the Indian State of 
Jammu and Kashmir, which are under the illegal occupation of 
Pakistan; 
  --firmly reiterates, on behalf of the people of India, that: 
(a) The State of Jammu and Kashmir has been, is, and shall be an 
integral part of India and any attempts to separate it from the 
rest of the country will be resisted by India by all necessary 
means; (b) India has the will and capacity to firmly counter all 
designs against its unity, sovereignty and territorial 
integrity; (c) Pakistan should vacate the areas of the Indian 
State of Jammu and Kashmir, which they have occupied through 
aggression; (d) Any attempt from any quarter to interfere in the 
internal affairs of India will be met resolutely.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb 22 (UNI)--Parliament on Tuesday 
approved the promulgation of President's rule in the 
northeastern State of Manipur on new year's eve. 
  Both Houses of Parliament approved the statutory resolutions 
through a voice vote. 
  Replying to the brief debate, in the Lok Sabha, the Union 
Home Minister, Mr S.B. Chavan, made it clear that secessionist 
activities in the northeastern region would not be tolerated, 
but at the same time, the government would leave no stone 
unturned to remove the feeling of neglect and alienation among 
the people. 
  The Minister of State for Home, Mr P.M. Sayeed, who replied 
to the debate in the Rajya Sabha informed the members that 
integrated approach to tackle the problem of insurgency in the 
region was the need of the hour. 
  The Home Minister, Mr S.B. Chavan assured the Lok Sabha that 
every effort would be made to remove the feeling of neglect and 
alienation in the North-East, but at the same time any 
secessionist activities would not be tolerated. 
  "The government is prepared to give any amount of money for 
the socio-economic development of the northeastern region, 
provided they utilise the money properly," Mr Chavan said while 
replying to the debate on the approval of the proclamation of 
President's rule. 
  The recent meeting of the North-Eastern Council had promised 
all assistance to the growth and development of the region, 
although non-plan expenditure was required. 
  Mr Chavan said he had separate meetings with Chief Ministers 
and Governors of all northeastern States. Several projects which 
had been taken up during the fifth and sixth plans were still 
not completed. 
  The government had now decided not to recover any loan 
sanctioned for any projects in the N-E States, he said. 
  "We have made just a beginning," Mr Chavan said and told the 
House that several sectoral meetings were being planned to 
monitor the development. 
  Referring to secessionism, Mr Chavan said the government's 
priority was to win over the hearts of the local people. The 
government would not hesitate to take action against those 
indulging in secessionism, the Home Minister asserted. 
  He said complaints of corruption would be looked into and 
severe action taken against those involved. 
  Participating in a debate, Mr Jaswant Singh (BJP [Bharatiya 
Janata Party]) said if the government had intervened in time in 
Manipur, the killing of a number of people could have been 
avoided. 
  The substantial funds provided for the economic development 
of the North-East was not properly utilised. Corruption was one 
of the major factors for the alienation of the people, he added. 
  Mr Mohan Singh (JD [Janata Dal]) urged the government to 
curb 
the activities of Pakistan which through Bangladesh was 
providing assistance to extremist forces in the North-East. Prof 
M Kampson (Cong-I [Congress (I)]) urged the government to take 
an initiative for promoting a dialogue to solve the problem of 
insurgency in the North-East. 
  Mr Uddhab Barman (CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist]) 
demanded that the State Assembly should be dissolved and the 
political process initiated so that a popular government could 
be installed at the earliest. Extortions, drug trafficking, 
smuggling and killings were rampant in Manipur. AIDS was also 
spreading in a big way, he added. 
  Mr Kabindra Purkayastha (BJP) said the State government had 
no control over the hill district which was under the sway of 
insurgents and extremists. The insurgency in the North-East was 
a major threat to national integration. The insurgents had camps 
and training facilities in Bangladesh, he said. 
  Mr Sriballav Panigrahi (Cong-I) said there was nothing wrong 
in keeping the Assembly in suspended animation. According to 
him, there was improvement in the law and order situation in the 
State. Political parties should help strengthen law and order so 
that normalcy could be restored in Manipur. 
  Mr Viswanath Shastri (CPI [Communist Party of India]) said 
the police forces in Manipur should be reorganised to restore 
the peoples confidence. He stressed the need for fulfilling the 
aspirations of different groups of people there. 
  Mr George Fernandes (JD) said unemployment, drug addiction 
and AIDS were serious problems facing the northeastern region 
and the government would have to adopt suitable measures to 
overcome them. 
  Mr Kirip Chaliha (Cong-I) said unlike other parts of the 
country, the northeast people had no caste barrier. They were 
very much alive to the practical problems and would remain in 
the mainstream. 
  Mr Chitta Basu (FB [Forward Bloc]) said N-E should get 
special attention of the government and reminded that forces of 
secessionism was growing in the region.

  [Text] Sabroom (Tripura) Feb. 15--The much-awaited 
repatriation of Chakma refugees today took place in the border 
town of South Tripura, amidst assurances from the Bangladesh 
Government that their safety and security would be ensured, 
reports PTI. 
  Seventy seven families from the Kathalcharri evacuee camp 
here numbering 282 refugees trekked over a bamboo bridge erected 
temporarily by Bangladesh to Ramgarh on the other side. 
  Assuring the refugees of safety and security, the Bangladesh 
minister for communication, Col (retd) Ole Ahmed, who came over 
to Sabroom to participate in a meeting organised by the Indian 
Government, said, "We are prepared to do everything to make 
their resettlement smooth. I ensure them that they are not going 
to an area of uncertainty but only to their home." 
  Describing this as a "unique and historic" event the Tripura 
governor, Mr Romesh Bhandari who played an active role, said 
there was no reason to doubt the genuineness and sincerity of 
these assurances of the Bangladesh Government. 
  The governor however said that such fears and apprehensions 
that were being expressed, needed to be taken note of by "our 
Bangladesh friends. In the initial stages particular attention 
would need to be paid on this count so that apprehension and 
fear could be replaced by confidence and trust. 
  The Union of state for home, Mr P.M. Sayeed, who also 
described this event as "historic" said that India had accepted 
them when they came here following atrocities and killings, but 
it had been at a considerable cost to the people of Tripura. 
  The Centre, he said, had given them free rations and spent 
over Rs [Rupees] 43 crores for their upkeep. 
  Mr Sayeed said, "We have not involved any third country and 
we have shown that we can solve our problem by ourselves.

  [Text] Bahrain, February 14--The Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, has said that India attached top priority to 
improving its relations with Pakistan and denied that New Delhi 
was trying to play the role of a policeman in the region, PTI 
reports. 
  However, Pakistan's support, encouragement and abetment of 
terrorism directed against India "is a matter of deep concern... 
We find this support totally unacceptable and believe that it is 
the basic cause of bilateral tensions and regional disquiet," he 
said in an interview with Saudi Arabia's leading Arabic daily, 
OKAZ. 
  "India attaches high priority in its foreign policy to 
improving relations with the neighbours, including Pakistan," Mr 
Rao said. The Prime Minister said India was keen to resolve all 
differences with Pakistan peacefully through bilateral 
negotiations, in accordance with the Shimla agreement. 
  As a result, Mr Rao said, the foreign secretaries of the two 
countries met in Islamabad in the beginning of the year. 
  Referring to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr Rao 
said: 
"The assistance to terrorism by Pakistan is at the heart of the 
problem." He denied that the security forces in Kashmir were 
using excessive force and said: "We have gone to great lengths 
to ensure that our security forces use the minimum possible 
force against cilivians." 
  Side by side, Mr Rao said, attempts were on to revive the 
political process in the state. "This process is understandably 
slow, because of the intimidatory tactics of the militants," he 
added. 
  In reply to a question, the Prime Minister denied that India 
ever "sought to play the role of a policeman in the region." On 
India's growing ties with Israel, Mr Rao said it had no 
strategic or security dimension. "There is no question of its 
being directed against any third country," he added. 
  Referring to the demolition of Babri Masjid he said he was 
aware of the reverberations abroad on the incident and mentioned 
his government's prompt action in dismissing the state 
government responsible for it. 
  He said while the government was prosecuting those involved 
in the demolition, it had referred the matter to the supreme 
court and would abide by its decision.

  [Text] New Delhi, February 19--The Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today told the representatives of foreign and 
Indian companies collaborating in joint venture projects that 
the country required higher and quicker investment flows 
particularly in the critical infrastructure sector. 
  While assuring them that the government was committed to 
continuing the process of economic reforms started in 1991, Mr 
Rao sought to allay any misgivings about problems arising due to 
red tape or procedures. "The government will effect the 
necessary changes with regard to procedural matters in the 
quickest practicable time," he observed. 
  Mr Rao did not think that the problems and irritants coming 
in the way of speedy implementation of the joint venture 
projects were not of an insurmountable nature and said the 
suggestions made would be considered on merits. 
  He said he attached importance to a proper feedback from 
business, industry and trade pertaining to their experiences in 
undertaking economic activities in the new environment in this 
country. He felt this meeting provided a good opportunity for a 
frank exchange of views and said such dialogues would be held at 
regular intervals by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board 
(FIPB). 
  After giving a patient hearing to specific problems raised 
by 
the foreign and Indian companies, the Prime Minister said some 
adjustments would have to be made to streamline the functioning 
of several authorities including customs and excise and making 
investment procedures simple. 
  At the end of the meeting lasting more than 90 minutes, Mr 
Rao said his impression was that those who had already made 
substantial investment in this country encountered fewer 
problems. At the same time, those who were now keen or 
contemplating investing in this country seemed to be conjuring 
problems in their minds, he remarked. 
  He reiterated that economic liberalisation was here to stay 
and said the response to the new policies both within and 
outside the country were very encouraging. 
  The representatives of the Indian and foreign companies 
acknowledged that India had emerged as a major player on the 
global economic firmament in the wake of the economic reforms 
over the last 30 months. Some of them whose projects were in an 
advanced stage of completion said the Centre's help of providing 
counter guarantee had turned the climate for financial 
assistance in India's favour. They expressed satisfaction that 
investment procedures had been streamlined especially the FIPB 
route and agreed to keep the FIPB posted about the progress 
achieved in the implementation of their projects. 
  Stating that they would seek the FIPB's assistance in 
resolving difficulties faced by them during the period of 
implementation of their projects, the company representatives 
drew the government's pointed attention to cumbersome details 
sought in the financial statements. 
  The government explained that it was proposed to amend the 
Company Law and an indepth exercise was already on to overhaul 
some of these provisions. It also promised to look into the 
problems of varied interpretation of the Urban Land Ceiling Act 
by the state government in transferring land to the companies 
for starting joint ventures. 
  The minister of state for industry, Mrs Krishna Shahi, 
responded saying there was already a mechanism for monitoring 
this aspect and officials of her ministry were interacting 
closely with the state government to sort out the difficulties 
at the implementation stage. 
  These representatives of foreign and Indian companies 
further 
spoke of problems in securing financial packages because of the 
norms and procedures of the Reserve Bank of India and financial 
institutions and varying rates of duty and taxes for a 
Non-resident Indians (NRI) compared to others. 
  What these companies found worrisome was the implementation 
of the Customs and excise laws and underlined the need for 
greater transparency. They wanted to know if the structure of 
Customs and excise levies could be simplified and the existing 
list reduced.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 27--The CPI(M) [Communist Party of 
India-Marxist] politburo today condemned the Pakistani 
government and its resolution on Kashmir placed before the 
United Nations Human Rights Commission at Geneva. It also 
accused the Clinton administration of attempting to pressurise 
the Indian Government. 
  "The latest statement by President Clinton endorsing 
Pakistan's charges about human rights violations in Kashmir is 
part of a calculated plan to pressurise the Indian Government," 
charged the CPI(M) general secretary, Mr. Harkishen Singh 
Surjeet, while addressing a press conference here today. "The 
effort is also to pit the people of India and Pakistan against 
each other," Mr. Surjeet said. 
  Briefing the press on the deliberations of the three-day 
Politburo meeting that concluded here yesterday, Mr. Surjeet 
reiterated his party's criticism against the Narasimha Rao 
Government, accusing it of following a `weak kneed' policy 
against the U.S. 
  "It is unfortunate that, while making diplomatic protests, 
the Narasimha Rao Government has not criticised the U.S. 
administration's stand on Kashmir either in the President's 
address or in the resolution adopted by both Houses of 
Parliament," said Mr. Surjeet recalling the note of 
clarification given by the CPI(M) MPs [members of Parliament] 
soon after Parliament adopting the historic resolution on 
Kashmir. 
  Logical outcome: Linking the foreign policy 
position to the economic policy, the Politburo statement, added 
the obvious by stating "this weak kneed stance is the logical 
outcome of the surrender to US pressures on the economic front 
and the indiscriminate opening to foreign capital." 
  The statement charged the Government of having done precious 
little "even after three months after the Hazratbal shrine 
crisis was defused." Cautioning the Government against "reliance 
on administrative measures alone," it urged for initiative 
towards a `political solution' to the Kashmir problem. 
  Taking stock of the economic situation, the Politburo 
reiterated its charges against the Congress(I) Government of 
showing gross contempt to parliamentary democracy by 
administering price hikes of essential commodities and petroleum 
products. Mr. Surjeet said the party would persist with its 
mobilisation of the people against the Government against the 
economic policies. 
  `Attack on working class': The decision by the 
Government to amend the labour laws, according to Mr. Surjeet 
`constituted a serious attack on trade union rights and the 
working class.' The Politburo had decided to mobilise large 
numbers for the proposed `march to Parliament' on April 5, Mr. 
Surjeet added. 
  Referring to the Ayodhya dispute and the ongoing hearing in 
Supreme Court on this case, the CPI(M) general secretary said 
his party maintained its opposition to the reference to the 
Supreme Court under Article 143 of the Constitution. "All cases 
connected with the dispute should be referred to the apex court 
for a judicial verdict under Article 138 (2) of the 
Constitution," he said. 
  He also said that his party "hoped that the Uttar Pradesh 
State government would take a stand before the Supreme Court 
similar to that taken by the West Bengal Government." 
  Accusing the Congress(I) of utilising defections to 
"engineer 
a majority in the Lok Sabha," Mr. Surjeet said "the reward of a 
Cabinet post to one of the defectors, Mr. Ram Lakhan Yadav, 
shows Mr. Narasimha Rao's blatant disregard for democratic norms 
and the spirit of the anti-defection laws." 

  -  The three day meeting of the Politburo, also discussed a 
whole range of issues, including the crisis engulfing the 
Karunakaran Government in Kerala and renewed its demand for the 
resignation of Mr. K. Karunakaran and his Cabinet, in the light 
of the CAG's [comptroller and auditor general] indictment on the 
palmolein oil import. 

    The meeting also discussed the party proposal to update the 
party programme, which was decided upon in the last congress of 
the CPI(M) held at Madras in January 1992. The Politburo had a 
joint session with the Programme Commission headed by Mr. 
Surjeet himself to discuss the preparation of a draft updating 
the programme of the party. 
  It was decided that the Politburo meet once again on to 
discuss threadbare the report of the Commission in March, before 
placing the draft in this regard to the Central Committee of the 
party, Mr. Surjeet said.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 14--The Janata Dal [JD] affairs took 
a curious turn today with the party president, Mr. S.R. Bommai 
announcing his decision to quit the post. The former Prime 
Minister, Mr. V.P. Singh, now convalescing in London, was 
nominated by the national executive of the Dal to head the 
party. A resolution to this effect was passed by the executive. 
  However, Mr. Singh's consent is still awaited, despite 
claims 
from sections that the former Prime Minister had agreed to take 
over the reins of the party. Until such time Mr. Singh expresses 
his opinion, Mr. Bommai will continue to lead the party. A new 
president will have to be elected by the general body of the 
party within six months from now, according to the Dal 
constitution. 
  Sources within the party described today's development as 
`part of a concerted move to oust Mr. Bommai and install Mr. Ram 
Vilas Paswan as party president'. According to them, Mr. Singh 
is expected to decline the post and hoist his confidant in place 
of Mr. Bommai. 
  Taken by surprise: Though today's development was 
more or less on expected lines, with powerful sections within 
the Dal gunning for Mr. Bommai, his decision to quit today 
appears to have taken his supporters in the national executive 
by surprise. Speculations are rife of a further split in the 
party, which is already witnessing exodus at local levels. 
  Today's national executive was preceded by a meeting of the 
Political Affairs Committee, where the demand for Mr. Bommai's 
ouster was raised by members, led by the Bihar Chief Minister, 
Mr. Laloo Prasad Yadav. Mr. Bommai's announcement to step down 
was essentially a fallout of this, said partymen. 
  Those who opposed Mr. Bommai's ouster include the Dal 
vice-president, Mr. George Fernandes, and the entire `socialist 
camp' within the party. This camp was closeted in a meeting 
immediately after the executive meeting. The executive is slated 
to continue its deliberations tomorrow, when the Dal's rout in 
the recent elections is expected to come up. 
  Apart from Dal leaders leaving the party to join Mr. Mulayam 
Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, a similar movement of Dal men, 
including some MPs, joining the Congress(I) seem to be on the 
cards. Confirming such an eventuality, a Dal MP from Bihar today 
said "we cannot remain party to this decision and do not intend 
to continue with them." 
  Mr. Bommai told the press that he had offered to quit as 
party president on consideration that Mr. Singh alone was 
capable of retrieving the Dal from the dumps that it is in 
today. "I am a satisfied and contented man today," said Mr. 
Bommai. 
  Though the meeting was slated to discuss a score of issues, 
including the `merger of Dal factions which was initiated at 
Ghazaibad in September 1993', the only business transacted today 
was Mr. Bommai's stepping down. In fact, demands by Orissa Chief 
Minister, Mr. Biju Patnaik, and others that Mr. V.P. Singh's 
consent be obtained before resolving the issue of party 
presidentship, was turned down by vocal sections. 
  Apart from Mr. Patnaik, the move was resented by Mr. 
Ramakrishna Hegde and many others from the southern States. This 
demand, sources said, was `violently' turned down by sections 
led by Mr. Laloo Prasad. 
  `Consent': According to Mr. Bommai, Mr. Laloo 
Prasad claimed that he had spoken to Mr. V.P. Singh on the 
proposal to which he had agreed to. As if to endorse this, Mr. 
Bommai added that he too had expressed such a view to Mr. Singh, 
before his departure to London and "Mr. Singh did not say no."

  [Text] New Delhi, February 18--The government has nominated 
a member on the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) to 
deal exclusively with policy matters relating to export 
promotion in Customs and Central excise areas, and also to 
interact and co-ordinate with the ministry of commerce in such 
matters. 
  Mr K. Vishwanathan will assume charge as member (export 
promotion) with immediate effect. 
  This was one of the decisions arrived at a meeting held by 
the cabinet secretary, Mr Zafar Saifullah, on Thursday with 
secretaries and head of departments of about a dozen ministries 
and official agencies dealing with export-related problems. 
  It was decided that there would be no ceiling on export 
credit where such applications were genuine. All export credit 
applications would be considered without reference to the 10 
percent ceiling in the case of quality borrowers engaged in 
export and all cases of export credit rejection will be required 
to be put up to the chairman of the concerned bank. 
  The meeting decided that a 24-hour customs clearance 
facility 
would be introduced at Delhi, Bombay, Madras and Calcutta 
airports and at Bombay and Madras ports, to begin with, by March 
31. 
  The cabinet secretary reiterated the overriding importance 
of 
exports as a national priority and a collective effort "in which 
each one of us is a player" involving the entire government 
including all connected ministries and agencies. While 
expressing his appreciation of the fact that awareness of the 
need for export promotion was gathering momentum, he was 
categorical that greater efforts were needed at the operating 
levels to translate strategies into action and to ensure prompt 
removal of bottlenecks through effective grievance redressal 
mechanisms. He wanted banks and financial institutions and all 
other connected departments to gear up their style of 
functioning to ensure that export activities were not hindered 
in any manner. 
  The meeting reviewed in detail the action points concerning 
different ministries on export-related problems arising out of 
the last such meeting taken by the cabinet secretary in 
November, 1993. Ministries covered in the meeting included 
agriculture, commerce, telecommunications, civil aviation, 
labour, surface transport, textiles and posts. 
  It was confirmed that a foreign post-office had started 
functioning at Varanasi and foreign post-offices would be opened 
shortly at Surat and Kanpur to cater to the growing need of 
exporters in those areas. 
  The meeting noted that the electronic data interchange (EDI) 
for international trade had already been launched from Bombay 
well ahead of the scheduled deadline of March, 1994 and 
workshops were being held at all major port cities to enthuse 
and educate exporters to link up with the fast emerging EDI 
network. 
  It was indicated that the cabinet secretary would hold two 
follow-up meetings to discuss fiscal and banking issues relating 
to exports after the budget session of Parliament.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 24--The Economic Survey for 1993-94, 
presented to Parliament today, hints at further reforms in 
taxation, subsidies, price control and expenditure, but concedes 
that these basic reforms may not show "immediate dramatic 
results in deficit reduction" from the current year's level 
which is likely to exceed significantly the 1993-94 budget 
estimates. 
  Nevertheless, the survey says, the measures can help ensure 
that control over the fiscal deficit is re-established. 
Referring to the high fiscal deficit during the current 
financial year, the survey points out that "after initial 
success, there is a tendency for fiscal discipline to weaken" as 
happened in many countries which faced a fiscal-cum-balance of 
payment crisis. 
  It notes the success achieved on the balance of payments and 
inflation fronts as also rekindling of growth which is expected 
to be 3.8 percent for 1993-94, nearly two percent less than the 
target. But these encouraging trends, the survey warns, must not 
lead to fiscal laxity. "The alternatives to fiscal 
responsibility and sustained reform will bring higher inflation, 
low growth, recurrent balance of payments problems and the 
accentuation of poverty." The survey, therefore, calls for 
resisting them firmly so as to attain the goals of fast labour 
intensive growth, employment generation and poverty reduction. 
  The need for macro-economic stability by reducing the 
government's revenue expenditure to sustain high rates of 
savings and investment has been repeatedly stressed. A reduction 
in fiscal deficit will also facilitate financial reform by 
eliminating any residual risk of a high interest-fiscal deficit 
spiral. In the medium-term, containment of fiscal deficit would 
entail serious changes in both expenditure and revenue policies. 
Control of major subsidies and effective prioritisation of 
discretionary expenditures is a key issue. 
  While broadening of the tax-base is necessary to contain 
fiscal deficits, moving towards the ideals of a national value 
added tax and ad valorem import duty is also considered 
essential for putting Indian producers on a par with foreign 
competitors. 
  Among other important issues and priorities highlighted by 
the survey are: changes in legislative and administrative 
framework to facilitate restructuring of industry, elimination 
of rigidities in labour laws, attracting foreign direct 
investment, phasing out import licensing and high tariffs. 
Shifting the composition of external finance from borrowing to 
direct equity investment, and from short-term and government 
guaranteed government debt to long-term debt with minimum 
reliance on government guarantee, prudent management of external 
debt and foreign exchange reserves, reforms in pricing, cost 
recovery and institutional changes in the infrastructure 
sector. The survey also emphasises the need for shifting 
composition of public expenditure in agriculture from input 
subsidies to creation and maintenance of infrastructure. 
  The survey notes several plus points during the current 
financial year as fruits of the reform initiatives. The year is 
likely to end with foreign exchange reserves of about $12 
billion and a current account deficit of less than 0.5 percent 
of GDP. An inflow of over $2.5 billion on account of foreign 
direct and equity portfolio investments is expected by the end 
of this financial year, with much higher inflows likely next 
year. 
  The monetary effects of large capital inflows may pose a new 
challenge for the country's monetary policy for the first time 
in recent history. In 1991-92, foreign exchange inflows added 
about Rs 11,000 crores to reserve money and in 1993-94, this 
increase may be of the order of Rs 16,000 crores. "The 
contribution is likely to increase next year and we must be 
prepared to meet this challenge," the survey observes. 
  A conscious policy is being followed to reduce the quantum 
of 
short-term external debt as a result of the marked improvement 
in foreign exchange reserves. The share of short-term debt in 
the total debt stock fell from 10.2 percent in March 1991 to 
seven percent in March 1993. The increase in external debt 
averaged about $3 billion in both 1991-92 and 1992-93, but in 
the first half of 1993-94, the increase was limited to less than 
$300 million. 
  In the first nine months of 1993-94, export growth rose to 
19.9 percent in dollar terms while imports declined by 1.3 
percent. The deficit in the current account at 0.5 percent of 
GDP is also sustainable. While all this provides a very sound 
basis to put the balance payments position on a stable path in 
the medium-term, concerted policy action is required to ensure 
that exports maintain their growth rate in the medium-term and 
the trade deficit is not allowed to widen despite the likely 
recovery in imports during 1994-95. 
  The survey also notes that debt servicing is expected to 
peak 
in 1996-97. Because of the large interest and principal 
repayments, a substantial financing gap may be expected to 
remain in the coming three years. In this connection, the survey 
refers to the issue of taking a medium-term loan from the IMF 
under the extended fund facility (EFF) and says that while some 
talks have been held, a decision will be taken keeping in view 
the emerging balance of payments position. 
  The overall industrial growth during the first seven months 
of 1993-94 has been only 1.6 percent. The growth rate, though 
registering discernible improvement since July 1993, is below 
the expectation, the survey concedes. But it finds indications 
of an industrial revival due to several factors on both the 
supply and demand side. These factors include successive good 
agricultural performance, high growth of exports, a buoyant 
infrastructural sector, enhancement in public spending on social 
sectors and a substantial increase in foreign investment. Demand 
conditions are also favourable, indicating an industrial growth 
rate of around 4 percent for 1993-94. The survey, however, 
admits that due to a number of factors, "the industrial sector 
is yet to respond with full vigour to liberalisation measures." 
  Turning to agriculture, the survey says that despite a good 
year, agricultural production will show slower growth in 1993-94 
because of the peak levels attained in 1992-93. But the 
production of wheat and rice is likely to grow this year. 
Foodgrains stocks at 22.8 million tonnes at the end of December, 
1993 were at their highest level in seven years. 
  The survey expresses concern at the price situation. Though 
the annual inflation rate stood at 8.2 percent (provisional) on 
January 29 this year, the fiscal and monetary situation was 
fuelling inflation. Because of the increased administered prices 
at the end of January and early February, "control of inflation 
once again emerges as an area of priority concern." 
  It therefore, observes: "In the coming year, containment and 
reduction in the rate of inflation will depend on measures for 
containing the fiscal deficit and reducing the potential for 
monetary expansion, recovery of industrial production and the 
management of the supply of foodgrains and other key essential 
commodities."

  [Text] New Delhi, February 24--The Economic Survey of 
1993-94 calls for a special policy thrust to maintain the export 
growth and encourage non-debt creating capital inflows 
(remittances and investment) aimed at putting the country's 
balance of payments (BoP) position on a stable path during the 
next three years. 
  In a review of the external sector of the economy, the 
survey 
says performance during the year has amply demonstrated the 
benefits of the reforms and this should strengthen the resolve 
to press ahead with them. 
  The survey finds that a sound basis has been created to 
further deregulate the external sector and rationalise the 
tariff structure. It expects export growth to be 20 percent in 
dollar terms during 1993-94 and the year to end with foreign 
exchange reserves close to $12 billion. With a substantially 
lower increase in imports, the trade deficit and also the 
current account deficit would narrow significantly compared to 
the previous years. The financing gap will, therefore, also be 
correspondingly smaller. 
  It has, however, a word of caution as well. Debt-serve 
payments are likely to increase in the next three years. 
Debt-servicing is expected to peak in 1996-97 and because of the 
large interest and principal repayments, a substantial financing 
gap may be expected to remain in the coming three years. 
  In the context of this challenge, the survey moots certain 
policy measures. It says rapid and sustained export growth 
remains the key to long-term viability of BoP and the reduction 
of foreign debt. The policy bias against exports provided by 
import licensing and high tariffs has, therefore, to be 
eliminated over time. 
  The country's agricultural and allied exports continue to be 
severely constrained by policy-imposed restrictions. Asserting 
that these exports posed no threat to the objective of food 
security, the survey calls for removal of these curbs which will 
provide farmers with fresh incentives to increase output. 
  On the other hand, a major share of bulk imports continues 
to 
be canalised and more than a third of the tariff lines are still 
covered by some form of import licensing. Quantitative 
restrictions on import of consumer goods provide very high 
levels of effective protection to these sectors. This results in 
misallocation of investible resources from sectors where the 
country may process a competitive advantage. Policy reforms in 
these areas, the survey says, "merit urgent and co-ordinated 
government action." Moreover, there is a need to augment 
infrastructural facilities for exports. 
  The survey notes that with the Indian economy increasingly 
integrated with the world economy, the management of the BoP 
will pose major challenges. Careful attention will need to be 
given to exchange rate policy, external debt strategy and 
foreign exchange reserve management. 
  Policy must ensure that exchange rate developments do not 
weaken the competitiveness of Indian exports. The large stock of 
external debt has to be carefully managed to minimise the 
potential for sudden pressures on liquidity of the kind that 
disrupted the economy in 1990-91. Foreign exchange reserves must 
be held at levels commensurate with growing trade and capital 
flows and the increasing diversity and flexibility of such 
flows. Anticipatory actions will have to be taken to guard 
against shocks such as a sudden rise in global petroleum prices 
or an agricultural drought. 
  On the performance in the external sector, the survey 
projects import growth to be limited to 4 percent during 1993-94 
despite large-scale liberalisation of import policy. The trade 
deficit in the first nine months of 1993-94 was only $732 
million which was less than one-fourth of the level in the 
corresponding period of 1992-93. The current account deficit in 
1993-94 is expected to be less than 0.5 percent of the GDP 
(little over $1 billion). 
  The year has also seen a sharp increase in inflow of foreign 
investment. The total quantum of foreign investment flows could 
be about $3 billion compared to $585 million during 1992-93 and 
$148 million in 1991-92. 
  Foreign exchange reserves had built up to $10.9 billion on 
February 4, 1994. It is expected that there will be a build-up 
of about $5.5 billion in reserves during 1993-94, taking these 
close to $12 billion. 
  "The year under review has, therefore, seen the country 
emerge decisively out of its BoP crisis of the past three 
years," the survey noted. 
  The survey makes some interesting observation on the foreign 
trade trends during 1993-94. Manufacturers, which had a share of 
74.6 percent in 1991-92 and 76.3 percent in 1992-93 in the 
country's exports, are loosing their predominance during the 
current year. Agricultural exports increased by 38 percent while 
manufactured exports grew by only 19 percent during the first 
half of 1993-94. The survey, however, views this as a "positive 
trend" which needs to be strengthened as it generates backward 
linkages within the domestic economy and stimulates growth. 
  Similarly, the survey offers an explanation for decline in 
imports which have baffled many. It says the fall in imports 
cannot be explained away by pointing towards the slow recovery 
in industrial output. Fertiliser imports have declined as a 
result of decontrol of prices of phosphatic and potassic 
fertilisers. Imports of other commodities, which are largely in 
the nature of intermediate inputs, may have declined on account 
of weak industrial recovery but perhaps more so because of 
exchange rate changes. At the new exchange rates, domestic 
substitutes, whose quality is improving, have become more 
economical. 
  For the first time the survey reports on the developments in 
the hawala foreign exchange market. It says the 
premium in the hawala market for the U.S. dollar had 
come down sharply by the end of 1992-93 to about 10 percent. It 
reached its historically lowest level of 6 percent in mid-June 
1993. This was a result of exchange rate policy and the 
liberalisation of bullion imports. The premium temporarily went 
up during August to October 1993 when it reached 13 percent. It 
has declined during the subsequent months.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 23--With the petroleum companies 
having achieved a significant improvement in performance, 
central public enterprises recorded a 44 percent increase in net 
profits during 1992-93. The scenario would have been far 
brighter, but for the fact that losses by sick public 
enterprises had mounted to nearly Rs. [Rupees] 4,000 crore. 
  This is disclosed in the Public Enterprises Survey for 
1992-93 which was presented in Parliament today. The Indian Oil 
Corporation (IOC) heads the list of profitable undertakings, 
with a net profit of Rs. 935 crores, while Rashtriya Ispat Nigam 
is the highest loss-making concern with a net loss of Rs. 568 
crores. 
  The net profit for the year had risen by Rs. 1,040 crores to 
reach Rs. 3,395 crores during the year. The petroleum sector, as 
usual, is responsible for the lion's share with Rs. 551 crores 
but non-oil sector companies also achieved a substantial 
increase in net profit estimated at Rs. 489 crore. 
  The impact of the loss-making enterprises on the overall 
performance of the public sector is indicated by the fact that 
the net profits of 131 enterprises is Rs. 7,346 crores while 104 
companies suffered Rs. 3,950.50 crores. 
  In an analysis of the performance of non-oil companies which 
are not sick, the Survey finds that these have shown net profits 
of Rs. 1,798 crores compared to Rs. 1,574 crores the previous 
year. The study had been carried out to exclude the effect of 
very high profits of the oil enterprises and the large losses of 
sick companies and evaluates performance of other units in a 
competitive environment. It concludes that sick enterprises are 
mainly responsible for low profitability of public enterprises 
as these account for net losses of Rs. 2,524 crores in the 
manufacturing and service sectors. 
  The Survey notes that the overall net return on investment, 
in terms of ratio of net profit to capital employed, had risen 
only marginally from 2 percent in 1991-92 to 2.43 percent in 
1992-93. The gross profit, when viewed as percentage of capital 
employed, also shows a marginal decline from 18.83 percent to 
18.02 percent. 
  According to the Survey, this has to be viewed in the 
background of the multi-dimensional objectives of public 
enterprises and the divergent constraints faced by them. In 
order to be fair to them, it is felt, it will be necessary to 
take into account the obligations of public enterprises which 
transcend the concepts of production and profits. The 
performance of public enterprises had to be evaluated keeping in 
view the contributions made in discharging socioeconomic 
obligations, development of backward regions, provision of 
public utility services and selling basic inputs or products at 
administered prices. 
  The Survey which had taken the performance of 245 
enterprises 
into account, notes that the investment in these companies had 
risen by Rs. 11,526 crores, an increase of 8.5 percent. 
Similarly, gross sales had recorded an improvement of Rs. 12,807 
crores, a 9.5 percent rise. Value added in production 
enterprises also rose by 8.24 percent, from Rs. 35,212 crores to 
Rs. 38,114 crores. 
  Other highlights: Other highlights of the Survey 
are, the 13.67 percent rise in gross internal resources. These 
have increased by Rs. 1,780.51 crores, to reach Rs. 14,723 
crores from Rs. 12,942 crores last year. Export earnings have 
also risen by Rs. 1,366 crores to touch Rs. 10,345 crores during 
the year. Contribution to the exchequer in the form of corporate 
tax, Excise duty, Customs and other duties and dividend 
increased by Rs. 2,136 crores from Rs. 19,951 crores the 
previous year. 
  The company with the highest investment during the year is 
the National Thermal Power Corporation with a total investment 
of Rs. 17,700 crores followed by Coal India Limited with Rs. 
10,508 crores. 
  In absolute terms, the gross profit of public enterprises 
during the year had risen by Rs. 2,303 crores, a 17 percent 
increase from Rs. 13,675 crores in 1991-92 to Rs. 15,978 crores. 
  The Survey notes that the ratio of net turnover to capital 
employed brings out the efficiency of utilisation of funds of 
any enterprises. This had fallen to 95.77 percent in 1992-93, 
compared to 104.78 percent the previous year. Group-wise 
analysis, however, indicates that there had been an improvement 
in the ratio in eight sectors, including tourist services, 
contracts and construction, textiles and consumer goods. Another 
13 sectors had shown a decline, including medium, and light 
engineering, petroleum and trading and marketing. 
  Providing an overall picture of profit and loss in various 
industry groups, the Survey notes that the steel sector losses 
had fallen by Rs. 430 crores. On the other hand, losses of the 
fertiliser sector had risen from Rs. 394 crores to Rs. 564 
crores while the textiles industry losses had increased from Rs. 
313 crores to Rs. 572 crores. Profits of the petroleum sector 
had risen by Rs. 551 crores, while other sectors which had 
registered some increase in profits are coal, financial 
services, and telecom. The manufacturing sector as a whole shows 
a rise in a profit of Rs. 530 crores against Rs. 510 crores for 
the services sector. 
  On memoranda of understanding (MOUs), it is stated that 98 
enterprises entered into such agreement with their 
administrative Ministries during the year. Of these, 34 were 
rated as `excellent,' and 35 as `very good'. 
  The Survey says that a major initiative to disinvest 
Government shareholding in public sector units was taken during 
the year in order to raise resources, encourage wider public 
participation and promote greater accountability. An amount of 
Rs. 1,912 crores was mobilised during the year by disinvesting 
around five percent equity holding of 16 public enterprises. In 
the previous year, the Government had disinvested eight percent 
of the shareholding in 30 enterprises at a total value of Rs. 
3,038 crore. 
  Another significant development during the year was the

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 24--The railway budget for 1994-95 
today proposed a six percent hike in upper class passenger fares 
and a marginal increase of up to Rs [Rupees] 20 in second class 
fares along with modifications in freight tariffs for long 
distance haulage to raise an additional revenue of Rs 997 crores 
to cover a budgetary gap of an equal amount, report Agencies. 
  An additional revenue of Rs 800 crores is expected to be 
mopped up from freight traffic and another Rs 197 crores from 
the travelling public. 
  The estimated Rs 197 crores includes Rs 45 crores from 
second 
class passengers. By hiking the fares of monthly season tickets, 
the railways expects Rs 17 crores. This amount was included in 
the anticipated additional revenue of Rs 45 crores from second 
class travellers. 
  Presenting the budget in Parliament, the railway minister, 
Mr 
C.K. Jaffar Shariff, left untouched the poorer sections, who 
travel up to 100 km in second class ordinary trains, while 
proposing a marginal increase between Re 1 and Rs 5 for 
distances beyond 100 km. 
  While second class mail and express fares for distances up 
to 
155 km are proposed to be marginally reduced, a modest increase 
from Re 1 to Rs 20 has been proposed in the fares for distances 
beyond. 
  An increase between Re 1 and Rs 40 has been effected for 
second class monthly season ticket fares in the suburban sector. 
  By a sleight of hand, the railway minister has modified the 
telescopic freight tariff by reducing the taper for long 
distance haulage and made changes in classification of items. 
  The items covered by upward revision in classification 
include coal, iron and steel, cement, HSD [high-speed diesel] 
oil, oil cake and molasses. 
  With a view to avoiding undue burden on the common man, Mr 
Shariff does not propose to change the classification for grains 
and pulses meant for the public distribution system. 
  Mr Shariff also proposed to continue the exemption from 
freight increases for 12 essential commodities, including salt, 
kerosene, livestock, LPG [liquified petroleum gas], edible oil 
and fodder. 
  The present rebate of six percent on freight allowed for 
cement and chemical manures loaded in open wagons is to be 
enhanced to ten percent. 
  In his bit to maximise revenue, Mr Shariff also proposed to 
reduce the minimum distance for charge in respect of freight 
traffic from 100 km to 75 km and reduce the distance blocks for 
charge beyond 2,400 km from the present 50 km to 25 km. 
  The minister announced the introduction of new trains, 
extension of the runs of a few existing trains and increasing 
the frequency of some. 
  In a politically significant decision, the budget has 
earmarked Rs 50 crores in the next year for the Jammu-Udhampur 
link while final location survey has been ordered for extending 
this rail link to Srinagar. 
  All the new proposals will come into force from April 1, 
1994. 
  Sleeper class fares will continue to be 25 percent higher 
than the second class fares as at present. 
  The six percent increase for upper class fares covers AC 
[airconditioned] first class, first class, AC sleeper and AC 
chair car. 
  Fares for the new AC three tier will be charged at 25 
percent 
higher than the fares of AC chair car as at present. 
  The fares for Rajdhani, including August Kranti Rajdhani and 
Shatabdi Express trains are also proposed to be suitably revised. 
  Among the highlights of the budget are introduction of 12 
new 
trains including the weekly Rajdhani Expresses linking Delhi and 
Guwahati and Bhubaneshwar. 
  In the suburban railway sector, the fares for second class 
monthly season ticket up to a distance of 90 km are to be 
increased by Re 1 to Rs 9, depending upon the distance. 
  For distances beyond 90 km the increase in the season ticket 
fares would range from Rs 11 to Rs 40. 
  Mr Shariff claimed that 90 percent of the monthly season 
ticket holders travel up to 90 km only and they have to pay 
extra a maximum amount of only Rs 9 per month. 
  There will be no change in the quarterly season tickets 
which 
will continue to be charged at 2.5 times the monthly season 
ticket fares, while first class season tickets will continue to 
be charged at four times the second class fares. 
  The fees now levied for computerised reservations are 
proposed to be made applicable for manual reservations also. The 
reservation charges are Rs 5 for second class seat, Rs 10 for 
sleeper class, Rs 15 for AC chair car, AC three tier, first 
class and AC sleeper and Rs 25 for AC first class. 
  Mr Shariff said that the railways' strategies for growth 
include gauge conversion and railway electrification of selected 
routes, strengthening tracks, more powerful locomotives, 
speeding up freight trains, terminals for goods and parcel 
traffic, lighter and more comfortable passenger traffic, lighter 
and more comfortable passenger coaches, improved customer 
service and development of real estate to supplement resources. 
  In the next financial year, the railways expect to carry 380 
million tonnes of freight traffic. 
  As regards passenger traffic, a growth rate of two percent 
over the traffic likely to be carried this year is anticipated. 
  Concerned over accidents at unmanned level crossings, the 
minister has provided Rs 25 crores in the budget for maning 
about 500 level crossings.

<F P=106> [Article by Ja'far Ra'ed: "Consolidation of the State's </F>
Authority in Iran"] 
  [Text] With the beginning of the 16th year of the Iranian 
revolution, the leader of the revolution, Ayatollah 'Ali 
Khamene'i, has made a number of important decisions. The 
decisions have demonstrated, in a clear and unambiguous fashion, 
the existence of a strong central authority in Iran today, which 
can take hold of Iran's inhabitants with a strong and 
unflinching hand and guide them in the direction this central 
authority desires. These decisions have also proved that what 
used to be called a duality of authority has now become a thing 
of the past. At the same time, they have indicated that the 
revolution's centers of power, which possessed clout and 
influence, have in fact been cut down to size. 
  The first step taken by Ayatollah Khamene'i in the direction 
of strengthening the authority of the state was to give free 
rein to the minister of interior--a person in whom he has 
confidence--to take charge of matters and strike down those who 
would do damage to the nation's security and stability. This was 
done by entrusting him with the power and authority of 
commander-in-chief of the armed forces--authority which was 
previously entrusted to learned clergymen--and command of the 
police and security forces, the gendarmerie, and the 
mobilization forces--for a period of three years. There was a 
reason for making this period of time three years. The second 
and last term of rule by Hojjat ol-Eslam Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani is a period of time totaling four years, and 
more than six months of this term have already gone by. In three 
years' time the end of this term will be near, and the duties 
undertaken by his minister of interior will then be almost 
concluded. 
  The name of this minister of interior, who currently has 
such 
broad authority, is 'Ali Mohammed Besharati-Jahromi. "Jahrom" is 
a city in southeastern Iran and is famous for the quality of its 
date crop. It is in the region called "Fars," and its capital 
city is Shiraz, the city of the two poets Sa'di and Hafez. Also, 
the moon as seen from Shiraz was celebrated by the Iraqi poet 
al-Bayati in his famous poem "The Moon of Shiraz," and other 
Arab poets as well have celebrated the beauty of this city. 
  Before 'Ali Mohammed Besharati-Jahromi took over the 
Ministry 
of Interior, and before the nation's spiritual leader entrusted 
him with the powers of commander-in-chief of the forces 
responsible for internal security, he undertook two initiatives 
that left no doubt as to his decisiveness and determination to 
curtail the intervention of the centers of power in matters that 
were to be within his area of responsibility. The first of these 
initiatives was to prevent the so-called "Moslem students 
marching along the path of the Imam" from demonstrating in front 
of the [former] U.S. Embassy on the anniversary of its 
occupation. This is the same group that had occupied the U.S. 
Embassy in Tehran in 1980. [date as published] Every year, on 
this anniversary, the group had been accustomed to demonstrating 
across from the [former] U.S. Embassy and burning the U.S. flag, 
and hearing speeches from their leaders such as Mohtashemi and 
Kho'iniha. The demonstration took place [this time] on the 
anniversary, across from the [former] U.S. Embassy in Tehran, 
but under the supervision of the government organizations, who 
did not permit the burning of the U.S. flag, since this was 
considered to be an insult to the people of the United States 
and their nation and regime. 
  The second initiative was to prevent Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali 
Akbar Mohtashemi--the former minister of interior, who had also 
been, before that, the Islamic Republic's ambassador to Damascus 
and was one of the founders of Hizballah in Lebanon--from giving 
a speech to the public in the city of Sari, in northern Iran. 
These two initiatives, which were the first signs of what 
Besharati would do, were like a clear and unmistakable 
announcement of the fact that this man was serious and did not 
joke around. 
  It is interesting to note, in the case of Besharati, that he 
is the first minister of interior in the days of the Iranian 
Islamic Republic who does not wear a turban and is not one of 
the clergy. All of those who had preceded him in this high-level 
position since the rise of the new regime in Iran had borne the 
title of "Ayatollah" or "Hojjat ol-Eslam," such as Ayatollah 
Mahdawi Kani, Hojjat ol-Eslam Hashemi-Rafsanjani, Hojjat 
ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar 
Mohtashemi, and the last one, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Abdollah Nuri. If 
it is true what people say concerning the possibility that this 
strong and decisive man will be nominated and elected president 
of the republic and thus succeed Hojjat ol-Eslam 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, then this will be another weak spot in the 
make-up of the Iranian Islamic Republic, which will be broken. 
Perhaps it would be more appropriate, in the Velayat-e Faqih 
regime, not to have a clerical leader be chief of the executive 
power of government in order that he not issue individual 
interpretations of religious law. 
  'Ali Mohammed Besharati-Jahromi was the first deputy to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati before the 
Ministry of Interior was entrusted to him. He was also one of 
the candidates to succeed his minister in the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, but Dr. Velayati was retained in his ministry 
and the portfolio of the Ministry of Interior was entrusted to 
him. Besharati was successful in his former position as first 
deputy minister of foreign affairs. Before leaving this 
ministry, he made a trip to North Africa, during which he 
visited Tunisia and Morocco. One of the positive results of this 
trip was the fact that normal relations were once again 
established between Iran and both Tunisia and Morocco. Besharati 
maintained his interest in foreign affairs issues even after he 
was transferred to the Ministry of Interior. As evidence of this 
interest on his part we have the statements he made, while 
visiting Qatar a few weeks ago, concerning the necessity of 
developing Iranian-Arab relations and his expectation that 
good-neighborly relations and cooperation would develop between 
Iran and Saudi Arabia. 
  Besharati's appointment to the Ministry of Interior during 
the second week of August 1993 was welcomed by various circles 
of people in Iran. They include extremist press, which made 
reference to his past services and praised his prominent role in 
the Revolution Guard and its intelligence bureau which foiled 
many plots hatched against the regime of the Islamic Republic 
during a critical period of its history. 
  One fact that Arab readers should know is that Besharati, 
when he was first deputy minister of foreign affairs, forwarded 
a report three days before Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, and in 
this report he gave a very accurate assessment of the 
consequences expected as a result of the occupation of Kuwait by 
Iraq, and his report also listed all the benefits Iran would 
reap by adhering to a policy of neutrality in this dispute. This 
accurate report was the reason for Ayatollah Khamene'i's sending 
him a message of praise and appreciation in March of 1991, in 
which he provided his assessment of Besharati's capability and 
his political astuteness. It was an official message that was 
signed by Khamene'i himself, and it constituted an exceptional 
gesture on his part. Besharati is considered to be one of a 
group of pioneers in the Iranian Islamic Republic. During the 
previous regime he was in jail and spent about four years under 
arrest, and during that time he was the object of respect on the 
part of his jailers because of his reasonable and responsible 
behavior. He is known for his strong enmity toward leftist and 
extremist organizations and those who belong to them. At the 
present time he enjoys the favor of Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq-Nuri, speaker of the Majles and head of the parliamentary 
majority known as the "Resalat bloc." ("Resalat" means 
"mission.") The members of the Resalat bloc consist of about 170 
deputies or members of the Majles. This bloc is a conservative 
one which fosters Islamic traditions, adopts the policy of free 
trade, and represents the Iranian bourgeoisie. 
  We have dealt, at great length, with the Iranian minister of 
interior, 'Ali Mohammed Besharati-Jahromi, because it is 
expected that he will rise quickly and take on major 
responsibilities. Besharati was born in the town of Jahrom in 
1944 and graduated from both elementary and secondary school 
there. He received his higher education in Tehran where he 
specialized in education, and then he entered government service 
in Qom. He utilized this opportunity to attend courses in 
Islamic sciences, and later on he studied in the College of Law 
in Tehran. Then he joined the revolutionary movement, and 
because of that, he went to jail. When the revolution took 
place, he became responsible for guarding Khomeini during the 
Imam's return to Iran. Then he was appointed head of the 
intelligence bureau of the [Revolution] Guard in the Command 
Council of the Revolution Guard. He became a member of the 
Majles as a result of the first elections held after the 
revolution, representing the people of Jahrom. He was given 
great responsibilities in the parliament, including membership 
in the fact-finding commission that investigated abuse and 
torture of prisoners in jails. He acquired a good reputation as 
a result of this work since he stood up for prisoners who 
suffered abuse and argued in their defense with the overseers of 
the prison system. 
  In general, Besharati, during the various stages of his 
political activity, became known as an opponent of reckless and 
extremist behavior in the name of the revolution, and he has 
written some works, including one called "Humaneness in Islam." 
  In connection with the beginning of the 16th year since the 
establishment of the regime of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah 
Khamene'i, the nation's spiritual leader, in addition to 
supporting Besharati as minister of interior, embarked upon the 
taking of other measures that indicated that he was beginning to 
curtail the role of some of the centers of power. These measures 
included the dismissal of the brother of President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, Mohammad Hashemi, who had been the overseer 
of Iran's radio and television for 13 years and who was 
transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and the 
appointment of the minister of Islamic guidance, 'Ali Larijani, 
as the new overseer of Iran's radio and television. Ayatollah 
Khamene'i sent a long letter to Larijani in which he explained 
the policy guidelines to be adhered to by Iran's radio and 
television. These recommendations included the necessity of 
being concerned about the Persian language used over radio and 
television and raising its usage to a higher level. Groups 
opposed to President Hashemi-Rafsanjani welcomed this new 
appointment and had high praise for Larijani's personality, 
capabilities, revolutionary past, and great knowledge of 
literature, art, and politics. He is expected to bring about 
basic changes in these important media, of which he will be in 
charge. 
  Ayatollah Khamene'i then appointed Mostafa Mirsalim as 
minister of Islamic guidance. This man is known for his maturity 
and impartiality, and occupied a number of sensitive posts 
during the days when Khamene'i was president of the Islamic 
Republic, including the post of director of public security. 
  These basic changes have been accompanied by other important 
steps taken by Ayatollah Khamene'i. They have included the 
removal of Engineer Mar'ashi (brother-in-law of President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani) from his post as governor of the province of 
Kerman in southeastern Iran, the province which contains the 
town of Rafsanjan. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani then hastened to 
appoint Mar'ashi to the post of chief of the Office of the 
Presidency of the Republic. 
  Other fairly important changes in other institutions have 
also taken place, including the dissolution of the agency that 
was responsible for setting policy for Iran's radio and 
television programs. This agency had existed ever since the 
beginning of the new regime. 
  After undertaking all these measures, the leader of the 
revolution, Ayatollah Khamene'i, was the prayer leader for the 
faithful during the first Friday prayer this year after the 
sighting of the crescent in Iran during the blessed month of 
Ramadan. This initiative, that is, Ayatollah Khamene'i's serving 
as prayer leader for all the faithful during the Friday prayer, 
is something that rarely happens. One of the most important 
things that the spiritual leader of the Islamic Republic 
announced to the faithful during last Friday's prayer, the date 
of which corresponded to 18 February this year, was the fact 
that he will turn a blind eye to opponents of the government in 
Iran who express their opposition in newspapers published inside 
Iran and who make statements to foreign radio stations abroad. 
It appears that, with this statement, he wanted to demonstrate 
the magnanimity of the government agencies toward those who are 
in the opposition. 
  Before we conclude this article, we should make it clear 
that 
the measures taken in recent weeks by the spiritual leader of 
the nation cannot really be considered to be a challenge to the 
authority of President Hashemi-Rafsanjani or an effort to 
degrade his position. One thing that attracts our attention is 
the fact that Ayatollah Khamene'i never misses an opportunity to 
praise the personality and laudable qualities of the republic's 
president. In fact, he praises him so highly that some people 
feel that there is a large measure of exaggeration in what he 
says. Whoever closely follows events in Iran, especially the 
debates that take place in the Majles, knows that these measures 
have been taken in accordance with the opinions of the majority 
of the members of the parliament. One of these measures that was 
widely acclaimed was the dismissal of Mohammed Hashemi, the 
overseer of Iran's radio and television, concerning whom 
parliament selected a committee to investigate what was going on 
in the organization that he was the head of, and the results of 
the investigation were not at all in his favor. Merciless 
attacks occurred between Mohammed Hashemi and the members of the 
parliament, and perhaps President Hashemi-Rafsanjani was 
embarrassed about his brother and unable to take any measures 
against him, so Ayatollah Khamene'i chose to save him from this 
anguish. 
  It could be said that the current session of parliament 
represents the traditional merchant class, and it is known that 
this class of people has ties to devoutly religious Shiite 
circles and clergymen other than the extremist revolutionary 
types, as previously mentioned. Most of the members of 
parliament who are members of this economic class are united 
under the banner of the "Resalat" bloc and the current speaker 
of parliament, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, who is its 
spokesman. Perhaps we can conclude from all of this that Iran's 
general policy is moving in the direction of being a religious 
national bourgeois policy.

<F P=106> [Article by Mouloud Benmohamed: "The Lambese Prison: The </F>
Mystery of a Breakout" -- first paragraph is EL MOUDJAHID 
introduction; final two paragraphs are from APS] 
  [Text] For one hour and 15 minutes, armed groups 
beleaguered the village of Tazoult and the Lambese prison so as 
to allow a great number of prisoners to escape and to steal 
firearms. This happened last Thursday, at the time of the call 
to prayer. Everything had been prepared in great detail. A 
commission of inquiry made up of members from the ministries of 
justice, the interior, and defense, has been on site since 
yesterday. 
  How could the prisoners at Lambese-Tazoult escape? 
  The question has been plaguing the minds of all Algerians 
who 
never believed such an escape could happen in the most feared 
prison in Algeria. Its reputation has just fallen like a house 
of cards. Anything is possible when a or some prison guards 
(their number makes no difference; all it takes is a single 
accomplice for internal security measures to be useless) join 
with the attackers. 
  When you have gotten to know this prison in connection with 
a 
report on prison conditions, when you have spoken at length with 
prisoners in their cells, when you have met death row inmates 
who have been waiting to be pardoned or executed for years in 
this grim corridor of death, when you have moved about in these 
detention areas with their walls as thick as a 400-year-old oak 
tree, when you have observed that it takes a fairly long time to 
walk the distance separating the cells from the main gate, when 
you have counted more than 15 reinforced metal gates between the 
first cell and the first area where you regain your freedom, you 
can only be puzzled, flabbergasted, you can only be stupefied 
and speechless when you learn that an escape of..."900" 
prisoners took place in the harshest prison in Algeria. 
  This figure, which is neither confirmed nor denied, and the 
news could make a mute talk. You're aghast. You don't believe 
your ears and your eyes. 
  In that place, they don't lock up just any prisoner, just 
any 
small-time criminal or pickpocket. In that place they keep only 
the most hard core, the most difficult, the most recalcitrant, 
the most undisciplined, the ones who have lost everything 
(sentenced to die, to a life sentence, to long terms) but one 
tiny hope of regaining their freedom by whatever means possible. 
<H5>  At the Breaking of the Fast </H5>
  The Lambese-Tazoult prison, located 12 km from Batna, below 
the village of Tazoult, is not a simple annex or a preventive 
agency or a primary reeducation institution. It is a 
readaptation prison just as are those at El Asnem or Berrouaghia. 
  In accordance with Article 26 of Order 72-2 dated 10 
February 
1972 codifying the prison and reeducation system, this prison is 
charged with "receiving prisoners serving prison sentences of or 
greater than one year, prisoners sentenced to solitary 
confinement with hard labor, and habitual lawbreakers, 
regardless of the length of their term." 
  You don't leave this prison (nor do you enter it) the way 
you 
leave your own home. That is to say, with complete freedom, 
without informing someone beforehand. 
  From the individual or common cell, from the detention room 
to the main entrance gate, a minimum of 15 keys is required. 
Every time you enter or leave one place to go to another, from 
one corridor to another, you have to open and reclose a heavy 
metal gate or a metal grill behind you. This action--a 
rite--must be repeated each time by the director, the guard, or 
the head of detention until he is back on the street. 
  To reach the street, you cross several long corridors, 
courtyards, very extensive spaces, and the detention area; 
everywhere you walk along very high walls and barred windows. 
The smallest door, even the one to the broom closet, is 
triple-locked. There is a stout lock plus two dead bolts that 
are kept shut with a padlock. 
  Guards everywhere. Reeducation agents. Of every age but 
especially young men. Those walking the enclosure walls are 
armed, and so are the others, though less heavily, but their 
most important weapon is the bunch of keys by which the gates 
open and close, get pushed and pulled, get unlocked and locked 
as they groan, as they slide, and as they almost creak. Nothing 
is done without a noise. Nothing is done that does not attract 
attention. Everything is known or at least should be known when 
the guards are doing their duty, are on the lookout, when the 
guards have their eyes open, their ears to the ground, and their 
minds alert. Most, if not the majority, of these reeducation 
agents, called guards, live or reside in the village of Tazoult, 
which overlooks the prison. This is not a detail, it is 
extremely important to understand what happened, what took place 
last Thursday. 
  The first information received makes it possible to state 
that this was not a mere escape just put together by some 
prisoners or planned with a little outside support. No. This was 
very much a premeditated, prepared operation; a "strike" that 
was conceived and refined in every way; it was a plan that was 
thought through in its execution, calculated as to its phases, 
and drawn up in its organization. It was an operation, a 
"strike," a plan that left nothing to the imponderable, to the 
unexpected, to chance. It was planned. Everything was planned 
with respect to the sites, the prisoners, and the number of 
policemen and gendarmes in the area! 
  Even the nails were planned. 
  Before providing some details, still unofficial, a word 
about 
the director of the prison who is the top man responsible for 
security in the prison. 
  First, he is a native of Tazoult but he lives in the prison. 
In a company house, obviously. He is known to most of the 
residents of the area. Next, he is a man who enjoys a good 
reputation in the prison community, where he has been an 
employee for 22 years. He is too young to have been sentenced to 
death or sent to prison during the colonial period like most of 
the heads of prisons. Just the same, he is well acquainted with 
the premises and his "inmates." 
<H5>  One Prisoner With Four BAs! </H5>
  Who are the prisoners at Lambese-Tazoult? 
  There are minors in a special ward. They are kept quite 
apart 
from the areas where those who are more than 18 years old are 
kept. 
  There are the common criminals. Most are criminals (the 
others have been sentenced for having committed punishable 
crimes). One murdered a member of his family over a will; one 
thought it useful to kill a wife he thought had bad habits and, 
10 years after the crime, is sorry about it; there is one who 
killed his neighbor and yet another who took part in gang 
rapes.... Among them some try to improve themselves. For 
example, there is one student. Here a parenthesis: four former 
death row prisoners sat for their BA exams, and they passed! One 
of them took up the challenge of doing his BA four times: in 
literature, science, mathematics, and sciences cum laude. "I 
wanted to prove I could do it. I promised myself I would get the 
BA cum laude. I did," he told us. Since then, these former death 
row inmates have seen their sentences commuted and been 
pardoned. They are studying tax law! Let's close this 
parenthesis. 
  Last there are those who were sentenced by the special 
courts 
under the law on terrorism. There is everyone from the death row 
inmate to the prisoner sentenced to three years in solitary 
confinement and including those serving life sentences, 20-year 
sentences, 15-year sentences, etc. Most of them are young. 
  The eldest is 77. He is in prison for the rest of his life 
for the voluntary homicide of a cousin who had cut him out of 
his will. 
  After all of that, there are some questions: 
  How could such a large number of prisoners escape? 
  Did they have accomplices? If they did, at what level? What 
preventive security measures were taken? 
  What security conditions existed before the breakout? 
Internal but also external security, i.e., around and in the 
immediate environs of the prison. 
  How did the guards in charge of the prison's internal 
security react? 
  Did they have adequate arms and munitions? 
  Were the prisoners forewarned? Had they prepared themselves 
for the escape? 
  There are a thousand and one questions to which the 
commission of inquiry that has been set up--and has been at the 
scene of the scape since yesterday afternoon--will try to find 
answers so as to assign responsibility. But, as of now, we can 
report these words by the director of the prison who told us 
that "no one could have done anything whatsoever about it." 
  By that it should be understood that it was unavoidable, 
given the circumstances and the methods. 
  How was this possible? 
  What exactly had taken place? 
  How could the escape have happened? 
  For the moment there is very little official information. 
Except bits and pieces gathered from trustworthy sources. 
<H5>  The "Strike" Was Prepared </H5>
  Several hours before the escape, residents of Tazoult 
noticed 
a certain amount of frenetic activity, a lot of strangers in the 
village. Most were young people. 
  "It's residents of Batna doing their errands before the 
breakfast hour," some thought. 
  "It's the feast of the Aid. Things are normal. They think 
it's less expensive to buy clothing for their children from the 
stores in Tazoult. How naive," others said. 
  No one suspected that trucks covered with tarpaulins 
carrying 
armed men were waiting for the call to prayer to begin the 
operation. Some among this latter group would wait for the end 
of the call to prayer and the practicing's return home--almost 
all of them prison management employees--to move about in 
Tazoult. There were several dozen armed men who blocked all the 
roads leading out of the surrounded village who took possession 
of the streets and alleys. In this way prison guards were 
prevented from leaving their homes to help defend the besieged 
prison. Some of these men waited for the gendarmerie brigade and 
the Tazoult district police. Given their small numbers, security 
agents were impotent. It was impossible for them to contain the 
attack. Even less possible to repulse it. There was a greater 
number of attackers. A very great number. There were several 
armed groups who came from different areas. On trucks and on 
light vehicles. Judging from appearances, the "strike" had been 
in preparation for several weeks. The possibility cannot be 
excluded that the terrorist acts and attacks in the Algiers and 
Oran areas were supposed to create a diversion. 
  Several moments before armed groups beleaguered Tazoult and 
attacked the two security posts--at the very moment of the call 
to prayer (the call to prayer was supposed to have acted as a 
signal)--one of the prison guards who was on duty at the main 
gate--an accomplice--ordered his colleague to hand him his keys 
to open the gate. The latter refused. There was an outburst of 
voices. The director who was at prayers was notified. He thought 
there was an altercation between colleagues and he spoke to two 
of them from his window. At that moment the accomplice fired a 
round of shots and the guard dropped dead. The weapon was aimed 
at the window and there were one, then two rounds of shots. The 
director went looking for his gun to shoot back; the prison 
guard who was the accomplice took advantage to open the main 
gate. Three trucks covered with tarpaulins entered the prison at 
the same time as a Golf and two white vehicles. The attackers 
jumped off and shot. Prison staff fired back. There were rounds 
of fire, exchanges of bullets, then the greater number of 
attackers dispersed in three groups. 
  The first group went to the administrative block and the 
isolation cells. The second destroyed the alarm signal and set 
about looking for the weapons room in the hope of stealing some 
Kalashnikovs and light modern arms from it. A few moments later, 
using guns, the locks on the weapons storage room were "blown 
off." There were in fact sophisticated weapons, or they were the 
latest model, for the attackers took possession of automatic 
Belgian pistols, Chicoms, Mat-49's dating from the war of 
independence, and munitions. 
  They stole 133 weapons, all of which would be recovered in 
the first hours of the search operation. Ditto for the 
munitions. During this time, the third group of attackers fanned 
out through the detention areas. The locks and dead bolts of the 
cells and cell blocks were blown away with gunfire. The first to 
escape were the death row inmates whose death row cells are off 
the common rooms. These were prisoners sentenced to die by the 
three special courts and common criminals. Next the prisoners 
serving life sentences and long terms escaped. Some common 
criminals did as well. Some prisoners--common criminals and 
special courts [prisoners]--refused to follow the attackers. 
Others--a large number that has not been officially 
announced--did not hesitate. Freedom was so close. But it would 
not last long for 79 of them who would be arrested whereas 
others would be gunned down during the search, which grew more 
intense hour by hour. The region was cut off. Even local 
residents took part. 
  After about one hour and 15 minutes, the three groups got 
back together and withdrew leaving dead and wounded behind them. 
As they fled, for the second time they strewed nails on the 
pavement, which prevented police from reaching the prison. The 
tires on their vehicles blow out. 
  This would be the second time, since security forces had 
already been blocked when they arrived by blocks of stone, 
nails, and even a bulldozer placed on the main access road 
leading to the prison. The road was blocked! 
  The trucks made escape in every direction easier. 
Particularly towards the nearby mountains. With them were seven 
prison guards. 
  Were they accomplices? The inquiry will show that. They were 
shields, some think. 
  The search was started a few moments later. A security team 
was set up. The security services combined their forces. The 
search is carried out even at night. 
  Thirty-nine people among the escapees and the attackers are 
arrested several hours later, and (towards 1600) the number 
rises to 79 arrested and 24 others shot. Those searches continue 
as we go to press. 
  In the wake of escapes from the reeducation centers at Sidi 
Ghiles (Tipaza), Blida, and the Serkadji van (which was headed 
towards Tazoult), last Thursday's [escape] urgently poses the 
question of security in prisons. If we can say that inside the 
prison security was not ensured as the most ordinary of citizens 
might believe, i.e., with a large number of security guards 
having modern weapons and armed to the teeth, we might note that 
no team was set up on the outside. 
  That is to say, around the prison. Last January, a few 
hundred meters away from the Lambese prison, the bodies of three 
murder victims were discovered: the father, father-in-law, and 
cousin of one staff member who had been receiving threats. An 
external security force was more than indispensable. It was 
vital. Both for the prison and for the reputation of the forces 
of law and order which seems to be picking up again as they 
pursue the attackers and escapees. 
  What happened last April at the Berroughia prison led the 
concerned authorities to set up reinforced surveillance posts 
and implement an appropriate security team all around these 
prisons, whose running brings honor or dishonor to the state's 
authority. 
<H5>  Seventy-Nine Escapees Arrested, 24 Shot </H5>
  Seventy-nine individuals who escaped from the Tazoult prison 
have been arrested and 24 others shot by police who recovered a 
large number of weapons, a communique issued by security forces 
yesterday announced. 
  The search and surround operations are still being pursued, 
it went on to say.

<F P=106> [Article by Mouloud Benmohamed: "The Lambese Prison: The </F>
Scenario for the Breakout"] 
  [Text] About fifty prisoners freed! A day of reprieve. 
Lambese experiences an extraordinary morning. Or rather, it 
would be an extraordinary day. 
  An extraordinary morning for those who will be with their 
loved ones on the day of Aid El-Fitr. They are pleased even if 
they are not happy. 
  An extraordinary day for the others. For the prison guards. 
For the director of the Lambese prison. For the people of the 
"village" of Tazoult. For everyone. Except the dead: one guard 
dead, three wounded, another about whom there is no word. 
Regarding the attackers, no one can come up with a figure for 
dead and wounded. 
  Extraordinary too because the main gate of the most famous 
and feared prison in Algeria will once again close behind behind 
the approximately 50 pardoned prisoners only to be reopened with 
fire and blood a few hours later thanks to the help from 
accomplices. 
<H5>  Five Accomplices? </H5>
  Presumably the escape plan was based--at a minimum--on five 
prison guard accomplices. 
  Who are they? 
  They were guards who had recently been transferred. 
  Three came from Barika. Two of them were reported to be 
closely linked to the main organizer of the breakout from the 
Barika prison. They were reported to have asked to be 
transferred before it happened. 
  At the time of the attack, according to testimony given and 
statements made, the five accomplices were situated as follows. 
  The first--who was not on duty at the time of the events and 
was supposed to be in the dining hall to break the fast--went to 
main gate No. 1 to kill his colleague in order to take the keys 
away from him and open the gate. 
  Two others--on duty--were several meters above, i.e., at 
main 
gate No. 2, which provides access to the detention areas. One 
was beside this gate, the other on the enclosure wall was 
talking and perhaps waiting for the signal. 
  Last, two others were on duty in the corridor leading 
directly to the cells of prisoners sentenced to die, the cell 
blocks, and the common rooms. 
  The possibility cannot be excluded that there were even more 
accomplices because certain guards--who were on leave or on 
duty--have not returned to their posts. 
  A sixth--who was at the observation post to the right of the 
main gate-- was kidnapped or taken hostage. He put up courageous 
resistance until he had no more ammunition. 
  What was the attackers' main objective? 
  It would seem that the objective was--mainly--freeing the 
death row inmates who were transported by truck and vehicle. 
Next the other prisoners who had been sentenced by the special 
courts and those common criminals were sent in the direction of 
the moutains--a road different from the one taken by the death 
row inmates. Some of the escapees did not even see these 
vehicles. That is to say that special treatment had been 
anticipated for the death row inmates. 
  Tracer bullets were fired at the time of the attack and at 
the end of the breakout to allow the armed groups that had taken 
over Tazoult's streets to regroup. There were also tracer 
bullets, several local residents emphasized, at the time the 
police arrived and at whom one group of attackers fired several 
kilometers away from the prison. 
  Let us remind our readers that security forces were 
prevented 
from intervening by vehicles (with their tires blown out) placed 
in two different locations located on two arteries leading to 
the prison. These were private passenger cars, one bulldozer, 
and triangular nails. 
  One reeducation guard stated: "One member of my family was 
accompanying me to the prison where I was supposed to go on 
duty. I was dressed in civilian clothes. As we were driving 
there, we were stopped by a false roadblock. Some armed men made 
us get out. They put the car in the middle of the road after 
blowing out its tires. I do not know if I would be alive if they 
had asked to see my identification papers. They sent us away... 
I was supposed to go to work. I took a path through the fields. 
As I was walking, I saw about 50 armed men talking... This was 
before the call to prayer. They were at the valley. They didn't 
say anything to me... Yes, the vehicle was recovered by the 
member of my family." 
  On the side of Tazoult that local residents reached in 
vehicles, it was the same story except that the vehicles were 
used to transport the prison escapees in the direction of the 
edge of the forest. Drivers did not hand them over willingly. 
"There was a gun to my head," one of them said. Some are 
reported to have found a thank-you note at the end of the 
operation for "assistance rendered" to the attackers! 
  How was the most spectacular attack and breakout in our 
country organized? Was there passivity? Negligence? The 
commission of inquiry will certainly reveal this. But "when you 
smell a rat," as the popular saying goes, nothing is impossible. 
  How did the prison guards react? Let us say only that the 
law 
prohibits them from taking action outside the prison. 
  Let us also say that inside the prison, they are really and 
truly...unarmed. Some time ago certain foreign voices thought 
that Algerian prisons were places of torture and extortion. And 
to think that the guards are not even armed! 
  What is more: the guards who have to ensure security on the 
enclosure wall and warn of any revolt had...10 bullets each. Was 
this negligence? Sloppiness? Complicity? Not at all. "A quantity 
of munitions only to maintain order," we were told. "Events" 
that have taken place in the prisons of other countries have 
left hundreds of fatalities. Even though they are not attacks! 
At Lambese, there were no reports of wounded or dead among the 
prisoners. There is no end of questions. It is hard to answer. 
Except if you opt for suppositions. Still, a trustworthy source 
from outside the prison who asked to remain anonymous stated the 
following, among other things: "Information circulated that the 
strike would happen a year ago. Fortunately the prison 
administration changed certain members of the staff who were 
suspect. District police and the gendarmerie brigade were looked 
at. The prison, too. We learned that the movement began in the 
cells and ended outside, contrary to what has been said, namely 
that the gate was opened. That is not true. It might be that 
there was a signal from the prison, you can see the 
mountains.... There are signs...some very serious negligence. 
There was passivity involved, not to mention complicity..." 
  What was happening outside before, during, and after the 
breakout? 
  Armed men had encircled Tazoult, which was completely under 
their control. One prison guard reported as follows: 
  "These were strangers. With guns in their hands, they 
ordered 
us not to move. People everywhere were taken by surprise. They 
told us: `Stop,' 'Hands up,' `What's your profession?,' `On the 
ground,' `Crouch,' `Lie down flat, stomach down.' We stayed that 
way about two hours. None of us could say a single word. `We're 
brothers, Mujahadeen,' `Pray for us' they said to old women who 
were going to the mosque. People didn't understand a thing. It 
was a surprise. There were rounds of shots a bit further away. 
Everywhere there was something odd. We hadn't understood 
anything about what they wanted." 
  After a moment the guard went on as follows: "It was 
terrible. I cannot sleep any more... If one of them had searched 
me, he would have found my professional card, then shot. No one 
could say a word. We were crouched down, we had our hands up or 
we were lying on the ground... Ever since we have not eaten, we 
cannot sleep any more, we are anxious. The colonial enemy did 
not do this." 
  During this time, "most of the troop" was in the vicinity of 
the prison. At exactly the same time the prison guards broke 
their fast.

<F P=106> [Interviews with four recaptured prisoners by Mouloud </F>
Benmohamed; place and date not given: "The Lambese Prison: Five 
[as published] Escapees Speak"--first paragraph is EL MOUDJAHID 
introduction] 
  [Text] "The attackers were wearing prison guard uniforms." 
"Some were wearing military uniforms." "There were vehicles in 
which the death row inmates were driven away." "No. There 
weren't any vehicles." Even if they seem contradictory, these 
reports by escapees--who were either arrested or taken into 
custody--tell us one thing at least. Or rather they confirm 
something. The breakout was carefully organized down to the 
tiniest detail. We spoke with five of the recaptured prisoners. 
[sentence as published] Their statements are more than eloquent. 
<H5>  M.M. (Serving a Life Sentence): "Get Out or Die" </H5>
  [Benmohamed] How did you escape? 
  [M.M.] I have been in jail for three years. I was sentenced 
to life in prison. I was alone in my cell, I had just broken the 
fast and heard shouts of "Allahu Akbar." For me, that was the 
usual thing, so I didn't try to find out anything else. Suddenly 
there were shouts. Some people were breaking the locks on the 
cells. One of them opened the door to my cell with some keys and 
he spoke to me saying: "Get out!" He had a Kalashnikov rifle and 
I was standing opposite him, next to the bed. I asked him: 
"Where?" He answered: "The mountains." "Why?" I asked. He then 
loaded his weapon and told me: "Either you get out or I shoot 
you. You have a choice. It's up to you to decide but do it soon 
or I'll decide for you." What should I do? I got out. Once I was 
at the main entrance gate, another armed man pointed out the 
road I should take and repeated "go up to the mountains." There 
were a lot of us. I was among the last ones. 
  [Benmohamed] Did you notice any vehicles in front of the 
prison's entrance gate? 
  [M.M.] No, no vehicle. 
  [Benmohamed] Then what happened? 
  [M.M.] A few minutes later, maybe a half hour, we stopped 
running to rest. 
  [Benmohamed] How many of you were there? 
  [M.M.] Between 50 and 60 prisoners. We were in the middle of 
the forest. One of the armed men asked us to split into two 
groups. In one there were those who had been sentenced by the 
special courts and in the other the common criminals. Then he 
spoke to the common criminals saying: "As of now, we don't know 
you; may Allah help you." He was the oldest one, 35 or 36 years 
old. He had a beard. He was wearing a prison guard uniform. He 
set off together with the men who were accompanying him and the 
special court prisoners. As for us, we went in our direction. We 
walked day and night in the mountains. There were 10 of us. We 
consulted one another. On the second day, the eve of the Aid, I 
couldn't fast. We had nothing to eat. On Sunday I suggested to 
my companions that we become prisoners. We were eating grass. 
They didn't agree with me because they were afraid. We were in 
the Ain Touta mountains. As of that moment, my companions began 
to distrust me. In the evening, I pretended to go off to tend to 
my bodily functions in the forest and left them. I walked for a 
long time at night. I was cold and hungry. I made a wood fire to 
warm up. I was very tired. On Tuesday, at dawn, I saw a military 
roadblock. I came down from the mountains and went straight 
towards the soldiers. I raised my arms as a sign that I meant no 
harm. I became a prisoner. That morning I was introduced to the 
prosecutor. I have just been sent to the Lambese prison. Between 
yesterday, when I was an escapee, and today, when I'm a 
prisoner, it's the difference between life and death. These 
aren't human beings. 
  [Benmohamed] Why? 
  [M.M.] They get us out of prison, they send us to the 
mountains, then they leave us in the middle of nowhere. Nothing 
to eat, no notion of the road, no money...No. 
  I was forced to escape. Either escape or die. Anyone else in 
my shoes would have done the same thing. That's what I told the 
prosecutor. I wasn't the only escapee in his office. There are 
others who are waiting to be questioned. 
  [Benmohamed] Have they become prisoners? 
  [M.M.] Some yes. Most were arrested. There are a lot of 
them. 
<H5>  B.M. (Sentenced by the Special Court in Constantine, the </H5>
"Fax Network"): "Why Escape?" 
  [Benmohamed] Could you say why you took part in the 
breakout? 
  [B.M.] I was sentenced by the special court in Constantine 
as 
part of the fax network. I taught computer science at the 
university of Batna. I've got three years left to serve. I 
didn't take part directly in the escape. 
  [Benmohamed] But you're an escapee... 
  [B.M.] Yes, I'm an escapee. I got out of the prison because 
I 
had problems. The prison gates were open for everyone. I had to 
leave the prison just like everyone else. 
  Together with all the prisoners who had been sentenced by 
the 
special courts, I was in room 10. We heard rounds of gunfire; we 
started to look through the windows and we didn't understand. 
The lights were out for about a half hour; then the door to the 
room was opened by an armed man who told us: "All your 
companions have gone; you have to leave the room." So we all 
left, no problems, no obstacles, all the doors to the cells and 
the prison were open, everyone got out without any problems. I 
did the same thing but I understood that it wasn't normal. I 
didn't want to have any problems. 
  [Benmohamed] Did you notice something unusual on the day of 
the breakout? Was it planned for that day? 
  [B.M.] Everything was normal. Personally I wasn't warned. 
  I'm convinced it was the same for my fellow prisoners. We 
were all thinking about a general amnesty on the eve of the Aid. 
Nobody, as far as I know, was informed with regard to this 
escape. 
  [Benmohamed] What happened once you were outside? 
  [B.M.] The prisoners were sent towards the mountains. There 
were a lot of people. I too went in the direction of the 
mountains but I stopped just behind the houses of Tazoult. Two 
hours later, once there was nobody else around, I decided to 
return to the prison. From afar, I saw that the prison gates 
were shut. There were also some gendarmes, policemen, and 
soldiers. I was afraid. So I took the Batna road. On the road I 
met a police car. I turned myself over to them and I spent the 
night at the police station. 
  [Benmohamed] Why did you turn yourself over to the 
policemen? 
  [B.H.] First, I've been sentenced to a short term. So why 
should I escape and risk a longer one? Second, I was expecting 
an amnesty. What the newspapers are writing proves that the 
situation is going to improve with the arrival of the president. 
So why should I escape? I'm not convinced about escaping, about 
creating anarchy and experiencing other problems. That's my 
opinion. When he came the president said two words to us: 
"Fraternal dialogue." That's the main thing. I'm convinced, so 
why push? It's better to wait for a solution for everyone. 
  Furthermore, I didn't want to leave because the mountain 
isn't easy. You need an organization and I'm not part of it. I 
don't have any weapons. To go means dying. I have five children. 
I chose to analyze the situation. 
  [Benmohamed] Were your fellow prisoners of the same opinion? 
  [B.M.] Some were. These were university teachers and 
engineers who were expecting a pardon. They were expecting a 
rahma. They were even afraid of even more serious problems. I 
should mention to you that these were prisoners sentenced by the 
special courts, all for terms of under five years. They have 
nothing to do with the blood that's been shed. 
  The others think the president should demonstrate his 
sincerity and accessibility by, for example, issuing an amnesty 
to the prisoners to encourage dialogue. I'm speaking of amnesty 
on behalf of prisoners who have no link to crimes connected with 
terrorism. Who forced this multiparty system of which we're the 
victims? They wanted to imitate Europe. There are other problems 
to solve. Personally I'm back in prison while my children have 
been left to themselves. 
<H5>  B.M. (Sentenced to a 12-Year Term): "I Turned Myself Over to </H5>
the Gendarmerie" 
  [Benmohamed] What happened at the time of the breakout? 
  [B.M.] I'm the No. 2 man in room 20, where there were only 
special court prisoners. Two or three minutes after the Maghreb, 
there were gunshots. We thought there was a revolt in room 11. 
Certain prisoners told us: "No. The brothers are here." 
  [Benmohamed] In your opinion, did they know about the 
escape? 
  [B.M.] Perhaps. You can't tell. No one trusts anyone. There 
were 42 of us. Next, there was some noise, some shouts, and some 
rounds of gunfire. One of us broke a bed to break the lock with 
an iron bar. That didn't help. Some of us prevented him from 
breaking down the door. Through the window we saw a guard run 
upstairs. Behind him there were some armed men. We called to 
them to open our door. They asked us to wait. We were the last 
ones to leave. Then we escaped. When I got to the entrance gate 
to the prison I saw a Golf that was taking one of the death row 
inmates away from the infirmary. He had lost both his legs in an 
altercation before his arrest. It seems he's their chief. 
Everyone was in a rush. I saw the death row prisoners in the 
vehicles. As for me, I left on foot. With me were only special 
court prisoners sentenced to detention. Some were accompanied by 
cars up to the edge of the forest. I decided to part company 
with them because I knew it would end badly. I slipped between 
the houses. I met a men I asked to show me where the police 
headquarters were. You could hear rounds of gunshots everywhere. 
He advised me to flee saying they were going to kill me. This 
man was one of the attackers and I didn't know it. I was going 
to tell him that the prison had been attacked but I shut up when 
I saw he was dressed strangely. He asked me if I was a brother 
and I answered that I was. Then he pointed behind the buildings 
to show me the mountains. I pretended I was following. Once I 
had escaped I hid. Then I recognized some guards in town. I went 
up to them and I explained things to them. Finally the 
gendarmerie came. I became a prisoner. 
  [Benmohamed] Did you notice anything abnormal before the 
breakout? 
  [B.M.] No. That morning some prisoners were pardoned. Those 
who were in the same room with me weren't affected. They said 
they would leave the prison by force just as they had been 
jailed. We'll get out by force, they said. 
<H5>  S.D. (Serving a Life Sentence): "I Followed Them, I Was </H5>
Forced To" 
  [S.D.] At the breaking of the fast, there were rounds of 
gunfire and gunshots. We went to the windows. I saw the 
prisoners leave and run. I hadn't understood anything because we 
saw people wearing uniforms and carrying weapons. They opened 
the door to our room and told us to get out. 
  We were all special court prisoners. As we left the prison, 
we were sent towards the moutnains. As we were walking, there 
was an armed man practically every 100 meters. I couldn't follow 
them because my leg hurt. I tried to flee them. I left because I 
was afraid they'd kill me. After 2 km, we stopped. One of them 
spoke to us. He told us that we weren't obligated to follow him 
to the mountains. He gave 200 Algerian dinars to anyone who 
didn't want to go up to the mountains. I thought and I decided 
to go to Batna. I walked through the night and I hid in the 
countryside. It was cold and I was hungry. My leg hurt. In the 
morning in Batna, I bought some bread and I hid in order to eat. 
I couldn't fast... Truly, I was afraid when I saw all those 
armed men. I'm not trying to justify myself; it was the truth.

<F P=106> [Interviews with four prison guards by Mouloud Benmohamed; </F>
place and date not given in several instances: "The Lambese 
Prison: Guards Face Gunfire"--first paragraph is EL MOUDJAHID 
introduction] 
  [Text] Accounts by prison guards who responded to the 
attack are a source of information that can teach us a great 
deal. They provide good information on the tactics that were 
used. At the same time. [text as published]. The accomplices 
acted at the same time. That means that if the attackers had 
been prevented from entering, even so the prisoners could have 
left their cells and attacked the guards from the other 
direction. The latter would not have been able to do anything. 
They did not have enough ammmunition. "We had just enough 
bullets to discourage an uprising," we were told. We have 
learned that the guards on duty in the detention quarter, i.e., 
in the corridors, in common rooms, and in cell blocks, were not 
carrying any weapons (this is a tradition). 
<H5>  A.D.: "Betrayed By Ourselves" </H5>
  Seriously wounded, for a long time this prison guard 
resisted 
from the observation post to the right of the main gate to the 
Lambese prison. Possessed of exemplary courage and composure, 
this man stood up, alone, to the attackers who outnumbered him. 
In the operating wing of Batna's university hospital center, he 
is under observation. He runs the risk of losing his left leg. 
Despite his pain and with medical authorization, he was willing 
to talk to us. 
  [A.D.] I was at the observation post. Just after the call to 
prayer. I was getting ready to break the fast. Things were 
normal. There were three guards, including the one who died. 
Suddenly there were gunshots. I looked and at that moment they 
fired at me. There were a lot of them. I fired towards the 
outside. Once they fired on me from the outside. The gate had 
been opened for them. They wounded me. I fell and lost 
consciousness. 
  [Benmohamed] How do you feel? 
  [A.D.] Not well. 
  [Benmohamed] Had you noticed something abnormal? 
  [A.D.] Very little car traffic about three-quarters of an 
hour before breakfast. At the entrance there was no one. It was 
when I looked that I noticed vehicles and armed men. My 
colleague, the accomplice, was standing a bit further up while 
everyone was in the mess hall. That was abnormal. We were 
betrayed by ourselves. If we hadn't, the attackers wouldn't have 
been able. 
<H5>  M.E.H. (In the Sentry Box): "Impossible Without Accomplices" </H5>
  [M.E.H.] A minute after the call to prayers, I heard 
gunshots 
and rounds of fire. I didn't know where they were coming from. 
  I was in sentry box No. 8 where there's no telephone. 
  My colleague who was on duty in sentry box No. 3, not far 
away, called out to me. I thought they had fired at him. But it 
was the chief of the detention post located at main gate No. 2, 
below enclosure wall No. 5, who had called me to ask to go back 
up guards who were under attack. 
  We ran but they fired on us from the street from a truck. We 
fired back. Once we got to wall No. 5 we fired. Its gate was 
open. Alas, we could do nothing. We each had 10 bullets with us. 
I had a Mag 51 that was made in 1936. Without ammunition I hid 
near wall No. 4 until the soldiers came. The attackers were 
dressed differently; some were wearing our uniforms, others 
military uniforms, others Afghan clothes, and some others were 
wearing other clothing... M.L.B., my colleague, was the only one 
to have a Thompson and three loaders with 80 bullets. We really 
didn't have working weapons. We were in danger. We couldn't even 
defend ourselves. If the five guards hadn't been accomplices, 
this couldn't have happened. The strategic post, where the 
access door to the detention area is located, was under the 
orders of an accomplice. We were afraid for our lives. We fought 
back with what we had, that is to say 10 bullets. You can't even 
defend yourself with that. 
<H5>  A.S. (Head of a Guard Post): "I Heard Some Cries" </H5>
  [A.S.] Everything was normal when the day guard staff left; 
I 
was with L.B. when I was checking the office. The guards were in 
place. Next the day guards were allowed to leave. I agreed with 
L.B., the head of the police station, that he would do an 
inspection of the upper quarters while I would check the lower 
quarters. Everything was normal. Nothing worth reporting on 
death row. Then I called out to a guard and we sat in the office 
to finish the registers. Shortly thereafter I called T.A., the 
accomplice guard who fled (editor's note: he had been 
transferred from Barika prison on 6 March 1993), so he would 
help me serve meals to the death row prisoners. This was about 
30 minutes before breakfast. We went to the kitchen and we were 
even helped by four prisoners to carry the meals with us. Upon 
my return I asked him to help the four prisoners and accompany 
them to the death row prisoners' cells. There were 10 common 
prisoners sentenced to death in the cells. They came back a few 
minutes later. At that time I accompanied them to serve the 
meals to the death row prisoners on top. Then I turned over the 
keys to the kitchen to T.A. for him to close it and have the 
prisoners come into room 14. I returned to my office. Next they 
came back and returned the keys to me. L.B. and T.A. came to 
break the fast with me. Five minutes remained. I was standing 
and suddenly I heard cries. I left my office. Two minutes 
remained before the breakfast hour. I must tell you I had 
previously agreed with the wall guard that he would alert me to 
the breaking of the fast so I could sound the bell to inform the 
prisoners. I was just at the door to my office. At that precise 
moment two accomplice guards came towards me, they were Z.B. and 
H.B. They were armed and they said: "Raise your hands. Hands up." 
  I was surprised, then I regained my composure and I tried to 
close the door to the office. L.B. did the same by helping me 
close the door. They were stronger than we were and they managed 
to get in. I threw myself onto H.B. who had an automatic pistol. 
It was an old weapon. It doesn't belong to the prison. I tried 
to take it away from him with L.B.'s assistance. While we were 
fighting, H.B. said "Leave me. I swear to you that no one will 
get killed." I didn't want to because I had my doubts. 
Physically he's stronger than I am. He put the weapon to my 
head. The bullet grazed me. I fell. I got up to leave. He or the 
other accomplice guard fired at me a second time. I managed to 
reach the detention square and I heard other gunshots in the 
office. There was no prison guard on duty, no guard. They made 
them go into a cell that was closed behind them (editor's note: 
who brought these guards in? Were there only two accomplices in 
this detention quarter?). 
  I think these two accomplices first locked up the guards 
before coming towards us. As I was running I met a prisoner we 
employ. He gave me the key to one cell and told me: "Hide here. 
Otherwise they're going to kill you." Then from there I returned 
to a control post. 
  I was frantic. I phoned the switchboard, the director's 
house, main gate No. 1, wall 4: no answer. I contacted, still by 
telephone, wall No. 3. The guard answered, I asked him to get 
back to wall 5, to contact those in charge. At wall 5, there was 
no answer. Finally...I thought all the guards had been killed. 
I've been there 11 years...The two accomplices have been there 
for about three years...They stay here but they live far away... 
<H5>  M.M.: "I Only Had 10 Bullets" </H5>
  I was on duty at wall No. 3. At 1830, I received from the 
guard on duty at wall No. 7 the chronology register, which I was 
supposed to sign, as usual, then in turn I handed it over to the 
guard at wall No. 8. 
  A few minutes later, I was supposed to go downstairs to get 
my breakfast plate. I was walking past wall No. 8. My colleague 
asked me to hand the chronology register to the agent on duty at 
wall No. 4. There was nobody there. I came up to wall No. 5 
where guards L.B. and Z.A. were (editor's note: the accomplice). 
I handed the register over to them. They had three breakfast 
platters. I asked them to give one of them to me so I wouldn't 
have to be away from my post for a long time and since they were 
next to the mess hall. Z.A. gave me one of them. 
  Next I got back to the post, it was time to break the fast, 
and I heard rounds of gunfire. I called my colleague at wall No. 
8. 
  Next the phone rang. The chief warned us to come down to 
wall 
No. 5, below which is main gate No. 2, which provides access to 
the detention area. 
  I loaded my MAS 51. I had 10 bullets. As I was loading it, 
the phone rang a second time. The same supervisor asked us to 
call the director and come down quickly to wall No. 5. 
  I called the director, there was no answer. Then, together 
with my colleague, we went downstairs. Hardly had we crossed 
wall No.8 when we saw a blue K66 truck that was moving alongside 
the wall; a man fired at us with an automatic pistol. 
  Unless I'm mistaken, he was carrying some of the dead 
because 
white sheets were covering some human forms. Personally I fired 
back with two bullets. Once we arrived at gate No. 2, we 
experienced rounds of gunfire. We responded until our ammunition 
was used up. I had two bullets left because my weapon jammed. 
  I climbed up wall No. 5 where I found B. We stayed between 
walls 4 and 5 until the security forces came; we were without 
ammunition. I'm an agent on probation. I'm unable to recognize 
the five accomplices because I don't even know them. Together 
with my colleague, I saw we were the only ones still alive. I 
had decided to jump over the wall. The only one who could 
respond was the guard who was kidnapped. He was at the 
right-hand observation post and had a Thompson and some 
ammunition. In my opinion the bodies on the truck were those of 
the attackers he had shot.

Kramdi: "First Truth Gathered From the Director of the Prison: 
`Warning Signals Were Not Taken Seriously'"] 
  [Text] He is still clearly in shock and his drawn face and 
eyes reddened by a week of insomnia convey the man's total 
confusion and stupefaction. No, he can tell the press nothing. 
"You have to see the interministerial commission in charge of 
the inquiry." 
  Nevertheless the director of the Tazoult prison confirmed 
for 
us that he had sent several reports to the justice minister in 
which he alerted the agency that he reported to about the 
urgency of improving security at the Lambese prison. The first 
of his letters was dated two years ago and thus coincides with 
the emergence of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism. Faced with 
this phenomenon, which was becoming greater and greater, and 
even attacking several prisons, it was necessary, he wrote, to 
step up security measures. Despite the precedents of Sidi-Ghiles 
and the Batna prison from which Islamic fundamentalist prisoners 
were reported to have escaped in 1983, according to the local 
newspaper EL- ATLAS, and despite the revolts and attacks on 
prisoner convoys, the director of the Tazoult prison got no 
response. None. 
  All the same, that silence was disturbing when you consider 
that that prison housed hardened terrorists while maintaining an 
absolutely ordinary security force. Recently the cries for help 
from Tazoult's director had become urgent. He frankly feared 
what finally happened: a full-fledged attack on the prison. What 
in particular had added urgency to his alarm? 
  Besides the general security situation, persistent rumors 
had 
reached him describing imminent attacks on the prison in which 
Islamic fundamentalist prisoners serve their sentences. These 
rumors even specified the date of the "release" operations: they 
were scheduled initially for 27 December, in commemoration of 
the so-called clean and honest elections. 
  Why, given current political and security conditions, were 
these things not taken seriously? "I do not understand," the 
director says simply. Returning to the circumstances of the 
attack and breakout, he told us that he was with his family in 
their home at the prison when the first gunshots were fired. "I 
had just broken the fast when armed men, whose number I cannot 
give precisely, began their assault." The vehicles used (light 
ones or trucks), he would continue, remained outside, whereas 
the police station and gendarme brigade were under siege and the 
village surrounded. "They had taken up their positions all 
around in the various neighborhoods and were letting off rounds 
of gunfire as a diversion at the time we were attacked." 
  Outside reinforcements, coming basically from Batna, he 
added, "only arrived on the scene at around 2100. Over 3 or 4 
km, the road was torn up in places and strewn with nails in 
others. Vehicles left on the pavement also blocked the road." 
But this, in his eyes, does not justify such a delay, all the 
more so, he went on to tell us, because in the city of Batna 
there are air forces. "The two helicopters they have there could 
easily get to the village in the space of two or three minutes 
and step in, but that did not happen." 
  In his reports to the Justice Ministry, the director of the 
prison mentioned his suspicions with regard to certain guards. 
These suspicions turned out to be well founded: five of the 
guards took the key to the grounds with the attackers and the 
terrorist prisoners. Tazoult's director is sure of it: these 
five guards were accomplices; they took part in the attack. So 
they are not hostages, as the laconic communique from the 
Justice Ministry stated. Yes, everything seems highly unusual, 
beginning with the huge delay the security forces took before 
stepping in. Returning to the breakout, only the prison's two 
small gates had been opened by staff who were accomplices. It 
was at that moment that certain guards and the prison director 
himself, from his home, tried to resist, but the attackers 
outnumbered them: "one of my men would die in the scuffle and 
three others were wounded." 
  The gunshots of the attackers were interspersed, according 
to 
our informant, by shouts of "Allahu Akbar, We will live or we 
will die." 
  "I don't understand a thing," the director repeats. No one 
understands how this announced attack on a prison that was 
supposed to be impregnable, and in which the most dangerous 
terrorists, those from Guemmar and Bechar, were incarcerated, 
could have been carried off with such alarming ease. Yes, highly 
unusual.

Kramdi: "Batna Has Still Not Shaken Off Its Lethargy" -- first 
paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] It has been more 
than a week since the spectacular attack on the Tazoult 
(Lambese) prison. The tension is still high in Batna. 
  The queen of the Aures Mountains, the attractive city of 
Batna, which until recently was still a little haven of peace, 
is now living in anguish and fear. This can be easily read on 
the drawn faces of its residents. It has now been more than a 
week since Thursday, 10 March, at about 1900, when "a squadron" 
made up of 150 to 200 terrorists attacked the well-known high 
security prison (the Tazoult Lambese Detention Center) and freed 
about 900 prisoners, among them dangerous terrorists sentenced 
to death by the special courts, mainly for murders. This prison, 
which houses approximately 2,200 detainees, is located less than 
15 km from downtown Batna, making it a prime refuge for certain 
escapees. 
  Besides, some of them were found and captured in town. This 
is basically why the residents of Batna are afraid. It is a fear 
that set in very early and continues to turn Batna into a town 
that is virtually dead. 
  Elsewhere, in Tazoult, where the prison is located, the 
pot-holed streets are still wet with last night's rain. 
  In the square opposite the prison, some young men are 
playing 
with a ball. A herd of goats and sheep walks lazily by. 
  A few more minutes go by and a gate at Lambese opens: About 
50 guards emerge in a quick procession--these guards were on 
duty during the attack--and, as they push on, they just raise 
their hands to stop any questioning: "I have nothing to say"; 
only those who were not on duty that night agree to talk about 
the event. But there, in their neighborhood, they saw only 
shadows moving taking up positions in the village's dark 
streets. As was only proper, the attackers had cut off electric 
current. How many of them were there? "A great many," "they came 
in groups from everywhere," pushing aside the few residents who 
were still in the street when the fast was broken. At each 
entrance to the city of Batna checkpoints were set up. If in 
downtown you could mention two permanent gendarme roadblocks 
staffed by several men armed with Kalashnikovs, as you entered 
the city, coming from Barika, as on the road leading towards the 
village of Tazoult Lambese, much more impressive means were 
deployed. At the two ends of the city, the army was on the 
watch, backed up by tanks and big troop carrier trucks. Just 
about every vehicle was gone over with a fine-toothed comb, with 
taxis given "special treatment." The same thing for passengers. 
  The more careful checking of taxis can doubtless be 
explained 
by the fact that many vehicles of this type had been stolen from 
their owners by the terrorists at the time of the attack. They 
had even stolen identification papers and sometimes citizens' 
professional cards. 
  At regular intervals, helicopters belonging to the 
gendarmerie and the National People's Assembly [APN] fly over 
the region, most particularly the many mountains and vast 
stretches. Indeed, these flights take place in practically every 
wilaya bordering on Batna. The first planes we could see were 
patrolling over the plains of the Setif, about 150 km away from 
Batna. 
  However, we were told, the principal mission of these 
helicopters is to ensure air coverage for troops carrying out 
sweeps searching for groups of escapees and attackers, a goodly 
number of whom, if certain information is to be believed, are 
still entrenched in the Aures Mountains. According to leaked 
information, numerous caches have been discovered and food and 
medicines as well as bedding have been recovered. On the road 
linking Setif to Batna, going through Barika, the first and only 
major roadblock has been set up by soldiers and gendarmes as you 
leave the village of Megra slightly more than 100 km before 
Batna.

<F P=106> [Article by Mohamed Loughali: "The Tazoult Prison Breakout: </F>
26 Escapees Killed and 114 Captured" -- first paragraph is EL 
WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] The escape of close to a thousand prisoners from the 
Tazoult prison represents the worst humiliation a government 
could experience, a government whose absence in recent weeks in 
the area of security had greatly eroded what little popular 
support remained. 
  Almost one year to the day later, and using the same tactics 
used at Boughzoul, the Tazoult prison, formerly Lambese, 
supposedly an impregnable fortress, was attacked by an armed 
group made up of about 100 individuals. The toll: the escape of 
close to 1,000 prisoners, 64 of them from the high security ward 
set aside for those sentenced to death, and 400 prisoners 
serving life sentences. 
  Of the 1,000 escapees, 200 are ordinary prisoners if you 
believe that the Islamic fundamentalists sentenced by the 
special courts are not. Beyond the fact that this will mean that 
the armed groups' capacity to do harm, which is already great, 
will be increased by 1,000, it seems that the sophisticated 
operation, from the organizational and timing points of view, 
had three objectives. 
  The first aimed at freeing "mujahadeen" brothers locked up 
in 
government prisons to prove that that government was incapable 
of operating on the road of God's will controlled by the armed 
groups. The second aimed at swelling the armed groups' numbers 
so as to prepare a new stage in the military action in order to 
attack strategic, generally "well-guarded" targets. 
  And last, the choice of Tazoult was heavy with symbolism, in 
which the megalomania of the emirs takes such delight. They 
could have operated in Berrouaghia, where the number of Islamic 
fundamentalist prisoners is the same. 
  They could have chosen El Harrach so the escapees could 
blend 
in more easily with city crowds. They opted for Tazoult because 
it is the best protected prison and has a reportedly infallible 
alarm system, has 200 guards, and that in 10 years has recorded 
just one escape. But above and beyond all these obstacles, which 
will feed the armed groups' invincibility myth and maintain the 
feeling of terror that is paralyzing people, the choice of 
Lambese might be explained by its proximity to Batna, the home 
town of Zeroual, who, in their eyes, wants to stab the emirs in 
the back by carrying on discussions with politicians who have 
never left the sweet comforts of their living room or their 
cell, depending. 
  Everyone had noticed this desertion by the state from the 
scene. Some spoke of a tactical withdrawal, others of a 
Machiavellian strategy to draw all of society into the 
antiterrorist struggle. But for some as well as for others, the 
Tazoult breakout is a slap in the face that will long echo in 
the corridors of the presidency, the corridors of government 
headquarters, or even those of the Ali Khodja barracks. In the 
wake of the economic collapse, political improvisation, and the 
suspicion weighing on its judiciary faced with its stubbornness 
about not opening its corruption files, now this state is seeing 
its institutions demonstrate their inability to manage the 
detention of 3,000 law breakers. 
  The Lambese breakout challenges us in many ways. Even if we 
granted that the few hundred attackers possessed some military 
genius, the prison is supposed to be guarded by 200 security 
guards. 
  Furthermore, if we remember the account given in the Justice 
Ministry's communique, there were reported to have been one 
guard killed, four others wounded, and seven carried off by the 
attackers; if we add the two supposed accomplices, this would 
produce a total of 14; so where were the 186 others? 
<H5>  Revolt at the Constantine Prison </H5>
  In addition, a trustworthy source has told us that the 
operation's main instigator, whose identity has not been 
revealed to us, is a prison guard who was supposedly thrown out 
of the army because of assumptions that he belonged to the Said 
Mekhloufi group, even if the proof was not there. The security 
forces were reported to have informed the central prison 
authorities on several occasions, in vain. 
  Here is another disturbing fact: the same authorities did 
not 
take seriously the warning that the revolt at the civilian 
prison in Constantine gave them 15 days ago, to improve the 
security forces around prison facilities, especially those 
housing Islamic fundamentalists reputed to be dangerous. 
Furthermore, it has been learned that instructions had been 
issued at the Justice Ministry to avoid any concentration of 
Islamic fundamentalists. 
  Apparently these instructions were not carried out. In a 
normal country, a breakout on this scale, where there would be 
no similar case, would have led to the resignation of the 
minister of justice, but Algeria long ago ceased being a normal 
country. 
  What is left is the war of the communiques. Nearly 72 hours 
had to pass before a communique from the Justice Ministry would 
make public information previously reported by AFP and picked up 
by the national press. 
  The contents of the communique gave no precise figure for 
the 
number of attackers or the number of escapees, and even less 
regarding their identities. 
  AFP's source spoke of 900 escapees and 150 attackers. From 
Bonn, an Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] spokesman for his part 
spoke of the escape of 1,684 "political prisoners from FIS's 
base." 
  Officially the manhunt that began right after the end of the 
armed operation led to the arrest of 114 escapees and attackers 
whereas 26 others were reported to have been shot. The figures 
given by the FIS are not very credible, since they refer to 
there being some 350 prisoners sentenced to death among the 
escapees. 
  Now the total of capital punishment sentences handed down by 
the special courts amounts to 402, close to 300 of whom were 
sentences in absentia. So the figure of 64 prisoners sentenced 
to death seems the more credible one. 
  The search operations are being carried out mainly in the 
Aures Mountains even if the FIS's spokesman has said that the 
escapees have already spread throughout all of algeria. There is 
talk of a large group that has reportedly been located in the 
Jijel area and of another in the Laghouat area. 
  That is to say, the logistics required to make a success of 
the operation.

<F P=106> [Article by Mouloud Benmohamed: "The Hunt for the Escapees" </F>
-- first two paragraphs are EL MOUDJAHID introduction] 
  [Text] With the arrest of "Echanfara," fugitives are 
becoming prisoners. 
  Like bread rolls when they cost 1 Algerian dinar, the daily 
national newspapers are much in demand by residents of Batna, 
who want to know more about the prisoner escape at the Tazoult 
prison. 
  For the time being, they make do with the little information 
that has been published, with the grapevine, and comments made 
by young people and the unemployeed who spend their time 
watching the military roadblock set up on the road to Khenchela, 
about 4 km from the main gate at the Lambese prison. 
  They are credulous and hope they will witness the arrest of 
escapees. Any one of the latter who would venture to return to 
the scene of the crime, the most spectacular that Batna has had 
to experience in ages, would be very naive. 
  Often their eyes as well as those of the majority of 
citizens 
are glued to the skies watching the National People's Army's 
MI-8 helicopters searching for the escaped prisoners. For some, 
the bird has flown the coop while for others it is certain that 
the escaped prisoners--particularly the last ones who got out of 
Lambese who fled across the fields on foot--are still hiding in 
town. Neither is entirely wrong. Why? 
  First, because it has been confirmed by the escaped and 
ultimately arrested prisoners that trucks and light vehicles 
awaited the most important among the escapees (those sentenced 
to death by the special courts) so as to provide them with quick 
transportation. The other prisoners (common criminals and 
special courts) skedaddled with the help of their legs. The 
revelations of those arrested, which we will publish in our next 
issue, do show that according to "rank," i.e., the sentence, 
each escapee was accorded special treatment by the attackers. 
  Next, because the search operations carried out by the 
combined police forces on the outskirts of Batna made it 
possible to state that the attackers and the escapees--at least 
some of them--are not far, but they are reported to have 
dispersed: on Monday, at their 500 residential unit building in 
downtown Batna, security forces received information on the 
presence of one--"very dangerous"--of the escapees; the 
following day (that is, yesterday), the famous "Echanfara," 
sentenced to 77 years in prison in connection with several 
cases, returned to his cell. 
  We should add that there exists a second "Echanfara" who was 
sentenced to death and is--still--incarcerated in...Berrouaghia. 
On the subject of cells, let us point out that those in bloc 12 
in the Lambese prison were completely torn up (bedding, etc.) by 
both prisoners and those who escaped. Everywhere there are signs 
of bullets. On the walls, on the ground, on the gates, the 
attackers were sufficiently armed, especially with munitions. 
The majority were young men--aged 20 to 22--supervised by even 
better armed "individuals." One of them had an RPJ. We will come 
back to this. 
  Whether it be at the staff management or the prison guard 
level, everyone is deeply affected by this "catastrophe" that 
has befallen the Lambese prison, which had the reputation of 
being a citadel. Everyone says that accomplices inside the 
prison had a fatal influence. Some guards were not expecting 
such "treason" on the part of colleagues whom they had rubbed 
shoulders with for years, whereas others believe that "hardship 
is good for something," inasmuch as today all the authorities 
are being careful. 
  The commission of inquiry that has been set up spent 
yesterday at the site of the breakout, where it listened to 
evidence and statements by prison staff. 
  We shall return to this.

<F P=106> [Article signed by "Ghania Oukazi" and "T.H.": "Lambese: </F>
Secrets From the Breakout" -- first two paragraphs are EL WATAN 
introduction] 
  [Text] Despite the numerous scenarios that have been 
advanced with regard to the famous breakout, we have not heard 
the last word about Lambese. 
  An eyewitness who was present on the scene was willing to 
provide us with certain secrets that, in his mind, make up a 
large-scale act of treason. 
  Tazoult--from our special envoys--"No one can be proud of 
what happened at Lambese; I never thought treason on that scale 
could ever take place," we were told by this witness who is 
still, even today, very shaken by everything he saw. 
  Indeed, from the standpoint of its reputation, the Tazoult 
prison has always been termed an impregnable citadel. The prison 
was worthy of being an "Alcatraz"! Here is an account of one of 
the most mysterious breakouts. 
  Everything seemed normal in this peaceful town with its 
Islamic majority. On Thursday, 10 March, at around 1700, close 
to 300 persons armed with Kalashnikovs spilled into this small 
town in the Aures Mountains. Working with a plan that had long 
been drawn up in minute detail, they divided up into groups, 
each one charged with carrying out a well defined task. 
  The first task was first to isolate Lambese from neighboring 
areas by setting up two roadblocks, one on the road leading to 
Batna and the other on the Khenchela road. 
  Furthermore two vehicles, one a yellow J5, the other a 
"Lada," went separately to the only gendarmerie post and police 
station. The terrorists' goal was to neutralize all security 
forces. Neither gendarmes nor police officers resisted. 
  Other terrorists dispersed throughout Tazoult's narrow 
streets to prevent its residents from leaving. 
  As for the prison, it was besieged by about 100 of the men 
who began by parking two "Sonacome"-make trucks in front of the 
main gate. This gate had been cordially opened by a guard by the 
name of Benoui who was an accomplice. 
  To reach the second gate, which opened onto the detention 
areas, i.e., the cells, the attackers were aided by two other 
guards. 
  In fact, then and there, Lagoune (a former commando) and 
another guard, both natives of Barika, killed their colleague 
guarding the second gate who was "not part of the deed." 
  When he heard the shots, the director, Mohamed Latrache, 
called Hama, who is also nicknamed "I-don't-give-a-damn," ran 
out of his house that was next to the prison's first gate. "Why 
have you shot our colleague?" he asked Lagoune. 
  In response, the latter shot the director twice, failing to 
hit him. From that moment on, the top prison official completely 
vanished into thin air. He reappeared only when the 
investigation committee arrived. However, he was the only one in 
possession of the keys to the place where the heavy weapons, 
especially three FMPKs, were stored. Once the two gates were 
opened, the attackers burst into the inner detention perimeter 
by overwhelming 13 guards in charge of overseeing the various 
cells from 1700 to 0100. They next proceeded to open all the 
cells in the three death sentence corridors supposed to be as 
impenetrable as the ways of the Lord. 
  These corridors cannot accommodate more than 80 death 
sentence prisoners. The cells have names; some of them are 
called "high-risk cells," containing 12 prisoners sentenced to 
death kept chained day and night while there are other 
low-ceilinged cells where 10 prisoners serving the same sentence 
are kept as well as the mentally ill who need to be isolated. 
  In the vicinity a place called the cave could be glimpsed 
made up of five cells with prisoners sentenced to death. All of 
these cells were opened as well as eight sections of 50 
individual cells, each located in an area called "the junction." 
  In all there were no fewer than 400 cells housing prisoners 
serving long terms. 
  All of these cells were opened by the terrorists with 
alarming ease. 
  In this regard, our eyewitness stated that the terrorists 
carried duplicates of the keys to all the cells. They were keys 
that had been molded in clay; this is one way of copying the 
master. However the rules are strict and require that at the end 
of each guard shift the keys absolutely be returned to the 
director, who is the only and the sole person responsible for 
the special box in which they are stored. So each guard turns 
over the keys to the cells he is in charge of to his station 
head together with a list of prisoners after having signed the 
register. 
  The station head then turns the keys over to the head of 
detention before ending up with the director. 
  This process is repeated several times each day, i.e., each 
time there is a shift of guards. 
  Out of all the prison's cells, only "the star" and "the 
lower 
quarter" were not opened. 
  "The star" is made up of four common rooms, each one 
containing 250 people, while the other 10 rooms in "the lower 
quarter" contain common criminals serving short sentences. All 
of these people seemed not to be of interest to the attackers 
since their main goal was to free "the hard core." 
  Many of the released prisoners had the right to have a 
weapon. Those sentenced to death were carried in trucks and took 
the Khenchela road. The attackers also attacked the infirmary so 
as to free one of their paralyzed "emirs" who was receiving 
care. Besides, in so doing, they did not hesitate to forcefully 
"ship out" Kamel Soukhal, the main infirmary attendant, who was 
serving a 15-year jail term for drug trafficking in Annaba. 
  The other escapees, who did not enjoy much help from the 
terrorists, were forced to get to the Ain Touta Mountains on 
foot. This helped the police, who were deployed three hours 
later, arrest a great number of them. 
  However, certain prisoners, not knowing where to go and 
roaming through the village, were turned over by local residents 
to the gendarmerie. 
  One thing is certain and that is that most of the ex-Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS] militants who had been jailed for acts of 
terrorism were freed to the cries of women and the "Allahu 
Akbars" of men that emerged from some homes. 
  Throughout the entire operation, the prison's electricity 
was 
not shut off and the lights in all the guard towers were lit. 
This was a fact that, as usual, slowed the breakfast hour back 
to the same time as the muezzin's call to prayer. Now no guard 
thought to sound the high emergency alarm siren to alert 
authorities to what was happening. 
  In this regard, the surrounding neighborhood remembers the 
revolt that took place on 27 December 1978 that was brought 
under control thanks to the signal set off by the high emergency 
siren. The entire operation was carried out with the blessing of 
accomplices, the main ones being the three guards, [?Laagoune] 
and his associates, known as inveterate Islamic fundamentalists. 
  The witness pointed out that the Lambese prison houses more 
than 3,000 prisoners and at least 500 guards. Most of the latter 
are young and inexperienced. "There are some of them who do not 
even know how to handle a weapon," he said. 
  Furthermore, and according to the same source, the director, 
who was named to this position in 1989, does not have the 
qualifications required to run a prison of this scale. He was 
formerly the chief electrician in the same jail and has never 
done guard duty. 
  Others have charged him with having a regionalist cast of 
mind with respect to certain guards who come from different 
tribes in the area. The operation, when all is said and done, 
lasted two long hours. The toll was 906 escapees, only about 100 
of whom have been captured. 
  At the end of their deed, the attackers fired five times 
from 
the interior of the prison to signal the end of the operation. 
They left, damaging a segment of the road leading towards 
Khenchela and to gain time and obstruct any pursuit. 
  This is the version of the facts as told by the eyewitness. 
  Furthermore, and as of press time, the commission of inquiry 
has revealed nothing "official." It headed towards the capital 
this Thursday. Despite nonstop efforts by reporters, its members 
have not even deigned to receive them. 
  A protest letter written by reporters present on the scene 
was even given to the military authorities in Batna. 
  As to Lambese's director, still shaken by events, he even 
received reporters at the entrance to the prison but declined to 
make any statement in the absence of any official authorization. 
  For its part, Tazoult has returned to its usual quiet and 
police left the town three days following the operation. But the 
sweeps still continue in the mountains as well as the thorough 
checks. Helicopters fly over the area nonstop. 
  Even if Tazoult's residents are not about to forget what has 
recently occurred, that is not preventing them from strolling in 
the streets, sipping a cup of coffee, or even playing a game of 
table soccer.

<F P=106> [Letter to the editor from Mr. Latreche, the director of the </F>
Lambese prison: "Corrections From the Director" -- first 
paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] Following the publication of the article on the 
Tazoult-Lambese breakout, which appeared in the 18-19 March 
edition, Mr. Latreche, the prison's director, has sent in the 
following update: 
  1. According to information obtained from my departments, 
the 
pseudowitness is reported to be a former prisoner who was 
serving several sentences and was known throughout the area, 
although no doubt better known for his crimes than for his 
abilities as a witness and an observer. My comments, in fact, 
pose the issue of the quality of such information. 
  The authors of the article, no doubt seeking something 
sensational, did not fail to accept as truthful information 
which, far from helping uncover the truth, has not failed to 
enflame matters with their very debatable stand, all the while 
offending the professional dignity of those who, like myself, 
attempt to carry out a dangerous and very difficult mission to 
serve the interest of public order. 
  2. According to his statements, 300 individuals armed with 
Kalashnikovs had entered the village of Tazoult-Lambese at about 
1700 according to a plan that had long since been drawn up in 
minute detail. How could this witness have been in possession of 
such information? 
  3. Furthermore, he claims to have seen two (2) vehicles, one 
yellow J5 and one Lada automobile going towards the gendarmerie 
and the police (now between the gendarmerie and the police there 
is a distance of more than 800 meters as well as buildings). 
  How could he have seen or known if the two vehicles were 
driving towards two different places, i.e., towards the 
gendarmerie and the police? 
  4. He states he saw two Sonacome-make trucks parked in front 
of the jail's main gate; so where could he have been? 
  5. The witness says he saw the director rush out of his 
house 
and speak to his guards saying: why have you shot your 
colleague; he goes on to state that two (2) shots were fired at 
the director, missing him. Now from the outside you cannot see 
the director giving orders to his subordinates. 
  It is up to you to decide where this witness was in order to 
see and hear everything that was being said (either at the 
gendarmerie or at the police). 
  With respect to the professional qualifications of the 
current director, it should be stated that his professional 
skills and background are known to the prison administration and 
in particular to his employer, who is in a better position to 
appreciate his competence and service record. 
  Regionalism has never been one of the professional criteria 
known to one and all. 
  Among other qualifications, the current director is an 
electrician and has in addition a proven record of 27 years of 
administrative experience. 
  I supply this correction so your readers and public opinion 
may have the right information.

<F P=106> [Article by Khadidja Zeghloul: "Schools: Lessons in </F>
Terrorism"; first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] Four school principals in Tlemcen have just 
been remanded in custody on charges of "distributing tracts of a 
nature to harm the national interest." 
  What the accused had done was read to their students 
Islamist 
tracts threatening reprisals against women not wearing the veil. 
What is it that immediately strikes one upon hearing that report 
by the APS? Only one thing: the fact that those principals are 
being prosecuted. Because except for that act of public 
salubrity, what could be more banal in today's schools than the 
daily passing on of Islamist ideology? 
  The constant hammering by a good many teachers, backed by 
the 
reactionary and archaic content of school curricula and the 
collusion, complicity, or abdication of public authorities, 
parents, and teachers not part of the Islamist movement, has 
become a basic given in Algerian schools. Not a day passes 
without every child in Algeria being held hostage by that 
fascism, which has, with impunity, taken over the national 
education sector as a squatter. The fact that four school 
principals are now being taken to court for disseminating 
subversive tracts is the thing that is surprising. It also sets 
a precedent for which the credit should probably go to parents 
who have complained. But should it make us forget that the 
schools in this republic are working relentlessly on behalf of 
obscurantist ideology and its reactionary plan for society? 
Should it make us forget that schools have become a formidable, 
powerful, and public tool of Islamist extremism, whether 
dissolved or legal? Should it make us forget that thousands upon 
thousands of teachers are devoting all their class time to 
hateful, vehement, and antipatriotic speeches of a nature to 
harm the national interest without being disturbed in any way, 
thus benefiting from the power of the fait accompli? The fact is 
that bringing the four "teachers" from Tlemcen before the 
correctional court alerts us once again to a truism: Algerian 
public schools are no longer anything but a big national 
"zawiyah" creating an "anti-November" and "antifatherland" 
spirit. As such, they are in imperative need of an urgent 
top-to-bottom overhaul. To realize the urgency of that need, one 
must first become aware that, in the words of the late President 
Boudiaf, "the schools are a disaster area." 
  After he made that remark, Algerians, or at least the most 
vigilant of them, learned that of the 7,428 prisoners in the 
security centers, 1,224 were teachers. That shows the extent of 
the moral violations being committed against defenseless 
schoolchildren. We can bet that those figures, alarming as they 
are, are only the tip of the iceberg. The veil is gradually 
being lifted from a disaster whose extent is advancing 
inexorably, like a nightmare. At the start of 1993, 315 
terrorist teachers had been counted, 250 of them had been 
arrested, and 52 others were still being sought. 
  The Algerian school system is corrupt from the elementary to 
the university level. But there is no limit to the horrors. We 
thought it had been reached, for example, with the terrorist 
academic and computer scientist in Constantine whose leader was 
an amir involved in the black market. But now the security 
services are giving us a glimpse of the incredible depth of the 
disaster: lycee students in their junior and senior years were 
recently arrested in the governorate of Alger. 
  They were involved in terrorist acts and belonged to armed 
groups. The teachers are being emulated. Any pupil, any parent, 
and any teacher hostile to fascism can bear interminable witness 
to all the acts of violence and the violations being encouraged 
or tolerated in cowardly fashion, as the case may be, in the 
schools. Intimidation and threats are used to force women and 
girls to wear the veil, grades are used as blackmail to ensure 
compliance with a dress code and an ostentatious display of 
bigotry, the youngest pupils in particular are being subjected 
to psychological trauma, parents' associations and the FNTE 
[expansion not given] are being infiltrated, and so on. Every 
kind of charlatanism goes unpunished. So why should we be 
surprised when lycee students in Constantine try to kill their 
teacher? Considering all the abysses facing us today, surprise 
is reserved for other things. 
  Redha Malek, unwittingly and unwillingly, may have provided 
us with proof of that when he congratulated lycee students in 
Rouiba for rescuing their teacher from a kidnapping attempt. 
  In an escalation of the horror, and in accordance with 
predictable and infernal logic, the schools, after first 
producing fundamentalism and directly encouraging violence, are 
now becoming the hostages of terrorism. About 30 teachers have 
been murdered and about 60 schools set on fire. More than ever, 
the schools are being held hostage by that terrorism and by the 
pusillanimity of the authorities, who are hemming and hawing and 
letting things slide. 
  But how can anyone believe that on this crucial and basic 
issue, the national school system will ever be straightened out 
by a Ministry of Education which, when it was considering a 
reform in 1993, planned to include the very people responsible 
for the disaster in the discussions? Civil society has certainly 
realized its responsibility for this disaster and its duty to 
act. Operation "Schoolbag" is set to take place on 16 April. 
  That date has been proclaimed the Day of Knowledge. Will it 
be reappropriated in the interest of progress?

<F P=106> [Article by Majid 'Atiyah] </F>
  [Text] The Egyptians are coming... 
  Ten Egyptian experts are on their way to the center of the 
United Nations. 
  UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Ghali has selected the 10 
and 
nominated them to leadership positions in the areas of Bosnia, 
the GATT, renewable energy, and in other areas. 
  The international nomination of the ten experts has not come 
out of the blue. Behind each of the men there is a story of 
sweat and struggle, which started in Egypt and has culminated at 
the world's ceiling in New York. 
  Judges of the Administrative Court of the International Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development have elected Dr. Ahmad Kamal 
Abu-al-Majd, an Egyptian professor of international law, 
chairman of the court. 
  The judges of the International Banks's Administrative Court 
knew Dr. Abu-al-Majd as a magistrate of the court in 1980 and as 
its vice chairman in 1988. He is the only Arab member of this 
court, which consists of a chairman, currently Dr. Abu-al-Majd; 
two vice chairmen, one American and the other British; and four 
magistrates, currently a Frenchman, a Chilean, a Ghanaian, and a 
Malaysian. 
  Lawyers and law circles in Cairo and the Arab world know 
attorney Kamal Abu-al-Majd, especially in connection with 
international trade adjudication. He is a professor of 
comparative law. Comparative law was the subject of the thesis 
for which he got his masters degree from Michigan University, 
the United States, in 1959. A year earlier, i.e., in 1958, he 
acquired his Ph.D. in international law from Cairo University 
Law School. After he abandoned "prosecution," Abu-al-Majd taught 
as a university professor until he was selected to be cultural 
adviser at the Egyptian Embassy in Washington. He then returned 
to assume the position of Egypt's information minister for 
several years. After leaving the ministry, he worked for a 
period as constitutional adviser to the Kuwaiti Government, in 
addition to teaching at Kuwait's Law College, which selected him 
later as its dean. 
  Dr. Kamal Abu-al-Majd was not nominated for any position 
because of favoritism but was selected for his various positions 
as a result of his education, his expertise, and his reputation 
in his field of specialization. This is why he advises Egyptian 
lawyers to study and read, especially material connected with 
comparative law and trade adjudication, so that we can develop 
what is known as the "international lawyer." This quality is 
gained only through special studies and skills that cannot be 
gained from colleges but from private effort. I hope that the 
Business Law Institute, established on agreement between Paris 
and Cairo, will perform the role of training the Egyptian 
"international lawyer." However, greater effort is required to 
train lawyers in this specialized field, especially since we 
face numerous international developments and since we live under 
intricate and involved international relations. 
  This is why Dr. Kamal Abu-al-Majd underlines the importance 
of training an Egyptian lawyer experienced in comparative law, 
international law, international arbitration committees, and in 
drafting contracts. All these are, of course, skills that are 
not gained by shrewdness but by study, practice, and experience. 
<H5>  Ambassador Muhammad 'Ali Niyazi </H5>
  Muhammad 'Ali Niyazi is a diplomat who has worked in the UN 
administrative apparatus for more than 20 years. Dr. Butrus 
Ghali selected him after receiving reports indicating the loss 
of millions of dollars and in the wake of a chain of accusations 
against a number of UN officials, especially in the area of 
peacekeeping. Matters reached such a point that a single report 
from Cambodia indicated the loss of $20 million as a result of 
"fraud." Another report from the former Yugoslavia indicates 
that peacekeeping forces have been selling food and fuel in the 
black market. This is in addition to other reports about 
corruption within the UN apparatus, all of which has motivated 
the UN secretary general to suspend eight officials pending 
investigation. It has been said that the issue concerns 
manipulation of contracts to lease aircraft for numerous 
peacekeeping operations. 
  Muhammad 'Ali Niyazi began his work early this month 
(September) [month as published] by examining and reviewing 
accounts and advisory and administrative services. He will 
submit his reports to Secretary General Dr. Butrus Ghali 
directly. Before Dr. Niyazi assumed his job, some circles 
launched a campaign to cast doubt on his neutrality, using the 
pretext that he has been an employee of the UN administrative 
apparatus for 20 years; that he has held several positions in 
the administration and audit sections at a time when rumors of 
corruption abounded; and that he has connections with the 
workers. This campaign wonders if Dr. Niyazi will be neutral in 
his private relations with some workers who could be subjected 
to investigation. 
  The Alexandria inhabitant, who has risen gradually in the UN 
administrative apparatus, has not paid much attention to the 
attempts to cast doubt on him. He has started his work as 
"inspector general" of the organization that awaits the outcome 
of his efforts to expose the corruption cases that have greatly 
disturbed the secretary general under the difficult financial 
circumstances the United Nations is experiencing. 
<H5>  Dr. George Michel </H5>
  When Dr. George Michel Sa'b graduated from Cairo 
University's 
Law School in 1954, his objective was to continue his studies. 
His young age (20 years at the time) did not stop him from 
acquiring two more diplomas from the same college. He went to 
Paris at his own expense and then to the United States in 1956, 
all in pursuit of a Ph.D. So he got one from Paris, a second 
from the University of Michigan, the United States, and a third 
degree from Harvard University, also in the United States. All 
his doctorates are in international law. The only exception is a 
masters degree he got in economics. Ultimately, Dr. Sa'b settled 
down as professor of international law at the Higher 
International Studies Institute of Geneva University. 
  Dr. George has gained an international reputation in 
international conflicts, especially in border demarcation 
issues. Tunisia selected him as the attorney representing it 
before the International Court of Justice in the al-Jurf 
[continental shelf] issue with Libya. He was also an associate 
magistrate in the International Court of Justice in the case of 
the border dispute between Mali and Burkina. Morocco selected 
him as the main attorney representing it in an international 
business case connected with enlarging an oil refinery in a the 
town of Mohammedia. 
  All Egyptians remember Dr. George Michel Sa'b, "Egypt's 
attorney" in the Taba case. In this case, he participated in 
drafting 800-2,000 pages of memoranda responding to Israel. 
  Dr. George Sa'b's selection to the Taba case was due to his 
reputation. At the time, Dr. Butrus Ghali assigned Dr. 'Amr 
Musa, who was then Egypt's alternate UN delegate, to look for 
Dr. Sa'b. When Dr. George Michel and Dr. 'Amr Musa got together 
at Dr. Musa's dinner table, the third party at the table was a 
direct telephone line with Dr. Butrus Ghali, the then minister 
of state for foreign affairs, who asked Dr. Sa'b to come to 
Egypt promptly. In Cairo, Dr. Michel pored over the case papers 
for nights with Dr. Butrus Ghali and Dr. Usamah al-Baz. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Shamir was so angered by some papers 
that Dr. George submitted that he said, "The Egyptian negotiator 
wants to win the case even before it starts." 
  Dr. George Michel Sa'b works by the hour and his rate in 
some 
cases is more than $500, never less. He worked on the Taba case 
for more than 500 hours, according to the estimates of Egyptian 
experts, meaning that he was entitled to $250,000. But his 
Egyptian identity motivated him to turn down any recompense for 
his efforts. He considered himself a "recruit" serving a 
national issue concerning his country's border. 
<H5>  Dr. Sharif Basyuni </H5>
  The selection of Egyptian legist Dr. Sharif Basyuni is 
because he is specialized in defending human rights everywhere. 
This led to his selection as chairman of the De Paul 
University's Human Rights Institute. Dr. Sharif is the grandson 
of Mahmud Basyuni, who was senate chairman and a leader of the 
Egyptian revolution against British occupation in Upper Egypt 
during the 1919 revolution. Mahmud Basyuni was sentenced to 
death, but then released when Egypt gained its independence in 
1922. Mahmud also participated in drafting the first Egyptian 
constitution in 1923. 
  Dr. Sharif began his life's voyage as a student in France in 
1956, the time when the Suez War erupted. For this reason, he 
returned to Egypt, joined the first National Guard Commando 
Division as a volunteer, and participated in the war. As an 
officer of the Egyptian Armed Forces, Dr. Basyuni trained a 
number of Algerians who had come to fight the French forces and 
to take part in the 1956 war. He took charge of training 25 of 
those Algerians and developed with some of them friendships that 
continue to this day. He also took part in the Port Said battle 
and then returned to France when the war ended. But these 
activities motivated the French security to watch Dr. Basyuni's 
activities closely, first because they knew that he had trained 
some Algerians in Egypt and, second, because he participated in 
Algerian national political action in Paris. This is why he was 
arrested in France. An international figure interceded with the 
French authorities, thanks to the connections of Sharif's father 
who was a diplomat at the Foreign Ministry. 
  Dr. Basyuni returned to Egypt, after living abroad for three 
years, during which he absorbed the principles of the French 
revolution and the concepts of liberty, fraternity, and 
equality. He was appointed as an official of the Egyptian 
Government and worked in the office of the president. But he 
then disagreed with the security agencies when the press 
reported his activity in the Port Said battle and his training 
of Algerians. Consequently, he was confined to Cairo. 
  One morning, Dr. Sharif Basyuni was surprised to learn that 
his parents had been placed under house arrest and that his 
father's passport had been withdrawn. 
  It so happened that circumstances dictated that his mother 
go 
to the United States for cancer treatment. She had to have a 
relative accompany her. Sharif had to go because he is her only 
son, and he found a way to leave and to stay abroad and out of 
the authorities' reach for a long time. 
  Dr. Sharif Basyuni credits Ambassador Ashraf Ghurbal for the 
restoration of his relations with the Egyptian authorities. 
Ghurbal went to Anwar al-Sadat and told him that this was a 
special case in which al-Sadat had to intercede personally. 
Another coincidence played a role in the issue. 
  Dr. Basyuni's mother was a member of the Red Crescent 
Society's Executive Council when Jihan al-Sadat wanted to join 
the council. The other women members of the council treated Mrs. 
al-Sadat haughtily at the time. Dr. Basyuni's mother learned of 
the story and found out that Mrs. al-Sadat had humanitarian 
inclinations. So, his mother helped Jihan join the council by 
inserting her name at the top of the candidate list. The mother 
was also the only executive council member who continued to 
associate with Jihan and to go out with her to lunch. President 
Anwar al-Sadat's wife remembered these facts when Dr. Sharif 
Basyuni's issue was raised with the president. Consequently, 
al-Sadat personally requested Basyuni's file and then sent him a 
personal letter asking him to return to Egypt. Dr. Basyuni 
responded to the call and returned to Egypt and met with the 
president. During their conversation, President al-Sadat told 
Basyuni about the details of his impending visit to the United 
States. Dr. Basyuni asked him: why don't you come to visit 
Chicago? Al-Sadat had thought that Chicago was the city of the 
mafia and of violent and criminal activity. But Dr. Sharif made 
the arrangements for a successful visit by President al-Sadat at 
a time when New York's mayor had refused to receive him. The 
Chicago mayor knew Dr. Basyuni well, because his son was one of 
his students. So, the mayor issued an immediate invitation to 
al-Sadat, who was given by Chicago a warm official welcome that 
touched him deeply. 
  This is why Dr. Sharif Basyuni has spent 20 years of his 
life 
working for legislation to protect human rights. He has 
countless writings in this regard, including 27 books and 
volumes and 125 legal articles. He has also written a book on 
Islam and has watched all human rights protection programs in 
the Arab world. 
  Dr. Sharif has held a total of 14 symposiums at Egyptian 
universities, which have been attended by 1,500 legists from all 
parts of the Arab world. Eight law colleges now teach the 
subject of human rights to some 10,000-12,000 students annually. 
Dr. Sharif believes that democracy is what will rescue Third 
World countries from their accumulating social and economic 
problems. 
<H5>  Ambassador Dr. Munir Zahran </H5>
  The final international [UN] position was the lot of 
Ambassador Dr. Munir Zahran who has been elected by the majority 
of the developing countries to be the 1994 GATT session 
chairman. This is the final year in the life of this 
organization, which has survived for nearly 45 years and which 
will change its name as of the beginning of 1995 to become the 
International Trade Organization. This organization will begin 
to operate in accordance with a charter and rules that were 
agreed to on 15 December 1993 and that will be signed finally at 
a conference which will be held in Marrakech, Morocco, this 
coming April. The conference will be headed by Egyptian 
Ambassador Dr. Munir Zahran who joined Egypt's diplomatic corps 
in 1958. He worked at the research, international organizations, 
economic organizations, and international cooperation sections. 
Dr. Zahran also worked as director of the office of the late 
Kamal Hasan 'Ali when he was foreign minister. He then became 
head of the international organizations department and was later 
selected to be the president's envoy to African leaders in 1989 
and 1990. Since then, Dr. Zahran has held the post of Egypt's 
permanent delegate to the UN's European headquarters in Geneva 
from 1991 to this time. 
  Dr. Zahran is well known to UN meetings, considering that he 
has represented Egypt at the United Nations, UNESCO, WHO, ILO 
[International Labor Organization], the International 
Intellectual Ownership Organization, UNCTAD [UN Conference on 
Trade and Development], GATT, the International Immigration 
Organization, the UN Higher Commission for Refugees, the 
International Red Cross Committee, the FAO [Food and Agriculture 
Organization], the International Atomic Energy Agency, the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the 
IMF. He has chaired several committees within these 
organizations, such as the UN Intellectual Ownership 
Organization's coordination committee and the committee of the 
countries participating in the Developing Countries' Most 
Favored Trade Partners Agreement. Previously, Dr. Zahran headed 
the [UN] Peacekeeping Commission and the Executive Council of 
the Islamic Trade Development Center. 
  This latest position at the GATT crowns Dr. Munir Zahran's 
long experience in this particular field. 
  Dr. Munir Zahran has been awarded two Egyptian medals, the 
Republic Medal, Second Class, in 1981 and the Medal of Merit, 
First Class, in 1983. He was also granted a Crown's Great Knight 
Medal by the king of Belgium in 1983 and the 'Alawite Medal, 
Commander's Class, by King Hassan II of Morocco in 1989 when he 
was Egypt's ambassador to Morocco. Now, he will return to 
Morocco as the GATT session chairman, which will terminate his 
post as chairman of the Disarmament Conference, a position he 
held from August 1993 until January 1994. 
<H5>  Dr. Muhammad Shawkat </H5>
  The United Nations has nominated Dr. Muhammad Shawkat to 
head 
the Commission on New and Renewable Energy for Development for a 
four-year term. This selection was made by the United Nations 
because of the capabilities that Dr. Shawkat possesses, because 
of his long experience with oil and energy economics, and 
because of his international ties. The latest office he held was 
the office of the oil minister's adviser on international 
relations and information. Previously, Dr. Shawkat was the Oil 
Authority's information affairs chairman. 
  During his career, Dr. Shawkat was been appointed a member 
of 
the Executive Office of OAPEC (Organization of Arab Petroleum 
Exporting Countries), and as Egypt's representative to the 
Association of African Oil Producing Countries (APA); and as 
Egypt's chief of delegation to IPEC [as published] and OPEC 
meetings. He also represented Egypt in the dialogue between 
producers and consumers. 
  Previously, Dr. Muhammad Shawkat held the position of chief 
editor of Egypt's AL-BATRUL [PETROLEUM] magazine and worked as 
energy economics professor at Egyptian universities. He has 
written several volumes and conducted research and studies in 
the area of oil and energy economics.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Uranium Discovered for First Time in </F>
Southern Desert"] 
  [Text] In the southeastern desert's burning heat and biting 
winter cold, young atomic scientists are continuing their 
difficult road to open the first experimental mine in the Umm 
Ara area 180 km southeast of Aswan, where Egypt's most promising 
region for uranium ore is located. 
  They are confirming in practice the correctness of their 
scientific study that contradicted the opinion of the foreign 
company that surveyed the area for radioactivity in 1965 and 
declared it "devoid" of radioactivity indicating the presence of 
uranium ore. 
  Amid nature's harshness and despite difficult conditions, 
they hope to build up a remote area that will change the facts 
of the region and Egypt's future in years not very distant. 
  AKHIR SA'AH lived among them, observing the digging into the 
rocks for the sake of the future. Here is the report. 
<H5>  Far From Offices: Egyptian Youth's Epic Struggle </H5>
  Although I was dead tired, I could find no justification for 
sleep. 
  There was a yellow scorpion under my pillow, and a snake at 
the door of my room. But for a foreboding from what you might 
call a sixth sense (in reality it was only God's protection) and 
the alertness of an on-site technician who quickly dispatched 
the snake with a sharp instrument while his colleague hurried to 
bring some gasoline and a lighted match--had it not been for all 
these things, there would have been a different story to tell, 
as the sports commentators say. 
  Even worse, we were in an area called Umm Ara, 180 km south 
of Aswan in the remotest part of Egypt's eastern desert, some 
distance from the place called Wadi al-'Allaqi. An experienced 
camel trader in Aswan told me that once a camel got across, it 
was perfectly safe. It was a burning furnace in the summer 
months. Circumstances in the Atomic Materials Agency had 
compelled us to go there to celebrate with them the beginnings 
of the first experimental mine to search for uranium in the 
southeastern desert. It was a mine with great promise. Having 
awaited the event for years, we agreed immediately, saying: 
"Heat passes, and no one dies of it." In our joy we gave no 
thought to scorpions and snakes until we actually confronted 
them. All our escorts had been completely silent about anything 
of the sort. On the other hand, after the two incidents, a flood 
of stories poured out so frightening to my photographer 
colleague and me that, until just before the return trip, we 
could hardly think of going into our rest house, even to get our 
things, without carefully inspecting our simple equipment. 
  A 180-km trip would be simple with modern automobiles and 
paved roads. However, on a bumpy dirt track in the heart of the 
desert's harshness in perpetually dusty Zil cars that turned us 
into ghosts with eyes, it took about eight hours broken by a 
number of rest stops to help us endure the way. If you realize 
that there was no antivenin at the site where we were, what 
would our state be by the time we reached the hospitals of 
Aswan, if--God forbid--we were bitten? 
  I did not succeed in calming myself for sleep by repeating 
to 
myself that I was not the most important visitor to the site and 
that two of Egypt's top nuclear power scientists were with us on 
the trip: Dr. Taha Sabah, former head of the Atomic Materials 
Agency, and Dr. 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Halim, head of the agency's 
research section and supervisor of its development departments. 
Not to mention that the least of the dust-caked young people 
staying at the site had the academic rank of assistant professor 
of atomic materials. All, without exception, counted as a 
valuable part of Egypt's scientific treasure, along with the 
other members of the camp--technicians, workers, and drivers. As 
we saw and experienced, they were working as hard as they could. 
Not only did they have expertise rarely found at many sites, but 
in their dedication to the job despite its small economic 
rewards they deserved to be esteemed and envied. While the 
dangers of the place frightened me during a two-night visit, 
they were the daily life of those staying at the camp and caused 
them no evident distress. 
  Nor did the jokes of Dr. Ahmad Faruq, head of the 
southeastern desert department, and Dr. Sa'd-al-Din Mansur, head 
of the mission, succeed in bringing me out of the state of 
grumbling that overcame me as I sat by myself in the camp. 
  The comment of one of the young geologists, that they all 
had 
children, made me again feel an embarrassment as a human being 
and journalist that attacks me whenever I journey to one of 
these harsh sites scattered throughout Egypt's deserts. Sadly, I 
suddenly realize how the frills of Cairo life have made me 
forget the reality of what I was seeing there--the effort, 
creativity, and dedication of outstanding university youths, 
graduates of the generation of the seventies, eighties, and even 
nineties, who had embarked on this difficult life. 
<H5>  Results of Study Doubted </H5>
  Intuition was the main reason behind the discovery of this 
site. We had come to celebrate the blasting open of one shaft of 
the experimental mine, the first fruit of work that had already 
gone on for about 25 years. 
  It all began about 1965, when the Canadian Hanting [name as 
transliterated] company started making a aerial radioactivity 
survey of the area south of Aswan as part of the regional 
planning project for the Lake Nasir area. A group of young 
Egyptian geologists assisted the company in carrying out the 
work. They were from the nuclear geology department of what was 
then called the Nuclear Power Agency, which later developed into 
the Atomic Materials Agency, and had been sent by presidential 
order because of their special competence in the field. 
  The work at the time was organized so that an Egyptian 
geologist would accompany the airplane on its daily flight and 
then would take the tapes for examination, approval, and 
delivery to the foreign company the next morning. 
  Apprehensive about the results of the aerial survey, the 
young Egyptians decided on their own, without informing the 
foreign company, to hand copy the aerial survey tapes. They 
spent long sleepless nights doing so. 
  As they expected, the Canadian company's report stated that 
there were no radioactive anomalies in the area, and thus no 
probable presence of uranium ore. 
  Rejecting this conclusion, the young geologists insisted on 
studying the copies they themselves had made and submitted 
doctoral dissertations based on them to prove what they deemed 
to be true. Their dissertations as well as ground survey parties 
proved this, and about 17 areas with radioactive anomalies came 
to light. 
  These young people were: 

  -  Dr. Ahmad Abu-Bakr, now head of the exploration section of 
the Atomic Materials Agency; 
  -  Dr. Wafiq Musharraf, who became deputy chairman of the 
Petroleum Agency; and 
  -  Dr. Hamdi Sayf-al-Nasr, who became head of the electrical 
survey department of the exploration section of the Atomic 
Materials Agency. 

    Because the result of the foreign company's radiation survey 
came out in 1967, when the work of exploration parties in the 
mountains had to be postponed due to war conditions, and because 
the doctoral dissertations took time to complete, real interest 
in the Umm Ara area started in 1975. 
  A ground party was formed, including Dr. Ahmad 'Abdallah 
'Abd-al-Majid and Dr. Sa'd-al-Din Mansur. The work began with 
the submission of a master's dissertation on the area by Dr. 
Ahmad 'Abdallah (he also received his doctorate on the same 
area). These dissertations revealed that there really were 
radiation anomalies, and the men investigated the sites on the 
ground, locating them on maps so that detailed study of them 
could begin. 
  Because the work of the Atomic Materials Agency in the 
mountains depends for its studies on academic theses submitted 
on the research areas, a number of doctoral and masters essays 
were submitted, among them the master's thesis by Dr. Muhammad 
al-Ahmadi. In addition, six students are currently working in 
the area to complete their master's and doctoral dissertations: 
'Adil al-Afandi, Sa'id Faraj, Hamdi 'Abd-Rabbuh, Abu-al-Futuh 
'Abd-al-Ra'uf, 'Adil Fu'ad, and 'Abd-al-Ghani Faw. 
<H5>  Encouraging Field Visits </H5>
  In 1983, the Aswan mission began making field visits to the 
Umm Ara area for detailed studies. These studies had encouraging 
results and were accompanied by the development of the mission 
camp from a hasty camp of one or more tents to a large camp. It 
has now become a permanent camp of limestone rest houses with 
all the requisites of settled life, such as a restaurant, a 
meeting hall, and electricity generators. Work goes on all 
year-round, despite the harsh conditions. Even in the fearful 
heat of July, August, and September, which stops work on 
implementing the mine due to the difficulty of providing the 
necessaries**necessities of life, especially water, for a large 
number of people, a limited number of people stay to continue 
building rest houses for lodging and to ready the camp's other 
needs, not to mention maintaining life there so that the camp 
does not become a haven for the region's animals and insects 
seeking shade or food. 
  The site was set up by the individual efforts of workers at 
costs less than a quarter of what one contracting company had 
set for implementing the project in this rugged area. 
  A Canadian scientific mission then visited the site and 
suggested constructing an experimental open mine of two parallel 
trenches in the hill in which the evidence for uranium had 
turned up. Each trench was to be 1,000 meters long, so as to 
follow the course of the ore in extension and various depths and 
evaluate it in preparation for presenting feasibility studies on 
exploiting it--which would be the prelude, God willing, to great 
benefit for Egypt. 
  A dynamite storehouse was constructed for this purpose. It 
was especially designed to keep its temperature below 30 degrees 
[centigrade] in summer to protect the dynamite--quite a marvel 
in the fiery heat I experienced there. 
<H5>  Experimental Mine Implemented </H5>
  Actual work to implement the experimental mine began in 
March 
1991. Twelve trenches were dug, through the colossal efforts of 
the blasting team, which included Engineer Ashraf Jawdah, who 
was in charge of the blasting, Hamid Sa'd, the chief technician, 
Muhammad al-Mahdi, and blasting technician Tariq Ibrahim. 
  One should note that although the Umm Ara area is the most 
important prospecting area in the southeastern desert thus far, 
it is one of a number of areas in which parties are working 
under the supervision of the Aswan mission. These include: 

  -  the Jabal al-Bakriyah areas south of the road from Idfu to 
Marsa 'Alam, where there are anomalies whose sites have been 
investigated; 
  -  the Wadi al-Jimal [name as transliterated] area, where there 
is 
new evidence; 
  -  the Wadi Qafah area; and 
  -  the Majal Jibril [name as transliterated] area, where there 
are 
small anomalies. 

<H5>    Aerial Surveying, Experimental Mine </H5>
  Before finishing the details of our trip, we must pause over 
two points of importance to nonspecialists. We asked Dr. Taha 
al-Sabah and Dr. 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Halim to clarify them. 
  First, an aerial radiation survey involves using an airplane 
equipped with devices to observe any radiation emanating from 
the rocks. The plane makes low flights at regular distances. 
Afterward, the tapes that the observation devices record are 
examined to determine the areas of anomalies. Ground parties do 
detailed follow-up of these areas for confirmation. 
  This system was implemented intermittently in Egypt using 
various airplanes from 1956 until 1982, when the last airplane 
caught fire while parked on the ground of the airport. No other 
airplane has been obtained to date, although only about $5 
million is needed. Seventy-five percent of Egypt's area has not 
been radiologically surveyed. Doing so would bring great good to 
light. The airplane would also be important now in monitoring 
any radiation that comes to Egyptian territory from a foreign 
nuclear accident such as the one at Chernobyl. 
  Second, the experimental mine is a very advanced phase of 
the 
search for and evaluation of uranium ore. It is the first stage 
in implementing the basic operating mine, which will take about 
15 years. Egypt now has about four experimental uranium mines 
located in the areas of al-Musaythamat [name as transliterated], 
al-'Ardiyah [name as transliterated], Jabal Qitar [name as 
transliterated], and Umm Ara. 
<H5>  Blasting Mine Passage </H5>
  All the geologists rushed to the top of a high hill far to 
the right of the blasting site for shelter from the danger of 
the small stones thrown long distances by the blast and covering 
the open area of the mine, as we saw. They said that the small 
stones were hurled so fast after the blast that they might be 
lethal. 
  However, my colleague, photographer Ahmad Nasr, insisted 
that 
the small hill directly facing the blasting trench was the best 
place for photographing--"Why else did I come?" So all I could 
do was take cover on the lowest part of the hill. Thus I was at 
the foot of the hill, keeping an eye on the course of the cloud 
of small stones as it spread toward us, so as to warn of 
danger--even if no photographing was done--rather than death. I 
found beside me Dr. 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Halim and Dr. Ahmad Faruq, 
so that we all might encourage and reassure him, though we kept 
warning him that his safety was more important. 
  There was a strong, muffled explosion that sounded like a 
shot from a cannon close by. It was followed by a loud echo that 
the mountains around us reflected. Then we saw a large mass of 
stone rise into the air with a gray cloud, and then a broad 
cloud of pebbles that we followed with our eyes until it fell at 
the foot of the hill. 
  No sooner did the features of the blasting trench become 
visible again, than I noticed that there was a human being 
wearing protective clothing standing on the ground of the site 
with instruments to measure the radiation in the walls of the 
mine. I did not know when he had arrived there or where he had 
been hiding. It was 'Abd-al-Ghani Faw, who was responsible for 
radiation monitoring and was making studies involving observing 
the degree of radiation at the moment of the blast and at 
regular intervals thereafter. He was the dark, handsome young 
man whom I had just met in conversation the night before. The 
difference between him dusty and with his head wrapped in a 
scarf and his present appearance was great. He is a young man 
from Qina, a 1978 honors science graduate of Asyut University. 
  Shortly before that, we had stood in the middle of the blast 
trench, the sides of which rose above our heads. We were using 
Geiger counters to monitor evidence of ore, whose rays caused 
the counters to sound. At the end of the passage the blasting 
groups were stuffing the holes that had been prepared for the 
purpose. 
  Near us a bulldozer is at work moving the debris from the 
blast. We learned that its presence had spread joy among those 
standing around us. It had arrived a few days ago after a full 
week of travel in the desert. There had been enormous 
difficulties in getting it here, and now it was doing in minutes 
the ore-moving job that used to take many workers hours to do, 
thus compressing the time for completing the tunnel and 
successfully fulfilling the plan. 
  Everyone agrees that the temporary workers should stay to 
work in the summer, instead of a mandatory halt during the 
summer months because of the climate and the end of the fiscal 
year. They should work on building the new guest house at the 
mission's Aswan headquarters to replace the original metal 
building that gets so hot that entering it, even in the middle 
of the night with fans that work all day, is a real adventure. 
Practical experience has demonstrated that the best buildings 
for these hot areas are those that use rock from the environment 
and that they are much more merciful. 
  Near the end of Wadi al-'Allaqi we turned our car to guide 
the other cars on the road with our headlights, so that no one 
would get lost in the dark. As the car turned, we noticed 
creatures moving under the light like the reflection of moving 
water. "No, they are scorpions," explained the driver calmly. We 
could not even open the doors to let in a breath of air! His 
saying that they could not climb the body of the car did not 
reassure us. As soon as the cars answered our signal with their 
lights, we fled from the place. 
  In our present location we feel reassured by the company; 
for 
the site is lit up and all activity, and the camp dump is far 
away as a precaution against the visits of nocturnal animals. 
Hopefully they will find what they get there sufficient, instead 
of making the rounds of the camp as they used to do last year. 
One cunning jackal kept getting into the kitchen for months on 
end and had the men baffled. They used every trick on him from 
poisoned food to a barrel filled with water for him to drown in. 
They chased him by car, but to no avail, until he suddenly 
disappeared for no apparent reason. 
  The camp dog is the clearest proof of the nature of this 
strange life. One of the workers brought him as a pup to play in 
the camp. He ran happily around the camp until he met a jackal 
and went to play with him. The jackal soon gnawed off half of 
his tail, and the dog hurried back so terrified that it lost its 
voice. It still does not bark, despite its size and age. 
<H5>  Atomic Materials Youth </H5>
  Nevertheless, you can only be delighted and sense the hope 
in 
the young geologists whose forms materialize around you under 
the evening light of the rest house: 

  -  Geologist 'Adil al-Afandi, the head of the camp, has a 
master's degree and is preparing to defend his doctoral 
dissertation. A 1976 science graduate of al-Mansurah University, 
he has worked in the agency since 1979. He is married and has a 
daughter. His eyes gleam as he tells how she acts with Uncle 
Fu'ad in the Ramadan Riddles children's programs. 
  -  'Abd-al-Ghani Faw is preparing a master's thesis. A 1978 
honors 
graduate of Asyut University in science, he is responsible for 
radiation monitoring. He is married and has a son. 
  -  Abu-al-Futuh 'Abd-al-Ra'uf is preparing a masters thesis. He 
is 
a 1981 science graduate of Sawhaj University with a grade of 
very good. He has been working since 1985. 
  -  Hamdi Mahmud, a 1983 science graduate of Alexandria 
University, 
is preparing a doctoral dissertation. He is married with 
children. 
  -  'Adil Fu'ad is preparing to defend his master's. He graduated 
in science from 'Ayn Shams University in 1985 with a grade of 
very good and honors. 

<H5>    Yellow Paste </H5>
  With these liberated minds and youthful hearts, it has 
become 
possible to realize the Atomic Materials Agency's 40-year dream 
of obtaining the "yellow dough" of uranium ore in the Egyptian 
deserts. Thus was I told by Dr. 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Halim, head of 
the research section and supervisor of the agency's development 
departments. 
  The first uranium crusher has now arrived at the Umm Ara 
area. It was recently imported at a price of about 
three-quarters of a million pounds. It arrived at the port of 
Alexandria and was transported to Aswan. Foundations are now 
being built to set it up at the mine site. 
  Three months from now the crusher will start crushing the 
result of the blasts at the mine--currently estimated at 2,500 
cubic meters--and turning it into gravel measuring from 2 to 10 
cubic centimeters. It will then be piled in special basins, 
where it will be sprayed with sulfuric acid in a closed cycle 
for 13 weeks during which the ore will dissolve in the acid, 
which will then go to laboratories for concentration. The 
uranium ore will be obtained in the form of a yellow paste for 
delivery to the Atomic Energy Agency, which will handle its 
subsequent processing. 
  In the meantime, work at the promising mine will be 
developed 
by increasing the number of trenches and implementing a program 
of deep excavation to 100 meters. This important event will 
entail future participation in the celebrations for the 
implementation of this work at the site now in its first stages. 
This is what we shall do on a future trip for this purpose, God 
willing.

  [Text] Will Egypt export natural gas to Israel? This is the 
week's question. But this question is not the real issue that is 
presently being forcefully raised in numerous Egyptian circles. 
  If Qatar has preceded Egypt and has actually agreed to 
export 
gas to Israel--executive steps are being taken currently behind 
the scenes in this regard--then this is a purely Qatari affair 
and it has no connection whatsoever with the Egyptian issue. The 
Egyptian issue centers initially on the question of whether 
Egypt has any surplus natural gas to export abroad, and secondly 
on the question of exporting to Israel just like any other 
country. 
  The answer to this question will lead us to the answer to 
the 
week's question, which we will put aside until the end of this 
report. 
  To begin, there is no disagreement that natural gas is a 
main 
component of energy now. Rather, all expectations are that in 
the coming phase, natural gas will play the main role in meeting 
the energy demand that is growing as a result of increased 
development rates. Moreover, natural gas will, as petroleum 
experts say, be the driving force in the energy field. This is 
insofar as the international situation is concerned. As for 
Egypt, energy concerns will focus on natural gas following the 
discovery of more gas reserves and the increased use of gas to 
replace liquid petroleum derivatives for numerous purposes, the 
latest of which is the use of gas [as fuel] for buses. Moreover, 
this increased use of gas will alleviate the pressure on oil 
consumption. Oil finds and reserves are not increasing at the 
same pace as natural gas finds and reserves. 
  Petroleum Minister Hamdi al-Banbi's asserts that Egypt's 
natural gas reserves amounted to 21 trillion cubic feet on 1 
January 1994, whereas confirmed reserves totaled 12 trillion 
cubic feet last year. 
  The petroleum minister added that the total reserve from 
which gas is pumped into the national gas network does not 
exceed 8.6 trillion cubic feet. But with the tendency to replace 
oil derivatives with gas, it is necessary to increase this 
reserve in order to meet domestic demand and to allocate the 
surplus for export. 
  It is not expected that discovered gas fields will be 
developed and ready for use before the lapse of five years at 
least. In this period, the foreign firms that have discovered 
these fields are expected to spend $5 million to make these 
fields ready to pump gas and to be connected with the national 
gas pipeline network. 
  On a related issue, Petroleum Minister Hamdi al-Banbi has 
said that these reserves have to be increased in order to meet 
the increase in demand for natural gas, estimated at 5 percent 
annually. It is expected that the consumption rate will exceed 
one trillion cubic feet annually by the year 1997. This means 
that it is necessary to secure gas supplies amounting to 1.3 
trillion cubic feet annually. 
<H5>  Growing Consumption </H5>
  After discussing the anticipated reserves and recent 
[estimates] of the potential use of natural gas, we shift to the 
figures of the Petroleum Authority on the role of natural gas in 
Egypt's energy system. Engineer Muhammad Tawilah, the Petroleum 
Authority vice chairman for natural gas affairs, points out that 
gas consumption in 1980-81 was roughly 1.9 million tons, 
representing 14 percent of the total domestic consumption of oil 
derivatives, which totaled 13.3 million tons. 
  In 1992-93, gas consumption amounted to 8.2 million tons, 
representing 31 percent of the total domestic consumption of oil 
derivatives, which totaled 26.6 million tons. 
  Since gas production started, Egypt has consumed a gas 
volume 
equaling 715 million barrels of crude oil, meaning that Egypt 
has saved a volume of crude oil, valued at $13 billion. The cost 
of development, of building the gas treatment facilities and the 
transportation and distribution network, and of operating the 
gas network amounted to $2.5 billion by the end of 1993. 
  Engineer Muhammad Tawilah has said that several sectors have 
begun to use gas instead of oil. The electricity sector tops the 
list of gas consumers with 64 percent [of the consumption], 
followed by the nitrogenous fertilizer plants with 15 percent, 
and the construction and ceramics sector with 5 percent, and, 
finally, home use which does not exceed 1 percent. 
  Generally, the economic value of replacing liquid fuel with 
gas in various sectors since gas use was begun, until June 1993 
amounts to $11 billion. 
  This is for consumption. As for production, the figures 
show, 
according to the Petroleum Authority vice chairman, that gas 
production rose from 85 billion cubic feet in 1980/81 to 377 
billion cubic feet in 1992/93. The delta and Mediterranean 
fields, Abu-Madi, Shamalah, and Abu-Qir fields contribute 53 
percent of the total natural gas production. The Western Desert 
fields of Badr-al-Din, Abu-Sinan, and Abu-al-Gharadiq contribute 
34 percent and the Suez Gulf fields produce 13 percent. 
  A number of projects are being implementation and will enter 
the production phase soon, such as the Trans-Gulf Gas Project, 
the project to extract butane gas in al-'Amiriyah, and the 
marine compressors project at Abu-Qir. 
  All these areas fall within the bounds of the confirmed 
reserve, which amounted to 12 trillion cubic feet last year. But 
with the discovered new finds, the reserves have risen to 21 
trillion cubic feet. Thus, there are now new fields in several 
areas that need to be developed. 
<H5>  Self-Sufficiency! </H5>
  In light of all these figures, the question that arises is: 
has Egypt achieved self-sufficiency in gas? 
  Engineer Muhammad Tawilah has said, "To date, the domestic 
market hasn't reached the point of gas saturation. It still 
needs more. Assuming that the new reserves, estimated at 9 
trillion cubic feet--a figure confirmed at the beginning of 
January 1994--are not developed, there will be a shortfall 
ranging from 620 [number as published] million to 300 million 
cubic feet daily in the short run, until 1998/99. The shortfall 
will then resurface after the year 2000 and will grow to reach 
1.3 billion cubic feet daily by the year 2009/10. 
  "But in case the new reserves--estimated at 9 trillion cubic 
feet, raising the confirmed reserve to 21 trillion cubic 
feet--are developed, then a gas surplus will begin to appear in 
Egypt, beginning at about 200 million cubic feet daily by 
1998/99 and rising to 1.4 billion cubic feet daily by the year 
2010. These reserves have been calculated on the basis of 
achieving self-sufficiency and of meeting the needs of power 
stations and of plants located close to the unified gas network. 
As for delivering gas to Chema Aswan and to the other parts of 
Upper Egypt, it isn't economical, because huge investments will 
be needed to lay down gas pipelines. Who will shoulder these 
costs? 
  "These surpluses have also been determined without taking 
into account any expected new finds in this period. As for 
self-sufficiency, the criterion is based on economically meeting 
the needs of the consumers who are close to the network." 
<H5>  To Europe and Israel </H5>
  Within the bounds of this information, it is expected that 
there will be a natural gas surplus of close to 200 million 
cubic feet in the final year of this century, increasing to 1.4 
billion cubic feet by the year 2010. Accordingly, the question 
is: where will this natural gas surplus go? 
  If the answer is, of course, that it has to be exported to 
the outside world, then to what region will it be exported? 
Petroleum experts say that according to economic feasibility, to 
market economy, and to supply and demand in particular, the 
surplus will go to southern Europe, because this region will 
absorb large quantities of gas in the first decade of the next 
century. It is well known that most European countries, 
excluding France, have suspended programs to produce electricity 
from nuclear energy. In light of the environmental restraints 
and controls have increased the cost of coal-operated power 
plants, natural gas will be the natural alternative for 
electricity production. Accordingly, expectations indicate that 
demand for natural gas in the southern European countries will 
rise to 6.3 trillion cubic feet [annually] by the year 2010, 
whereas gas supply from the current sources, namely from the 
commonwealth countries, Norway, the Netherlands, and Algeria 
will amount to 4.2 trillion cubic feet [annually] in the same 
year, i.e., 2010. This means that the shortfall will amount to 
nearly two trillion cubic feet. 
  To export the gas surplus to the southern European 
countries, 
Israel has to be the station through which the pipeline transits. 
<H5>  Three Reasons </H5>
  A preparatory question is demanded for this answer before we 
answer the question of the week, namely the question of whether 
Egypt will export natural gas to Israel. This preparatory 
question asks: why does the Egyptian pipeline have to go through 
Israel? The answer is that there are several reasons that make 
this selection beneficial to the Egyptian market: 
  First, the natural gas finds are not as big as those 
discovered in the Arab Gulf states and Algeria. Therefore, the 
pipeline has to pass through dry lands in order to reduce 
construction cost. Consequently, the pipeline has to go to 
Europe through either Israel or Turkey. 
  If the finds were very big, the pipeline could go across the 
Mediterranean Sea, where the cost would be high because of deep 
water. This alternative is not available to Egypt. 
  Second, extending a natural gas pipeline to Europe through 
dry lands will enable the pipeline to pass through more than one 
country. Consequently, natural gas can be sold to these 
countries, namely Turkey, Israel, Jordan, and the state of 
Palestine. 
  Third, in any case, Egypt will not be the only Arab country 
that will be supplying gas to a gas pipeline going to Europe 
through Israel. Some Arab Gulf countries will also supply such a 
pipeline. 
  To build this pipeline from Qatar to Israel, the pipeline 
has 
to go through Saudi territory. Two days ago, Israel Radio 
attributed to Israeli Energy Minister Moshe Shahal the statement 
that a pipeline to deliver natural gas from Arab countries to 
Israel--meaning the Israeli-Qatari accord--will be constructed 
sooner than expected. 
  Regarding this last point, the idea of constructing a gas 
pipeline from Qatar across Saudi Arabia to Egypt's Mediterranean 
coast, from whence to export gas by tankers to Europe after 
building liquefying plants--this idea was raised previously. But 
it has not seen the light to date. 
<H5>  Diverse Strategy </H5>
  This is insofar as Egypt and Qatar are concerned. But what 
about Israel? To put it more precisely, what is Israel's 
strategy for acquiring natural gas? 
  According to available information, the Israeli strategy is 
to acquire natural gas as a clean fuel to replace some liquid 
oil derivatives that are polluting Israel's environment. 
Israel's strategy is to obtain the natural gas it needs from 
Egypt and the Arab Gulf states by way of Qatar, from which a 
pipeline will be constructed, passing through Israel and Turkey 
to Europe. Moreover, Israel is thinking of obtaining natural gas 
from a third Arab country. This strategy can only become a 
practical reality in the context of peace in the Middle East. 
  Within this context, Israel is eager to diversify its 
natural 
gas sources rather than rely on the monopoly of a single 
country, especially since the indications are that there will be 
increased use of natural gas to desalinate sea water in the 
future. 
  To underline the idea that Israel will be a transit station 
for the Egyptian and Qatari gas pipelines to Europe, [one should 
note that] Israel's gas demand will amount to 1.4 billion cubic 
feet daily by the year 2010. This volume is smaller than the 
volume that will be pumped from Egypt and Qatar by then. 
Therefore, the main export activity will be to the European 
countries. 
  So, why does Israel want natural gas from Egypt? As already 
noted, the pipeline has to be extended to Europe through dry 
land. Moreover, if a pipeline is built from Port Said to Israel, 
Egypt will not shoulder the cost, which will amount to $300 
million. Here, we ask the Ministry of Petroleum why it does not 
consider setting up a joint company between the Petroleum 
Authority and foreign firms that produce gas in Egypt to finance 
and operate this pipeline. This will be a better situation for 
Egypt. 
  Expectations suggest that Israel's demand for Egyptian 
natural gas will amount to 250 million cubic feet daily. This is 
a small amount equaling the consumption of two power plants. 
  It is well known that this is not the first time Egypt has 
dealt with Israel in the oil area. The fact is that Israel has 
been purchasing Egyptian oil for 15 years at international 
prices. Therefore, the Ministry of Petroleum sees no difference 
between exporting crude oil or natural gas as long as Israel 
observes Egyptian rules and regulations. Moreover, Egypt will 
sell gas to Israel at the international price prevailing at the 
time of export, without any exceptions. Furthermore, Egypt 
cannot compel foreign partners not to export their share of the 
natural gas to Israel. If this project is carried out, Egypt 
will benefit from the installations and will export its natural 
gas at a lower cost. 
  In a related development, Excelsior [name illegible], an 
Israeli firm located in al-Ramlah, has held contacts with firms 
in the region in preparation for implementing in Israel 
complementary projects that will emanate from extending gas 
pipelines from the Arab Gulf countries and Egypt. 
  Another aspect is that Egypt has set its sight on enabling 
the newborn state of Palestine to benefit from its natural gas, 
considering that Israel can secure gas from various sources, 
whereas it will be difficult for any country to supply the state 
of Palestine with gas. 
  Another side of the picture is summed up in this question: 
why is Egypt considering natural gas export? 
  Oil experts assert that as soon as the Ministry of Petroleum 
announces the export of gas to any country, the announcement 
will attract international firms to prospect in areas where gas 
is likely to exist in the delta, in the deep waters of the 
Mediterranean Sea, and in the Western Desert. The reason why 
firms will show interest is that they make their calculations on 
the basis of market volume. If the market is confined to Egypt, 
international firms will feel less secure. But if there are 
other markets to absorb the gas, firms will come to work with a 
feeling of total security. It is to be noted that Europe is 
heading for increased gas use. Consequently, gas prices will 
rise in the future. 
  The other point is that it is extremely important to export 
natural gas in order to bolster Egyptian exports and the general 
budget. 
  It is evident to date that the natural gas pipeline is 
scheduled to extend from Egypt to Israel by 1998. But this 
schedule is tied to several considerations: 
  First, completing the establishment of peace in the Middle 
East. 
  Second, that Egypt will not conclude any accord with Israel 
unless the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum concludes agreements 
with international firms to develop the current finds, requiring 
nearly $5 billion. This is the answer to the week's question of 
whether Egypt will export natural gas to Israel.

<F P=106> [Article by Ashraf Abu-Sayf: "The 'Ulama' of Islam Unable to </F>
Face the Problem Alone"] 
  [Text] Confronting extremist and terrorist groups is a 
problem that requires political activism and cannot be left to 
Islamic advocates only since the crisis is political in nature 
and removed from the faith which the extremists peddle. There 
are puppet masters behind the scenes who pull the strings of 
those extremists. 
  The issue calls for men who discuss and debate the dangers 
that threaten Egypt and the challenges that face it. Their 
weapon would be intellect and they would have the ability to 
challenge destructive ideologies packaged in religious wrapping. 
  This calls for political education, for raising citizen 
awareness of national causes, and for developing in everyone the 
spirit of joint action. 
  Political parties, no matter their orientation, have 
responsibility for realizing that objective. 
  The politicians whom MAYU approached emphasized that 
political education is capable of challenging the deviant 
minority and pointed out that reliance on instruction, rather 
than on indoctrination, would help contain the ideologies of 
those groups that are manipulated in the background against the 
interests of the motherland. Political awareness would prevent 
them from ensnaring new elements in their nets. 
<H5>  Political Awareness </H5>
  Dr. Mufid Shihab, chancellor of Cairo University and 
president of the Consultative Council's Foreign Affairs and 
National Security Committee emphasized that political parties 
must act in the manner of a school to raise political cadres 
through political instruction programs and through true partisan 
practices. 
  He explained: "Creating political cadres can only be 
accomplished by offering theoretical educational programs at 
party schools and by empowering youth leaders to assume 
responsibility at all levels. Any political party that lacks 
political cadres versed and active in political action, or that 
lacks schools or facilities for political instruction, would 
lose effectiveness among the rank and file." 
  He added that the political education of youth, either 
within 
the parties, via the media of information, or through school and 
university programs, would create desired political awareness 
and keen understanding of national issues of various dimensions. 
It would also enhance patriotic sentiment and increase 
commitment to societal causes, thereby ending the apathy we note 
among most citizens, and especially youth. 
  He pointed out that apathy aids and encourages the deviant 
minority to be influential with its operations and ideology, 
unchallenged by those who consciously reason and realize the 
threats posed by waves of terrorism. 
  He added that this apathy of intellect and of challenge is 
the natural outcome of the absence of political awareness. The 
absence of political awareness is caused by the lack and 
deficiency of political education to which all the parties and 
concerned ministries must contribute, especially the ministries 
of Culture, Information, Awqaf, and Education. 
<H5>  Gains </H5>
  Muhammad Kamal Sulayman, assistant secretary general of the 
Nationalist Party in Cairo, believes that "we are in dire need 
of institutions to prepare political leaders and political 
advocates who understand national issues and problems. Their job 
would be to explain and analyze the gains made by this 
motherland as well as defend and explain the various national 
issues that may elude many a simple person and which terrorist 
groups are the worst exploiters." 
  He added that such a role should not be limited only to the 
Nationalist Party but should be assumed by all political parties 
in the field. 
  He explained that youth training would generate a goodly 
number of political cadres who are able to debate and who are 
instilled with a nationalist ideology and capable of argument 
and resistance. 
  Several gains would accrue to us as a result. 
  First, the ability to win over the masses to join political 
parties, thereby ending the apathy and political vacuum that 
plague us. 
  Second, create an inter-party climate of democratic debate, 
which would serve the interests of the motherland. 
  He emphasized that we can, with lucid political instruction, 
create a generation capable of serving and defending the 
motherland should it be exposed to a threat such as that of 
terrorism. Those educated cadres would be capable of convincing 
the masses that such a threat really exists, utilizing their 
ability to debate extremist ideologies that undermine the public 
interest. The first precept of political education is to raise a 
generation instilled with the desire to defend and protect the 
motherland and equipped with the ability to differentiate 
between opposition to the government, if such a position is 
taken, and positions antithetic to the national interest, such 
as those taken by terrorist groups. 
  Dr. Rif'at al-Sa'id, secretary general of the National 
Progressive Unionist Grouping, said that "political advocates 
have not vanished altogether. Some are still playing their roles 
but others are hesitant as a result of threats that originate 
not only with the self-proclaimed Islamist terrorists but with 
certain newspapers that do not have the right idea on how to 
confront terrorism. 
  That is why many of those with viewpoints to express lack 
the 
means of dissemination in the face of a flood of opposing 
publications that are well-printed and well-financed and 
consequently cheaper in price. The concept of energizing 
political activism requires solidarity among various 
intellectuals and writers who fight terrorism, and who sometimes 
go as far as countering some of the allegations propagated by 
terrorists. 
  He explained that the development of political cadres 
requires reforming the educational process as well as cultural 
and informational curricula in order to rectify the general 
climate, blunt the edge of extremism in all our endeavors, and 
seek the creation of an intellectual climate characterized by 
understanding and the desire to approach, discuss, and debate 
all our problems without preconceived views. Should this become 
the attitude of opponents, or perceived opponents, among the 
forces that reject such terrorism and its originators, 
activists, propagators, and supporters--then that solidarity 
could provide those advocates with greater opportunities and 
endow them with stronger influence. Such solidarity would also 
reduce the prickliness of political parties because it would 
create for us activists who are enlightened and capable of 
influencing youths. 
  Dr. Rif'at al-Sa'id believes that the '60s experience proved 
the ineffectiveness of the Youth Organization that had hoped to 
develop political awareness in young people. The organization's 
modus operandi was based on mere indoctrination, rendering its 
graduates mere parrots repeating what they heard with no effort 
to debate, discuss, modify what should be amended, or correct 
what should be corrected. 
  The methodology, therefore, must be instruction and not 
indoctrination. The two concepts are worlds apart. Education 
opens the door to the mind and creates visions that enable their 
possessors to understand, espouse, amend, and develop as well as 
reject the ideologies proposed to them and therefore become the 
ones capable of influencing others. 
<H5>  We Lack </H5>
  Mamduh Thabit Makki, member of the People's Assembly and 
vice 
president of the Federation of Egyptian Industries, said that 
"we lack what we might call political leaders or political 
cadres armed with a great deal of superior intellect and culture 
and extensive familiarity with political action techniques, and 
who also possess comprehensive awareness of societal conditions 
that would enable them to challenge many destructive ideologies 
and principles as well as the claims of those working against 
the interests of the motherland." 
  He added that the intellectual development of political 
cadres should be accomplished through training institutions 
within the various parties in order to become familiar with the 
party's political ideology and be able to defend it and explain 
it to others. Party members should also be given an opportunity 
to progress through the various stages of preparing political 
thought, i.e., participate at all partisan levels. That is the 
way to develop generations capable of facing and convincing the 
masses, rather than letting the common citizen become fertile 
ground for the purveyors of destructive ideologies. 
<H5>  Energizing </H5>
  Kamal Henry Badir, chairman of the People's Assembly's 
Committee for National Security, says that "responsibility for 
the political education of individuals rests primarily with 
political parties that must raise the consciousness of their 
individuals and members. That would require intensifying 
political action all the way down to hamlets and small partisan 
units and elevating [assigning more responsible roles] to those 
able to contribute and serve society and champion its causes. 
  "Such political awareness could be developed through 
caravans 
of enlightenment, whose participants would include al-Azhar, the 
Mufti, the Ministry of Information, and individuals with 
influence on youth. They must make it clear to youth not only 
that terrorism is antithetic to all religions, and especially to 
Islam which urges mercy and compassion, but also that the 
motherland is hurt by terrorist actions and that strikes against 
tourists and foreigners burden the motherland with wide-ranging 
losses. 
<H5>  Promoting Joint Action </H5>
  Dr. Mustafa Kamil al-Sayyid, professor of political science 
at Cairo University, believes that the development of political 
awareness is a function of individual participation in social 
and political activity. This requires doing everything possible 
to promote joint action at all local and national levels, 
reexamining election laws and procedures, and removing the 
restrictions with which Cooperatives Law No. 32 of 1964 is 
replete. 
  It would also require giving partisan and political forces 
more access to the information media, especially radio and 
television, in order to make citizens feel that political 
participation is of value in the sense that when the various 
authorities become responsive to people's wishes expressed in 
the information media, everyone would realize the value of 
participating. 
  Dr. Mustafa Kamil al-Sayyid explained that the challenge to 
the phenomenon of terrorism should be all-inclusive because the 
causes underlying it are numerous and are political, economic, 
and ideological in nature. 
  Dr. Jamal Zahran, professor of political science at Suez 
Canal University, believes that raising youth with a fair degree 
of comprehensive religious and political awareness is the best 
way to immunize them against sliding towards [falling into the 
trap of] extremist ideologies then resorting to violence as an 
expression of opinion. 
  He added that such an education can be imparted through the 
information media and school curricula and through the example 
of good role models by educators and those in charge of 
political parties.

<F P=106> [Article by Kamran Qurrah Daghi--first two paragraph </F>
AL-HAYAH introduction] 
  [Text] A few years ago, some Israeli Kurds presented a 
theatrical play by the name of "I am a Kurd." In response to a 
question about the reason for choosing this name, one of those 
who had taken part in the play answered saying: "We wanted to 
send a message to the Israeli people telling them that it is 
okay to be a Kurd." 
  Kamran Qurrah Daghi believes that this response is an 
indication that there is a Jewish-Kurdish special relationship 
that started in the year 720 BC. 
  Kurdish Jews in Israel cherish their Kurdish identity and 
sympathize with and support Muslim Kurds. Israeli Kurds compare 
the annihilation of Iraqi Kurds in the al-Anfal and Halbajah 
operations in May 1988, when poisonous gas was used, to the 
annihilation of Jews during the Holocaust. At the time of the 
above mentioned operations, Kurdish Jews organized protest 
campaigns and tried to adopt those children who were saved in 
Halbajah. However, Turkey, where a large number of Iraqi Kurds 
had taken refuge, refused to help Kurdish Jews reach their goals. 
  Moreover, Israeli Kurds tried to give humanitarian support 
to 
Iraqi Kurds during the refugee catastrophe in April 1991, yet, 
sensitive relations with Turkey hindered that; they still do to 
the present day. 
  Kurdish Jews state that their emigration to Israel was to 
flee neither ethnic nor religious persecution, but was due to 
their Zionist affiliation. Until now, they continue to have 
their affiliation with Kurdistan. If Kurdish Jews are to be 
compared with the Jews of Baghdad, it is found that the isolated 
mountainous geographic environment has impacted the Kurdish Jews 
and made them cling to Kurdish rather than to Arab or Turkish 
values. Though Kurdish Jews have been in Israel for decades, the 
nonreligious aspects of their culture, such as language, 
customs, and social values, have not much changed. 
  However, as for the new generation of Kurds born in Israel, 
because they have had no contact with the Kurdish society, it is 
found that their understanding of Kurdish affiliation is 
different from that of the generation raised in Kurdistan. 
Nevertheless, the latter feel that if the current political 
circumstances continue to prevail, their Kurdish life-style 
might vanish in the long run. 
  This state of affairs made Israeli Kurds long very much for 
their past Kurdish environment. It is the elderly from among 
them, in particular, who are bound to feel the pain when Israeli 
Kurds become cut off from their roots. Even the youths still 
cling to Kurdish customs, such as food, dance, music, and even 
sometimes the Kurdish language, which many of these youth insist 
on learning. Moreover, Kurdish Jews in Israel are still inclined 
to intermarry. 
  In order to remain in touch with the Kurdish culture, the 
national council of the Society for Kurdish Jews in Israel in 
1971 decided to organize an annual festival [Saharanah] for the 
Israeli Kurdish community. This festival is a good opportunity 
for them to "express their joy, brotherly feelings, and to bring 
back to life the prayers, singing, dancing, food, costumes, and 
life-style of this ethnic group. This culture developed over 
about 3,000 years while the group lived in Kurdistan." Around 
25,000 to 30,000 Kurdish Jews take part in this two-day open-air 
festival. The head of state, the prime minister, and other 
official dignitaries usually attend this festival. Yitzhaq 
Rabin, the current prime minister, inaugurated the last festival. 
  Before establishing the Jewish state in 1948, there were 
about 20,000 Kurdish Jews in Palestine. Between 1950 and 1951, 
another 40,000 Kurdish Jews immigrated to Israel from Iranian 
and Iraqi Kurdistan. Kurdish Jews in Israel are currently 
estimated at 100,000, most of whom have come from Iraqi 
Kurdistan. In Jerusalem 35,000 of the 100,000 Kurdish Jews live; 
in Tiberias, 5,000; in Haifa, 7,000; and in the settlements and 
the rest of Israel, about 20,000. 
  A number of Kurdish Jews have become prominent in Israel's 
political and public life. Some of these are representatives and 
prominent members of political parties and municipalities. Habib 
Shaymuni [name as transliterated], current president of the 
Organization for Kurdish Jews, who was born in the Iraqi Kurdish 
city of 'Aqrah, was a Labor Party member of the Knesset. 
However, the most prominent Kurdish Jew would be General Yitzhaq 
Mordekhay, commander of the northern front, who was also born in 
the city of 'Aqrah and is considered one of the most active of 
Israeli Kurds. 
  This elite group of Kurdish politicians, lawyers, and 
academicians took the initiative to establish an organization 
that brought together Kurdish Jews in Israel. This organization 
is especially interested in cultural activities. Besides, it 
tries to establish relations with Kurds resident outside Israel. 
It also supports Kurdish researchers and artists and sometimes 
invites them to visit Israel. However, the activities of the 
organization outside Israel remains limited, because it cannot 
establish relations with Iraqi, Iranian, or Syrian Kurds. The 
organization therefore has contacts only with Kurds resident 
either in Europe or in the United States. Israeli Kurds can only 
visit Turkish Kurdistan, which they do in disguise. Moreover, 
with the worsening of the Kurdish-Turkish war, these visits have 
become difficult. 
  Travelers and scholars who visited Kurdistan from the 12th 
to 
the 20th century indicated that there were Jews who shared the 
life-style of Muslim Kurds living among the Muslims. This meant 
that honor and disgrace were important values for Kurdish Jews 
just as they were for the Kurdish society as a whole. Only 
religious rituals differentiated Jews from either Christians or 
Muslims in Kurdistan. 
  A number of Kurdish Jews immigrated to Palestine at the 
beginning of the 20th century, yet, most of the rest immigrated 
in the 1940s and the beginning of the 1950s. Between 1970 and 
1973, about 3,000 Jews, who had remained in Baghdad, helped the 
Kurds flee across the Kurdish borders to Iran, from where they 
traveled to Israel. It is no secret that through Iran, Israel 
offered material and military aid to the Kurdish movement in 
Iraq during the 1963-74 period. The original language of the 
first generation of Kurdish Jews in Israel was Aramaic, which 
resembles contemporary Hebrew and is sometimes wrongly called 
"Kurdish" in Israel. Their second language was Kurdish, which 
was dominated by the "Karmangi" [as transliterated] dialect. 
These languages were followed by Turkish, Persian, and Arabic. 
However, currently, Hebrew is considered the first language for 
the majority of Israeli Kurds. 
  It seems strange that the Israeli Kurdish environment is the 
only one where the term "Kurdistan" is used officially and 
legally. Many Kurds do not know which country currently rules 
the region where their ancestors lived. The museum of Israel in 
Jerusalem displays some samples that are described as "Kurdish" 
so that they may be distinguished from "Iranian," "Turkish," or 
"Iraqi." 
  Kurdish Jews came to this homeland in the first temple era. 
Some Kurdish Jews believe that they are the descendants of the 
10 Jewish tribes that the Assyrians captured and enslaved after 
they destroyed the Kingdom of Israel in 720 BC. They were joined 
by the Jews captured and enslaved in Babylon 150 years later. 
Since that time, Jewish settlements were established in this 
region. However, for geographic reasons, these settlements soon 
lost contact with the Jewish centers in Babylon. However, in 
spite of this isolation, Kurdish Jews managed to preserve their 
religion and religious identity. In the 12th century, a 
messianic movement sprang up. It was led by two false 
"messiahs," Miyhim ben Shalumu ibn Ruhi [name as 
transliterated][?Shlomo Molkho] and David al-Ruwi [name as 
transliterated][?David Ha'renveni], after whom the Jews named 
the first settlement in Kurdistan. 
  In the 13th century, the Moguls invaded Iraq and a large 
number of Jews fled to the Kurdistan mountains where they built 
settlements in protected areas. Due to the national instability 
that lasted for many centuries, because of the struggle between 
Kurds and Ottomans, many Jews were killed. However, Jews did not 
face any religious persecution from Muslim Kurds. There were 
natural social relations between Jews and Kurds; friendships 
were also established between the heads of families. 
  Kurdish Jews had developed folklore-type literature inspired 
by the Old Testament. Music using drums and flutes, which are 
the two instruments common all over Kurdistan, accompanied their 
dancing and singing. Like Kurds, both men and women take part in 
Kurdish dancing [al-Dabkah]. Kurdish Jews verbally transmit from 
one generation to another stories from their folklore, relating 
historic events. 
  However, because there were no religious schools [Yishivot] 
in Kurdistan, Jews who wished to study Judaism had to go to 
Baghdad. One of the two prominent rabbis in Baghdad was of 
Kurdish descent. Only a few Kurdish Jews who resided in 
al-Mawsil and Karkuk could provide a European-style education 
for their children after the British occupation of Iraq. 
  Since the beginning of the 18th century, relations have been 
fostered between Kurdish Jews and Jewish centers in Palestine. A 
group of Kurdish Jews immigrated to Palestine in 1812 and 
resided in Jerusalem. However, the major immigration happened 
after the establishment of the Jewish State in 1950 and 1951. 
This immigration was known as the two campaigns of "Ezrah" and 
"Nehemiah." Currently, only a few Jews are left in Iranian, 
Turkish, and Syrian Kurdistan. 
  Will the new peace and openness between peoples open these 
folders that have remained closed and abandoned for a long time?

<F P=106> [Interview with Taoufik Bouderbala, the new director of the </F>
Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH--Ligue Tunisienne des droits 
de l'Homme), by Ziyad Karichan and Lotfi Haji; place and date 
not given--first four paragraphs REALITES introduction] 
  [Text] For more than a year, the LTDH [Tunisian Human 
Rights League] has experienced a truly exceptional situation, 
unprecedented in its history. After a marathon effort in recent 
months, the League has been able to lay the ground for its 
fourth conference, renew all of its branches, and--most 
importantly--reanimate and revitalize its cadres. 
  The "exceptional" in all that has happened is that the 
League 
has been able to once again draw attention to itself, after many 
had dismissed it. 
  The League has salvaged itself despite all that has been 
said 
and is being said regarding the holding of its conference, the 
election of its leadership, and its resumption of regular 
activity. 
  Moments after the announcement of the final results of the 
vote [on the composition of the new board of directors], the new 
board of directors elected a new director by a consensus of all 
of its members. He is Taoufik Bouderbala, who was the secretary 
general in the outgoing board. Given Taoufik Bouderbala's 
previous and current responsibilities, no one is more suited 
than he to speak of the League's past, present, and future. He 
granted his first press interview to REALITES [AL-HAQA'IQ], for 
which we are thankful. Let us listen to him. 
  [REALITES] Now that you have caught your breath after the 
marathon preparations for your fourth conference, how do you 
assess the results, before, during, and immediately after the 
conference? 
  [Bouderbala] My initial, basic assessment is that the League 
succeeded in preparing and holding the conference and in forming 
a board of directors according to its bylaws and articles of 
association. It should be emphasized that preparation for the 
conference lasted more than four months, during which the 
previous board of directors held numerous meetings to study the 
admission of new members, the branches' conferences, and 
preparations for the conference. The board of directors issued 
statements inviting all those wishing to join the League, whose 
precepts are compatible with the League's articles of 
association, to apply for membership. 
  The board of directors delegated a five-member committee to 
check the lists of membership applicants submitted by the 41 
branches. The lists were then submitted to the board of 
directors, which held five meetings to check the lists. We made 
some revisions upon the request of the branches or members of 
the board of directors. We did not go forward with the 
conference until after the outgoing board of directors approved 
by consensus the lists of persons joining all 41 branches. 
Immediately after that, we established an agenda to renew the 
branches' cadres. We agreed that this would be done through 
elections or consensual installation if we were unable to hold 
an electoral session. However, thank God, we were able to hold 
41 general sessions in public places with complete openness, 
with the attendance of at least three-quarters of the members of 
the branches, and with the supervision of the board of directors. 
  No pressure of any type was exerted. However, we encountered 
difficulties in three branches concerning members and the 
composition of the branch. Some members did not accept the 
covenant and wanted to hold an electoral session without 
consideration of the covenant before elections. However, the 
brothers who were supervising were able, after a dialogue with 
the members, to install cadres with everyone's agreement (these 
branches are in Nafta, Jendouba, and Beja). 
  [REALITES] This is not the first time that you have 
personally participated in a League conference. Did you feel 
that you were participating in a regular conference? Or did you 
have a different feeling? 
  [Bouderbala] I felt that we were in an ordinary conference, 
because we applied our articles of association and all of the 
requirements of these articles. Hence, we called it the fourth 
national conference of the League. As for the content of the 
conference, it concerned the situation the League has been 
experiencing. The emphasis was on the independence of the League 
and its decisionmaking, and the need for it to exist, so that it 
can perform its normal functions. The conferees all indicated 
that they have no wish to return to the stagnation and paralysis 
of the League prior to the conference. 
  [REALITES] For the first time in the League's history, a 
unanimous or near unanimous agreement was not reached regarding 
the League's board of directors. Two competing lists were 
submitted to the conference. Do you attribute this situation to 
the "League Covenant" list's certainty of its absolute victory 
in elections, which is what actually happened, or to the fact 
that the competing list, "the Independence List," put forth 
conditions you considered unfair and impracticable? 
  [Bouderbala] I do not believe that matters were decided 
before the conference. However, at the conference, some 
conferees wanted or pretended to forget the League's principles. 
We have tried to preserve the League's existence without being 
in a position that would permit any party to infringe on its 
legal and de facto existence. The conference is not a revocation 
of the League's previous decisions. 
  All of the parties attempted to uphold the covenant and to 
agree on a list with a maximum of 30 individuals. However, we 
found that some parties refused to enter into this covenant or 
wanted to enter the covenant on their own terms. 
  [REALITES] This conference indicated that there is a 
majority 
position and a minority position (almost a third) within the 
League. How will you deal with this situation in the future? 
  [Bouderbala] In the wake of the conference, we do not 
believe 
that there is a minority or majority in the League. The 
conference is first and foremost the League's conference. The 
board of directors that was elected is the board of directors of 
the League, which is to say all of the League's activists. It 
will not discriminate between League members, and it will 
transcend all of the competition that occurred between 
individuals or the two lists during the conference. The 
competition now focuses on the League's work. The board of 
directors will continue its work with all of the branches. It 
will formulate programs in coordination with all of the branches 
and then announce those programs. 
  [REALITES] The current board of directors has undergone 
major 
renewal and rejuvenation. Will this new situation impede the 
League's activity and spread? 
  [Bouderbala] I do not think so. Renewal indicates the 
presence of new, exuberant life in the organization. We do not 
believe that the activists who have borne responsibility for the 
branches and struggled within them lack adequate experience to 
continue the struggle along with the "veterans." They have the 
same experience in the struggle, but on another level. The 
important thing is to combine all efforts, so that the League 
can continue its struggle. The League has existed for 17 years. 
The new members of the board of directors were trained and 
gained experience within the League. The League has been able to 
train a generation of activists in its core cadres. These 
activists have advanced within the League to positions of 
responsibility. No outside party imposed these activists. They 
are products of the League. 
  [REALITES] The League now has close to 4,300 members. 
However, the outgoing board of directors deferred for your 
consideration the status of 1,800 membership applicants. How 
will you proceed in this regard, especially given that many have 
expressed fear that these new members, if they are accepted, 
will significantly disrupt the balance of power in the League? 
  [Bouderbala] We have agreed on this matter. We said that 
those who have expressed a desire to join the League must not be 
disregarded. The outgoing board of directors recommended to the 
branches' boards that they give priority to admitting these 
applicants when the admission process begins in 1994. Naturally, 
only those who fulfill the requirements and criteria we 
established in late 1993 will be admitted, all within the limits 
of the branch's capacity. Perhaps the League will in the 
future--even though it might be premature--create new branches. 
In this case, priority will be given to these 1,800 applicants, 
always bearing in mind that any citizen wishing to join the 
League must fulfill the criteria and qualifications on which we 
have agreed. 
  Then (starting in 1994), the new bylaws, which were amended 
in the conference, will be applied to new applicants. Under the 
amended bylaws, a new entrant must remain a candidate for two 
years before becoming an active member. After that, the new 
member can assume responsibility within the branch's board. 
Then, after being a member for five years, a member can be 
nominated to the board of directors. 
  [REALITES] What are the most pressing issues now facing you, 
following the League's year-long period of frozen activity? 
  [Bouderbala] Our first concern is to restore the tie between 
the board of directors and the branches and to set up the 
League's structures by delegating committees to submit draft 
programs in all fields, legal, economic, and cultural. After the 
board of directors and branches approve these draft programs, 
they will begin to be implemented. The League's main role is to 
educate and thus inculcate the philosophy of human rights in all 
citizens, regardless of their affiliations and theories. This is 
a difficult task requiring persistence, endurance, and 
insistence on principle. 
  Parallel with this activity, we will continue to support and 
defend freedoms, monitor all violations, and undertake all 
contacts and interventions needed to limit and contain these 
violations. 
  We will also make efforts to develop human rights projects, 
following the country's experience regarding the amendment of 
several laws, especially the Protection [ihtifaz] Law, 
Associations Law, and Press Law. This does not mean that we will 
exclude other issues. 
  The League will undertake these tasks simultaneously on all 
tracks. 
  [REALITES] All of the participants in the conference, 
regardless of their political tendencies, agreed to reject the 
amendments introduced to the Associations Law. Do you intend to 
undertake tangible initiatives in this regard? 
  [Bouderbala] The board of directors adheres to the League's 
positions that preceded the conference and that were emphasized 
during the conference. In other words, the board of directors 
still rejects the amendments introduced to the Associations Law 
on 2 April 1992. The League has submitted to the administrative 
court a challenge to the classification decision issued in May 
1992. We are waiting for the administrative court's decision. 
  [REALITES] And in the meantime? 
  [Bouderbala] In the meantime, we have been reclaiming our 
legal existence by: 
  1. The administrative court's decision, which suspended the 
classification decision. 
  2. The election of a board of directors that will make 
efforts to continue defending this position according to the 
general bylaws issued at the conference, which affirm the board 
of directors' decisions that provide the League with a legal 
existence to continue its struggle. 
  [REALITES] And regarding freedoms? 
  [Bouderbala] The board of directors will continue its 
efforts 
within its committees by resuming its reception of citizens and 
complaints. It will intervene with the authorities and wait for 
solutions and responses. If it becomes clear that a response or 
solution is not forthcoming, the League will issue statements to 
inform public opinion and to alert the authorities. 
  [REALITES] Some members of the League are now expressing 
fear 
regarding the League's independence. Is this fear justified? 
  [Bouderbala] For me, the League's independence is a settled 
matter. The League is either independent or not independent. It 
will continue its efforts in complete independence. The 
composition of the current board of directors, like that of 
previous boards of directors, is the greatest guarantee of this 
independence. 
  [REALITES] What is the content of this independence? 
  [Bouderbala] It consists of the fact that decisions flow 
from 
the board of directors and the members' consciences. 
  [REALITES] Must the League remain a counterbalance in order 
to guarantee its independence? Or are there other forms of 
independence that you are now considering? 
  [Bouderbala] The League is a nongovernmental counterbalance. 
In other words, it is an independent organization. It does not 
receive orders from any party, including the government, 
political parties, or any other pressure group. Nor does it 
issue orders to anyone. Rather, it draws attention, appeals for 
help, and criticizes if necessary. It always advocates dialogue 
and tries to preclude a breakdown of the dialogue between 
different segments of society. The League tries to keep open the 
channels of communication with all parties, especially the 
government. The League does not treat anyone, including the 
government, adversarially. It does not intend to act hostilely 
toward anyone. Nor does it intend to play the role of 
opposition, a union, or an association. It believes that each 
has its role and characteristics in civilian society. 
  [REALITES] The country is approaching legislative and 
presidential elections in about one month. Is the League 
prepared for this important political event? 
  [Bouderbala] The League concerned itself in the past with 
elections, especially the premature legislative and presidential 
elections in 1989. The League believes that its activists in the 
outlying areas are tantamount to observers. They perform their 
regular role of informing the board of directors of any 
violation that occurs on any day, especially during election 
days. 
  The board of directors will deal with this subject, and, as 
usual, it will have its say and adopt positions after studying 
them.

  [Text] Washington, March 10 (PTI [Press Trust of India] 
&amp; 
UNI [United News of India]): Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has 
warned that any move by the Clinton administration to modify the 
Pressler amendment to renew aid to Pakistan would "force India 
to reassess its defence policy." 
  This was conveyed by the Indian Prime Minister to US 
Senators, according to a report to the Senate by Republican 
Senators Tad Cochran, Larry Pressler and Hank Brown, who visited 
India recently and met Mr. Rao. 
  Rao and several other Indian leaders the Senators met 
deplored the harm done to Indo-American relations by the 
statements of Assistant Secretary of State, Ms. Robin Raphel, on 
Kashmir, questioning the State's permanent accession to India. 
  When the US Charge D'Affaires, Mr. Kenneth Brill, tried to 
find an excuse for her by saying that Raphel's statement was 
casual and "off the record" (which was not true, her briefing to 
correspondents from South Asia was on "background", i.e., 
attributable to a senior administration official), Rao reported: 
"The statement was nevertheless appalling. Wherever it came from 
and whatever the motivation, it hurts." 
  Though the Senators visited India in December last year, Mr. 
Rao's statement on Pressler amendment acquires significance in 
the wake of reports of Clinton administration's proposal to seek 
a one-time waiver to the amendment to allow Pakistan acquire the 
deadly F-16S. 
  The Senators quoted Rao as saying: "The Prime Minister moved 
immediately to the Indo-Pakistan relationship, especially the 
Kashmir situation and the destabilising impact of any change in 
the Pressler amendment's restrictions on US aid to Pakistan 
because of its nuclear programme." 
  It was in this context he said that any move to change 
Pressler and resume aid to Pakistan "would force India to 
reassess its defence policy." 
  Rao told the Senators that statements on Kashmir by 
officials 
like Robin Raphel would not improve Indo-US relations. 
  When Senator Brown said that India's economic reforms were 
significant but relatively unknown in the US and that a visit by 
the Prime Minister would be well-received especially by the US 
financial community, Rao said his Ambassador in Washington 
(Siddhartha Shankar Ray) had also been urging him to visit the 
US. 
  The F-16 aircraft had been on order with Lockheed 
Corporation, but deliveries had been barred under Pressler 
amendment restrictions, although Islamabad had paid an advance 
of 658 million dollars. The stymied aircraft deal has been a 
sore point in Pak-US relations and Islamabad has left no stone 
unturned in its lobbying efforts with the administration and 
members of Congress to clear the deal. 
  Mr. Frank Wisner, Under Secretary for Defense, informed 
Senator Pressler of the administration's intention to consider a 
one-time lifting of the Pressler amendment in order to 
accommodate the aircraft deal. Senator Pressler told reporters 
that he was concerned at the move, which was likely to be made 
at the House-Senate Conference committee on the State 
Department's Appropriations Bill, since a one-time exception 
would practically amount to repealing the amendment. 
  "It is the only piece of non-proliferation legislation on 
the 
books, and I think we should be building on it," the Senator 
said. "Bringing F-16's into the region would trigger another 
arms race," he added. 
  As soon as he was informed about the move, Sen. Pressler 
wrote to President Bill Clinton yesterday, seeking "five minutes 
at your earliest convenience to discuss nuclear 
non-proliferation policy." To stress the urgency of the 
situation, the Senator offered to meet "in your office, or 
during a morning run." 
  The letter makes clear Sen. Pressler's deep concerns over 
the 
issue: "Should such a meeting prove impossible to schedule, I 
will raise this issue the next time I am at the White House, or 
if you should visit the Senate. 
  While I would rather not raise this issue in such a public 
setting, I think it is critical for the administration, to send 
a consistent signal about the importance of nuclear 
non-proliferation. 
  "Copies of the letter to the President have been sent to 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defence Secretary 
William Perry, which suggests, that Sen. Pressler intends to 
take up the issue with the two officials. 
  Sen. Pressler pointed out that the Clinton administration 
last November had proposed draft foreign aid legislation that 
would leave out country-specific language, in effect putting an 
end to the Pakistan-specific Pressler amendment. 
  But in the face of determined opposition from Sen. Pressler, 
Senator John Glenn of Ohio and others, the administration beat a 
hasty retreat, claiming that even if the Pressler amendment had 
been repealed, aid to Pakistan would not have been provided as 
long as Pakistan retained its nuclear weapons capability. 
  "I want the people to know what is being proposed," Sen. 
Pressler said. What the defence department was proposing was 
inconsistent with the position of the State department. He 
called on all concerned citizens to write to their legislators 
to take up the matter with members of the House-Senate 
Conference Committee. 
  Sen. Pressler said he believed that part of the reason for 
the new move was, pressure on the Defence Department by Lockheed 
Corporation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Arms for Pakistan"] </F>
  [Text] The Clinton administration's proposal to resume the 
supply of arms to Pakistan threatens not just the military 
balance in the south Asian region, but also India's move towards 
economic liberalisation and reform. While the reports on the 
U.S. government's thinking on providing a "one-time" waiver to 
the Pressler amendment, which bars military sales to Islamabad, 
have focussed on the nuclear-capable F-16 aircraft, the effect 
of the exemption will have a wider and more drastic impact. This 
is because, in addition to the 71 F-16s already paid for, there 
are three Harpoon-armed P3C Orion maritime surveillance 
aircraft, along with a variety of electronic warfare equipment, 
that could also become eligible for shipment. Adding 71 
fourth-generation fighters like the F-16s to the 37 that 
Islamabad already has will tilt the balance of air power against 
India since it has at present only some 45 aircraft of 
equivalent capability in the form of Mirage 2000s. 
  Perhaps the most questionable aspect of the Clinton 
administration's proposal is that, notwithstanding the failure 
that necessitated the 1990 application of the Pressler amendment 
in the first place, it is once again being projected as a means 
of curbing Pakistan's nuclear ambitions. The F-16s are capable 
of delivering nuclear weapons; in effect what the U.S. is 
proposing to do is to provide Islamabad with 71 aircraft 
equipped with a variety of electronic means to penetrate the 
adversaries' air space and deliver nuclear weapons on target 
with great accuracy. This makes a mockery of Washington's claim 
that it is seeking to freeze and "roll back" nuclear weapons' 
programmes in the region, and indeed the world. It also scoffs 
at the U.S. law which in 1990 barred arms sales to Pakistan when 
the White House found itself unable to certify that Islamabad 
did not possess a nuclear explosive device. Another factor which 
merits consideration is that the American move will seriously 
jeopardise the economic reform process in India. In the early 
1980s when it had to counterbalance the U.S. arms package to 
Pakistan, India exercised the option of acquiring high-quality 
equipment at threshold prices from the erstwhile Soviet Union. 
Though the purchase was made in favourable deferred rupee terms, 
it took India's defence expenditures to new highs, peaking at 
some four per cent of the GDP in 1986-87. Following the 
dissolution of its ally, India has faced great difficulty in 
maintaining the equipment, but it could take a relatively 
relaxed stance knowing that, with the Pressler amendment in 
force, Pakistan, too, was similarly handicapped. As a result, 
defence expenditures declined, and from 1990 onwards have been 
dipping below the figure of three per cent of the GDP. This 
helped India to implement its programme of economic 
restructuring and liberalisation, which is beginning to show 
results. Earlier this year, the finance minister was able to 
announce that the country would repay its IMF loan ahead of 
schedule. Recently the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, 
noted that the new American arms package to Pakistan could cause 
India to re-think its defence policy. If India is forced on this 
path, not only will it not be able to repay the IMF loan, but 
perhaps be compelled to incur more debts.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 27. -- An unscheduled debate on 
important Foreign Affairs took place in the Lok Sabha today. 
During question hour the Opposition expressed its strong 
reaction to the recent "anti-Indian" statements made by 
Washington. 
  The External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, said that 
India has told USA that the views expressed by President Clinton 
and other officials on Jammu and Kashmir will affect relations 
between the two countries. 
  However, he added that the Indian representative there had 
already replied to the anti-India views, so there was no need 
for him or the Prime Minister to take up the matter with the 
U.S. President or the Secretary of State. 
  Mr. Dinesh Singh's defence of the Government's low-key 
reaction to the statements of President Bill Clinton and the 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs on 
Kashmir and Punjab was resented strongly by a section of the 
Opposition. Mr. Singh justified the Government stance saying 
that the U.S. Administration had "corrected" its earlier stance 
stating "that these views do not constitute and should not be 
construed to imply any change in the U.S. policy". He said that 
India, thus, should accept it. 
  The Minister said the unanimous resolution on Kashmir passed 
by Parliament last week and the statements of the Indian 
Ambassador to the USA and the Government spokesmen had an impact 
the world over. 
  Earlier, the Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr. 
R.L. 
Bhatia, while answering supplementaries said that India was 
doing everything to tell the world that the present situation in 
Jammu and Kashmir was the result of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism 
in the state. However, he said, Kashmir was a bilateral issue 
between India and Pakistan, which should be resolved within the 
framework of the Shimla Agreement. No other country would be 
allowed to mediate on the issue, he said. 
  The Home Minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, told the Rajya Sabha 
that 
the Government was committed to greater transparency in its 
handling of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and had initiated 
strenuous efforts to reactivate political activity, adds PTI 
[Press Trust or India]. 
  Moving a statutory resolution seeking further extension of 
President's rule in the State for a period of six months from 
March 3 in the House, Mr. Chavan quoting the Governor's report 
said there had been a visible improvement in the situation. 
  He said that as a part of greater transparency the 
Government 
had allowed a delegation of the International Commission of 
jurists and three ambassadors from the European Commission to 
visit Kashmir. 
  Meanwhile, 20 people including 10 militants, two of them 
self-styled commanders, and three women were killed while 14 
others including an area commander were arrested in the Kashmir 
valley overnight.

<F P=106> [Article by Abhay Vaidya: "India, U.S. Heading for Conflict"] </F>
  [Text] Washington, March 12. New Delhi and Washington 
appear to be heading for yet another round of acrimonious 
exchange with the Clinton administration's reported move to 
deliver 71 F-16 fighter planes to Pakistan. 
  It is as yet unclear whether the administration is 
considering an unconditional delivery of the planes or whether, 
it plans to obtain specific, nuclear non-proliferation-related 
assurances from Islamabad prior to any delivery. 
  The possibility of a qualitative shift in the weapons 
balance 
in South Asia came into sharp focus when the South Dakota 
Republican Senator, Mr. Larry Pressler, disclosed that the US 
defence department was keen on completing the sale deed of the 
combat aircrafts to Pakistan. 
  Further corroboration of the F-16 transfer was provided on 
the very next day by Ms. Robin Raphel, the assistant secretary 
of state for South Asia. 
  During a testimony to the house foreign affairs 
sub-committee 
on Asia and the Pacific, Ms. Raphel said that the aircrafts in 
question had already been sold to Pakistan; it was now just a 
matter of delivery. 
  She said that certain aspects of amendment which applied to 
the transfer of the fighter planes, could still be used as a 
"leverage" to persuade Pakistan to cap its nuclear programme. 
  This unfolding episode forcefully reinforces yet again, the 
perception of an unabated deterioration in Indo-US relations. 
  This was reflected in a March 9 New Delhi-datelined dispatch 
in THE NEW YORK TIMES. The report, "US Remarks Over Kashmir 
Anger Indians" said that for now, the Indian government's 
unhappiness with the Clinton administration "seem minimal, 
although the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has shelved 
plans to visit Washington soon." 
  Speaking to THE TIMES OF INDIA, Dr. Sumit Ganguly, a 
researcher at the Woodrow Wilson Centre observed that the 
Indo-US relations under the Clinton administration had suffered 
enormously "because of a number of careless, thoughtless, and 
tactless statements" and gestures by administration officials. 
  These included some routine letters from the White House 
over 
which there was no supervision and "a couple of singularly 
tactless statements" by Ms. Raphel. 
  In contrast to popular perception in India, Washington was 
not obsessed with Kashmir, Dr. Ganguly noted, pointing out that 
the secretary of state, Mr. Warren Christopher, did not even 
mention Kashmir in any of his prepared testimonies. 
  The administration was concerned about nuclear 
non-proliferation, but without devoting the same intensity of 
attention to India-Pakistan, as to Iran, Iraq and North Korea. 
  Fourteen months into the Clinton regime, the damage to 
Indo-US relations appears unabated with the White House 
continuing to issue auto-signed letters to reply to anti-Indian 
Congressmen who repeatedly refer to the Indian state of Punjab, 
as "Punjab, Khalistan." 
  American scholars and administration officials, however, 
have 
termed the Indian protests as an "over-reaction" to minor issues 
and gestures by politicians towards their constituents. 
  Some analysts, however, point to the Clinton 
administration's 
bankruptcy on foreign policy issues, with recent US diplomatic 
conflicts even with such allies as Japan, France and Britain. 
  By the same token, these analysts say that if India wants to 
be taken seriously by the US in its foreign policy 
considerations, tangible actions showing displeasure with the US 
would have to be seriously considered. 
  "The US will not take India's position on Kashmir seriously 
unless New Delhi demonstrates that it means business and that it 
is prepared to put an end to international terrorism by 
undertaking a hot pursuit of terrorists directly into Pakistan," 
a Washington-based Indian-American analyst said. 
  He added that such a legitimate move aimed at eliminating 
terrorist training camps in Pakistan "would ring the right 
belles at the situation room in the White House." 
  The Clinton administration's latest act of insensitivity 
towards India, is the administration's reported attempt to 
proceed with the sale of F-16 combat aircrafts to Pakistan. It 
is not difficult to visualise the enormous damage that such a 
decision would do, if carried through without meaningful and 
verifiable nuclear-related assurances from Islamabad. 
  Mr. Selig Harrison, a foreign policy expert at the Carnegie 
Endowment was aghast when informed of the F-16 delivery 
proposal. The US policy of delivery arms to Pakistan seemed to 
resemble the motions of a revolving door, he said, with 
successive administrations, appeasing Islamabad with military 
aid, only to withdraw it later. 
  The decision to deliver F-16s to Pakistan "couldn't have 
come 
at a worst time in Indo-US relations," said Mr. Harrison in an 
interview with THE TIMES OF INDIA. 
  He pointed out that the rhetorical exchange between New 
Delhi 
and Washington had "already given the impression of a US tilt 
towards Pakistan." 
  Mr. Michael Krepon, another analyst at the Henry L. Stimson 
Centre said it was probable that the US would demand specific 
nuclear-related steps from Pakistan before delivering the F-16s. 
  "My reading is that there is some sentiment to waive 
Pressler 
but only if Pakistan takes verifiable and concrete steps that 
are in support of US non-proliferation policies," Mr. Krepon 
told THE TIMES OF INDIA. 
  "This administration came in on a platform that focussed far 
more upon American domestic revival further than any grand 
promises of dramatic changes in foreign policy," Dr. Ganguly 
said. 
  "Foreign policy has not been the principle concern of this 
administration when it came and it has not been since the past 
year in office." 
  The priorities were unlikely to change significantly, Dr. 
Ganguly said, as President Clinton remained focussed on the 
domestic economy and other national issues such as health care 
reforms, job retraining and social welfare.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Bullying Tactics"] </F>
  [Text] The unwarranted decision of the U.S. President, Mr. 
Bill Clinton, to reactivate the Super 301 provision of the 
American Omnibus Trade Act can at best be attributed to his 
political problems at home, and at worst to the U.S.'s total 
disregard for a multilateral trade regime. Facing declining 
popularity at home and the whiff of scandal, Mr. Clinton might 
have decided to demonstrate his machismo and secure an 
improvement in his popularity ratings by talking tough with the 
Japanese. It is equally possible that, with barely a month left 
for the ministerial meeting of the Uruguay Round of trade 
negotiations at Marrakesh in Morocco, the U.S. has deliberately 
decided to cock a snook at the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade [GATT] by reactivating a provision Act that symbolises the 
arrogant unilateralism of the world's richest nation. The 
revival of Super 301, an instrument that the U.S. government 
claims will be used to pry open inaccessible markets, makes a 
mockery of all that has been painstakingly achieved by trade 
negotiators at the Uruguay Round. The decision has ostensibly 
been provoked by the Japanese refusal to play ball. It is true 
that Tokyo has not demonstrated its full commitment to the 
principles of free trade and multilateralism that it preaches to 
others, particularly to developing countries like India. It is 
also true that the U.S. political leadership has been unable to 
keep pace with the deft diplomatic footwork of the Japanese. 
  Pique, however, cannot be the basis of policy. If Washington 
is aggrieved that the Japanese have resorted to unfair trade 
practices, then the matter should be referred to GATT's dispute 
settlement mechanism. Developing countries, worried about their 
own trade prospects, are bound to ask whether the Uruguay Round 
was not a waste of time if the U.S. can continue to act 
unilaterally with impunity. While the present U.S. move is aimed 
against the Japanese, India, which has in the past faced the 
threat of action based on both Super 301 and Special 301, may 
have to worry about a similar response in its case. The U.S. 
pressure on India to liberalise the import of consumer goods is 
patently unjustified since the Indian government has clearly 
stated that it has a medium-term agenda of trade liberalisation 
which has to take into account the interests of domestic 
industry in the transition period. The Indian government has 
demonstrated its commitment to trade liberalisation once again 
in the Union budget for 1994-95. However, the pace of 
liberalisation cannot be increased under external pressure. 
Indeed, such pressure can only be counter-productive in a 
democracy where governments are sensitive to opposition 
criticism, as Mr. Clinton should know. The U.S. government must 
appreciate the fact that, despite its refusal to comply with the 
multilateral rules of the game in areas such as textiles trade, 
where the U.S. has bullied the world into a slower phasing out 
of the Multifibre Agreement, it is the developing countries 
which have shown a greater commitment to multilateralism despite 
their unenviable economic conditions and prospects.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 2 (UNI [United News of India]): The 
Home Minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, on Wednesday accused the United 
States of meddling in Kashmir and went to the extent of 
questioning the locus standi of President Bill Clinton and his 
administration challenging the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to 
India. 
  In a hard-hitting reply in the Lok Sabha to the debate on 
the 
resolution extending the President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir 
by another six months from Thursday, he said the United States 
had a vested interest in the matter. 
  The House later unanimously adopted the resolution, which 
has 
already been approved by the Rajya Sabha. 
  In the first-ever strong criticism of the current US 
position 
on Kashmir by a senior government representative, Mr. Chavan 
said the United States was "neither interested in helping 
Pakistan or India, but helping themselves." 
  "We have to be on guard," said Mr. Chavan, wondering "what 
really are their (US) intentions." The Home Minister said the 
United States had raked up the issue of human rights in Kashmir 
as a sort of balancing act. 
  He said Washington was thinking in terms of declaring 
Pakistan as a State sponsoring terrorism in Kashmir. But just to 
maintain a balance between that country and India, it played up 
the issue of human rights in Kashmir. 
  Mr. Chavan said both United States and Pakistan had no 
"right 
or credibility" to talk of human rights and went on to recall 
how human rights were crushed by the former when its supreme 
national interests were involved. 
  As for Pakistan, it was "ridiculous" for it to talk of human 
rights, he said amid cheers and mentioned how human rights were 
trampled upon in the provinces of Baluchistan, Sind and 
elsewhere in that country. 
  Mr. Chavan said he could not believe that Mr. Clinton had 
not 
been properly briefed on Kashmir. Again, he said, the statements 
of administration official Robin Raphel questioning the Kashmir 
accession to India were rather consistent. 
  On the other hand, three republican Senators and former US 
Ambassador to New Delhi Patrick Moynihan, who had met him 
recently, had categorically stated that what Ms. Raphel was 
saying was not the right line. He even quoted the US Charge 
D'affairs in New Delhi as having taken this position in one of 
these meetings. 
  Mr. Chavan claimed that the United Kingdom also did not 
agree 
with the US line and based his claim on what was told to him by 
an unnamed UK Minister. 
  The Home Minister said there was a qualitative improvement 
in 
Kashmir especially after the peaceful resolution of the 
Hazratbal standoff. Pakistan was no longer getting the sort of 
the peoples sympathy it used to earlier, he said. 
  Mr. Chavan said it was a "delicate national issue," and 
appealed to all sections and political parties to exercise 
restraint in their utterances on the topic. 
  Mr. Chavan said the government had an open mind in 
discussing 
Kashmir. "We have to take everybody along" in finding a solution. 
  He said it was wrong to describe the perpetrators of 
violence 
in Kashmir as "militants." They are "terrorists, nothing less," 
he added. 
  Mr. Chavan regretted the references during the debate to the 
so-called differences between Jawaharlah Nehru and Sardar Patel 
over the approach to Kashmir issue. They were tall and great 
leaders and worked together to create and build an independent 
India. There was absolutely nothing surprising if they had 
differences of perception, if at all, on certain issues, he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Mr. Chavan Talks Tough"] </F>
  [Text] Mr. S.B. Chavan's broadside against the United 
States in the Lok Sabha, which paid little heed to diplomatic 
niceties, marks a new assertiveness in India's Kashmir policy. 
But it also points to the lamentable gulf that seems to separate 
India from America these days. By charging the U.S. with seeking 
gains for itself in Kashmir, the home minister seems to have 
virtually accused it of harbouring covetous designs on Indian 
territory. Even otherwise, the tone of his utterances and the 
fact that they follow the parliamentary resolution, reaffirming 
India's determination to maintain its sovereignty over the 
state, ought to send an unequivocal message to whoever has been 
taking an interest in the matter. The opposition, of course, 
cannot be faulted for criticising the government's handling of 
the state's affairs, given the prevailing lawlessness there and 
a feeling that other countries were being too casual about 
India's concerns. Indeed, given the peculiar circumstances in 
Kashmir at present, Parliament is, in a sense, its custodian. 
Fortunately, after a shaky beginning, the official policy seems 
to have been fleshed out with the governor, Gen. K.V. Krishna 
Rao, in command in Srinagar and the home minister spelling out 
the government's position with uncommon vigour in New Delhi. In 
advance of the outcome of the UNHRC [United Nations Human Rights 
Commission] in Geneva, the combative home minister has also 
given short shrift to charges of human rights violations by 
India in Kashmir. There is little doubt, therefore, that the 
situation is far clearer than it used to be not long ago. 
  While the home minister's remarks were not always taken all 
that seriously in the past, his latest observations on the U.S. 
and Pakistan undoubtedly represent a new and 
carefully-structured position of the government. The latter 
apparently wants to make it quite clear, in the light of various 
suggestions emanating from Washington, that New Delhi will take 
serious exception to measures that seek to question India's 
sovereign rights over Kashmir. Perhaps the forthcoming visit of 
the top American official dealing with South Asia, Ms. Robin 
Raphel, lent an edge to Mr. Chavan's comments. Unlike some 
people, Mr. Chavan has not shied away from charging that Ms. 
Raphel's statement, questioning the accession of Kashmir to the 
Indian Union, had the sanction of the U.S. President, Mr. Bill 
Clinton. The Indian officials dealing with the U.S., who have 
been trying to keep the relations between the two countries on 
an even keel despite the severe buffeting they have received, 
may detect a positive element in Mr. Chavan's observation that 
India must "find out what exactly are the intentions of the U.S. 
government". But, as home minister, Mr. Chavan has also to deal 
with the seamier side of international politics, namely, 
espionage, cross-border sabotage and proxy wars. So it is not 
surprising, especially in the context of Kashmir, that his 
remarks were sharp, without any mitigating element one normally 
expects in any reference to a country with which there is no 
direct confrontation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Bold Stand Against US"; all quotation marks </F>
as published] 
  [Text] Is Robin Raphel a resident of India? Or, is she a 
spokesperson for Pakistani terrorists? One cannot but help 
entertain such doubts going by the authoritative, often 
contradictory, statements issued by her. It is totally 
unbecoming of a representative of the world's most powerful 
country to ape Jack Nicholson, the Joker. Ms. Raphel, by her 
intemperate and totally immature utterances is playing havoc 
with the destinies of millions of citizens in the subcontinent. 
Ms. Raphel feels that a "lot of human rights abuses are still 
occurring in Kashmir both on the part of the militants and the 
security forces. While recent steps by the Government of India 
had increased accountability, the improvement has yet to be 
reflected on the ground". Her concern for human rights is most 
touching. We too feel concerned at the impunity with which human 
rights violations take place in the so-called land of global 
democrats, the United States of America. Ms. Raphel's obsession 
with matters Asian seem to preclude her understanding of naked 
home truths. The Human Rights Watch, an American human rights 
organisation, rapped in its report recently the United States 
for `non-compliance' with the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR). The report, a joint undertaking of 
the major US Constitutional Rights Organisation and the largest 
US-based international human rights group, regularly quoted by 
the state department when it criticises other countries, was 
prompted by the ratification of the ICCPR by the US in 1992, 25 
years after its adoption by the United Nations. The Human Rights 
Watch executive director, Mr. Kenneth Roth, had this to say: 
"The US government regularly condemns human rights abuses in 
other countries, but has done little to apply international 
human rights law in the country. We issue this report in the 
hope of breaking the cynical view of international human rights 
law as a source of protection only for those outside the US 
borders. This report demonstrates that violations are happening 
on the US soil as well". 
  The report identified nine substantive areas in which the US 
`falls short of international standards'. For the benign 
education of Ms. Raphel, some of the sticking points of the 
report are: the US routinely violates Article 10 of the ICCPR 
which requires that all prisoners and detainees be treated with 
humanity and respect to the inherent dignity of the human 
person; Article 10 is also violated by many of the techniques 
and punishments of `super-maximum security' facilities where for 
example, prisoners may pass years without breathing outside air 
or may be forced to eat their meals like a dog, with hands tied 
behind their backs; the anti-discrimination requirement of 
Article 26 is violated by the unequal treatment of women 
prisoners, who receive fewer recreational, vocational and 
educational opportunities than their male counterparts; although 
US legal protection against race discrimination is generally 
adequate by ICCPR standards, in practice legal safeguards go 
largely ignored. Educational segregation and unequal conditions 
of schooling persist. Public and private housing are rife with 
segregation and discrimination. The report says that it finds 
"significant shortcomings in the US record, from the summary 
repatriation of Haitian Boat People (refugees fleeing to the US 
from Haiti in leaking boats) to the brutal treatment of 
prisoners in the US". So much for Ms. Raphel's concern for human 
rights! If the Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia has 
been making a spectacle of herself, the contribution to such 
humour has been quite significant from India's leadership. We 
have been defensive all through. Any Tom, Dick and Harry can 
level accusations against India and get away with it. All that 
we seem to do is defend, defend and defend. The inability of the 
foreign policy makers to come out of cocooned non-alignment 
thinking, and their inability to define India's self-interest 
clearly has led even terrorist exporting countries like Pakistan 
and habitual offenders of human rights like Iran to mouthings on 
human rights. Recognition of this fact, belated though, has come 
in the form of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's bold statement to 
recast India's defence policy if Pressler Amendment is dropped 
against Pakistan. Only the naive and ignorant will be fooled by 
the US stand that a one-time waiver of Pressler Amendment is not 
harmful. For the United States, the bottomline of Lockheed 
Corporation manufacturing the dreaded F-16s is more important 
than the welfare of India, Pakistan or its one billion humans. 
That is the truth, fair and simple.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal; all quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 14--The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today urged friends of Pakistan--an obvious 
reference to the United States, among others--to persuade 
Islamabad to be responsive to India's approach for normalising 
and building up bilateral relations. The Pakistan Prime 
Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, had heightened the anti-India 
rhetoric to unprecedented levels on Kashmir which, naturally, 
aim in the way of dialogue he said. 
  Mr. Rao underscored the futility of this course, for 
eventually she would have to come to the negotiation table. Her 
own father had signed the Shimla agreement and someone had to 
tell her, according to Mr. Rao, to adhere to it. 
  The Prime Minister made these points in a conversation with 
the visiting U.S. Senator, Mr. Daniel Patrick Moynihan who said 
he would convey these views to his President, Mr. Bill Clinton. 
Mr. Moynihan gave a similar assurance when Mr. Rao stressed the 
urgency of all out efforts to end the Bosnia crisis which was 
fuelling the fires of Muslim fundamentalism all over the world. 
  The current state of Indo-Pakistan--and also 
Indo-U.S.--relations figured at length at the meeting the Prime 
Minister had with Mr. Moynihan who is the chairman of the U.S. 
Senate Panel on South Asia and a former Ambassador to India. 
<H5>  Framework Exists </H5>
  Mr. Moynihan, who sought the Prime Minister's views on 
Indo-Pakistan ties, was told that a framework of dialogue 
between the two countries already existed in the form of the 
Shimla Agreement. India, according to Mr. Rao, had offered to 
continue talks for good-neighbourly relations but Pakistan's 
actions in continuing its support to terrorism in Jammu and 
Kashmir and its world-wide anti-India propaganda were major 
barriers. According to Mr. Moynihan, the United States continued 
to favour the Shimla Agreement framework for Indo-Pakistan talks. 
  The present rhetoric was not going to help Pakistan, said 
Mr. 
Rao. Unless Islamabad jettisoned the Shimla framework there was 
no justification for its leaders to go from place to place. "I 
am a serious-minded person. I do not want to indulge in 
rhetoric. It would be waste of time and energy and would 
encourage tension," Mr. Rao said. 
<H5>  `Strange' </H5>
  It was strange, according to the Prime Minister, that India 
should be blamed for human rights violation when it had an 
independent judiciary, free press, and democratic system--and 
now a human rights commission to probe cases of excesses. Mr. 
Moynihan remarked: "You have my sympathies and respect." 
  Regarding Indo-U.S. relations, they discussed both the 
positive and the negative aspects in the bilateral field. Mr. 
Moynihan was happy at the growth of economic ties, as evidenced 
by the level of U.S. investments in India last year, which was 
higher than that of the previous 40 years. He expressed 
satisfaction at the progress of the economic liberalisation 
programme in India. 
<H5>  `We don't have bomb' </H5>
  As the discussion turned to nuclear non-proliferation, Mr. 
Rao assured Mr. Moynihan that India did not have a bomb and 
therefore there was no question of dismantling it. If they 
(Pakistan) have it they should dismantle it, he said. 
  Mr. Rao's reference to "friends of Pakistan" was obviously 
intended to be a hint to the United States to try to restrain 
Pakistan from pursuing its no-holds-barred anti-India campaign. 
In the immediate context, it could mean persuading Pakistan to 
continue the dialogue begun last month at the level of Foreign 
Secretaries on the basis of the six Indian proposals, regarded 
as positive by Washington, instead of using the international 
for anti-India tirades. 
  As a matter of fact, the Pakistan Foreign Secretary, Mr. 
Shahryar Khan, was now in Washington--obviously to seek U.S. 
support to his Government's move to use the U.N. Human Rights 
Commission for an anti-India campaign. This could be an 
appropriate occasion for the United States, if it so wanted, to 
counsel Pakistan against recklessness. 
  Mr. Moynihan's visit here comes in the wake of the Senate 
panel's hearings where the Clinton Administration's policy on 
South Asia and the style of the Assistant Secretary of State, 
Ms. Robin Raphel--the cause of extreme disquiet here--were 
sharply criticised. Mr. Moynihan strongly defended India on the 
human rights issue, saying that its Constitution provided firm 
guarantees of individual freedom and its record since 1947 was 
impeccable. This was followed by a warning about the futility of 
mechanical application of the standards of civil liberties to 
situations of ethnic conflicts.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Viswam: "PM: It's for Pak to Respond"] </F>
  [Text] London, March 14: The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, on Monday assured his British counterpart, Mr. 
John Major, that the groundwork for the resumption of the 
political process in Jammu and Kashmir had already been taken in 
hand. 
  In the context of the need for restoration of normality in 
Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Rao also conveyed to Mr. Major India's 
readiness to enter into a dialogue with Pakistan, emphasising at 
the same time that the responsibility for responding to Indian 
initiatives in this respect lay solely with Pakistan. The Prime 
Minister's assurances came in response to a specific enquiry 
from Mr. Major as to the current steps towards resumption of the 
political process in Kashmir as well as of an Indo-Pakistan 
dialogue. 
  During an exchange of views at a summit meeting between the 
two Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street, both Punjab and Kashmir 
figured in the discussions which were described as frank and 
cordial. After the meeting, while Mr. Major said that the two of 
them had a "good meeting," Mr. Rao smiled and nodded 
acknowledgement as if to say that he concurred with Mr. Major's 
assessment of the outcome. 
  Mr. Rao told the British Prime Minister that while the 
Indian 
interest in holding elections in Kashmir was both keen and 
earnest, he was sceptical about the success of Indian efforts so 
long as the "fear of the gun," namely instigation from across 
the borders persisted. However, he reminded Mr. Major that the 
Indian efforts in Punjab had succeeded and that the State was 
now peaceful and democracy functioned there effectively. The 
Prime Minister also secured a positive response from Mr. Major 
to his suggestion that Britain consider enhancing significantly 
its size of investments in India. 
  Mr. Rao stressed that there was need for the international 
community to resolve issues like Bosnia where forces of 
extremism were being invoked, with consequential repercussions 
around the world. 
  The exchange of views at the delegation-level lasted about 
half-an-hour after which the two Prime Ministers went into a 
one-to-one session without aides. According to the Foreign 
Secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, the outcome of the talks was on 
the positive and constructive side. 
  Specifically in respect of India's initiatives to bring 
Pakistan to the negotiating table, Mr. Rao pointed out that 
India had recently offered to Pakistan six proposals for 
initiating a dialogue. He emphasised that India was persistently 
trying for a constructive dialogue with Pakistan. This argument 
was cited by Mr. Rao while responding to Mr. Major's query as to 
whether it was possible to set in place some confidence building 
measures with Pakistan. The implication of Mr. Rao's response 
was that such confidence building measures had already been 
thought upon by India, and the ball was now in Islamabad's court. 
  The two Prime Ministers expressed appreciation of the 
success 
of Indo-British partnership initiatives which had been agreed 
upon by the private sector of the two countries. 
  The continuation of the partnership was endorsed by the two 
Prime Ministers both of whom were appreciative of the fact that 
the "wicket is full of runs." Responding with a similar cricket 
allusion, his British counterpart said that IBPI [Indo-British 
Partnership Initiative] had had a good innings and that they 
were still at the crease. [sentence as published] 
  Britain is opposed to the "internationalisation" of the 
Kashmir issue and strongly supports India's stand that the 
problem should be resolved through bilateral talks between New 
Delhi and Islamabad under the Shimla agreement. 
  Referring to the controversial resolution on Kashmir moved 
and later withdrawn by Pakistan at the recent United Nations 
Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) meeting in Geneva, the sources 
said the spokesman of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had 
clearly stated that Britain did not believe that such 
resolutions were helpful in finding a solution. 
  On human rights in Kashmir, the sources said there had been 
a 
willingness on the part of the British government to recognise 
that there had been "much exaggeration" in reports criticising 
India on the issue. The British leadership agreed with India's 
view that "many abuses in Kashmir are committed by militants" 
and that New Delhi had a democratic tradition, independent 
judiciary, free press and a number of local and national human 
rights organisations, which zealously worked for the protection 
of human rights.

<F P=106> [Article by L.K. Sharma: "Pack on Bilateral Investments: Rao </F>
for Global Pressure on Pakistan"] 
  [Excerpts] London, March 14. India's growing impatience 
with Pakistan's role in Kashmir and its tactics at international 
forums was reflected here in the statements of the Prime 
Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao. He reiterated his government's 
determination to achieve normalisation in that state through a 
democratic, political and consensual approach. 
  (Britain today announced a \Pten million assistance for the 
World Bank rehabilitation projects in the quake hit areas of 
Maharashtra, report UNI [United News of India] and PTI [Press 
Trust of India]. 
  This would be in addition to the \Pthree million assistance 
already given by Britain for the purpose. 
  The British overseas development minister, Baroness Lynda 
Chalker, conveyed this decision when she called on Mr. Narasimha 
Rao here this morning. 
  Expressing appreciation for British development assistance 
to 
India, the Prime Minister reiterated New Delhi's commitment to 
economic reforms. 
  He said his government would pay special attention to the 
weaker sections of the society while initiating development 
programmes. 
  Mr. Rao said India would welcome assistance in the 
infrastructural sector particularly in the field of energy. 
  New Delhi is the largest recipient of British overseas 
assistance for 1993-94. The UK had pledged \P239 million to 
India during the period. 
  Later in his meeting with the secretary of defence, Mr. 
Malcolm Rifkind, Mr. Rao stressed the need for greater 
technology transfer as also co-production, sub contract and 
joint marketing in the defence sector. 
  The leaders in their 30-minute meeting discussed ways and 
means to increase defence cooperation between India and Britain. 
  Earlier in the morning Mr. Rao had a breakfast meeting with 
the Mayor of London. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Rao's message to his host government as well as to the 
Indian community was more or less the same. He highlighted 
Pakistan's role in helping terrorists and described Kashmir as 
"another victim of a proxy war directed against India." 
  Addressing the community at Guild Hall, Mr. Rao said 
terrorism in Kashmir sought to destroy India's sense of 
nationhood, secularism and democracy. Misguided youths 
indoctrinated, and equipped with instruments of violence from 
outside were engaged in mindless violence. It was not a 
religious problem and if the external factor was removed from 
Jammu and Kashmir, the state could return to normalcy, hold 
elections and revive economic activity. 
  "The world must recognise that it is this external factor of 
Pakistan's instigation which keeps alive terrorist activity in 
Kashmir. The only intervention that is needed is pressure on 
that external factor to cease such support and enter into 
serious discussions with us on a peaceful and durable 
understanding. We have shown ourselves to be open to such a 
dialogue in spite of the provocative and unreasonable attitude 
of our neighbours, and will continue to remain so. 
  He reminded the world of the amusing irony that a country on 
the verge of being declared a terrorist state should be able to 
loftily proclaim that they could not have discussions with us 
until our human rights record improved. It was because of a 
massive disinformation campaign that India, a victim of 
terrorism organised and financed from across the border, should 
sometimes find itself subjected to unwarranted criticism. It 
also found that the world was worried about the human rights of 
terrorists, who massacred innocent people or used religious 
places for political ends, but not of those who were being 
forced out of their homes, attacked and terrorised. 
  Mr. Rao recalled that Punjab, after a decade-long nightmare 
of terrorist violence, had been turned into a peaceful state. 
The transformation was made possible by the patriotism of the 
people of Punjab and their faith in democracy. "Their fortitude 
and determination in the face of terrorism would be a remarkable 
chapter in India's post independence history," he added. 
  Mr. Rao said India remained fully committed to secularism 
while fully respecting all religions. Over the centuries, 
minorities in India had enriched the mosaic of India's 
multicultural heritage, he said. 
  India's economic reforms was another subject on which Mr. 
Rao 
addressed the Non-Resident Indians [NRI]. Mr. Rao said the 
economic situation had improved tremendously. Foreign 
investments had grown and there was a further role for NRIs who 
would find investments in India very attractive. 
  India had taken several measures to remove difficulties of 
businessmen and the state governments were competing with each 
other for NRI investments. The NRI community was the second 
largest investor in India in 1993, going by approval figures, 
Mr. Rao said. The NRI community in Britain also had a role in 
shaping the Indo-British relationship which had reached a very 
exciting phase, he said.

  [Text] London, March 14 (UNI [United News of India]): India 
and Britain on Monday added a new dimension to their economic 
relations by signing an agreement on promotion and protection of 
investments from each other's country. 
  The agreement was signed by the British Foreign Secretary, 
Mr. Douglas Hurd, and the Indian High Commissioner to Britain, 
Mr. L.M. Singhvi at 10, Downing Street, in the presence of the 
Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and his British 
counterpart, Mr. John Major. 
  Britain is the first country with which India has signed 
such 
an agreement, aimed at creating conditions conducive for 
investments in each other's country and designed to increase 
investor confidence. Protection of a wide range of investments, 
including moveable and immoveable property, mortgages, liens, 
pledges, shares and stocks and intellectual property rights is 
covered by the agreement. 
  An official spokesman for the Indian delegation said the 
central idea behind the agreement was that each of the 
contracting parties would ensure fair and equitable treatment as 
well as full protection and security to investments from the 
other country. 
  He said that initially, the agreement would remain in force 
for a period of 10 years. Thereafter, it could be terminated if 
either contracting party gave notice of termination to the other. 
  If such a step is taken, it would be on a non-discriminatory 
basis and would entail fair and equitable compensation to the 
affected investor. 
  Article 5 and 6 of the agreement guarantee that investments 
of investors of either contracting party shall not be 
nationalised or expropriated except for certain public purposes 
related to the internal requirements for regulating economic 
activity. 
  Moreover, the investor would also have a right to review by 
a 
judicial or another independent authority of the contracting 
party. Investors, whose investments suffer due to war, other 
armed conflicts, national emergency or civil disturbances are 
guaranteed of a treatment as regard compensation which would not 
be less favourable than which the contracting party accords to 
its own investors or the investors of any third State. 
  Several dispute resolution mechanisms are dealt with 
including amicable settlements through direct negotiations 
between the parties to the dispute, international reconciliation 
under the conciliation rule of the United Nations Commission on 
International Trade Law, and recourse to be international centre 
for settlement of the disputes.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 14 (UNI [United News of India]): 
The Supreme Court has expressed the view that any party or 
organisation fighting elections on a plank with proximate effect 
of eroding the Constitution's secular philosophy would be guilty 
of following an unconstitutional action. 
  In their separate judgment while disposing of the appeals 
filed by various parties in connection with the dismissal of 
State governments and dissolution of Assemblies last week, Mr. 
Justice S.C. Agrawal and Mr. Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy said a 
religious or cultural body did not aim at acquiring State power 
unlike a political party which is formed to capture or share 
State power. They might be associations of individuals, but 
their functional relevance--acquiring State power--could not be 
ignored. 
  They said political parties were an integral to the 
governance of a democratic society. If the Constitution required 
the State to be secular, the same requirement was attached to 
political parties. The Constitution did not permit mixing 
religion and State power which must be kept apart. 
  They said religion was an impermissible element in the body 
politic and an imbalance in the constitutional system. If a 
party espousing a particular religion came to power, that 
religion tended to become the official religion and all other 
religions would come to acquire a secondary status or enjoy a 
less favourable position which would be antithetical to Articles 
14 to 16, 25 and other provisions of the Constitution. 
  The judges said if a party, by word of mouth, print or in 
other manner created the impression of its being a political and 
a religious party it would be guilty of unconstitutionality and 
have no right to function as a political party. The fact that a 
party might be entitled to go to the people seeking a mandate 
for a drastic amendment of the Constitution or by its 
replacement by another was wholly irrelevant in the context. 
  "We do not know how the Constitution can be amended so as to 
remove secularism from the basic structure of the Constitution 
(as defined in the Keshavananda Bharti case)," they said. "Nor 
do we know how the present Constitution can be replaced by 
another.... It does not provide for its own demise." 
  The judges alluded to the provisions of the Representation 
of 
People Act (RPA) and said even a single instance of the use of 
religious symbols or an appeal to the electorate to vote on the 
basis of religion, race, caste or community was enough to 
vitiate the election of a candidate. The Act also provided for 
parties to affirm their faith and allegiance to the principles 
of socialism, secularism and democracy. 
  Mr. Justice K. Raniaswaniy, in his judgement, observed that 
the rise of fundamentalism and communalisation of politics was 
anti-secular and encouraged separatist and divisive forces which 
became breeding grounds for national disintegration. 
  He said it was the duty of the court to interpret the 
Constitution to bring political parties within the purview of 
constitutional parameters for accountability.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mehdi Rouhani, spiritual leader of Shiites </F>
in Europe, by Hassan Murtada, in Cologne, Bonn; date not given: 
"Settling of Scores Between Shiites and Sunnis"--first paragraph 
AL-HAWADITH introduction] 
  [Text] After a talk delivered in the British House of 
Commons, Ayatollah Mehdi Rouhani went to Germany to lecture on 
religious affairs in his capacity as spiritual head of Shiites 
in Europe. In Cologne, AL-HAWADITH interviewed him about 
developments in the Iranian situation, following the events of 
Zahedan, the attempted assassination of President Rafsanjani, 
and about his position as a religious personage from Qom. He 
answered the questions, and expects difficult times for Iran, 
because of an unprecedented economic crisis that is hitting the 
poor classes and causing them to take to the streets. The 
interview with Ayatollah Rouhani continued in Bonn, which is the 
last stop on his tour. He did not want to go into questions of 
religious authority, perhaps because one of his two brothers, 
Mohammad Rouhani, is a religious scholar in Qom, who has his 
adherents and students. Through the tape of the interview, which 
runs more than two hours, a true picture emerges of the many 
Iranian difficulties. 
  [Murtada] What precisely happened in the city of Zahedan? 
Why 
the eruption? Is there any connection between this security 
convulsion and the assassination attempt against President 
Rafsanjani? Is overburdened Iran on the eve of a 
counterrevolution? 
  [Rouhani] What occurred in Zahedan was a settling of scores 
between Sunnis and Shiites. The spark came at a border post with 
Pakistan, when a Revolution Guard member killed a Sunni 
clergyman on grounds that he had committed the crime of murder 
and fled to Rawalpindi. He was allowed no defense and the matter 
was dubious. The city's Sunnis became agitated; their movement 
was led by the son of the slain clergyman, Abdollah Shahinjashr. 
The regular forces intervened and supported the Shiites, who 
live in nearby Zabol. Matters developed and took on sectarian 
dimensions, since the Shiites of Zabol opposed the Sunnis of 
Zahedan. Revolution Guard units were immediately dispatched to 
restore order in Zahedan and put down the uprising. Many of 
their personnel were killed. 
  Undoubtedly, the inhabitants were in a state of rebellion 
against the regime, which relies on weapons to impose its 
control. In the midst of this hubbub, President Rafsanjani was 
shot at. The attempt was one of a series and was not the first. 
The shooter was an officer of the Revolution Guard. He was not 
alone. About 50 suspects have been arrested on suspicion in that 
operation. 
  Behind the events at home, Rafsanjani--at Friday prayers in 
Tehran University--said that the Americans and Israelis wanted 
to kill him. Security forces were deployed on a vast scale in 
many cities. Minister of Intelligence and Security, 'Ali 
Fallahian, personally took charge of the investigations into the 
assassination attempt against Rafsanjani. Besides Zahedan, there 
are at least three cities with a majority of Sunnis, whose 
inhabitants hate the regime. The most important of these cities, 
in addition to Zahedan, are the capital of the southern 
Baluchestan region, Hashtbar on the Caspian Sea, and Gonbd-e 
Kavus, near the border with Turkmenistan. Security forces, Basij 
(volunteers from among the oppressed), and Revolution Guard 
elements were deployed to suppress what appeared to be a Sunni 
intifadah against the Tehran regime. 
  [Murtada] Are the Sunnis in Iran capable of convulsing the 
regime, which is controlled by Shiites? 
  [Rouhani] Government estimates put the number of Iranian 
Sunnis at 7 million, i.e., 12 percent of the total population of 
59 million. Sunnis live in the Baluchestan area, where they are 
the majority; the plains of Gorgan, on the border with 
Turkmenistan; and some areas of Gilan on the Caspian Sea, 
neighboring Azarbaijan. Iranian Kurds are Sunni, as are the 
Arabs in the oil-rich Khozestan region. The state's strategy is 
to prevent the rise of any Sunni to high office in the 
administration or governmental pyramid, as well as the Armed 
Forces, Revolution Guard, and state organizations. Sunni areas 
are generally poor. Their educational and social levels have 
been low since the Shah's time and have continued that way since 
Khomeyni. There are feelings of rebellion against the regime and 
its organizations, especially in light of attempts to force 
Sunnis to embrace Shiism and the Twelver School. 
  The Iranian Constitution, whose drafting was supervised by 
Khomeyni himself, envisions no role for minorities in Iran. It 
asserts that Iran is a Shiite state, of the Ja'afari school. In 
1979, a clause in this Constitution protecting the rights and 
private affairs of minorities was rejected. It was declared that 
Islam is the religion of the generality of the nation. It is no 
coincidence that we see widespread Sunni solidarity with Zahedan. 
  [Murtada] However, Arab and foreign observers think that the 
degeneration of the Iranian situation in general, and the 
Zahedan uprising in particular, can be attributed to difficult 
living conditions and the collapse of the Iranian rial exchange 
rate vis-a-vis the dollar. 
  [Rouhani] Living conditions are extremely difficult. They 
are 
the fuse for the explosions and acts of unrest in many cities. 
The middle classes are ground down by high prices. When 
President Rafsanjani tried to abolish the government subsidy on 
certain commodities, in accordance with the instructions from 
the International Bank, Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i was 
opposed. All of this coincides with a population explosion, 
inflation, and foreign debts, which have reached $30 billion. 
The amount spent on armament is unknown, but it is in the 
neighborhood of 4 billion [dollars] annually. All of these 
reasons result in semi-daily disturbances, which the regime 
controls by arms. However, it is unable to deal with the 
underlying causes. 
  [Murtada] Has the crisis over Marja'iat [Supreme Source of 
Emulation] in Iran ended? Can the supreme leader, Khamene'i, 
become the Supreme Marja'? 
  [Rouhani] In previous sermons, Ali Khamene'i has stated he 
is 
a moqalled [emulator] himself, not a Marja'. The rank of a 
Marja' requires at least 30 years of practice in teaching and 
writing books before one becomes the Supreme Marja'. From this 
perspective, it is impossible for Khamene'i to become the 
Marja', especially since he does not fulfill these conditions. 
  [Murtada] Is Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah in Beirut, who is 
knowledgeable and spiritually influential, entitled to become 
the Marja'? Would it be incumbent upon him, therefore, to leave 
the southern suburb, in order to settle in Qom? 
  [Rouhani] Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah studied under the Grand 
Ayatollah Mohammad Rouhani, who is my brother. He is considered 
a supreme Marja' now. He now lives in the holy city of Qom, 
which was his birthplace. Fadlallah is not entitled to be a 
supreme Marja', so long as his teacher is alive, and he is the 
Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Rouhani. 
  [Murtada] What developments do you expect on the domestic 
political scene following the Zahedan incidents? 
  [Rouhani] Generally, the situation is unstable; disturbances 
occur each day. Groups rise up against the regime. Killings 
happen, and citizens are detained. From this perspective, Iran 
is atop a volcano. I see a civil war coming in two or three 
years. This is what the West doesn't understand. The 
socioeconomic situation is difficult. Unemployment is a time 
bomb, because it affects more than half the labor force. The 
government cannot do anything with regard to the situation. 
  In the Shah's days, Iran's oil profits were about $50 
billion 
each year. The Shah ruled Iran for 37 years and came to power 12 
years before Mosadeq, i.e., 1320H in the Iranian solar calendar 
(1941). Mosadeq fell in 1333H (1953). The Shah continued in 
power for 25 years after Mosadeq. During his reign, oil profits 
were in the range of $50 billion per year. Iran's population was 
around 35 million. Today, oil profits are $12 billion a year, 
while the population is around $60 million. In addition to this 
large gap, wealth, capitalists, and experts have fled abroad. 
Major factories are either destroyed, or their owners have taken 
their funds to the West. The country went through eight years of 
war. I should mention that Rafsanjani revealed dreadful numbers 
after the war. He said that 25,000 cities, towns, and hamlets 
were destroyed with, at least, one-half million persons killed. 
Now, their families are a burden on the state. This government 
does not inspire confidence. It vacillates before problems that 
remain unsolved. 
  I am a proponent of the dollar model. In the Shah's time, 
for 
example, I did not praise it. Everyone knows that I opposed it. 
The dollar was equal to six tomans while, today, it is the 
equivalent of 150 tomans. This is a large disparity in the rate 
of exchange, and means the state's economic structure is in 
ruins. In these circumstances, no one trusts the regime that has 
gotten us into indebtedness to the choking point, with all the 
debt services and commitments. 
  [Murtada] But, President Rafsanjani has showered promises to 
reform the situation on more than one occasion. 
  [Rouhani] In my view, even if Rafsanjani wanted to do 
anything, he could not because, first, he doesn't know the 
mechanisms of the economy, nor does anyone in the government at 
this difficult and complex stage. Naturally, he can call for 
assistance from men of expertise and competence in the economic 
and political arena, but he does not trust them. In general, the 
regime does not trust Iranians abroad. Usually, they are 
specialists. Today we have about 100,000 specialists abroad. 
There are around 3 million exiles. Unfortunately, these capable 
people are absent from Iran, living in Europe or the United 
States. They don't trust the regime enough to return. Those who 
dared to return were unable to do anything. So they packed their 
bags and left the country again. They did not feel secure or 
safe. The regime did not inspire them with confidence. Moreover, 
the suspicion was mutual, and the upshot was Iran lost its 
capabilities. 
  [Murtada] These days, many are talking about the second 
five-year plan to boost the country's economy. 
  [Rouhani] Iranian five-year plans are pretty on paper; 
implementation is another story. The government has been 
incapable of applying what it plans for the last 15 years. The 
next month is worse than the last month. The past is prettier 
than the present. Today, we cannot say that Iran's situation in 
various fields and areas is better then yesterday. The entire 
regime is in a critical predicament, and its important men and 
prominent figures know that better than anyone else. 
  [Murtada] In that case, how do you explain the arms 
expenditure. Is it unreal in any way? Why guns before bread and 
at its expense, as it appears from your reading of the situation? 
  [Rouhani] The Shah's regime did not respect the citizens' 
freedom and gave not a fig for them. It feared foreigners, and 
the present regime is maintaining this shahinshah principle. It 
attaches no importance either to human rights, or to the United 
Nations, the so-called international community. The arms 
expenditures benefit a million armed men who protect the regime. 
The regular army numbers one-half million; the Pasdaran about 
300,000; and the rest, i.e., 200,000, are police, security 
personnel, and secret police. This million forms the regime's 
power, and its financial weight pours into their palms. The 
regime's goal is to satisfy these elements and comply with their 
needs. There is a wall between the people and the regime. By 
chance, I asked one of my relatives who lives in Qom to bring me 
some Iranian bread, which we call "Sangak." It is good bread. I 
tell you that I cannot eat just one bite of it. It is black and 
flavorful. No one knows what it is made of. This bitter bread is 
eaten by 40 million Iranians. They eat it with cheese and milk. 
This is the life of Iranians today. The people are in mourning 
today, wandering aimlessly in misery. They are suffering from 
difficulties that appear impossible to solve. 
  [Murtada] Do the president and the leader, that is 
Rafsanjani 
and Khamene'i, form one team, or does each one play his 
political game within the power structure? Are differences a 
natural occurrence, or are conflicts concealed? 
  [Rouhani] Contrary to what some say regarding disputes and 
differences between the two men, although their points of view 
are different, I believe that they coalesce and are in accord. I 
have learned that in a recent leadership meeting in Tehran, 
Khamene'i called for alliance with Iraq, because it opposes the 
Americans and the West in general. In contrast, Rafsanjani 
called for openness to the West. However, the different 
viewpoint does not mean that the two men are quarreling. Each 
one has his opinion but, in the end, there will be complete and 
total agreement between them. Disagreement might lie in 
distribution of roles. Rafsanjani always concentrates in his 
speeches on the importance of relations with the West in order 
to safeguard the regime, while Khamene'i sees the opposite. He 
looks for reasons for the regime to stay in alliance with the 
weak, with states outside the West's influence. However, the two 
do agree on the principle of division of power. One is president 
of the republic; the other is leader of the revolution. The 
regime is based on the principle of division. 
  [Murtada] Where do "conciliation" efforts between Washington 
and Tehran stand? Why hasn't normalization occurred, despite 
Rafsanjani's desire for normal relations? Why hasn't the West 
supported his efforts, so long as he is a counter-revolutionary 
Trotsky? Is it true that Washington considers him a part of the 
regime that it cannot trust in whole or part? 
  [Rouhani] The readings and analyses vary in this regard. I 
am 
sure that the Americans do not trust the Iranian regime, nor its 
leading figures. Therefore, they ignore it, although they have 
not granted it a respite. It seems to me from meetings with 
Western officials that they are in no hurry to have normal 
relations with the Iranian regime. They will impose their 
conditions. The matter is no longer as it was in the past, 
during the time of the Soviet Union and the dual polarization. 
They are letting the Iranian regime chase after their heels and 
not the reverse. Khamene'i's anti-American slogans are mere 
words for internal consumption. In any event, the record is worn 
out. No one listens anymore, even those who once believed in its 
content. 
  [Murtada] Is there any close relationship between you and 
the 
spokesman for the Supreme National Security Council, Hasan 
Rouhani? 
  [Rouhani] There is no close relationship. Hasan Rouhani is 
from Semnan; I am from Qom. His father is a religious scholar, 
and he is also a religious scholar. His surname is "Alemi." He 
is the official spokesman for the Supreme National Security 
Council, which has 12 members, including Khamene'i, Rafsanjani, 
the Ministers of Interior and Security, and Ahmad Khomeyni. It 
is the highest political-military power in Iran and makes the 
major decisions on all levels. 
  [Murtada] How could the situation develop in Iran in the 
near 
future, in light of the Zahedan challenges? 
  [Rouhani] The situation might go from bad to worse. The 
regime is off balance and unstable. 
  [Murtada] What is the alternative to the regime? The 
domestic 
opposition? The Abol-Hasan Bani Sadr wing in the regime? 
  [Rouhani] The alternative might be a moderate Islamic 
regime, 
not the Islam that the present regime espouses. I mean a regime 
that respects principles of Islamic justice and freedom. One 
cannot offer hypotheses in this regard. The alternative is a 
regime composed of a supreme council, whose strength is 400 or 
500 persons. This council elects a nucleus of 10 to 12 persons 
to rule the country. Free elections should then follow. 
Everything depends on the people's free choice and 
consciousness. They want tangible results. 
  I am one who calls for free elections. This means finally 
turning the page of the Valay-e Faqih [Supreme Jurisprudent]. As 
a jurist, I believe that Vali-ye Faqih is not a religious 
principle, because it is a man's power over people. For example, 
how can a religious scholar who knows nothing about arms, 
military strategies, and the tactics of complex modern warfare, 
presume to build an army and determine its type of weaponry, in 
addition to its training? The same question also pertains to the 
economic structure. It is very complex and delicate. The 
cultural structure is no less complex for its part. Are 
financial issues simple? I believe that Velayat-e faqih died 
with Khomeyni and his legacy has been replaced by Vali-ye Amr 
[Guardian of the Muslim Cause], i.e., the ruler or sultan. 
Khamene'i, now, is Vali-ye Amr. As for the beiat [pledge of 
allegiance], that is claimed by Rafsanjani, the elected 
president. I think that all of this nomenclature touches the 
people's religious sensibilities and strives for religious 
legitimacy. The words and titles are pretty, but what is 
important is managing the country and the results achieved. 
  [Murtada] Why dissolve the regular army? Why have attempts 
been unsuccessful to merge it with the Revolution Guard forces? 
  [Rouhani] In a state like Iran, where all are subjects of 
Vali-ye Faqih and vali-ye Amr, there is no place for a regular 
army. These things must be done away with, before starting to 
rebuild regular military structures, seeking help from experts 
and technicians. The religious scholars should be excluded from 
this; they might be proficient in religious jurisprudence, but 
they don't know the requirements for a modern military 
structure. This separation is a must. 
  [Murtada] Who is the Shiites' supreme Marja' today, after 
the 
death of Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Reza Golpaygani? 
  [Rouhani] Grand Ayatollah Mohammad 'Ali Araki. He is over 
100 
years old. I know him personally, very well. I attended a study 
group with him, conducted by Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Khansari in 
Qom. Araki is a pious man, but he is reaching the end of his 
life, so that he no longer knows what is happening in Iran. One 
of my friends called on him last year to talk with him and get 
his views. My friend was astonished when Araki asked him about 
Imam Khomeyni's health. He believed that Araki didn't know that 
Khomeyni had been dead for five years. He apologized for the 
question. He said: "I didn't know that. May Khomeyni live with 
God in His Paradise." He was chosen the Shiites' supreme Marja' 
precisely because he doesn't know what's going on in the 
country, because there is the concern to maintain the regime, no 
matter the cost. Araki supports the Vali-ye Faqih, while others 
may reject it. 
  Now, every grand ayatollah is in Qom. There is no longer one 
in holy Najaf. It is impossible for Khamene'i to become the 
supreme Marja', because this selection depends on the people and 
their faith. According to the Constitution, Khamene'i is the 
effective head of state. He has the final word in all political 
matters. Rafsanjani, in fact, is head of the Cabinet, with the 
title of president of the republic. Today, he is less 
influential than he used to be. Once he was a trusted advisor, 
close to Khomeyni. I think that this is the basic reason for the 
West's indifference vis-a-vis Rafsanjani, and his attempts at a 
policy of openness toward it. He is being held back by radicals. 
  [Murtada] Why are Iranian-Gulf relations fluctuating warily, 
despite serious Gulf initiatives, based on a desire for good 
neighborliness. Then, the occupation of Abu Musa Island occurred 
to reveal an overt expansionism? 
  [Rouhani] I think the Gulf states do not trust the Iranian 
regime. A climate of confidence is basic in good-neighbor 
relations. When I refer to the government in Iran it occurs to 
me, in the first place, that firm relations ought to be 
established with Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states. I can 
well understand Gulf wariness vis-a-vis the Tehran regime and 
its flip-flops. Abu Musa compounded this situation and, 
unfortunately, caused alienation. Words alone will not eliminate 
the suspicion and distrust. 
  [Murtada] One last question. The Islamic Revolution came to 
power in 1979 and raised the slogan of just rule. Fifteen years 
later, we see that the abyss has deepened between the rich and 
the poor. That is what overthrew the Shah's regime. Does this 
gap, now, represent a main danger point against the ruling 
regime? Will history repeat itself, with another mark in Iran? 
  [Rouhani] Rafsanjani himself admitted that the gap is 
growing 
between the haves and the have-nots, between the wealthy and the 
poor, which was the crux of the demonstrations against the Shah. 
Now, class tensions are rising on the eve of the 16th year of 
the Iranian Revolution. I think that this gap is a major danger 
point for the regime which, as I expect, will be subjected to 
major tremors even before the end of President Rafsanjani's 
second term in three years. The president is a candidate to be 
eliminated, since he is not affiliated with a well-known 
religious family, as is the case with the leader, Ali Khamene'i, 
who is the son of Ayatollah Javad Khamene'i and the nephew of 
Shaykh Mohammad Khiabani, leader of the Tabriz revolt during the 
Constitutional Revolution in Iran. 
  Rafsanjani is from a small village called Bahreman in 
southern Iran. It is part of the city of Rafsanjan, in the 
Kerman Province. During the Shah's regime, he fled to Iraq and, 
then, to Syria and Lebanon, where he received assistance from 
Imam Musa al-Sadr. His wish was to transform the revolution into 
a state, but he immediately clashed with positions of power. As 
a result, he has backed off his project in favor of maintaining 
his seat in power. He is now completely in a semi-defensive 
condition. He has lost his gamble on economic reform. I am sure 
that his goal has been limited to continuing in power until the 
end of his term. He is no longer likely to introduce reforms 
into this situation, whose difficulties have apparently gone out 
of control, especially in light of the collapse of oil prices, 
the population numbers, the paucity of production, and the 
decline in the currency exchange rate. I see no light at the end 
of the tunnel. Unfortunately, bitter bread or "sangak" has 
become the first concern that keeps various classes of society 
sleepless, and makes them take to the streets.

<F P=106> [Article by Tawfiq Abu-Bakr (main editor), Ahmad Dawud </F>
(Amman), and Sami al-Masri (Nablus): "Decisionmaking Mechanism 
Took Shape Under Difficult Circumstances, Flabby Leadership 
Caused by Talents Staying Away"--first two paragraphs are 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT introduction] 
  [Text] This series of interviews and testimonies by 20 
Palestinian personalities with differing orientations aims to 
deepen understanding of the issues regarding the reform needed 
in the PLO's structure in order to build strong foundations for 
the coming national authority. It also aims at spreading fair, 
objective dialogue without charges and countercharges on the 
subject of democracy and pluralism in the period of transition 
from the age of revolution to the age of statehood. 
  The reader will note divergent ideas and visions of the 
future in the participants' interviews and testimonies regarding 
the timing of reform, its needs and possibilities, and who 
exactly can bear the burden of advocating and undertaking the 
mission. 
<H5>  First Interview: Introduction </H5>
  Many on the Palestinian scene support demands for reform. 
They see a need to end impromptu one-man action, build 
institutions, and put the right man in the right place. But they 
divide over timing. Some think that intensifying pressure on the 
Palestinian leadership at this time will weaken its negotiating 
ability, particularly as it is exposed to formidable pressures 
from Arab and international parties that for their part are 
exploiting the reformers' demands and the embarrassed position 
of the Palestinian leadership in order to demand concessions 
from it. Others think that this is the very time to build strong 
foundations for the coming national entity. They believe that by 
acceding to demands for reform, the leadership will strengthen 
its negotiating position and increase its immunity to Arab and 
international pressures. They say that the question of 
timing--that others might take advantage of public criticism 
leveled at misguided policies--has remained a sword waved over 
our heads for nearly a quarter of a century; yet our enemies 
hang out their laundry, talk to each other bluntly, make the 
necessary revisions, and emerge stronger. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] To which of the two points of view do 
you 
incline, and why? 
<H5>  Ridwan Abu-'Ayyash </H5>
  [Abu-'Ayyash] To begin, one must stress that the question of 
democratic dialogue within the one Palestinian household--to 
restructure and deepen it and build its institutions--is a vital 
demand for which the PLO has continued to work from its first 
inception and for which it has continued to fight to the present 
day. 
  Certainly the issue now on the table is the continuation of 
a 
previous course. It is an assured necessity. No one disagrees 
about it who believes that the institutions of the revolution 
should be converted into state institutions as a structure that 
can shoulder the burdens of organizing the entire Palestinian 
people, establishing its sovereignty, and arranging its 
institutional authorities. 
  When we talk about democracy or dialogue and about spreading 
an atmosphere of discussing these subjects among the ranks of 
the Palestinian people, I believe we all as a people bear full 
responsibility for such a structure. In other words, the 
prevalence of a spirit of initiative, organizing institutions, 
and strengthening the dynamic of their operation on a basis of 
description, classification, and institution building are 
matters that the people can undertake. 
  Timing must be taken into account, just as one must make 
certain that the method and means are salutary: for using a 
effective, efficient mechanism at a suitable time that fits the 
goal will surely lead to good positive results. Spreading 
dialogue among the ranks of the people is a matter that rests on 
leaders' shoulders and falls under the category of 
indoctrination, direction, and good mobilization. 
  When we talk about timing, I think the question is not when 
democracy and constructive, serious dialogue shall begin; 
neither is it when we shall or shall not approve it. Timing 
means choosing the best moment and time to make it succeed and 
to concentrate on it with the leadership. At the same time it 
must be built basically among the community's classes, 
institutions, and sections; for the leadership essentially is 
part of the people. When rules for the structure are produced 
and approved as a result of constructive dialogue, disagreements 
will be removed. The dimensions of disagreement will shrink, and 
the leadership's participation in the building process will 
become fruitful and fulfill its purpose. To further clarify the 
subject of the timing of the reform process, we say that 
democratic reform is not contingent on any particular time; 
however, before talking about it, one must define its meaning, 
goal, and means. These concepts must be brought to the grass 
roots so that they can interact, crystallize, and be framed, and 
so that consciousness of them can be spread. The soil in which 
the concepts grow thus will be made fertile. In any case, the 
concepts are a collective responsibility, not one limited to 
individuals. Therefore the question about reform and its timing 
should begin with another question: Has this subject been taken 
to the broadest ranks of the people? Who is doing so? Have we 
been able to bring the question to public notice and order its 
priorities, so that we can move from the base to the leadership? 
I want to stress now that we are not subject to a definite time 
in establishing and rooting democratic methods among the ranks 
of our people, who have fought and still are fighting for their 
realization. 
<H5>  Salih Qallab </H5>
  [Qallab] Reform is something required in every regime and 
revolution. After each stage, one must turn a new page. One must 
look at the previous stage's mistakes, to correct them and 
reform its corruption, if there was any. 
  As for what is being tried now--that is, raising the subject 
of carrying out democratic reform in the PLO and its 
organizations--the matter has been raised on the basis of the 
petition that was presented to Yasir 'Arafat. I do not think 
this memorandum will lead to any results, because the persons 
who prepared it were not qualified. For the most part they are 
members of the very PLO groups that have to be reformed or are 
cadres of the PLO itself. 
  Those who presented the memorandum may have had a variety of 
motives. It may have been an unfortunate imitation of the Wafd 
Party in Egypt. If the intention was to form a political party 
that would prepare itself for a role in the coming Palestinian 
authority, I think this road will not lead to what is desirable. 
  Many observations can be made about the performance of the 
Palestinian leadership. Far from being recent, these 
observations are very old. The reformists shared in the mistakes 
of the leadership on various levels. Indeed, most of them were 
spokesmen for the leadership: they were among those who played 
fiddle for it and cast its errors in favorable light. They were 
among those who incited its wrath against all demands for reform 
or correction. 
  Now, when the Palestinian leadership is embarking on a 
fierce 
battle and fighting on many fronts, it would be better for these 
people--members of the Fatah Revolutionary Council or political 
bureau members of FIDA [Palestinian Democratic Union], the 
Palestinian People's Party, or any other organizations--to play 
their role in their organizations. For the road followed by the 
"reformists" has been badly exploited by enemies of Palestinian 
nationalism who hunt for small mistakes by the Palestinian 
leadership, not to correct them, but to defame this course in 
the minds of the Palestinian and Arab masses. 
  Don't misunderstand me. Naturally, I am not saying that 
Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] is a democrat. It is unreasonable for 
us to demand that 'Arafat's leadership be collective, as if it 
were the leadership of a party in Switzerland or Sweden, not 
part of current Palestinian reality. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Then your objection is directed at the 
individuals calling for reform. 
  [Qallab] My objection is not to the individuals. All respect 
and love to them! But I do say that most of them are from the 
second-and third-echelon leadership. They are among those who 
participated in creating the Palestinian leadership in this 
form. I think most of them are out to improve their positions on 
the Palestinian ship of state or are seeking a special place in 
the current negotiating process. 
  We know all about brother Hani al-Hasan's opposition. He was 
at the head of the reformists and those demanding an improvement 
in Palestinian negotiating performance. Yet, as soon as he was 
brought into the arena, he forgot what he had being saying since 
the Madrid conference. I think his fellow "reformists" are 
following in his footsteps. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] But one notes that reform-minded 
independents are the backbone of the current movement--in 
addition, of course, to members of the groups. And the 
independents who have no link to the official Palestinian 
institutions are the most ardent of the current demanders of 
reform! 
  [Qallab] The story about independents on the scene is 
ridiculous. In reality it is an invention of Abu 'Ammar, when he 
was displaying Fatah supporters who were not among the 
movement's official members as if they were independents. The 
fact is that bias on the Palestinian scene is not 
organization-related, but political. I think that the 
independents who are members of the Executive Committee and the 
Palestinian National Council are closest to the Fatah political 
line and to Abu 'Ammar specifically. Frankly, I would say that 
although people who are organizationally independent may exist, 
there is no one who is politically independent. In this sense, 
the independents among the "reformists" are not independents at 
all. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Then do you object fundamentally to 
reform? 
  [Qallab] I do not object to reform. As I said, it is 
constantly desirable. But I do not see what is to be gained from 
forming from among the Palestinian groups that participate in 
the PLO a current that announces that it wants to lead the 
reform. Why doesn't reform take place first within these groups 
and parties and then widen to include the PLO and its agencies? 
So if the brothers want reform, they should leave their groups 
and form a powerful reform current responsive to the will of the 
Palestinian people. Unfortunately, as people say, "Fodder is of 
no use at the time of the attack." 
  The Palestinian people now need an entity--the establishment 
of a state--even if it is not democratic. A state first must be 
brought into existence. Afterward we can think about what can be 
called a luxury in the Third World--namely, democratic 
transformation. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Why not create democratic foundations or 
democratic political life before statehood, to guarantee the 
sovereignty of a state of rights, law, and institutions? 
  [Qallab] As I understand it, the "reformists" want to 
improve 
the performance of the Palestinian leadership in the 
negotiations; they do not want to lay foundations for the future 
Palestinian state. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] The memorandum and the points of the 
program that were approved subsequently explicitly advocate a 
Palestinian state and the importance of participation by the 
talents of the Palestinian people in these building processes on 
democratic foundations! 
  [Qallab] I believe that the Palestinian people, as a result 
of their special sufferings for more than 70 years, have 
produced a democratic reality--to differing extents and degrees, 
of course. The question now is whether we should put the cart 
before the horse. Now we want the enemy to withdraw from 
occupied Palestinian and Arab territory. We want to make a first 
step toward establishing an independent Palestinian state. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Demands for democracy are always 
desirable and persistent. Emphasizing that the Palestinian state 
should be a state of institutions and laws is a correct 
position. However, I ask whether the storm now being raised 
about reform by a group of people from within the Palestinian 
organizations serves this goal. 
  [Qallab] I think that even if intentions are good, this 
storm 
will not lead to [anything but] increased distortion of the 
Palestinian struggle and to its being portrayed as if it were 
merely embezzlements and misuse of authority. Reform from within 
the Palestinian scene must take place on the basis of conflict 
within unity. We must be careful to choose the steps required at 
each stage. In my opinion, the step required at this stage is to 
rally internally. That is the basis. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] However, the "reformists" today are from 
inside the Palestinian household and are its sons. No one can 
impugn the sincerely democratic and reformist intentions of Dr. 
Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, for example. 
  [Qallab] Let me say that the word "reform" has become a kind 
of romance. I think that Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi should not be 
behaving in this way. He is no onlooker; he belongs to the heart 
of the Palestinian political process. So he should by no means 
object like an outside observer, while he holds on to his 
position within Palestinian political activity. 
  Why, for example, didn't the Israeli negotiator sitting 
across from Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi at the same table resign, 
given that he too was surprised by the Oslo agreement? Do you 
think the head of the Jordanian delegation knows everything the 
Jordanian Government is doing with regard to the Middle East 
peace process? 
  Shim'on Peres agreed with Abu 'Ammar in Davos on a series of 
issues, and Yitzhaq Rabin did not agree on them. Yet Peres did 
not step aside from the negotiations, as Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 
'Abbas] did when Abu-'Ammar objected to the results of his talks 
in Cairo. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] We are not talking about individual 
responsibilities, but about the absence of a system of 
institutions in Palestinian activity--the absence of collective 
decisionmaking and continued monopolization of decisions by the 
Palestinian president. 
  [Qallab] The Palestinian case is very special. I am one of 
those who lived through the experience of the siege of Beirut, 
when Abu-'Ammar, despite the siege, made a point of collective 
decisionmaking. Being under siege, the Palestinian leaders had 
willingly entrusted all the reins of power to Yasir 'Arafat; 
which was something normal and understandable. I do not think 
that Yitzhaq Rabin makes his decisions after conducting a poll 
that includes all members of his party or the participants in 
his government. The most telling indication of this is the 
existence of the so-called inner cabinet, which makes decisions 
in Israel. Doesn't Yasir 'Arafat then have the right to have at 
his side a small consultative council that makes sensitive 
decisions and subsequently submits them to the wider and broader 
Palestinian cadres? 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Naturally it is his right. But the 
problem is that a considerable number of Palestinian talents who 
could form a trustworthy consultative council have left the 
ranks of official Palestinian activity--so many that it seems as 
if most of those around Mr. Yasir 'Arafat are the sort of men 
who tell him what he wishes to hear--not to mention their low 
competence level and major questions about their integrity. 
  [Qallab] The Palestinian decisionmaking mechanism took shape 
under well-known circumstances. Since the onset of the 
Palestinian revolution in the mid-sixties, there has been a 
struggle between those who want Palestinian decisionmaking to be 
independent of certain Arab regimes and systems, but not from 
the Arab liberation movement, and those who constituted 
extensions of certain Arab regimes onto the Palestinian scene. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Then are these Palestinian talents 
responsible for what his happening in the PLO's organizations? 
  [Qallab] No, I am not accentuating Abu-'Ammar's constant 
fear 
of certain talents. I can state that many of those whom 
Abu-'Ammar has established in sensitive positions to the 
disadvantage of [other] talents have formed bridges to certain 
Arab regimes on the Palestinian scene and have penetrated Arab 
and non-Arab security agencies. There is a law in revolutions 
that holds that the leadership should be protected from errors. 
I think that by staying away from Abu-'Ammar, Palestinian 
talents have paved the way for the spread of the flabbiness and 
bureaucracy that we now see and that are the cause of the series 
of errors that we now are attributing to the head of the PLO.

<F P=106> [Article by Mamduh Nawfal (Palestine National Council </F>
member, participant in negotiations to implement Oslo 
Agreement): "Major Obstacles Hindering Entrance of Palestinian 
Police to Gaza, Jericho"] 
  [Text] Following the signing of Cairo agreement number two 
on 31 March of this year concerning the situation in Hebron, 
there was much talk in political circles and the press about the 
entrance of Palestinian police to Gaza and Jericho. The talk 
climaxed by setting the days and hours for the entrance. Is it 
true that the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and Jericho 
and the entrance of Palestinian police to take up their duties 
there has become imminent? Will their appearance among their 
people be appreciated and respected? Or are there major 
obstacles hindering this entrance--obstacles that might mar 
their coming--not to mention other hidden obstacles that could 
surface in a moment? 
  As a preliminary to answering these questions, we must pause 
to consider the implications of the agreement concerning Hebron; 
for that agreement reflects the Israeli leadership's way of 
thinking and their modus operandi in handling the specious and 
artificial basic problems and obstacles that have appeared or 
will appear during the negotiations and during implementation of 
the agreements. I think there is no doubt in the Palestinian 
ranks that the agreement concerning treatment of the Hebron 
massacre was inadequate and that Palestinians are right to 
criticize it and consider it a negative sign of the policy and 
way in which Rabin has handled and will handle subsequent 
problems. At Rabin's insistence, the agreement lacked any 
mention or practical step against the settlers and their weapons 
and against their behavior. The Hebron massacre gave Rabin 
opportunities to make up for the time he has wasted since 13 
December to the present; yet he reaffirmed his insistence on 
continuing the policy of advancing slowly on the path of 
negotiations--a policy he has followed thus far since assuming 
office, especially after the signing of the Oslo Agreement on 13 
September 1993. The massacre gave him an opportunity make the 
racists, extremists, and all Israeli enemies of peace understand 
that they would not be allowed to toy with such major Israeli 
issues as the issue of peace; but he hesitated. Instead of 
removing the settlers from the city of Hebron and ending the 
friction there, he imposed on the people of Hebron measures that 
increased the friction, raised the degree of tension, and could 
lead to the evacuation of several thousand residents of central 
Hebron. 
  I think that anyone who wishes can register even more 
criticism of the Hebron agreement and those responsible for it. 
Yet this will not undo the fact that the agreement has been 
signed and become a fait accompli that, in coming days, will be 
translated into practical steps on the ground in Hebron. 
Norwegian, Italian, and Danish forces will arrive there shortly. 
I think their arrival is an important gain that must be seen and 
dealt with positively and that one must work to develop. The 
value of this foreign presence lies not in the military and 
security capability of these forces to confront the settlers' 
provocations and crimes--for these matters are beyond their 
capacity and outside the scope of their activity and 
responsibilities. Rather, it lies in the implications and 
dimensions of their presence itself. Their presence with Rabin's 
agreement means that he acknowledges that the West Bank and Gaza 
are occupied territory; for no one would accept the entry and 
stationing of foreign forces on his own territory. It also means 
that sovereignty over this territory does not belong to Israel; 
for a foreign presence involves a violation and challenge to the 
sovereignty that Israel claims over part or all of this 
territory. I think that the value of this presence will increase 
even more and become more and more prominent as greater numbers 
and more nationalities of foreign forces arrive in Gaza and 
Jericho under the provisions of the Declaration of Principles 
(DOP), which alludes to such a presence. 
  Regardless of the difference of opinions over the Hebron 
agreement, it has confirmed objectively that the positive 
momentum that the peace process has possessed to date remains 
greater and more powerful than the obstructive force that has 
grown in recent months. However, objectivity forces one to 
acknowledge that no one can be absolutely certain that the 
positive momentum can compel Israeli forces to hasten their 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho or cause the American cars and 
vehicles that have arrived for the Palestinian police to set out 
quickly in a few days' time on the Rafah-Gaza road and the South 
al-Shuna-Jericho road. Preventing the peace process from being 
torpedoed is one thing; accelerating the conclusion of final 
agreements is something else, with other considerations and 
calculations, especially on the part of the American sponsor. 
Although donor nations have moved energetically and have 
thankfully begun shipping the civilian and military aid needed 
to equip the Palestinian police, and although the Israeli side 
has begun to evacuate certain sites in Rafah, Gaza, and Jericho 
and has proposed that the Palestinian side send a delegation of 
senior officers for reconnaissance to prepare for the sending of 
the vanguard of the Palestinian police forces, it is also true 
that these steps remain formal and must not be allowed to cover 
over the large issues of dispute still being discussed and 
debated between the two sides. 
  The Palestinian side has estimated the size of the police 
force needed to cover the duties assigned to it at 10,000 men. 
For reasons relating to skill, experience, and urgency of the 
operation, it has insisted that 8,000 policemen should come from 
abroad and that 2,000 West Bankers and Gazans should be 
recruited later. Although the Israeli side acknowledges that 
major and varied missions await the Palestinian police, it is 
still haggling. In its most recent offer, it agreed to 9,000, 
with the number from overseas limited to 6,500. I do not think 
it will be difficult to reach a common denominator on this point. 
  Along with disagreement over numbers, there is substantial 
disagreement over the schedule for the withdrawal of Israeli 
forces and therefore for the entry of the main body of 
Palestinian police. The Palestinian side proposed to the Israeli 
side that negotiations on withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho be 
accelerated: one should work toward reaching an agreement on all 
the security questions without prejudicing the other issues on 
the table. However, the Israeli delegation rejected this and 
insisted on reaching an integrated "Gaza-Jericho First" 
agreement. It continues to regard the signing date of this 
integrated agreement as the starting point and date for the 
beginning of the Israeli withdrawal and the beginning of the 
entry of the main body of Palestinian police and their 
assumption of duties. According to the agenda that the two sides 
approved as a basis for the current negotiations, this means 
that the following problems would have to be discussed and 
resolved: 
  1. Economic issues: in this area Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators still must complete an agreement on labor and 
employment, farming and industry, tourism, banking problems, and 
the operation of accident insurance companies. 
  2. Legal questions: the Israeli side proposes discussing 
issues of jurisdiction, criminal jurisdiction, and cooperation 
in legal matters. 
  3. Civilian authorities: the two sides still have not 
resolved questions concerning water control and management, 
archaeology, and regional planning. 
  4. In security matters, besides the withdrawal plan and the 
police deployment plan, the negotiations still must reach 
agreement on the security laws dealing with individual 
incidents, the question of a temporary international presence in 
Gaza and Jericho, and the secure corridor back and forth from 
Gaza to Jericho. 
  If one ponders all these still unresolved issues, the main 
inference one can draw is that discussing and debating all these 
unresolved questions will require several weeks, if--and this 
must be emphasized--Israeli intentions are sincere. As the 
saying goes, the man who has been bitten by a snake fears the 
trail of a rope. The Palestinian side has been stung by Rabin 
three times: first when he put off negotiating for a year before 
entering the Oslo channel; second when he missed the 13 December 
date set in the Declaration of Principles for beginning 
withdrawal; and third when he protected the racists and 
extremists in Hebron and allowed them to stay there. If the 
visible unresolved questions confirm that the Israeli side is 
going to miss the 13 April date for full withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho according to the provisions of the Oslo agreement, 
we shall be faced with ample time that Rabin and the Israeli 
negotiating delegation will try to fill with formal moves such 
as the entry of a group of leaders for reconnaissance, the entry 
of 300 policemen into Gaza, Rafah, and Jericho, or beginning to 
design and build joint liaison offices. 
  I think this stretch of time will witness a race between 
those international, regional, and local forces eager for 
progress and success in the peace process and those local and 
regional forces that oppose the process. Each of the two 
tendencies will throw its full weight: the former to pass 
through the period in peace and safety. I think we shall notice 
the practical translation in the movement of American planes 
toward Cairo and al-'Arish airports, carrying military vehicles 
and armored cars for the Palestinian police, and in the movement 
of planes from donor nations, carrying the remaining kinds and 
quantities of military and civilian equipment. It will also be 
seen when Norwegian, Danish, and Italian forces land at 
al-'Arish and Cairo on their way to Hebron. The other tendency, 
particularly the racist, extremist forces that are friends and 
allies of Rubinstein, naturally will concentrate its efforts on 
committing a new massacre somewhere. Why not, when the massacre 
at Abraham's Tomb derailed negotiations on the Oslo agreement 
for six weeks, and when the punishment it received was very 
light and was not without an implied compensation! 
  From now on, until the signing of the final agreement on 
implementing the Oslo agreement, talk about the entrance of the 
police will continue and may increase, but it will remain 
nothing but talk until the beginning or middle of May. I believe 
that great and varied tasks await the Palestinian side from now 
until such an agreement is reached. These tasks include 
developing the management of the negotiations and improving the 
negotiating method itself. It is no accident that the 
Palestinian negotiating delegation lacks specialists and 
experts. It is also damaging nationally for experienced and 
skilled residents from inside [Palestine] to remain absent from 
the negotiating table. Another task is to plan and prepare the 
forces needed to undertake the great and varied work that will 
have to be accomplished on the ground in the West Bank and Gaza. 
Anyone who thinks that the success of the Palestinian police in 
their patriotic missions depends on good training, large 
numbers, or powerful equipment is wrong. The basis of their 
success lies in good behavior with the people. Above all, it 
lies in effecting a qualitative change in people's lives. Such a 
desired change can be made only by mobilizing all resources and 
energies and by relying on the collective organizing role of 
institutions.

<F P=106> [Article signed by "Y.L.": "Islamic Fundamentalists in </F>
France: A New Haul; Thousands of Official Algerian Documents 
Uncovered"] 
  [Text] Among the documents seized are blank identification 
papers and affidavit forms from the High Commission on National 
Service [HCSN], also blank. 
  These documents (511 national identity cards and 606 HCSN 
affidavit forms) were uncovered by French security services 
after a search of the homes of two presumed former Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS] sympathizers, El-Hadj Chaib Eddour, an 
Algerian citizen, and Ahmed Seba, an Algerian holding French 
citizenship. These two individuals had been arrested and 
questioned on 21 March for their role in a drug trafficking case. 
  Yet more seriously, at Ahmed Seba's home the French police 
had discovered an Israeli Galil assault rifle, two 9-mm PA 
loaders, as well as several boxes of shells. All of which would 
earn him another charge, namely criminal association of being in 
contact with a terrorist enterprise. 
  However, according to VSD (a French magazine), which broke 
the background to the story on an exclusive basis in its most 
recent issue, the discovery of the documents happened 
accidentally. 
  The origin of this haul, according to this magazine, was an 
investigation begun in early December into a drug trafficking 
network. 
  Two different agencies, the general intelligence office [RG] 
and the Judiciary Police [PJ], had begun an investigation into 
the same group of suspects, but for two different reasons: the 
RG was interested in the GIA [Armed Islamic Group] support 
network aspect, the PJ in a heroin trafficking operation. Until 
this precise moment, French security forces still did not 
suspect that they were going to make the extraordinary discovery 
of the official Algerian documents. 
  It was only after the arrest, on 21 March, of 18 members 
(including Chaib and Seba) and the search of their premises that 
the secret was discovered. There was a huge network producing 
counterfeit Algerian documents. A fair share of these papers 
were already in envelopes bearing the addresses of their 
addressees in Algeria. 
  When questioned, Seba would admit that these documents were 
meant for members of GIA, the terrorist group. 
  He is reported to have stated that he had left them at 
Chaib's house at the request of a certain Boudjellal Chemellal, 
a presumed GIA member, and that he had done so under the threat 
of reprisals against members of his family. 
  Still, according to Seba's admission, Boudjellal was also 
the 
owner of the Israeli assault rifle and the load of ammunition. 
  These facts would, in fact, provide concrete evidence for 
the 
French security agencies and authorities that the GIA has indeed 
managed to set up a support and logistic network in France, 
which is closely connected with drug trafficking. 
  Better yet, French police have even established a connection 
between this case and certain individuals arrested as part of an 
operation last November code-named "Chrysanthemum" aimed at 
circles of sympathizers and activists in France of the former 
FIS. 
  That evidence is the discovery of a photocopy of the 
verification order issued on 12 November against Larbi Beddiaf, 
a member of the FAF [Algerian Brotherhood in France], who was 
questioned for being [part of] a criminal organization in 
contact with a terrorist enterprise. 
  Last, it should be noted that Chaib and Seba as well as 
Boudjellal, for whom the examining magistrate issued an 
international arrest warrant, are not known and therefore not in 
the files of the French and Algerian security agencies.

<F P=106> [Interview with Paul Marie de la Gorce, managing editor of </F>
DEFENSE NATIONALE, by Omar Belhouchet; place and date not given: 
"Algerian Society Has Considerable Capacity for Resistance"] 
  [Excerpts] Paul Marie de la Gorce, expert on Arab politics, 
diplomacy, and military affairs, recently made a "working visit 
to Algeria." President of the Study Committee on National 
Defense and managing editor of the monthly review DEFENSE 
NATIONALE, he took the opportunity of this visit to consult a 
broad range of players in the current Algerian crisis. In this 
interview, he explains France's position on the phenomenon of 
religious fundamentalism and describes France's policy toward 
the Maghreb and the Arab world in general. 
  [Belhouchet] The week you spent in Algiers gave you the 
chance to meet many people. What is your appreciation of the 
situation in Algeria? 
  [De la Gorce] My appreciation could be summed up in two 
observations. The first bears on the indisputable capacity for 
resistance of Algerian society in general, in its diverse 
aspects, against what we will call for simplicity's sake "the 
armed Islamist opposition." I would say very frankly that 
overseas, at least when I left Paris for Algiers, the climate 
was very pessimistic regarding Algerians' capacity to resist the 
armed Islamist movement. 
  So I must say that the resistance is considerable. It is 
expressed in diverse ways, of course--by the attitude of the 
government, the conduct of the army, the actions of the security 
forces, and also by the specific security policy pursued by the 
regime in place. Let us not forget the manifest existence of 
ideological political camps that are determined, as I see it, to 
stoutly resist the armed Islamist opposition. 
  The second point I would make is that this camp comprises a 
complex mix of elements, as diverse as Algerian society itself. 
The political and social hierarchy in all its totality also 
includes those who pour out in the streets to demonstrate 
against the prospect of a religious state in Algeria. The 
divisions within this camp were striking. It seems that this 
camp has a great deal of difficulty uniting and focusing its 
efforts. 
  [Belhouchet] Observers think France's policy toward Algeria 
has changed In the last six years, especially since the right 
came to power. What is your view? 
  [De la Gorce] I think the initial tone taken by French 
leaders vis-a-vis Algeria was set in 1992. There were all sorts 
of arguments that official policy should distance itself from 
what was happening in Algeria and from the regime in place. 
  Following the interruption of the electoral process, it was 
thought the growing power of Algeria's Islamist currents was 
irreversible, so there was a great deal of concern about the 
situation and a feeling that France should stay very far away 
from that process. But in October 1992, a decisive turning point 
was reached. 
  Dumas's visit to Algeria, followed by the visit of Belaid 
Abdesselam and Redha Malek to Paris, resulted in large financial 
commitments. This new direction was maintained by the new 
government, after the 1993 legislative elections in France. 
  I should note that French policy is determined jointly by 
the 
president and the prime minister, and the two men feel the same 
way about Algeria, i.e., that it is necessary now to support 
Algeria in its struggle against the armed Islamist opposition. 
Although that judgment is the starting point, there may be 
fluctuations from time to time regarding tactics or the language 
to be used. Sometimes it is stern and categorical in support of 
the government in place against an opposition described as 
"terrorist." At other times, one might think the most important 
thing was to do something for those fighting against the armed 
Islamist opposition rather than saying something that would have 
no real-world impact. The general tenor of French policy is more 
the former. [passage omitted] 
  [Belhouchet] One has the impression France is giving Algeria 
a sort of wink and a nod, as if to say, "We can help you, but 
make up your mind where you're going." 
  [De la Gorce] I do not mind at all when people say France 
and 
Algeria have a special relationship. But the root of the problem 
lies with the Algerians: Nothing can substitute for their own 
collective will. The choice of a certain type of society is one 
for Algerians to make. I think that for many reasons this choice 
has been delayed and fretted over, because you are looking for 
the reaffirmation of a national identity in Arabization and 
Islam. At the same time, some Algerians were committed to 
modernity. 
  There was a reliance on ideological foundations that did not 
prove as sound as one might have hoped and that may have 
diverted Algeria from the path of modernization, from developing 
the kinds of social attitudes needed to participate effectively 
in the modern world. 
  One must never lose sight of the fact that in history, as in 
life, there is no such thing as a complete break. One never 
starts over from the zero point, even when leaders are replaced. 
We are saddled inescapably with the consequences of cultural, 
economic, and social choices made in the preceding period. 
  It seems to me it is not very profitable to denigrate a 
regime, such as the one in power today, which is taking 
important steps forward. The accord with the IMF is the largest 
since 1988. It marks Algeria's decision to take a path on which 
other states have already embarked. 
  [Belhouchet] Do you have the impression that the Islamist 
movement in Algeria is completely sui generis? Why do you think 
there is so much atrocity, so much hatred, when initially it was 
an opposition movement that was allowed to express itself and 
even enjoyed a great deal of sympathy all around the world? 
  [De la Gorce] Without going so far as to dispute the 
uniqueness of the Algerian situation, one should not forget that 
manifestations of political and religious fanaticism are 
extraordinarily violent elsewhere too. The unfortunate way the 
Iranian regime behaved and evolved was also extremely violent. 
We see terrible violence in Egypt. I think one must consider the 
logic of conflict. At first, all sides, even those trying to 
seize power, are sensitive to public opinion, the need to form 
alliances, to pay attention to the international context. But 
the logic of conflict leads to the unleashing of violence. 
  We must realize that such violence feeds on itself. Thus it 
does not surprise me very much that things have reached the 
present juncture. This kind of thing is characteristic of 
violent and armed struggles in general. So I would cautiously 
suggest that we should not forget that in the history of 
Algerian political movements there have been what one of your 
compatriots, historian Mohamed Harbi, termed very powerful 
plebeian tendencies, which continued into the period after 1945, 
into what we have called the Algerian War. 
  [Belhouchet] Despite all the crimes it has committed, not 
even sparing foreigners, the fundamentalist movement has 
continued to enjoy support abroad, notably in France. 
  [De la Gorce] Yes, in France, we have this very strong, very 
negative, irrational and absurd reaction, but it's pretty 
widespread. I would like to draw your attention to the fact the 
same reactions can be seen in other countries--and the example 
of the United States is particularly revealing in that regard. 
You published in EL WATAN an extremely revealing report of 
remarks made by a U.S. State Department assistant 
secretary-designate before a congressional committee, which 
reflected very accurately the attitude I myself observed several 
weeks ago in Washington among members of the majority 
party--namely, the feeling that Algeria has been on the wrong 
path since the interruption of the electoral process, that in 
the last analysis the Islamist current is the one most 
representative of Algerian society, that the country is sinking 
into internal turmoil that will end in civil war. 
  I recall that two American officials were criticizing the 
Algerian Government because in the face of an armed Islamist 
opposition it would be incapable of moving ahead with the 
monetary, financial, and economic reforms indispensable not only 
for its own future but simply to restore order. 
  [Belhouchet] What is the main tenor of the U.S. 
Administration's current thinking on Algeria? 
  [De la Gorce] The predominant view more or less favors a 
compromise with the Islamist camp. There is a different school 
of thought holding that the struggle against Islamist 
fundamentalism must be pursued because it is a dangerous 
phenomenon, with Iran the seat of infection and Sudan a 
secondary locus of contagion. 
  [Belhouchet] As you leave Algeria, what feelings do you take 
with you? 
  [De la Gorce] My feeling is that the determination of men 
and 
women opposed to a takeover by the armed Islamist opposition is 
such that the latter will not succeed. But naturally I cannot 
predict the duration of that struggle--or the forms it may 
assume. I also think it is too soon to predict whether those 
resolved to destroy the armed Islamist opposition will have a 
quick victory, because there is more to the struggle than just 
the security dimension.

<F P=106> [Article by Mohamed D.: "New Security Dynamic: Hundreds of </F>
Terrorists Eliminated"] 
  [Text] So, according to our estimate, these operations made 
it possible to disable hundreds of barbarians from being able to 
do harm. 
  Since the start of this campaign in mid-March, close to 400 
terrorists have been killed and just as many arrested. Cities 
such as Blida, Chlef, Medea, Kseur-el-Boukhari, and, most 
recently, Tiaret, which were said to be "hard to reach," have 
been cleaned of their savage hordes. 
  In the same spirit, the special courts (responsible for 
cases 
of terrorism and subversion) have been reactivated. Hundreds of 
Islamic fundamentalists arrested for having been part of armed 
groups and taking part in assassinations, hold-ups, acts of 
sabotage, etc. have started appearing in front of these agencies 
of the law. Close to 350 terrorists are supposed to appear this 
month in the Algiers special court alone. 
  In Oran, several terrorists groups appear in court each day. 
Stiff sentences are handed down. They thus pay for the crimes 
they have committed. 
  Knowledgeable observers are delighted with these new 
measures. "The armed arms of Islamic fundamentalism," they say, 
"have been pinned back; but that is not enough. These new 
measures should be accompanied by radical policy decisions and 
fundamentalism should be fought tooth and nail." 
  Indeed this experience has shown that security measures 
alone 
are not enough. Policy action is even more important. 
  As for the Islamic fundamentalists, they have understood 
this. They have divided up the tasks. Some kill, others talk. 
Among the latter, some harden the tone and others appear 
conciliatory. 
  One single objective unites them. The establishment of an 
Islamic state. 
  On this subject, chahid Boudiaf said: "Stopping the 
electoral 
process had become necessary. Using Islam for partisan and 
political means, demagoguery and lies for some time were able to 
achieve an impact on those in this system who were excluded, on 
marginalized people. To this should be added the complicity of 
certain areas of the government." 
  "Today it becomes more and more evident that collusion 
exists 
between the party in power, fundamentalism, and, unfortunately, 
a certain partisan opposition..." 
  Thus continuing to believe that it is possible to contain 
the 
fundamentalists through legal means is but an illusion. 
  This could be fatal for the country. 
  As for those who talk about respecting the constitution, it 
might be time for them to think of implementing it. Law No. 
89-II dated 5 July 1989 pertaining to political associations 
says in its Article 4, final paragraph: "furthermore the 
political association cannot base its creation or actions on an 
exclusively religious, linguistic, regional, sexual, racial, or 
certain professional status basis." 
  The law could not be clearer. This paragraph bans the former 
Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], Hamas [Islamic Society Movement], 
Ennahda, and all their satellites. 
  As we have often emphasized, Islamic fundamentalism is 
ruthless towards the weak. The more you make concessions to it, 
the more it demands. It knows no bounds. It is not generous. 
Delays are not its problem. It wants everything and wants it now. 
  To fail to understand this policy would be to play into 
their 
hands.

<F P=106> [Article by Yacine Lahcene: "Why Does the Islamic Salvation </F>
Front Not Want To Stop Terrorism? Some Truths About the Armed 
Groups" -- first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] The meeting between Layada, who at the time was an 
"emir" of the GIA [Armed Islamic Group], and Abderazak Redjam, 
who was in charge of information for the dissolved Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS], well illustrates this determination by 
the FIS to take over terrorism. 
  When Boukhamkham and Djeddi say that their bosses have made 
no commitment to bring an end to terrorism, they know whereof 
they speak. However the FIS, the initiator of the violence, does 
not control the armed groups; it is but one part of them. 
  The student has sort of surpassed his teacher. But the 
dissolved party has never given up in its attempt to take over 
the terrorist groups. But this effort has been in vain, since 
the terrorist bosses cut the hierarchical link before the 
legislative elections, since they thought that the FIS's two 
leaders had failed in their mission to establish an Islamic 
state. 
  The meeting between Layada, who at the time was an "emir" of 
the GIA, and Abderazak Redjam, who was in charge of information 
for the dissolved FIS, well illustrates this determination by 
the FIS to take over terrorism. 
  At the beginning of 1993, the two men held a meeting in 
El-Biar, at La Scala, at the insistence of Redjam. It was 
decided to suspend the publication of the ENNAFIR (Redjam) and 
ECHAHADA (Layada) newsletters because their contents were 
contradictory. It was also decided to suspend the "Wafa" pirate 
radio station, whose news regarding the GIA's actions was 
untruthful. 
  Indeed, during each program, that radio station announced 
that "thousands" of police and soldiers had been killed, that 
there had been epic scuffles, and other wildly inflated stories. 
  But the meeting also addressed "the drawing up of a joint 
working platform in anticipation of a congress that would bring 
together all clandestine factions and the leadership of the 
dissolved FIS." Redjam's attempt to take over is clear. 
  For the second meeting, Layada demanded that Mohamed Said, 
whose real name is Lounis Belkacem, be present, "for more 
credibility." The latter would not come and Layada refused to 
continue the discussions with Redjam. Another member of the FIS 
similarly issued an invitation to the GIA for the same purpose. 
A dispirited Omar El Eulmi, the president of the SIT [Islamic 
Labor Syndicate], was working under the command of Mansouri El 
Miliani. He charged Djaafar El Afghani with pleading his cause 
with Layada. 
  Layada received him in a hut next to the Draa-Dis Mosque. "I 
expressed my wish to see El Eulmi join our organization, which 
lacked a figure of his stature in the religious area," Layada 
would say. 
  He would go on to say that it was on the basis of El Eulmi's 
fatwas that elements from the armed groups had become 
uncontrollable, carrying out assassinations left and right. 
Interference by the FIS is not welcomed by the GIA's "emirs," 
who are already faced with constant leadership wars. 
  So a defiant Layada stated that "the assassinations of 
certain intellectuals was the work of the FIS's clandestine 
leadership. Redjam had drawn up a list of intellectuals to be 
assassinated by small groups that the police were not searching 
for." The GIA thus saw its monopoly on terror threatened by the 
FIS. Also money was at the root of quarrels between the 
dissolved party and the armed movement. A major call for a 
return to order was necessary before Iqbal Madani returned some 
of the money he was holding in Morocco. 
  How are the huge sums that come from holdups, racketeering, 
and gifts managed? The way in which the money coming from the 
holdup of the BEA [Algerian External Bank] on Rue de la Liberte 
was used will provide an idea: 100,000 French francs [Fr] were 
given to Abassi Madani's son Iqbal by Hocine Abdelhamid to 
"acquire weapons from Morocco and bring them in." 
  Did Madani Iqbal abscond with the money? "These weapons did 
not arrive," Layada said. He met Madani Iqbal at the Khaled 
Hotel in Oujda. He demanded from him the money that had been 
collected abroad "while making a death threat against him." 
Madani Iqbal acknowledged the facts and hinted that the 
Fr100,000 had helped purchase the PM Uzis, which had been 
brought into Algeria. With Zaoui Ahmed present, "next the money 
collected by Madani Iqbal abroad, and which amounted to 750,000 
dollars, was deducted." Doubtful that these funds had really 
helped purchase weapons, Layada made him "sign an IOU." To 
demonstrate "his good conduct with regard to the armed Islamic 
groups," Madani Iqbal offered Layada a batch of weapons hidden 
in his Mercedes. Madani Iqbal had purchased six other luxury 
vehicles and driven them into Algeria. 
  When the events and the statements by the arrested 
terrorists 
have been reviewed, it becomes clear that the GIA, often led by 
semi-illiterates, is but a fragile assemblage of small groups 
led by local emirs who derive their authority from violence. The 
first groups formed before the electoral process was interrupted. 
  Layada would be quick to be put on the scent of these new 
armed groups being put together. At a meeting at the Bachir 
El-Ibrahimi Mosque, the decision was made to "make contact with 
the other groups being put together so as to be better 
acquainted and adopt a common action strategy, and to move 
directly to armed action if that is necessary." One week later, 
representatives from the armed groups in Boufarik, Blida, 
Baraki, El-Biar, and the Casbah met at the Fares Mosque (Casbah). 
  A dejected Khiar Mohamed, upon being named the coordinator 
for these groups, emphasized "the need to move to armed action 
by declaring a jihad against miscreants and anything that 
symbolized the state." Armed actions against representatives of 
the security forces, which are symbols of the state, were 
planned. The aim was also to acquire weapons. 
  So it was following the June 1991 insurrection that armed 
groups began to form under the aegis of Chebouti Abdelkader, 
Mansouri El-Miliani, Allal Mohamed, and others. They went into 
action before the electoral process was interrupted (with 
attacks on the Blida courthouse, the Guemmar barracks, etc.). 
  Layada went underground after the national gendarmerie burst 
into his home in Baraki, where he had been with some other 
terrorists. His life was saved because he hid behind his 
sister-in-law and fired on the darak's captain. The latter did 
not wish to fire back lest he kill the woman. Layada escaped and 
hid in Blida. But it was the events in Tamezguida that were to 
propel him to the rank of "national emir." Allal Mohamed, 
nicknamed Moh Leveilley, the head of the GIA, was wounded during 
the attack on the city Surete of Draria on 20 May 1992. He 
charged Layada, who at that time was his official driver, with 
reconstituting his groups. 
  Allal Mohamed "chose to work in isolation in relation to the 
other armed groups led by Chebouti and Mansouri El-Miliani." 
Hocine Abderrahim, the financier behind the attack on the 
airport--who was sentenced to death and executed--, failed in 
his many attempts to bring them together. For the reconciliation 
meeting held in Zbarbar in April 1992, which was attended by 
Mansouri El-Miliani, Chebouti Abdelkader, and Hocine Abderrahim, 
Allal Mohamed had sent a representative. His attitude was that 
"he was not ready to accept working under the aegis of Mansouri 
El- Miliani or Chebouti because they were not action leaders and 
thus could not measure up to him." 
  Layada returned to Algiers, to Draa Dis, so he could better 
supervise "Moh Levilley"'s armed groups. Incessant harassment by 
the police forced the latter to send his terrorists to 
Tamezguida (Blida). Touati Achour, the emir for that region, put 
storage rooms, which had long been readied, at their disposal. 
It was then that the famous reconciliation meeting took place 
that had been brought about in September 1992 by Allal Mohamed, 
whose ambition it was to become the national emir. His argument: 
"He had the hard core of the armed groups at his disposal." 
Chebouti, "armed with an MAT 49," Allal Mohamed, "armed with a 
PA, Si Ahmed Mourad, alias Djaafar El-Afghani--shot down in 
Bouzareah--, "armed with a PA," Hocine Abderrahim, and others 
were present. 
  The fierce leadership battle had begun. Owing to the 
"disorder," the agenda was postponed. Chebouti kept his title as 
national emir and each armed group would "continue to be active 
in its area, according to its means." At dawn, the forces of the 
National People's Assembly [ANP] intervened. "Each man fled on 
his own without asking about the others." Layada, Chebouti, and 
Touati Achour would flee on foot through mountains and on trails 
until reaching Larbaa, where they found refuge in ammunition 
storage rooms. Makhloufi Said, who had boycotted "the Tamezguida 
meeting," was suspected to having collaborated with the security 
forces. It was only on the fourth day that Layada learned his 
boss had died. The post of emir had fallen vacant... 
  Towards the end of October 1992, in a bungalow, which a 
woman 
had made available to them in Baraki, Layada was unanimously 
named national emir. A disheartened Afghan, Sedjane Khaled, the 
main ring leader of the attack on Khaled Nezzar, was charged 
with rallying the Afghan groups. Attia Sayeh, nicknamed 
"Younes," who was assumed to have been shot, and Djaafar 
El-Afghani's successor, was named the emir for the wilaya of 
Medea. These armed groups reused the GIA's acronym used to 
designate Mansouri El-Miliani's "dislocated" groups, the 
majority of whose members had rejoined Layada. The two round 
seals bearing the letters "GIA," which had previously been used 
by Mansouri El-Miliani, were recovered. As an aside, they had 
been manufactured in Pakistan. But it would not be soon before 
Layada fell as well. In March 1993 he traveled secretly to 
Morocco at the insistence of activists there and of whom, 
according to Layada, there was a great number (especially the 
"Afghans"), who had money and weapons and in no way felt 
concerned by being in Moroccan territory. When there, they 
explained to him that an Majlis Ech-Choura [FIS Central 
Committee] had to be put together and that another "national 
emir" had to be appointed, as he was accused of being "brutal" 
and "illiterate." They wanted to substitute a certain Khathir 
Ben M'hinda, nicknamed "Moussab," the emir of Constantine, for 
him. The meeting ended without this being accomplished, but 
Layada's term heading up the GIA was at an end. He was in fact 
arrested by the Moroccan [police]. Sid Ahmed Mourad succeeded 
him under circumstances that are totally unknown. As his 
temporary replacement, since he was killed last March, it has 
been reported that Sayeh Attia has been named. But for some days 
now, Attia as well is reported to have been killed. Does a new 
boss need to be sought from among the names that have been 
mentioned? In any event, the succession is a "tantalizing" one 
in view of the booty held by the GIA and confirmed by Layada.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Bensalem: "FLN's All-Or-Nothing Position"] </F>
  [Text] The reply of the FLN [National Liberation Front] 
political bureau to the letter of Mr. Youcef Khatib, adviser to 
the presidency, asking political parties and associations to 
declare before 16 April whether or not they will participate in 
the National Transition Council (CNT) was made public 
yesterday... 
  No, says the FLN. In its letter, made available to EL WATAN 
yesterday, it declined the invitation to attend the 20 April 
meeting at the presidency that was called to allocate seats 
among those participating in the dialogue. The decision came at 
the end of Monday's meeting of the FLN political bureau. The FLN 
position hardly comes as a surprise, given the statements its 
secretary general has made to the press, recent political bureau 
communiques, and the latest statements from its central 
committee, which met on 13-14 January. 
  According to the reply the political bureau sent to Mr. 
Khatib on Monday, the FLN--which had said often before it was 
not bound by the decisions of the national conference that it 
had boycotted--believes "the fundamental questions raised by the 
FLN and other parties in different forms have not been debated, 
nor have they been embraced as necessary elements for the 
reaching of an accord or the real basis of the national 
consensus..." 
  The FLN political bureau--more specifically some of its 
influential members, who were alledged to have virtually offered 
the party to the highest bidder--has returned in its latest 
statement to the decisions of the last central committee 
meeting, in order to show it is not acting against the wishes of 
the party rank and file; it notes, for example, that the party 
has decided "not to endorse any de facto authority or tarnish 
the party's good name by lending a fictional legitimacy to such 
authority," and "not to solicit any positions of responsibility 
for its militants that lack a mandate of the people." 
  It thus appears very likely the transition will go forward 
without the participation of Mr. Mehri's party, since the latter 
does not approve the presidency's handling of the transition 
period in accordance with the "national consensus platform." 
According to the political bureau, "prolonging the transition 
period for three more years to pursue the same policy followed 
since the interruption of the democratic process, designing 
structures to implement it, and continuing to ignore the 
people's will...does not contribute to political pacification or 
resolve the serious, complex crisis consuming our whole society." 
  The political bureau added nothing to what it has said 
before 
about what is needed to resolve the crisis. The only thing 
missing from the bureau's letter was the party's previous appeal 
for "an in-depth and broad dialogue." A constant theme in the 
FLN's earlier statements, it was omitted, curiously enough, from 
the bureau's letter to Mr. Khatib. In fact, no mention is made 
of participation by the now-dissolved FIS [Islamic Salvation 
Front] in such a dialogue, despite the fact the FLN has always 
claimed such participation was a vital necessity in any search 
for a solution to the crisis. It may be stretching a point to 
speak of a "change" in the FLN position on the issue, but the 
question is worth flagging. 
  The expected defection of the FLN, followed probably by 
other 
parties that hold similar views about the dialogue, places the 
presidency in an awkward position as it proceeds to set up the 
transition structures, beginning with the National Transition 
Council at the end of this month. 
  A close analysis of the statements of the various political 
parties--some of which admittedly are resorting to hyperbole in 
an effort to increase their influence--would suggest the future 
"assembly" may be composed of little more than the 
representatives of civil society and a handful of fairly small 
political parties. 
  Indeed, all indications are the transition process will be 
carried out with the cooperation of the very same forces that 
participated in the national conference and adopted the 
"national consensus platform." Some observers are already 
raising the question of the "legitimacy" of the transition 
structures, especially the future CNT, from which the most 
influential parties, the most obvious candidates for membership, 
have been excluded. President Zeroual's plans already have been 
thrown off schedule by the departure of the Redha Malek 
government; now the presidency has only a few more days to 
convince all sides to participate in the transition phase.

<F P=106> [Article by Akram Belaid: "Economic Elites </F>
Embittered"--first paragraph is LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES 
introduction] 
  [Text] The imminent accord between the IMF and the Algerian 
Government is not going to ameliorate the plight of cadre and 
heads of enterprises. The latter live in fear of terrorist 
attacks against themselves or their businesses. And they feel 
they are kept poorly informed about current economic conditions 
in Algeria... 
  0930. Hamoudi Belatache, general manager of an EPE (economic 
public [i.e., parastatal] enterprise[.sup]1[/] that 
specializes in distribution, finishes reading the four major 
local French-language dailies. "For some months now," he sighs, 
"the only economic news I get comes from the newspapers." Most 
public-sector industrial leaders are in the same boat. Political 
uncertainty and questions about the future are making both 
supervisory ministries and participation funds (similar to 
boards of directors on which other EPEs hold seats) increasingly 
tight-lipped. Many managers complain of being kept in the dark 
about developments in the just-concluded negotiations with the 
IMF (see LA TRIBUNE of 11 April 1994) and decisions coming in 
the next few months about the restructuring of the Algerian 
economy. "The metaphor of a ship captain battling the storm 
alone is not too strong," says Hamoudi Belatache. "Today, 
everyone knows things are going to change, but I can't even 
allay the misgivings of my executives or other employees by 
telling them what is going on. How can we talk about 
`motivation' when the very survival of the enterprise as an 
economic unit is in question?" 
  Two days before, three men armed with automatic rifles 
appeared on the premises of the enterprise. A guard, seriously 
wounded, managed to sound the alarm. Firemen responding to the 
alarm were able to save a large part of the company vehicle 
fleet from the fire the terrorists had set in an effort to 
destroy it. The damage: a truck destroyed by fire, and the 
departure of three guards whose families received threats the 
day after the attack. The past year has seen an ever-increasing 
incidence of arson, sabotage, and hold-ups targeting public 
enterprises. Many industrialists say security has become a major 
concern in their everyday lives. "I'm looking out first of all 
after myself," one of them confides. "As manager of a public 
enterprise, I am seen by the terrorists as an accomplice of the 
state. We are under as much of a threat as journalists and 
intellectuals. A friend pointed out to me the other day that the 
fact I have a duty vehicle and driver could make them mistake me 
for a government official--except that I don't get the same 
close protection." So this manager no longer keeps regular hours 
or arranges appointments over the telephone, trembles whenever 
his secretary announces visitors, and compulsively calls the 
office three times a night to make sure all is well. Despite all 
the terrorist attacks, the Algerian Government does not seem to 
be moving quickly to respond to industry's need for protection. 
The much-publicized addition to the security forces of the first 
graduating class of security agents is not enough to calm 
employers' fears. "Arson destroyed part of our facilities," 
explains the manager of a furniture manufacturing company. 
"We're still waiting for supplemental appropriations to install 
effective systems." Installers of alarms, anti-intruder systems, 
and remote surveillance equipment are overwhelmed by requests 
for estimates, but firm orders are few and far between. "I 
wonder sometimes if the state really knows what's going on," 
muses the manager of Secu-electro, a small PME [small or 
medium-size enterprise] specializing in industrial security. 
"Every day our technicians visit Algerian companies where it 
would be child's play to gain entry and set a fire." 
<H5>  Image Problems </H5>
  So far, most public enterprises are doing well just to post 
sentry teams composed of regular employees. "It would be 
stretching the truth to say all workers feel personally 
concerned about this," says Hamoudi Belatache. "Motivating them 
by trying to tell them that because the enterprise is partly 
theirs they owe it to themselves to protect it amounts to 
reviving demagogic slogans of the socialist era that no one 
wants to hear anymore." 
  Years of centralized, bureucratized management have also 
tarnished the image of managers. Most blue-collar workers still 
equate them with the nomenclatura of the old regime and believe 
all their managers, with or without diplomas, are equally 
incompetent. So it is difficult, at a time of rumors of massive 
layoffs, to be candid with employees, especially since the 
majority of them voted for the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. 
Interior Minister Selim Saadi acknowledged recently that some 
workers had been involved in setting fires at their own 
enterprise, often under duress but sometimes on their own 
initiative. Unthinking, vindictive actions... "As a general 
rule, Algerian employees do not like management," says Hamid 
Larbaoui, instructor at the Advanced Institute of Management and 
Planning. "Under the circumstances, the heads of public 
enterprises oscillate between authoritarian and paternalistic 
approaches, both of which tend to engender hostility. The 
contradictions are exacerbated, naturally, by the climate of 
violence raging in our country, and the company's internal 
cohesion is put to a rugged test." 
  Even while faced with the urgent need to cope with a 
deteriorating security environment, public-sector enterprise 
managers must try to keep up production levels. The growing 
scarcity of foreign exchange and drastic reductions in raw 
materials imports have caused industrial production levels to 
plummet to less than 50 percent of capacity. "The situation is 
almost catastrophic," says the manager of a garment factory. "We 
produce little, and what is worse, we sell little." It is easy 
to see why. The crushing weight of external debt, which leaves 
nothing left for investment, is one of the prime villains. Also 
cited repeatedly is unfair competition from the black market, 
which imports the finest quality Western products from Tunisia 
and Morocco on a massive scale. But few managers questioned 
admit the need to completely rethink their production options 
and the way their company is organized, even though 
restructuring is the order of the day. Last autumn, a report 
prepared by experts underlined the necessity of rethinking 
Algeria's development model. The entities most directly 
affected, public enterprises, are marking time, waiting for 
their fate to be decided, while local experts entertain serious 
doubts about the ability of managers now in place to implement 
the coming reforms. 
  "The majority of public enterprises have been audited by 
international research consultancies," explains an official in 
the Ministry of Industry and Mines. "We have concrete solutions 
that will make the EPEs the spearhead of economic activity. What 
we do not know, though, is whether the public-sector enterprise 
managers are going to work with us." The latter say they are 
ready to adapt to the market economy. "I hope at last I will 
have the chance to do what I am professionally trained to do," 
says the manager of an enterprise that manufactures industrial 
machinery. "We have never had the means to be managers. The 
enterprise was always subject to outside influences. 
Interventions by the minister or politicians were and still are 
pervasive in every domain. If I issue a call for tenders, I know 
the choice of foreign supplier will not be ours. If I start 
hiring, I will have a dozen applicants forced on me, and if I 
decide to fire an insubordinate executive, I will come under 
pressure from every direction to rehire him." Educated at elite 
institutions, dispatched frequently on "overseas missions," 
Algerian managers dream of being able to put into practice the 
expertise that local exigencies have always relegated to the 
backburner. "In the meantime, we content ourselves with managing 
day-to-day activity," Belatache confesses. "That means signing 
documents put in front of me and receiving the occasional 
Western commercial representative stationed in Spain, analyzing 
for the nth time our plans--temporarily on hold--for a 
partnership with some Italian firm." 
  Optimistic in spite of all obstacles, public-sector 
employers 
hope the successful IMF negotiations will presage a long-awaited 
break with 30 years of statist economics. That question is on 
everyone's lips, even though many local officials are predicting 
that the Algerian state will do everything possible to 
"rehabilitate" the EPEs. "Many employers are uncomfortable about 
seeing their enterprise privatized," admits a member of the 
national union of public entrepreneurs [UNEP]. "Some, naturally, 
are afraid of losing their job, but a fair number simply 
mistrust private entrepreneurs, whom they judge very harshly." 
  Long marginalized, the private sector is gradually coming 
out 
of the shadows. Employer associations have become indispensable 
partners in the social dialogue, while large financial groups 
have been put together to prepare for the opening of the 
economy. But few Algerians believe private-sector industrialists 
will be able to play a dynamic role. Redha Hamiami, himself both 
an entrepreneur and minister for small and medium-size 
enterprises, admitted recently that the private sector did not 
have CEOs able to become competitive managers in the global 
marketplace. In the end, the minister says, it will be necessary 
to call on managerial skills of foreigners and encourage 
public-sector managers to start up their own enterprises. "We're 
just like the public sector," shrewdly observes one official in 
the Algerian Employers Confederation. "It is true we have never 
had the benefits that were showered on the EPEs, but most of us 
still depended on state-imposed protectionism for profitability. 
Decontrol of foreign trade is going to cut a wide swath of 
destruction. At present, and with very few exceptions, our 
manufactures aren't competitive--even within the Maghreb." 
<H5>  Battle for Finance </H5>
  Little by little, a new breed of employer is emerging. The 
majority are young, most have attended an Algerian university, 
and they have decided to create their own business rather than 
join the swollen ranks of executives in the state-owned 
companies. "I don't have anything to do with the branch of the 
private sector that has grown fat under the protection of state 
monopolies," claims Azzedine Fares, who heads a printing house 
in the suburbs of Algiers. "Being a young private-sector 
entrepreneur in Algeria is a constant struggle." There's no lack 
of battles, and the biggest is the battle to obtain financing to 
support production. Azzedine must constantly "chase after 
black-market foreign exchange." The French franc is worth 13 
dinars on the parallel market, while the official rate is 4:1. 
"The private operators that meet at the big hotels in the 
capital and owe their fortunes to the largess of the system 
under Boumediene and Chadli are not having problems. They know 
where to get lines of credit, and they jealously guard that sort 
of information," says Azzedine, who hopes to form an association 
of private entrepreneurs. (If established, it would be the fifth 
of its kind, as Algerian entrepreneurs are incapable of 
unifying.) 
  The only thing that unites the private operators are the 
"shakedowns" that victimize them all. Karim Zerrouki, who heads 
a construction company, is among those who has "paid." On the 
order of a hundred million centimes, in a series of small 
installments, and there is absolutely no way he can afford to 
report it to the police. The scenario is almost always the same. 
First comes a letter telling the private-sector CEO "to prepare 
to contribute to the war effort." Next comes a telephone call 
setting forth the amount to be paid, and finally an impromptu 
visit by several young men, always elegantly dressed, to pick up 
the cash. Sometimes, what is even more terrifying, a letter is 
delivered in the name of the Armed Islamic Group or the Armed 
Islamic Movement. "There is nothing to be done about it," says 
Karim Zerrouki. "Even private-sector industrialists who are tied 
in with politicians opposed to the Islamists have paid. You have 
to budget for shakedowns the same way you make provision for 
possible losses on currency exchange, the erratic tax regime, 
and inflation in the price of foreign currency on the black 
market." 
  In all these tribulations, it is the managers of the local 
public enterprises (EPLs) that suffer most. These small 
state-owned PMEs, mostly operating in the red, may end up being 
sold on the auction block to the highest bidder--a scheme that 
the government of Redha Malek, which resigned yesterday, refused 
to give up despite protests from the unions, though it did agree 
to postpone implementation until after the forthcoming 
devaluation of the Algerian dinar. "It has now been more than 
six months since our workers have been paid," explains the 
manager of one EPL. "The banks do not want to hear about it, and 
the government, after an initial effort at financial reform, 
announced a year ago it was going to sell the EPLs. The workers 
are frustrated, hanging on to the hope the enterprise will be 
bought by a rich private investor with deep pockets." This 
embittered manager, who hopes to find a position in an EPE, 
notes nothing is being done to prepare public-sector managers 
like himself for the change. Many EPL managers are trying to 
create an association to lobby against systematic privatization 
of the local enterprises. "The state has never listened to the 
voices of public-sector enterprise managers," regrets one member 
of UNEP, "and it is greatly to be feared that the liberalization 
under way will blow us away like straw in the wind." 
<H5>  Brain Drain </H5>
  Engineers, architects, doctors, young graduates, and 
experienced managers are leaving Algeria in ever larger numbers. 
In the last few months, the trickle has grown to a veritable 
hemorrhage. "I'm getting out so my daughter can get decent 
schooling," said Kader, a department head at Algiers effort, the 
other day. The slow decay of security conditions and the very 
real fear of a sudden slide into civil war are spurring many of 
the Algerian elite to emigrate. Morocco and Tunisia are the most 
popular destinations, far ahead of France. "Mr. Pasqua can 
relax," quips Hadi Moncef, head of an agrofood enterprise. 
"Algerians with diplomas or money know it will be 10 times as 
easy to relocate in the Maghreb as in France, to which it is 
almost impossible even to get a simple tourist visa!" 
  Many private-sector entrepreneurs have resettled in Tunisia, 
especially in the Zarzis free zone or in the Tunis suburbs. No 
visa or work permit is required, and Algerians there are 
standing in line for jobs, mostly managers from the public 
sector who decided they have had enough. "Setting up a company 
is much easier in Tunisia than in Algeria," gloats an 
entrepreneur in the construction field who liquidated all his 
assets soon after the failure of the national dialogue 
conference. "And I can hire Algerian cadres who would never have 
agreed to work for me in Algeria." 
  By contrast, relatively few entrepreneurs have installed 
themselves in Morocco, though the latter attracts a goodly 
number of Algerians with graduate degrees and former 
public-sector managers. "Morocco and Tunisia will reap the 
benefits of Algeria's education policy," drily notes an official 
in Algeria's Education Ministry. According to a recent study 
made by a private consultancy for a Western client, two out of 
three white-collar Algerians are considering leaving Algeria 
before the end of the year. 
  The prospect disturbs both political decisionmakers and 
employers, confirms Ould-Khallef Farid, a member of the Algerian 
Employers Confederation. "The departures will be bad for the 
economy here. Liberalization of external trade and future 
privatizations will create a large demand for expertise and 
professional experience that is going to be difficult to meet." 
Many specialists note too that, in contrast to the trend in the 
1980's when numerous students on scholarships defected overseas, 
it is experienced cadres that are leaving now. 
  Not even the flagships of Algerian industry have been 
spared. 
Thus training program officials at Sonatrach [National Company 
for the Transport and Marketing of Hydrocarbons], a state-owned 
oil company that has been largely immune from austerity, admit 
they now think long and hard before sending cadres to training 
programs overseas. "Any training abroad will improve their 
resume," admits one computer engineer who hopes to be able to 
emigrate legally to Canada. 
  "We talk a lot about the flight of the intellectuals," 
concludes a functionary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, 
"but the emigration of employers, managers, and white-collar 
employees is more serious, even if less publicized."

  [.sup]1.[/] There are two types of public-sector 
enterprises in Algeria. Economic public enterprises, EPEs, are 
an outgrowth of the restructuring of big state-owned companies 
in the early 1980's. The local public enterprises, EPLs, are 
smaller--rather like public-sector PMEs--and they are owned or 
controlled at the local government level.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Kheireddine: "The Devaluation: The Fallout </F>
and the Consequences"] 
  [Text] Since the Algerian economy is too dependent on 
imports, as exports with the exception of hydrocarbons have 
barely much importance, the effects of an increase of the value, 
in dinars, of petroleum receipts (an increase in tax receipts 
and a reduction of the budget deficit) are blurred in the face 
of the negative fallout of this harsh devaluation. 
  First negative effect: an increase in prices for imported 
products. This measure will affect products that are widely 
consumed: bread, milk, semolina, and flour. 
  The recent price increases for these subsidized products, 
which conveyed the determination of the government vis-a-vis the 
IMF, anticipated the present devaluation. The Economy Minister, 
Mr. Benachenhou, had said regarding this first increase that 
prices were still far from their real cost. Given the extent of 
this devaluation, it is certain that these basic products will 
again experience a major hike. 
  Other essential products such as cement, wood, iron, and 
cement will rise in price, thus worsening difficulties for those 
who do their own building. 
  The slim hope of getting housing cherished by a large part 
of 
the population would seem to evaporate with this evaluation. The 
1991 dinar devaluation experience can enlighten us about the 
devastating effects of a major depreciation of the local 
currency. That depreciation had led to a major price hike and 
made the financial difficulties of businesses more acute. Public 
and private sector businesses, which have not yet recovered from 
the effects of the dinar's 1991 devaluation, risk going under 
and not escaping from the collapse. Unless the government 
decides to cover businesses' exchange losses and thus give them 
new financial support, which is something that risks aggravating 
the budget deficit, an outcome that is opposed to the objectives 
of the measures drawn up jointly by Algeria and the IMF, i.e., 
seeking to control the budget. When businesses' financial 
difficulties are aggravated, they will also be tempted into 
compensating for exchange losses by increasing production costs. 
Roughly speaking, if today a mechanism to protect the less 
fortunate is foreseen, the process of erosion on the purchasing 
power of that segment of the population with low income 
resulting from the devaluation cannot be halted by a similar 
arrangement. 
  At best, the social safety net softens the consequences of a 
deterioration of their purchasing power. 
  Furthermore, the fallout from a devaluation of the dinar 
will 
especially affect the middle class. The pauperization of this 
large swath of the population, which accounts for the 
"mainspring" of Algeria, will not take place without there being 
damage to the country's activity. 
  The goal pursued by the IMF through its Structural 
Adjustment 
Program (SAP), which will be applied to Algeria--the devaluation 
being a measure that is part of the SAP--is to contain demand by 
households and businesses. 
  In simple terms, Algeria is living beyond her means. She 
needs to reduce consumer needs and achieve a balance between 
demand and goods put on the market. This return to universally 
accepted economic rules constitutes, according to the 
international financial institution, the sine qua non to regain 
the path to growth. 
  In exchange for this sacrifice made on the population as 
represented by the loss of its purchasing power, Algeria will 
receive the financial support of the IMF and her traditional 
creditors and will be able to reschedule her debt. 
  This will avoid stopping payments during the second quarter 
of 1994.

<F P=106> [APS article: "May Day: Associations Join in a March Against </F>
Terrorism"] 
  [Text] Professional trade unions and sociocultural 
associations met yesterday at Press Headquarters in Algiers in 
order to organize a national march against terrorism for May Day. 
  The chairman of the organizing committee, Mr. Mahmoudi, 
stated that this national march would be one of "all workers and 
citizens who are opposed to terrorism" and "are for civil 
peace." The route for the march, it was said, goes from Martyrs 
Square to May Day Square. 
  "Eighty-seven (87) associations have joined in this 
initiative, which is of a nongovernmental, nonpartisan nature," 
said members of the organizing committee, which is made up of 
the UFCA (Union of Algerian Financiers and Accountants), the AJA 
(Association of Algerian Journalists), the AAA (Association of 
Algerian Architects), the association of imams, the national 
association of telecommunications engineers, the Association in 
Memory of Mohamed Boudiaf, and the national coordinating board 
of womens' associations. The organizing committee is also in 
contact with the UGTA (General Union of Algerian Workers) so as 
to link the main trade union organization with this initiative, 
it was added. 
  Furthermore the committee anticipates launching an 
international caravan including artists and cultural figures who 
will give talks to make international opinion more aware of the 
situation in Algeria, and in the future sponsoring charitable 
events to bring in gifts to benefit families which have been 
victims of terrorism. 
  The caravan will go, it is hoped, if sufficient means are 
collected, to Brussels, Paris, Rome, Montreal, Washington, and 
Tunis. 
  The committee will also speak with the ENTV and the ENRS 
(television and radio) to organize a May Day telethon to assist 
families that have been victims of terrorism.

of Its Nine Lieutenants Not Yet Identified"] 
  [Text] When the security forces broke up the Djaffar 
El-Afghani group in Bouzareah, in an area overlooking Algiers, 
nine terrorists including Djaffar El-Afghani were killed. This 
group, we would remind [readers], was preparing to commit crimes 
and set fire to businesses throughout the entire month of 
Ramadan. 
  It was a diabolical operation that was halted by security 
forces. 
  Now if Djaffar El-Afghani, the presumed head of the GIA 
[Armed Islamic Group], and five of his other lieutenants have 
been identified, the others have not, it has been learned from a 
well-informed source. 
  The same source said that their identification is under way. 
Let us observe that terrorist groups, to prevent any 
identification of their members struck down by security forces, 
use a method that consists of burning or mutilating the bodies.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The minister of industrial 
restructuring and participation yesterday cleared the confusion 
surrounding the possible privatization of state-owned companies. 
The privatization of state-owned companies is impossible, Mr. 
Mourad Benachenou said during his address yesterday to private 
contractors on the occasion of a workshop organized by the 
minister of small and medium-sized enterprises at Sofitel Hotel 
in Algiers. 
  Mr. Benachenou indicated that his mission, in the new 
ministry, does not mean that the state is abandoning public 
productivity but rather restructuring the public sector on the 
basis of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. 
  The social situation constitutes another obstacle to the 
privatization of state-owned companies. Mr. Benachnou pointed 
out it is impossible to compromise the rights of workers at the 
expense of a national economic ideology and then adopt that same 
ideology. 
  Mr. Mourad Benachenou has also shed more light on the link 
between restructuring and privatization and said: 
  [Begin Benachnou recording] This operation is going to 
follow 
and reinforce the operations aimed at ensuring the monetary and 
financial stability we have negotiated with the IMF. Anyone who 
twists the meaning of the discussions on industrial 
restructuring and establishes a link between this restructuring 
and privatization is reducing the importance of the mission of 
this new ministry, which was added to the new government. In any 
case, the main problem is to make the productive sector more 
efficient, regardless of its legal status, whether in the public 
or private sector. [end recording]

  [Text] The proceedings of the Executive Committee of the 
General Union of Algerian Workers [UGTA] opened this morning at 
the Palais des Nations, Club des Pins [a conference hall in an 
Algiers suburb] to examine and assess the activities of the 
union's National Secretariat, prepare for the forthcoming 
congress, and adopt a decisive position on the country's current 
situation. Over to Mahfoud Mennane with the following dispatch: 
  The proceedings were opened by the union's secretary 
general, 
Mr. Abdelhak Benhamouda, who touched on several topics, 
including those relating to organizational and legislative 
matters and to the preparations for the union's forthcoming 
congress. In his opening address, Mr. Benhamouda talked about 
several issues, including the current political and economic 
situation in the country and the pressures to which the union is 
being subjected. 
  Regarding the economic issues, particularly those relating 
to 
the government's agreement with the IMF, the leader of the trade 
union expressed his dissatisfaction with this agreement, for as 
he put it, it will have negative repercussions on the working 
class in our country. He added that the trade union had not 
been informed beforehand about what was going on during the 
negotiations with the IMF. 
  As regards the negotiations between the trade union and the 
government, Mr. Benhamouda said that the union had made enormous 
efforts to clinch some of the workers' rights. He added that 
what has been achieved is the minimum until the file of wages is 
opened. During this meeting, Mr. Benhamouda expressed the trade 
union's fear for the workers' future in view of the trend 
towards privatization. In this respect, he had this to say: 
  [Begin Benhamouda recording] There are many Algerians who 
say 
-- even just from an economic point of view for we must talk 
about economic efficiency -- that if you hit the public sector 
now the crisis will deepen and will not be resolved. Why? 
Because the Algerian economy depends, for 70 percent, on the 
public sector. Therefore one cannot destroy or hit 70 percent to 
depend on the remaining 30 percent. Furthermore, these 30 
percent also depend on these 70 percent. [end recording] 
  It is worth indicating that at this very moment the 
proceedings are being held behind closed doors.

  [Text] The proceedings of the seventh ordinary session of 
the National Executive Committee of the General Union of 
Algerian Workers [UGTA] were concluded today with the adoption 
of a number of decisions to confront the present social and 
economic situation. 
  Among these decisions is warning the authorities of the 
consequences of procrastinating in responding to the workers' 
previously expressed social and economic demands; opening talks 
with the government; and also demanding an increase in wages and 
the minimum wage level in accordance with the price pattern 
known by the market. Additionally, the decision notes the need 
for concluding social laws for strengthening workers' 
deteriorating purchasing power, protecting the public sector, 
and preserving jobs. Reference has also been made to the use of 
all legitimate means to prevent the privatization of public 
enterprises.

<F P=106> [Article by Sami Abu al-'Iz] </F>
  [Text] Egypt has a number of commissions and authorities 
created to oversee the exportation of Egyptian goods. These 
include two commissions headed by the prime minister, Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi: The High Commission for Export Promotion and the Supreme 
Export Council. A third, headed by the economy minister, is the 
Export Promotion Commission. There are also numerous others, 
including the Central Council for Export Promotion, the 
Commission for Export Support, Export Oversight Authority, and 
the Export Development Bank. Dr. 'Atif Sidqi announced at a 
recent meeting with the Federation of Industries and Chambers of 
Commerce that he would soon create [another] high commission for 
export promotion, to be headed by him. 
  How much longer will the government keep on forming 
commissions that convene and meet to no other end than the 
formation of still other commissions and organizations, thereby 
restarting the cycle anew without the adoption of effective 
measures? How much longer will government policies continue to 
be mere slogans and more commissions that exist on paper only 
and are removed from reality? Do we in fact have need for new 
commissions to promote Egyptian exports? What are the obstacles 
difficulties that prevent existing commissions from doing their 
job? How can we free Egyptian products from the bottleneck and 
ease their flow into foreign export markets in order to compete 
with international products? 
  The strategy for economic relations with the outside world 
determines the course such relations must take in the years to 
come. As such, they are supremely important, have the most 
profound impact on the development of the national economy, and 
are inexorably tied to and have a correlation with domestic 
economic policies and with regional and international 
developments. 
  A report issued by Specialized National Councils pointed out 
that the primary purpose of devising a strategy for economic 
relations with the outside world is to cultivate contacts that 
will lead us to define objectives for that strategy that would 
serve the public interest at the various stages of the national 
economy, ensuring that those objectives are in harmony with 
domestic economic policy objectives and with the capabilities of 
the national economy as well as with the world economic 
developments, especially international trade, capital movements, 
and the type and intensity of competition in world markets and 
the regional and international combinations that govern them. 
Once the objectives of the new strategy are defined, policies 
must be devised for their realization. 
  A specialized report emphasized that, in the absence of a 
clear international economic strategy, the various economic 
policies being pursued will, in fact, result in a haphazard 
strategy lacking a logical method for defining objectives and 
policies establishsed to achieve them. Such a stragety will also 
not take into account the coordination of these objectives with 
other national economic goals as well as regional and world 
developments. This is the basis upon which the policies that 
will achieve those objectives will be selected. 
  The report discusses the current status of our economic 
relations with the outside world and points out that the trade 
balance of commodity exports and imports has been consistently 
in deficit over the years. The trade deficit gap widened from 
64.1 million pounds in 1952 to 162.4 million pounds in 1970 to 
19,115.8 million in 1989/90, for a 300-percent growth. The trade 
deficit is worsening because commodity imports are growing at a 
faster rate than commodity exports; the ratio of exports to 
imports having declined from about 70 percent in 1952 to about 
23 percent in 1989/90. The ratio of the trade balance deficit to 
GDP is also considerable. 
  Raw cotton is no longer in first place among commodity 
exports. Whereas it accounted for 85 percent of total exports in 
1952, now it is almost not exported and accounts for only 33 
percent of aggregate exports in 1989/90. If we factor in Egypt's 
imports that year of short-staple cotton, it becomes clear that 
Egypt has become a net importer of cotton. 
  The report went on to point out that the character of the 
balance of payments in previous years is but the end result of 
the strategies pursued in those years, whether deliberate and 
planned, as such, or simply the cumulative outcome of successive 
decisions and choices made over time. But those developments 
mandate a reevaluation of Egypt's strategy for its economic 
relations with the outside world in order to keep it in tandem 
with domestic and international developments and in order to 
optimally serve the interests of the Egyptian economy. 
  The report urged that industrial and agricultural commodity 
exports and tourist revenues be increased at higher and 
accelerating rates--since these components inevitably carry the 
major burden of accomplishing the desired balance of payments. 
However, this in no way ignores or diminishes the importance of 
other balance of payments revenues. 
  The report also advised that agencies with oversight over 
commodity exports should be scrutinized again in order to 
facilitate and abbreviate the procedures involved in dealing 
with them. Stricter standards should be enforced in order to 
improve the quality of exports to the level necessary for 
efficient competition in overseas markets. Government and 
quasi-government agencies concerned with foreign trade and its 
development should undertake detailed marketing studies of 
potential exports and of likely markets, and should publish 
those studies and make them available to all who are involved 
with exports in Egypt. 
  The tax structure and the various fees applied to exports 
should also be reexamined. Export operations should be granted 
ample and wide-scale exemptions. The pricing system for 
agricultural exports should be abolished. Relations should be 
bolstered with economic blocks in Europe, Asia, and the Western 
Hemisphere. For our exports to those blocks, we should seek the 
same preferred nation treatment granted other categories of 
developing nations. 
  Will the commission soon to be formed under Dr. 'Atif Sidqi 
keep those considerations in mind? Will it accomplish its 
targeted objectives in order to enable Egyptian exports to 
compete in world markets? 
<H5>  Change of Policies </H5>
  Egyptian exports, including petroleum, have a total value of 
$4 billion. The value of petroleum exports is slightly more than 
$2 billion. Exports other than oil are valued at less than $2 
billion, according to economic experts who point out that this 
ratio is minimal in comparison with many other countries. We are 
supposed to bring the volume of exports up to a reasonable level 
since our experts are currently at no more than 5 percent of 
GDP. We must bring this ratio up to at least 15 or 20 percent. 
This means that we must boost exports three-fold. This would 
require a lot of things, such as improving and raising 
performance levels in order to compete in world markets. We must 
begin by identifying that group of goods in which Egypt could 
have a comparative advantage and, consequently, with which Egypt 
can face world competition. We should also produce products 
suitable to the tastes of consumers abroad. The study of foreign 
markets, their needs, patterns of consumption, and 
specifications of popular goods is therefore of value for 
promoting future exports. We must wade through the arena of 
establishing export services companies whose preoccupation would 
be to study markets and their needs and define specifications 
for the products they want, thereby establishing a link between 
Egyptian producers and foreign importers. 
  Experts likewise emphasize that we must change our mind-set, 
from merely exporting surplus to establishing firms for the sole 
purpose of exporting. We should also attempt to prepare 
ourselves for world market developments, and the liberalization 
of foreign trade, anticipated as a result of signing the Uruguay 
Round agreement. This requires effort on the part of Egyptian 
exporters in order to meet the challenge of penetrating world 
markets and protecting domestic industry by improving quality 
and features and offering products at reasonable prices. 
<H5>  Pressures </H5>
  Dr. Ahmad al-Ghandur, formerly dean of the faculty of 
economics, points out that the Cabinet has instructed the 
economics minister to form a general committee to study the 
economic impact of the new GATT agreement and formulate future 
economic policies in order to take advantage of the agreement 
and avoid its negative impact. Such is a commendable action 
taken by all countries. However, that committee's report should 
avoid generalities and should draw a detailed future program. I 
believe that this is no more than tactics, since we have 
persistently taken a flawed approach to the export problem long 
before the current cabinet. To promote exports is to restructure 
the Egyptian economic structure. Resolving the problem of 
exports in Egypt, in the sense of relying on exports as an 
essential means requires changing the nature of the Egyptian 
economic system by focusing its policies, procedures, and 
administrative structure on reducing production costs, improving 
product quality, linking the Egyptian economy to the outside 
world with advanced information systems, and giving enlightened 
institutions charge of the new national undertaking, because 
this is a matter of "life and death." 
  In dealing with the export problem in this fashion, the 
Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade has equal, if not less, 
responsibility for exports than the Ministry of New Urban 
Commnities. Building worker housing in new cities helps exports 
more than anything imaginable that the Ministry of the Economy 
can undertake at the present time. The Ministry of Industry 
could likewise do more for exports than the Ministry of the 
Economy by offering technical assistance to all industrial units 
in Egypt. The same goes for other ministries. 
  Dr. Ahmad al-Ghandur, commenting on the story about creating 
a new export commission in the next few days, said that the only 
explanation for this is that the government is under pressure to 
transform the Egyptian economy into an export economy in order 
to break free of the current crushing crisis. 
  Another explanation he cited was that all previous export 
promotion commissions and institutions have had very little 
output and that the prime minister has come to believe that the 
solution lies in changing the nature of the economic system in 
its entirety. The creation of the new commission is therefore 
dictated by political considerations. All we have to do is 
quicken the pace of our basic thrust to transform the economy 
into an export economy and simultaneously announce the failure 
of steps based on the philosophy rooted in creating one 
institution or making minor adjustments to another. People are 
well-aware that the institutions created for that purpose have 
failed to achieve their goals and that export promotion has been 
relegated to the media "headlines." Focusing on the actual 
performances of institutions such as the Export Oversight 
Authority, the Export High Commission, and the Export 
Development Bank, and others, we find great disparity between 
nomenclature and function. Exporters view the performance of 
Export Oversight as restraint of the export function that does 
not go beyond good intentions. The Misr Export Development Bank 
is no different in function or performance from any other 
commercial bank. 
<H5>  The Bottleneck </H5>
  "We all must concur that we need to promote exports and that 
that is a major development for us if we are to emerge from the 
bottleneck and overcome our balance of payments and general 
budget deficits," thus began Dr. Hasan Ghallab, dean of the 
College of Commerce at 'Ayn Shams University. He explained that 
there is no disputing the need for a commission that would work 
to provide the elements needed for the promotion of exports; but 
that the multiplicity of commissions without well-defined 
responsibilities causes the emergence of conflicting procedures, 
except perhaps if the creation of the proposed commission means 
making its predecessors obsolete. The methodology of providing 
procedures conducive to export promotion is a function of market 
mechanisms and also a function of other societal factors and 
variables. The strategy, for instance, is to avoid exporting 
products that society needs, especially at prices lower than 
those of comparable imports. In other words, there is no harm in 
exporting a product that has a substitute of reasonable quality 
that can be imported at lower cost. Naturally, both products 
cannot be of identical quality if imports are lower in price. 
Furthermore, there are certain products that distinguish the 
Egyptian market, for example long-staple cotton. There is no 
reason at this time why we should not import short-staple 
cotton, since it is cheaper, while encouraging the export of 
long-staple cotton, provided that Egypt has mechanical systems 
capable of the optimum utilization of imported products. We 
should not lose sight of production for the sake of export 
promotion. It should be noted that I would not permit the 
exportation of certain commodities and encourage the importation 
of alternatives if costs to importers were lower since that 
would create idle capacity in society at a time when the state 
is diligently seeking a solution to the unemployment problem. 
The proposed commission must also simplify export formalities." 
  Dr. Ghallab concluded: "I hope that the issue of export 
promotion will not come at the expense of what is necessary to 
keep food in people's mouths. I also hope that export revenues 
of foreign currency will be retained in the country and put to 
work here; and that the magnificent national capitalism would 
restore the glory Egypt once had in the era of Tal'at Harb, 
'Abbud Pasha, and other ingenuous patriotic businessmen." 
<H5>  Production and Marketing </H5>
  If the issue of export promotion is an important matter for 
the economies of all countries, then the success of that policy 
would depend on two important factors--production and marketing, 
and opening new markets, according to Dr. Faraj 'Abd-al-Fattah, 
instructor in economics at Cairo University. 
  On production, he says that we must utilize the concept of 
comparative advantage when producing all products by determining 
that their requirements are particularly available plentiful and 
that conditions are conducive to their production--farm 
products, for instance. The concept of comparative 
advantage-based production means producing at world standards 
but with less cost than in other countries. 
For marketing purposes, we must promote our output through the 
coordinated efforts of sponsors as well as of diplomatic 
missions (trade representatives) in various countries. This 
would necessitate scrutinizing many aspects of marketing, such 
as the positions of our competitors in those markets as well as 
consumer tastes in those markets, their incomes, and the degree 
to which they would accept substitute products. 
  It takes this two-pronged approach to develop and revive our 
exports. A single approach is not sufficient to market a product 
and export it. That product must first conform to international 
standards and must be produced at low cost. But markets must 
also exist. 
  The professor of economics added: "The uniform tax law 
provides exporters with tax incentives in order that they may 
boost their exports, but this is not sufficient in itself. 
Exporters need the availability of extensive but reliable 
information in order to accurately define their markets. Such an 
information network should be a priority of the various 
commissions concerned with export promotion." 
<H5>  Export Surge </H5>
  Dr. Rida al-'Adl, professor of economics at 'Ayn Shams 
University's College of Commerce, has no objections to adding 
new commissions to those already in existence or to 
restructuring existing commissions or redefining their 
functions, because this is all perfunctory and natural. The 
issue of forming a new commission headed by Dr. 'Atif Sidqi may 
explain the special importance currently attached to exports 
which have become a question of life or death for us. If we 
could sustain current markets as we penetrate new ones, we could 
first utilize idle capacity and develop new production lines to 
create new jobs for workers, raise incomes, and improve 
development in general. This applies to all sectors whose 
products or services may be in demand abroad. Exports today are 
the checkpoints on the road to economic prosperity, and a new 
high commission must be created for them. Egypt has great 
economic potential, but actual exports are low. We must 
diligently work for a substantial surge in Egyptian exports. 
<H5>  Duplication </H5>
  Economist Dr. Sharif Lutfi believes that some of the 
agencies 
that oversee exports, such as the Export Development Bank, have 
distinct functions that they are indeed performing. Commissions 
concerned with policymaking, on the other hand, include some 
that were created but have never functioned and therefore do not 
get to practice their specialties. 
  He said: "I am less concerned with commissions than I am 
with 
the policies pursued, because it is those policies that will 
determine our success or failure in export promotion. Such 
policies include aspects dealing with taxation, with shipping 
exports and raising them to the standard needed for exportation, 
and with government or private efforts to expand export markets. 
  "In any case, it is necessary that exporters participate in 
devising and categorizing such policies so they will not 
exclusively reflect government outlook that may be removed from 
commercial reality. 
  "It is also of value to select a number of nontraditional 
exports and focus on propelling them in such a manner that the 
push is concentrated on a limited and specific number of 
nontraditional exports. When we have succeeded in doing this, 
then we can move on to another group of nontraditional exports 
in order to expand their markets. 
  "Pound exchange rate policies must also be taken into 
consideration because of their great impact on export 
profitability."

  [Text] Export is a national goal and the priority of the 
day in the national action program. Export means increasing 
output capacity and employing all productive capacities in 
society. This in turn means expanding activity areas and 
absorbing a percentage of existing unemployment to "lift" the 
Egyptian economy from "stagnation" to "recovery." 
  However, exporters face procedures that limit their 
activity. 
They must pay fees, which increases the cost of goods and makes 
them unable to compete in foreign markets. 
  An exporter must pay eight different fees, the most recent 
of 
which is an explosives detection fee, even though security is 
the responsibility of the state, not exporters. That fee alone 
brings in 15 million Egyptian pounds per year. 
  An exporter must also pay the value of 18 stamps; submit 
about 15 documents, including a certificate, a form, a license, 
an invoice, a receipt, etc.; and go through about 45 steps to 
complete export procedures. This, according to a report prepared 
by a joint committee of the Finance and Foreign Trade Ministry 
and the Federation of Industries. The report, submitted to the 
prime minister, "defines" problems and "recommends" solutions. 
Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi told me, following one of these 
meetings, chaired by President Husni Mubarak over a two-day 
period to discuss increasing exports with relevant ministers and 
heads of industrial and trade organizations, that he considers 
export "a key" to solving existing economic problems by 
stimulating output, increasing investment, and creating new 
jobs, which will drive the Egyptian economy into the "boom 
state" for which we all are striving. Prime Minister Sidqi said 
that we want to plan to push export capacity into the tens of 
billions of dollars annually. 
  Economy Minister Mahmud Muhammad Mahmud told me that the 
problem is the trade deficit. He said, "I am not so much 
concerned with achieving a balance of `payments surplus' as I am 
with limiting the `trade balance deficit.' This deficit is 
behind the debts and stagnation. Hence, I am hoping for an 
increase in the export capacity [text mistakenly says "import 
capacity"]. All of us, the government and exporters, are placing 
ourselves in the service of this national goal. Before us are 
markets with which we can do business, such as the Arab and 
European markets. We have done business with the expanding 
American market to remedy the large deficit with the United 
States." 
  The economy minister said that last year's trade deficit 
totaled more than $7 billion or 2.4 Egyptian pounds. However, a 
series of resolutions, to be announced following this week's 
plenary meeting chaired by the prime minister, contain 
comprehensive solutions for all of the problems impeding the 
export process. 
  The chairman of the Federation of Industries, Muhammad Farid 
Khamis, believes that the problem centers on the endless 
procedures and fees, which increase export prices beyond what is 
competitive in foreign markets. Nonetheless, Muhammad Farid 
Khamis is optimistic about solving these problems after 
attending meetings chaired by President Mubarak, the prime 
minister, or other ministers, and attended by exporters and 
producers. 
  Muhammad Farid Khamis emphasizes that export has become a 
national goal, because of its effect on all domestic economic 
activities and its national role in balancing the trade balance 
and the balance of payments to move away from the indebtedness 
caused by the trade deficit. 
  Muhammad Farid Khamis states that the political leadership 
and the executive leadership are now taking up the cause of 
export and removing the constraints and complications that have 
limited export activity. They are also adopting a clearly 
defined and targeted export strategy for the present and future, 
which is based on the position of the national economy and the 
situation in international markets. 
  Muhammad Farid Khamis optimistic talk is based on his 
participation in plenary meetings or specialized committees in 
the ministries, which have prepared recommendations and 
submitted them to the political and executive leaders. 
  The chairman of the Federation of Banks, Mahmud 
'Abd-al-'Aziz, emphasizes the banking system's role in 
stimulating exports and providing essential services to 
exporters, the most important being the implementation of export 
credits, which totaled more than 6,000, valued at more than 10 
billion pounds during the past fiscal year. 
  The chairman of the Exhibitions and International Markets 
Authority, Hamid 'Atwah, calls for greater participation in 
international markets. State help, and greater help from the 
sector that produces for export, is needed to finance this 
participation and to set up exhibitions to introduce Egyptian 
products. 
  Dr. Madhat al-Juwayni, the head of the Trade Representation 
Agency, believes that it is necessary to support the agency and 
expand the trade representation in countries targeted by 
Egyptian exports and in countries whose markets we hope to enter 
to introduce them to Egyptian goods. Also commercial attaches 
should prepare reports and studies on opportunities for Egyptian 
exports in foreign markets. Such information is important to 
both the government and exporters and should be used by them. 
  Regarding exporters' complaints about export supervision 
agencies, Salah-al-Din 'Awad, the head of the General 
Supervisory Board for Exports and Imports, states that export 
supervision is to the exporters' advantage, because it ensures 
"quality." The authority also benefits agricultural exports 
through packing, sorting, and canning stations. In addition, it 
has scientific agencies, unparalleled in the Middle East, for 
monitoring incoming goods. 
  Salah 'Awad states: If there is a desire to eliminate 
supervision, nothing stands in the way. Just consider what 
happened in 1987, when we eliminated supervision of agricultural 
exports. These exports dropped from 94,000 tons to 64,000 tons, 
because a number of exporters did not maintain quality. 
Shipments were lost, and the national economy lost. 
  He adds: We have 20,000 exporters. Among them are honorable 
people. Also among them are people who are not up to par. They 
harm Egyptian products in foreign markets by exporting products 
that do not meet standards for quality. 
  Dr. Hazim al-Babilawi is the chairman of a bank which 
specializes in developing exports. He states his view on this 
vital issue as follows: Neglecting exports means greater 
reliance on imports, which increases our foreign debts. What is 
needed is an export strategy based on export industries, the 
elimination of bureaucratic and procedural barriers, the 
establishment of a database to determine trends in foreign 
markets, and the pursuit of a flexible domestic policy that 
takes into account continuous changes, with attention to 
reducing the cost of goods and maintaining quality, so that 
goods are competitive. 
  What are the problems facing the development of exports and 
their proposed solutions? 
  By tracking the reports and discussions of plenary 
committees 
or technical subcommittees, we can identify, define, and 
publicize these problems and their solutions. Such reports 
include those prepared by the Federation of Industries, the 
Federation of Chambers of Commerce, businessmen, the Trade 
Representation Agency, and the General Supervisory Board for 
Exports and Imports. All of these reports enable one to 
inventory these problems and to gather all of the proposed 
solutions as well as recommendations for now and the future. 
  The problems now affecting exporters concern the many 
burdens 
encumbering them. These burdens, which restrict our ability to 
increase Egyptian exports because they limit the competitiveness 
of those exports in foreign markets, include the following: 

  -  The lengthy documentation cycle required in the export 
process. Export procedures include more than 45 steps, which are 
implemented in more than one place. The integrated provision of 
services at one location is needed. 
  -  An abundance of forms and papers to be processed, difficulty 
in 
obtaining some of these forms and papers at times, and the need 
to process more than 15 documents between the certificate, form, 
license, request, invoice, and receipt. 
  -  A multiplicity of fees, stamps, and the equivalent of stamps 
collected under numerous names at airports, ports, and loading 
stations. These growing costs, which have become a real burden 
for exporters, ultimately affect the price of Egyptian goods. 
Eight types of fees are imposed under numerous names and 
headings. The state collects fees for services for which it, not 
the exporter, should pay, e.g., the fee for explosives detection. 
  -  The multiplicity of control processes. Shipments are 
inspected 
by the export supervision agencies and permits are issued for 
them. Agricultural shipments are then inspected by the 
agricultural quarantine agencies, which require additional forms 
and fees in order to issue an agricultural certificate. The 
Export Supervisory Board then requires additional applications 
to obtain a certificate of origin. 

    The committee formed by the economy and foreign trade 
minister to examine export problems has called for: reducing the 
number of steps required; seeking unconventional solutions to 
export barriers; freeing exports from all constraints; 
supporting and coordinating between export agencies and 
organizations; expediting the formation of a national high 
committee for exports; eliminating the monopoly in shipping 
services and exposing companies in the public business sector 
and private sector to competition, given the large disparity 
between the prices fixed for services at Egyptian airports and 
ports compared to the prices paid in other countries by 
exporters for such services, despite the lack of improvement in 
Egypt in these services and their prices, which have been rising 
since 1987; expediting promulgation of the Currency Law, whose 
draft is devoid of any requirement for the TS [expansion not 
given] Form, considered one of the greatest obstacles in export 
procedures. 
<H5>  55 Recommendations </H5>
  The technical committee formed to examine export problems 
has 
issued 55 recommendations, including 17 to the Economy Ministry, 
19 to the Finance Ministry, seven to the Agriculture Ministry, 
six to the Transport and Communications Ministry, two to the 
Industry Ministry, two to the prime minister, one to the 
Petroleum Ministry, one to the New Urban Communities Ministry, 
and one to the Electricity Ministry. 
  The report by the ministerial technical committee 
recommended 
that the Economy Ministry take several measures to help boost 
Egyptian exports, the most important being to: compensate 
exporters for the strength of the US dollar; reduce export 
service fees in governmental departments; provide low-interest 
financing for export activity; remedy debt problems with the 
banking system; lower the cost of banking services; exempt 
imports of raw materials for factories from export and import 
control measures; disburse incentives for exports amounting to 5 
to 20 percent of the value of the commodity exported, depending 
on its type; refrain from prohibiting the export of any good, 
lest it lose its position in world markets; permit the import of 
oil products for industrial use; establish an export support 
fund financed by a fee on imports; be satisfied with a single 
form, "Customs 13," to end all export procedures related to 
customs, agricultural quarantine, and export control. 
  The most important recommendations made to the Finance 
Ministry are to: exempt export activity from taxes for a defined 
period; stop deducting 1 percent of the proceeds of exports as a 
tax; eliminate the sales tax on machinery and spare parts, all 
requirements for stamps on export documents, and the 
proportional stamp tax on the capital of share companies; reduce 
customs on production inputs not produced in Egypt; implement a 
simple tax rebate system that returns to the exporter, after 
exportation is effected, customs and sales tax on imported 
components and services, fees, and different taxes; eliminate 
administrative fees and expenses imposed on industry under 
various headings; not permit the imposition of any burdens 
without the cabinet's consent; and include the members of the 
chambers of specialized industry in customs arbitration 
committees. 
  The recommendations made to the Agriculture Ministry are to: 
establish funds to balance agricultural produce prices to 
prevent producers from being hurt in the event of an abundant 
crop amid a slow world market; apply a strict agricultural cycle 
regarding several crops, the most important being potatoes; 
eliminate agricultural quarantine fees for exports; create a 
national project to combat pests and diseases; focus on the 
discovery of new breeds of high-yield, disease-resistant crop 
seeds. 
  The recommendations that must be implemented by the 
Transport 
and Communications Ministry are to: reduce the fees of shipping 
agencies, ports, and airports; reduce maritime and air freight 
charges; and systematically provide refrigerated containers for 
shipment of perishables to Arab, African, and European markets. 
The Federation of Industries recommended that the Petroleum 
Ministry lower fuel and energy prices with respect to exported 
goods. 
  The recommendations called on the Industry Ministry to 
review 
the standard specifications of exports issued by the General 
Standards Authority, and to limit compliance with standards to 
security and safety goods and injurious goods. 
  The prime minister was called upon to; ensure that no 
governmental agency would require fees of any type for export 
procedures, except for those defined previously in the unified 
fee; free all types of Egyptian commodities from any constraints 
stemming from requirements to obtain prior approvals from any 
agency regarding the type, quantity, or price of an export, as 
long as export of the good is permitted. 
  In view of the ongoing increases in energy prices, the 
Federation of Industries recommended that energy prices 
applicable to industrial activity be fixed for at least three 
years, and that a good pricing policy be formulated for energy 
consumption by factories.

  [Text] The Finance Ministry received the largest number of 
recommendations to remedy problems stemming from fees, customs, 
and stamps. Following a meeting last Wednesday evening, Finance 
Minister Muhammad al-Razzaz told me that he is in the service of 
the "exporters," because export has become a national strategy 
and a priority in the development plan. 
  The finance minister said that finance policy has been 
greatly concerned with promoting exports, making efforts to 
remove all barriers facing exporters, and eliminating or 
reducing burdens on exports. The Finance Ministry is remedying 
any problem impeding exports. The pertinent agencies, such as 
Customs and Sales Tax, now go to production sites at exporters' 
requests to effect customs procedures regarding exports. Also, 
warehouse construction is being expanded in new urban areas to 
simplify and facilitate measures, especially those concerning 
exports. 
  Recently, two resolutions were issued to overcome obstacles 
and relieve exporters. The first resolution was made following 
complaints regarding delays in exporters' receipt of rebates of 
customs and sales tax paid on exported goods which have been 
exported. Under this resolution, exporters will recover the 
customs and sales tax they pay on Egyptian exports through an 
immediate rebate system. This system dispenses with long waits 
and the requirement to submit documents. A committee has been 
formed in the Customs Agency to determine the customs and 
general sales tax that must be returned under this system. The 
committee is comprised of representatives of the Customs Agency, 
Sales Tax Agency, and the Industrial Supervisory Agency, and a 
member of the Federation of Industries appointed by the chairman 
of the board of the Federation of Egyptian Industries. 
  This committee will have a technical secretariat. The 
secretariat will receive requests and data from brand-name 
manufacturers who import production materials, produce products 
on production lines, and export these national products under 
the drawback system. The technical secretariat will study these 
requests and present them to a committee formed to determine the 
value of the customs and sales tax to be returned to each 
national producer who exports under this system. The taxes are 
then returned based on the export customs previously authorized 
by the committee. Exporters will thus not have to submit 
documents for each shipment separately. 
  The second resolution concerns reducing the burden of 
guaranties that must be provided for goods cleared to enter 
Egypt or be transported from one place to another under special 
regulations--which are the "temporary permission," "transit," 
"warehouses," and "temporary clearance (except for passenger 
vehicles)" regulations. The following guaranties can be provided 
in lieu of payment of customs and general sales tax: 

  -  Monetary security or bank guarantee. 
  -  Pledges of governmental ministries and agencies, and public 
authorities. 
  -  A guaranty document, equal in value to the taxes due, issued 
to 
the credit of, and callable by, the Customs Agency and the Sales 
Tax Agency. 

    Under the "temporary permission regulation," payment of 
taxes 
due can also be guaranteed by a declaration guaranteed by not 
more than 80 percent of the net worth of a firm's assets and 
subsidiaries according to its most recent authorized balance. 
  All of these measures are designed to reduce the burdens on 
exporters and thus enable them to stand up to foreign 
competition policies. 
  These facilities are not limited to exporters. The customs 
committees can implement procedures at production and loading 
sites based on the exporter's request. The commodity will be 
exported directly from the relevant customs house--without the 
repetition of customs measures with respect to it. This will be 
done in conjunction with the establishment of a centralized, 
specialized administration for temporary permission and 
drawback, and the shortening of procedures to recover fees, 
taking into account that exported commodities are not subject to 
the sales tax.

<F P=106> [Article by Ibrahim Nafi': "Unemployment Facts in Egypt; </F>
Accurate Figures, What is the Remedy?"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] What are the facts of the 
situation in Egypt? During the past three years, I have tried to 
obtain accurate figures on the size of unemployment in Egypt, as 
well as the type of unemployment. I have obtained judgements and 
estimates that do not inspire confidence, nor do they add 
anything to the already dissimilar numbers and varying 
estimates. Finally, I was asked to wait until registration was 
completed, which is the first count of the unemployed in 
cooperation between national and international experts. Finally, 
last week, I received a report on the results of the 
compilation, done by the cabinet's data center in all 
governorates, in cooperation with the Ministries of Local 
Administration and Manpower and Employment. It is a report that 
contains most the important and precise details, since the 
program used to prepare it confirms results reached through 
scientific impartiality and tells the truth about the facts of 
the issue. 
  1. Fact No. 1: This report gives us a sound basis for 
objective dialogue and puts the true scope of the problem 
squarely before us. It also presents extremely important data 
for each Egyptian individual and family. It must attract the 
attention of intellectuals, experts, businessmen, and the 
ministry responsible for workers and labor, which is the 
Ministry of Manpower and Employment. I ask the reader's 
permission to present this data, as it came in this report: 

  -  Number of those entering the labor market between 1982 and 
1993, and who are seeking work...4,841,000 
  -  Number of those trained for their jobs...3,415,887 
  -  Total number of unemployed university and school graduates, 
who 
graduated between 1984 and 1993...1,425,113 
  -  Percentage of those within the labor force...9.2 
  -  Majority having mid-level qualifications...1,098,909 
  -  Majority located in rural areas...1,007,356 
  -  31 percent of unemployed are married, and majority of them 
are 
female, or are males who have temporary jobs...435,066 

    2. Fact No. 2: The real size of the problem, and what must 
be 
dealt with, is the 990,047 persons who are looking for jobs. The 
other part includes females who are married and want to work, 
i.e., they have a family and, consequently, their need for work 
is less than the need of others. Despite being close to 1 
million, the number is completely at variance with the 
philosophical judgements and claims to knowledge of those who, 
for a long time, persisted in estimating that unemployment in 
Egypt had reached several millions. I do not want to belittle 
the size of the problem, but I also would like to put it in its 
true perspective. I am pleased that I am the first to 
participate, through the al-AHRAM organization, in the call to 
formulate programs to ensure the reduction of this number to a 
few thousand, and to participate in implementing these programs. 
I believe that together--government, business organizations, 
banks, trade unions, and intellectuals--we can formulate these 
programs, arrange the funding required for them, and implement 
them efficiently. Yes, all of us, if our intentions are sincere, 
can put this issue on the agenda of all our leadership councils. 
All of us must take part in resolving this problem. 
  All of us are responsible; the government is responsible for 
operating the largest possible number of training centers, and 
for giving direct incentives to those who absorb the unemployed. 
Economic and service projects are responsible for expanding 
their activities, opening new markets for their products, and 
increasing use of capabilities available to them. Young people 
are also responsible. They must accept jobs that may not be 
compatible with their academic qualifications. They must be 
persuaded that appropriate qualification is that qualification 
that is needed and demanded by the market, and not necessarily 
the qualification that they chose during their education. 
  3. Fact No. 3: For well-known reasons, the largest part of 
unemployment is in rural areas. The most important reasons are: 
the graduates' aversion to working in the fields after they are 
educated; decisive expansion in machine use, in order to 
increase production; and, limited growth in agricultural 
production and certain integrated, peripheral activities. 
  The clear consequence of all this is the decisive need to 
think about the future of Egypt's rural development, since it is 
impossible to continue economic activities in a large number of 
governorates that are restricted to agriculture. That will lead 
to keeping the unemployed without work and will add to their 
number new thousands of those who have had opportunities for 
education and whose residence is in rural areas. 
  Yes, it is impossible to continue the course of development 
as it is now in rural areas. There are certain successful 
experiences in the world at this time with regard to 
diversifying economic activities in the countryside, using 
agricultural activity as a springboard for other activities. 
Experiences in Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China deserve 
close study. Therefore, I call on the government to form a team 
of national experts who have had previous experience in the 
business sector, and task them with going to these countries, 
studying their experiences in comprehensive rural development, 
obtaining all necessary details, and absorbing possible lessons 
from these experiences. They should then formulate programs that 
could be implemented in Egypt, defining the mechanisms of 
implementation, resources required, and appropriate sources for 
these resources. 
  4. Fact No. 4: Those with middle-level qualifications 
represent the largest part of those seeking work (77 percent of 
the total unemployed). 
  This clearly means that the market does not need their 
skills. It is also clear that the holder of an industrial 
diploma has not been trained to be a craftsman. The holder of a 
commercial diploma has not been qualified to be a skilled 
specialist in financial and accounting matters. The holder of 
the skills acquired with an agricultural diploma is limited to 
working agricultural jobs. If it is necessary to keep this kind 
of education, it will be necessary to change the content and 
method of preparation. The change should be radical. We all know 
that this is not an easy matter. It requires time and resources. 
However, we also know that keeping the situation as it is at 
present is no longer acceptable. Every lesson learned from the 
preceding experience of other countries tells us that they 
abandoned the kind of education that is applied in Egypt, and 
replaced it with vocational training. This vocational education 
gives only one day of class work to every five days of practical 
experience, that is training in the work place. Egyptian 
education and instructional experts should repeatedly visit 
those countries, in order to create a plan to introduce the 
desired developments into our curricula in these schools and 
vocational training programs. 
  I would also like to see intensified activity to breathe 
life 
into the nearly 450 training centers scattered throughout Egypt, 
although the data available to me confirms that the biggest part 
of them need radical development of their capabilities and 
administration. Training technical cadres is one of the 
principal pivotal points on the road to reducing unemployment. 
We must give it special importance and maximum priority in our 
concerns. The current picture needs changing. The time has come 
to attract special attention from the ministers of industry and 
the labor force. 
  The problem is urgent and its remedy requires both time and 
money. Our sincere efforts on a sound basis will achieve 
tangible results toward controlling the problem and limiting it. 
Everyone must cooperate to attain this major goal. 
  I repeat once more: everyone, not just the government alone, 
but also professional and labor organizations, investors, young 
people searching for work who must develop their abilities, and 
people of vision and ideas concerned with political and party 
action. 
  Everyone is a partner in this responsibility; the issue is 
everyone's issue, and not the issue of the government alone or 
of any specific quarter.

  [Text] Three out of four Arabs support immediate military 
confrontation with Israel while the fourth prefers to maintain 
the current situation of neither peace nor war while awaiting a 
time when the Arabs will be able to realize their goals. This is 
the conclusion drawn from a study recently published in MIDDLE 
EAST QUARTERLY. The scholar who conducted the study, which 
included 1,000 Lebanese, Syrian, and Palestinian Muslims outside 
Israel, warns that Arab leaders foresee the danger of 
delegitimization by their people, who lag behind them in their 
policies toward Israel. 
  Professor Hilal Qashan of the American University in Beirut 
found that, on the eve of the signing of the agreement between 
Israel and the PLO at the White House, none of those surveyed 
could find a single positive aspect to peace with Israel. The 
most common opinion was that peace is a temporary tactic 
designed to enable the Arabs to reorganize themselves in order 
to strike at Israel at some later time. Of those questioned who 
supported peace, 90 percent said that they would withdraw their 
support for it if Israel were to weaken in the future. The 
scholar concludes that his findings teach that even they do not 
support a lasting peace. 
  Writing in the WALL STREET JOURNAL, Qashan states that the 
Arab public's desire to launch an immediate war against Israel 
indicates an anomaly in the findings, for if the Arabs failed to 
wipe out Israel when superpower polarization was at its peak, it 
is irrational to believe that they can succeed at a time when 
just one superpower exists. He concludes from his survey 
findings that the Arabs--including those who support peace--are 
not psychologically ready for this change. The respondents 
expressed fear that peace would enable Israel to become the 
leading economic power of the Middle East and to gain a larger 
share of the region's water sources. Many of the respondents 
blame Israel for instigating the civil war in Lebanon, inciting 
the clash with the Qurds in northern Iraq and aggravating the 
rebellion in southern Sudan. They believe in the existence of a 
grand Zionist conspiracy to create "ministates" to take the 
place of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Egypt. 
  The respondents--two-thirds of them engaged in the liberal 
professions--reveal a very faulty conception of the meaning of 
peace and its benefits. A majority sees it as surrender and 
prefers to continue the confrontation with Israel. According to 
the study, Arab political culture still harbors strong 
anti-Israel sentiments. 
  Qashan blames Arab leaders for educating their people to 
distrust Jews, hate Zionists, and dream of destroying Israel. 
When they decided to open negotiations with Israel, Qashan 
notes, they did not properly prepare their public for what might 
ensue. The Arab public feels abandoned by its leaders and 
bypassed by modernization and political liberalism. Nonetheless, 
he believes that true peace can be achieved if Arab leaders 
undertake a new process of socialization in the Arab public. He 
calls on the United States to make a contribution by promoting 
mutual interaction, cooperation and understanding so that peace 
will stand on its own.

  [Text] The Haredi journals HAMODI'A, YATED NE'EMAN, and 
SHAS' [Torah Observing Sephardim] YOM LEYOM, covered Israeli 
independence day in their weekend issues. Each of them, in its 
own way, took pains to emphasize its estrangement from the state 
while critically judging those "religious Zionists" who behave 
as if the state were the first step towards redemption. It is 
not merely that the state cannot be viewed as the start of 
redemption, they stressed, but that the opposite is true. As 
HAMODI'A put it, "This is the worst diaspora." 
  HAMODI'A filled an entire page with three articles ticking 
off the evils of the Zionist state. In this they seemed to glory 
in vindictive satisfaction. This state, one of the articles 
proclaimed, is incapable of assuring the peace and safety of its 
citizens. It depends on the views of others. What is more, it 
even eradicates "Jewish roots." The joy of independence is not 
their joy. And as in the past, this year, too, they have 
expressed their opinion that the Jewish state, which arose 
miraculously after 2,000 years of exile, is not be seen as the 
end of exile and the start of redemption. 
  Indeed, one of the authors makes an effort to emphasize that 
his commentary cannot be understood as "schadenfreude" unless it 
is taken, as it must be in these times, as the soul searching of 
a Jew. To prove that we are not safe in this land, he mentions 
the attacks in Afula, Hadera, and other places around the 
country that have claimed the lives of more than a prayer quorum 
of innocent Jews. 
  We read in YATED NE'EMAN, among other things, that: "The 
grand vision promoted by the Zionists and the various religious 
nationalists of Israel as the safe haven where Jewish blood will 
no longer be spilled, as they have put it, has been utterly 
shattered, almost obliterated. Most unfortunately, today, more 
so than other time since the founding of the state, they 
themselves see the great lie that they have made of the reality 
and existence of the state. This fact gives us great joy, for 
exposure of the lie is essential to recognizing the truth. This 
day, independence day, is appropriate to [text illegible] in our 
hearts, for if the day shall come when a new idolatry arises in 
a different guise, they will not pursue it and be seduced into 
becoming complete fools." 
  In an editorial on independence day, YATED NE'EMAN also 
called on its readers not to rely on the security of the state 
or its independence since it is neither secure nor independent 
and its behavior, of course, is alien to the spirit of Judaism. 
  SHAS' organ, YOM LEYOM, treated the state in the same vein. 
We read in one of its editorials that: "Despite the hopes placed 
in it by its founders, it has not succeeded in solving the 
problems of the Jewish people. It sought to create a land in 
which Jews would be able to live their lives independent of 
outsiders. But that has not happened. On the contrary, Jewish 
lives in the state of Israel are more at risk than are the lives 
of Jews in other countries.... Accordingly, we must recognize 
that the diaspora still continues in all its aching force 
notwithstanding the founding of the state. Until the advent of 
redemption, there is nothing for us to do but try to protect 
Jewish lives, even at the painful price of yielding the 
territories." 
  On the same page of YATED NE'EMAN, there appeared an article 
under the headline, "Some Celebration, Some Independence." The 
author ridicules not only the celebration of independence but 
the state itself. Referring to the prayer for the peace of the 
state, he glibly asserts that "Whoever blesses the national 
government, its ministers and advisers each Sabbath, in fact, is 
blessing Shulamit Aloni, Amnon Rubenstein, Shim'on Peres, Yosi 
Beilin and their colleagues and advisers.... Even these 
last-named Zionists are now confounded by this land. So who is 
it, exactly, who is celebrating independence here?" The author 
also has something to say about standing at attention for the 
siren blast in memory of the soldiers who fell in the line of 
duty. In his view, "The state established the siren as a form of 
identification, but it is a ritual void of any substance or 
meaning...." As to the Jewish character of Israel and the 
state's relationship to Torah life, he writes that one can learn 
from the media, the Knesset, the courts, the street and every 
stone and wall. He notes desecrations of the Sabbath, violations 
of kashrut, a decline in Jewish Torah education and so on. 
  In short, there is no room for Jews who observe Torah and 
the 
commandments to identify with the state. 
  These are harsh words but the author, with all due respect, 
apparently forgot to add that his movement, SHAS, is an active 
partner in this anti-Jewish, antireligious government, and has 
prevented it from falling and being replaced by another 
government that would be more Jewish, more religious, etc. 
  We read these articles in three newspapers, two of them 
dressed in very Haredi garb and the third in the clothing of a 
community becoming just as orthodox. To tell the truth, we were 
not surprised by what we read. This is not the first time that 
Agudat Yisra'el in its two incarnations and SHAS have not 
identified with the state of Israel. They treat it as they do 
any diaspora. They never have a kind word to say in praise of 
the state that arose by the grace of God after 2,000 years of 
exile. They also deliberately ignore that the founding of the 
state triggered a great turnabout to the benefit of Jewish life 
in Israel and the communities of the diaspora. It has become a 
defender for untold thousands of Jews in foreign countries and 
has even rescued many from the attacks of anti-Semites seeking 
to raise their hands against Jewish lives. Not only that, but 
also despite the state's continuing war against terrorists and 
the enemies around us, there is no better and safer place for 
Jews today than in this country. 
  For all the criticism of what has happened in Israel, no one 
can overlook the flourishing Torah education to which we have 
been witness, the dissemination of Torah sources to thousands of 
Israelis and everything else that instills pride in a religious 
person in Israel. 
  Only the blind cannot see all this and, instead of blessing 
the creation of the state of Israel as the beginning of our 
redemption, raise their hands against the state of the Jews and 
treat it as they would the exile of the Jews. 
  Even if we continue to pray for the redemption of all 
Israel, 
God forbid that we should be grateful and offer up a blessing 
for the beginning of our redemption or make a prayer of 
thanksgiving that, by the grace of heaven, we have been 
delivered from the bonds of exile and, as free men, built a new 
home in the land bequeathed to our forefathers. 
  We have no illusions that the haredim, including SHAS, will 
change their minds and admit that what they have said is wrong. 
Even so, it is worth reminding them that, by the lives they have 
chosen to live, they have forgotten the words of the great sages 
on the subject of lepers, warning against speaking evil of any 
son of Israel. These reproaches are seven times truer when it is 
a matter of repudiating and slandering not just the state of 
Israel but those who believe in it and each day offer up anew a 
blessing on the start of the redemption of the people of Israel 
in the land of Israel.

<F P=106> [Article by Rut Yuval] </F>
  [Text] For Rabbi Menahem Hacohen, the band of armed 
brigands who holed up in Beit Yihud at the direction of Rabbi 
'Uzi Meshulam stirred up a pain that had subsided in recent 
years. Meshulam, says Hacohen, who once served in the Knesset, 
is the best proof of the need for a law prescribing who may call 
himself rabbi. "If 'Uzi Meshulam were just 'Uzi Meshulam, the 
shame and the anger would be enough, but since he carries the 
title rabbi, that adds a dimension to the whole thing." 
  Hacohen tried twice in the past to push through a bill to 
regulate this unholy domain. Twice the religious ministers and 
jurists blocked his bill. He has been caused anguish and rage 
countless times when "all sorts of men who are as far from the 
rabbinate as north is from south" have been presented or have 
presented themselves as rabbis. 
  The founding of the state is usually marked as the starting 
point for inflation in use of the title rabbi. Some ascribe this 
to the rise in the number of seminaries. For lack of any other 
proper title, seminary teachers are called "rabbis," and from 
the moment they could obtain the title even without ordination 
examinations or a practice period (a sort of working 
apprenticeship for congregational rabbis that was customary in 
the larger communities), the fence was breached. Rabbi Hacohen 
sees two catalysts for the process: the ignorance of secular 
Jews and the pursuit of trappings of respect by the religious. 
Most people in the secular media do not know how to tell a rabbi 
from a mezuzah salesman, but the beard, the black frock, and the 
hat arouse in them a murmur of respect for the spirit of 
grandfather's Israel (and sometimes even for a faint memory of 
their father's house where, in the Yiddish style, the word "reb" 
preceded every man's name). In that way, the title rabbi began 
to be given in Israel, too, as a mark of courtesy to anyone who 
served in public office and looked like a rabbi, with or without 
any connection to rabbinic ordination. 
  In their wake came the religious media, particularly the 
haredi, which found in it a means of honoring its worthies and 
denigrating its foes. Agudat Yisra'el's journal HAMODI'A has 
never used the title rabbi before the name of Shlomo Goren, whom 
they detest, even though Goren is a completely legitimate rabbi; 
exceptionally polite writers call him Mr. Shlomo Goren. In Degel 
Hatorah's YATED NE'EMAN, he is called "rabbi" only in quotations 
when, as often happens, his name is accompanied by the words 
"buffoon" and "ignoramus." By contrast, every fourth rank party 
activist, and even anyone who has gotten a few inches of column 
space in advertisements, receives the honorific "rabbi" without 
the slightest difficulty in both newspapers. 
  Menahem Hacohen was elected to the Knesset in 1973. "I 
recall 
at least six rabbis there, of whom only two were real rabbis: 
Rabbi Kalman Kahane and 'Avdakh. All the rest, `Rabbi' Grus, 
`Rabbi' Scheinman, `Rabbi' Porush and `Rabbi' Abramowitz, were 
what I called `rebraff.' After that, there was `Rabbi' Lorenz 
and `Rabbi' Verdiger and still others, and each had a frock. The 
title rabbi stuck and they like it. Even today, the Knesset has 
some men who call themselves `rabbi' but who have never gotten a 
whiff of what it means to study Torah." 
  Early in his career, Hacohen thought he could change things. 
"Like any young Jew entering the Knesset, I thought the world 
could be fixed. I said to myself, `This is a rotten business, 
anyone can call himself rabbi if he wants. It is charlatanism, 
just plain fraud. Just as a physician cannot call himself a 
doctor if he is not a doctor, a rabbi who is not ordained as a 
rabbi cannot call himself rabbi. The situation has gotten to the 
point where it is beginning to be a title of contempt.' I 
thought that just as we need to regulate any title, we have to 
protect the title rabbi, and for that you need a law. 
  "I never imagined that someone could be against such a law. 
But every proposed bill goes through a coalition screening, and 
the coalition leadership was against it. Zerah Verhaftig, who 
was then Minister of Religious Affairs, and Justice Minister 
Ya'aqov Shimshon Shapira told me they were against it. The 
second time I presented the bill, the Minister of Religious 
Affairs was Yitzhaq Rafa'el, who held it and held it and held 
it. Eventually, the Justice Minister, Hayim Tzadoq, told me that 
he was against passing it." 
  [Yuval] Why was it that this bill aroused opposition? 
  [Hacohen] First of all, it could have caused problems for 
the 
government with various factions because it raised the question 
of how to deal with the Reform and Conservative movements. I 
said, `You cannot discriminate on this. If it is a movement that 
ordains rabbis, even if it is Reform, then you cannot take away 
his title.' But the Ministry of Religious Affairs was afraid of 
the problems that the entire process would create. The second 
reason for opposition was the idea, why should they complicate 
things with all sorts of Jews, both abroad and in the Knesset 
itself, who were happy with the situation? After all, there were 
men of all kinds calling themselves rabbi in the government and 
in the coalition. 
  "I really do not know just how much of a rabbi Menahem 
Hacohen is," snickers Knesset member [MK] Avraham Ravitz of 
Degel Hatorah, and his snicker reveals something of the 
basically problematic nature of the issue. "I am not speaking of 
him personally, I do not know his past, but a man has to be 
tested in certain subjects to be ordained a rabbi. Now, it 
happens that there are rabbis in the community who are students 
of brilliant sages but who have not gone to the trouble of 
taking tests in these subjects because--it can even be matter of 
principle, they are modest and humble--they did not want to have 
the title and do not need it to get a rabbinic position. But 
they can still be far greater masters than Menahem Hacohen, for 
instance. Again, I am speaking of Menahem Hacohen as an example, 
not personally. 
  "Look, we have levels upon levels determined according to a 
man's knowledge and his moral character. We call both Rabbi 
Elishav and Menahem Hacohen rabbi, but they are not on the same 
level. It is like an elephant compared to a fly. I could tell 
you that Rabbi Schach did not receive a rabbinic ordination; 
does that mean he is not a Torah genius and we cannot call him 
rabbi? And let us say that 'Uzi Meshulam brings me 20 rabbinic 
degrees; I will tell him to cover himself with them on a night 
when it is 20 degrees. That is all. None of us here will call 
him rabbi." 
  The problems that secular Jews have in dealing with the 
question of "who is a rabbi" are hardly less troubling for them 
than they are for the haredim. True, Rabbi Ravitz contends that 
for both him and the entire haredi community, "We know exactly 
who is a rabbi and who is not, and believe me, it is so clear 
and easy that I would almost say it is an exact science." Even 
he, however, finds himself getting tripped up when he tries to 
define who is a rabbi by ordination and who is a rabbi by earned 
respect. 
  Ravitz: "I will give you myself as an example. I studied for 
dozens of years in two seminaries but I never bothered to join 
the rabbinate even though that would have been as easy for me as 
breakfast. One day I was offered a rabbinic position and I 
debated whether or not to take it. In the end, I did not take 
it, but in the meantime, I went and got a rabbinic ordination, 
which took me exactly two weeks. Does that mean I was not a 
rabbi two weeks earlier and two weeks later I was? None of my 
colleagues has any idea that I got a rabbinic ordination. I do 
not hang the certificate in my office because it is not our 
custom to do that. We do not have any interest in that." 
  [Yuval] So how do you know how to tell who is a rabbi? 
  [Ravitz] There are two ways: by knowledge of Torah and by 
the 
man's moral character and judgment. 
  [Yuval] Are Ori Zohar and Mordekhay Arnon rabbis by your 
definition? 
  [Ravitz] It is hard for me to give you an exact answer. I 
think that Ori, who has immersed himself in Torah for many 
years, definitely can be called Rabbi Ori Zohar even though he 
has not passed his ordination examinations. Perhaps Mordekhay 
Arnon, too, even though he deals more with day to day affairs. 
You see, I am starting to get tangled, but this does not 
interest us very much and does not bother us. 
  [Yuval] Do you call Moshe Hayrash Mantori a rabbi? 
  [Ravitz] Despite all the sharp disagreements I have with 
him, 
I think it is possible to call him rabbi, because it seems to me 
that he is a man who has studied for many years. 
  [Yuval] Arye Der'i? 
  [Ravitz] I do not know, it may be that he has an ordination. 
He is no ignoramus, Arye, he studied for many years. 
  [Yuval] When you meet him, do you call him Rabbi Arye Der'i? 
  [Ravitz] When we happen to meet, in the Knesset, for 
example, 
I call him Arye, but when I appear before SHAS [Torah Observing 
Sephardim] members and I know that they call him Rabbi Der'i, I 
call him that too. 
  [Yuval] Is Avraham Shapira a rabbi? 
  [Ravitz] I really do not know. 
  [Yuval] It seems that even for all of you, there is some 
confusion over the rabbinic qualifications of some rabbis. 
  [Ravitz] Do you know what we do to get out of this? We call 
Shapira Reb Avrom. "Reb" is a kind of compromise. Reb Shmilqa, 
for instance, is what I call Shmu'el Halpert. 
  [Yuval] Even Halpert is not a rabbi? 
  [Ravitz] No, no. 
  "I am a rabbi, of course," MK Halpert says of himself. He, 
too, vigorously supports Menahem Hacohen's old bill. "In my 
opinion, only someone who has been ordained as a rabbi by the 
chief rabbinate is entitled to be called rabbi." 
  [Yuval] Menahem Hacohen thinks that only someone who will 
actually work as a rabbi can carry the title. 
  [Halpert] Not just practicing rabbis. It is enough that they 
have a rabbi's diploma. If someone passes his bar exams but does 
not practice law, can he not be called a lawyer? 
  [Yuval] Did you serve as a rabbi? 
  [Halpert] For a very short time, very briefly. 
  [Yuval] Do you know which Knesset members are ordained 
rabbis? 
  [Halpert] More or less. 
  [Yuval] Is Rafa'el Pinhasi a rabbi? 
  [Halpert] I do not know. 
  [Yuval] Is Menahem Porush a rabbi? 
  [Halpert] He has an ordination. Yes, absolutely. 
  According to Rabbi Halpert's information, MK Rafa'el Pinhasi 
is not a rabbi, and neither is Menahem Porush, at least not in 
the sense of having authority to decide questions of religious 
law or, as he puts it, "I do not have the highest level of 
certification, although what I know from my studies in the 
seminary is far greater than that of other people who did not 
study. And I will tell you something else. Some of the great 
seminary heads, people who were giants of Torah, were not 
qualified at the highest level. I do not want to mention names, 
but when one of the giants of the generation wanted to pronounce 
judgment at home on some matter, he would go to the city rabbi, 
who was far below him in Torah learning. 
  [Yuval] Do you feel it is important whether someone bears 
the 
title of a qualified rabbi? 
  [Halpert] No, by no means. 
  'Eli'ezer Mizrahi also does not put much stock in 
ordination. 
"There are some people who have not received ordination but know 
more even than rabbis. There are some people whom I call rabbi 
because I know them, just as if they had rabbinic ordination. 
You can learn a lot from them. 
  [Yuval] Are you qualified at the highest level? 
  [Mizrahi] I am on the way, as they say. If I had really 
wanted to be a rabbi, I might have made the effort to enter an 
institution where you have the time. But at this point, I think 
I will continue my political life. 
  There are three points of convergence, de facto or de jure, 
among all the rabbis interviewed. First, all of them answered as 
a matter of course to the title "rabbi" attached to their names 
and none of them corrected the speaker. The reason, apparently, 
was the one given by MK Pinhasi: "In practice, we use the title 
rabbi as a mark of honor and respect. The way secular Jews say 
`the esteemed' or `sir,' haredi Jews follow the custom of saying 
`rabbi.' That does not necessarily mean that he has received 
rabbinic ordination." Second, most of them commented that, at 
least at the start of their public careers, they did not feel at 
ease being called rabbi, and that includes ordained rabbis like 
Avraham Ravitz. "When I entered the Knesset, I thought, why 
should I suddenly start this practice? Look, Efra'im Sneh, to 
give an example, does not say that he is Dr. Sneh, but Dr. Yoram 
Los does do that. Some people need to show off their title but I 
did not feel that I had to do that." 
  More understandable is the uneasiness felt by honorary 
rabbis 
such as Rafa'el Pinhasi. "For me, it was very upsetting when I 
entered the Knesset and they began calling me rabbi. I even went 
and asked rabbis what to do about being given a title that I did 
not deserve. The rabbis told me, `It is not your honor, it is 
the public's; whoever leads it gets the title rabbi to 
distinguish him from an ordinary man.'" 
  One other common point: None of those interviewed knew 
whether MK Avraham Porush was an ordained rabbi. In fact, "MK 
Shapira passed his exams and received rabbinic ordination," 
reports Arye Frankel, Shapira's media adviser. "Shapira did not 
want to be called rabbi," he emphasized, "perhaps because he 
also felt the subject is one of utter chaos, so that anyone who 
wants a title can come and take it. Or it might be because he 
comes from the business world, where a title is not important. I 
doubt that he sits and fasts because people call him rabbi, but 
he does not feel it is right." 
  This situation, in which everyone has taken a short cut to 
make himself rabbi and there is no longer any need to work for 
the honor, has annoyed and frustrated many people, none more so 
than those in the national religious camp. In the absence of the 
proper outfit, no one thought to call them rabbi. In fact, the 
only ones in this camp to be honored with the title rabbi by the 
media were thrust into their roles by virtue of their status as 
rabbis, such as Rabbi Hayim Druckman. 
  The NRP [National Religious Party] was ready to forgo its 
honor when some interviewer on the "Mabat" news program did not 
use the title rabbi with MK Zevulun Hamer even though his 
rabbinic training did not fall below that of MK Menahem Porush, 
who was presented right after him as Rabbi Porush. But that 
almost no secular reporter refers to MK Yitzhaq Levy by the 
title that is rightfully his as a rabbi who runs an important 
seminary, that was too much. It is no accident that most of the 
wisecracks and bickering over the growing number of "rabbis" 
come from the national religious camp. "He gave you a multitude 
like weeds," they say about the phenomenon. [sentence as 
published] 
  Curiously, the definition of who is a rabbi at some point 
has 
also concerned the secularists, who saw the title rabbi as a 
sort of seal of moral standards. HA'OLAM HAZEH, fearlessly and 
impartially, used to lock horns with Rabbi Me'ir Kahane over his 
bona fides as a rabbi and even took pains to place the title in 
quotation marks when it wrote about him. At the same time, MK 
El'azar Granot of MAPAM [United Workers' Party] would point to 
Kahane on the Knesset rostrum and taunt him, "You are no rabbi." 
  The racist Kahane, however, was an ordained rabbi from an 
accredited institution, just as one-time prisoner Hayim Pardes, 
who was convicted of indecent acts, is an ordained rabbi held in 
high regard by his congregation. The years have made clear that 
a rabbinic degree is no guarantee against sin. "Rabbis are 
swindlers and rabbis are rapists and rabbis are thieves," Rabbi 
Hacohen ironically describes the decline in the value of the 
title. "Now there is no respect even for rabbis who are not 
caught in such misconduct." 
  No one today is seriously considering a law that would ban 
the indiscriminate use of the title rabbi. The secular media and 
public no longer get excited over whether one public figure or 
another is truly a rabbi, and the religious media and public 
unerringly know who is a rabbi and who is not; if necessary, the 
religious press helps its readers understand how people are to 
be called. When everyone became a rabbi (aside from Rabbi 
Goren), the religious press was compelled to be creative and 
only genuine rabbis earned the expanded title "genius rabbi." 
But inflation is a difficult process to stamp out, and within a 
short time, every neighborhood rabbi became a genius rabbi. So 
the [religious] press, seeking to maintain a hierarchy of 
respect, introduced a new title: the rabbi genius. Then further 
steps were added to the ladder, the "master genius," "our 
teacher" and the greatest of all, "our teacher the genius," but 
they all come back to the same place. Secular Jews will always 
think that a bearded man wearing a black hat is a great rabbi of 
the Torah, and the religious will forever distinguish between an 
important rabbi, a more important rabbi, a plain old rabbi on 
the newspaper page and Shlomo Goren.

  [Excerpt] [Word indistinct] May 5 (MAP) -- Algeria's recent 
decision to resume assistance to the `Polisario' [Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro] gang 
claiming the independence of the Sahara deals a serious blow to 
Maghreban unity and sows the grains of [words indistinct] 
instability in the region, wrote Moroccan daily BAYANE AL YAWM. 
For the daily of the Party for Progress and Socialism 
(PPS/leftist opposition) such a decision is a blatant evidence 
that Algeria is undermining the settlement process of the Sahara 
issue and the UN efforts as well. 
  Referring to JEUNE AFRIQUE weekly which reported in its 
latest issue that Algeria had recently [resumed] supplying 
weapons and spare parts to the `Polisario', the daily noted that 
that news was circulated immediately after the statements of the 
Algerian ambassador to Madrid and the threat to resort again to 
armed struggle against Morocco voiced lately by [Polisario 
leader] Mohamed Abdelaziz. [passage omitted containing

  [Text] London, Apr. 20 (MAP) -- In an exclusive interview 
with the London-based monthly EUROMONEY, Moroccan Finance 
Minister Mohamed Sagou outlined the four principal themes that 
dominates his thinking. In the interview to be published in 
the May's magazine supplement, the minister talked about the 
Moroccan Government's policy to restructure and modernize 
economy, fiscal and monetary policies, relations with the 
European Union [EU], the privatisation program and moves to 
create more job opportunities. To a question on the state's 
priorities to restructure and modernize its economy, the finance 
minister listed four priorities: The state's new role [words 
indistinct] the economy, speeding up the liberalization of the 
financial sector to become more competitive and attractive to 
the European Union's partners and social problems, particularly 
unemployment, in addition to the acceleration of new policy of 
taking many state-financed activities off-budget. 
  The minister also explained that a new strategy has been 
devised to deal with social problems and that the government is 
ready to make some concessions as long as they don't threaten 
the basic stability Morocco has attained. 
  On relations with the European Union, Sagou pointed out that 
two-thirds of Morocco's foreign trade is conducted with the EU 
and 800,000 Moroccan migrant workers--80 percent of the 
total--are employed there. Similarly, 80 percent of all foreign 
investment in Morocco comes from EU countries. 
  In northern Morocco, especially around Tangier, he 
explained, 
Spanish companies have established assembly plants comparable to 
the U.S. enterprises operating just south of the Mexican border. 
He however conceded that the GATT agreement might threaten 
Morocco's relatively privileged position with the European Union 
by effectively enabling other countries to export to the EU 
under the same conditions. 
  To a question voicing fears that the quest to attract 
foreign 
investment may open the way to undue foreign ownership and 
influence, the Moroccan minister answered that right now only 4 
percent of Morocco's gross capital formation is of foreign 
provenance. We have a comfortable absorptive margin for the 
next ten years, though in sectors like banking and insurance 
foreign interests can already acquire control of [word 
indistinct] enterprises, he added. 
  On the Kingdom's fiscal system and the informal sector, he 
said personal and corporate tax rates have been reduced for four 
or five years, and over the next four or five years, individuals 
and companies will be encouraged to declare their tax liability. 
But viewed pragmatically, the informal economy is creating jobs 
and wealth, he explained. 
  To a question on how the government will simultaneously 
finance increased social spending and reduce tax revenues, 
without plunging the state's finances back into serious deficit, 
he replied that "global budget deficit is only about 2.2 percent 
of gross domestic product against 13 percent in 1983. 
  In figures it amounts to around USD 600 million, a mere USD 
25 million over last year. We are confident that lower taxes 
will actually increase fiscal revenues by encouraging more 
people to pay up, and by increasing company profits in the long 
term. Receipts from privatisation sales will also bridge the 
gap, though that is not the motive behind our privatisation 
campaign. We are prepared to seek external financing but only 
for the private sector. 
  The government has declined offers from London and New York 
bankers to raise loans in excess of USD 100 million, and 
suggested they fund our private sector instead. Growth will 
bring in revenue long term, and in the short term we shall 
proceed cautiously step by step with necessary fiscal expansion. 
Meanwhile, we hope to get the private sector to take more of 
the budgetary strain in sectors like agriculture, energy, 
infrastructure and even education. In areas like public 
housing, which we shall continue to subsidize, falling interest 
rates will lessen the state's burden. 
  The minister outlined that the biggest problem is creating 
more jobs for Moroccan growing population and bringing down 
unemployment, a problem which solution he described as "the key 
to everything."

  [Text] Rabat, May 3 (MAP) -- The Moroccan human rights 
organization, `OMDH' said it will extend its action to encompass 
also the defense of economic, social and cultural rights, mainly 
the right to work, unionist rights and the defense of the press 
freedom. 
  President of the organization Abdelaziz Bennani said Monday 
at a news conference economic, cultural and social rights are 
intrinsically linked to civil and political rights and the OMDH 
has received several complaints from citizens citing violations 
of these rights, mainly the right to work and unionist rights. 
  The OMDH president added he notified to the authorities 
reports of violations of these rights but received no answer. 
The organization has also compiled several reports on abuses 
harming economic, social and cultural rights which are mainly 
noted in the practice of the right to unionist activities as 
several complaints that reached the organization cited 
restrictions of this right. Bennani also deplored that the 
government's commitments vis-a-vis this right are not observed. 
  Concerning the right to work, the OMDH president said 
violations in this regard are reflected by collective laying 
down of workers, precarious jobs and the non-enforcement of the 
minimum guaranteed salary by employers. He said the government 
should shoulder its responsibilities in the respect of labor 
rights which are regulated by texts that date back to the 
protectorate era. 
  On the occasion of the celebration this May 3 of the world 
press freedom day, the OMDH made public a statement pointing out 
that recommendations of the national colloquy on information and 
communication which called for the setting forth of an 
information and communication strategy based on freedom of 
speech and the democratization of the media were not respected. 
The OMDH calls the legislative body to set in motion 
recommendations adopted by the colloquy, on the basis of a 
transparent and public debate of legislative texts. It also 
urged for the setting up of a multi-party and independent body 
stemming from the executive body which will see to the respect 
of the mutli-party system and the audio-visual media freedom. 
  For the Moroccan human rights organization, `respect of the 
press freedom, the right to information and the entire human 
rights closely depends on the continuous action of journalists, 
an action that is itself linked to the improvement of their work 
and living conditions, the efficiency of the human rights 
movement and the consolidation of the state of law foundations'.

  [Text] The counting of votes in South Africa's [RSA] first 
multiracial elections in the country's history. [as heard] 
Tunisia, being a country committed to the principles of 
democracy and political plurality, which it consolidated in 
practice, has interacted with this event in South Africa. On 
this occasion the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a 
statement, which said that Tunisia today praises the holding of 
the first multiracial elections in South Africa's history ever 
as an important event on the regional and world scales and as a 
victory for freedom and democracy after the policy of apartheid 
had been abolished. 
  Tunisia, which has always supported the process of justice, 
freedom, equality, and peace between South Africa's ethnic 
groups through the persistent support accorded to this process 
by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on all international and 
regional levels, is today greeting and praising all the 
democratic forces in this country and sending expressions of 
esteem to the African National Party's leader, Nelson Mandela, 
and to President Frederik de Klerk for the political wisdom and 
courage they have shown and that allowed the success of the 
democratic process within the framework of South Africa's unity 
and the interests of all Africa's peoples. 
  On this occasion Tunisia congratulates the people of South 
Africa on this historic gain embodied in all its full civil 
rights and wishes the South African people a promising future 
under dignity and consensus after the abolition of all aspects 
of apartheid.

  [Excerpts] The state has an ambitious project in the area 
of telecommunications. The project involves the setting up of 
100 million telephone lines in four years. 
  The Ministry of Communications signed the first deal in this 
context with a German company. Today, the minister of 
communications signed another agreement with the U.S.-Canadian 
Northern Telecom. Details in this report by Imad Koutata: 
  [Koutata] On the basis of this agreement, Tunisia will be 
provided with 360,000 electronic telephone lines that will be 
distributed in many parts of the country. A network of mobile 
telephones, known as JSM, will also be set up. This network 
will include 5,000 lines that will cover the greater Tunis 
province. The network will be a great help to businessmen and 
investors in view of the great incentives and encouragements 
provided for them in the investments code. 
  The agreement also includes a proposal for a partnership 
between Northern Telecom and Tunisia. The partnership will 
concern both industrial and commercial fields. The partnership 
proposal involves the setting up of a center for developing 
programs used in the telecommunications industry, the 
revitalization of the manufacture of subscribers' equipment used 
at telephone exchanges and, finally, the assembly and 
manufacture of telephone exchanges. The agreement opens wide 
prospects for an industrial and commercial partnership between 
the two sides. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Mezri Haddad, researcher in moral and political </F>
philosophy and former editorialist in the Tunisian press: "The 
Election of the King of Tunisia"] 
  [Text] The architect of "change," of the "new era," has 
just been plebiscited by his grateful people, to the ecstatic 
delight of the unanimists, the yes-men, and other sycophants. 
The retiarii and myrmillos of ultrademocratism, who had been 
fighting their own shadows for weeks, have therefore just won a 
"historic victory," as some colleagues in the Tunisian press 
will not fail to boast. These "presidential elections," a 
euphemism to describe the self-confirmation of the existing head 
of state, however farcical they were, are nonetheless full of 
lessons. In the electoral sham of 20 March, he was the only 
candidate to his own succession, because the candidacy of Moncef 
Marzouki, a brave defender of human rights, was received by the 
"pro-Ben Ali" camp if not as a snub, at least as "the 
machinations of an isolated psychopath." This professor of 
medicine is certainly not the only pathological case in this 
country governed by a "philosopher king," because 100 Tunisian 
academics published a communique "supporting Moncef Marzouki's 
right to stand in the presidential election." 
  There is, therefore, no doubt that, in this country, there 
is 
no process of democratization, nor even the slightest intention 
of moving toward a semidemocratic system. Instead, there are 
many signs that Tunisia is sinking further and further into a 
system that gives no place to even the most basic human rights, 
or freedom of thought, or moderated opposition, still less to 
serious elections. A system that relies only on the strength of 
its police--18,000 policemen in 1986, 45,000 today--has a name: 
police state. Gregarious men call it a "happily strong state." 
"Happily" because such a state protects "civilian society" from 
Islamic fundamentalism. Look at what is happening in the 
neighboring country, the regime's feudalists add, as if Algeria 
were in its death throes because of excessive democracy. 
  In reality, many intellectuals already knew that, with or 
without the Islamic fundamentalist specter, Tunisia would 
inexorably move toward a Syrian-style democracy. The second 
regime, born in the confusion of colorful conspiracy and a 
suspect trophy, received as its genetic inheritance the vices 
and responses of the Bourguibian republic, which had been in a 
deep coma since 1980. There was no shortage of signs to 
contemplate while awaiting the face of the new Moloch state: 
seizures of newspapers, relentless repression of political 
oppositionists of all colors, infiltration and neutralization of 
the former powerful trade union federation (the UGTT [General 
Union of Tunisian Workers]), the systematic use of the legal 
apparatus to concoct political trials, the "privatization" of 
opposition parties. 
  But not everything is negative in the nonevent that Tunisia 
has just lived through. Any action or political decision 
contains within it what the sociologists call in their jargon 
aggregation effects (secondary and unexpected effects). In the 
new Tunisian situation, there are two. 
  1. The surprise candidacy of Moncef Marzouki breaks an old 
taboo rooted in Arab and Muslim mentalities, namely that there 
can be no salvation outside the president or petty king you 
have. For years, or even centuries, no Arab head of state has 
been seen to accede to the supreme office by a popular vote. In 
our countries, you do not gain power, you seize it by violence 
or usurp it. Similarly, nobody has ever seen an Arab head of 
state give up power voluntarily. 
  2. A democratic and secular opposition, which had been 
developing for months, has just been born in Tunisia. Men 
disenchanted by their experience hope to change the "change" 
peacefully. They are thus exposing this daunting deception, 
which is keeping the country in hibernation, namely that there 
are only two political protagonists in Tunisia: those who 
aspire to govern in the name of history and those who want to 
govern in the name of an eschatological messianism. Some men, 
and not unimportant ones, think, like Rousseau once did, that 
you can only legitimately govern in the name of the general will.

  [Excerpts] In Tunisia, the International Federation of 
Human Rights has denounced the circumstances in which the two 
trials of Hamma Hammami, leader of the Communist Workers' Party, 
have taken place. [passage omitted] 
  The only nongovernmental organization attending these trials 
was the International Federation of Human Rights. It also 
denounced the difficulties met by Tunisian lawyers in their 
work. Maitre Nathalie Boudjerada spoke to Ghislaine Dupont: 
  [Begin Boudjerada recording] [Tunisian] lawyers are showing 
extraordinary courage. They work in conditions truly alarming 
for their profession. All those taking part in political trials 
no longer have their passports. All have their telephone 
bugged. All are followed. On the eve of an important political 
trial, they are summoned to meet the minister of the interior or 
the minister of justice. Their cars and fax machines are 
stolen. Their working conditions as lawyers are really [word 
indistinct] and this is why I would like to praise their courage 
and dignity. It is really good to see that colleagues who are 
among the last remaining people to speak up under these regimes 
are continuing to plead, continuing to travel across Tunisia to 
assist defendants. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Sikandar Bakht: "Kashmir, Human Right, and </F>
America"] 
  [Text] All the announcements made by the government about 
the improving situation in Kashmir and the reduction in 
terrorist activities are wrong. The situation in the valley is 
still bad, and this fire has spread to the Jammu area also. 
Bombs are being blasted in Doda, Udhampur, Kishtwar, and Jammu 
city itself, and the sphere of terrorist activities is 
increasing. 
  Bomb blasts, loss of innocent lives, and looting and burning 
are very common now. It seems that the government is sleeping. 
Such incidents have been happening in Jammu region for the last 
four years. Our government refuses to wake up. We are not 
talking about limited activities, but of total inactivity! How 
can there be any good administration possible when the 
responsibility for administration has been given to criminals 
who have served jail terms, are untrustworthy, have bad records, 
and have been expelled from their positions for some crime or 
other. Such people have been appointed to important positions. 
These include persons who had opposed India at the United 
Nations level. How can we expect the situation to improve with 
such appointments? The situation in the home ministry is such 
that one minister says one thing and the other something else. 
  Both ministers in the home ministry have adopted different 
attitudes about Jammu-Kashmir, and the attitude of the 
Jammu-Kashmir government is yet another factor. Let us take the 
Hazratbal affair. It is hard to understand why the government 
wants to provide itself such an elaborate proof. The opinion of 
the security forces about it is very different. 
  How many murders have been committed in Doda and Kishtwar? 
How many bombs went off? What kind of situation exists in Jammu? 
The situation of the Jammu population is very different from 
that of the valley population. If the situation continues to 
worsen here, it could get a lot more dangerous than in the 
valley. I just do not understand some of the developments. My 
simple and straight question is: How long will we play with 
words? We want to continue our talks with Pakistan. We have also 
have presented six points on which the talks would be based. 
Pakistan has taken the position that it wants to talk to us on 
its own terms. I wish that the Parliament first explained to the 
people of our country what right Pakistan has to interfere in a 
situation that is between us and our people? Whatever is 
happening between us and our own people is our own affair and I 
just do not understand the reason for holding mutual talks [with 
Pakistan] over it. 
  Pakistan's position in Kashmir is only that of an aggressor. 
The only question we can discuss with Pakistan is: When will it 
withdraw from the area it has taken over as an invader? I fail 
to understand why we repeatedly use words which leave out many 
facts. Why have we accepted Pakistan according to its own 
perspective instead of from our own perception? Whenever we talk 
with Pakistan at the international level, we talk under the 
conditions set by Pakistan, for example, violation of human 
rights. 
  Why do not we tell Pakistan that it has no right to 
interfere 
in our affairs? We have failed to present our case to the world 
that the talks that are being held with Pakistan are over the 
part of Kashmir that is occupied by Pakistan. In fact, the talks 
should be held to discuss the region that Pakistan is occupying 
illegally. We have not been able to explain at the international 
forum that we can hold talks with Pakistan only based on the 
removal of the Pakistani government's and the Pakistani army's 
occupation of Kashmir. We have not been able to present this 
case strongly to this date. 
  Pakistan has talked a lot about self-determination, however, 
it does not understand what this term means. If we talk about 
self-determination within the framework of all countries in the 
world, every country has the danger of breaking up. 
Self-determination can lead only to breaking up a country. 
  Just like any other country, India also has its own borders. 
Is it possible that people from any part of India should ask for 
separating from India based on their self-determination right? 
Obviously, we cannot endanger any nation's unity this way. No 
part of India can be separated from it, and we must explain this 
very clearly to the international community. The fact is that 
the international community does not have the right to interfere 
in any country's internal affair. Jammu-Kashmir's merger into 
India is both legal and final. This has been fully supported in 
the United Nations also. The United Nations also has recognized 
that Pakistan is illegally occupying a part of Indian territory. 
However, we have fully failed in raising these basic issues. We 
must explain to the international community that if any Indian 
state is toyed with under Pakistan's pressure, the scary 
catastrophe of the 1947 partition would be reenacted. 
Unfortunately, the shadows of the 1947 partition are still 
chasing us. Pakistan by interfering in the Kashmir issue, 
various parties that are active in Kashmir, and the people who 
are trying to give a religious color to this affair, have all 
forgotten that India's Muslims do not live only in Kashmir. 120 
million Muslims are spread all over India. 
  As for the human rights issue, the statements issued by 
Robin 
Raphel and Clinton are very disappointing. Robin Raphel has put 
a question mark on Kashmir's merger into India. By saying this, 
she has implied what the United Nations has said is also wrong. 
President Clinton and Robin Raphel forgot that the human rights 
in Kashmir are being violated by the terrorists who are trained 
in Pakistan and sent to our country for carrying on murder and 
carnage in our country. I would like to ask a basic question of 
the Americans. Have they read the history of India? Do they know 
that the thousands of years old Indian culture is based on human 
rights? The foundation of our thousands of years old 
civilization and culture is human rights. Our nation's 
civilization never practiced piracy. Our nation has never 
colonized another country. We never even thought about 
colonizing. Our nation gave birth to Mahatma Buddha, Bhagwan 
Mahavir, and Mahatma Gandhi. These are the people who are known 
as ambassadors of peace and non-violence in the whole world. The 
United States itself fought a bloody battle to keep its unity. 
What lesson can it give us about human rights today? Other 
civilizations in the world have taken lessons from us in this 
subject. 
  It is surprising that whoever talks about human rights in 
Kashmir only sees the security forces. They never mention human 
rights violations committed by the terrorists who are playing 
with the lives of innocent citizens day and night. They do not 
mention that their extreme actions and atrocities have forced 
hundreds and thousands of Kashmiris to flee their homes and live 
in camps outside Delhi. Our government has failed to shed light 
on this aspect of terrorism in Kashmir. We can easily find an 
answer to this question if we recognize whether the terrorists 
or the security forces came to Kashmir first. It is clear that 
the terrorists came there and spread terrorism and tried to 
break up our country. That is when the need to send the security 
forces there was felt. The security forces are protecting lives 
and property of the citizens in Kashmir. 
  I want to tell the U.S. administration that the UN 
resolutions about holding a plebiscite that Pakistan talks about 
day and night also call for Pakistan to vacate the part of 
Kashmir it is occupying. We have failed to communicate this fact 
also. Is it not surprising that they are talking about holding a 
plebiscite by separating it from the whole resolution! 
  We are being very careful. I know the problems the 
government 
is facing. It has to go to the World Bank, and borrow money from 
the IMF. The situation is such that India cannot function 
without borrowing money, everything will close. We cannot borrow 
money from these international organizations until the United 
States supports our request. However, when India's dignity is 
challenged, when India's self-respect is challenged, then, in my 
opinion, we should remain hungry and not give the United States 
the right to trifle with our national pride. 
  The situation is very painful when we give our statements 
with such hesitancy, fearing that we do not get out of the 
diplomatic language. We are not willing to pawn our national 
pride and dignity to even the most powerful nation in the 
world--the United States or any other nation-- when it comes to 
Kashmir and India's unity. The Indian people are willing to 
remain hungry, but are not willing to compromise their 
self-respect. We have to understand this perfectly. 
  I am now hearing some talk in my own country about starting 
a 
political process in Kashmir. I also support the political 
process. However, I have some questions before we do that. My 
first point is that political process has been tried in Kashmir 
for a long time. We had a government elected by democratic 
process functioning there. This political process has been 
working for several decades. The governments elected by the 
people ran the business in Kashmir. How did terrorism arise 
while these governments were there? Now, if we think that a 
political process is necessary to end terrorism, I do not want 
to muddle up this issue by saying that the present situation in 
Kashmir has resulted mostly from the lack of strong leadership 
there. The political process could not create a strong and 
responsible leadership. I wonder if the reason for starting a 
political process is to make the United States 
happy?

<F P=106> [Article by Manmohan Sharma: "Sangh Family Preparing for </F>
Movements at Krishna's Birthplace and Vishwanath Temple"] 
  [Text] After Professor Rajendar Singh, popularly known as 
Rajju Bhaiya, was named the fourth director of the RSS 
[Rashtriya Swyamsevak Sangh], the possibilities of the RSS 
family forming an aggressive attitude have increased. Rajju 
Bhaiya is a politician and his appointment will definitely 
influence national politics. In addition to making plans to 
build Rama's temple in Ayodhya, the Sangh family is rigorously 
preparing for obtaining Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi and 
Krishna's birthplace in Mathura. There will be vidhan sabha 
elections in 10 states next year. Rajju Bhaiya will have to plan 
a strategy in order to improve BJP's [Bharatiya Janata Party] 
situation during these elections. It was decided in the BJP's 
national working committee meeting held recently in Hyderabad to 
emphasize the issue of Hindutva. 
  Seeing the present situation of various Sangh family 
organizations, accepting the position of the RSS director is 
analogous to wearing a crown made of thorns. Rajju Bhaiya will 
have to take strong action to stop the waywardness which is 
increasing in the once-disciplined Sangh family. It is said that 
Rajju Bhaiya is very upset at the increasing undiscipline in the 
BJP. It was also learned that he had directed BJP leaders to 
give up their royal living style and lead simpler lives. 
  There are also talks about the RSS attitude becoming very 
severe towards the present central government. Only a few people 
know the fact that former Sangh President M.D. Deoras and Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao were classmates in Nagpur a long time ago 
and both talked to each other directly. Perhaps that is why the 
BJP had helped Mr. Rao many times when Mr. Rao was in trouble. 
Recently, there was a similar occurrence. The government was 
having problems in getting the bill asking for the privatization 
of banks, insurance companies, and airlines passed. Raja 
Maheshwar Singh, a BJP member, had the plan to disobey the 
president's directive. However, he did not push it. The BJP 
member abstained when the vote was taken. Similarly, the BJP 
helped the government in getting a bill passed in the Lok Sabha. 
Rajju Bhaiya admitted that Atal Behari Bajpayee had accepted the 
leadership of the Indian delegation to Geneva with his 
permission. Now the attitude of the Sangh family definitely will 
change towards the Rao government. The RSS wants to get other 
parties' support against the Dunkel proposals. It is said that 
RSS had assured George Fernandes of its cooperation in opposing 
the Dunkel proposals, however, Fernandes did not accept the 
offer. It was also learned that Rajju Bhaiya met Chandra Shekhar 
recently and offered to start a campaign against the Dunkel 
proposals, however, Chandra Shekhar suggested that it would be 
better for the two parties to run their campaigns separately. 
The word is that Rajju Bhaiya had formed this strategy to 
separate left-wing parties from other parties. It also appears 
that Rajju Bhaiya is very eager to establish contacts with 
Janata Dal's V.P. Singh. He was V.P. Singh's professor at 
Allahabad University. It is also being said that Rajju Bhaiya 
supports the idea of establishing coalitions with the 
non-Congress parties in the states where the BJP is weak, 
however, the BJP high command does not support this idea. It 
wants the BJP to win the next election on its own strength as 
forming coalitions with other parties will only hurt the BJP. 
Therefore, the possibility of the BJP forming a coalition with a 
non-Congress front is very small. 
  Rajju Bhaiya has announced that the claim on the Gyanvapi 
mosque in Varanasi and on the Idgah building in Krishna's 
birthplace in Mathura will not be relinquished. The Vishwa Hindu 
Parishad (VHP) has selected these three [including Ayodhya] 
places from among more than 3,000 sites for return to their 
original use. These sites are extremely holy for the Hindus and 
are of no importance to the Muslims. Therefore, the Muslims 
should hand these over to the Hindus to win their goodwill. This 
will help foster friendship between the two groups. He said that 
this is the goal, however, the VHP has to decide how it achieves 
this goal. The Sangh family will cooperate with the VHP in this 
effort. 
  The VHP has been claiming for the last several years that 
other religious groups have taken over 3,000 to 5,000 Hindu 
worship places and have changed the structures totally. The 
victors had done this to crush the self-respect of the 
vanquished community and to destroy the Hindu culture. It is 
said that Mogul emperor Aurangzeb had destroyed the Vishwanath 
temple in Varanasi and built a mosque on that site. This is 
known as Gyanvapi mosque now. Similarly, the temple in Mathura 
at Krishna's bithplace was destroyed by Aurangzeb, Mehmood 
Gaznavi, and others several times. At present, the Idgah that 
Aurangzeb built at Krishna's bithplace stands there. 
  After destruction of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, security 
arrangements around these places in Varanasi and Mathura have 
been strengthened. Steel fencing costing over 250 million rupees 
has been built around these places, and para-military forces are 
protecting them round the clock. 
  It is important to mention here that the present Vishwanath 
temple was built by Indore's queen Ahilya Bai and Sher-i Punjab 
Ranjit Singh had mounted about five mounds [about 200 kilograms] 
of gold on its roof. At present, this temple is under government 
control. Similarly, Varanasi's king Patni Mal had bought 
Mathura's site for 5,000 rupees in an auction from the East 
India Company. In 1935, Pandit Madan Mohan Maulviya decided to 
rebuild it and contacted Seth Ghanshyam Das Birla. Rai Krishna 
Das was Raja Patni's successor and did not want to sell this 
historical place and Birla did not want to accept it for free. 
It was decided in the end to pay 5,000 rupees to Ram Krishna Das 
as fee for this land, which he would later donate to the temple 
foundation. When the temple foundation dug the land for lying 
the foundation, they found many ancient artifacts there. These 
prove that Krishna was born at that site. Mr. Maulviya did start 
the work of building this temple, however, he could not finish 
it. He died during that time. The temple was finished due to the 
efforts of the Birla brothers and the editor of KALYAN, Jay 
Dayal Goenka, however, the Idgah building still stands on the 
original bithplace. The Hindus are not allowed to enter the 
Idgah. the same is true about the Gyanvapi masque. 
  The RSS was founded by a Congress Party member, Dr. Keshav 
Baliram Hedgewar in 1925 in Nagpur. The goal was to unite the 
Hindus and protect their religion and culture. The RSS slowly 
spread in various parts of the country. After Dr. Hedgewar's 
demise in 1940, the working committee opened a sealed envelope 
left by him and learned that he had appointed M.S. Golwalkar as 
his successor. Before working for the RSS, Golwalkar was a 
mathematics professor at Benares Hindu University. At the time 
he was appointed to the executive director's position, he was 
working as its secretary. He was only 34 years old at that time. 
  The government banned the RSS for four years when Mr. Gandhi 
was assassinated. Over 200,000 volunteers took part in a 
satyagraha [peaceful demonstration] to help remove this ban. 
Guru Golwalkar established several front organizations in order 
to expand RSS activities. Golowalkar just before his death in 
1973 appointed then general secretary Balasaheb Deoras as his 
successor by leaving his name in a sealed envelope. 
  Three months ago, I informed the nation before anyone else 
that Balasaheb Deoras was ready to retire and appoint a capable 
person as his successor. Professor Rajendar Singh was one of the 
possible successors. When this news was published in the PUNJAB 
KESARI many people refused to believe it. Some people were very 
critical of it, however, now it has been proven that my 
information published in The PUNJAB KESARI was correct. It is 
true that Balasaheb Deoras' health was not good for the last two 
years. He had a stroke and his body was paralyzed, however, this 
news was kept secret from the members. Last year, when his 
younger brother, Bhaurao Deoras, died in Delhi, some of the 
members saw his serious condition at the Nigambodh cremation 
place. At that time, he had expressed his desire to one of his 
senior associates that he wanted to appoint an able successor 
since he could not do his job because of his illness. 
  As for Professor Rajendar Singh also known as Rajju Bhaiya, 
he is 72 years old. He was born in Bulandshaher in Uttar 
Pradesh. His father, Thakur Balbir Singh, was the first Indian 
chief engineer of Uttar Pradesh. He was educated at the Modern 
School in Delhi and a very good public [private] school in 
Nainital. He scored highest points in the high school 
examination in the whole nation. He earned M.S.C. in physical 
sciences from Allahabad University. Until 1942, he was a 
card-carrying Congress Party member. At that time, he met 
Bhaurao Deoras, who brought him into the RSS. Between 1952 and 
1966, he worked as a professor and also worked for the RSS to 
expand its program. He resigned from the university in 1967 and 
was appointed the administrator for the northeastern region. He 
was also administrator for Uttar Pradesh. In troubled times, he 
took responsibility for administration. He was appointed 
associate director of the RSS. 
  He was appointed executive secretary in 1978. The high 
command removed him from this position in 1987. At that time, it 
was claimed that he had resigned from the position because of 
his poor health. His successor was H.V. Sheshadri who was also 
the chairman of Dr. Hedgewar's birth centennial celebration. 
  The first three executive directors of the RSS were 
Maharashtrian Brahmans while Rajju Bhaiya is a Rajput from Uttar 
Pradesh. Fot the first time in the history of RSS, the executive 
director has appointed his successor while he was still alive. 
The first three executive directors of the RSS were bachelors 
while Rajju Bhaiya is married and has a family. 
  There are several administrators in the RSS high command who 
are senior to Rajju Bhaiya. These include Dattopant Thengari, 
the founder of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh [BMS] (Indian Labour 
Union), who is considered the greatest thinker in the RSS 
family. He also founded another associate organization, the 
Bharatiya Kisan Sangh [BKS] (Indian Farmers Union). He is a 
Maharasthrian Brahman and has been a Rajya Sabha member for 12 
years. In addition to him, Mr. H. V. Sheshadri, the present 
executive secretary of the RSS, is the most powerful person in 
the RSS. He is from Karnataka and a writer by profession. He has 
written dozens of books. Moropant Pingle is also a senior 
administrator and has been executive secretary once. He is the 
head of the VHP now. He is a skilled organizer and a 
Maharashtrian Chitpawan Brahman. Why did Balasaheb Deoras ignore 
these senior officials and appoint Prof. Rajender Singh his 
successor? There are various conjectures about it. It is not 
possible to say anything definite about any of these people. 
  The new executive director has appointed Mr. Sheshadri the 
secretary general. It was the first time in the RSS history that 
three joint secretaries were appointed. These include C.K. 
Sudarshan who was still in this position when Suresh Katekar was 
appointed joint secretary. The third joint secretary is Madan 
Das who was the president of the All India Students Federation 
until recently. He was appointed secretary general of the 
anti-Dunkel awareness campaign. 
  He has appointed Abha Thite, Guru Golwalkar's personal 
secretary, administrator of eastern region, Jitendra Vir as 
northern region's administrator, and Subraynam Swami as southern 
region's administrator. He also appointed B. Hari central 
administrator for India, Bal Apte as head of the All India 
Students Federation, and Ashok Singhal as the head of the VHP 
[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]. His team is relatively young and most 
of them are about 50 years old. 
  It is important to mention here that the executive 
administrators of the RSS are also responsible for taking care 
of the other organizations within the Sangh family. 
  There are about 7,000 administrators. They are not allowed 
to 
marry. The Sangh has about 35,000 branches and has a membership 
between 7 and 9 million. There are 47 organizations in the Sangh 
family. The major organizations among these are the BJP, VHP, 
Indian Labour Union, Sanskar Bharati, Vidya Bharati, and the 
BKS.

<F P=106> [All names as published] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, March 11. In an historic verdict, the 
supreme court today unanimously upheld the dismissal of the 
erstwhile BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] governments in M.P. 
[Madhya Pradesh], Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh in the wake of 
the demolition of the Babri masjid at Ayodhya on December 6, 
1992, and at the same time struck down as unconstitutional the 
sacking of the three other ministries, including that of the 
S.R. Bommai (Janata Dal) in Karnataka, reports PTI [Press Trust 
of India]. 
  It is for the first time the dismissal of state governments 
and imposition of President's rule has been held as 
unconstitutional. 
  Delivering judgment on petitions challenging the validity of 
Article 356 of the constitution under which these governments 
were dismissed and President's rule imposed, the nine-judge 
bench, headed by Mr. Justice S.R. Pandian, declared in 
unequivocal terms that secularism being the bedrock of the 
constitution, any act of a state to subvert this could "lawfully 
be deemed to give rise to a situation where the government 
cannot be carried on in accordance with law". 
  The judges on the bench comprised Mr. Justice A.M. Ahmedi, 
Mr. Justice Kuldip Singh, Mr. Justice J.S. Verma, Mr. Justice 
P.B. Sawant, Mr. Justice K. Ramaswamy, Mr. Justice S.C. 
Aggarwal, Mr. Justice Yogeshwar Dayal and Mr. Justice B.P. 
Jeevan Reddy. 
  The bench, however, held as unconstitutional the 1989 
dismissal of the Janata Dal government headed by Mr. S.R. Bommai 
in Karnataka and the Meghalaya and Nagaland governments in 
January 1991 and August 1988 respectively. 
  The judges made it clear that they could, however, not 
direct 
the revival of these governments as fresh elections held during 
the intervening periods had led to the installation of new 
ministries. 
  The sharpest indictment of the policies and programmes of 
the 
Bharatiya Janata Party came from Mr. Justice K. Ramaswamy who 
dwelt at length in separate but concurring judgment on the 
party's efforts to use religion in politics which was expressly 
prohibited by the constitution. 
  "Any act by a political party or government of a state in 
furtherance of its policies and programmes to mix religion with 
politics is violative of not only the law but the constitution," 
Mr. Justice Ramaswamy declared. 
  The judge observed that if religion was overplayed by 
political parties it was bound to result in eruption of social 
tensions. Religion he said cannot be mixed with politics. 
  Justifying the imposition of President's rule and the 
dissolution of the assemblies of the three states, Mr. Justice 
Ramaswamy said when the President feels that religion had been 
mixed with politics by the party in power he was free to reach a 
satisfaction under Article 356 in accordance with law. 
  Earlier, Mr. Justice Pandian in his judgment said he was 
however, of the firm opinion that the power of the President to 
impose President's rule and dissolve assemblies, should be used 
sparingly only when he was fully satisfied as to the situation. 
The party in power at the Centre should not be allowed to use 
the provision to disrupt constitutional balance by frequent 
exercise of the power through the President who acts on the 
advice of the Centre. 
  Mr. Justice Pandian pointed out that as per official 
records, 
in the last 41 years Article 356 had been invoked by various 
ruling parties in power at the Centre 95 times. On 23 occasions 
assemblies were dissolved and in 18 cases the assemblies kept in 
suspended animation had been revived. 
  "Pathetically, the provisions had been used frequently to 
disrupt constitutional balance and as a result the chief 
ministers of the states were held in perpetual fear of the act 
of Presidential proclamation. The chief ministers were in many 
cases not sure that they would remain in power and stand up in 
their seats to fulfil constitutional obligations," Mr. Justice 
Pandian said. 
  In his judgment, Mr. Justice Ahmedi said article 74(2) under 
which the Prime Minister and his council of ministers advice the 
President in the exercise of his power to impose President's 
rule was not a bar for judicial review of the decision. 
  Merely because a political party had come to power at the 
Centre with a majority was not sufficient reason for imposition 
of President's rule to dislodge state governments led by other 
political parties. 
  In his concurring judgment, Mr. Justice J.S. Verma said only 
objective factors like subversion of the principles of 
secularism and failure of constitutional machinery of the state 
could be used to invoke Article 356. 
  The judge said imponderable materials which do not strictly 
constitute legal evidence and thus are incapable of being tested 
in a court of law, cannot be judicially reviewable. 
  Mr. Justice P.B. Sawant in his judgment ruled that the 
validity of the proclamation under Article 356 was judicially 
reviewable to the extent that the materials relied on by the 
President were not relevant or extraneous and the exercise of 
power was malafide. 
  In such a case if the concerned state government effected by 
the decision could make out a prima facie case then it would be 
the burden of the Central government to prove that the materials 
did in fact exist. 
  Mr. Justice Sawant was also of the view that article 74(2) 
was not a bar against scrutiny of the material on which the 
President had based his satisfaction. 
  The judge made it clear that since Article 356 was also 
intended to check the power of the President in imposing 
Presidents rule, it was not permissible for the President to 
take irreversible action of dissolving the state assembly till 
Parliament approved his action in imposing President's rule. 
  Mr. Justice Sawant said if the presidential proclamation was 
held invalid notwithstanding Parliament's approval the court had 
the power to restore status quo ante of the legislative assembly.

<F P=106> [Article by Hemant Sharma: "Kanshi Ram Is Extending His </F>
Influence Amongst Backwards and Muslims"; all quotations marks 
as published] 
  [Text] Kanpur, 6 April. After having the Dalits on his 
side, Kanshi Ram is trying to expand his base among other 
backward castes and the Muslims. The Kushwaha and Muslim 
conference on Tuesday in Kanpur was part of this effort. Kanshi 
Ram's cunning strategy is to steal away Mulayam Singh's support 
base. However, Kanshi Ram has taken this initiative in order to 
be able to form a government in U.P. [Uttar Pradesh] on his own. 
Kanshi Ram argues that the Dalits, backwards, and Muslims make 
up 90 percent of the country's total population. If they united, 
then the 10 percent high caste people would not have any clout. 
  Kanshi Ram is playing his "backward" card to attract the 
other backward castes. He made this an issue in yesterday's 
meeting. Kanshi Ram said that the backwards make up 52 percent 
of the population, however, their share in the nation's 
government and administration is only three percent. Every 
leader who had played the backward politics, has deceived them. 
  Kanshi Ram sang this same song until late that night in the 
Chaman Ganj area. In this meeting, organized by the Indian 
Islamic Organization, Kanshi Ram said, "The Brahman group is 
responsible for the injustice against the Muslims. If you join 
the Dalits, no power can rule you." Kanshi Ram said that the 
lower castes and Muslims have united in Kanpur for elections. 
Until now, the Brahman forces have been using them [Dalits] for 
causing riots so that some of them die and the Brahmans could 
benefit. 
  Not many Muslims came to hear Kanshi Ram in this 
Muslim-majority area. The speeches were very hot, excited, and 
dramatic in this meeting attended by about 2,000-2,500 people. 
Amidst the "Allah-ho Akbar" slogans, it was said, "Neither a 
court nor a government can make decisions on the Babri Masjid. 
We are strong. If we have the authority, we will build the 
mosque there." Maulana Habib-ul Rehman Ludhianvi said in Kanshi 
Ram's presence, "The friendship between the Dalits and the 
Muslims is very old." Later, Maulana also advised Kanshi Ram to 
convert to Islam. 
  Calling Kanshi Ram the greatest supporter of the Muslims, 
Kanpur's leading Muslim Maulana Abdul Baqi appealed to the 
Muslims to follow Kanshi Ram. This meeting was held through the 
efforts of Masaud Ahmed, the state minister for education. In 
order to make sure that only the BSP [Bahujan Samaj Party] 
benefits from this meeting, Mulayam Singh was not invited 
despite great efforts by the SP [Samajwadi Party] people. Even 
Mulayam Singh's name was not mentioned in this meeting. Kanshi 
Ram and the BSP were called the real saviors of the Muslims in 
this meeting. It was said that Kanshi Ram provided 96 vidhan 
sabha and 21 Lok Sabha seats to the Muslims in the 1989 
election. The numbers for the 1991 election were 105 and 22 
respectively. No other party has ever given so many tickets to 
the Muslims. In the 1993 vidhan sabha elections, the Congress 
gave Muslims 26 out of 425 tickets, the Janata Dal 29 out of 
375, and the Samajwadi Party gave 36 out of 265 tickets to the 
Muslims. However, Kanshi Ram gave 49 out of 167 tickets to the 
Muslims. Therefore, only Kanshi Ram can be the answer to the 
problems of Muslims. 
  Kanshi Ram said that the Muslims were in a dilemma during 
the 
recent election. They were not with Mulayam Singh, however. They 
were joining him [Kanshi Ram] now because he had called more 
than 40 meetings "to encourage brotherhood." The BSP people have 
travelled on bicycles to improve relations. That is why the 
Muslims are not taking part in riots happening in the western 
and northern parts of the state. The government has abused the 
Muslims. Mansoor Khan, the state's education minister, appealed 
to the Muslims, "You have seen them all. Now give two months to 
Kanshi Ram. All your problems will be resolved." 
  In the Kushwaha Mahasabha meeting, Kanshi Ram told the same 
things to other backward groups. He said, "This is your 
condition today. You are the majority among the backward castes, 
but you have no part in administration or the government. You 
are misled during the elections. You support the Janata Dal, the 
Congress Party, and the BJP one after another. The partnership 
of the backward castes in Uttar Pradesh government is less than 
that even of the Dalits. It has been 64 years since the Round 
Table conference was held, and 45 years since we got 
independence. However, the backward castes have not received 
their share yet." 
  Kanshi Ram refered to the IAS [Indian Administrative 
Service] 
to impress this fact on the backwards saying, "There are 550 IAS 
officers in U.P. and only seven of them are from backward 
classes. The Dalits trusted Dr. Ambedekar and listened to him. 
That is why there are 112 officers from the Dalit group. The 
backward castes are 50 years behind the Dalits now. They must 
think now and the whole Bahujan Samaj will have to fight as a 
group." 
  Kanshi Ram refuses to admit that he is trying to cut his 
associate Mulayam Singh's support base. He said, "I am just 
uniting the BSP." However, many SP leaders did join the BSP in 
the Kushwaha conference. High state officials along with several 
hundred cars with blue and red lights were there to protect 
Kanshi Ram.

<F P=106> [Article by Prabhash Joshi: "Who is Afraid of Kanshi Ram?"] </F>
  [Text] The muck that Mayavati slung around did not stick 
despite the Holi festival. There just was no question of its 
sticking on Gandhi. However, even Kanshi Ram could not 
understand what happened to this muck that was flung around 
after a lot of planning. Now he is going around telling people 
that if the BSP government is formed, he will remove the 
Rashtrapita [Father of the Nation] title used for Gandhi. If 
Kanshi Ram does not know, we must tell him, that calling Gandhi 
Rashtrapita has nothing to do with any government. No Congress 
government has given this title to Gandhi. There is no law which 
says that Gandhi should be known as the Rashtrapita. In the 
constitution written by Baba Saheb Ambedkar, there is no article 
about "Rashtrapita." 
  There is a position of president in the Constitution. The 
Sangh family people who consider it inappropriate to call Gandhi 
the Rashtrapita should ask themselves why should the nation 
called India have a "pati" [husband] when it does not have a 
"pita" [father]? Similarly, is the army a woman that it should 
have a pati? I know that "pati" in "senapati"[military 
commander] does not mean husband. However, the "pita" in 
rashtrapita does not imply a father, either. Neither the Sangh 
family nor Kanshi Ram is doing any favor to poor Bapu [father] 
Gandhi. Neither the Congress Party nor the Congress government 
made him the father of the nation. It was Subhash Chandra Bose 
who first called him the father of the nation, and just like 
Ambedekar, he disagreed with Mr. Gandhi on several issues. Many 
people admit that Bose was not treated fairly similar to the 
treatment of Ambedekar. 
  It is popular practice to call Gandhi the father of the 
nation and this appellation materialized during our independence 
struggle. As long as the people respect him, it does not matter 
whether there is a BSP government or a BJP [government]. They 
may have a huge majority in the Parliament but this image just 
cannot be removed from people's minds. No government can remove 
popular beliefs by issuing edicts. Even dictators like Hitler 
and Mussolini could not change the people. Autocratic communist 
governments could not make such changes. The power of the 
government is limited when dealing with the populace. 
  If Kanshi Ram cannot understand this truth about human 
society, it is not just because like Mayavati, he is a political 
illiterate (as Chandra Shekhar put it). Kanshi Ram and Mayavati 
both consider themselves representatives of the lower castes. 
They distort history while speaking the language and cliches of 
the people around them. That is why the talks of Manyavar 
[respected one] (as Mayavati calls him) are saidto be some kind 
of epigram language in the Hindi-speaking areas. One epigram 
popular around here is, "The new mullah [Muslim priest] chants 
Allah-Allah all the time." We do not have to explain it since no 
one can understand it. The 'Respected One', Kanshi Ram, is the 
newest mullah in the government. He is a junior partner in 
Mulayam Singh's minority government in Uttar Pradesh. However, 
he is crying "power" as if he is a political Allah. 
  However, this is not the only proverb that fits him. There 
is 
another axiom that the Hindi region has for people like him. I 
know that people will say that I am using this proverb because 
of my Brahmanic arrogant mentality. Let them say that. However, 
just like there is no proof that the word 'Harijan' was coined 
by Mahatma Gandhi, there is no proof that this proverb was 
originated by a Brahman or the Brahman caste. You all know this 
proverb and it is popular in different regions in different 
formats: If a mouse finds a rag, it considers itself a cloth 
merchant. In some places, they say: If a mouse finds a rag, it 
considers itself a king. 
  Now, there are at least 25 states in India that is Bharat. 
Uttar Pradesh is one of these states. It is the largest state if 
you consider population, however, it is still only one of 25 
states. Its vidhan sabha has 421 seats and there were elections 
for these 421 seats last November. The Bahujan Samaj Party which 
supposedly represents bahujans (the masses) won only 68 seats 
out of the total of 421 seats. It had this success only because 
it ran for elections in cooperation with Mulayam Singh Yadav's 
Samajwadi Party. Manyavar Kanshi Ram's BSP could not even win 
one-sixth of the total U.P. Vidhan Sabha seats. If we count all 
the seats in state vidhan sabhas in the nation, these 68 seats 
looklike a small rag cut out of the huge bolt of cloth. However, 
Kanshi Ram is using these seats to announce that his party will 
form governments in several states during the next two years, 
and the BSP will form the government at the Center [national 
government] after the '96 election. 
  We do not have to go very far [for proof]. BJP [Bharatiya 
Janata Party] claimed that a larger number of people 
participated in the Rama temple campaign than in the 
independence struggle and considered itself to be the only 
representative of Hindus who constitute 82 percent of the 
nation. BJP had established its governments in four 
states--Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and 
Himachal--in December 1992. It also had 119 seats in the 
Parliament. Its Rama disciples did not care for anyone else and 
destroyed the Babri Masjid while celebrating a "Hindu victory 
day." The BJP was fully confident that the injustice done to the 
one of the holiest Hindu shrine was vindicated, therefore, the 
whole Hindu world would be ecstatic and the BJP would win any 
election from there on. Its slogan during the election held a 
year later was, "Now five states, tomorrow the whole nation." 
What did the Hindus of these five states do to the BJP? We do 
not need to tell you that. 
  Compared to Manyavar Kanshi Ram's BSP getting 68 seats, 
right 
here in Uttar Pradesh the BJP won 2.75 times more seats during 
this very election! If we look at the percentage of votes, the 
BJP received six times more votes than did the BSP. Kanshi Ram 
calls his BSP the party of the masses because if the scheduled 
castes and tribes, backward castes, and Dalits are combined, his 
party would have the majority of people in this country behind 
it. The BJP arithmetic was much simpler that this. It did not 
have to combine several castes. More than 82 percent people in 
this country are Hindus. There is only one party of the 
Hindus--BJP. Hindutva [Hinduness] is its only philosophy. Kanshi 
Ram considers the higher castes separate from himself while the 
BJP considers all Hindus to be one. If we use Kanshi Ram's 
reasoning, the BJP should have the right to form the government 
all over India permanently since the Hindus have the majority 
vote in India. 
  That fact that the Hindus in the nation are not with the BJP 
was proved not only during the November elections but during all 
the elections that were held in the past. How can we accept 
Kanshi Ram's claim that the Dalits, semi-Dalits, and all 
backward castes are with him? In any society, the majority never 
works together, however, the minorities have the tendency to 
unite in every part of the world. Jinnah had claimed that the 
Muslims in the whole country were with him and his Muslim League 
was the only party representing the Muslims. Only the English 
who wanted to divided India into several countries endorsed 
Jinnah's claim. The minority Muslims in India did not accept 
that. When Pakistan was established, and even now, there were 
and are more Muslims in India than in Pakistan. No one has 
forced them to live in India. Most of the Muslims in undivided 
India preferred to stay in secular India rather that going to 
Islamic Pakistan. What better example can there be to show the 
hollowness of the claims made by the sole representatives of a 
caste or religious group? 
  Kanshi Ram, who has the rag of 68 seats and is in the 
government for a short time, is challenging everyone in the 
nation on behalf of the BSP. If he does not understand the 
reality of BJP, we will present him with the example of Devi 
Lal. Devi Lal had won 86 of the 90 seats in the Haryana vidhan 
sabha. At that time, he was considered the most powerful leader 
using caste as an issue. He not only considered himself the 
leader of the Jats in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and 
Rajasthan, but also wanted to become the leader of farmers all 
over the country. The BJP was confident that all Hindus were 
with it. If they were not, they were going to be. Kanshi Ram 
believes that all Dalits and semi-Dalits are with him. Since the 
Hindus and the Dalits and semi-Dalits are the majority, both the 
BJP and the BSP claim that they can form a government over the 
whole nation. 
  Devi Lal also had the same confidence in the majority. He 
knew, and said openly, that there are no Jats [farming caste] 
south of the Vindhya mountains. Therefore, he considered himself 
the leader of the majority because he was a farmer and not 
because of the power he got as leader of the Jats. He said that 
farmers were all over the country and, therefore, farmers were 
the majority in an agricultural nation. If all farmers united, 
he would be ruling the whole country. Devi Lal wanted to rule 
the nation as the leader of the farmers. He used to openly 
ridicule the Indian Farmers Union. His simple argument was that 
a union is formed by a weak and minority group to fight against 
the powerful majority. What need did the farmers have to form a 
union? They have the majority in the nation, and votes. 
  Devi Lal wanted to form the government of farmers just like 
Kanshi Ram wants the government of Dalits. Devi Lal ridiculed 
the farmers union because he believed that the farmers made up 
the majority in the nation, and they should form the government. 
The rest of the people should be at their mercy. Similarly, 
Kanshi Ram ridicules reservation quotas. The majority in the 
nation are the Dalits and they should have the government. When 
they form the government, the minority Brahmans, Kshatariyas, 
and other castes will have reserved quotas. Devi Lal believed 
that all the problems the farmers have will be resolved once 
they have their own government. Therefore, he asked the farmers 
to unite and help him form the government with their votes. 
Kanshi Ram also says that if the Dalits win the government, all 
their problems will be resolved. Thus, he is going around 
telling the Dalits that he will help them form their own 
government. Just like providing government to the farmers meant 
Devi Lal being in the government himself, Dalits being in the 
government means Kanshi Ram being in the government. 
  When being in power becomes the means and end to one's 
being, 
then the result usually is what happened when Devi Lal took 
power or what happened to Indira Gandhi and the country when she 
became all powerful in the government. The same is happening to 
Laloo Prasad Yadav in Bihar. Kanshi does not appear to 
understand that Devi Lal had a broader and more powerful support 
base, however, he used it to gain a powerful position in the 
government for himself. How is Devi Lal doing now and what 
happened to Indira Gandhi? Whichever leader tells the people 
that his or her becoming the head of the government is the 
panacea for their ills, is only looking for power for him or 
herself. Such leaders do not help the people. Instead, just like 
Bhasmasur [a mythological character] they destroy themselves. 
What happened to Devi Lal will happen to Kanshi Ram soon. You 
will see! 
  I am saying this not just because when the goal is only to 
gain power and position, it is self-destructive. The other 
reason is that the government of religious groups or a 
narrow-minded government of small factions just can not succeed 
in this country. Only a government with popular support can be 
stable. A government based on confrontation and dissension 
collapses like a sand castle in no time. The Marxists said, 
"Laborers of India, unite! You have nothing to lose except your 
chains." The Indian workers never united to form a government. 
The farmers were later told to unite and make a government. The 
farmers have not yet formed their government. The farmers and 
the laborers were asked to unite and make their own government. 
They neither united nor did they form a government of their own. 
  Later, in the seventies, all non-Congress parties succeeded 
in forming their own government. It did not last two and a half 
years. After 12 years, a government representing the lower and 
middle castes was formed. It did not last even one year. Then, 
they tried to unite the people over religion to form a 
government. By inciting caste-related memories and religious 
emotions, they created a paralyzing atmosphere. Even religion 
could not provide stability to the leaders in the government. 
Now Kanshi Ram is pitting the Dalits, backward castes, and 
minorities against the high caste people and other exploiters in 
order to win himself a government position. He is having various 
castes fighting with each other at different places. He has only 
68 seats and is just a junior partner in the government. He has 
no clout in any other state or the Parliament. What will happen 
to him in the next election? Now, he is stating; You will see us 
in 10 states next year and at the Center the year after that! 
  We have many or rather innumerable castes. None of these 
castes is spread through the whole nation. Those castes that are 
in every region are not equally powerful in these regions. Any 
caste that is powerful in one state could be very weak in 
another. A caste could be able to rule in one place and could be 
just a server in another. Neither Brahmans nor Rajputs ever 
ruled the whole nation. Not only have middle and backward castes 
ruled at one time, but even aborigine groups like Gond, Bhil, 
Bhilale, Muiya and Santals have also ruled. A caste, a coalition 
of castes, groups or an organized group cannot rule the whole 
nation. Those who know their religion and know the caste system 
of their society did not try to rule the whole nation in the 
name of religion or caste. If a religion or caste did gain 
power, however, their government was stable because they 
cooperated with other religions and castes and had a broad 
social base for supporting their government. The country has 
functioned well by the cooperation of opposing forces and not by 
creating tension and confrontations among groups. 
  When Chandra Shekhar said that many politically illiterate 
people like Mayavati have emerged, he did not mean that these 
upstarts have read neither Gandhi nor Ambedekar. He means that 
these people do not understand the government of this country or 
the disposition and character of the social, economic, and moral 
bases that give it stability. One can seize power for the sake 
of gaining power, however, one cannot maintain it without giving 
cohesion to the broad political, social, economic, and moral 
missions. Kanshi Ram does not have such a broad mission. The 
pathetic man thinks that he will get into government by having 
the lower castes fight with the so-called high castes. He will 
have the Indian society bathe in the blood of caste friction. 
The political parties are not exposing his deceitful ploys 
because they are afraid of losing Dalit votes. Who is afraid of 
Kanshi Ram? Only those who have become shallow because of their 
involvement in corruption. A small rag does not a cloth market 
fill. What happens when one keeps repeating Allah, Allah? If you 
do not know, go ask Kabir [poet who ridiculed dogmatism].

<F P=106> [Article by Malik Asgar Hashmi: "Let Someone Remember </F>
Central Bihar"] 
  [Text] The Jharkhand parties now and then get the whim to 
have an separate Jharkhand and engage in economic boycotts. 
Whenever they get such impulses, they totally destroy one part 
of Bihar. During this period, government property is destroyed 
methodically. Education in schools and colleges is stopped for 
this reason. Travel is disrupted for weeks, buses and trucks are 
burned, and roads and rail tracks are destroyed. Banks and post 
offices are repeatedly made ugly by this destruction. Why do the 
Jharkhand parties do this? When they are questioned about it, 
they declare their actions to be valid by saying that they need 
a separate Jharkhand and their economic boycotts to put the 
pressure on the government. 
  Interestingly, since independence these leaders have been 
demanding a separate Jharkhand composed of at least 16 
tribal-majority districts. However, they have not been 
successful in getting their demand accepted to this date. 
Instead, each time they come out in the streets raising slogans 
about sealing off Jharkhand or of economic boycotts they only 
hurt themselves. Who will be affected if all education, 
transportation and government work is stopped for weeks and 
months? The people of this area, of course. 
  It is possible that Jharkhand leaders will argue when this 
question is posed that one must lose something to gain 
something. However, what will they gain? They say that the 
tribal-majority districts are comparatively backward in this 
region. The people still live in jungles there. Very little 
development work has been done here compared to other parts of 
the state. Women and laborers are exploited here. However, these 
are not the problems that can be resolved by establishing a 
separate state for the tribals. Also, which part of our country 
is free from such problems? The noise that the Jharkhand leaders 
make over this region is also useless. This area has seen a 
great change since independence. If one looks at these 16 
districts in Bihar, one will learn that ( with exceptions) there 
is no indication that these districts are more backward than 
other areas. Instead, these districts appear to be more 
developed than other parts of the state. The roads here do not 
appear to have holes like those in other districts. 
  All the major factories in Bihar are located in the 
Jharkhand 
region. 42 percent of the minerals and jungle products that are 
produced in the state come from this area. The breeze of modern 
development mostly blows in this part of the state. Most 
computer work is being done here. All the governments until now 
have done most of the development work in this region. Seeing 
this, what valid reasons do they have to give backwardness as 
the reason for a separate Jharkhand state? 
  If truth be told, it is central Bihar that has the most 
problems. if the people of this area make noises because of 
their problems, it could be considered legitimate. After 
independence, this land of Buddha, Ashoka, Chanakya, and 
Jarasandh has been most neglected. The bad condition of this 
area spread from Bhagalpur to Buxar and Patna with its 20 
million population indicates that no economic development 
project was implemented appropriately in this part of Bihar 
during the last 45 years. Whatever there was in the past has 
also been neglected. As the result of this neglect, the 
cigarette and gun factories in Munger, engine factory in 
Jamalpur, cotton mill in Gaya, stone quarry industry in 
Karbandia, Dalmia industries, cement factory in Bolia, sugar and 
rice mills in Gaya, Gushru, Barsaliganj, Bihta and Dalmia Nagar 
all have closed. 
  The irrigation system in central Bihar has also vanished 
after independence. Before independence, the major landlords and 
farmers in this region had spread a network of wells, canals, 
and irrigations ditches. After 1947, when the land was taken 
away from the landlords, they ignored the irrigation sources. 
The situation is so bad in this region that only 60 percent of 
the area has irrigation facilities. The Mosen water reservoir, 
the Northern Koyal Irrigation Plan, Dhadhar Irrigation Plan, 
Eastern Higher Sone Canal, Sarohar Canal, and the Yamuna Canal 
all have been destroyed due to lack of maintenance. 
  Except for in Patna, there is no other major railway station 
in central Bihar from where trains leave to large cities like 
Delhi and Calcutta. No new railway line was built here after 
independence. The people in this area have been feeling the need 
to have a double line between Patna and Gaya and a new railway 
line between Rajgir and Bodh Gaya. No attention has been paid to 
this need, and there appears to be little hope of anything being 
done now. 
  Two railways minister were from Bihar. One was Lalit Narayan 
Mishra and the second was George Fernandes. Both of them had 
become ministers after winning Lok Sabha seats from northern 
Bihar. Therefore, they spent more time in improving the railways 
situation in northern Bihar than in central Bihar. There always 
had been a dearth of sharp leaders from central Bihar. Most of 
the state and central cabinet members are from southern and 
northern Bihar. If one legislator from this area became a 
cabinet member by chance, he only paid attention to his own 
personal growth. The people who would let the region rot are the 
kind who get elected as ministers from this region. During the 
eighties Aurangabad's Babu Satyander Narayan Singh was appointed 
chief minister for some time. However, he did not do anything to 
help this region. 
  The slight by the politicians and neglect by the government 
have resulted in the Naxalite problem taking roots in central 
Bihar. The people in rural areas in this region hide in their 
homes after sunset. Major landlords are especially scared of the 
Naxalites. They have formed several private armies known as the 
Sunlight army, Vir Kunwar army, Lorik army, and Diamond army 
etc. There are regular bloody skirmishes between these private 
armies and the Naxalites. The Naxalites do not hesitate to 
harass the poor. News about amputating their noses, ears, hands, 
feet, and necks come from this area often. 
  You can wonder which area should campaign for a separate 
state in such a situation. Will a region resolve all its problem 
by just forming a separate state? Another important question in 
this context is: If this region of Bihar with its mineral 
products and factories is made into a separate Jharkhand, what 
will be left in the rest of Bihar?

  [Text] The NPC [Nagaland People's Council] 
secretary-general regretted the split in the party saying that 
it had once again ignited instability in Nagaland. 
  Kohima, March 11. In a significant political development, 
six 
members today withdrew support to the Nagaland People's Council 
and formed a new political party--the Nagaland Peoples Council 
Democratic Party, reports PTI. 
  The six MLAs [members of Legislative Assembly]--Mr. P. 
Enyei, 
Mr. W. Eyong, Mr. R.T.P. Manlem, Mr. Sedem Khaming, Mr. Chenlom 
and Mr. K. Imlong--today informed the Speaker, Mr. Neiba Ndang, 
about the withdrawal of support and formation of the new party. 
  The splinter group of the NPC fulfils the criterion of 
forming a new party under the anti-defection law as they 
constitute one-third of the undivided NPC. 
  With the split, NPC's strength in the House of 59 has been 
reduced to 10. One seat is vacant following the recent demise of 
a NPC MLA, Shirhiu. 
  Meanwhile, the Nagaland People's Council secretary-general, 
Mr. Shurhozelie, regretted today's split in the party saying 
that it had once again ignited instability in Nagaland. 
  In a Press statement issued here, Mr. Shurhozelie, also the 
deputy leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly, said the 
split was not surprising as the breakaway NPC group was 
bargaining with a section of the Congress(I) for quite some time. 
  UNI [United News of India] adds: the NPC (Democratic) Party 
sources claimed that their party enjoyed support from two more 
colleagues although they had not signed the letter to the 
Speaker.

  [Text] News Service. Shares in government companies and 
organizations will go on sale on the stock market, at auction, 
and through negotiations. Sales will be done after determination 
of the base sale price for cash and installment payments after a 
decision by the minister in charge of the organization making 
the transfer as to the nature of the transfers. 
  Mas'ud Roghani-Zanjani, chief of the Plan and Budget 
Organization and spokesman for the Economic Council, gave a 
press conference yesterday (Saturday) in which he announced the 
above. He discussed the procedure for making installment sales 
of transferable shares belonging to the government, the 
organizations, and the government companies in the year 1373 [21 
March 1994-20 March 1995]. 
  He said installment sales will be done at the discretion of 
the minister in charge of the transferring organization. He 
said: Installment sales will be done only in cases where the 
buyer or buyers are seeking to buy all the shares at one time. 
  The spokesman for the Economic Council discussed the 
procedure for installment payment sales to general applicants 
and company workers and managers. He said: If general applicants 
pay 30, 40, or 50 percent of the cost of the transaction for the 
company, they may pay the remainder of the price over periods of 
3, 3.5, and 4 years, respectively. 
  He discussed the fact that the cost of an installment 
payment 
transaction will be the cost of a cash sale of the shares in 
addition to the banking system's profit on installment payment 
sales in the industrial sector. He added: To provide banking 
facilities for company workers and managers, if they so desire 
and if conditions are otherwise equal with other buyers, these 
people may pay 20 percent of the price of the transaction and 
pay the remainder of the value of the shares over a period of 4 
years in the form of installment payments. 
  Continuing, he discussed the fact that the base price of the 
sale of the shares must be approved by the minister in charge of 
the organization transferring the shares. He added: The public 
must be informed about the transfer of the shares in an 
advertisement to be placed three times in one week in at least 
two high-circulation domestic newspapers and, at the discretion 
of the organization making the transfer, in the Voice and Vision 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  He said: If the organization making the transfer does not 
sell the shares within one year, the designation of a new base 
price will be the responsibility of the minister in charge. 
  He said the minister in charge of the organization making 
the 
transfer will be responsible for determining the type of 
transfer, whether by auction, negotiation or sale on the stock 
market. He said: With regard to companies, which have been 
accepted on the stock market, priority will be given to sale on 
the stock market. 
  Mr. Roghani-Zanjani discussed the procedure for determining 
the base price of shares of government companies that can be 
transferred. He said: The base price of profitable producing 
companies will be determined by dividing the company's average 
annual pretax net profit for the last three years by the rate of 
capital return, with consideration for the factors that affect 
the adjustment of profits. 
  He added: If the company's capital has increased in the year 
of the transfer of the shares or the year prior to the transfer 
of the shares due to cash earnings, 100 percent of the increased 
capital will be added to the company's total value and the sums 
kept in the company for any reason from the profits of the year 
before the transfer will be added to the company's base price. 
  The chief of the Plan and Budget Organization discussed the 
completed price of the development projects and the completed 
price for semicomplete or ready to operate projects . He said: 
If it has been more than one year since these projects went into 
operation, the Central Bank or experts will recalculate the 
completed price by adjusting the foreign exchange cost at the 
current foreign exchange price and adjusting the rial costs by 
the announced wholesale price indicator, and after approval by 
the company's general assembly, the difference obtained will be 
added to the base price of the shares. 
  He emphasized that before transferring shares the 
organizations making the transfers are required to pay any debts 
incurred by drawing cash from the Treasury for development 
projects, or they must make an agreement with the Treasury 
concerning the method of repayment.

<F P=106> [Article by Raghid al-Sulh, a Lebanese political writer and </F>
scholar: "The Arab League's Three No's"] 
  [Text] In the Arab region and some international forums, 
there is a lively debate about the future of the regional order 
in the area, including the Middle East and North Africa. The 
debate is in progress, for the most part, between three groups: 
  The "Arabism" group is seeking the preservation of the Arab 
order and action to bring it out of its current conditions and 
develop it, enabling it to withstand international, regional, 
and local threats. This group shows a special interest in the 
Arab League, seeing it as the eventual embodiment of the concept 
of an Arab regional system. It is the parent organization of all 
the Arab joint action bodies. This group is thus opposed to the 
"Middle East market," in which it sees an attempt to create a 
regional framework for Israeli domination of the area. 
  The "Middle Eastern" group calls for the replacement of the 
Arab regional system with another, Middle Eastern one, including 
both Arabs and Israelis, at first, and perhaps Turks and 
Iranians later on. This group emphasizes the economic benefits 
this project would produce and the need for it as a guarantee of 
the Arab-Israeli peace. 
  The last group proposes a third way, between these two 
courses. It seeks global and regional arrangements permitting 
the Arab system to coexist with the Middle Eastern system and 
for the Arab League to exist side by side with Middle Eastern 
joint action organizations that may be founded later. This third 
group includes some official and unofficial Arab quarters, 
chiefly the Secretariat General of the Arab League. 
  In an effort to propagate this point of view, the 
Secretariat 
General has prepared a study on the future of joint Arab action 
and the Middle East market plan, and distributed it to Arab 
ministers of finance, economy, and foreign affairs. The study 
showed the great global challenges the Arabs will face in coming 
years, especially after the signing of the GATT accord, the 
strengthening of regional or continental cooperation between the 
countries of the European Union and the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the efforts being made by the seven 
large powers to solve the unemployment problem in the 
industrialized countries. The study concluded by reaffirming the 
importance of regional cooperation in its Arab and Middle 
Eastern portions. 
  In addition, in the course of testifying to the integrity of 
the third group's point of view, the secretary general, Dr. 
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, has made statements dealing with the 
question of the Middle East market, in which he set forth the 
major ideas advanced by proponents of the idea of an 
Arab-"Middle Eastern" intermarriage, confirming the practicality 
of their plan and its rightness. 'Abd-al-Majid's point of view 
here can be summarized in the three following Arab "no's": 

  -  No privileges given to Israel after the settlement, nor 
any Israeli control in the context of the Middle East plan, 
because "it is no more than a tiny dot in the world, with 
limited resources and surrounded by an Arab world that has great 
possibilities," and "the Arabs are not naive; they will not 
accept terms imposed upon them or for Israel to have special 
status in this market." 
  -  No fear of a Middle East market on the part of the Arab 
order. 
"The future belongs to the Arab League because it is the 
expression of the sole Arab identity and the image of the 
community united by a single culture of values and traditions, 
by a single geographic expanse and shared history." 
  -  "No force or coercion in dealing with Israel." The Arab 
countries are sovereign entities and alone will define the way 
in which they will deal with the Israelis, according to their 
national interests. 

    The picture drawn by Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid's "no's" should be 
welcomed by those keen to preserve the continuation of the Arab 
regional order. It strengthens their confidence in the future, 
and their hope of developing the maintenance of their resources 
and their use in achieving a comprehensive renaissance in the 
region. This is the appearance. In substance, however, the 
position of the League's secretary general seems to back the 
point of view of the "Middle Eastern" group. How and why? 
  Protecting the regional Arab order from extinction requires 
us to define accurately the challenges it will face, and 
alerting official and unofficial Arab circles to their existence 
and their true extent, and the citizen of their effect on the 
Arabs. We must also define the methods by which we may confront 
and respond to these challenges, starting with action to unite 
the Arabs' forces to achieve this goal and firmly establish the 
collective Arab personality and revive the institutions through 
which it speaks. The Middle Easterners, by contrast, are seeking 
to keep Arab public opinion from fully comprehending these 
threats, so that they can ram their plan through without 
opposition to speak of, and with as little effort as possible. 
In this context, the Middle East market plan is offered as if it 
were a plan for coexistence rather than domination. It is, as 
one Arab active in politics has described it, a policy of 
"impoverish and rule." The positions of the Secretariat General 
of the Arab League give encouragement to the Middle Easterners 
when they ignore the threats surrounding the Arab world, and 
ignore the difference between what they hope for, and what 
actually is; between what is the Arabs' natural right, and 
actual reality. 
  Reality says that Israel may lack some raw materials and may 
rely on outside aid, as stated in the study the Secretariat 
General distributed to Arab officials, but it makes up for this 
shortcoming in many ways. It is an industrial country, while 
most Arab countries are still agricultural societies. Its 
national income is greater than that of most of its neighbors. 
Israel is more advanced than the Arabs in the industries of the 
future as well as in agriculture. Its needs for water, energy, 
raw materials, and investments do not reduce its superiority 
over the Arabs; Japan is no less in need of energy resources 
than is Israel, and Holland is no less lacking in raw materials; 
yet these defects have not hurt these two countries' economies. 
It may not be said of Holland that it is an insignificant 
country just because it has a small population, nor because its 
area is limited, or because it is compelled to import raw 
materials from abroad. 
  What is now proposed is that all doors be thrown open to 
bilateral relations between Israel and the countries of the Arab 
and Islamic region, to weaken the types of Arab joint action and 
collective bilateral Arab action. More bluntly, it is proposed 
that Israel and the Western countries deal with Arab countries 
on the basis of purely bilateral relations. The "Middle East 
market project" is the outward aspect of this reality. It is an 
outer facade that conceals an image that puts Israel into the 
center of the region and its economic, political, and military 
"core area." The Arab countries, on the other hand, become 
subject to the center, carrying out its policies and plans. We 
sensed this concept of the future at the Madrid conference, when 
Israel, and the conference sponsors, rejected the idea of a 
unified Arab delegation. Israel took steps, even in the smallest 
details, to weaken coordination among the Arab delegations, 
staying in scattered places to make cooperation and consultation 
among them difficult. These possibilities strengthen Israel's 
position economically, politically, and militarily, at the 
expense of the Arab countries, and allow it to gain economic 
prerogatives, and distinctive political roles, contrary to the 
hopes and plans of the League's secretary general. 
  These projects are not our predestined fate. It is the 
Arabs' 
right, and it is within their ability, to resist them and to 
rebuild their lost unity, to strengthen their national unity, 
and to proceed along the path of prosperity; acting, at the same 
time, to contain the danger of Israeli expansionism and 
hegemonistic ambitions, which Israeli leaders do not even hide. 
This course of Arab and international action requires hard and 
persistent work with which energetic Arab forces are familiar, 
and continual movement to change the regional and international 
status quo, which tends to tilt the balance in favor of Israel. 
The Secretariat does not ignore this aspect; on the contrary, it 
gives it high priority among its concerns, and calls for Arab 
reconciliation, the revival of Arab solidarity, and the 
reactivation of its institutions. The Secretariat is not calling 
for the realization of this goal in a merely formal way; it has 
combined the call with practical action, ongoing contacts, and 
palpable effort in order to overcome the obstacles in its way. 
Therefore the Secretariat has certain knowledge of the extent of 
the fragmentation ailing the Arab world, and the policies that 
are aimed at turning the fracture that has plagued the Arab body 
politic in the 1990's into a permanent state and stable 
condition to help in redrawing the identity of the region and 
redrawing the map. When the Arabs were in that condition, 
comparison among them was as if they were a single power "with 
great possibilities" confronting Israel "with limited 
resources"--this comparison does not stand on firm ground, and 
leads to erroneous conclusions. It spreads feelings of torpor 
and apathy in the Arab spirit, when what we need to do is to 
give the Arabs incentives to emerge from this condition. 
  The hope is that the Arabs will be free, as Dr. 
'Abd-al-Majid 
said, to draw their regional and international policies, and to 
choose, without compulsion or coercion, their own way of dealing 
with their neighbors, to define their position toward their 
enemy purely in accordance with their own interests. The 
reality, is however, entirely different. Israel was imposed on 
the Arabs by force, and the Arabs lost the Arab lands occupied 
in 1967 through war. They were compelled to attend the Madrid 
conference under force of threat. The coercion was the outcome 
of the pro-Israel Western powers' insistence on guaranteeing 
Israel's supremacy over the Arabs, individually and as a group. 
Will this policy change if the Arabs accept the Middle Eastern 
market? 
  The great powers, keen to guarantee Israel's superiority in 
war and military confrontations, and in support of its role as 
policeman of the Middle East, will work on securing its 
superiority over the Arabs on the economic scene as well. They 
will enable it to obtain broad privileges at the expense of the 
Arabs so it can play the role of regional agent for Western 
interests. Apart from that, Israel itself will not hesitate to 
use its overwhelming military superiority over the Arabs to 
obtain economic and political privileges in the region. The 
coercion and complusion used against the Arabs today to get them 
to end the Arab boycott of Israel, for free, with no reasonable 
justification, convinces us of this. 
  The Arab League's Council, which met in Cairo in September 
1993, did not agree to end any of the levels of the Arab boycott 
of Israel. This was confirmed by Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid in his 
statement in January of this year, when he said that the boycott 
would continue "because the reasons for its original imposition 
still exist." This position was quickly changed, and the boycott 
reviewed by the Arab League itself, even though the reasons for 
which it was imposed still existed. Why? Because the U.S. 
secretary of commerce asked that the issue be put on the 
Council's agenda, and because "the American administration is 
determined to end the Arab economic boycott of Israel," as U.S. 
Vice President Al Gore told the annual convention of AIPAC 
[American-Israel Public Affairs Committee] in Washington. If 
this is not compulsion and coercion, then what is? If the change 
is not proof and evidence of the distinctive role being prepared 
for Israel in the framework of the "Middle East market" plan, 
then what proof does the Arab League Secretariat need, to be 
convinced that what is needed is to inform Arab public opinion 
of the risks of this plan, rather than to minimize it?

<F P=106> [Article by Sami al-Muhanna: "Saudi Banks Begin to Receive </F>
Donations for Jerusalem"] 
  [Text] Riyadh--Official and popular circles in the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia and in the Arab and Islamic countries have 
responded to the call issued by King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, 
Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, to launch a popular donation 
campaign throughout the Kingdom to restore and rescue the 
Islamic holy sites in the venerable Jerusalem. 
  This initiative is part of the commendable efforts exerted 
by 
the Kingdom to support the Palestinian cause and to safeguard 
Islamic holy sites in the venerable Jerusalem. 
  The custodian of the two holy mosques has instructed Prince 
Salman Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, governor of Riyadh Province and 
chairman of the Popular Committee to Aid Palestinian Strugglers, 
to take charge of the popular donations campaign throughout the 
Kingdom. 
  Prince Salman has addressed a touching appeal to the Saudi 
people and to all Arab and Muslim citizens and residents, urging 
them to contribute effectively and to donate generously. 
  For this purpose, Prince Salman has established a unified 
account at all of the Kingdom's banks in order to facilitate the 
reception of donations. 
  Thirteen popular committees in the venerable Mecca, luminous 
Medina, Riyadh, Jeddah, al-Dammam, Abha, al-Qasim, al- Hasa, 
al-Ta'if, 'Ar'ar, al-Kharj, Tabuk, and al-Khafji have begun to 
receive citizens' donations that are flowing into banks during 
bank work hours from 0900-1400 and from 2100-0030. The banks 
will manage the donation accounts and will submit periodic 
reports on the progress of the campaign to Prince Salman 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz. 
  In a related development, 'Abd-al-Rahim al-Jamus, director 
of 
the Kingdom's offices of the Popular Committees to Aid 
Palestinian Strugglers, has made special statements to express 
his pride in King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz's noble initiative, 
saying, "We believe that this call will receive an immediate and 
prompt response from the Kingdom's citizens, especially since 
the campaign is led by Prince Salman Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, who has 
been chairman of the Popular Committee to Aid Palestinian 
Strugglers since 20 Dhu al-Qa'dah 1387 of the Hegira, 
corresponding to 1968. Donations have amounted to more than 1.5 
billion riyals since this committee was created. The Kingdom's 
citizens have contributed and members of the Palestinian 
community in the Kingdom, both those working in the government 
and in the private sector, have donated 5 percent of their 
salaries.

  [Text] The heinous massacre perpetrated by radical Jews at 
the Ibrahimi Mosque [Tomb of the Patriarchs] has come at a time 
when Palestinians have been in a race with time to establish 
institutions that will manage the Palestinian economy. Even 
though this incident represents a setback for the peace process, 
it clearly reflects the importance of accelerating the creation 
of these institutions so Palestinians can prove that they are 
capable of managing their daily economic life without 
intervention by the occupation authorities, keeping in mind that 
it has been decided that the Israeli administration will hand 
over the Gaza and Jericho territories on 13 April 1994. 
  The core of the Palestinian economic institutions is the 
Palestinian Economic Development and Reconstruction Agency 
[PEDRA], which has been operating temporarily from offices at 
Jerusalem's Seven Arches Hotel since mid-January, when its 
directors were appointed. In the occupied territories, PEDRA is 
headed by Hasan Abu-Lubdah, the deputy executive director for 
the occupied territories. 
  PEDRA departments consist of a projects department, a 
finance 
department, an economic policy department, and a department to 
select projects and to link non-governmental projects with 
technical aid. 
  The administrative director is Ahmad Quray', also known as 
Abu-'Ala', who is the PLO Finance Department chairman. He is 
headquartered outside the occupied territories. The agency's 
deputy executive director is Sari Nusaybah, a professor at Bi'r 
Zayt University. 
  The agency's main task is to create institutions. This 
entails establishing contacts with the World Bank and with other 
international aid-supplying organizations to get their approval 
for the appropriate structure to manage the $2 billion in aid 
that the world community has promised to provide. 
  Agency officials emphasize that the agency is independent. 
Abu-Lubdah has said that the agency will do more than just spend 
money and that it is not just a channel through which financiers 
deliver their funds. 
  The agency's final internal structure has not been announced 
to date. It is expected that the arrangements will include two 
main departments that cover project management and sector 
management. The first will be entrusted with accounts and 
auditing and the second will cover the sectors concerned with 
education and with project evaluation. 
  The agency's communications will be handled by international 
advisers who can submit regular reports to aid-providing 
organizations, because the primary concern of these 
organizations is clarity and feasibility. Even though the agency 
wishes to be independent, lenders say that it will not control 
the current financial aid infusions, but that it will select the 
projects and will prevent the entanglement of technical aid. As 
for the financial aspect of awarded contracts, it will be within 
the jurisdiction of the aid-providing countries. 
  One of the agency's fundamental tasks is to draft the new 
administration's budget for the first five years. This was 
agreed at a meeting held in Paris between the advisory group 
representing the aid-providing parties and the Palestinians on 
28 January 1994. 
  The agency has set the 1994 budget at nearly $268 million. 
This includes the wages of 22,000 civil employees who will take 
over responsibility from the Israeli administration. The budget 
also covers the expenses of new agencies, such as the police 
force, which is expected to consist of 8,000 members. A sum of 
$137 million will be provided for special expenditures, which 
will not show up in the annual budget, because this sum is 
designated for the preliminary expenses of creating the 
administrative authority. This sum also covers a program to 
rehabilitate prisoners and provide jobs. It is expected that the 
budget deficit will amount to $158 million. The aid-providing 
parties have pledged to cover 75 percent of this deficit. 
  It is also expected that excess funds will be channeled 
toward special expenditures rather than current expenditures. 
  Moreover, it is expected that the administration will 
collect 
revenues of $250-$300 million in taxes to cover current 
expenditures and will resort to domestic borrowing to balance 
the budget. 
  An important priority will be to set up a tax-collection 
authority to take over from the Israeli administration on 13 
April 1994. 
  PEDRA has been criticized by the aid-providing countries for 
its failure to create a tax-collection authority fast enough. 
PEDRA has to deal with this issue promptly. 
  In addition to PEDRA, plans have been announced recently to 
create a Palestinian development organization to develop 
economic ideas. 
  Nabil Qassis, one of PEDRA's directors, is drafting a plan 
for this organization that will operate independently of PEDRA 
and that will compile data on trade, currency, financial issues, 
and labor issues. This organization will also have a department 
to evaluate projects. 
  The plans to establish this organization have received 
financing from the World Bank and have been accepted by the 
aid-providing countries. Middle East affairs specialists at the 
World Bank have said that this organization will work 
side-by-side with PEDRA and with the Palestinian Statistics 
Bureau, headquartered in Damascus. 
  A preliminary plan has been drafted to set up a Palestinian 
development bank, and it awaits the approval of PLO Executive 
Council Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. The bank, expected to have a 
capital of $200 million, will be an independent establishment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Abdelhak Benhamouda, secretary general of </F>
the General Union of Algerian Workers, by Ahmed Ancer; place and 
date not given: "`If the State Does Not Assume Its 
Responsibility, the Law of the Strongest Will Prevail'"; first 
paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] Speaking at a particularly complex and 
difficult juncture, the secretary general of the UGTA [General 
Union of Algerian Workers], Abdelhak Benhamouda, does not mince 
words in describing the behavior of the political class. 
  [Ancer] What is your analysis of the current political 
situation? 
  [Benhamouda] To make an analysis, there must be a political 
situation--with at least some data--to analyze. I think that we 
are going through a bad spell, so we can only speak of an 
observation. It may be objective or subjective. But there is a 
reality. 
  For my part, I am one of those very numerous Algerians who 
defend the state. It is the state which, by being strong, takes 
charge of defending the country and protecting the citizens and 
their property. But what we are seeing is the total absence of 
the state. We also see that the people who used to talk about 
democracy, dialogue, "rahma" [compassion], tolerance, and human 
rights are the ones now defending criminals, terrorists, 
killers, and assassins. 
  We see total silence on the part of the public authorities, 
the so-called political class, and the human rights associations 
while hundreds of Algerians have been murdered just during this 
month of Ramadan. 
  Even more serious, we see, as though by coincidence, that in 
a sector of the press known to be the tool of the terrorists and 
the former FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], the roles have been 
reversed: the real victims are presented as terrorists, while 
the real terrorists become the victims. There is something worse 
than that. Newspapers that are supposed to defend the republic 
and democracy have recently been turned into tools of the former 
FIS. 
  We have the impression, and it is also a profound feeling, 
that the only one concerned by this struggle is the citizen: the 
unarmed civilian. I often hear it said: "Where is civil society? 
We have no people, no citizens." But I ask two questions. The 
first is addressed to the public authorities. Why is the state, 
which disarmed the citizens, now asking them to stand up to 
unscrupulous criminals? Doesn't the state exist to ensure their 
safety? Unless it is incapable of doing so! We draw the 
following conclusions from such a situation: people are telling 
themselves that if the state cannot live up to its obligations, 
then the citizens are entitled to defend themselves by their own 
means. 
  For six years, the political class has been abusing and 
terrorizing the people. Now, despite that, even the parties that 
protect or justify terrorism, thus ensuring it of political 
cover, are being threatened because of contradictory interests. 
  The political class, whether in power or--in quotes--the 
"opposition," is asking where civil society is. Judging from the 
case of Ait Ahmed, civil society does not even have the right to 
defend itself. Unless it is supposed to wait for "Mehdi 
al-Montazer" [Hidden Iman] to come from Lausanne and defend it. 
  The problem at present is that the overwhelming majority of 
Algerians are threatened, not just the members of the security 
services or the people expressing political stands. The 
terrorists are now murdering women, little girls, old men and 
women, workers, teachers, peasants, the unemployed, and so on. 
They are burning down schools, food units, industrial complexes, 
and so on. 
  In short, they are destroying the entire country. Where is 
the concern on the part of the so-called opposition parties over 
such a situation? Where is action by the state in the face of 
such monstrous crimes? It should be pointed out in this 
connection that it is not the state that is hunting down 
terrorists. It is the latter who are, for example, assaulting a 
Gendarmerie station and organizing attacks in various places. 
But if they do not do anything, they are not disturbed. 
  It is for all those reasons that the public is looking for 
the best way to protect itself on its own. Mass action must 
achieve two objectives: it must not be co-opted for the benefit 
of the mafia still existing within the apparatuses, and at the 
same time, it must strengthen the state's action. This is 
important because if we step outside the framework of the state, 
we become outlaws, and then no one will be governing anyone. We 
hope that those limits will not be exceeded, especially now that 
dialogue is being resumed. 
  [Ancer] What exactly is your opinion of the results of that 
dialogue? 
  [Benhamouda] In my opinion, it is more a matter of 
concessions. For example, every time there are clemency 
measures, the response by the terrorists is hundreds of 
Algerians being executed. The last time it happened--when 
leaders of the former FIS were released--the terrorists carried 
out the spectacular operation at Tazoult Prison. Judging from 
the information available so far, it seems unlikely that only 
two guards were in on it. 
  [Ancer] Does this mean you are thinking of high-level 
accomplices? 
  [Benhamouda] Yes! You will notice that no one has accepted 
responsibility, just as no one has resigned to at least keep up 
appearances. The political situation constitutes a whole. It is 
not limited to the management of security or to dialogue, which 
we do not believe in, at least not in the way that it is being 
conducted. 
  There is not even any communication. Take the example of the 
negotiations with the IMF. All anybody knows is that individuals 
are in Washington. But we know nothing about what they are 
doing. Public opinion is not being informed. There is not even a 
communique, despite the fact that the country's future is bound 
up with the results of those negotiations. 
  [Ancer] What do you think of dialogue "with none excluded" 
as 
reaffirmed this Friday by Liamine Zeroual? 
  [Benhamouda] It is a problem. For myself, I understand it 
this way: there are people who feel responsible for the blood 
that is flowing because it is not compulsory to blame the one 
causing it--the one doing the killing. Responsibility is placed 
on the politician who pushed the terrorist groups to kill. 
  Let us accept that no one is to be excluded. Thousands of 
Algerians have been victims of the terrorists. They have ties 
with hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of relatives and 
friends who are demanding justice. So there is a blood problem 
to be solved. We can talk about dialogue "with none excluded," 
but only after resolving the matter of the blood that has been 
shed, and every terrorist must pay. If that portion of the 
public that still believes in the state and in legality does not 
obtain justice, it will rebel. 
  It seems to me that the people who think it is possible to 
have dialogue without excluding anyone in order to solve the 
problems of terrorism and security do not live in Algeria or in 
Algerian society. 
  So they are greatly mistaken. It seems to me that there is a 
lot of manipulation going on, and what is more serious, we 
resent the fact that they are trying to present us with a fait 
accompli. Whichever group is acting in that manner is moving in 
the wrong direction. 
  [Ancer] It is the women who are reacting now to the 
disturbing situation in the country. How can one explain what 
could be called hesitation on the part of the UGTA at such a 
serious moment? 
  [Benhamouda] It is not a matter of hesitation, and we have 
our positions. It must not be forgotten that our organization 
has suffered many attacks aimed at destabilizing and destroying 
it on the grounds that the central union and Benhamouda in 
particular are engaging in politics and ignoring union activity. 
That is certainly false. There is no hesitation. We are 
observing the course of events. 
  [Ancer] We asked that question because at several important 
moments in the life of our country, especially when the CNSA 
[National Committee for the Safeguard of Algeria] was being 
established and when preparations were being made for the march 
on 22 March 1993, the UGTA played a leading role. And now 
Algeria is experiencing a very dangerous situation. 
  [Benhamouda] The UGTA has stepped back and is observing. So 
far no one has made a move. No one has lifted a finger or 
denounced or condemned anything. There are no longer even any 
notices of condolences in the newspapers. That just shows how 
far cowardice has gone. Some political parties do not express 
those condolences even to the families of their own murdered 
members. Let us talk about 22 March, when millions of people 
took to the streets in response to the call from the UGTA and 
other associations. They did not do so to make social demands 
despite the very difficult living conditions of the workers and 
other groups. They were all chanting slogans about halting 
terrorism and halting the assassination of Algeria. They were 
all demanding a state of law, a republic with its values, 
freedom, pluralism, democracy, and so on. 
  For my part, I do not know exactly who heads the FFS 
[Socialist Forces Front], and it does not concern me. But in any 
case I do not understand why somebody named Khellil, speaking 
from the rostrum at a general meeting by his party, is targeting 
me in particular. Those who target the UGTA say that we are in 
the pay of the government. They have accused us of being 
responsible for halting the election process, the action that 
caused Chadli's downfall. Some people make a living from lies. 
If we supported Chadli's government, how did it happen that we 
played a part in bringing it down? 
  On the question of dialogue, the UGTA took clear positions, 
regardless of whether it was talking to the HCE [Higher State 
Council] or the commission, even to the point of saying that all 
the window dressing had to be removed. Because if the window 
dressing is not removed, people will not be able to see who is 
pulling the strings behind the scenes. We wanted to know where 
the real power was. That is the UGTA which, speaking through its 
secretary general, denounces the government, the symbols of 
corruption, and the mafia. 
  So where is the hesitation? The UGTA does not want political 
power, too. The workers are suffering, but despite that their 
first concern is the fate of Algeria. It is not our problems but 
the defense of the country that is taking center stage. We could 
have adopted a negative attitude, considering the seriousness of 
the problems in the world of labor. 
  We might have been tempted to struggle for power so that 
even 
if we were unable to take it, we could still break the country 
and make everyone equal in misery. But no, our concern has 
always been to help make the state of law a reality. 
  There are certain things that I am not going to talk about 
because I do not want to demoralize people. Let us talk instead 
about the state. In the government departments and state 
enterprises, people are going back to the beard and "kamis" 
[shirt]. They stop work and go off supposedly to say their 
prayers. In some mosques--I am not talking about the interior of 
the country but about Algiers--virulent speeches with invectives 
and insults are reappearing. This is true even on television, 
where the sermons have been just as virulent as those by the 
terrorists during this Ramadan. Despite all that, no one has 
eyes and ears for anything except the UGTA. 
  [Ancer] The negative view is actually not the only one. 
People look to the central union because it remains the only 
organization with nationwide influence. 
  [Benhamouda] I was getting to that. Although from the 
organizational standpoint, everything is relative. That being 
said, our concern is to make people appear as they really are. 
Now that we have had the communique from the president, we will 
see how the political parties react. As far as we are concerned, 
we have done all we could. But there is manipulation. 
  [Ancer] Are you afraid of attempts at co-optation, as 
happened following the marches in March 1993? 
  [Benhamouda] There is always manipulation. That is why it is 
absolutely necessary to establish a genuine and permanent 
popular movement. In the second place, there are a lot of 
volunteers. If the state wants that to be legal, let it hand out 
weapons. Otherwise people will get them some other way. Any 
popular political movement that matters must be able to protect 
itself. If the state takes charge of the security problem, 
people will organize peacefully. If the state does not accept 
its responsibilities, the law of the strongest will prevail /tag 
aala men tag/. [preceding words published in Arabic] 
  [Ancer] But in that case there would be civil war--it would 
mean something terrible happening to the country! 
  [Benhamouda] We do not want it. We do not want it. That is 
why I say over and over that only the state has the right to use 
force. I have always said that. But if the state does not use 
its strength to defend the citizens, who is going to do so--who 
is going to defend the innocent? We have not reached any 
decision. 
  We are in the process of getting together as union leaders 
to 
consider how to go about it. Because after all, if you are going 
to die, you should certainly take your enemy with you. We need 
to keep in mind the kinds of atrocities they are committing. The 
terrorists went to the home of a gendarme, and when they could 
not find him, they killed his wife and sister-in-law. They kill 
women and a 14-year-old girl. They kill people in front of 
innocent children. How long are we going to put up with that? 
  If we get to that point, there will no longer be political 
parties or personalities. It will be every man for himself. We 
cannot just stand around with our arms crossed. Who are we 
waiting for? 
  Who? The tragedy of this country is that one person uses 
history and another uses religion to say: "I am a party." Then a 
third person comes along with neither troops nor trumpet and 
speaks in the name of the Algerian people on who knows what 
authority to exclude civil society at a time when intellectuals 
are living in hiding in their own country. So the state must 
accept its responsibilities in order to avoid civil war. There 
must not be a return to the practices of the HCE, in which there 
is dialogue with parties that justify terrorism by insulting 
everyone. We have already wasted a year and a half for nothing. 
We have already paid. And if we have to pay even more, will we 
not be tempted to burn the country down? People have suffered 
too much. Some, like Guendouzi, have died with their wages 
suspended. It is possible to play with everything except 
people's lives. The right to life is sacred. 
  Concerning the women who have decided to rally in front of 
the ONDH [National Human Rights Organization], they could just 
as well have done so in front of the office of the president or 
some other important institution. In my opinion, they chose the 
ONDH because human rights associations exist to defend 
terrorists, murderers, and criminals. I do not recall any 
communique from an association calling for the enforcement of 
court decisions. 
  But that is a right. The same is true of health at a time 
when hundreds of threatened physicians have fled the country, 
but we have not heard anything from the human rights 
associations on that subject. In my opinion, that is the 
symbolism of the women's choice. They are defending the right to 
life in order to arouse people's consciences. If there is no 
response, it will mean that there is no more conscience.
