  [Excerpts] The Ministry of Industrial Restructuring and 
Participation came into existence with the new government 
formation. As soon as it was announced that this ministry was 
entrusted to Mourad Benachenhou, the minister of economy in the 
former government and the one who engineered the agreement with 
the IMF, the media and the general trade union rushed and said 
that it was a ministry of privatization. 
  Mourad Benachenhou, who was today's guest on the Algerian 
Radio 3 Transitions program, tried to dismiss this idea and 
pointed out that his ministry was charged with a mission that 
had a character of conception and analysis of the current 
situation of the industrial, distribution, and tourism sectors. 
Our colleague Benahmimed has more details. 
  [Begin Benahmimed recording] Mr. Benachenhou stressed that 
his ministry would carry out the duty of putting forward 
proposals on the ways and means of restructuring these sectors 
and increasing their productivity level. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Michel Camdessus, the director general of the IMF, at 
the 
opening of the spring session of the annual general meeting of 
the World bank and the IMF talked about the agreements signed 
lately, including the Algerian model. In this context, Mr. 
Camdessus described the Algerian Government's program for 
economic revival as strong and stressed the activating role of 
the IMF in giving incentives for the necessary financing in 
order to bring about this revival. 
  France yesterday announced once again, through Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe, its solidarity with Algeria. Juppe also 
expressed his country's satisfaction with the fact that the 
other European partners expressed the same. He mentioned that 
there is a spontaneous European initiative stipulating that 150 
million ECUs [European currency units] will be granted to 
Algeria. [end recording]

  [Text] Today's main event in the world is the International 
Day of Freedom of the Press. The event is important given the 
number of measures, some with tragic consequences, facing 
journalists throughout the world. 
  The French watchdog group Reporters Sans Frontieres has 
announced that more than 60 journalists have been killed 
throughout the world since the New Year. The American Freedom 
House Society has asserted that, despite the gains made by 
journalists throughout the world, hurdles facing freedom of the 
press continue to exist in more than 100 countries. 
  In Algeria, in addition to the aforementioned pressures, 
journalists have been facing the risk of assassination; 14 of 
our colleagues have been victims of the violence in our country. 
  On this occasion Mr. Mohamed Benamar Zerhouni, minister of 
communications, today made the following statement to the 
national radio: 
  [Begin Zerhouni recording] I cannot, on this symbolic 
occasion, but offer my prayers to all those who have been slain 
as they were carrying out their noble mission. Indeed, they 
were some of the best people who gave their life trying to do 
their job the best possible. 
  I would like also to salute and pay respect to their 
colleagues, be it journalists or other workers in the 
communication sector, and in particular those who have been 
tirelessly defending the profession of journalism and its 
freedom despite their personal suffering and other obstacles. 
Given all this, I cannot but stand by their side to condemn 
everything that might harm the freedom of expression and 
personal sacrosanct rights. [end recording] 
  The minister took this opportunity to invite all journalists 
to organize themselves through their own trade unions: 
  [Begin Zerhouni recording] I would like to take this 
opportunity to call upon all publishers of newspapers and other 
publications, as well as all members of the two wings of the 
national press, to join in trade unions where they will be 
bonded by their common interest. Once such unions are set up, 
people who will truly represent them in their open, continuous, 
and frank dialogue with public authorities will emerge. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Water is life. Irrigation in our country requires 
stimulation, such as modernizing drinking water networks and 
building dams and other projects. 
  The time is ripe and a loan is coming at the right time. In 
the meeting of the provinces' irrigation directors, an official 
at the Equipment Ministry reported on foreign financing 
estimated at $1.025 billion. Ahmed Megache has the details: 
  [Megache] Financing of irrigation projects in Algeria 
estimated at $1.025 billion in the form of loans was revealed 
yesterday by an official at the Equipment Ministry before the 
national meeting of the directors of irrigation. 
  The same source pointed out that the irrigation sector has 
been benefiting for years from foreign financial aid, 
particularly provided by the institutions of the International 
Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Investment 
Bank, and Arab funds. 
  As the ministry official pointed out, previous financing was 
devoted to building dams and networks for supplying drinking 
water in many provinces and purification for three main 
cities--Algiers, Oran, and Constantine--in addition to the water 
purification project in Boumerdes province. 
  The ministry official added that this financing also 
affected 
the modernization of the drinking water networks of 10 
provinces, with a loan from the International Bank valuing $110 
million. 
  As for the financing of the International Bank for 
Development, it would be devoted to the modernization of 24 
water purification stations, completing studies on the effect on 
the ocean, and strengthening the potentials of the water 
agencies throughout the country.

<F P=106> [Article by Wajih Abu-Zikra: "Hegemony or Peace </F>
Israeli-Style"] 
  [Text] Professor Ibrahim Sa'dah has posed, in his article, 
"Welcome to the Challenge," a highly significant, momentous, and 
insightful question: What will be Egypt's position if Israel 
realizes its dreams of a new "warm" peace with all the Arabs, as 
distinct from the "cold" peace with Egypt? 
  I believe the answer to this question will be the linchpin 
of 
political action in the near future, and for years to come. In 
order for the answer to the question to be efficacious, I 
believe AKHBAR AL-YAWM, in cooperation with a research 
organization, should hold a conference in which Egypt's 
scientists and political and intellectual leaders take part in 
adopting a "strategic Egyptian plan" for facing the coming 
challenge. The plan would include a method for managing the 
"coming peace struggle" primarily in Egyptian, and, secondarily, 
in Arab terms. Every party to the conflict has its own vision of 
the post-peace phase. 
  Israel: Israel sees, in this peace, the second 
phase of Israel's evolution. The first phase was the 
establishment of the state itself; it was established, and 
expanded gradually, to enter into the phase of hegemony over the 
region. This was proclaimed by Ben-Gurion in the 1950s, to be a 
regulation for all the Israeli leaders who came after him, doves 
and hawks alike. Ben-Gurion said, "Peace is essential for Jewish 
genius to gain control over Arab money and Arab labor, in order 
for this genius to put both (money and labor) to the best use." 
Israel began early to initiate studies, research, and projects 
preparatory to the peace phase. Israeli espionage agencies and 
research institutions specialized in studying and gathering 
information about Arab capabilities in all areas. I may mention 
one interesting incident that occurred at the book fair. 
Specialized national councils exhibited volumes containing 
Egyptian scientists' views on internal Egyptian affairs, on 
housing, agriculture, Nile water, and livestock, in addition to 
issues of extremism and deviance. The Embassy of Israel alone 
bought more than one copy of each volume, to make use of them in 
post-peace planning. 
  Israel keeps silent about "cooperation in the context of 
peace," as well as about its maneuvers in international finance 
organizations. Despite that, some studies on the Israeli concept 
of peace have emerged from the realm of secrecy. There was--one 
of countless examples--the outcome of an economic conference 
held at the University of Tel Aviv entitled "Economic 
Cooperation in the Middle East, From a Dream to Reality." Hayyim 
Ben-Shahar urged this and included it in a book published in 
London in 1989, called Economic Cooperation in the Middle 
East. In the view of that conference: 
  Israel suffers from a water shortage, and the water 
surpluses 
of the Nile River, the Litani River in Lebanon, and al-Yarmuk 
River [in Jordan] are being lost to evaporation. The conference 
view was of Israel's "need" to benefit from these waters. 
  The conference proposed the extension of the Tapline to 
Haifa; this junction would be 40 percent cheaper than traversing 
the Suez Canal. 
  They speak of developing Arab-on-Arab wars, and linking them 
to the Israeli arms trade. 
  Israel has submitted several Middle East development 
projects 
to the World Bank, on condition that they involve more than one 
country in the region, with Jewish "genius" being the key point 
of each. The projects included water transport, electricity 
transport, the establishment of ports, the extension of 
railroads, and a network of roads linking Israel and the Arab 
states. 
  Israel's problem is that the pivotal Israel philosophy in 
regional cooperation is hegemony. 
  The Oil Arabs: After Saddam's invasion of Kuwait 
and the fact that some Arab countries supported the invasion, 
and the PLO's support for that cruel attack, there was a radical 
change, and a 180 degree turn in the minds of the "oil Arabs." 
They renounced Arabism; they renounced the Palestinian cause; 
they imagined that Israel was closer to them and easier to take 
than their "treacherous Arab neighbor." Israel, they imagined, 
was a powerful country, capable of offering them help and 
protection against the perfidiousness of friends and brothers. 
With the encouragement of the United States, they secretly 
rushed to Israel to sign trade deals and get their sick treated 
in Israeli hospitals. The Israeli press has even begun to call 
Hadassah Hospital the Rich Arab Patients Hospital. Israel has 
respected the Arabs' wish for secrey in their visits and 
cooperation. Then there was the Gaza-Jericho agreement, 
dispensing even with the fig leaf, with the beginning of a phase 
of openness and pride in the agreement and visits to Israel. We 
began to read, in Gulf newspapers, about the need to nullify the 
Arab boycott of Israel at all its levels. Trade with Israel has 
begun in many Gulf countries, and all this has begun even before 
a comprehensive peace or the return of the occupied Arab land. 
The thing that defies human understanding is that one 
"revolutionary" Arab country, rejects the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
and Camp David and all forms of negotiations with the Israeli 
"enemy." This country got Israel to produce water pipes for one 
of its huge water projects, and oil pipelines too; Israeli 
factories are working night and day to meet that country's needs. 
  The Palestinians: I was utterly surprised at the 
Palestinians' ebullient feelings about 'Arafat's outstretched 
hand and Rabin's hesitant one at the White House festivities for 
the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord. Then the Palestinians 
began a free-for-all to announce Palestinian-Israeli cooperation 
to the Israeli media. "Combatant" Palestinian leaders thrust 
themselves in front of Israeli television cameras to talk about 
"the friendly Israeli people." I felt that the Palestinians and 
the Israelis were speaking one language in which I was not 
fluent--which I did not even understand; that they were on the 
same side, against the Egyptian concept of peace. Our peace, in 
the opinion of Prof. Ibrahim Sa'dah, is a cold peace, while the 
Israelis and Palestinians have a torrid peace! As if what has 
happened over the last half century was a mere tempest in a 
teacup; as if we had just been meddling in someone else's 
business all that time. I was even more surprised when I heard 
one of the leaders of the Palestinian "struggle" use an 
expression that nauseated me, saying that "Israel is an 
honorable enemy; the Arabs are treacherous friends." 
  The Syrians: Some of them believe the Syrian 
presence in Lebanon is far more important and beneficial than 
the Syrian presence on the Golan, because the Golan--as one of 
them put it--is a desolate area, whereas Lebanon is Syria's true 
outlet to the Mediterranean Sea; thus any peace accord requiring 
the Syrians to stay out of Lebanon would be unacceptable, even 
if it liberated the Golan. 
  This is a brief look at Israel's dreams, and of the Arab 
political circus, which gives special importance to writer 
Ibrahim Sa'dah's big question: What will be Egypt's position if 
Israel realizes its dreams of a new "warm" peace with all the 
Arabs, as distinct from the "cold" peace with Egypt? 
<H5>  Yes, Egypt. </H5>
  Egypt today is demanding a correction in the Arabs' course, 
their attention to detail, and some understanding on the part of 
those who are rushing blindly toward Israel. Only Egypt will 
stand by the Arabs; only Egypt will stand against Israeli 
hegemony in the region; only Egypt will turn hegemony into 
cooperation between partners. Hence my proposal at the beginning 
of this article, about the need for the questioner to hold a 
scientific conference in which we would call upon Egyptian 
genius to set us an Egyptian strategy for managing the coming 
peace struggle. 
  Yes, through that conference we would get a plan for 
rebuilding this region on new bases, or, in other words, a 
"strategy for thwarting Israel's plan for hegemony," especially 
as Egypt has intellectual, human, geographical, and material 
resources greater than Israel's, and these scattered resources 
must be gathered into a single order so that we need not fear 
cooperation with Israel. This proposal could be submitted to the 
Arab nation at an Arab summit, as Prof. Ibrahim Sa'dah asked. We 
would commit ourselves to it and then, subsequently, enter into 
regional cooperation with Israel--after it has withdrawn from 
the occupied territories. 
  I give warning that without a plan, and Arab solidarity with 
it, and commitment to it, then Israeli dominance is on the 
way--no doubt about it.

<F P=106> [Article by Husayn 'Abd-al-Razzaq: "The Party of Camp David </F>
and Humiliating Surrender"] 
  [Text] All of a sudden the rulers of Egypt--and the rulers 
of the Arabs--are hastening to establish economic relations and 
joint venture projects with Israel, all under the aegis of 
"normalization" and peace, preparatory to the abandonment of the 
Council of the Arab League's resolution to continue applying the 
boycott "at all its levels." 
  In Cairo, the "heroes" of Camp David are acting shamelessly 
and with no effort to disguise what they are doing to us and to 
the Arab nation. 
  Last October (1993), our master cancelled the security 
restrictions that had been imposed on Egyptians traveling to 
Israel, including the requirement for them to obtain prior 
permission to travel, as from the first of November. 
  Then an agreement was signed by the governments of Egypt, 
Israel, and Turkey for the establishment of a three-country 
tourism organization. 
  Ater visiting Egypt and meeting with the president and the 
minister of petroleum, Israeli energy minister, Moshe Shahal, 
announced the Egyptian Government's agreement, in principle, to 
supply Israel with nearly 250 million cubic feet of natural gas 
per day, for 25 years, beginning in 1998. 
  In President Husni Mubarak's meeting with writers and 
intellectuals at the book fair, he announced his agreement to 
sell natural gas to Israel in pipelines passing through the 
northern Sinai, and to a petroleum refining plant project worth 
$85 million, in which Israel would participate, and which would 
be supplied with Arab (Gulf and Saudi) oil. 
  In the Peoples Assembly, Dr. Yusuf Wali defended the Israeli 
role in Egyptian agriculture. 
  The "Camp David party" marketed this exuberance for, and 
surrender to Israel, with the slogan of turning the "cold peace" 
that has existed since the Camp David accords and peace treaty 
between al-Sadat and Begin (1979), into a "warm peace" in light 
of Arab and global developments, and the Israeli-Palestinian 
declaration of principles (the "Gaza-Jericho first" agreement). 
  It did not stop there. In accordance with President 
Mubarak's 
"directives," frantic steps have been taken to establish this 
"warm peace." 
  In the last week of February, talks were held in Cairo 
between Egyptian and Israeli delegations of oil experts to study 
the subject of supplying Israel with natural gas, and to make 
use of Egyptian drilling companies in the Israeli oil business. 
The talks dealt with the practical steps for extending gas 
pipelines from Port Sa'id to Israel, and funding for the 
project, which is expected to cost nearly $300 million. Funding 
will come from a new company established by the Ministry of 
Petroleum, in which the Petroleum Gases Corp. and the Italian 
firm Agip will have shares. 
  The new Minister of Reconstruction [Minister of State for 
New 
Urban Communities] Muhammad Ibrahim Sulayman has announced to 
the Housing and Reconstruction Committee in the Peoples 
Assembly, a government strategy for developing the Sinai by 
using Israeli investments. 
  The Egyptian mufti's office has been the scene of a debate 
on 
psychology, to which the Egyptian Psychology Society, headed by 
Dr. Jamal Madi Abu-al-'Azayim [name as translitrated], was 
invited, and in which a 15-member Israeli delegation took part. 
  In Casablanca, President of the Israeli Knesset Rafa'el Edri 
announced the establishment of a mixed Israeli-Egyptian-Moroccan 
company to set up an air link between Morocco and Israel through 
Egypt, to facilitate the travel of Israeli Jews of Moroccan 
origin "who wish to visit their country, Morocco." 
  Once again there is talk--insolently, this time--of 
al-Sadat's project to dig a canal through the Sinai to bring 
Nile water to Israel. 
  Western sources link the Nile canal project with the plan to 
dig a 280-km-long canal from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea--with 
the goal of raising the standard of the Dead Sea waters and 
generating electrical energy by harnessing the movement of the 
water between the two seas--and a third project for digging a 
canal from the Dead Sea to the Mediterrean Sea. These sources 
say that the Italian Government has announced its readiness to 
fund the feasibility study for the Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal 
project after Jordan, Egypt, Israel, and the Palestinian 
authority gave their consent, and the construction of a huge 
port between the port of 'Aqabah and the Eilat on the route of 
the new canal. 
  According to the Israeli study, the cost of digging the 
three 
proposed canals will range from $750 million to $1.5 billion for 
each canal. The project also includes the installation of water 
treatment stations whose cost is estimated at near $1 billion, 
which would produce nearly 1 billion cubic meters of potable 
water annually. 
  As these sources say: "The project is one of a group of 
projects studied by the World Bank, aimed at securing economic 
assimilation and interconnection in the Middle East." The World 
Bank, in cooperation with the United States and Germany, will 
take part in funding the research and feasibility studies. 
  And the frantic Egyptian rush toward normalization--or more 
accurately into the trap of linkage, assimilation, and 
interconnection with Israel and the Middle Eastern market--has 
been accompanied by a parallel Arab rush. 
  Qatar announced, through its Foreign Minister Hamad 
Bin-Jasim 
Bin-Jabbur Al Thani, that its government was holding preliminary 
talks with Israel on a huge project for exporting gas to Israel 
and to Europe through Israel. The project cost is estimated at 
nearly $2 billion. 
  Casablanca has received an Israeli delegation led by deputy 
Rafa'el Edri, president of the Israeli Knesset, to take part in 
the International Assembly of Jews of Moroccan Origin. This was 
a new step in the growing economic, commercial, and political 
relations between Morocco and Israel, especially in the areas of 
agriculture, transport, and tourism. Moroccan businessmen and 
government officials have made several visits to Israel recently. 
  Jordanian and Tunisian delegations have visited Israel to 
discuss opportunities for future cooperation. 
  Political circles expect the Arab League Council to study an 
American request this month that it lift the Arab boycott of 
Israel at the third level, which bans international companies 
from doing business with Israel. The U.S. secretary of commerce 
made this request on his visit to Cairo on 21 January. After his 
visit to to Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Israel, Ronald Brown 
announced that "Arab countries will soon announce an end to the 
boycott of Israel." 
  The fact that the secretary general of the Arab League put 
this on the agenda of the League Council for its 101st session 
(March 1994) drew mixed reactions, especially as the League 
Council had made a resolution last 22 November to maintain the 
Arab boycott of Israel at all levels. 
  This sad story concluded with Shim'on Peres' announcment, 
during the press conference he and 'Arafat held in Davos, 
Switzerland, about holding a conference in Amman, Jordan, to 
study the economic future of the Middle East. The Israeli media 
pointed out that this conference was being planned by "the 
global economic community" and the U.S. Council of Foreign 
Relations. Dennis Ross and Richard Murphy are to play major 
roles in it, and no less than 4,000 officials, managers, and 
CEOs will take part, representing the global economic elite. A 
number of heads of state may attend, among them Clinton, 
Mitterrand, Major, Kohl, and Hosokawa, as it is seen as a global 
summit conference on development in the Middle East. 
  These events, which are occurring under the aegis of 
normalization, or the Middle Eastern market, or the development 
of the Middle East, or peace, are all aimed at securing Israel's 
future in light of the American-Israeli peace imposed on this 
region, which is certainly not the just and comprehensive peace 
we speak of. 
  What is now occurring is clearly aimed at establishing a 
formula for regional cooperation at the political, cultural, and 
economic levels, not merely to achieve total Arab and 
Palestinian recognition of the legitimacy of the Israeli 
state--founded upon the usurpation of part of the land of 
Palestine in 1948--within secure and recognized borders. It 
offers Israel the elements of a life of plenty, on Arab 
resources, and imposes the establishment of a neo-colonialist 
Middle Eastern system that protects the imperialist interests of 
the United States and its allies. It safeguards Israel, for its 
part, as the pillar of these interests, and takes the place of 
the regional Arab system and the institutions of joint Arab 
action. It negates the idea of Arab nationalism and its slogans 
of unity, and the national Arab liberation movement. 
  For peace threatens the Israeli economy with collapse, 
unless 
it is saved by this new role planned for it through 
normalization and the Middle Eastern market. 
  Thus the real exchange Israel is proposing is not land for 
peace, but the part in exchange for the whole; the occupied 
lands in exchange for the exploitation of Arab lands and 
resources through normalization and the Middle Eastern market. 
  Will the party of Camp David stop seeing its surrender to 
the 
Zionists and the Americans as realistic and courageous and 
clear, as "traversing the rocky roads to peace"? 
  Will Egyptian and Arab nationalist forces call things by 
their names, and reject this shameful surrender? Will we bravely 
confront the catastrophe that is about to envelop us and our 
nation, that implants Israel as a leading imperialist state in 
the Arab region, in the name of normalization and the Middle 
Eastern market? 
  This is the question, which the Egyptian and Arab left, and 
all nationalist forces, must answer--and with deeds, not words.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ashraf Shams-al-Din, chairman of </F>
subcommittee on trade in services, by Najla' Dhikri; place and 
date not given: "Liberalization of International Trade in 
Services Will Realize Export Surge for Egypt"--first four 
paragraphs are AL-AHRAM AL-DUWALI introduction] 
  [Text] Liberalizing international trade in services will 
bring Egypt the as-yet-undeveloped export surge that Egypt has 
long sought to realize through goods exports. This is especially 
so because Egypt preceded most developing countries, all the 
Eastern European socialist countries, and China in following an 
economic open-door policy that led to a relative development of 
the services sector. 
  A report of the national committee monitoring the Uruguay 
Round and the permanent committee on trade in services affirms 
this. The subcommittee on trade in services will begin meeting 
next week to arrive at a final report before the agreement is 
signed this April. 
  Although many advanced and developing countries fear the 
consequences of the agreement to liberalize trade in services 
under the Uruguay agreement that is to go into effect in July 
1995, experts in Egypt state that Egypt's service 
sectors--especially finance, tourism, construction, and 
building--are ready to deal with the world through import and 
export. 
  Ashraf Shams-al-Din chairs a subcommittee of the permanent 
committee on the international agreement to liberalize trade in 
goods and services. He also heads the foreign markets and 
international cooperation section of the Financial Market 
Authority. He stated that Egypt's commitment to an economic 
reform program has effectively speeded the growth of the service 
sectors, so that they can compete on the international level. He 
indicated that these sectors would be ready to operate under the 
GATT agreement in only three years, although the agreement 
allows developing countries a period of ten years to develop 
their sectors to be consistent with GATT. 
<H5>  Relative Advantages </H5>
  [Dhikri] In light of reports that other countries at the 
Uruguay Round of the international trade agreement failed to be 
convinced to remove their barriers to foreign financial 
services, how can Egypt benefit from joining the GATT agreement 
as regards trade in services? 
  [Shams-al-Din] In many service activities Egypt enjoys 
relative advantages that increase its competitiveness in 
particular areas. The service sector has contributed greatly and 
increasingly to national income and to improving the balance of 
payments situation, particularly through the remittances of 
overseas workers, tourism, and the Suez Canal. At the beginning 
of the nineties, the service sector contributed nearly 76 
percent to the balance of payments. Compare this to the 
situation at the beginning of the seventies, when it contributed 
only 13 percent. Thus, liberalizing international trade in 
services will realize a great export surge for Egypt. The 
service sectors rely basically on human capital and skilled 
workers in many areas. The agreement allows the service sector 
wider movement and a precise structure for exporting to foreign 
markets outside the Arab and African regions. This is of concern 
to us, according to a report of the permanent committee on trade 
in services, in such areas as professional services, work force, 
and building and construction--especially with regard to workers 
organized as groups or in exercising the right to establish 
service projects that rely on skilled workers. 
<H5>  Opportunities for Egyptian Workers </H5>
  As for the immediate advantages for Egypt, the 
liberalization 
commitments that the agreement's member nations have made will 
provide opportunities for Egyptian exports of services, 
especially in sectors that have reached a high stage of 
competitiveness, such as banking services and insurance. 
Egyptian professionals will be given an opportunity to work in 
the advanced countries. The construction sector will be able to 
carry on activity in the agreement's Arab member 
countries--Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria--as well as in the 
African countries. In addition, the services agreement allows 
Egypt through its definite commitments to obtain modern 
technology, to access communications channels and centers of 
information about service activities and trade in various 
countries, and to benefit from other countries' laws in 
regulating and encouraging its service sectors. 
  [Dhikri] Are there to be further negotiations about workers? 
  [Shams-al-Din] Regarding the Egyptian work force (the 
individuals necessary to provide services), in addition to the 
commitments that have been made in this area, negotiations will 
be held starting in May 1994 to make the advanced countries' 
markets more open to organized, rather than individual, workers. 
<H5>  Special Privileges </H5>
  [Dhikri] Egypt played a prominent role in the grouping of 
developing countries during the negotiations. What was the role 
of the Egyptian negotiator? Did the developing countries succeed 
in obtaining any advantages? Did any disagreement occur about 
liberalizing trade in services? 
  [Shams-al-Din] There was no disagreement over the principle 
of liberalizing trade in services, but there was disagreement on 
definitions. A permanent committee on the agreement has been 
formed in Egypt. It has seven subcommittees, including one on 
trade in services. The role of each committee is to participate 
with the Egyptian negotiator, so that the negotiating takes 
place on objective principles that convince the nations of the 
world that we are part of an international fabric whose goal is 
to benefit from liberalizing trade in goods and services--but 
also bears in mind the economic and social circumstances that we 
must take into account while implementing our liberalization 
program. 
  Egypt is part of the developing world. It stated its 
position 
from the beginning and played a prominent role in the grouping 
of developing countries. It acted as a spokesman for Africa and 
the Arab countries that have joined the agreement. Egypt also 
spoke in the same way as India and Latin America. Egypt was 
encouraged to play this role by its experience in its announced 
program of economic reform, which has won the esteem of advanced 
and developing countries alike. Our position was based on sound 
economic principles. Egypt officially entered the Uruguay Round 
in 1986 and announced that it was a party to the agreement. It 
participated in the 1990 multilateral negotiations. As for the 
developing countries, through their united stand in the 
negotiations they obtained special treatment in view of their 
weak competitiveness in most service sectors. The agreement on 
services included provisions that give the developing nations 
flexibility. Most importantly, they were granted a longer time 
to establish national information publishing centers to comply 
with the principle of full disclosure of local laws and 
regulations governing the service sectors under negotiation. 
Also, it was made easier for these countries to enter into 
economic integration agreements among themselves to develop 
trade in services or between themselves and the advanced 
countries, provided that the subjects of these countries are 
exempted from work and residence permits. 
  Safeguards include measures to enable a temporary 
disengagement from particular commitments in case of a balance 
of payments deficit or if the member country needs to take 
certain steps to preserve its hard currency reserve. These 
provisions allow one to request that certain commitments be 
amended or withdrawn a year after the agreement begins to be 
implemented, without being bound by the ordinarily specified 
three-year period. In addition, the developing countries, 
including Egypt, are given sufficient flexibility to subsidize 
their production or exports in the services trade. At the same 
time, the advanced countries are forbidden to use subsidies as a 
means to increase their exports to the developing countries. A 
developing country may retain a monopoly right to import certain 
of its services during the time this agreement is in effect, 
provided that the monopoly does not carry on its activity in a 
way that does not accord with the provisions of the agreement. 
There are many additional provisions that give the developing 
countries, including Egypt, greater flexibility. 
<H5>  Legislative Changes </H5>
  [Dhikri] What are Egypt's commitments under this agreement? 
Does its application require legislative or administrative 
changes? Within what time period can we accomplish what is 
required on the international level? 
  [Shams-al-Din] Egypt's general commitments accord with the 
general commitments in the agreement. Most importantly, Egypt 
commits itself to the most-favored-nation principle, under which 
any member country of the agreement will enjoy any privileges 
granted to any other member country. It also commits itself to 
the principle of full disclosure--meaning that rules governing 
trade in services are to be published, announced, and disclosed 
to others. There are particular commitments in certain sectors. 
Egypt has announced its desire to enter into the international 
services trade in economic sectors that have already been 
liberalized in the economic reform program. Lists of commitments 
have been prepared in accordance with the regulations, laws, and 
rules that govern these activities, especially in the finance 
sector, tourism, and building and construction. The Egyptian 
delegation at the negotiations demanded that other countries in 
turn promise to open their markets to Egyptian service exports, 
especially the organized and professional work force. The 
definite commitments that Egypt made will allow foreign 
investments in Egypt to set up companies in accordance with 
Egyptian legislation in the sectors of banking, insurance, 
reinsurance, capital market services, tourism services, marine 
transport services, construction services, and engineering 
consulting services. Commitments in one of these sectors were 
made before the agreement; negotiations took place and an 
agreement was reached. The remaining sectors must prepare 
themselves philosophically in the framework of this agreement. 
They must work out development programs with the assistance of 
research centers and must engage in the necessary 
training--especially in the transportation and communication 
sector, the education sector, and the social insurance sector. 
We have worked as a committee to encourage more sectors to study 
the situation and to lay down a plan to mobilize the country's 
economic and technical forces. In this way the country will be 
able to announce its full position on the general framework of 
the agreement to be signed this April. 
  As for the changes required, some pieces of legislation do 
indeed need to be changed--not to be in step with the agreement, 
but to serve the national economy. The nationalization laws have 
still not been fully repealed. We have begun the process of 
legislative change with the unified tax and the unified labor 
law. Change begins with general law and proceeds to specific 
law, specific regulation, and finally internal regulations--all 
for a single purpose more important than any other purpose, 
namely economic reform.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mahir Mahran, population and family </F>
affairs minister, by Suhayr al-Husayni; place and date not 
given--first five paragraphs are AKHIR SA'AH introduction] 
  [Text] What comes next now that the population clock has 
sprung on us the surprise that Egypt's population has reached 
60.283 million people, compared to 58 million last year? What 
about the population minister's statements that we have been 
able to control the population explosion and that there is 
evident response from citizens to family planning? Will our 
media continue to confront this population catastrophe with 
television and newspaper advertisements? Can this dangerous 
figure motivate the government to adopt firm decisions to deal 
with this problem that has become a matter of life or death for 
Egypt's future development? When will family planning become a 
national issue, and when will all factions be called upon to 
contribute to solving it? 
  Numerous questions and inquiries that abound with anxiety 
and 
that are reiterated on the Egyptian scene gathered in my mind 
while I was on my way to interview Dr. Mahir Mahran, the 
population and family affairs minister, who said promptly, "The 
declared figure is incorrect and it doesn't reflect the true 
number of Egypt's population. There is an actual response to 
family planning and the number of women using contraceptives has 
amounted to 50 percent." The minister added, "We cannot do more 
than this or issue firm decisions similar to those issued by 
China because of our social circumstances. Therefore, we rely on 
persuasion and leave the choice up to the citizens." 
  It was natural for me to begin the dialogue with Dr. Mahir 
Mahran, the population and family affairs minister, by asking 
him for an explanation on the report circulated by all the 
media, saying that the population of the Arab Republic of Egypt 
has amounted to 60.283 million people, compared to 58 million 
last year. 
  Explaining, Dr. Mahir Mahran responded, "This figure is 
incorrect because it doesn't reflect the true number of the 
population of the Arab Republic of Egypt. When we speak of 
Egypt's population, we shouldn't include citizens who reside in 
Libya and Kuwait and emigrants to Canada and Australia because 
we aren't responsible for educating, feeding, or treating them. 
So, the actual number of Egypt's population is 57.673 million 
people. This is the number with which government officials deal 
when they consider the provision of housing, food, schools, and 
hospitals. This certainly isn't in conflict with our moral 
responsibility for expatriate Egyptians." 
  The population affairs minister added, "The danger of the 
population problem lies in the fact that there is disparity 
between population growth and available resources. Expatriate 
Egyptians aren't included in these calculations." 
<H5>  We Have Exceeded Targeted Figure </H5>
  [al-Husayni] Far from the census figures and from how 
correct 
they are, you have announced that the population explosion 
process has been brought under control and that the citizens 
have responded to family planning. If this has actually 
happened, then why haven't its effects shown clearly in the 
population surveys? 
  [Mahran] What I have announced is completely true. The proof 
is that the normal population growth rate was 30 per 1,000 or 3 
percent. This rate dropped to 22 per 1,000 or 2.2 percent in 
1992. Moreover, we have recently received indications confirming 
that normal population growth has dropped to less than 20 per 
1,000 or 2 percent. This is undoubtedly great, especially if we 
consider the recommendations of the national population 
conference that was attended by President Husni Mubarak in 1984. 
If we review those resolutions, we find that they hoped that 
contraceptive use among women would amount to 36 percent by 1991 
and to 43 percent by 1996. But what has happened, and this is 
confirmed by statistics, is that contraception use among women 
of child-bearing age amounted to 47.6 percent, or close to 48 
percent, in 1990. This means that in 1990, we were able to 
surpass the figure targeted for 1996. This percentage is 
significant because it undoubtedly reflects on the number of 
births. Consequently, statistics indicate that from 1991 to 
1992, the number of births dropped by 100,000. 
  [al-Husayni] Mr. minister, this 100,000 figure is very small 
and it doesn't signify the evident response about which you have 
talked. 
  [Mahran] When dealing with this issue, we must take into 
account that Egypt's illiteracy rate amounts to 46 percent now, 
as shown by the population plan prepared under the supervision 
of 80 experts and professors representing the ministries 
concerned, universities, research centers, and private 
organizations. Despite this high illiteracy rate, we find that 
there is response among women of child-bearing age to the use of 
contraceptives, especially in Upper Egypt. The proof of this is 
that the population and health survey, conducted every four 
years, has confirmed that in some governorates, especially in 
Upper Egypt, contraceptive use among women increased by 100 
percent from 1988 to 1992. 
  [al-Husayni] But statistics also confirm that Egypt's 
population has been increasing by 1.2 million annually for 
several years. So, why doesn't the effect of increased 
contraceptive use show in population figures? 
  [Mahran] Population growth is a must. It exists and it will 
continue to exist for the next 20-25 years because Egypt has now 
a broad segment, amounting to nearly 45 percent the population, 
aged below 20. This segment will have its turn to marry and to 
think of family and of producing children. This is normal and 
expected. 
<H5>  Continued Increase </H5>
  [al-Husayni] This is a foregone conclusion. But in light of 
the efforts you have talked about, it is possible to reduce the 
increase to just 1 million instead of 1.2 million? 
  [Mahran] This is actually what has been happening. 
Population 
growth rose to 1.4 million annually and then dropped to 1.2 
million. We should note that even though Egypt's population is 
growing steadily, we have maintained this rate [of 1.2 million] 
for several years. This is a good sign. If the response I am 
talking about wasn't there, this [1.2 million] figure would have 
increased year after year. 
<H5>  Television Advertisements Aren't Enough </H5>
  [al-Husayni] Mr. Minister, many believe that at a national 
population center and then at the population affairs ministry, 
you have relied fundamentally for family planning on television 
and newspaper advertising. You spend on this advertising 
millions of pounds that you get either from foreign 
organizations or from the state budget. But this isn't enough to 
confront Egypt's population growth problem now that it has 
become so serious. 
  [Mahran] To begin, the phase of strong emphasis on the media 
has been essential for enlightenment. If you are talking about 
the futility of television advertising campaigns for the 
educated, then this is true. But the educated account for no 
more than 20 percent of the Egyptian people and most of them do 
their own family planning without the need for any other party. 
But the rest of the Egyptian people, especially the Egyptian 
rural population and those who live in poor quarters and who 
constitute the overwhelming majority of Egypt's population--they 
are greatly influenced by television and it has produced obvious 
results among them. For example, television has disseminated 
information beneficial to the service recipients, whether the 
information is about finding the places where the service is 
rendered or about various types of contraception and about how 
to get them. This has led to an increased number of women who 
frequent family planning clinics. Therefore, the means of 
television advertising is, within the bounds of our resources 
and circumstances, an effective means, especially since we are 
talking about a country where the illiteracy rate amounts to 46 
percent. 
<H5>  China's Experiment </H5>
  [al-Husayni] Other countries, such as China, have employed 
swift means to solve this problem by issuing firm requirements 
that citizens observe and apply or else be exposed to negative 
incentives. Consequently, these countries have been actually 
able to deal with this problem within a few years. 
  [Mahran] The Egyptian citizen will not accept the means used 
by China, especially since China has employed just two specific 
means, namely compulsory abortion and sterilization. These means 
are prohibited by law, except in a few cases, such as when the 
mother's health is in danger. Moreover, China has determined 
that urban families will have one child and rural families two. 
If a citizen fails to observe this limitation, he is subjected 
to negative incentives. But we cannot employ this method in 
Egypt. The citizen will reject it and some clergymen will object 
to it. Moreover, Egypt's leaders believe that it isn't 
appropriate to force citizens to implement something through 
pressure and punishment, especially under the difficult economic 
circumstances that Egypt is experiencing currently and that 
cause hardship to many citizens. 
  [al-Husayni] Mr. Minister, the direct cause of the economic 
and social crisis experienced currently by Egypt is the fearful 
annual population growth. If the problem of population inflation 
isn't dealt with, pressures and hardship will increase year 
after year. 
  [Mahran] This is true. But even if the government agrees to 
establish family planning controls and to compel citizens to 
apply them, we will be surprised by a revolution by clergymen, 
perhaps even before citizens object. We will begin hearing 
phrases such as, "each infant comes with his livelihood" and 
"you are interfering in God's will." Therefore, the means we 
have used so far is the means of persuading people of voluntary 
family planning with gentle words and without the use of 
coercion or pressure. 
  [al-Husayni] Will you continue to use gentle and voluntary 
means even if they fail to produce the desired results, thus 
making the population problem more serious and complex? 
  [Mahran] We are proceeding along the right path, but not 
with 
the required speed. This saddles the government with some 
economic burdens. However, the government accepts this burden so 
the citizens will not experience more pressures. We don't wish 
to speak pessimistically about this issue, especially since 
there is response to family planning, even though it isn't as 
quick as one desires. But it suffices that we have gotten to the 
point where one of every two women uses contraceptives. 
<H5>  National Issue </H5>
  [al-Husayni] Mr. Minister, many demand that we establish the 
population growth issue as a national issue to which all 
factions contribute their ideas and efforts, especially since 
this issue has become a matter of life or death to Egypt's 
future development. 
  [Mahran] Everybody will participate and cooperate with us 
when he is convinced of the need for family planning. This is 
what we are trying to accomplish now as a first step. 
  [al-Husayni] To deal with this problem, we can make our 
national issue for the coming phase the issue of applying the 
law that prohibits truancy at the basic education level and that 
calls for punishing truant children. I believe that applying 
this law is enough to deal with a major part of the problem. 
  [Mahran] How? 
  [al-Husayni] Most urban families are content with one or two 
children because to these families, a child is a financial 
burden when it comes to schooling, food, and clothing. But most 
families who produce a large number of children view a child as 
a source of income, considering that such a child leaves school, 
goes into the labor market, and starts earning a monthly income 
of 100 pounds or more while still in his tender years. This is 
why a child is a source of wealth for such families and why they 
cannot respond to or be persuaded by the principle of family 
planning, which will deprive them of this income. This is the 
class of people who produce 10 or more children and who create 
the population crisis we are all experiencing now. Therefore, if 
the law prohibiting school truancy is applied, if a fine is 
levied on a truant child, and if the family begins to shoulder 
the expenses of feeding, clothing, and educating the child, it 
will think a thousand times before it produces this immense 
number of children. 
  [Mahran] We have no objection to adopting any measure as 
long 
as it is in society's interest. But this must be done in light 
of conclusions reached by studies on this issue. 
  However, we are currently conducting field studies in 
cooperation with Egyptian research centers. We await the outcome 
of these studies on the rural family's size, on labor among 
children, and on school truancy numbers. We can then make the 
right decision on this issue in light of the conclusions made by 
these studies. 
<H5>  Lowered Service Standard </H5>
  [al-Husayni] So, in addition to advertising in the various 
media, what is the ministry's plan to tackle this problem in the 
coming phase, especially since one of the important reasons for 
creating this ministry is to confront Egypt's population growth 
problem? 
  [Mahran] To start, barely three months have passed since the 
ministry was created. Moreover, we are dealing with all elements 
of the population issue, not just with family planning. There is 
no doubt that family planning is an important element on which 
we focus in our effort to solve the population growth problem. 
But the population problem has three main dimensions: 

  -  The first dimension is increased population growth. We try 
to curtail this problem through family planning activities 
designed to curb the rush to produce children. 
  -  The second dimension is the poor distribution of Egypt's 
population. For example, 99 percent of the population lives on a 
narrow strip along the Nile. If we redistribute the population, 
we will eliminate numerous problems. We will reduce population 
density, haphazard housing, terrorism, and crimes. We have 
actually begun to work to achieve this end. If we look at 
Egypt's map, we will find that efforts have been made by the 
government to redistribute the population. For example, numerous 
new towns and villages have been built in the Red Sea 
Governorate and citizens have begun to move there, inhabit, and 
develop them. Moreover, a number of villages have appeared along 
the northern coastal highway all the way to Marsa Matruh 
Governorate. This is in addition to new towns in Upper Egypt 
where we find, for example, al-Minya and al-Minya al-Jadidah 
[New al-Minya], Asyut and Asyut al-Jadidah, plus the towns 
created in recent years, such as al-'Ubur, al-Sadat, 10 Ramadan, 
6 October, and other towns. All these towns have been built to 
redistribute the population. But to accomplish this goal, 
greater awareness is needed among the population so people will 
move and reside in these new towns, especially if work 
opportunities and housing and residential resources are secured 
for them. 
  -  The third dimension is the so-called low standard of 
services. 
Here, it is required to enhance the standard of services 
provided to the population. What I mean is that in the area of 
education, the number of the educated should be increased. In 
the area of health, mortality rates among infants and pregnant 
mothers should be reduced. For example, the mortality rate among 
pregnant women is 174 per 100,000. This is a very high rate when 
compared with the advanced countries, where the mortality rate 
among pregnant women is 5-11 per 100,000 pregnancies. The more 
we enhance the population characteristics, the greater 
population awareness grows. Thus, we can develop the idea of 
what the appropriate family size is, making this size compatible 
with the family's material and social capabilities, which is 
what is happening in the West. 
  The family planning services plan of the Ministry of 
Population and Family Affairs focuses on spreading health 
services to villages, especially since one-half Egypt's 
villages, totaling 4,200 in number, are deprived of family 
planning services. The plan also focuses on greater use of the 
media in all its forms; on manufacturing contraceptives locally 
under all circumstances, regardless of the nature of our 
relations with the countries from which we acquire these 
contraceptives; and on providing the service permanently. The 
plan calls, moreover, for securing a rural female advisor for 
every 5,000 families. Currently, one advisor is allocated for 
every 30,000 families. Consequently, she cannot perform her 
duties at all. The plans also calls that greater attention be 
given to the issue by local governments and that family planning 
committees be formed that are headed by village chiefs. This is 
what we have actually begun to do in a number of villages, 
especially since a village chief has strong relations with his 
village inhabitants ordinarily and since he can influence and 
persuade them. The plan further calls for increasing the number 
of mobile medical units, especially since there are villages 
that are so remote from family planning centers and units that 
the clinics and units cannot provide the required services to 
the inhabitants of these villages.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Aql: "In Order To Absorb </F>
Unemployment"] 
  [Text] The Alexandria Businessmen's Association's 
experiment of espousing a small industries policy as a means to 
absorb unemployment and help develop the Egyptian economy has 
proved a great success, now that the problems of funding this 
large project have been overcome. Grants by the American AID 
[Agency for International Development] organization have also 
helped. Such projects have proved to be successful in all parts 
of the world when supervised by community institutions such as 
businessmen's associations. As we have said before, the 
Alexandria Businessmen's Association's project has made it 
possible to provide 20,000 jobs. 
  The association's sense of the dimensions of the 
unemployment 
problem is leading it to make an effort to carry such a project 
to all the governorates of Egypt. 
  Furthermore, AID has decided to implement five similar 
projects in five governorates. The Alexandria Businessmen's 
Association has volunteered to make every effort to provide the 
necessary training and bring its experience to the governorates 
in which the new projects will be implemented. Training has 
already begun. 
  Transferring this expertise is necessary for all the 
associations that are going to take charge of these 
projects--especially for the leaders and cadres working in such 
a project. 
  Transferring the systems followed in accounts, information 
extraction, monitoring by highly developed computer programs, 
and training on the record-keeping cycle of all operations, as 
well as management systems, incentive systems, legal systems and 
compensations for workers, surely will save much time and 
effort. It will enable the new projects to achieve positive 
results in the shortest possible time. This will make us very 
happy in Alexandria because of our sense of having given 
something to the country. 
  Perhaps private, nongovernmental associations will begin to 
implement such a project in all governorates of Egypt. We know 
that AID has a great desire to establish and fund such important 
projects as soon as an organized group of businessmen exists 
eager to serve its country and ready to shoulder this 
responsibility in one of the governorates. 
  The Alexandria Businessmen's Association currently manages a 
project funded at 39 million pounds by the Social Fund in 
cooperation with Bank Misr. The project's goal is to establish 
new enterprises for graduates of universities and technical 
institutes and schools. 
  Many young people frequently ask about the terms for 
obtaining these loans. 
  The terms, briefly stated, involve presenting a good study 
that explains how the enterprise can succeed and the existence 
of a place where it can be implemented. 
  The association has already begun implementing the project. 
Four months ago, some 3,000 young people submitted studies in 
which they applied for loans to begin new businesses. About 
2,500 applications were rejected due to lack of places for the 
young people to set up their desired enterprises. The rest of 
the applications are proceeding well. The association, in 
cooperation with Bank Misr, is allocating about 1 million pounds 
a month in loans to young people who fulfill the terms in many 
areas of industry, agriculture, livestock fattening, and 
services. 
  Those responsible for the project at the Alexandria 
Businessmen's Association are determining by experience the 
problems that small industries confront in development. The 
association has a number of observations about these problems. 
The most important of them are: 
  1. We all know that the bulk of the unemployed are 
concentrated in old cities and zones of haphazard development. 
Because these small industries depend for their marketing on 
members of the community, they cannot survive if they are moved 
outside the community. 
  Decisions now being implemented aim at moving all industries 
away from the cities in order to improve environmental 
conditions. This is being done at a time when alternative 
locations have not been prepared near the communities, so that 
the industries can expand in them without restrictions. These 
decisions prevent any small enterprise from making any change in 
the place it uses or rearranging it so that it can expand. Thus, 
they aim at combatting expansion, while Egypt's welfare demands 
that these enterprises develop and expand. 
  Also, these decisions provide a golden opportunity for the 
bureaucrats charged with overseeing them to control these 
industries and thus create an unstable condition for them. 
  We all know that on New York's Seventh Avenue there are tall 
buildings completely filled with small factories that produce 
everything imaginable. We see the same story in Hong Kong and 
Taiwan. In many countries there are hundreds of large buildings 
containing factories of all specialties located inside the 
cities and on all streets. 
  We must also remember that the electric motors that run 
these 
industries have developed so that they no longer produce any 
noise. The laws allow the installation of air conditioners 
everywhere. They are run by electric motors whose horsepower 
often is much greater than what some handicraft industries use. 
  Certainly, the unemployment problem is so serious that it 
must take priority over the environment problem, especially in 
the conditions that the country is currently experiencing. 
  Implementing such decisions in the old cities not only 
hinders the development of small industries, it prevents the 
possible establishment of new industries. Studies estimate that 
at least 50,000 new enterprises could start every year in these 
communities. Currently they cannot be established, and their 
[potential] owners become not only a force that is unemployed 
but one that is destructive to society. 
  We hope that all the decisions will be changed so that they 
promote the expansion of small industries or the establishment 
of new enterprises in the old cities, as long as they do not 
emit noise, gases, fumes, or odors that harm the environment. 
Other than this, it is not right to place any restrictions. 
  The pioneering productive families project that the Ministry 
of Social Affairs is sponsoring under the leadership of its 
minister, Dr. Amal 'Uthman, depends on employing these families 
in productive activities inside the residence where they live, 
thereby transforming the families into a self-supporting 
productive force that can contribute to economic development. It 
is not right for decisions to be implemented that go counter to 
this national strategy. 
  2. Encouraging the establishment of light, labor-intensive, 
nonpolluting industries is one of the most important ways of 
dealing with the unemployment problem in Egypt. We all know that 
high wages for workers in the advanced countries are causing 
such industries to be closed in those countries and move to 
countries that enjoy cheap labor. Egypt can benefit greatly from 
putting millions of workers to work in these industries. The 
most important of them are the ready-made clothing industry, 
handmade carpets, electronics, and assembling industries. Any 
ready-made clothing or electronics factory can easily absorb a 
thousand workers. 
  These industries do not lend themselves to establishment in 
new communities because the operation of transporting thousands 
of workers daily from the old cities where there is an 
accumulated work force to the new cities is a very costly 
operation that tires the workers and affects their productivity. 
Such enterprises must be established in old cities, villages, 
and zones of haphazard development, so as to turn unemployed 
workers in those areas into a healthy, productive force. 
Unfortunately, this principle conflicts with the decisions now 
being implemented. Such industries therefore are not spreading 
or expanding to absorb thousands of workers because the 
operation of transporting workers every day increases the 
industry's cost and reduces the workers' productivity. 
Furthermore, these industries need to enjoy the same years of 
tax exemption set in the new communities. We hope this problem 
will be studied seriously. We ask officials to visit the 
clothing factory in al-Badrashayn. It employs 3,000 workers, and 
all of its production is earmarked for export to the United 
States. It is an example of what we are talking about. 
  3. When it issued the recent unified tax law, the government 
paid attention to giving a five-year tax exemption to new 
enterprises funded by the Social Fund. 
  In the People's Assembly committee that held hearings on the 
aforementioned law, the Alexandria Businessmen's Association 
proposed that the same exemption be applied to the loans that 
any registered nonprofit association grants to combat 
unemployment, just as is done with the Social Fund. We hope that 
this view will be followed in the future. 
  These are some observations that will help with formulating 
the necessary plans to deal with the problem of unemployment.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Shaykh Ahmad Bin-Farid </F>
al-Suraymah, leader of Shabwah Tribal Grouping in 'Ataq, by 
'Abdallah Hammudah in London; date not given: "Ahmad Bin-Farid 
Supports Local Authorities, Yemeni Unity; Accuses Governor, 
Police Chief of Using Their Positions To Entrench 
Partisanship"--first four paragraphs are AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
introduction] 
  [Text] Now that Yemen's map of political forces has changed 
after unification and the adoption of a multiparty system, 
certain Yemeni figures have returned after years outside their 
country, to participate in building the new state, starting from 
the positions they left when they departed during the years 
following South Yemen's independence on 30 November 1967. 
  Among the major post-unification returnees who has recently 
played an important role is Shaykh Ahmad Bin-Farid al-Suraymah, 
leader of the Tribal Grouping, which currently backs the 
Socialist Party in Shabwah governorate. Considered one of the 
most powerful figures there, he was a figure in the episodes of 
confrontation that took place in the region during the past two 
weeks. 
  Against charges of "regionalism" and "traditionalism" that 
some have leveled against tribal figures in the governorates, 
Shaykh Bin-Farid declares that he supports the local authorities 
in their support of the unified state. However, he rejects the 
use of the organs of that state for narrow partisan purposes. He 
is placing his resources as a businessman in the Arab and 
international arena at the service of the people of Shabwah in 
the context of a new alliance with the Socialist Party that will 
restore rights to their true holders and release their energies 
to participate in public work. 
  Shaykh Bin-Farid spoke for the first time to the Arabic 
press--AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT--by telephone between 'Ataq, the 
capital of Shabwah governorate, and London. The following 
conversation took place. 
  [Hammudah] What is the real situation now in Shabwah as you 
see it? 
  [Bin-Farid] The situation in Shabwah now is that the great 
majority of citizens, tribal and nontribal, support the 
Socialist Party--in other words, the local authority that is an 
accomplished fact. 
  Certain episodes have taken place in the area, as you have 
heard. This was because of provocative elements of the [General] 
People's Congress. Foremost among them were Ahmad Musa'id 
Husayn, the former governor of Shabwah in 1972 and also the 
former minister of state security, and a group from Shalal 
province who entered an area on the edges of Shabwah. There were 
also attempts to smuggle in arms and explosives in Mercedes 
trucks belonging to Colonel Ahmad 'Ali Muhsin, the Shabwah 
police commander. But elements from the Tribal Grouping, which 
backs the local government--the Socialist Party--in Shabwah, 
confronted them and stopped them. 
  This flows from our faith and agrees with the Pledge and 
Accord Document, which provided for the principle of 
decentralization and established the foundations of local 
government. We are on the way to implementing it in fact. 
  In my opinion, as long as the political leaders in Aden and 
Sanaa have been unable to implement the local government 
provided by the charter, it is reasonable and practical for us 
to begin implementing it on the scene. We are not against 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih as a person or the People's Congress as a party; 
we are for the Charter of Treaty and Agreement. It must be 
translated into action. 
  That is why this Tribal Grouping, which includes 90 percent 
of the people of Shabwah governorate, came into existence. 
  The situation two months ago was that people in Shabwah were 
suffering from confusion and vacillation, unable to distinguish 
between true and false. So we explained these matters to them. 
They understood them, and we gained control. Conditions 
stabilized completely, except when elements intent on sabotage 
occasionally tried to smuggle arms and explosives into Shabwah. 
I regret to say that they were coming from Sanaa. 
  Now, however, we have set up tribal check points in Wadi 
Markhah under the al-Nisiyin tribes, in Wadi Khawrah under the 
leadership of the Al Dayyan tribes, and in Wadi Hammam under the 
control of the Hammam tribes. We have also managed almost to 
cordon off the roads into 'Ataq under the leadership of Shaykh 
'Awad Husayn 'Ashim al-Kawkabi. He is certainly the number-two 
figure in the Tribal Grouping and one of Shabwah's most 
important shaykhs. 
<H5>  Events in 'Ataq </H5>
  [Hammudah] What exactly happened in 'Ataq? Did you besiege 
the headquarters of the governorate and the police 
administration? 
  [Bin-Farid] That is correct--when we arrived. The reason was 
because Governor Dirhim Nu'man and Police Commandant Ahmad 'Ali 
Muhsin turned these offices, which are official offices that 
represent the state as a whole, into headquarters for organizing 
the People's Congress, inciting the people against the Socialist 
Party, and entrenching the Congress's control. 
  We said to them: "You represent a state, not the People's 
Congress or the Socialist Party. The governor represents the 
authority of the state, and the police director performs the 
duty of a man in government service." We insisted that they 
clear the buildings of the armed elements that were intimidating 
citizens into joining the People's Congress by force. This is 
the reason. 
  [Hammudah] But they say that they are the last symbols of 
the 
People's Congress in the southern and eastern governorates and 
that their expulsion could somehow be considered as putting an 
end to unity and entrenching secession. How do you reply to this? 
  [Bin-Farid] We say that the presence of the two ought to 
represent the united state, not the People's Congress. 
  [Hammudah] You seem to be working on the assumption that you 
have no objection to their remaining if they represent the 
united state, and not a particular party. 
  [Bin-Farid] Yes, exactly. 
  [Hammudah] They still have not left the two buildings. Does 
that mean that they have carried out what you asked them to do? 
  [Bin-Farid] They appear to have carried it out temporarily, 
because the joint military committee has arrived. But I suspect 
that when the committee leaves, they will return to their 
activities as before. 
<H5>  Persona Non Grata </H5>
  [Hammudah] What danger did the return of Ahmad Musa'id 
Husayn 
represent? 
  [Bin-Farid] He really is persona non grata. In his personal 
and tribal capacity he represents no danger at all to the 
Shabwah area, because he belongs to the Jabwan [as 
transliterated] tribe, one of the smallest tribes of al-'Awaliq, 
representing perhaps no more than 3 percent of the total 
tribespeople of Shabwah. 
  However, he does represent a danger because he claims to 
represent the People's Congress and claims that he has been sent 
officially by them. Indeed, he brought about 20 armed crews with 
him, armed with such weapons as the Dushka. That is the source 
of the danger. But when we arrived, his influence and moves 
shrank to the valley to which he belongs, a small valley no more 
than 10 square kilometers in area. He has not left it from the 
time we arrived until the present moment. 
  [Hammudah] Is he besieged in this area? 
  [Bin-Farid] He is not besieged, but he is forbidden from all 
the tribes surrounding him. One can therefore say that he is 
besieged according to tribal customs--in the sense that the 
tribes are boycotting him. 
  [Hammudah] What is the nature of the relationship between 
you 
and Colonel 'Awad al-Safidi, commander of the central military 
axis of the Socialist Party's southern forces? General People's 
Congress communiques say that he backed you with armored 
vehicles and forces in the operation of encircling governorate 
and police headquarters. 
  [Bin-Farid] That is absolutely untrue. We did not see him 
all 
that week, which indicates that there is no connection between 
us. 
<H5>  Change of Positions </H5>
  [Hammudah] Some people, attempting to review the pages of 
history, say that you were a foe of the Socialist Party in the 
past, but that now you support it. How would you reply to them? 
  [Bin-Farid] This is a true charge in its place. I indeed was 
a foe of the Socialist Party, or what used to be called the 
National Front, after my house was demolished and I was evicted 
from it in November 1967. We have continued to disagree with 
them in opinion and principle throughout the past 25 years. We 
indeed have fought them. However, the balances have changed, as 
we now know. We are sure that they have abandoned their old 
methods and ideas. 
  [Hammudah] Is that why you think that joint action with them 
has now become acceptable? 
  [Bin-Farid] Yes. Yes, because participation and dialogue are 
necessary in order to implement democracy somehow. I believe 
they have good intentions. Time will tell. We hope that what we 
have in mind is correct. 
  [Hammudah] How do you assess the strength of the General 
People's Congress and the Yemeni Grouping for Reform in Shabwah 
governorate? 
  [Bin-Farid] The fact is that the People's Congress and the 
Reform Grouping were rejected by many groups from various 
classes of the people. 
  The two of them have spent tremendous sums--money, weapons, 
and vehicles. This is a pity, because general elections were 
held on 27 April last year and expressed the will of the people 
of each governorate. The people of Shabwah governorate elected 
the Socialist Party's candidate from among the other candidates. 
This is democracy. 
  The Congress and Reform ought to have stepped in again only 
when it came time for the next elections. That is when they 
should have made their contribution. But they have tried to 
impose their presence by force of arms, which is a mistake. 
  [Hammudah] People are saying that the People's Congress and 
the Reform Grouping are trying to develop their own local forces 
in Shabwah and that at the same time the Socialist Party has 
turned to you. Is that correct? 
  [Bin-Farid] It is not correct. We came to Shabwah as 
ordinary 
citizens, to visit family and kin, to rebuild our demolished 
homes, and to begin implementing the building and settlement 
projects we had promised. We in fact began to repair schools and 
hospitals. A week ago we began constructing a 35-kilometer road 
between 'Ataq and al-Musayni'ah at my personal expense. This 
shows that we love peace. We do not advocate fighting, and we do 
not carry weapons unless we are forced to do so. 
  [Hammudah] Since the events of January 1986, Shabwah and 
Abyan governorates have been a virtual silent opposition to the 
Socialist Party. The People's Congress is said to have tried to 
benefit from this in order to detach al-Mahrah and Hadramawt 
governorates in the east from Aden and Lahij governorates in the 
west. [sentence as published] Is this correct? 
  [Bin-Farid] Yes, this is indeed the strategy of the People's 
Congress. The implementation plan for it included pushing seven 
brigades from Ma'rib to split Shabwah to the sea by way of 
Mayfa'ah and Bi'r 'Ali. Thus they would gain control of Shabwah 
and detach Hadramawt and al-Mahrah, where the oil fields are 
located. However, when the 30th Brigade reached Shabwah early in 
January, we also arrived, completely thwarting this strategy. 
The balance has shifted. However, that is what they might have 
done. 
  In my opinion, that strategy has failed, and they no longer 
have any hope of accomplishing it. 
<H5>  Conditional Support </H5>
  [Hammudah] To what extent do you think the tribes of Shabwah 
support the Socialist Party? 
  [Bin-Farid] The fact, as you know, is that if the Socialist 
Party proves its good intentions and translates them into 
deeds--and we have proposed to them that they restore private 
property to its owners, resume respecting tribal figures, and 
turn over sensitive positions to the people of Shabwah in 
managing their affairs, not making the holding of these 
positions conditional on being Socialist Party members, but 
giving them to generous, sincere, and honest persons, regardless 
of their previous political affiliations--I think that if they 
act in accordance with this view and continue in it, success 
will be theirs, and the majority will be on their side. 
  [Hammudah] Does that mean that talk about how the tribes in 
Shabwah are submissive to the Socialist Party is a mistaken 
assertion? 
  [Bin-Farid] Yes. 
  [Hammudah] Tension has largely returned in recent days. What 
are the facts about this? 
  [Bin-Farid] No, it has not returned. Nothing new has 
happened 
since the incident that took place in Bayhan. 
  [Hammudah] What happened there? 
  [Bin-Farid] About 10 large Mercedes trucks came loaded with 
food for the military economic installation in 'Ataq. They tried 
to bring them in by force, without submitting them to inspection 
by one of the army posts in al-Sulaym district. A group of 
tribesmen affiliated with the People's Congress, led by 'Ali 
Bin-Rashid al-Harithi, then attacked. A clash took place. Five 
members of the army were killed, and three of the Ba al-Harith. 
The trucks were seized and brought to 'Ataq. They are now 
undergoing inspection, because weapons are suspected to be among 
the sacks of rice and flour. 
  [Hammudah] Are you in daily contact with the governor and 
police chief? 
  [Bin-Farid] Yes, we are in contact--not daily, but every few 
days. We are not hostile to them personally, but we are hostile 
to the style they are following. 
  [Hammudah] Do you think there has been an improvement in 
their style, so that it has become more acceptable to the people? 
  [Bin-Farid] As I said previously, while the military 
committee is present, the two of them are implementing certain 
demands about not gathering together certain elements that 
support them in the People's Congress. However, I fear they may 
return to the old way of doing things after the committee 
leaves--and if they go back, we will too!

  [Text] Moscow, March 7 (UNI). Russia will help India 
modernise T-72 tanks and other Soviet-designed weapons, 
according to commander-in-chief of the Russian land forces 
Col.-Gen. Vladimir Semyonov, reports ITAR-TASS. 
  He announced this after the final round of talks with Indian 
army chief Gen. B.C. Joshi yesterday. Gen. Joshi left for home 
this morning after a nine-week official visit to the country. 
  The Russian general also did not rule out leasing some types 
of weapons for two or three years to India, he however, did not 
elaborate. 
  Observers recall that India had taken a nuclear powered, 
submarine from Russia on lease in the eighties. 
  While talking to ITAR-TASS, Gen. Joshi expressed India's 
willingness to continue military-technical cooperation with 
Russia and said 70 percent of arms with the Indian army were 
Soviet-designed. He also talked of India's problems in getting 
the spares. 
  According to the Russian media, Gen. Joshi had shown 
interest 
in purchasing the latest T-72 C tanks, self-propelled artillery 
guns and military aircraft. However, the Indian embassy here 
denied the report saying such negotiations are conducted at a 
much lower bureaucratic level.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 3 (PTI). India and Poland today 
pledged to take innovative measures to promote joint ventures, 
trade and economic cooperation which had fallen to a rate not in 
keeping with their potential and interests. 
  Speaking at a banquet in honour of the Polish President, Mr. 
Lech Walesa, the President, Dr. S.D. Sharma, said the changes 
that had taken place in both the countries called for fresh 
approaches to enhance economic and industrial cooperation. 
  Dr. Sharma said the dramatic developments that occurred in 
Poland over the last decade had been an important catalyst in 
ending the cold war and fundamentally transforming international 
relations. 
  Mr. Walesa, in his reply, praised India's efforts to stop 
the 
arms race and eliminate the threat of a nuclear war. 
  India, often together with Poland, had always been in those 
places where conflicts had to be settled, he said citing the 
Indo-China commissions and more recently in peace-keeping 
operations in West Asia and Cambodia. 
  Turning to the economic front, Mr. Walesa said he believed 
that there were right conditions to expand bilateral economic 
co-operations and promote joint ventures. 
  Dr. Sharma noted that the courageous resistance of the 
Polish 
people evoked admiration in India when the dark forces had 
engulfed Poland. 
  The dramatic developments that occurred in Poland and the 
Polish society over the last decade have been an important 
catalyst in changing not only the face of Europe but in ending 
the cold war and thus, fundamentally transforming international 
relations, he added. 
  Mr. Walesa said Poland always attached a great deal of 
importance to its contacts and cooperation with India and also a 
particular respect for its foreign policy. 
  "India has continuously made efforts to bridge the gaps 
separating the world," he said. 
  Mr. Walesa said his country is involved in the process of 
having a market-based economy and sought Indian participation in 
it through cooperation in various industrial and technological 
fields. 
  Dr. Sharma said India will be happy to cooperate with Poland 
in a manner mutually beneficial to both countries.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 3. The Polish Foreign Minister, Mr. 
Andrzej Olechowski, conveyed during his meeting with the 
Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Dinesh Singh, that the 
Pakistani resolution at the United Nations Human Rights 
Commission, now in session in Geneva, "did not enjoy his 
government's support." 
  Mr. Olechowski further said that Poland attached great 
emphasis on its relations with India in the context of India's 
international position and status. 
  The two Foreign Ministers discussed the ongoing reforms in 
the UN system where Mr. Dinesh Singh emphasised the need for 
strengthening the UN through greater democratisation and 
economic cooperation among member nations. 
  Mr. Dinesh Singh briefed his Polish counterpart on 
Pakistan's 
attempts to internationalise the Kashmir issue in the guise of 
human rights. In this context Mr. Dinesh Singh referred to 
Pakistan's own "abysmal" human rights record. He further pointed 
out that the political process in that State could easily begin 
if Pakistan stopped abetting terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. 
  India and Poland called for "fresh and innovative 
approaches" 
to develop strong and multi-dimensional cooperation in various 
area, particularly the economic and industrial sectors and in 
setting up joint ventures in science and technology and 
agriculture fields. 
  "There are conducive conditions, to expand cooperation in 
promoting joint economic ventures in a wide range of areas from 
mining and industrial machinery to chemical and metal products," 
the President, Mr. S.D. Sharma said at a banquet hosted by him 
in honour of the visiting Polish President, Mr. Lech Walesa here 
on Thursday night. 
  Dr. Sharma said the changes which have taken place in both 
countries needed fresh approach and it was gratifying to note 
that the Joint Business Council was bringing the entrepreneurs 
of "our countries together." Mr. Walesa, who was accorded a 
ceremonial welcome in the morning, on his arrival on a six-day 
State visit held talks with the President on various bilateral 
matters and issue of mutual interest. 
  Mr. Walesa said his country attached great importance to his 
talks with the Indian leaders as the world was looking for new 
solutions following the dismemberment of the Soviet Union. 
  Dr. Sharma said the dramatic developments that had occurred 
in Poland in the last decade were an important catalyst in 
changing not only the face of Europe, but in ending the cold war 
and thus, transforming international relations. 
  He also lauded Mr. Walesa's contribution in the Polish 
revolution. 
  The President said that India was fully committed to the 
democratic way of life. "It is only natural that the 
extraordinary changes which have taken place in Poland should 
strengthen and add new bonds of friendship between our two 
countries based on shared values and beliefs," he said. 
  "We look forward to the further development of friendly and 
mutually beneficial cooperation in the varied spheres of our 
interaction," Dr. Sharma further added. 
  He hoped that Mr. Walesa's visit would give fresh impetus to 
the close and abiding ties between India and Poland. 
  He said India greatly admired the Polish contribution to 
human knowledge and achievements." We also value greatly the 
tradition of Indological studies in Poland," he said. [sentence 
as published] 
  Mr. Walesa in his speech said that Poland attached great 
importance to its contacts and cooperation with India. 
  "Our cooperation will bring benefit to our people and will 
strengthen the implementation of the economic reforms in both 
countries."

  [Text] New Delhi, March 4. Indian and Polish leaders today 
held wide-ranging political discussions encompassing issues of 
bilateral and multilateral interests. The talks, in the presence 
of the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and the visiting 
polish President, Mr. Lech Walesa, resulted in three tentative 
agreements. 
  Finding a common view on the need to reform the U.N. system, 
the two countries decided to explore the possibility of jointly 
forwarding proposals for changes in the U.N. system, including a 
"change in the status of some countries." 
  Mr. Walesa later told presspersons that Poland shared the 
Indian view that there was need for a reform of the U.N., 
including making it more effective. In this context, Mr. Walesa 
announced that the representatives of the two countries at the 
U.N. would present a report on how the positions of the two 
countries could be coordinated and a joint initiative launched 
in this regard. 
  The second agreement on coordination at an international 
forum was in the context of the GATT. Here, the two decided to 
consult each other on specific issues, especially in the case of 
textiles in which India has substantial interests. 
  The third was in respect of jointly exploring business 
opportunities in third countries by pooling respective 
strengths. The private sector in the two countries would prepare 
the report in this context and present it to the respective 
Governments. 
  Giving a resume of his discussions with Indian leader's, Mr. 
Walesa said detailed talks had revealed that there were no areas 
of differences between the two countries. On the other hand, 
prospects of economic cooperation were immense and these should 
be exploited for mutual benefit. 
  On issues of nuclear weapons, the Polish President 
reiterated 
the position that his country was for a stop to nuclear 
proliferation after which the world should attempt to eliminate 
all weapons of mass destruction. "I know it is a difficult task 
and may not be achieved in my time. The next generation will 
have to strive for it," Mr. Walesa added. 
  Similarly, on human rights, Mr. Walesa said Poland was 
against violation of human rights in any part of the world. With 
Indian leaders, he said the discussions on this subject were 
general in nature and no specific instances or places were 
mentioned. 
<H5>  The best system </H5>
  The Polish President was repeatedly asked for his views on 
the trade union movement and the future of communism. To every 
query he stated that he believed in a strong trade union 
movement which could put pressure on the owners, either private 
or the State. "But the pressure should not be so strong as to 
kill the enterprise, like bacteria which eats away the vitals of 
the body," he added. 
  Mr. Walesa was also categorical in stating that he believed 
that the capitalist form of development was the best system, but 
not brutal capitalism which had exploitation as its main plank. 
"Some call it capitalism with a human face. That, I think, is 
what is needed." 
<H5>  Investment invited </H5>
  Earlier, the Polish President had a meeting with Indian 
industrialists where he invited investment. Stating that his 
country could serve as a stepping stone to the European market, 
he assured the industrialists that "every penny invested in 
Poland will fetch high returns." 
  Till the mid-eighties, Poland was one of the major trading 
partners in the Socialist bloc. However, with that country 
pulling out of the rupee trade agreement, bilateral trade shrank 
considerably. 
  Mr. Walesa expressed the hope that with his visit to India, 
bilateral trade and investment would go up considerably. The 
investment climate there was quite friendly and foreign 
investment was allowed in various segments of the economy, 
including portfolio investments, the industrialists were told.

<F P=106> [Article by Anand K. Sahay: "India, Iran Agree on Human </F>
Rights"] 
  [Text] Tehran, March 5. In an hour-long meeting between the 
External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, and the Iranian 
Foreign Minister, Mr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati, India and Iran today 
agreed that human rights should not be used as a political ploy 
against countries. 
  In a separate development, the Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr. 
Qian Qichen, who is also currently here noted that his country 
believed that issues such as human rights should not be used as 
a weapon to exert pressure on countries because, every country 
was ruled according to its own social and religious systems. 
  The identity of views thus emanating from three foreign 
ministers of leading Asian states appears to indicate growing 
political conversions on critical political issues in the 
international context. 
  The Indian and Iranian foreign ministers also agreed today 
that India and Pakistan should sort out their problem in Kashmir 
through bilateral negotiations. 
  These developments have led to interesting speculations here 
whether Iran would not abstain on the Pakistani resolution in 
Geneva, and go a step further and 
canvass...............[sentence as published] 
  Setting out the perspective for his two-day visit to Iran, 
the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, told THE HINDU 
before landing at the Mehrabad airport here that "India, Iran, 
China, the Gulf and ASEAN could form a tremendous basis for 
Asian cooperation." 
  While Mr. Singh is here for the seventh meeting of the 
Indo-Iran Joint Commission at the Ministerial level which would 
focus on enhancing economic and commercial ties to a prominent 
new level, it is difficult to miss the warm political 
undercurrents with which the External Affairs Minister's visit 
is awash. 
  The Indian and the Chinese Foreign Ministers are slated to 
discuss substantive bilateral and regional issues tomorrow. 
  This would only be their second one-to-one interaction, the 
last being at the session of the U.N. General Assembly in New 
York. 
  Mr. Singh is expected to suggest to his Chinese counterpart 
that the process of establishing peace and tranquillity on the 
line of Actual Control (LAC) between the two countries be 
speeded up with a view to relatively early realisation, rather 
than be allowed to languish like the earlier boundary talks. 
  On Kashmir, India could tell the Chinese dignitary that so 
far human rights had been a tool employed by the West for 
political purposes against developing countries. It was ironical 
that Pakistan should seek to exploit the same route at Geneva 
against India. 
  The Chinese anxiety naturally centres on Tibet, and Mr. Qian 
could take the opportunity of his meeting with Mr. Singh to 
convey his worries over an international conference of 
Parliamentarians on Tibet in the Indian capital later this 
month. It is expected that the External Affairs Minister would 
inform the Chinese dignitary that the Government of India had no 
role in the proposed conference. 
  Contrary to earlier belief, Mr. Singh would deliver a letter 
from the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao to the Iranian 
President, Mr. Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, whom he calls on 
tomorrow. 
  Mr. Rao is understood to have invited the Iranian President 
for an official visit. His letter may be expected to adhere to 
protocol norms of wishing more fulsome bilateral ties. 
  Mr. Singh told this correspondent that "There is tremendous 
possibility of close economic cooperation between Iran and 
India, and this could enhance prosperity in the whole region." 
  After a lull, India and Iran picked up the threads of their 
relations once again with a visit to India in March, 1992 by the 
Iran Foreign Minister. 
  This was at Mr. Velayati's own initiative. 
  Since then the pace of strengthening ties has been very 
quick. Mr. Velayati had urged taking bilateral relations to a 
higher level, and also cooperation with India at the Nonaligned 
Forum, clearly in view of the pressures brought against both 
countries by the U.S.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Diplomatic Victory for India"; all quotation </F>
marks as published] 
  [Text] The diplomatic misadventure of Pakistan in Geneva is 
paralleled only by its military misadventure in 1965. The issue 
at stake on both occasions was Kashmir. The diplomatic sparring 
that has been going on for the last few months between the two 
countries, beginning in Davos at the World Economic Forum and 
the Geneva events of the past one month will, in the long run, 
prove to be momentous for both countries. The jubilation in 
Indian diplomatic circles at the last minute withdrawal by 
Pakistan of a resolution on human rights violations in Kashmir 
is understandable. At no-time in the recent past has India 
managed to put it across to its opponent as far as diplomatic 
coups were concerned. In the last one month, it was heartening 
to see that India shed its low key diplomatic postures and 
launch a propaganda offensive against Pakistan as an exporter of 
terrorism. Having tasted success, the Indian think tank's 
proclivity to relax after wresting the initiative is unlikely to 
be seen this time around. Five years of low-cost, low-intensity 
conflict from across the border and the tension, uncertainty and 
the cult of violence that has come to grip the people of Kashmir 
is unlikely to be forgotten easily. Nor is it going to be easy 
for the Indian foreign policy-makers to forget the nerve 
wracking tension imposed on them till the very last minute 
before Islamabad bowed to the majority viewpoint of the members 
of the United Nations Human Rights Commission [UNHRC]. 
  The diplomatic disaster will not go down easily with the 
powers that be in Pakistan. Ms. Benazir Bhutto, who so fully 
identified herself with the resolution will now have to face the 
wrath of Muslim League leader, Mr. Nawaz Sharif. Embittered 
Pakistanis will only see defeat in the move to table the 
resolution and later its withdrawal as counter-productive. They 
will fail to see that Pakistan has successfully managed to 
project the Kashmir issue to an international audience. But, for 
the time being, there is certain to be massive opposition 
criticism and a backlash effect on Ms. Benazir Bhutto's 
government for the loss of face at an international forum, that 
too, in what is seen as a victory to India. Mr. Nawaz Sharif can 
be expected to take full advantage of the situation and harp on 
the fact that the Prime Minister has let down both Kashmiris and 
Pakistan and had bungled the whole issue. 
  The final result was made possible by the realistic stand 
taken by the member nations, particularly, China and Iran. 
Though the latter two countries have much to hide from UNHRC, 
that warrant their support to India, much the same can be said 
about most other nations of the world, including North America. 
The tactical withdrawal took place after it was agreed that a 
mission of ambassadors would visit Kashmir to assess the human 
rights situation there. It is now up to India to hammer home the 
advantage and press for meaningful bilateral dialogues. The 
foreign secretaries level meeting between the two countries held 
in January were a disaster. Dialogue needs to be renewed afresh 
with respect to `no-first-use' of nuclear weapons, `line of 
peace and tranquillity' along the Line of Control, 
demilitarisation of the Siachen Glacier, demarcation of the 
maritime boundary in the Sir Creek area, resolving the 
controversy over the Tulbul navigation project, and reviving the 
Joint Working Commission. The parleys between the two countries 
have been stifled by unreasonable postures by both countries, at 
different points of time, and no bilateral progress looks likely 
unless Pakistan drops the plebiscite, and now, the human rights 
violations proposals. Given the latest misadventure and the 
adverse fall out at home, one can only expect a hardened stand 
from the Pakistani side. It is thus left to India to put forth 
fresh proposals and wrest the initiative. Along with such 
confidence building exercises, the Government of India must 
ensure that the borders are tightly sealed and that drug 
trafficking and export of arms into the country are completely 
stopped. As far as the extremists and the militants are 
concerned, the failure of the resolution at UNHRC sends an 
unmistakable message that internationalisation of the Kashmiri 
issue does not work.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Triumph in Geneva"] </F>
  [Text] Pakistan's decision to withdraw its controversial 
resolution, criticising India's human rights record in Kashmir, 
from the United Nations Human Rights Commission meeting in 
Geneva is a singular triumph for Indian diplomacy. All those who 
participated at the Geneva event, from the finance minister, Dr. 
Manmohan Singh, and the minister of state for external affairs, 
Mr. Salman Khursheed, to the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] 
leader, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, and various officials deserve 
praise for their persuasive role as indeed do the Prime Minister 
and the external affairs minister. Procrastination followed by 
resolve is typical of the Indian style but it also has to do 
with the nature of democratic polity that functions best under 
pressure. After years of agonising and indeed dithering, India 
finally spelt out the bottom-line on Kashmir by telling the 
world what the Pakistani game was all about. The most important 
point related to the fact that Pakistan was attempting to use a 
U.N. forum for propaganda purposes despite its clandestine role 
in sponsoring terrorism. If it was genuinely concerned about the 
plight of the Kashmiris, it could have taken up India's offer 
made in January for talks rather than concentrate all its 
energies on the Geneva meeting. Eventually it took Iran, along 
with China, Syria, Indonesia, Malaysia and a number of other 
countries not unfriendly to Pakistan to tell it that such an 
issue is best handled through bilateral discussions. The 
congruence of interests in this context among India. Iran and 
China has portents for the future which Pakistan needs to 
examine carefully. 
  It is not very clear why Pakistan chose such a desperate 
course. Perhaps Ms. Bhutto was acting under domestic pressure; 
perhaps Islamabad misread the signals from Washington. There is 
more than a grain of truth in the government of India's charge 
that the United States by its recent utterances on Kashmir is 
responsible for the sharp deterioration in India-Pakistan 
relations. But Ms. Bhutto has no one but herself to blame for 
the distasteful and shrill tone of Pakistani statements last 
month. By calling Mr. Salman Khursheed a "rented Muslim," they 
were insulting a Muslim community bigger than their own and in 
calling India the "sick man of Asia," they ultimately compelled 
the latter to show the world where the basic cause of the 
disease lay. For years, India had been unable to utilise 
properly the mountain of material at its disposal, confirming 
Pakistan's involvement in the terrorist activities in the 
Kashmir valley. With the challenge in Geneva, it was able to do 
so in a convincing fashion, a task no doubt assisted by its 
willingness to encourage the representatives of various nations 
to see for themselves the grim realities of the state. Perhaps 
India felt compelled to act in Geneva because it could have been 
the beginning of a process that would have seen India being 
pilloried by the Organisation of Islamic Countries as well as by 
the U.N. general assembly later this year. By effectively 
countering the threat of being blamed for the wrong reasons, and 
by spelling out the limits of what it is willing to offer in 
Kashmir, India has forestalled such a possibility. Its next move 
should be to act swiftly to restore normality in the state.

  [Text] Geneva, March 4. India has cautioned the U.N. Human 
Rights Commission [UNHRC] about the threats posed to sovereign 
states by across-the-border sponsorship of terrorism and urged 
the global community to take necessary steps to enhance 
cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism, reports PTI. 
  "The need is to take cognisance of the urgency before it is 
too late. And to ensure that this recognition is made actionable 
without any delay," the Indian delegation has told the session 
of the U.N. Human Rights Commission. 
  Sharing with international community India's experience of 
the phenomenon of terrorism "which today looms as a spectre over 
the world and in its various forms and manifestations has come 
to signify a pervasive and organised threat to human rights in 
their widest form," Mr. Madhukar Gupta of the Indian delegation 
told the commission that "terrorism is now getting support from 
across international orders." 
  Mr. Gupta asked: "Is the international community going to 
continue to look on as a mute spectator, even as human rights 
slogans and fora are being used to cover the sponsorship and 
practices of terrorism?" 
  He said terrorism as witnessed in India was also a direct 
attempt to destroy the very structures and institutions of 
democracy, which alone provides the surest basis and foundation 
for civil society and the protection of human rights." 
  Mr. Gupta said "we have witnessed direct and targetted 
attacks on a massive scale on politicians, the judiciary, the 
press and government officials." 
  "These are the fundamental institutions of governance and 
the 
pillars of democracy. If these were to be destroyed, we could 
only have a situation where the law of the jungle would replace 
the rule of the law, where propaganda and disinformation on 
which terrorism thrives, would replace legitimate expression by 
the people through representative institutions and the media, 
and mechanisms for grievance redressal would become dependent 
upon the whims of those who promulgate dictats". 
  He said terrorism is also being used for the blatant spread 
of fundamentalism and creation of social and religious cleavages 
and divides in countries and societies. This has resulted in 
examples of "ethnic cleansing" and large-scale displacement of 
people in Jammu and Kashmir [J&amp;K]. 
  "We have witnessed efforts to change the very demographic 
profile of one particular part of the state -- Kashmir valley." 
  "Targetted and brutal attacks on members of minority 
community there have forced a massive exodus of thousands of 
people from their homes. All this has been accompanied by 
blatant attempts to whip up religious emotions and frenzy and to 
distort and radicalise religion, which has been resulted in the 
destruction of hundreds of schools providing modern, secular 
education, thus jeopardising the future of hundreds of thousands 
of children," Mr. Gupta said. 
  Addressing the session, Dr. Shakti Bhan, a member of the 
delegation of All-India Women's Conference, apprised the 
international community of the plight of the minority community 
in Jammu and Kashmir. 
  Dr. Bhan, a leader of the women's wing of Panun Kashmir, 
said 
"we are fighting a battle for freedom from terror, freedom from 
religious bigotry and fundamentalism which Pakistan is seeking 
to impose upon us, freedom from hatred and prejudice, and 
freedom from the fear of the gun which Pakistan is seeking to 
spread in our area." 
  She said "we want our thousands of years old culture of 
human 
unity and dignity back from the clutches of those who want to 
enslave us and are trying to hold us in terror." 
  Dr. Bhan urged the international community to "help us in 
this endeavour by pressurising Pakistan to stop proliferating 
terrorism, for on this depends the return of peace to our 
troubled paradise." 
  Meanwhile, some pro-Pakistan non-governmental organisations 
(NGO) have stepped up India-baiting by raising the bogey of 
rights violations in Kashmir, as it became clear today that 
Islamabad may go ahead with its resolution on Jammu and Kashmir 
at the U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) session here. 
  Spearheading the tirade on Kashmir was the International 
Educational Development (IED), a U.S. based NGO known for its 
pro-Pakistan stance. 
  The IED delegation raised the question of right of 
self-determination for the people of Kashmir.

  [Text] Geneva, March 5. India, in its first right of reply 
at the United Nations Human Rights Commission session here, said 
that the statement made by the leader of the Pakistani 
delegation, Mr. Iqbal Akhund regarding the self-determination of 
the Kashmiri people is "neither justified nor factual." 
  The former foreign secretary and envoy, Mr. T.N. Kaul, who 
exercised the right to reply said that Mr. Akhund's statement 
more closely reflected the "condition of people living in 
Pakistan occupied Kashmir and the northern territories where 
free and fair elections have not been held so far, where 
fundamental freedoms are suppressed ruthlessly." 
  "Even inside Pakistan, atrocities committed by Pakistani 
army 
and security forces in Sindh, Baluchistan, and the Frontier 
Provinces are well known," he said while objecting to Pakistan 
internationalising bilateral problems thereby making a solution 
more difficult. 
  Referring to the Shimla agreement signed when he was foreign 
secretary, Mr. Kaul said that what Pakistan was doing for the 
last four years was a blatant violation of this pact. It had set 
up training bases in PoK [Pakistan Occupied Kashmir] and in 
Pakistan itself for militants armed and financed and guided to 
commit acts of sabotage, subversion, loot and arson in both 
Punjab and J and K. "They have failed in Punjab and are failing 
in Jammu and Kashmir also. Hence, their attempt to 
internationalise the issue," he added. 
  Stating that he was born and brought up in Kashmir, unlike 
Mr. Iqbal Akhund, and some who did not even speak the Kashmiri 
language but claimed to be Kashmiris, Mr. Kaul rejected the 
accusation that "India's terrorism in Kashmir was supported by 
draconian laws." 
  "When misguided youths and local insurgents are aided, 
abetted instigated by a neighbouring country to commit loot, 
arson, rape and murder and drive at the point of the gun, 
minorities and even Muslims who do not agree with them, from 
their hearths and homes, no government worth its salt can shirk 
its duty to protect the people against such acts," Mr. Kaul 
replied. 
  Till the end of 1993, over 11,000 Kalashnikovs, 700 machine 
guns, 600 rocket launchers, 15,000 hand grenades besides 
wireless sets, rockets and a lot of ammunition and explosives 
had been captured, all supplied by the Pakistan ISI 
[Inter-Services Intelligence] to the insurgents, he said. A 
recently captured foreign mercenary admitted to having raped 85 
women, all Muslims, as there were hardly any non-Muslim women 
left in the valley. 
  Ms. Karen Parker of the International Educational 
Development, an NGO, demanded that, the promised plebiscite in 
Kashmir be conducted now so that the 40-year old UN resolution 
could be implemented. "The occupying power responds with the 
barrel of the gun, 600,000 strong, aimed at the Kashmiri people. 
Is this what the Commission means by democratic process?" she 
asked. The Kashmiris may not have oil, unlike Kuwait, but they 
had a passionate yearning for their promised plebiscite, she 
said. 
  The NGOs from Pakistan who spoke on the subject were Dr. 
(Ms.) Attiya Inayatullah of the World Muslim Congress and Mr. 
Syed Nazir Gilani of the World Society of Victimology. Mr. 
Gilani said that "while armed separatists were said to be 
responsible for kidnapping and killing government officials as 
well as members of the paramilitary forces and civilians, 
serious concerns had also been expressed over a large number of 
killings by the Indian security forces. Victims of torture 
included policemen, he said. The UN had procrastinated in its 
will and India had frustrated every opportunity to investigate 
the breach of these violations, he said. 
  Dr. Inayatullah, who has created some controversy because of 
her being chairman of the executive board of UNESCO as well as 
adopting the role of an NGO, relied on statistics provided by 
the All Parties Hurriyet Conference to depict the human rights 
situation in the Valley and called Dr. Farooq Abdullah a 
"quisling". 
  In an oral intervention by International Pen, the world 
association of writers representing members in 87 countries, Ms. 
F. Assaad said that Pen did not condemn anti-terrorist 
legislation per se and indeed recognised that legal 
measures were by far the most effective instrument in the 
struggle against violent insurgency. However, it was concerned 
that such legislation often including clauses which could lead 
to violations of the rights of those not advocating violence. In 
India, TADA [Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act] 
contained clauses which penalised the right of freedom of 
expression. It stated that such acts included views through 
speech or any other media.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 8: The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, announced on Tuesday the government's 
determination to put an end to `export of terrorism' by Pakistan 
into India and also to focus world attention on the basic case 
of Pakistan's illegal occupation of some areas of the Indian 
State of Jammu and Kashmir. 
  Replying to the discussion on the motion of thanks to the 
President's address in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Rao firmly declared 
amidst applause from members that the resolution recently 
adopted by Parliament on Kashmir would be implemented "in letter 
and spirit" and the government would foil any attempt from any 
quarter to interfere in the internal affairs of India. 
  The House later adopted the motion with voice vote, 
rejecting 
the Opposition amendments. 
  This was probably the first time that the Prime Minister 
came 
out with a statement indicating that India would now go in for a 
counter-offensive against Pakistan's propaganda about violation 
of human rights in Kashmir. He also termed Pakistan as an 
`aggressor'. 
  A total rejection of the demand for carving out of new 
States, a strong defence of the Dunkel proposals, a rebuttal of 
the slogan that India was buckling under outside pressures in 
economic matters and an assurance that the government would have 
talks with party leaders to decide on electoral reforms and the 
issue of identity cards to voters were the highlights of the 
Prime Minister's hour-long speech. 
  Mr. Rao's speech was bold, assertive and aggressive and drew 
cheers from the treasury benches. Obviously, the government 
securing a clear majority in the House emboldened the Prime 
Minister. 
  On the Ram Janmabhoomi controversy, the Prime Minister said 
the Supreme Court was seized of the matter and hearing has 
started. He appealed to the members not to be agitated over it 
because once the Supreme Court gives its opinion, action would 
be initiated on the lines of opinion. The government would come 
to the House and take its opinion and arrive at a consensus 
after the court verdict. 
  Mr. Rao pointed out that a look at the President's addresses 
during the last three years would clearly bring out the change 
that was taking place every year. The year 1992 reflected the 
economic crisis facing the country and the reforms proposed, 
1993 referred to the threat to the very survival of India as a 
nation and its secular character while 1994 started on a note of 
optimism, on which they have to build up now. 
  On Kashmir issue, he said there existed two, three 
complications which needed to be disentangled. The government 
was dealing with utmost patience and firmness the problem of 
Pakistan exporting terrorism into the Valley. This had to be 
tackled on many fronts. The latest the government thought of was 
the need to intensify development efforts in Jammu and Kashmir. 
More details in this regard would be given to the House at the 
appropriate time. The need for involvement of people in 
development activities and better coordination was given 
attention to. 
  He said Pakistan was creating problems for India and harping 
on violation of human rights in Kashmir out of its own internal 
compulsions. India had to face the situation. "Our record is 
clear. Wherever there are excesses, action is being taken". To 
say that there was violation of human rights in Kashmir is 
factually wrong and "we refuse it". 
  The Prime Minister declared that terrorism in Kashmir would 
be put down with an iron hand and the territorial integrity of 
India would be protected. Nothing would come in the way of 
efforts in this direction. The sufferings of people of Kashmir, 
as a result of terrorism, should be ended. "We are determined to 
see that export of terrorism from Pakistan is stopped". 
  Stating that Pakistan's propaganda against India on human 
rights was "totally uncalled for", he questioned Pak's 
locus standi to raise the issue when it was an 
aggressor. In this context, he said that India's basic case on 
Kashmir had taken a back seat, while irrelevant issues like 
human rights had come to the surface. The world has to be told 
about this. 
  Mr. Rao referred to the demands for new States gaining 
momentum and made it clear that the "time and the situation do 
not warrant carving of new States". "This is no time for us to 
open the Pandora's box for new States", he said and assured that 
steps would be taken to develop the backward areas, keeping in 
view the demand for creation of Jarkhand, Uttarakhand, etc. 
short of carving of new States, ways to solve the problems of 
backward areas and better treatment to them would he attended to. 
  Terming the problems being faced in the North East as 
`complex', he said that the region needed special attention and 
the government was giving greater attention to stop infiltration 
from outside. 
  The Prime Minister said that on the whole the situation in 
the country had stabilised now, creating confidence among the 
people outside and within the country that the economic activity 
had now been accelerated. Following this, massive investments 
were coming to the country in infrastructure sector. "Never 
before did we have a shot in the arm as we are having today", 
but much more needed to be done. 
  He pointed out that the massive step up in the outlay for 
rural development from Rs [rupees] 7,000 crore in the Seventh 
Five Year Plan to Rs 30,000 crore in the Eighth Plan reflected 
the government's determination to develop rural areas. The 
impact of the schemes on rural poverty and rural unemployment 
were studied by independent groups and it was revealed the 
benefits were accruing to rural people. 
  He said that the outlays for rural development in the Ninth 
Plan was proposed to be fixed at Rs. 90,000 crore. Rural areas 
would be blooming with activity, he added. 
  Mr. Rao ridiculed the slogan that the government's decisions 
were influenced by international agencies. Whatever the 
government was doing was "totally" its own plans based on the 
needs of the people. It was not correct to say that decisions 
were taken at the instance of outside agencies. 
  He stated that the Dunkel proposals have become "a horse 
that 
was already dead", but everyone was still flogging it. "I have 
gone into every aspect of the Dunkel proposals, particularly on 
the agriculture side. I reiterate that on the agriculture side 
we have nothing to lose, but we are having much to gain", he 
declared. 
  The Prime Minister further said that exporters of 
agricultural products would get a shot in the arm due to Dunkel 
proposals. "I don't find Indian farmers suffering anywhere 
because of the Dunkel". 
  Responding to interruptions from Opposition members, he 
assured them that the government was prepared for a debate on 
the Dunkel proposals. Certain comments being made on these 
proposals stating that the interests of the farmers would be 
adversely affected were totally baseless. 
  When Mr. Nitish Kumar (JD [Janata Dal]) said that the 
farmers 
would have no right to multiply the seeds, the Prime Minister 
shot back saying that India would have its own law in this 
regard. The Bill would be coming in this session itself. 
  Mr. Rao gave the details progress in the implementation of 
the three schemes introduced by the government in 1993 for the 
benefit of the poor, particularly rural women and urban youth 
and also the schemes meant for welfare of Scheduled Castes, 
Scheduled Tribes and other weaker sections. 
  Clarifying the points raised by Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan (JD), 
Mr. Somnath Chatterjee (CPI-M [Communist Party of 
India-Marxist]) and Mr. Jaswant Singh (BJP [Bharatiya Janata 
Party]) and others, the Prime Minister said that he would 
consult leaders of political parties on electoral reforms, issue 
of identity cards and other allied matters. Stating that the 
government had no bias on any of these matters, he said that 
whatever was decided by all the parties would be implemented. He 
said he would convene a meeting of party leaders to discuss the 
issue. The government would not take any hasty decision, he 
assured. 
  He said that the progress of implementation of land reforms 
during the last two years was commendable. 
  Mr. Rao told Mr. Paswan that the government had not shelved 
any programme meant for the welfare of Scheduled Castes and 
Scheduled Tribes initiated by the earlier JD government. On the 
other hand, the government had added new schemes. 
  He said the Finance Minister would give details about the 
action taken on JPC [Joint Parliamentary Committee] report on 
securities scam. On Bofors investigation, he said the government 
was yet to receive the documents from Geneva Cantonal court.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: "PM Conveys Message to U.S."] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, March 8. The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, was noticeably cautious in his references to the 
Indo-U.S. relations--while briefly dealing with foreign policy 
matters in his reply to the Lok Sabha debate on the motion of 
thanks to the President's address. 
  While Mr. Rao pointedly mentioned the progress on economic, 
cultural and other fronts, he roundly talked of certain 
statements from Washington which had generated misgivings. But 
instead of elaborating on the second issue or dealing 
specifically with the points of disagreement, he merely repeated 
the implied references in the President's address -- "We look 
forward to working with the United States towards mutual 
understanding, including those issues on which such 
understanding needs enhancement. This will reflect the vibrant 
democratic and secular ideals of our two countries". 
  Paraphrasing the President's words, Mr. Rao said there were 
areas where understanding was lacking and the address made the 
country's stand clear. Mr. Rao confined himself to recalling 
that the Home Minister (Mr. S.B. Chavan) had explained the 
government's position in Parliament the other day. Now Mr. 
Chavan had used strong words against Washington's stand, taking 
exception to the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton's statement at 
the credential presentation ceremony of the new Pakistan 
Ambassador that "we share Pakistan's concerns about human rights 
abuses in Kashmir". Mr. Rao, however, chose not to elaborate any 
of the points, dealt with by the Home Minister. 
  In his reply to the debate in the Rajya Sabha later, the 
Prime Minister maintained the same cautious line. India's 
response, he said, had to be calibrated and "if a statement 
comes and next day there is clarification, you have to take it 
together. We are not in the habit of knee-jerk reaction." 
  The net result of the two pronouncements is that India on 
the 
one hand made its stand abundantly clear on the "statements from 
Washington", while, on the other hand, it projected a posture of 
caution at the highest level. None in Washington was left in any 
doubt about the feelings of the Government (as also of the 
political parties and various sections of public opinion). At 
the same time, none in the U.S. Administration could link the 
Prime Minister with tough words against the American attitude to 
India. Even otherwise, Mr. Rao had avoided commenting on the 
"statements from Washington", a euphemism for Mr. Clinton's 
recent references to Kashmir -- contained, apart from the 
credential ceremony speech, in the President's address at the 
U.N. General Assembly and in his reply to a private American 
citizen, connected with a blatantly anti-India outfit -- as also 
his statements on Punjab. New Delhi left it to the foreign 
office spokesman to reply to what were regarded highly 
objectionable points. 
  By recalling Mr. Chavan's strongly-worded statements, Mr. 
Rao 
impliedly provided the endorsement. That the Home Minister's 
off-the-cuff observations was evident from the way he repeated 
his points, first made in the Lok Sabha, in the Upper House -- 
and that, too, after the U.S. Embassy here conveyed its 
unhappiness, in a letter to Mr. Chavan, with a copy to the 
External Affairs Ministry. On March 2, Mr. Chavan (in the Lok 
Sabha) charged the U.S. with developing a vested interest in 
Kashmir and wanted the country to be on guard, adding that 
Washington was interested neither in helping India nor Pakistan, 
"they would like to help themselves". He was equally sharp in 
criticising the U.S. interference in Jammu and Kashmir. 
  On March 4 (in the Rajya Sabha), Mr. Chavan, while dealing 
with the U.S. Embassy's unhappiness with his earlier statement, 
stood his ground and reiterated his charge of interference 
against the U.S. 
  The exploratory talks through diplomatic channels for a 
meeting of the Prime Minister and Mr. Clinton are unlikely to be 
affected (in view of Mr. Rao's caution). That New Delhi's stand 
was made clear was an important factor.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 10: Pakistan had withdrawn 
voluntarily and unconditionally on Wednesday its 
loudly-publicised draft resolution it moved on February 25 at 
the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) at Geneva on 
alleged violation of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir. 
  This is nothing new for Pakistan. This is the third time in 
a 
series when Pakistan repeated the performance. For the first 
time it moved such a draft resolution at the UNHRC session in 
Geneva last year and for the second time at the 48th session of 
the UN General Assembly in 1993. Despite much propaganda and all 
the fanfare that followed, it refrained from tabling such a 
draft. On all these occasions it failed to mobilise necessary 
support. 
  India hopes that these failures would induce Pakistan to 
look 
at all outstanding Indo-Pakistani bilateral issues, including 
the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in a constructive way and agree 
to start talks with India with a view to settling the issues 
bilaterally. 
  This hope was expressed by the new Foreign Secretary, Mr. 
Krishnan Srinivasan, at his first-ever press conference here on 
Thursday that lasted for about 30 minutes. 
  Mr. Srinivasan also hoped that Pakistan's response to the 
six 
non-papers India gave to Pakistan and the Indian response to 
Pakistan's two non-papers would be constructive and soon the 
Foreign Secretary-level dialogue would resume. 
  Giving the details of what happened in Geneva on Wednesday, 
the Foreign Secretary stated that the Iranian resolution, which 
facilitated the Pakistani withdrawal, was unilateral. 
  Claiming that India was always confident of winning the 
vote, 
Mr. Srinivasan stated "we wanted the vote to be held at the 
earliest" as we were confident a majority of those voting would 
go against Islamabad. 
  He said the withdrawn resolution stood automatically lapsed 
and Pakistan would have to start de novo at the next 
session of the UNHRC. This was confirmed by the United Nations 
secretariat as there was confusion whether the resolution was 
deferred till the next session. 
  Mr. Srinivasan said although Pakistan had announced its 
intention a day earlier to amend the resolution by dropping the 
reference to sending a fact-finding mission to Kashmir, it 
remained in its original form till the last moment. The dilution 
of the resolution was intended to gain the support of more 
countries as a majority of them did not want to get involved in 
a territorial issue. Also, the resolution had not mentioned the 
country to which the fact-finding mission would go. 
  Before the resolution was withdrawn, Iran made a statement 
that India had agreed to facilitate the visit of a group of 
Ambassadors of Islamic countries to visit Kashmir. 
  Besides Iran, 15 countries, including China, Syria, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Tunisia, Libya, Nigeria, Brazil and 
Australia, asked Pakistan to withdraw the resolution. 
  He denied that there was any linkage between the Pakistani 
withdrawal and the Iranian suggestion for team of Organisation 
of Islamic (OIC) countries Ambassadors' visiting Jammu and 
Kashmir. The Iranian suggestion was not binding on India. 
  But any Ambassador stationed in India, excepting those of 
Pakistan and Libya, could visit any part of India, including 
Jammu and Kashmir, and report to his government as fact-finding 
was the normal duty of an Ambassador, the Foreign Secretary 
asserted. "They are most welcome to do that," he added. 
  Mr. Srinivasan pointed out that Ambassadors of 10 countries, 
including four Islamic nations, were already in Kashmir Valley 
to see things for themselves. One of the Islamic nations was 
Senegal, the present chairman of the OIC. Three others, 
including Iran, were to join them but could not do so due to 
preoccupation. There was no restrictions. India was prepared to 
extend whatever help these Ambassadors require, he added. 
  Mr. Srinivasan said that there was no scope for Iran or any 
other country on to mediate the Kashmir issue. 
  Referring to Iran's statement at Geneva on Wednesday that it 
would continue to work towards resolving the Kashmir issue, Mr. 
Srinivasan made it clear that India was neither bound by it nor 
did it constitute mediation. India had not made any compromises 
on the issue, he stated emphatically. 
  He added that Iran had made the statement on its own 
initiative and New Delhi would welcome it if Teheran succeeded 
in persuading Islamabad to create a climate for a constructive 
dialogue between India and Pakistan. 
  The Foreign Secretary lauded the role of Iran and China in 
persuading Pakistan to withdraw the resolution unconditionally. 
  Mr. Srinivasan said Pakistan, despite making at a prestige 
issue, had to withdraw the resolution unilaterally because of 
lack of support. The Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, had 
telephonic talks with many heads of government and State to 
enlist support for her country's resolution. 
  The Pakistan government even deputed senior ministers and 
officials to various countries for this purpose. 
  He said the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit 
to 
Germany and the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh's 
meeting with the European troika and French leaders helped to 
place the Indian viewpoint more clearly and lucidly. These 
interactions proved vital for support to the Indian stand. 
  He said India had been able to convey the cause of human 
rights violation in the State and Pakistan's attempt to 
internationalise the issue in violation of the Shimla agreement. 
He said there was a great transparency in "our policy towards 
Kashmir."

  [Text] Gandhinagar, March 4. The ruling Congress suffered 
a severe setback today as it could win only two Rajya Sabha 
seats against the expected three. The voting pattern not only 
revealed disunity between the erstwhile JD(G) [Janata 
Dal-Gujarat] and the `original' Congress but massive 
cross-voting in favour of the Opposition BJP [Bharatiya Janata 
Party]. 
  The BJP won the other two seats though it had a strength of 
only 67 in the House of 178, enough to get only one. The party 
managed 24 `extra' votes and its little known nominee, Mr. 
Kanaksinh Mangrola topped the four winners with 49 votes. The 
party favourite, Ms. Anandiben Patel got 42 votes and stood 
second. Two votes were declared invalid. 
  The Congress stalwart, Mr. Madhavsinh Solanki retained his 
seat with 33 votes and his runner-up, Mr. Raju Parmar maintained 
his seat with 28 votes. The third candidate, Mr. J.V. Shah could 
get only 25 and lost the battle. With the support of nine 
independents and a lone member of the Lok Swaraj Manch, the 
Congress strength of 98 had officially got augmented to 108. 
<H5>  Jolt to Urmila </H5>
  The defeat of Mr. Shah, a hot favourite of the former JD(G) 
controlling 66 votes in the CLP [Congress-I Legislature Party], 
is considered to be a severe jolt to the claim of Ms. Urmila 
Patel, to succeed her late husband, Chimanbhai Patel. 
  If the talk in the lobby of the Assembly is any indication 
in 
the light of the poll outcome, then the Congress is in deep 
trouble. The JD(G) faction has already served an ultimatum to 
the party high command that under no circumstances would they 
accept a leader who did not belong to their ranks. On this 
point, the two feuding claimants of the faction, the second 
being the interim Chief Minister, Mr. Chhabildas Mehta, are 
united. 
  The ruling party has now two options. It should either 
dissolve the House and impose President's rule to enable the 
party prepare for the general elections, due next winter or just 
instal a compromise candidate, winning over a substantial number 
of JD(G) legislators promising them tickets. 
  The BJP is overjoyed. The party had worked overtime to 
entice 
the disgruntled elements and to particularly win the three votes 
of the Janata Dal (VP Singh). 
  "The Congress with its just 32 votes has bagged two seats 
and 
the JD(G) with its 66 votes has got nothing," said the party's 
poll manager and deputy leader, Mr. Suresh Mehta while stressing 
that the Government is now a minority one.

<F P=106> [Article by Mohit Sen: "CPI's Debacle in UP"] </F>
  [Text] An absolutely sensational development has taken 
place in Uttar Pradesh [UP] as far as the Communist Party of 
India [CPI] is concerned. And all said and done it is the CPI 
which is the main Communist formation in that sprawling and 
strategic State of the heartland of India. What happens to it is 
of the greatest relevance to all Communists there and throughout 
the country. 
  What has happened is that practically the entire veteran 
leadership of the CPI in Uttar Pradesh has collectively decided 
to join the Samajwadi Party led by Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav. 
These leaders include Mr. Mitra Sen Yadav who was at the time of 
his leaving the CPI the secretary of its Uttar Pradesh unit, an 
MLA [member of Legislative Assembly] from Fiazabad, just 
adjacent to Ayodhya. Joining him are Mr. Guru Prasad, for long 
the assistant secretary of the Uttar Pradesh unit of the CPI and 
for some time the all-India president of the Agricultural 
Labourers' Organisation of the CPI and Mr. Ramchander Baksh 
Singh, the veteran leader from Banabanki district and the sole 
CPI representative in the UP Legislative Council. 
  The most important of the rebels is Dr. Z.A. Ahmad. There 
are, of course, reports that he may not quit the CPI though he 
has not so far denied that he is with the rebels. He has, 
however, made it absolutely clear on many occasions that his 
sympathies lie with Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav, whom he believes 
represents the wave of the future for defeating the BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party] and advancing towards the emancipation 
of the oppressed. Dr. Ahmad is no ordinary leader of the CPI. It 
would be appropriate to recall just who he is. Coming from a 
highly placed family in the undivided Punjab he became a 
Communist in London in the early 1930s where he worked 
successfully for a doctorate in the London School of Economics. 
He, along with Sajjad Zaheer and Hiren Mukherjee, were the first 
of the "England returned" Communists to be followed a decade 
later by Mohan Kumaramangalam, Indrajit Gupta, Nikhil 
Chakravarthy, N.K. Krishnan and others. On returning to India he 
plunged into the freedom struggle and soon drew attention to 
himself as that rare phenomenon of a highpowered intellectual 
who was also a mass worker. On top of it all he came from a 
distinguished Muslim family and was an ardent secularist, 
patriot and radical. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru took him to the 
AICC [All India Congress Committee] headquarters in Allahabad as 
one of his secretaries when he was the president of the Congress. 
  Among the other secretaries of Panditji was Dr. Rammanohar 
Lohia. The two learned lieutenants of the then Congress 
president got on well together since both strongly supported 
their leader's combining patriotism and nationalism with 
socialism. Dr. Lohia was just the opposite of what he later 
became. He was then a Nehruite. Dr. Ahmad was right from those 
days a convinced proponent of the need for Congress-Communist 
unity and also of the need to pay special attention to weaning 
the Muslim masses away from the influence of communalism. 
  Dr. Ahmad went on to become one of the tallest and best 
known 
leader of the then single CPI. He was a member of its all-India 
leadership from the forties and has been there in one or another 
official position for over half-a-century. It has to be said to 
his credit that he never accepted the official thesis of the CPI 
that the Muslim League and its demand for Pakistan represented 
the freedom urge of the Muslims and their desire for equality 
with the Hindus though in a distorted form. He never accepted 
that the content of the demand for Pakistan was just though the 
form was perverse. 
  Much the most important characteristic of Dr. Ahmad was, 
however, his belief and personification of that belief that the 
Communists should also be Congressmen. All through his political 
life he has worn khadi and a Gandhi cap. He represented the very 
important tradition which is still alike in Uttar Pradesh of 
radical and revolutionary nationalism, i.e., of Congressmen who 
accepted Communism in one or another form and of Communists who 
accepted the Congress whatever its form. It is on the basis of 
this belief that he staunchly opposed the anti-national and 
so-called "Left" revolutionary line of Mr. B.T. Ranadive in 
1948. He equally staunchly opposed the anti-Congress, 
obsessively anti-Nehru and "casteist socialism" of Dr. Lohia. 
  The tragedy of Dr. Ahmad, however, began, in the mid-1950s 
when for personal and factional reasons he opposed P.C. Joshi's 
call for a National Front of Congress, Communists and all 
progressives. From then onwards in one or another way he did his 
best to deny his past and to remain a Communist leader on the 
basis of accepting anti-Congressism in howsoever a sophisticated 
form. So down the slippery path he went till he landed up as the 
drum beater and pillion rider of Mr. V.P. Singh whom he 
portrayed as the new Messiah of the secularists and the 
downtrodden. He accepted what he had so valiantly fought in the 
"first fine careless rapture" of the passionate idealism of his 
Communist youth. 
  The CPI leaders and veterans who have gone or deciding to go 
to the Samajwadi Party have been motivated by various impulses. 
High on the list is the authoritarian behaviour of the Central 
leadership of the CPI which forced its UP unit to align -- 
unsuccessfully in the matter of seats, as it turned out -- with 
the Janata Dal of Mr. V.P. Singh. The MP [Member of Parliament] 
unit had wanted to ally with the Samajwadi Party because, in 
their view, it was the party most capable of defeating the BJP 
and also because it was not completely anti-Congress as 
demonstrated by it conduct during the no-confidence motion in 
the Lok Sabha. The so-called "young" leaders being encouraged at 
the Centre and in the States by the small coterie which 
functions as the effective all-India leadership of the CPI also 
cause concern and even a measure of revulsion among the 
veterans. The most influential factor behind the decision -- of 
the CPI veterans in UP is, however, their lack of courage in 
breaking with anti-Congressism. They are trapped by the decades 
of anti-Congress campaigning within and outside their party that 
they have done. It is a Frankenstein which they cannot fight but 
have to obey. 
  Their anti-Congressism, however, is of a somewhat subtle 
variety. It is an anti-Congressism which postulates an 
alternative to the Congress which is also not with the BJP and 
can even ally with the Congress but which, in any case, not with 
Right reactionary or counter-revolutionary formation. On no 
account can they prove even to themselves that the Samajwadi 
Party is more anti-imperialist, more nationalist and more 
secular than the Congress. As for being more effective than the 
latter in combatting the BJP this is true at the present moment 
in Uttar Pradesh. Elsewhere it is the Congress which undeniably 
occupier that preeminent position. Would Dr. Ahmad and his 
colleagues of UP advise that counterparts in other parts of 
India to join with the Congress on the basis of that logic? 
  In Andhra Pradesh, for example, it cannot be claimed that 
the 
TDP [Teluga Desam Party] is more capable of rallying the secular 
forces than the Congress. Nor can the same claim be made for the 
DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] in Tamil Nadu. The erstwhile CPI 
veterans cannot blame their critics who change them with joining 
the Samajwadi Party for the sake of seats and other perks of 
power. They can answer their critics to some extent, out any 
rate, if they advocated what can be called the criterion of 
"anti-rightist effectiveness" as the basis of party and personal 
behaviour. This would clearly imply that allying with the 
Congress is a legitimate choice for communists. It would have 
important positive consequences for political alignments in the 
context, in particular of the elections due at the end of the 
year. 
  There is, however, a more basic point that needs to be made. 
The Samajwadi Party is not just an anti-BJP party. It is a 
specific type of anti-BJP party. It bases itself in reality, 
whatever be the figleaf rhetoric, on backward casteism and 
Muslim communalism. This is becoming clearer with every passing 
day. What else is the meaning of the caste clashes that are 
taking place in Uttar Pradesh and the rift that is so clearly 
developing between Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mr. Kanshi Ram? 
The situation in Uttar Pradesh has developed quickly only 
confirmation that one fragmenting force cannot be relied upon to 
combat another. In the end both conflict with modern and 
progressive nationalism which alone can be the basis of our 
country and people's advance.

  [Text] Agartala, March 1. -- A new regional party under the 
banner of United Regional Party of Tripura [URPT] was formed 
here yesterday, reports UNI. 
  Announcing this, the party leaders addressing a press 
conference here today said the main work of the party would be 
to protect the socioeconomic and political interest of the 
backward tribals and other ethnic groups. 
  A 10-member committee has been formed with the senior most 
CPI(M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] leader, Mr. Ashok 
Debbarma, as its convenor. They said that the Tripura National 
Volunteers [TNV], ruling Left Front's partner, Tripura Hill 
People's party, Tripura Upajati Juba Samity's youth wing, Tribal 
Students' Federation and the Tripura Upajati Karmachhari Samity 
would be the partners of the new body. 
  Mr. Debbarma, a founder member of the Communist Party in 
Tripura in the late 40s, along with the present Chief Minister, 
Mr. Dasaratha Deb, the former Chief Minister, Mr. Nripen 
Chakraborty, and the veteran Communist leader and former 
Minister, Mr. Biren Datta, alleged that the Left Front had 
failed to protect the interests of the tribals. 
  Mr. Debbarma announced that the URPT would launch a 
statewide 
movement in support of the genuine demands of the tribals from 
this month-end. 
  It would also support the TNV's raasta roko 
agitation, slated to begin from March 3 in protest against 
non-implementation of the tripartite TNV peace accord, signed on 
August 12, 1988. 
  Mr. Debbarma and the other leaders further alleged that all 
the political parties, including the ruling Left Front, had 
bluffed the tribals and were not sincere for the all-round 
development of the tribals.

  [Text] Bombay, March 2. BBC radio will broadcast a half 
hour current affairs programme on South Asia every day from 
April 4. This was announced on Tuesday in Bombay by Mr. 
Alexander Thomson, the editor of the South Asia Report, which at 
present has a duration of 15 minutes. 
  "The expansion of South Asia Report at this time shows the 
commitment of the BBC to coverage of a region of immense 
political, economic and strategic importance," he said. Mr. 
Thomson and BBC's India correspondent, Mr. Mark Tully were in 
Bombay to honour Mr. Jonas Kurkalang from Dadar, Bombay, one of 
four prize winners of the `Can you hear me' competition 
conducted last year by the South Asia Report. Amongst the other 
prize-winners are two from Madras and one from Nepal. 
  New office in Delhi: Mr. Tully pointed that the 
very fact that the BBC was increasing its coverage of South Asia 
emphasised the point that the organisation continued to be 
deeply committed to radio journalism. `Radio is not going under 
and will not despite television', he said. He announced that the 
BBC was opening a new and modern office in Delhi which would be 
equipped to produce many of the programmes on the Hindi service 
which had earlier been produced in London. 
  Mr. Tully also emphasised that it was the success of BBC 
World Service television in India that had sparked the interest 
of so many others in the region. `The BBC is determined to 
remain one of the main players regardless of how much 
competition there is', he said. He also pointed out that 
although Star TV had been taken over by the Australian media 
baron, Mr. Rupert Murdoch, BBC had a contract with Star TV and 
"there is no sign that it will be broken even though it has an 
early get out clause." 
  Reorganisation: Discussing the future plans of the 
BBC, Mr. Thomson said that `Bush House is going through 
fundamental reforms, almost a revolution in its history'. He was 
referring to the process of reorganisation taking place whereby 
the BBC planned to divide its coverage of the world into six 
regions. The eastern region would essentially be restricted to 
South Asia unlike in the past when it encompassed Iran and 
Afghanistan in the west and Myanmar in the east. 
  As part of the expansion of its coverage of the region, the 
BBC would be setting up an FM transmitter in Dhaka, Bangladesh 
and a studio in Islamabad, Mr. Thomson said. This was the only 
region where the BBC was expanding at a time when it was cutting 
back in many other parts of the world. 
  Mr. Thomson also announced that in response to feedback from 
listeners, the BBC would broadcast in South Asia on a new 
frequency of 7160 in addition to the present 15310 on which it 
was being broadcast. The expanded South Asia Report would begin 
with a nine minute world news bulletin at 0700 hrs IST [Indian 
Standard Time] followed by the current affairs programme.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 1. -- Air India [AI] and Indian 
Airlines [IA] today, formally, began functioning as two public 
limited companies, paving way for what is widely perceived as a 
new chapter in better management and more competitive 
functioning in aviation. 
  While Government control over the two airlines continues, it 
is believed to be only a matter of time before private 
participation is invited -- through widening of capital base of 
IA and A-I -- in running the air carriers. 
  According to an official announcement here, while A-I, IA 
and 
Vayudoot will continue to provide scheduled air transport 
services, air taxi operators (ATO) have been permitted to apply 
to the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation [DGCA] for 
permission to operate private scheduled airlines. 
  The ATOs would, however, have to first comply with certain 
guidelines and regulations laid down by the Ministry of Civil 
Aviation for obtaining permission. The guidelines, according to 
officials, have been given the official seal after subjecting 
them to discussion with the key player of the domestic aviation 
industry last month. 
  The rules of operation are: 

  -  A fleet strength of at least three aircraft registered in 
India with an all-up-weight of more than 5700 kg each 
  -  Not less 
than Rs 15 crores subscribed equity capital in respect of 
operators having aircraft of all-up-weight exceeding 40,000 kg, 
and not less than Rs 5 crores for operators having aircraft of 
all-up-weight not exceeding 40,000 kg 
  -  Not less than three sets 
of flight crew and cabin crew per aircraft. 
  -  An approved 
maintenance organization and facilities to carry out maintenance 
of aircraft up to 500 hours inspection or Check "B" for Boeing 
737 aircraft. 
  -  Approved manuals for operations, training and 
quality control-cum-maintenance. 
  -  Cells for pre-flight medical 
examination of crew, flight planning and despatch, reliability, 
analysis of aircraft components and systems, detect 
investigation, compliance of service bulletins and modifications 
and records of major components. 
  -  Security programme approved by 
the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and trained security 
personnel at all operating stations. 
  The Ministry has also laid down certain conditions for 
operating on different sectors. 
  (a) Those operating scheduled air transport service on any 
route specified under Category - 1, will be required to provide 
a minimum scheduled service in Category II and Category III 
sectors. For rendering the prescribed minimum service on routes 
in Categories II and III, an operator may have the option to 
provide the service either by aircraft in his fleet or in 
another operator's fleet on mutually agreed terms. In the latter 
case, the arrangements should have prior approval of the DGCA. 
  (b) Operators shall abide by any further conditions which 
the 
DGCA may consider necessary for monitoring of scheduled air 
transport service and operation.

  [Text] While a debate rages on over the real extent of the 
hike in the defence budget announced in Parliament last month, 
the fact remains that it provides little for any worthwhile 
modernisation or major acquisition. Defence, ironically, 
continues to remain a low priority area for a country which has 
fought four wars and still faces a proxy war. In the present 
defence environment, each of the three arms is important. 
Ignoring one at the cost of the others would be far from 
judicious. 
  For the navy and the Indian Air Force (IAF), the prevailing 
resource crunch and the low budgetary allocation is an issue of 
particular concern. While the army is manpower-oriented, both 
the navy and the air force are dependent on technology and 
capital. Both these requirements go together, ruling out any 
scope for compromise on either. 
  For the IAF, the going has been particularly worrisome. Even 
the air chief had conceded at a news conference at the Bangalore 
air show last December that managing the IAF with the prevailing 
resource crunch was "damn tough". 
  The reality is indeed harsh. Not only have modernisation 
plans suffered, but also the operational capabilities of the air 
force, which had performed heroically in the 1971 Indo-Pak war. 
Worse, the IAF has become an aged air force, with a fleet that 
is almost obsolete in today's state-of-the-art en vironment. And 
tragically for the IAF, the onset of the decline has coincided 
with the Gulf war, which has left no doubt about the vital role 
air power will play in future wars. 
  Most of the IAF aircraft are Soviet-made and very old. Over 
half of the IAF's combat aircraft need to be replaced or 
upgraded. The IAF, like the other two services, is faced with a 
severe resource crunch following the collapse of its 
long-standing defence ally, the Soviet Union. Further, it lacks 
an advance jet trainer (AJT), is short of spares, lacks adequate 
modern electronic equipment, weapon systems and force 
multipliers, and needs a better air defence ground environment 
system (ADGES), including more sophisticated early warning 
systems and surface to air missiles (SAMs). 
  There is an absence of any strategic thinking on the part of 
defence ministry policy-makers, who are mostly bureaucrats with 
little experience or professional understanding of defence 
issues. The three services have been reduced to begging for bare 
essentials. 
  The bulk of the IAF's 39 combat squadrons comprises the 
MiG-21 fighter-intercepters. Nine of these squadrons, which are 
of 1960s vintage, are beyond upgradation and ought to have been 
phased out years ago. But there is simply no money. Also, the 
MiG-21 bis squadrons urgently need upgrading with modern 
avionics and weapon systems. Unfortunately, the government 
continues to procrastinate, paying little heed to the cost and 
time-sensitive frame needed for this frontline defence aircraft. 
These need to be operational for at least 15 more years so as to 
be replaced with the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), scheduled to 
fructify by 2005. 
  The four MiG-23 BN (ground attack) squadrons are similarly 
outdated and are in the process of being replaced by the MiG-27, 
an updated version, currently being assembled by HAL [Hindustan 
Aeronautics Limited] at Ozhar (Maharashtra). The MiG-27, of 
which the IAF has squadrons, is a uni-role tactical air strike 
aircraft (TASA), which again has a limited range. About four 
years hence, these too will require upgradation. Thus by 2005, 
the MiG-27 fleet is more likely to resemble today's MiG-21 
fleet, with little scope for replacement. 
  A similar picture is that of the Jaguars. This British 
strike 
aircraft, currently being assembled by HAL in Bangalore, is of 
early 1970 vintage. The 4.5 squadrons available to the IAF 
comprise half a squadron of the maritime strike version, the 
only squadron of its kind in the IAF. Of the remaining four 
Jaguar squadrons, two squadrons require urgent upgrading. 
  Thus, the only modern aircraft with the IAF today are the 
two 
squadrons of the French state-of-the-art, fly-by-wire, 
multi-role Mirage-2000 aircraft and three squadrons of the 
Soviet MiG-29 uni-role air superiority aircraft. In January, the 
IAF had lost a Mirage-2000 to a bird hit, taking the total of 
Mirage-2000s lost so far to four. In early February, the IAF 
lost a MiG-29 taking the number of MiG-29s lost also to four. 
While the Mirage-2000, then valued at Rs 43 crore, was inducted 
in 1985, the MiG-29 entered the IAF only in 1987. 
  While the IAF continues to maintain its aged air force, the 
Pakistani and Chinese air forces, by contrast, have been 
involved in a steady modernisation programme. Despite the 
Pressler amendment, not only has the PAF [Pakistan Air Force] 
managed to regularly service and get, spare parts for its F-16s, 
but also reportedly managed to increase flying hours on its 
F-16s by about 10 per cent. 
  The IAF top brass is convinced that the US, will find some 
way to deliver 71 more F-16s that are being sought by the PAF, 
the Pressler amendment notwithstanding. Should that happen, the 
government will have no option but to provide funds to buy 
additional aircraft in order to make up for the imbalance caused 
by this induction into the PAF. The IAF has already submitted a 
proposal for inducting a squadron each of the Mirage-2000 and 
the MiG-29. 
  A tempting option is to reduce the force level of the IAF 
and 
make it into a leaner and meaner force. This would mean 
compelling the IAF to think carefully about its roles and 
missions and start taking tough decisions. 
  But the IAF rules out this option, pointing out that threat 
perceptions have only increased and not reduced. They point to 
India's vast border and the huge army which will need air 
support in case of a war. The only option, according to them, is 
a more realistic budget in keeping with the security environment 
that prevails in India's neighbourhood. While the government 
confines its concerns to the intentions of a foreign government, 
the armed forces are more concerned with the capabilities of 
real and potential adversaries. Intentions can be temporary, but 
capabilities take time to build and are permanent.

  [Text] Bangalore, March 8. The Department of Space and 
Arianespace have signed an agreement for launching the INSAT-2C 
and INSAT-2D multipurpose communication satellites being built 
by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in the second 
half of 1995 and 1996. 
  The agreement was signed by the ISRO Chairman, Prof. U.R. 
Rao, and Arianespace Chairman, Mr. Bigot, in Paris on March 4, 
according to an ISRO press release issued here this evening. 
  Arianespace was selected to launch the satellites after a 
thorough evaluation of request for proposals received from 
various leading commercial launch services in the international 
market. 
  The second generation INSAT satellites were being built by 
ISRO. INSAT-2A and INSAT-2B, launched on July 10, 1992, and July 
23, 1993, by Arianespace, were working `very satisfactorily' and 
providing various services. 
  The INSAT-2C and INSAT-2D, weighing around 2,100 kg each, 
would add to the capacity available for communications. They 
would carry 3 KU-band transponders in addition to the C-band, 
S-band and extended C-band transponders. The C-transponders will 
have increased power levels that will enhance TV coverage 
capabilities and business and remote area communication services. 
  For the first time in the INSAT system, mobile satellite 
communication services will also be introduced. Using this 
facility, vehicles fitted with suitable equipment could 
communicate with their offices or other vehicles while on the 
move. 
  INSAT-2C and 2D will not carry meteorological instruments 
and 
will have double-sided solar panels providing about 1,600 watts 
of electric power to operate the equipment on board the 
satellite.

  [Text] The current revolutionary courts throughout the 
country will be dissolved and then these courts will be formed 
anew where necessary, at the discretion of the chief of the 
judiciary. According to a bill that has been approved by the 
Majles and has become law, dealing with charges such as 
threatening the nation's domestic and foreign security, warring 
with God's representatives or corruption on the earth, insulting 
the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, armed activities 
and assassinations, destruction of institutions for the purpose 
of opposing the government, spying for foreigners and crimes 
related to smuggling and narcotics, will be handled by the 
revolution courts. 
  The verdicts by the revolution courts are final except in 
cases involving execution and stoning to death, Islamic 
penalties, personal vengeance, confiscation of assets, and blood 
money in excess of one-fifth of the full blood price. The 
convicted person can request an appeal, and in this case the 
judicial proceedings will be turned over to the appeal courts, 
which will convene in the province centers. Under this law, the 
general courts must replace all the various existing courts and 
they will have the jurisdiction to hear penal, civil and 
nonlitigious cases (nonlitigious cases are matters such as 
appointing guardians for minors and other such things, where the 
issuance of a verdict will not harm or benefit anyone). 
  The chief of the judiciary, whose prerogatives have 
increased 
under this law, is required within no more than five years of 
the law's effective date gradually to form the general courts 
and revolution courts and to create conditions for this law's 
implementation throughout the country. From the time of the 
formation of the general and revolution courts in each judicial 
precinct, all conflicting laws and regulation in those precincts 
are void. 
  Several days before this bill was approved in the Majles, 
Shushtari, the minister of justice, discussed the "great changes 
facing Iran's judicial apparatus." He said that all the nation's 
judges must prepare themselves to implement this law. He said: 
It took 12 years to prepare this bill. 
  An informed legislative source who did not want his name 
disclosed, said: If properly implemented, this law will probably 
eliminate some of the confusion that now exists in Iran's 
judicial apparatus. He also mentioned the right to request an 
appeal on heavy sentences such as execution, stoning and 
personal vengeance. Although these can be positive steps, the 
existence of sentences such as stoning to death and confiscation 
of assets shows the reactionary and worn-out essence of the 
nation's judicial apparatus. According to him, "warring against 
God's representatives and corruption on the earth" are cases 
where there is no specific accusation, just as putting the crime 
of insulting the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the 
same level with endangering national security also shows the 
oppressive essence of the Islamic regime. 
  He said: One must wait to see if courts such as the special 
clerical court, the military court, the religiously prohibited 
crimes court and others will be dissolved or not.

  [Text] About 48 hours after decisively declaring that 
satellite dishes are "illegal" in Iran and ordering the police 
to collect them, the minister of the interior did a 180-degree 
turn and said the government still has not made a final decision 
on this matter and that until this decision has been made no one 
has the right to make trouble for the owners of these antennas. 
  Our sources report from Tehran that government agents 
secretly took aerial photographs from the rooftops of Tehran. 
After seeing these photographs the leaders of the Islamic 
Republic realized that there are too many of these antennas for 
the police to be able to collect them. 
  Prior to this, the chief of the Police Antismuggling Office 
threatened owners and importers of this type of antenna "in 
whatever rank or position they may hold" with "legal" penalties. 
  The reactions, however, especially from the Majles, were 
very 
instructive for the minister of the interior. One deputy accused 
him of "speaking rashly" and another, noting the 12 years of 
fruitless struggle against videos, said efforts to collect 
satellite dishes will not serve the goal of "fighting the 
cultural invasion." 
  Various sources estimate the number of satellite dishes in 
Tehran at between 200,000 and 300,000, and at up to 450,000 
throughout Iran. 
  In an interview with the publication TEHRAN TIMES, 'Ali 
Mohammad Basharati retracted his harsh words about collecting 
the satellite dishes and said: Antennas that receive satellite 
television programming are not illegal, but the government has 
decided to discuss them in the next month. Therefore, the use of 
satellite dishes must be approved by the government. 
  Basharati discussed the things the press wrote about his 
remarks on collecting these antennas. He added: A commission to 
include representatives of the Islamic Propaganda Organization 
and the minister of culture and guidance will set the laws and 
regulations on the use of satellite dishes. In this interview, 
Basharati also announced: Until the Council of Ministers makes 
its announcement and a statement is issued by the Ministry of 
the Interior on this matter, no one has the right to collect 
satellite dishes. If someone goes to homes for this purpose, the 
home owner should report him to the nearest police station. The 
TEHRAN TIMES wrote that after the minister of the interior 
announced his opinion that satellite dishes were illegal, it 
created the worry that there might be trouble for those who use 
these antennas. The minister of the interior said: The subject 
of satellite dishes is being studied. It will take a month to 
get a conclusion from the research that will lead to a decision. 
The Council of Ministers will announce the final decision. 
  The TEHRAN TIMES writes: Satellite dishes have been 
installed 
extensively on the rooftops in Tehran in the last two years. The 
minister of the interior said: The Council of Ministers is 
making a decision on the laws and regulations for the use of 
satellite dishes, and the Ministry of the Interior will have the 
responsibility of enforcing them. 
  Last week 'Ali Mohammad Basharati said: No law is needed to 
collect satellite dishes. The Ministry of the Interior views 
them as a form of corruption, like other kinds of pollution and 
the cultural invasion. Therefore, it will not wait for a law to 
be approved to collect them from the rooftops. After Basharati's 
remarks, and in view of the past experiences with assaults on 
homes by thugs and ruffians, the trouble the revolution guards 
and committees caused with their intrusions into the homes of 
Iranians since the beginning of the revolution and the repeated 
thefts and killings committed by people bearing membership cards 
in revolution groups, Rafsanjani and others asked him to retract 
what he said. 
  Following the minister of the interior's remarks about 
collecting the satellite dishes, in some cities, including 
Shiraz, revolution guards and irresponsible individuals went 
into homes on their own initiative and took the antennas. The 
next day the confiscated antennas turned up in the markets and 
were sold at lower prices to others. 
  After the statements by the minister of the interior on his 
own initiative about the satellite dishes, and before he 
retracted his remarks, the general manager of the Police 
Antismuggling Office announced at a press conference that 
satellite dishes are a smuggled item and that their owners would 
be dealt with as smugglers. He said a project called the "Kusar 
Project" was being prepared under which "an extensive campaign 
against various kinds of smuggling deals" will begin. 
  He said since goods that are not listed on the nation's 
import and export guidelines are considered smuggled goods, 
satellite dishes, which mostly come into Iran through the 
northern ports of the Persian Gulf, are subject to this 
prohibition. "Satellite dishes throughout the country are 
considered smuggled goods and will be confiscated." 
  Citing the minister of the interior, he also said: "The 
minister of the interior, in comments published in the 
newspapers...said there has been no change in his views as 
minister of the interior and those of the government concerning 
the collection of satellite dishes." 
  However, after the minister of the interior did a 180-degree 
turn in less than 48 hours, Morteza Nabavi, an influential 
Majles deputy and editor of the newspaper RESALAT, said in a 
Majles speech that although viewing some of the programming 
broadcast by satellite has "bad effects," a "reactionary 
approach" should not be taken. He called upon the minister of 
the interior to "speak more deliberately." Addressing the 
minister of the interior, he said if there is "order with regard 
to the satellite dishes, there will be no need to collect them." 
It would have been better, before announcing the decision to 
collect the satellite dishes, if the minister of the interior 
had "weighed all the aspects of the matter." 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam Zadsar, Majles deputy from Jiroft, said 
concerning this: "Collecting these receivers will solve nothing. 
It will only have minor short-term effects." He added: "The 
foreign invasion must not instill fear," because "the religious 
beliefs of the people will prevent them from dominating us." 
  It is still not clear whether the minister of the interior 
said these things on his own initiative or after discussing the 
matter with the Council of Ministers. 
  On the other hand, the Majles has also gotten into the fray. 
It has announced that a law is needed to collect satellite 
dishes. Therefore, the law must be approved by the Majles and a 
government edict on this matter is not sufficient. 
  KEYHAN's sources report from Tehran that after the remarks 
by 
the minister of the interior, the government ordered that 
precise aerial photographs be taken from the rooftops of Tehran. 
These photographs showed that there are too many of these 
antennas for the police to be able to collect them. 
  Various sources estimate the number of satellite dishes in 
Tehran at between 200,000 and 300,000, and at up to 450,000 
throughout Iran.

  [Text] After a relatively short interruption, efforts to 
elevate 'Ali Khamene'i to the level of source of emulation have 
begun anew. The new element in this effort is that this time 
'Ali Meshkini, Yusef Sane'i, Mohammad Fazel Lankrani, Judari 
Amoli, and Ebrahimi from Qom Seminary have joined the effort. 
Before this, Mohammad Yazdi and 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri said in 
Tehran that Khamene'i is qualified in every way to serve as 
source of emulation. Meanwhile, Ahmad Azer-Qomi, one of the most 
influential clergymen in the government, says only ambiguous 
things on this subject. 
  In a statement published in Iran, 'Ali Meshkini wrote that 
it 
is religiously lawful, reasonable, and incumbent on all the 
Muslims of the world, "both Shiite and Sunni," especially the 
clergy and the high scholars and all those who want the Islamic 
revolution to continue, to accept His Excellency as chief 
theologian and vice regent of the Muslims of the world. 
  Reacting to 'Ali Meshkini's call, a statement was published 
in Qom rejecting 'Ali Khamene'i's competence in relation to that 
call "for reasons of religious law and reason." In this 
statement, which was distributed secretly in Qom, and a copy of 
which also reached KEYHAN, "essential problems and objections" 
were raised against Meshkini's remarks. The statement asks, what 
position is to be given to Mr. Khamene'i? Is he to be ranked as 
a person with independent discretion in matters of religious 
jurisprudence, leader of the Islamic Republic or vice regent of 
the Muslims? If Meshkini wants to rank him as a person with 
independent discretion in matters of religious jurisprudence, 
two things could happen: He will either consider himself higher 
than him, "better than him," so to speak, or lower. If he 
considers himself higher, then asking the people to follow him 
will be inappropriate, and if he considers himself lower, then 
in that case a person of lower rank cannot appoint another 
person to a position of higher rank in independent discretion in 
matters of religious jurisprudence. This would be "unworthy 
innovation, in violation of the current traditions in the 
seminary centers." 
  The statement emphasizes that "independent discretion in 
matters of religious jurisprudence for Mr. Khamene'i was never 
approved by the late Imam. If he had considered Mr. Khamene'i 
qualified, he would have confirmed him in writing or verbally." 
The statement notes: In those days when Khamene'i was president 
of the republic, he said at a Friday prayer sermon at Tehran 
University: "Whenever Salman Rushdie repents, his sin will be 
forgiven...." Ayatollah Khomeyni, disturbed, reprimanded him: 
"Who gave you permission to express your views on these kinds of 
theological and religious law issues?" 
  Mr. Khamene'i, chanting that only God has power, said: I am 
not a person with independent discretion in matters of religious 
jurisprudence. I am a follower of the source of emulation, like 
His Holiness the Imam's other followers. 
  The statement says Khomeyni was disturbed not because he 
disagreed with Khamene'i as a person with independent discretion 
in matters of religious jurisprudence, but because he did not 
consider him to have the competence of a person with independent 
discretion in matters of religious jurisprudence. Otherwise, 
"differences among those with independent discretion in matters 
of religious jurisprudence on matters of religious law and 
theology is commonplace, and no person with independent 
discretion in matters of religious jurisprudence corrects 
another for expressing a theological point of view." 
  As an example the statement cites the case of Ayatollah 
Montazeri, who repeatedly expressed views contradicting 
Khomeyni's clear decrees. "Since the Imam considered him to be a 
person with independent discretion in matters of religious 
jurisprudence, he never reprimanded him for expressing a 
conflicting theological point of view..." 
  The statement says if the intent was to confirm the rank of 
leader of the Islamic Republic, "this does not require the 
issuance of a new statement, especially after five years." 
  However, if the intent was to elevate Khamene'i to the rank 
of regent, Meshkini should take note that in his book, A 
Rejection of the Secrets of A Thousand Years, Ayatollah 
Khomeyni said only the imams can exercise regency over the 
affairs of Muslims, and that "shahs, caliphs, and rulers are not 
regents." In the same book "he curses those who say that anyone 
but the chaste imams can exercise regency over the Muslims..." 
  The statement, addressed to those who issued the order 
granting Khamene'i the rank of regent in the affairs of Muslims, 
warns that with acts like this "they are shaking the pillars of 
Shiite emulation authority" and "they have distorted the truth 
and then derived his overall position and rank from that." 
  The statement adds: "Is it possible to address someone whose 
position is no higher than the third echelon in the clerical 
hierarchy in some other way, and present him as someone whom all 
the Muslims of the world must follow and obey, merely by 
publishing a few announcements and statements?"

  [Text] Three-fourths of Iran's northern forests have been 
destroyed in the last 15 years. The transfer of living soil from 
high ground to the rivers and plains and the rate of 
sedimentation in the mouths of rivers has become much faster and 
more evident, and it has not been without effect in creating 
problems for the coastal cities. If we continue at this rate, 
the useful forests in northern Iran, which have trees usable in 
industry, will be destroyed in the next five years. This is part 
of a report from the monthly publication JAME'E-YE SALEM, 
published in Tehran, entitled "Iran's Environment," written by 
Dr. 'Ali Hazuri. 
  The report's author continues: In the last two years we have 
seen faster and more extensive soil erosion throughout Iran. 
However, these events are mostly happening in areas where there 
were formerly forests or suitable plant cover and have now 
become bare, such as the heights of Gilan, Mazandaran, Chahar 
Mahal va Bakhtiari, and Doshmanziari in western Fars. 
  The rate of sedimentation at dams has increased and no 
solution has been found. Even in places where resources come to 
hand suddenly and with the help of nature, there is nothing we 
can do. 
  In the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] the water 
levels at Iran's dams were much lower than in the year 1370 [21 
March 1991-20 March 1992]. For example, at the Zayandehrud Dam 
it was about seven meters lower. As a result of the falling 
water level, a great volume of the sedimentation at the mouth of 
the dam reservoir rose out of the water and could have been 
removed with ordinary equipment. Clearly, the readiness to do 
this task did not exist and no work was done. 
<H5>  Pastures and Fields Overrun </H5>
  An important part of Iran's fields and pastures has been 
destroyed in the last 30 years because of the increased 
population, the spread of the cities and the establishment of 
factories, warehouses, and military bases. Even now, instead of 
building these kinds of installations on unsuitable land, they 
are using best lands for this purpose. For example, the metal 
foundry plant, was built next to the city of Asfarin, was 
allocated the best agricultural land next to the city. After its 
construction, this plant took over almost all the irrigated land 
adjacent to the city, and even the city itself is threatened by 
the creation of pollution. The day when cheap fuel is no longer 
available for these factories and they are faced with closure, 
their land will also be of no use, and they will be absorbed by 
the rapid expansion of the cities and the population explosion. 
  In his report, the author also discusses the destruction of 
forests in other parts of Iran in recent years. 
  There is no small number of other areas in Iran that have 
lost their plant cover in recent years. The Doshmanziari area, 
which was completely forested in the year 1357 [21 March 1978-20 
March 1979], has now lost perhaps two-thirds of its trees. In a 
trip there last summer, I did not recognize many areas I had 
seen before. I even needed a guide to identify the area and the 
likely limits of areas I knew, and the soil erosion and the 
destruction of the environment in this region is also evident. 
  The stripping of Iran's pastures is an obvious phenomenon, 
which anyone can see throughout Iran. This is also the result of 
the population increase, including the tribal population, and 
greater need for livestock products. 
<H5>  Sounding of Alarms </H5>
  The author of the report on Iran's environment discussed the 
death of Iran's green forests, pastures and agricultural fields, 
and the extinction of animals such as the elephant of southern 
Iran, the lion throughout the south and east of Iran, the tiger 
in Mazandaran, and the deer of Azerbaijan. According to him, 
these were not destroyed by the earthquake, but rather when many 
Iranians in these years obtained firearms and shot them with 
bullets. Of course, there was even more savage treatment of the 
boar herds in Lorestan and Mazandaran. 
  He also warns about the stripping of pastures and increasing 
air pollution. He said: The aggregate of the factors mentioned, 
along with poverty, ignorance and illiteracy, inability to tell 
the difference between immediate and long-term profits, and to 
understand the earth as the cradle of humanity, the spread of 
profiteering and rapacious production, which has little by 
little had its effects on agriculture and animal husbandry and 
entails indifference to nature, sound the alarm for a healthy 
life in Iran's environment. 
  The pollution of bodies of water, even important ones like 
Zayandehrud, dumping poisons such as cyanide into the river, the 
death of ancient beliefs about keeping water pure, the dumping 
of garbage into the water by government agents, the 
disappearance of ugliness in polluted water, the flow of sewage, 
sometimes in a city like Masjed-e Soleyman, rapacious use of 
resources in such a way that, for exampl,e all the farms and 
rural areas surrounding the Sar Cheshmeh Copper Mines (from 
Miduk to the north of it to Pariz to the south of it) are 
threatened with destruction, do not indicate a bright future for 
the environment of Iranians. 
  This is no longer anything like freedom or human rights for 
two sides to negotiate, for one to say it exists and the other 
to say it does not. The reality is naked and dangerous. The 
small deserts and plains, which can now be seen throughout the 
province of Fars to the shores of the southern sea, were 
formerly forest. There were once wild oak and fig forests 
throughout the province of Khorasan and the province of Sistan 
va Baluchestan. During the Sassanian period they harvested 
cochineal from these trees and cochineal was known as the color 
of Khorasan. Iran was verdant, the deserts were few and the 
people of Iran were comfortable.

  [Text] Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the Islamic 
Republic, who has recently (the last time was in his New Year's 
message to Iranians inside the country) been describing the 
economic situation as bright and rosy, in his Friday prayer 
sermon of 26 Farvardin (15 April) spoke of "strange injustices" 
and "the lack of health in the nation's economy." He said this 
abnormal situation is the result of the subsidies the government 
is paying to meet society's consumer needs. 
  Rafsanjani said: Overall, the government is paying 600 
billion tumans, or in other words, one-fifth of the total 
general budget, as subsidies. In this figure, revenues from oil 
sales that could have been obtained at the OPEC price ($13 per 
barrel) but were not, were not included. Rafsanjani noted that 
in Iran 1.4 million barrels of oil and 800,000 barrels of gasoil 
is consumed daily and provided to the consumer at the cost of 
production. He said: "We have no revenue from it" and that the 
money collected is only enough to meet the costs of refining, 
shipping, and distribution. 
  Rafsanjani divided government subsidies into the "unjust" 
and 
"just" categories and said: The classes with high incomes use 
some subsidies in the same way that the low-income classes use 
them, and this is not "just." 
  In the midst of this, the newspapers supporting continued 
subsidies write that since 80 percent of the people of Iran are 
living below the poverty line, 16 percent of the budget is being 
spent "in the right direction," and only 4 percent of it reaches 
the wealthy in the form of subsidies. 
  In any case, the elimination of subsidies will mean that a 
new wave of high prices will engulf Iran's society. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: While in France the government has 
an annual income of $40 billion from energy, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran sells oil products to consumers at the cost of 
production, and it derives no revenue from it. 
  Rafsanjani said: Not counting the price of oil, every year 
600 billion tumans is spent on subsidies, and this is one-fifth 
of the nation's total budget. The president of the Islamic 
Republic said: Most of the subsidies are spent on basic goods 
such as wheat, sugar, vegetable shortening, rice, and meat. This 
comes to 300 billion tumans and is half the government's total 
subsidies. 
  He said these kinds of subsidies are a kind of "oppression" 
to the nation because of the fact that they are used the same 
way by both rich and poor. 
  "Unfortunately," he said, "we perpetrate this oppression 
that 
spends the public's money for people who do not need it." 
  While enumerating the subsidized items, Rafsanjani said: The 
government pays 40 billion tumans to the Imam's Aid Committee, 
40 billion tumans to the Martyr Foundation, 5.5 billion tumans 
to insurance for "vulnerable" classes, and 1.5 billion tumans to 
help former prisoners of war. He said this help is of the "just" 
type. 
  He said the subsidies for bread and fuel are among the 
"unjust" ones, because both rich and poor use them the same way. 
  Rafsanjani gives 21 billion tumans in aid for the 
government's pilgrimage trip, but he said nothing about whether 
that is just or not. The pilgrimage, according to the scripture, 
is incumbent upon those who are "able" to make it. 
  On the other hand the Tehran media, which is opposed to 
eliminating the subsidies, wrote in criticism of what Rafsanjani 
said that in view of the fact that 80 percent of the people are 
below the poverty line, 16 percent of the subsidies reach the 
needy classes. The same newspaper writes, based on the president 
of the republic's analysis, in the new year one must expect 
higher prices and more pressure on the people (the same 80 
percent) without anything being done to counteract this 
pressure. They conclude: "Of course if the elimination of 
subsidies leads to job creation and production, it is possible 
the people will welcome it." 
  However, economic experts do not consider the creation of 
jobs and incomes for the vulnerable classes to be that likely in 
today's Iran.

  [Text] The newspaper SALAM, quoting IRNA, printed a report 
on the excessive population increase in Iran and sounded the 
alarm. This report, which was prepared based on the Islamic 
Republic's official statistical sources, does a good job of 
showing the dark future the excessive population increase has 
spread before Iran. Below is a summary of this report for your 
consideration: 
  In the last 90 years, meaning from 1280 [21 March 1901-20 
March 1902] to 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992], Iran's 
population has increased sixfold, and it is predicted that in 
the next 20 years it will increase to more than 120 million. 
According to the 1370 census, Iran's population was 55,837,163, 
and in the last two years this figure has exceeded 57 million. 
  Iran, with a population growth rate of 3.9 percent, had the 
highest population growth rate until a few years ago. The 
nation's population officials say that the population growth 
rate has now decreased to 2.3 percent (the experts believe that 
such a decrease in the population growth rate is not possible in 
a few years. Various sources in the Islamic Republic give 
differing statistics on Iran's population growth rate. Experts 
estimate this rate at between 3 and 3.5 percent). 
  According to this report, the number of women of 
child-bearing age will increase from 13,628,000 in the year 1372 
[21 March 1993-20 March 1994] to 16,138,000 in the year 1377 
[21 March 1998-20 March 1999]. Likewise, 6.5 births are expected 
for each Iranian woman, which according to the report, 
"unfortunately" equals the rate in the African continent and in 
some developing nations. 
  Another problem in Iranian society is the extraordinarily 
youthful mix of its population. Based on the 1370 census, the 
population between zero and 14 years of age totaled 24,723,000, 
and counting those born in the years 1371 [21 March 1992-20 
March 1993] and 1372, one must add another 2 million to this 
number. That is, more than 26 million of Iran's 57 million 
people are between zero and 14 years of age. 
  Based on the figures in the National Statistical Annual, 55 
percent of Iran's population is younger than 19 (meaning 
40,640,000), and 62 percent of the nation's population is under 
25. The average age for men is 23.41 years, the average age for 
women is 21.83 years, and the average age for the entire 
population is 22.13 years. Population experts cite illiteracy, 
the lack of social welfare and ignorance of the effects of 
increasing families as some of the causes of the population 
increase in Iran. These experts believe that even if the 
country's population growth rate completely stopped today, it 
would take at least 20 years to compensate for the population 
increases of the last 15 years, meaning the era of the 
government of the Islamic Republic. 
  Contrary to the way it appears in Tehran, where the women 
are 
working as shopkeepers, laborers, and merchants more than in the 
past, official statistics show that the number of women working 
in the 1355 [21 March 1976-20 March 1977] census was 1.2 
million, whereas in the year 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] 
that number decreased to 970,000, and yet in the last 15 years 
the number of women in the country increased by more than 12 
million. 
  To see the effects of this rapid growth on the people of 
Iran 
in the next 20 years, IRNA's report studied food and agriculture 
and their relationship to the population increase. It wrote: For 
suitable cultivation in the country, at least 4,000 mm of 
rainfall is required, but in Iran the average rainfall does not 
exceed 250 mm, and only 34 percent of that is actually used due 
to improper utilization, while the rest is wasted. 
  According to a statement from the Environmental Protection 
Organization, an average of 4.5 percent of the northern forests 
is lost every year. This means that theoretically in 23 years 
there will be no trace of a forest in the north. A total of 1.5 
million tons of the best and most appropriate arable soil, which 
is equal to 400,000 hectares [ha] of the nation's fruitful soil, 
is eroded as a result of excessive grazing, and if something is 
not done the erosion of fruitful soil will triple. 
  Likewise, close to one-fourth of the nation's area is taken 
up by the Lut Plain, the Kavir Plain and other barren lands, 
while forests only make up 1 percent of the nation's total area. 
  In view of the nation's 12.5 million ha of agricultural 
land, 
this much land can only feed 50 percent of the nation's current 
population, and the rest of the food must be imported. Currently 
the annual per-capita consumption of wheat is at least 230 kg, 
and the entire nation's annual consumption of wheat is 13 
million tons. 
  If we accept the Ministry of Agriculture's statistic that 10 
million tons of wheat was produced last year, Iran is currently 
faced with a shortage of 3 million tons of wheat, which is 
imported using foreign exchange resources. 
  If we assume that per-capita consumption will remain fixed 
over the next 20 years, then at the end of that time with a 
population of 120 million the country will need 27 million tons 
of wheat. Even if the area of arable land is not reduced, Iran 
will be short 14 million tons of wheat. 
  If the price of wheat remains at its current level of $250, 
about $4 million of the nation's foreign exchange credits will 
be needed annually just to import wheat. 
  The minister of agriculture said in this regard: It cannot 
be 
predicted when the nation will become self-sufficient in wheat 
production.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Umar Idris] </F>
  [Text] Saudi sources disclosed to AL-HAYAH that SAMA, the 
Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, issued during the first quarter 
of the current year development and treasury bonds valued at 22 
billion riyals [SR] ($5.8 billion). 
  The same sources stated that a few days ago the sixth and 
last issuance of the development bonds for the first quarter was 
made; the cost was SR1.5 billion ($400 million). This makes the 
total value of development bonds so far issued at SR9 billion 
($2.4 billion). During the same period SR13 billion ($3.4 
billion) of short-term treasury bonds were issued three times. 
  The banking sources indicated that the Saudi development 
bonds are one-to-five-year bonds. Interest on these bonds is 
paid every three months. The interest rate is 4.3 percent. Each 
bond is SR5 million ($1.3 million). 
  Interest on short-term treasury bonds is paid at the 
maturity 
date of the bond; these are 30-90-day bonds. Each bond is SR1 
million ($266,000) 
  The banking sources described the return on these bonds as 
acceptable, that it changes according to the changes in the 
world market, and that it is linked to the changes in the 
interest rate on the dollar. Due to the difference between the 
values of the riyal and the dollar, the interest rates on these 
bonds are 0.3 percent higher than those on American treasury 
bonds. 
  The same sources stated that local banks buy these bonds 
because they find it a convenient means to make use of the great 
liquidity they have. If the local bank needs liquidity, it can 
reverse the bonds to SAMA as a temporary mortgage for a fixed 
period after which the local bank gets back the bonds and 
liquidity returns to SAMA. Such a procedure is an important 
banking method to control the monetary bloc. The sources also 
reported that big Saudi investors prefer to own these bonds as 
soon as SAMA puts them on the market. 
  The sources indicated that sales from bonds issued during 
the 
first quarter of the current year were used to pay back the 
value of previous bonds owed to banks and companies. 
  There are indications that SAMA first issued development and 
treasury bonds in 1989 when the government decided to enter as a 
major borrower from the banking market. The government started 
by getting a domestic loan of SR25 billion ($6.6 billion). In 
the ensuing five years, the value of treasury bonds doubled as 
bonds valuing SR120 billion ($32 billion) were issued in the 
Saudi banking market. 
  The same sources expect that during the current year new 
development and treasury bonds worth SR30 billion ($8 billion) 
will be issued.

<F P=106> [Article by Muhammad al-'Ariqi: "Sanaa Has Not Bought Any </F>
Prohibited Weapons Or Poisonous Gases"] 
  [Text] A responsible source in the General Committee of the 
General People's Congress [GPC] has denied what has been said by 
the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] about some responsible 
agencies in Sanaa undertaking the purchase of prohibited weapons 
and poisonous gases. The source was responding to accusations by 
'Ali Salim al-Bid, the secretary general of the YSP, made when 
he received the members of the National Dialogue Committee in 
Aden. The source said that such statements tend to arouse 
misgivings concerning the extent to which Yemen is committed to 
international agreements, and the source demanded that the YSP 
refute these statements. 
  In addition to this, GPC sources also denied news items 
mentioned concerning elements of the forces loyal to 'Ali Nasir 
Muhammad in Sanaa leaving their camps and joining the forces 
that are serving the YSP. They described these news items as 
fabricated and untrue. They said that the opposite is what 
happened--that camps belonging to the military units located in 
Sanaa and al-Bayda' have received hundreds of individuals who 
have fled the camp of the Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar and the 
camp of the 3rd Brigade in 'Imran, in addition to a number of 
recruits who had joined the military units located in Aden and 
Shabwah which served the YSP. The GPC sources said that they 
justified their desertion by saying that they were protesting 
the actions of some of the YSP leaders who sought help from the 
sultans who were fighting against the Yemeni revolution. 
  In addition to this, Yemeni newspapers yesterday said that a 
clash occurred recently between the northern and southern forces 
and that this resulted in five persons being killed in the 
Shabwah area. However, a northern source vehemently denied this, 
saying that what happened was a clash between two tribes, which 
resulted in only two persons being killed.

<F P=106> [Article by Muhammad al-'Ariqi: "Yemeni President Demands </F>
That Dialogue Committee Oversee Airports and Ports to Make Sure 
Internationally Prohibited Weapons Are Not Imported"] 
  [Text] Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has demanded 
that the Political Forces Dialogue Committee [PFDC] make the 
decision to oversee all airports and seaports in the Republic of 
Yemen in order to make sure that there is no importing of 
weapons or military equipment and hardware from abroad and in 
order to prevent breakdowns in the military situation. He gave 
assurances that the General People's Congress [GPC] would adhere 
to any decision made concerning this. 
  During his meeting the day before yesterday with the members 
of the PFDC, the Yemeni president denied the news that had been 
circulated concerning Yemen's importing internationally 
prohibited weapons. He expressed his profound regret concerning 
the circulation of rumors such as these, which have no basis in 
fact. The president welcomed the decision arrived at by the PFDC 
and the Council of Ministers in the meetings recently held in 
Aden, and he expressed his hope that the transition to the 
application phase would be completed. He demanded that the PFDC 
rely upon clarity and frankness when issuing warnings and 
reprimands to any party that violates its commitments to execute 
these decisions. The Yemeni president also demanded that the 
members of the committee not be partial to any party. He called 
for the formation of a broad national front in order that no 
harm be brought to the country and its unity and in order to 
prevent breakdowns or security-related, political, or economic 
disturbances. AL-SHARQ has learned that the Yemeni president has 
declared his readiness to represent the GPC when dealing with an 
investigative committee concerned with the importation of 
prohibited weapons. The sources said that the Yemeni president 
set next Tuesday, 5 April, as the date for having Salim Salih, a 
member of the Presidential Council, come to attend the meeting 
of the Presidential Council set by the PFDC. If he does not 
attend, then the PFDC will issue a statement to the nation 
concerning the matter. The sources said that the Yemeni 
president guarantees protection for the leaders of the YSP if 
they wish to return to Sanaa, and the matter of security has 
prevented them from doing so. In addition to this, the YSP 
yesterday announced the return of 10 of its former leading 
members who had been removed from the ranks of the party after 
the bloody events of January 1986. All of these 10 leaders were 
supporters of 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, the former president of South 
Yemen.

  [Text] Sanaa--News Agencies--The YSP [Yemeni Socialist

in Sanaa yesterday. Salim Salih, Presidential Council member and 
YSP assistant secretary general, was scheduled to participate in 
the meeting. But political sources have said that Salim Salih 
has not gone to Sanaa. At a meeting in Aden two days ago, the 
Yemeni Council of Ministers decided to form a number of 
committees to implement provisions of the Document of Pledge and 
Accord. The council also decided to present a plan to arrest 
escaped suspects and prisoners. The work of these activities is 
connected with eliminating armed manifestations from the cities 
and returning military units to their positions. The work also 
includes drafting laws and regulations to codify relations and 
to define the powers and duties of the Presidential Council and 
of its president, vice president, and members in accordance with 
the Constitution. It further includes reviewing the Council of 
Ministers law and the Presidential Council bylaws. At an 
ordinary session held two days ago, the House of Representatives 
adopted a resolution mandating implementation of the Document of 
Pledge and Accord. 
  On the other hand, Yemeni tribesmen kidnaped three Dutch 
engineers last Friday and demanded rent in return for the 
utilization of their lands by oil companies operating in Yemen. 
Official sources have said that the "Jaham" tribe has detained 
the three Dutchmen in the Khawlan area, located 100 km east of 
Sanaa, the capital. The same tribe last year kidnapped a U.S. 
diplomat and then released him unharmed. The Netherlands Foreign 
Ministry has said that its embassy in Sanaa is working with the 
Yemeni authorities to secure the release of the three engineers.

  [Text] Last year Iran's economy put problems behind it 
while maintaining economic growth, and it had striking successes 
making structural adjustments. 
  Foreign pressures on the domestic economic system, the 
problems and difficulties created by American-led world 
imperialism, which sometimes became severe, the effects of the 
worldwide economic recession, especially in the economies of 
Europe and Japan and changes in the international markets, 
placed problems in the path of the nation's rapid economic 
development, but with the help of God and through the 
comprehensive and coordinated efforts of those working in the 
Islamic Republic's divine government, few bad effects were 
imposed on the nation's economy. 
  Of course, the effects from the reform of policies and 
programs on the nation's economy must not be overlooked, for 
these existed along with the problems beyond the nation's 
borders. Yet striking successes were achieved in the growth of 
the agricultural and industrial products, despite the fact that 
the relative stagnation of economic activities, the lack of 
clarity in the evaluation of investments in the nation's new 
economic conditions, and the lack of clarity of some laws having 
to do with investment, especially in the industrial free trade 
zones, cast a shadow over Iran's economic situation. 
  Last year the Islamic Republic of Iran was not spared the 
pressures of propaganda and baseless accusations from world 
imperialism, and in some cases, fighting tooth and nail against 
evil American-led imperialist propaganda required unceasing 
effort. 
  America's constant activity aimed at isolating the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and placing it in difficulties did not stop 
even for a moment. At the meetings of the leaders of the seven 
industrial nations in Geneva on 93 Tir 1372 [as published, 22 
June-22 July 1993], America once again asked the other nations 
present at the meeting, including Germany, France, Italy, Japan, 
Canada, and England to reduce their economic ties to Iran as 
much as possible and it accused Iran of supporting international 
terrorism. 
  These baseless accusations received a positive answer only 
through the extensive political efforts of those working in the 
government to retain the independent positions of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran's foreign policy. In reality, America was not 
able to achieve its goals, chief of which was to put Iran under 
economic pressure in order to dilute the principled and 
righteous positions of the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran towards international issues. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran is still considered the 
greatest 
power in the Persian Gulf area. It is a wealthy and independent 
nation in political activity in the strategic region of the 
Middle East, and the outlook for its reasonable economic growth 
and development is still hopeful. 
  Iran's economy during the last year can be studied from 
various perspectives. 
<H5>  Gross Domestic Product </H5>
  According to the preliminary estimates of the Plan and 
Budget 
Organization, the value of Iran's gross domestic product in the 
year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] at fixed prices based in 
the year 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] was 12,483 billion 
rials [R], which compared to the R11,715 billion fixed figure 
for the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] shows an 
increase of 6.5 percent. 
  The growth in Iran's gross domestic product was 3 percent in 
the year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990], 12.1 percent in the 
year 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991], 9.9 percent in the year 
1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] and 6.2 percent in the year 
1371. 
  Iran's average economic growth in the years 1368-1372 
implementing the First Five-Year Economic Development Plan 
reached 7.5 percent per year, which is close to the 8.1-percent 
figure set in the plan. 
  Although at the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan's 
implementation most Western experts said that the economic 
growth set in this plan would be impossible to achieve and that 
the goals were opportunistic, today the achievement of this 
growth is recognized by international experts as an undeniable 
success for the Islamic Republic of Iran. The small difference 
between the nation's real economic growth and the goal set in 
the plan is due to the failure to achieve growth in the oil, 
industry and construction sectors, especially in the years 1371 
and 1368, even though the growth in the water, electrical power, 
gas and transportation sectors was faster than expected under 
the plan. 
<H5>  Added Value of Economic Sectors </H5>
  In view of the new conditions for continuation of the policy 
of economic adjustment, in the year 1372 the unification of the 
foreign exchange rate and the application of the floating 
foreign exchange rate system, in view of the amount of currency 
in circulation, and the insufficient activity in the banking 
system in providing the needed means for the nation's economic 
units, especially in the first half of the year 1372, were among 
the factors in the slower growth of economic sectors. 
  According to statistics published by government sources, the 
growth in added value in the agricultural sector in the year 
1372 was 6.5 percent, it was 10.1 percent in the oil sector, 8.5 
percent in industry and mines, 17.8 percent in water, electrical 
power and natural gas, 4.8 percent in construction, 1.3 percent 
in transportation and shipping, and 15.5 percent in 
communications. The average growth in these sectors in the First 
Five-Year Plan was 6.1, 9.5, 15, 9.1, 14.5, and 5 percent, 
respectively. Growth in the communications sector under the plan 
was not announced. 
  The experience of the First Five-Year Plan has caused 
economic planners to pay more attention in writing the Second 
Five-Year Plan to capital resources in the nation's economy, 
international conditions, the oil market situation and 
unpredictable changes, and they have set a more reasonable 
economic growth target of 5.8 percent per year. 
  Most of the world's independent economic experts consider 
Iran's economic success in recent years, despite increasing 
foreign pressures on the country, to be a great success for 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani's government. 
  Of course, it is necessary to pay appropriate attention to 
the reasons for the failure to achieve all the goals. Most of 
those reasons originate abroad, and some of them are the result 
of domestic economic policy and behavior. 
<H5>  Government's Role in General Budget </H5>
  Despite the fact that in the 1372 budget the expected and 
approved deficit figure was zero, according to the latest 
estimates from the Plan and Budget Organization the general 
budget deficit in the year 1372 was R2,139 billion, an increase 
compared to the 1371 budget deficit of R1,077 billion. 
  The government's total expenses in the year 1372 were 
estimated at R21,823 billion, compared to revenues of R19,684 
billion. To a great extent the general budget deficit in the 
year 1372 was due to the failure to achieve oil revenues, 
because the tax revenues were greater than expected in all the 
years of the First Five-Year Plan. Even in the year 1371 the 
government's tax revenues were 45.4 percent greater than the 
figure projected in the Five-Year Plan. 
  Despite the economizing done by the government 
organizations, 
especially this year, and despite the economical payments and 
allocations done by the Plan and Budget Organization, general 
expenses increased. Some of this was due to changes in the 
foreign exchange rate and heavier expenses that the floating 
foreign exchange rate imposed on government applicants for 
foreign exchange. 
  The failure to achieve projected oil revenues in the First 
Five-Year Plan, mostly due to foreign factors and inappropriate 
behavior by international agents in this industry, caused the 
nation's economic officials and planners to act with greater 
caution and to set next year's oil revenues at above $10 billion 
in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, to reduce the 
negative effects of economic changes in the world's energy 
markets on the national economy, and this is considered one of 
the positive points in the planning of the nation's economy. 
<H5>  Imports and Exports </H5>
  The rapid growth in trade in the first years of Iran's First 
Five-Year Economic Development Plan led to the nation making 
foreign exchange commitments. Thus, since the beginning of the 
year 1372 [21 March 1993] the officials of the nation's economic 
system took a more conservative position on imports to reduce 
the trade imbalance and to be able to reduce the burden of 
foreign exchange commitments. 
  Iran's imports in the year 1372 decreased sharply from the 
year 1371, and according to estimates from unofficial sources it 
reached $13 billion. The Plan and Budget Organization estimated 
this figure at $16 billion. 
  In view of estimates from this organization that the value 
of 
oil exports in the year 1372 was $14.9 billion and that nonoil 
exports were valued at $3.26 billion, in the year 1372 there 
should be a trade surplus of about $2.16 billion for the year 
1372. However, unofficial sources, who have estimated Iran's 
nonoil exports at about $3.5 to $4 billion and sometimes more, 
say that Iran should have a trade surplus of about $3.5 billion 
in the year 1372. In view of the fact that Iran had a trade 
deficit of more than $5 billion in the year 1371, this is 
considered a great success for Iran. 
  Although the trade surplus was due to the increase in nonoil 
exports and restrictions on imports, it was necessary to apply 
the floating foreign exchange rate, which is to some extent 
responsible for imports costing more and making exports more 
profitable, and on the other hand reducing imports has suspended 
or slowed implementation of some economic projects, and this has 
made it difficult to make full use of economic capacities due to 
the shortage of monetary resources to obtain the needed raw 
materials in time. 
  It is clear, however, that economizing on imports, in view 
of 
the nation's limited foreign exchange resources, was a positive 
and necessary step in the view of most economic experts. 
  Iran's foreign exchange commitments against usance purchases 
have increased in recent years, and repayments on these 
commitments have been deferred to the last year of the First 
Five-Year Plan and the years of the Second Five-Year Plan. This 
has made it necessary to economize on foreign exchange 
expenditures. 
  Among Iran's other economic successes in the view of the 
experts are the infrastructure and essential investments that 
have been made in the First Five-Year Plan, which have created 
conditions allowing for growth in domestic production and 
reduced demand for imports to achieve society's essential needs. 
For example, in recent years Iran was a major importer of steel, 
cement and wheat. 
  In the year 1372, not only did steel and cement imports 
stop, 
but Iran began exporting steel to the world's markets with rapid 
growth. Demand for wheat imports also decreased significantly 
this year, and this was due to increased domestic production. 
  On the other hand, preparations for increased nonoil exports 
were made under the First Five-Year Plan. The value of Iran's 
nonoil exports this year is more than $3 billion. The estimate 
by the Plan and Budget Organization shows a figure close to $3.2 
billion, but insiders in trade affairs believe that including 
the smuggling of goods outside the country and in view of the 
continued low customs rates for export goods, the value of 
Iran's nonoil exports this year is even greater than $4 billion. 
This group believes that with the growth in the quality and 
quantity of the nation's production, the development of 
industrial exports, Iran's active involvements in marketing, 
international expositions and markets, and better packaging, it 
will be easy to more than double Iran's nonoil exports during 
five years to $10 billion and to increase the role of nonoil 
exports in meeting expenses to more than 50 percent. In the year 
1372 this figure was about 25 percent, yet before implementation 
of the First Five-Year Economic Development Plan that figure was 
less than 10 percent. 
<H5>  Foreign Exchange Market Fluctuations </H5>
  Despite the implementation of the floating foreign exchange 
rate system and the sale of dollars by the Central Bank of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and the banking system, since late in 
the month of Farvardin 1372 [21 March-20 April 1993], there were 
two successive periods of severe fluctuations in the foreign 
exchange market, which ultimately led to the dollar increasing 
in value against the rial. From Farvardin 1372 until prior to 
the announcement of the sale of travel and commercial foreign 
exchange at the floating rate by the banking system, the value 
of the dollar increased to R1,850, yet at the same time the 
floating foreign exchange rate was less than R1,500. In the 
first phase the Central Bank raised the value of the dollar 
against the rial to about R1,750. 
  In the first fluctuation of the foreign exchange market the 
value of the dollar increased again against the rial, and on the 
free market the price of a dollar reached R2,800 under the 
pressure of the demand for and short supply of foreign exchange. 
Among the main reasons for that were the activities of foreign 
exchange speculators in fanning the flames of market change. 
<H5>  Foreign Exchange Commitments </H5>
  Iran's major problem in the year 1372 was the suspension of 
the country's foreign exchange commitments. According to reports 
from official sources, by the end of this year the nation's 
total of unpaid foreign exchange commitments reached $12 
billion. Under the effects of this problem, it was difficult for 
Iran to open credit documents in the foreign banking system and 
most of Iran's transactions were done in cash drafts, which 
proceeded slowly. 
  The banking system's low sales of foreign exchange also 
caused many who were seeking foreign exchange to turn to the 
free market, and increased demand on this market. In view of the 
short supply of dollars and the speculative activities of 
brokers, this caused the rial to weaken against the dollar. 
  Iran's efforts to renegotiate the timetables for its foreign 
exchange commitments late in the year 1372 bore fruit, and this 
was considered one of the great successes of Iran's economic 
policymakers. Successes were achieved with German creditors in 
rescheduling 4.5 billion marks of Iran's foreign exchange 
commitments, and with Japanese creditors in rescheduling about 
$800 billion in suspended commitments to Japanese companies. 
These successes paved the way for Iran to open credit documents 
and to procure the foreign exchange needed normally through the 
banking system. It is expected that in the near future this 
process will proceed with sufficient smoothness and will show a 
positive effect on the free foreign exchange market. For the 
first time in recent years the Central Bank did not seek to 
strengthen the value of the dollar and during the foreign 
exchange rate fluctuations in the first part of the month of 
Esfand this year [20 February-19 March] it did not lower the 
value of the rial. 
<H5>  Volume of Currency in Circulation </H5>
  In view of this, the government's budget deficit helped with 
the growth in currency in circulation in the country. The First 
Five-Year Plan, which had the goal of achieving economic balance 
by controlling the growth of currency in circulation by reducing 
the government's budget deficit to zero, was in practice faced 
with increased demand for cash. 
  The volume of currency in circulation in the year 1370 
reached R28,628 billion, based on the estimate from the Plan and 
Budget Organization. In the year 1371 this figure reached 
R35,799 billion. It is likely that in the year 1372 this figure 
will reach more than R40,000 billion or a maximum of R47,691.5 
billion, an increase of 33.2 percent compared to the year 1371. 
<H5>  Rate of Inflation Growth </H5>
  This rapid growth has intensified inflationary pressures. 
The 
indicator of prices for consumer goods and services with a base 
year of 1361 as 100, reached R421.9 in the year 1370 and in the 
year 1371 it reached R513.2. In the year 1372 this figure is 
expected to reach R667.3. Thus inflation in the year 1372 is 
estimated at 30 percent, which is more than the 21.6 percent 
registered for the year 1371. 
  Although the government is trying to guide currency in 
circulation into productive channels and positive economic 
activities by selling the shares of the producing units under 
its control on the Tehran stock market or through auctions and 
negotiations, providing various services with new tariffs, 
increasing tax rates, especially in the customs sector, changing 
the consumption model, encouraging investment in the producing 
sectors and other things, there is still a hot market for 
speculation in gold, foreign exchange and other profitable 
materials in the trade and services sector and it is attracting 
some of the currency in circulation. 
  By increasing the profit rates it pays on deposits, 
especially fixed-term deposits and providing various financial 
services, Iran's banking system is trying to guide the currency 
in circulation in the private sector into the banking system. 
However, the difference between the profit rate for bank 
deposits and the enormous profits for speculative transactions 
has kept this goal from being completely achieved. Despite this, 
existing statistics testify to the increased volume of bank 
deposits. 
  In the first half of the year 1372 the government took steps 
through the banking system to control the flow of currency in 
circulation. Although the implementation of the floating foreign 
exchange rate system and increasing the foreign exchange rate 
for that group of producing units that had used preferred 
government and competitive foreign exchange rates before the 
year 1371 increased the demand for currency in circulation to 
procure the foreign exchange needed, in the first half of the 
year the banking system adopted a more restricted policy for 
granting credits, which serves to control the growth in the 
government's currency in circulation. However, at the insistence 
of economic agents, who were making less use of production 
capacity because of the shortage of currency in circulation to 
procure raw materials, the banking system changed this course, 
and in the second half of the year 1372 more credits were 
granted. This was followed by growth in currency in circulation, 
and the inflationary pressures were pronounced. 
  Thus Iran's economy, through great effort, forbearance and 
solving problems, during the year 1372 continued moving towards 
a market and pricing system and the government made greater 
efforts to expand private sector activities and to transfer to 
the private sector some executive and practical 
responsibilities, especially in the production sectors. 
<H5>  Oil Market </H5>
  More than 80 percent of Iran's foreign exchange revenues 
come 
from the export of oil, and the nation's economy is sensitive to 
world oil market conditions. Last year the situation in the oil 
market was the worst it has been in five years. The price of oil 
decreased more than 25 percent and, like it or not, it affected 
Iran's economy. 
  Although the nation's economy was not able to obtain the 
projected revenues of $16.8 billion from oil sales in 1372 and 
the weakness of the market caused oil revenues to drop below $14 
billion, various factors influenced this situation, and despite 
Iran's efforts in OPEC to overcome the malfunctioning situation 
in the oil market, they made the market situation worse day 
after day. 
  The rapid increase in the production of oil in the non-OPEC 
nations, especially Norway and England in the North Sea; the 
growth in oil sales by Russia to Western markets to obtain more 
reliable foreign exchange revenues; the growth in oil production 
in other non-OPEC nations; the continued economic stagnation in 
Western Europe and Japan, which led to reduced demand for oil; 
efforts and collusion by the big oil producers to keep oil 
prices down on the world market, and other things all affected 
the world oil market situation in the year 1372. 
  Despite this, Iran's efforts at the September 1993 OPEC 
meeting of oil ministers in Geneva were especially important, 
because if these efforts had not borne fruit and if the OPEC 
members had not tried to control the marketing of oil, even 
greater decreases in oil prices would have been inevitable. The 
oil market, which was severely weakened and in disarray after 
the summer of 1372, was offering more than 1 million barrels a 
day [BPD] because of reduced demand and excess marketing, mostly 
by the independent producers. 
  The efforts of the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
to contact Fahd, the king of Saudi Arabia, to put the oil market 
in order, was among the effective steps bringing OPEC members to 
an agreement to keep production down to 24.58 million BPD in the 
first half of the year 1993 and the first three months of the 
year 1994, and it prevented a further drop in oil prices, 
although the non-OPEC producers responded irresponsibly. 
  Despite this, OPEC continues to work to gain the support of 
non-OPEC producers through reduced production, although some 
independent producers insist on continuing to produce at high 
levels, and in reality the have created a disappointing outlook 
for the oil market by working with the world's other dominant 
powers. 
  Consequently, this undesirable situation has caused most 
OPEC 
members, including Iran, to review their economic development 
programs and the implementation of their national projects and 
expenditures to keep this process from having undesirable 
effects on their economies to the extent possible. 
  Although Iran's oil production capacity reached more than 4 
million barrels in the year 1372, its true production level was 
kept at 3.8 million BPD, and the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
kept its commitment to OPEC decisions on oil production quotas. 
  Despite more limited revenues from oil sales than those 
projected for the year 1372, oil and gas projects still have 
priority and are being pursued. Many projects in the oil and gas 
sectors were completed. Production capacity increased and more 
wells were drilled in the Persian Gulf and in the Caspian Sea. 
The capacity of the oil refineries increased with the 
reconstruction of the Abadan refinery and the establishment of 
the Arak refinery. Natural gas delivery projects to 150 of the 
nation's cities continued, and the Esfahan motor oil project, 
the Arak petrochemical project, and others went into operation. 
  The year 1372 was the final year of implementation of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's First Five-Year Economic, Social and 
Cultural Development Plan. Despite the effective and 
comprehensive advances in the oil industry, which were made 
through extensive investment and persistent effort by those 
working in this industry, the revenues projected in the 
Five-Year Plan were not achieved. In the year 1372 Iran's 
revenues from oil sales were to have reached $16.8 billion, yet 
according to the latest estimate by the Plan and Budget 
Organization these revenues were $14.9 billion, based on daily 
exports of 2.545 million barrels of oil at an average price of 
$14 per barrel. Independent economic experts put Iran's revenues 
from the sale of oil at about $13 billion.

was emphasized under the First Five-Year Plan was turning 
affairs over to the people, privatization, and reducing 
government expenses. Unfortunately, implementing this policy was 
not successful in the year 1372. A selection of reports on the 
government's policy, the efforts made and the existing obstacles 
can well illustrate this conclusion. 
  Ninety percent of distribution activities were turned over 
to 
the private sector. 
  Economic liberalization was considered a focus of government 
activity. 
  Minister of Commerce, 1/30/1372 [19 April 1993] 
  The government, in turning work over to the people, must 
avoid trivial executive problems.

to expedite the transfer of units to the private sector. 
  Stock Market Council, 5/16/1372 
  The minister of heavy industries criticized the way the 
government organizations are dealing with private sector 
investors. 
  6/9/1372 [31 August 1993] 
  The petrochemical industry can develop only via the private 
sector. 
  Executive Director of Petrochemicals 6/21/1372 [12 
September 1993] 
  In the year 1373 the shares of 60 companies under the 
National Industries Organization were turned over to the people. 
  8/17/1372 [8 November 1993] 
  The nation's economic structure has prevented turning 
affairs 
over to the people.

  [Text] Economics Division. Agriculture is considered one of 
the main, indeed one of the most basic foundations of the 
nation's economy. Freedom from food dependence depends on 
achieving self-sufficiency in the agricultural sector. 
  In view of Imam Khomeyni's (peace be upon him) special 
concern and the exalted leader's special concern for focusing on 
agriculture in the nation's economic development, its importance 
is plainly evident. 
  In general, this year the agricultural sector had a year of 
crisis in production. An example is the sudden increase in the 
price of essential agricultural supplies, meaning the 
multiplication several times of the price of fertilizer and 
chemical pesticides due to the unification of the foreign 
exchange rate. One of the most important successes in the 
agricultural sector in the year 1372 was the production of about 
11 million tons of wheat. Printed below are some of the most 
important developments and issues in the agricultural sector 
during the year 1372. 
  Nineteen percent of bank credits are given to farmers. 
  1/16/1372 [5 April 1993] 
  Policies announcing the transfer of livestock to the private 
sector were announced. 
  2/5/1372 [25 April 1993] 
  With the elimination of milk subsidies, the price of a 
half-liter increased to R200. 
  2/9/1372 [28 April 1993] 
  Subsidies on fertilizers and pesticides reinstated after 
being eliminated. 
  2/12/1372 [2 May 1993] 
  To revitalize and develop agricultural lands, the Land Bank 
is being established. 
  3/5/1372 [26 May 1993] 
  Iran takes first place among the world's date exporters. 
  Every year enough food to feed 15 million people is wasted 
in 
Iran. 
  5/2/1372 [24 July 1993] 
  Imports of rice, vegetable shortening, and meat is 
deregulated if done without transferring foreign exchange. 
  5/14/1372 [5 August 1993] 
  Eighty percent of the agricultural crops to be included in 
guaranteed purchase project. 
  6/13/1372 [4 September 1993] 
  The Central Bank did not provide the credits to make 
guaranteed purchases of grain in time. 
  7/8/1372 [30 September 1993] 
  Every year $200 million in foreign exchange is spent 
importing meat. 
  7/21/1372 [13 October 1993] 
  Nation's wheat production exceeds 10 million tons. 
  10/14/1372 [4 January 1994] 
  Deeds for more than 850,000 hectares of pastures given to 
livestock keepers. 
  10/23/1372 [13 January 1994] 
  Meat production in the country increases to 645,000 tons. 
  11/18/1372 [7 February 1994] 
  1.5 million tons of wheat infected with yellow rust disease. 
  11/19/1372 [8 February 1994]

  [Text] Economics Division. As the final year of the First 
Five-Year Development Plan, the year 1372 was especially 
important, because the dear and toiling people of our country 
saw in practice some of the fruits of the economic pressures 
caused by this plan, which they have endured in recent years. 
The start-up and utilization of 40 important projects in various 
areas of water, electrical power, roads, agriculture, industry 
and mines costing millions of rials and dollars brought the good 
news that if we tighten our belts, we will travel the path to 
economic growth and development more quickly. Below we will look 
at the nation's most important projects that went into operation 
in the year 1372. 
  The most important projects put into operation during the 
year 1372 include the opening of the first factory extracting 
Iran's gold in Muteh, operation of Phase 1 of the Arak 
Petrochemical Plant, the opening of the Saveh reservoir dam, 
operation of the first solar electrical power production unit by 
the Atomic Energy Organization, the construction of the first 
six-cylinder gasoline motor by the Revolution Guard 
Self-Sufficiency Crusade Organization, operation of the first 
heavy tractor production line in Tabriz and its assembly in 
Jiroft, the production of the first urban bus in accordance with 
international standards, full operation of Phase 1 of the Martyr 
Raja'i Power Plant, beginning of operation of the Zayandehrud 
River Water Transfer Project, operation of the nation's largest 
fire brick factory, the beginning of construction of the Tanzimi 
Dam, the most modern license-plate-producing unit, the opening 
of the seven-lane Fajr Bridge in Tehran, and the multilevel 
bridge at Karaj.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The large Arak petrochemical project is one of the fruits of 
the victory of the magnificent Islamic revolution led by Imam 
Khomeyni and the sacred blood of the precious martyrs of Islam, 
and is the result of the round-the-clock efforts of the experts 
of the National Petrochemical Industries, particularly Arak 
Petrochemical Company. 
  In the vast country of Iran, the abundant potential in the 
industrial, agricultural, developmental, and cultural sectors 
provides very good conditions for investment in the 
petrochemical industry. In addition, the existence of vast raw 
material resources, a market for absorbing the products 
domestically and abroad, the prospects of the production of an 
extensive spectrum of products, and finally high technical and 
economic value are among the important incentives in the 
development of this industry. 
  For this reason, the petrochemical industry is especially 
important to the overall economic, social, and cultural 
development of the country. 
  In connection with the general policies for the development 
of this industry and related industries, and in harmony with the 
economic and social goals of the First Five-Year Plan, the Arak 
Petrochemical Complex is in the final stages of completion and 
becoming operational. 
  The operation of this large complex will mark a new chapter 
in the industrial self-sufficiency and independence of the 
country. This complex will make possibile the production of a 
vast spectrum of petrochemical and chemical products, which are 
very critical technically, economically, and even strategically. 
  The creation of this complex, which will convert raw 
petroleum materials into useful materials and is the main source 
for a great variety of petrochemical products, is a pivotal 
point in this industry. 
  We congratulate the grand leader of the Islamic revolution, 
the honorable president, the committed Muslim employees of the 
Ministry of Petroleum, and the Muslim and martyr-nurturing 
people of Iran for the important victory of Islamic Iran in 
joining the ranks of those who possess the main segment of the 
petroleum industry. 
<H5>  Brief History </H5>
  This project to create Arak Petrochemical has been discussed 
from 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] on the basis of plans by 
the National Petrochemical Industries Company to make suitable 
use of the existing raw materials in Iran, achieve 
self-sufficiency, meet the increasing demands of the domestic 
market, and ultimately replace the export of crude oil with the 
export of petrochemical products. It was placed at the top of 
the programs of the National Petrochemical Industries Company. 
Initial studies concerning this project began in 1362 [21 March 
1983-20 March 1984], and it was ratified by the Supreme Economic 
Council in 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985]. After a great 
deal of effort, in Azar 1364 [22 November-21 December 1985], the 
first line of credit was opened for the design and engineering 
of the Alfin Unit, which is the heart of the complex. 
Subsequently, agreements were signed for the design, 
engineering, and purchasing of machinery for other units. The 
task of industrial construction and installation began in 1368 
[21 March 1989-20 March 1990]. 
  In order to strengthen the financial sources for the project 
and encourage the people to participate as much as possible in 
investment in production, while the designing and engineering of 
the processing units were under way, on 19/01/1366 [8 April 
1987], the Arak Petrochemical Company was established, with the 
participation of the National Petrochemical Industries Company, 
with 51 percent of the shares, and the Melli Bank of Iran, with 
49 percent of the shares. The administration of the project 
through its final stages and up to full operation was conferred 
on this company. 
  With the efforts and joint support of the National 
Petrochemical Industries Company and the Melli Bank of Iran, and 
the round-the-clock efforts of the employees, by the grace of 
God, in the second half of 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], 
operation of the water, electricity, and steam units of the 
complex began and, subsequently, other service units and the 
olefin and polyolefin production units reached operation, and we 
are now witnessing its official inauguration. 
<H5>  Geographical Situation </H5>
  The Arak Petrochemical Complex is located next to the 
Seventh 
Refinery, at Km 22 on the Arak-Borujerd road, at an elevation of 
1,888 [meters] above sea level. Initially, 523 hectares [ha] of 
land were obtained to create the processing units, the service 
units, and the general and primary facilities. For the 
developmental projects and for facilitating access to the road 
for the loading and unloading of the raw materials and products 
of the complex, 215 ha west of the complex are being acquired. 
  The main factor in the choice of location is its proximity 
to 
the refinery (the main supplier of the complex); access to the 
network of roads, railroads, and the main natural gas pipeline; 
and its nearness to the consumer centers for [distribution of] 
the products. 
<H5>  The Units of the Complex </H5>
  The Arak Petrochemical Complex consists of 14 processing 
units, six secondary service units, 14 general facilities, and 
integral and general building sections, as described in Chart 
No. 1.

  These facilities are designed for the establishment of 
contact between the processing units and the auxiliary services 
and for providing the common needs of the units of the entire 
complex, which include 14 untreated water and supply systems of 
the complex, a fire department, natural gas fuel, liquid fuel, 
the collection of excess water and refining of waste water, 
electricity distribution, a communications network with 1,600 
telephones, 140 km of pipelines between units, areas for 
chemical storage, areas for hydrogen storage, a system for the 
collection of water from condensation, and the torch system [as 
published] of the complex. 
<H5>  D. General Buildings and Ground Work </H5>
  Since the start of the implementation operations of the 
complex, ground work and the construction of general buildings 
have been carried out in the form of dozens of large and small 
projects by Iranian contractors or in the form of direct 
government management. The designing and engineering of these 
projects have been carried out by or under the supervision of 
the Engineering Affairs of the Arak Petrochemical Company. Their 
implementation has come under the supervision of the Unit for 
Overseeing Civic and Ground Work and involves a central 
workshop, with full equipment for the technical service 
buildings; a central laboratory; a central office; a restaurant; 
a prayer hall; four product unit warehouses, which consist of 
52,000 square meters; 10 covered warehouses, with 38,000 square 
meters under construction; a fire department; a plastic bag 
production unit; a 58-unit guest house inside the complex; 57 
three-bedroom residential units; an industrial treatment center; 
a Melli Bank building; a gasoline station; 40 km of roads inside 
the complex; the widening of the Arak-Shahr-e Mohajeran road; 
and putting up a 10-km-long fence around the complex. 
<H5>  Raw Materials for the Complex </H5>
  The main supply for the complex is light and heavy naphtha, 
which will be delivered from the Esfahan and Arak refineries via 
pipelines to the complex. 
  At the present time, the major portion of the naphtha supply 
is transported to the complex in tankers from Esfahan. 
  Natural gas is needed in the complex, both as a raw material 
in the processing units and as a fuel, and is received via the 
main natural gas pipeline that passes near the complex and is 
sent through the distribution system to various consumer points. 
  Untreated water needed in the complex is provided from 
underground reservoirs and from nine wells. 
  Ammonia needed in the complex is procured at the level of 
6,000 tons annually from the Shiraz Petrochemical Complex. 
<H5>  General Characteristics of the Project </H5>
  In addition to the fact that the most advanced technologies 
and processing methods will be used in the Arak Petrochemical 
Complex and the highest standards of design have been used in 
it, this project has distinct characteristics, which are the 
result of the latest scientific, technical, and safety 
innovations and experiences and make the Arak Petrochemical 
Complex a unique and advanced complex compared to similar 
complexes in the most advanced countries in the world. 
<H5>  The General Characteristics of the Complex Are as Follows </H5>
  Most of the units of the complex use very advanced precision 
control systems and instruments, called DCS (Distributed Control 
System), which are computerized, and every unit has an 
independent control room and a separate computerized control 
system. Also, in this complex, there are 59 PLCs (Programable 
Logic Controls). In other words, in terms of control, it is one 
of the most advanced systems. 
  Very strong, resistant reinforced concrete is used for the 
passive defense of the whole complex. This concrete is more 
complicated, both in terms of design and construction, than that 
used in mixed metal and concrete structures. 
  Connecting the units is a system of underground concrete 
canals, which in terms of passive defense and also in terms of 
repairs and aesthetics are very efficient. 
  In terms of the complexity of the work in the complex, the 
changes in temperature can be considered significant. In the 
Arak Petrochemical Complex, the temperature changes from -190 
degrees C. to 1,650 degrees C. For this reason, it requires 
various materials with various properties and also requires a 
very precise control system. The pressure changes in the complex 
range from 120 times to vacuum [as published]. 
  In terms of the general layout, the complex is very 
aesthetically designed. The access and main roads are of very 
modern design and are arranged in the form of boulevards. 
  The very advanced industrial waste water refinery will 
generate a minimal amount of pollution. The processed water is 
returned to the cooling towers, and some of it is used for the 
irrigation of the green areas. In regards to the green areas, in 
the northern section of the complex, a large number of trees 
have been planted and are growing well. 
  The complex has one of the most well-equipped stationary and 
mobile fire extinguishing systems. 
<H5>  Method for the Implementation of the Project </H5>
  After the completion of comprehensive marketing studies, in 
order to determine the spectrum and capacity of needed products 
and complete the technical and economic feasibility studies for 
the plan, the need for the clarification of an implementation 
plan for various stages of the project suitable to the mottos 
and gains of the magnificent Islamic revolution was noted. In 
this connection, minimum dependence on foreign countries and 
maximum use of committed Iranian experts and the implementation 
of the task at high quality and low cost were given the most 
prominence. The choice of licenses, the basic engineering and 
detail work, and the purchasing of goods from abroad under the 
supervision of petrochemical experts was carried out so that 14 
advanced technical licenses and six first-rate technological 
licenses were obtained for the processing and auxiliary service 
units, respectively. 
  Agreements were signed with about 15 reputable international 
companies to obtain licenses, develop designs, provide 
engineers, and purchase machinery. 
  In all agreements, the preservation of the maximum interests 
of the company and the maximum transfer of technology have been 
included. 
  Iranian experts have been overseeing all design, 
engineering, 
and purchasing phases. In this regard, these experts have gained 
valuable experience. 
  The right of arbitration is given to Iranian courts. 
  The right for Iran to create similar units has been 
safeguarded. 
  The guarantee to provide spare parts for a period of 10 
years 
is conferred on the contractor. 
  The training of Iranian personnel in similar units of the 
contractors has been included in order to ensure readiness for 
operation. 
  To guarantee the design and quality of manufacture and the 
dependable operation of the equipment sold, the design 
contractors and manufacturing companies or sellers of the 
equipment are responsible to supervise the installation and 
start of operations. 
  The standards and technical specifications needed have been 
drawn up, and the contractor is obliged to observe them for 
purposes of coordination. 
  All the purchased equipment weighs 150,000 tons. 
  The technical inspection of the equipment during 
manufacturing and delivery was carried out by Iranian experts. 
  In special cases, the guarantee for long-term procurement 
catalysts were obtained. 
  Access to advanced technology by those who offer it is 
included for the long term. 
<H5>  Installation and Construction </H5>
  To complete the installation and construction of the 
complex, 
it was decided to grant the construction of six production units 
and all the auxiliary service units in addition to the general 
and common facilities to foreign contractors. To implement this 
decision, after a study was made of reputable international 
companies, a short list of those companies that were able to do 
this work was prepared, and the bid of the Italian company, 
Filippo Fuki, was accepted, and an agreement was signed. This 
company was required to use 70 percent of its labor force from 
the domestic work force, but in practice, 85 percent of its work 
force has been comprised of domestic workers. In this regard, 
fortunately, beneficial practical training was carried out. In 
terms of acquiring skill and technology transfer, Iranians have 
benefitted significantly in various phases of the installation. 
  In addition to those individuals employed directly by the 
Fuki Company, a large number of domestic contractors also signed 
contracts with the above-mentioned company and have been active 
in the construction of the complex. A list of the contractors is 
included in Chart No. 2. 
  In addition to the plans to make maximum use of the Iranian 
work force, the decision was made to make use of the resources 
of large contracting companies in Iran, to which end the 
installation of five production units and some of the work of 
auxiliary service units and general and common facilities also 
were conferred on domestic contractors. In this connection, the 
Tehran Jonub, Namgan, and Ramsaz Companies have had the greatest 
share. As the work progressed, the contract with the Tehran 
Jonub Company was terminated; other companies replaced it; and 
work continued under the direct management of the Arak 
Petrochemical Company. 
  All the general work and construction has been conferred on 
domestic contractors or carried out by the government under the 
direct supervision of the Arak Petrochemical Company. In this 
regard, about 350 large and small Iranian companies have been 
used. 
  The designing of all offices and auxiliary buildings of the 
complex, such the central workshop, the central laboratory, the 
warehouses, the technical service buildings, and so on, has been 
done by the personnel of the Arak Petrochemical Company. 
  In order to reduce foreign currency expenditures, in the 
course of the project, some of the work with foreign contractors 
has been cancelled and conferred on Iranian contractors. In 
total, at the height of the work on this complex, the work force 
consisted of 13,000 persons, 1,000 of them foreigners and 12,000 
Iranians. 
<H5>  Start-Up and Operation </H5>
  The start-up and operation of this complex has been handled 
totally by the personnel of the Arak Petrochemical Company. The 
presence of a minimum number of representatives of the owner of 
the license and the designing contractor alongside the operating 
personnel has been projected to carry out the guarantee of the 
operators, as reflected in the contract. 
  In keeping with the progress of the installation work, 
operation personnel were hired, and the related organization was 
prepared. 
  The safe and uneventful start-up of the processing and 
service units of this large complex, including the very 
sensitive olefin unit, at the hands of domestic forces who have 
had no experience in this area is a proud golden leaf in the 
petrochemical industry and the entire country. 
  The operational personnel have acquired the necessary 
training in several phases. 
<H5>  The Financial Status of the Project </H5>
<H5>  A. Investment </H5>
  Investments in this project are as follows: 

  -  Cash investments, 300 billion rials [R] 
  -  Funds from the Melli Bank, R200 billion 
  -  International funds from the National Petrochemical 
Industries 
Company, R740 billion 
  -  Needed through banking funds or the sale of material, R260 
billion 
  -  Total, R1500 billion 
  -  Of this amount, about $2 billion has been in foreign currency 
and the remainder in rials 

<H5>  B. Economic Return </H5>
  On the whole, investments in petrochemical industries have a 
high rate of return. In this complex, as well, calculating the 
price of the import sales in recent years and the actual foreign 
currency rate, calculating the international price for supplies 
and consumption, the economic indicators are summarized as 
follows: 

  -  Level of sales (with 100 percent production), R554 billion 
  -  Level of profit, R186 billion 
  -  Ratio of profit to cash investment, 66 percent 
  -  Ratio of profit to total investment, 13 percent 
  -  Rate of domestic return, 32 percent 

<H5>  C. Important Gains of the Implementation of the Project </H5>
  Foreign currency conservation. 
  The creation of jobs. 
  The training and transfer of technology, self-sufficiency, 
and economic independence. 
  The added value and growth of national revenues.

familiarize them with the units that have been installed in the 
complex, 182 persons and 490 persons [per] month [as published]. 

<H5>  Housing Manufacturing Projects </H5>
  The Arak Petrochemical Company, in conformity with the 
policy 
of the Ministry of Petroleum and the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and in order to reduce the pressures of housing 
demands and also to provide relative comfort and absorption of 
expert forces, is preparing a large employee housing 
construction project. In this connection, 18 apartment units and 
a complex of 120 unfinished apartments were purchased from the 
Ministry of Housing and Urban Development in the city of Arak

gypsum, 170,000 tons of mineral coke, and 6,000 tons of blue 
salt will be mined. 
  Of the active mines in the province of Kordestan, 24 are in 
Qarveh, 20 are in Sanandaj, and the rest are in the rest of the 
cities of this province. 
  According to Behruz Asudi, general manager of mines and 
metals for the province of Kordestan, by the end of this year 10 
of this province's inactive mines will be reactivated, and by 
the middle of next year [23 September 1994], the other 12 will 
be recovered. 
  He said that of the 72 mines in this province, 71 were 
transferred to the private sector in recent years, thereby 
creating employment for 1,200 people. 
  The mines in the province of Kordestan have been equipped 
with advanced rock-cutting equipment and talc producing units 
have been built. 
  Among the factors making the mining sector in the province 
of 
Kordestan prosperous, making the region's economy flourish and 
increasing employment opportunities and the incomes of the 
public in this province are attracting investment from the 
private sector, familiarizing capital owners with this sector's 
activities, increasing the credits in Notes 3 and 25 and 
creating mining cooperatives and public corporations.

  [Text] Authorities in the Republic of Azerbaijan 
discontinued the Azeri program of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
broadcast from Baku TV under the pretext of reducing 
broadcasting hours because of insufficient electric power. 
  The deputy director of Baku State Radio and TV, Nahid Hajif, 
offered the above reason for terminating the program and hoped 
that the broadcast of the program would resume in the near 
future. 
  He added that in view of the power shortage in Azerbaijan, 
Baku TV began to reduce its broadcasting hours two weeks ago. 
For the same reason, he said, the one-hour TV program of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran in Azeri will be terminated. 
  As the Iranian Azeri program was terminated from Channel 1 
of 
Baku TV, the BMTI channel of the network began to relay the 
English super channel programs. 
  The one-hour Iranian TV program in Azeri started 
broadcasting 
from Baku TV early this year; it had a large audience. An 
informed source from the Iranian Embassy in Baku said that the 
issue of the termination of the Iranian TV program is under 
investigation. 
  Diplomatic sources believe that the measure was taken in 
view 
of the recent moves by Moscow to diminish the Iranian role and 
presence in Central Asia.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Nasrullah Khan: "What Is Happening?] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South 
Asian Affair Ms. Raphel or rifle [as published, preceding word 
in English] has openly told us, "Hey people! Open your ears and 
listen to me. The United States considers Kashmir a disputed 
region and we have said that the oneness of Kashmir will not be 
affected. In other words Kashmir will not be divided." When the 
U.S. assistant secretary visited Delhi, she was greeted with 
black flags. The fundamentalist Indian Hindus believed that she 
was trying to stop the brutalities that the Indian military was 
committing on the Muslims in Kashmir. How could Kashmir be 
India's integral part if this happened? However, later when Mr. 
Rao and some important cabinet members talked with Madam Raphel 
or rifle, she openly said that she will stop the terrorists from 
terrorist activities in Kashmir to resolve this issue and that 
Pakistan will not be allowed to provide help to them. Thus, 
Madam Raphel has said these things, and now the deputy secretary 
of state is also coming to India, or has arrived there before my 
column is published, to make India happier and charm it further. 
Some people say that this victory does not belong to the 
government of India but to the black flags behind which India, 
the Indian government, and Kashmir could not be seen. Also, 
showing black flags makes white people's color paler and perhaps 
the Indian government had paraded these black flags as part of 
its diplomatic effort. Madam Raphel had to say that the freedom 
fighters are also violating human rights. In other words, it is 
not the Indian army alone that is violating human rights. 
Justice demanded that Madam Raphel should say that India should 
recall its military from Kashmir. What right did the Indian 
military have to be in Kashmir after the United States declared 
it a disputed region? Will the Kashmiri freedom fighters squash 
their heads by hitting them on the wall if the Indian army 
leaves? Madam Raphel said in an interview with Doordarshan that 
Kashmir cannot be considered an integral part of India forever. 
However, showing her black flags was like showing a red flag to 
a bull in a bullfight. The United States was like a bull in the 
past and the former Soviet Union was like a red flag. Madam 
Raphel also said that she had made it clear to Pakistan that the 
United States will be unhappy with its providing assistance to 
the "separatists" or the freedom fighters. Pakistan really 
stopped giving help to the Kashmiri freedom fighters. It means 
that if any aid is to be given, it must be given to the Indian 
military, and the United States will provide it if needed. It 
does not want to make India, which is a large country, unhappy 
at all. Later, it will want Pakistan also to become an integral 
part of India. Mr. Qazi of Jamaat-i-Islami and other religious 
parties know that jihad should be called on Kashmir. By this 
jihad they mean to provide economic aid to Kashmiri freedom 
fighters. They have collected 20 million rupees for this 
purpose. Do they think that they will ask their elected 
government to give this money? Since the United States has its 
word that it will stop giving assistance to the freedom fighters 
in Kashmir, will these parties provide this assistance to 
Kashmiris on their own? They cannot make their elected 
government do what they want and are not able to send these 
money on their own. Therefore, our advise is to start a jihad in 
Kashmir and the United States! Perhaps, the United States will 
help them in this jihad. The situation in Kashmir now is such 
and that United States is supporting India so much that it is 
proper for Madam [Bhutto] and her cabinet members to say that 
this situation is not the kind that we can let the United States 
or India lead us by our noses. Therefore, the government should 
take the opposition in confidence at this critical point and 
make a decision so that India and the United States cannot 
interfere in Pakistan's autonomy. If the Kashmir issue is not 
resolved according to the wishes of Kashmiri people, the United 
States and India will succeed in making Pakistan an integral 
part of India or dividing it up in several parts. This is the 
time to be brave and courageous and to tell the United States 
bluntly that we have had agreements with you in the past and 
have suffered your friendship. You were involved in dividing 
Pakistan into two countries also. We are not going to take 
"dictation" from some major power because Pakistan is an 
independent nation. Therefore, if you think that we will present 
Kashmir to India in a silver platter because we are afraid of 
you, then it is your vain imagination. If you continue to insist 
on our obeying your order, we have to say, "Cat, we mice are 
better off without your help."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pak-U.S. Talks"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has said that the 
United States is the only superpower in the world and it has to 
have a role in resolving the Kashmir issue. It can also play a 
role in ending the dissension between India and Pakistan. 
Therefore, she wishes to improve relations with the United 
States. She was addressing a news conference on Thursday in the 
chamber of the National Assembly, and said that she had promised 
the people that there will be no roll back [of the nuclear 
program]. She said that bilateral talks with the United States 
have started and the government was trying to resolve the 
difference without any roll back. She said that pushing Pakistan 
in the corner will not benefit anyone since Pakistan has already 
presented a proposal for stopping proliferation of nuclear 
weapons. However, India wants to reject this proposal 
unilaterally. The prime minister said that the Pressler 
amendment gave India a kind of veto power which is being using 
unfairly against Pakistan. She said that the United States must 
adopt an impartial stand if it wants to resolve the Kashmir 
issue and end the nuclear weapons race in this sub-continent. 
She said that we needed F-16 fighter planes badly in the past, 
and still do, however, we are also investigating other fighter 
planes that are more appropriate for Pakistan's defense. She 
said that we will neither roll back [the nuclear program] nor 
will we allow them to inspect our installations just for getting 
F-16 fighter planes. She said that we are old allies of the 
United States and understand why Pakistan is always pressured. 
The prime minister said that Pakistan wants a regional agreement 
to control nuclear weapons. She said that there was a 
nation-wide agreement that we should not open our nuclear 
installations for inspection, however, we will reconsider this 
stand if India takes the initiative. 
  The talks with Pakistan and the United States over regional 
problems and weapons are being held at a time when India has 
openly disagreed with the United States, the U.S. Deputy 
Secretary of State could not even meet with the Indian prime 
minister, and the BBC has declared these talks a failure. 
Meanwhile, the United States has threatened military action 
against North Korea and has expressed its intentions to put 
pressure on North Korea with the help of China and Japan. North 
Korea has refused to accept U.S. conditions. India has also 
adopted a similar attitude and has not shown any interest in the 
proposals for stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. The 
coolness towards the U.S. proposals expressed in New Delhi is 
heralding a new fearful situation in this region. Pakistan has a 
well-known stand on nuclear non-proliferation and regional 
problems. Still, there are fears that Pakistan might become a 
prey of U.S. pressure. The situation demands that the United 
States should have the same attitude towards India as it has 
adopted about [North] Korea. This kind of arrogance and defiance 
can endanger the safety of the whole region. It is true that the 
United States can play an important role in establishing peace 
and resolving issues in South Asia, however, U.S. interests and 
preferences are also clearly written on the wall. Although the 
government has shown a realistic attitude, we feel that there 
are some sensitive issues involved in the present U.S.-Pakistan 
talks. Political observers have special interest in seeing the 
confrontation between India and Pakistan end, and the safety of 
this region now depends on Pakistan-United States talks. This 
will test our government's judgment, shrewdness, diplomatic 
skills so that it is successful in explaining its side to the 
United States. It is generally believed that the U.S. deputy 
secretary of state has come here from Washington with a definite 
plan which includes some undesirable proposals for Pakistan. The 
prime minister has adopted a strong stand on closing the chapter 
on Pakistan's concerns regarding F-16 planes and has respected 
the nation's desires by refusing to compromise over the nuclear 
program. The government's stand is appropriate that any 
agreement in South Asia must be bilateral, and there is no use 
of binding one country with restrictions imposed by the other 
side.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Talbott's Tilt Towards India"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's 
talks with Indian Foreign Minister Dinesh Singh and his 
conversation with the news reporters at the airport before 
leaving for Pakistan indicate that the United States is leaning 
towards India. The United States will not make any decision 
against India over issues such as Kashmir, nuclear program, and 
sale of F-16s to Pakistan. The U.S. deputy secretary of state 
has explicitly assured India that if Pakistan did not stop its 
nuclear program, it will not be given F-16 fighter planes. 
Connecting the nuclear program with the F-16 sale is totally 
inappropriate. Refusing to supply these planes after the deal 
was agreed upon and money paid is pure dishonesty and a drastic 
action. Pakistan had expressed willingness to cancel the deal 
and accept the money paid in advance if the United States did 
not want to sell these fighter planes. However, the United 
States in its arrogance as a superpower is not willing to return 
this money. The U.S. secretary of state has said that the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons is endangering world peace, and 
steps must be taken to stop their spread. Pakistan also supports 
stopping proliferation of nuclear weapons, however, it is 
important to roll back India's nuclear program for this purpose. 
Ideally, India should be asked first to stop nuclear experiments 
and making nuclear weapons because it is way ahead in the 
nuclear field. Pakistan does not even have the capability to use 
nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. The question of making 
nuclear weapons does not even arise. the United States knows all 
this, but still is putting the whole pressure on Pakistan. It 
supports India over the Kashmir issue in addition to the nuclear 
program. 
  The U.S. comment that it considers Kashmir a disputed issue 
between India and Pakistan is not enough. Even India 
acknowledges that and the whole world is aware of it. India and 
Pakistan have fought several wars over the Kashmir issue, and 
the tension between the two countries is increasing now. The two 
countries can start another war over Kashmir. Therefore, to 
ensure peace in South Asia, it is important to resolve the 
Kashmir issue first. The United States insists that this issue 
be resolved according to Shimla accord instead of following the 
UN resolutions. Thus, Mr. Strobe Talbott has supported the 
Indian stand and said that the two countries should resolve this 
issue according to the Shimla accord. If this issue could be 
resolved according to the so-called Shimla accord, it would have 
been resolved a long time ago, and there would be no need to 
bring the United States into it. The real solution of the 
Kashmir problem is to get the Kashmiri people their right to 
self-determination so that they can decide with whom to merge. 
  As a superpower and a champion of world peace, the United 
States has the moral and political responsibility to try to 
resolve the Kashmir issue according to the UN resolutions. This 
is the only fair and peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue. 
The people of Pakistan and Kashmir will not accept any other 
alternative. The Kashmiris now sense that the United States and 
the United Nations have no interest in resolving this issue, 
therefore, they have started their struggle to get rid of the 
Indian occupancy, and will continue it until they have won their 
freedom.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A New Pressure"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott 
has declared India the greatest democracy in the world while 
paying tribute to India. He said that it is the leader of this 
region because of its democratic traditions, size, and 
stability. He said that India is the strongest candidate to 
become a member of the UN Security Council. Mr. Talbott was 
addressing a press conference on Friday in Delhi after talking 
with the Indian government. Mr. Talbott assured the Indian 
government that F-16 fighter planes will be supplied to Pakistan 
only after Pakistan stops production of nuclear weapons and 
provides assurance to freeze its nuclear program. He said that 
both India and Pakistan are suspicious of American efforts and 
are refusing to sign the NPT. He said that the Kashmir issue 
could ignite a destructive war between the two countries and 
that is why the issue of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons 
was getting most of U.S. attention. He said that both countries 
should resolve the Kashmir issue by holding bilateral talks 
according to the Shimla pact. He made it clear that the United 
States was not favoring Pakistan. 
  Mr. Strobe Talbott is not only the deputy secretary of 
state, 
he is also an expert on policies on weapons reduction. He was 
not very successful in his mission in India because India 
refused to cooperate in any plan for weapons reduction or 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. After several days talks 
with the ministers and the prime minister, the U.S. deputy 
secretary of state has unilaterally put the whole pressure on 
Pakistan. However, the Pakistan Air Force has already lost 
interest in F-16 fighter planes and is busy looking at fighter 
planes in other countries. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has 
hinted that Pakistan does not need F-16 planes. Both the 
president and the prime minister have loudly declared that 
Pakistan's nuclear program will not be frozen. The Pakistani 
government let this stand be known when Mr. Talbott was holding 
his press conference in New Delhi. This was a psychological 
pressure and the Pakistani government neutralized it. The U.S. 
deputy secretary's announcement about getting a certificate from 
Pakistani government promising to cap its nuclear program is 
equivalent to our opening up our nuclear installations for 
inspection. Since Pakistan has announced that it is not 
interested in F-16 fighter planes, the demand for inspecting the 
nuclear installations has become ineffective. However, Mr. 
Talbott continued to increase this psychological pressure and 
announced the desire to make India a member of the Security 
Council. He advocated inclusion of Germany and Japan in the 
Security Council in his press conference and declared India to 
be the best candidate for membership to the Security Council. 
Mr. Talbott's has tried to create a soft spot for the United 
States in the Indian mind. As the result of it, the Indian prime 
minister has accepted the U.S. invitation to visit the United 
States. At the same time, the United States has used this 
strategy to put additional pressure on Pakistan. The goal of all 
this is to make India the "police inspector" of South Asia and 
to stop Pakistan from its defense preparations. 
  Pakistan should not take time to understand what is hidden 
in 
this new U.S. strategy because India's inclusion in the Security 
Council is absolutely dangerous for Pakistan. The United States 
used this psychological weapon against Pakistan. However, 
Pakistan should not forget the fact that if the United States 
wants to appoint India the custodian of its interests in this 
region, Pakistan will not change its policies even when it 
accepts all U.S. conditions with its eyes closed. Even if the 
United States has said this is just to placate India, its 
pressure on Pakistan's policies will continue. These lines are 
being written at a time when two U.S. deputy secretaries of 
state--Mr. Talbott and Ms. Raphel--are busy in negotiations in 
Islamabad. General Abdul Waheed, Pakistan army chief, has 
returned to London after his talks in Washington and is on his 
way home. During the last few months, there have been several 
rounds of talks on security of this region. However, the present 
talks are being called final. It is important to mention here 
that before the recent round of talks between Pakistan and the 
United States, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and President 
Farooq Leghari have expressed the government's definite stand 
that neither our nuclear program will be capped nor our national 
interests will be compromised. The government has dropped its 
unusual interest in acquiring F-16 fighter planes. Despite this 
all, the Pakistani government should keep a close eye on the new 
changes that have occurred in relations among Pakistan, India, 
and the United States.

<F P=106> [Article by Altaf Hasan Qureshi: "Announcement About Secret </F>
Talks"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Talbott visited 
India and Pakistan and after going through his long agenda has 
left glorious hopes of establishing peace and stability not only 
in South Asia but in the whole world. He told news reporters 
that he considered his visit to be extremely successful and gave 
the good news to Secretary of State Christopher on the phone 
that Pakistan has promised to consider even those proposals that 
are not fully acceptable to it. The most important development 
is that the United States and Pakistan have announced that they 
will follow "silent diplomacy" in the future. Perhaps that is 
the reason why the Pakistani foreign minister had refused to 
answer reporters' questions and Mr. Talbott used mostly prepared 
diplomatic statements. 
  The United States is looking for markets and places to build 
military bases to protect its interests in southern, central, 
and western Asia because of the geographical, military, and 
economic importance of these regions. Its main goals is to stop 
China's progress and to create a powerful bloc to counter it. It 
considers India as the most appropriate partner in this game. 
The United States is tolerating its whims and coquetry and 
appears to be willing to bear its aggressive diplomacy also. The 
Indian leadership adopted a contemptuous attitude towards Mr. 
Talbott. The prime minister did not give him an appointment and 
the foreign minister also kept his distance. The farewell press 
conference was also cancelled at the last minute. This was in 
response to the U.S. deputy secretary's flattery, praise, and 
commendations that he had lavished on India while ignoring all 
the facts. He said that India's leadership in this region and 
outside of it is well established, and its leadership is strong 
like that of Germany and Japan. Despite this humble sycophancy, 
India refused to discuss its missile and nuclear program and 
scornfully rejected the idea of a multi-national conference. Mr. 
Talbott returned after losing face. 
  A whole new world was waiting to meet him when he arrived 
here. Our Foreign Secretary Najamuldin Sheikh welcomed him. The 
photograph of the welcome ceremony that was published in The 
DAWN relates a strange story. Mr. Talbott was looking into Mr. 
Sheikh's eyes as if a hunter was ready to snare its prey. 
Pakistan did its duty as a host more than necessary. The 
president, the prime minister, the foreign minister, and other 
high-ranking officials hovered around him as if he were an 
emperor and a red carpet was rolled out for him. General Abdul 
Waheed, our commander in chief, had already established a frank 
tone about our nuclear program in Washington. The opposition 
leaders interpreted our nation's wishes the same way and said 
that we will not roll back the nuclear program and change our 
position on Kashmir. Benazir also repeated the issue of our 
national security clearly. Thus the whole nation was speaking 
with one voice. The U.S. deputy secretary could not be 
successful in his goals in the presence of such strong feelings 
among the people. Thus, a joint announcement to follow "silent 
diplomacy" was made. 
  The joint communique issued at the time of Mr. Talbott's 
departure has some aspects that cause major concerns. However, 
the people here are mostly concerned about the "silent 
diplomacy." The meaning of this term is to conduct secret deals. 
Benazir had decided to cap the nuclear program in 1989 without 
taking the nation into confidence using this "silent diplomacy." 
Information about it was first given by the caretaker Prime 
Minister Moeen Qureshi four years later and Benazir had admitted 
to it a few months later. This means that the United States can 
prepare Pakistan for opening up its nuclear installations for 
inspection through some secret agreement. All kind of attractive 
suggestions are being made about this "inspection." One is to 
let them take some photographs from a satellite and the U.S. 
President will use these photographs to issue a certificate to 
the U.S. Congress assuring it that Pakistan does not have 
nuclear capability. Later, F-16s will also be delivered and 
economic and military aid will be reinstated. All kind of 
deceptions will be used at every step. They will say, this one 
point is a little vague and it needs to be looked at. This will 
start a never-ending series [of negotiations] and we will meet 
the same fate as Iraq did. 
  Whenever the United States has used the pressure of secret 
negotiations in Muslim regions, it has hurt Muslim interests. In 
the PLO-Israel secret negotiations, it sold the freedom of 
Palestinian people very cheaply. Before this, the Camp David 
Agreement, which also was signed after secret negotiations, was 
used to sell the national pride and ambitions of the Egyptians. 
A great nation was forced to bow down to Israel and became a 
slave to the U.S. interests. This "silent diplomacy" of the 
United States had prompted Saddam Hussein to suddenly invade 
Kuwait. 
  The question is: If Pakistan's stand on nuclear program and 
Kashmir is exactly according to international principles and it 
has a strong logic behind it, then what is the meaning of 
holding talks behind thousands of screens? This means only one 
thing: A powerful superpower wants to quietly dominate Pakistan 
so that no one is aware of it. The foundation of this great 
tragedy has been laid in the joint communique. This high-handed 
and quiet diplomacy can be countered only by the power of the 
people. The United States have always been defeated by the 
unbreakable determination of the people as in Vietnam and 
Somalia. The Pakistani people have only one alternative to 
fulfill their goal. They should call a joint session of the 
Parliament and provide a framework to this fundamental issue. 
The government should not have the permission to get out of this 
framework. A powerful committee composed of senior Parliament 
Members, well-known retired generals, diplomats, experienced 
journalists, and observers should be established. This committee 
will monitor all negotiations and keep the nation informed. How 
can we accept secret negotiations when our lives are involved? 
The United States, instead of following principles and 
practicing fairness, is seeing its interests as requirements for 
world peace. Our governments did not feel any hesitancy in 
compromising our national pride just to prolong their 
terms.

<F P=106> [Article by Malik Altaf Hussein: "Talbott's Visit: Hopes and </F>
Fears"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott 
returned to the United States on 12 April after his two day 
visit to Islamabad. Mr. Talbott had discussions with the 
president, the prime minister, the foreign minister, and other 
important officials. There was no limited agenda for these 
talks. The earlier impression was that these talks would 
especially focus on the nuclear program and Kashmir. Mr. Talbott 
himself said in a press conference later that they had 
discussions covering a broad agenda. In addition to Middle East 
and South Asian affairs, establishment of peace, the nuclear 
program, Kashmir, and trade, they also discussed bilateral 
regional affairs. The joint communique issued at the conclusion 
of his visit announced the "greater agreement" between the two 
countries and the representatives of both countries called the 
visit very successful. 
  There is concern in Pakistan over the situation under which 
the U.S. representatives visited our country. The feeling about 
the United States in Pakistan was not very good because of the 
suspension of U.S. military and economic aid, pressure on the 
nuclear program, and coolness over the Kashmir issue. Every 
Pakistani was watching the U.S. deputy secretary's visit to New 
Delhi and Islamabad very closely. If we take a close look at 
Talbott's visit and listen to government sources, we will not be 
able to believe that this trip was successful from Pakistani 
perspective. It would have been called successful if the U.S. 
pressure on the Pakistani nuclear program was lifted, a promise 
to reinstate military and economic aid was made, a desire was 
expressed to deliver the F-16s, the cost of which was already 
paid, some proposal was made to reduce the pressure put by the 
Pressler amendment, an emphasis was given to resolve the Kashmir 
issue according to the UN resolutions, some major trade plan was 
brought to light, or some words about Pakistan were said like 
were used for India calling it the leader of this region and 
outside of it (even though all neighboring nations are suffering 
from India's expansionist designs and its craze for war). 
However, we have to say with great sadness that if we carefully 
analyze the joint communique, and the statements he gave at the 
press conferences in New Delhi and Islamabad, we do not see any 
thing that can hint that the U.S. delegation has proposed any 
concrete and realistic plan to protect Pakistan's interests. 
Instead, we see a beautiful play on words in the joint 
communique and any other words that the U.S. deputy secretary 
uttered. In the end, Pakistan gets "nothing" and the United 
States keeps "everything." 
  Talbott's statements and the joint communique indicate that 
Pakistan's point of view was not listened to. It appears that 
the U.S. and Indian interests were the big winners in this 
visit. These goals and concerns can be understood by the points 
raised below. 
  Mr. Talbott announced in the New Delhi press conference that 
he needed proof of Pakistan freezing its nuclear program. F-16s 
will not be delivered if the nuclear program is not rolled back. 
The United States does not favor Pakistan, will not force India 
and Pakistan to sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty], 
recognizes India as a leader even outside this region, and the 
Kashmir issue is to be resolved by holding bilateral talks 
according to the Shimla accord. Let us take a brief look at how 
these views expressed by the U.S. deputy secretary of state in a 
press conference in New Delhi support the Indian view point and 
goals. 
  Without criticizing or expressing concern over India's eight 
reactors which have been worked on day and night for military 
purposes or India's nuclear blast in 1974, the asking for proof 
of Pakistan's freezing its nuclear program is accepting the 
India point of view. Pakistan's decision to unilaterally freeze 
its nuclear program was a great show of goodwill and cooperation 
towards the United States and India. Pakistan did not get any 
"incentives" from the United States or India in exchange. 
However, instead of thanking Pakistan for this exemplary act of 
cooperation, they increased pressure on Pakistan. The talks 
about not delivering F-16s is also according to Indian wishes 
although Pakistan was talking about the F-16s that are already 
paid for. "The United States does not lean toward Pakistan," 
these words were also delivered according to India's wishes. It 
was not necessary to say this since Pakistan is an older and 
more trusted friend in contrast to India. Mr. Talbott's 
announcement that the United States will not force India and 
Pakistan to sign the NPT is also favoring India on this point. 
India has continuously declared that it will not sign the NPT 
even when Pakistan signs it. The Indian prime minister repeated 
this stand a few days before Mr. Talbott's visit. The original 
U.S. position was that both India and Pakistan should sign the 
NPT. Pakistan would have benefitted from this U.S. stand and it 
is based on fairness. The governments preceding Benazir Bhutto 
had adamantly demanded that Pakistan and India should sign the 
NPT together. The United States had also endorsed this stand. 
The U.S. announcement that it will not force India and Pakistan 
to sign the NPT is creating a new situation which will benefit 
India only. This will, however, increase tension in this region. 
The words, "India is the major leader in this region," clearly 
prove that the United States wants to give an "important role" 
to India in this region. It wants to influence Pakistan's 
relations with China, Afghanistan, newly independent Central 
Asian republics, and Iran. The idea of resolving the Kashmir 
issue by holding bilateral talks according to Shimla accord is 
also part of Indian policy. Since talks between India and 
Pakistan during our 45 years of history have never been 
successful, the Kashmir issue cannot be resolved with these 
talks. Actually, India wants to use these talks as an excuse to 
buy time to crush the Kashmiri freedom fighters. The most 
effective way to resolve the Kashmir issue is to implement the 
UN resolutions. However, the deputy secretary never mentioned 
the UN resolutions in New Delhi or Islamabad and the Pakistani 
foreign minister did not remember it, either. 
  After this brief review of hidden U.S. and Indian interests 
in Mr. Talbott's statement given in the New Delhi press 
conference before leaving for Islamabad, let us discuss what he 
said after reaching Islamabad. Did he give any breaks to 
Pakistan on arriving here or only decisions that serve U.S. 
interests? 
  1. The first success the U.S. deputy secretary had in 
Islamabad was Pakistan's submission of the proposal to freeze 
its nuclear program. In other words, Mr. Talbott's statement 
delivered in New Delhi that "I will get proof of freezing the 
nuclear program in Pakistan" was recognized here immediately. 
Even more troublesome is the decision for the two countries to 
do all this through "confidential diplomacy." What does this 
"confidential diplomacy" mean? When Pakistan has officially 
declared a freeze on its nuclear program, why do we need 
"confidential diplomacy" to get proof for it? The Pakistani 
people were already told that the nuclear program has been 
suspended. What confidential information that might create 
public outcry is left to be told to the United States? The truth 
is that the secret in this "confidential diplomacy" is the one 
that made the United States win the Cold War and the Soviet 
Union lose it. The fear is that Pakistani government wants to 
roll back its nuclear program while practicing this 
"confidential diplomacy." It should be clear that Pakistan's 
nuclear program was frozen in July 1990 through this 
"confidential diplomacy." As for the proof of freezing the 
nuclear program, these are the words that are being used to 
deceive Pakistani people. How is it possible that the United 
States has no proof of this freeze introduced in 1990? The truth 
is that just like the way this "confidential diplomacy" was used 
in July 1990 to freeze Pakistan's nuclear program, it will be 
used now for taking the "next step." The word "confidential" 
here is not used because of some international protocol, it is 
being used to keep the Pakistani people "ignorant" of facts. 
These words of mine get support from our national hero Dr. 
Qadeer Khan's careful words, "I have nothing left to say. I will 
talk when I have something to say." 
  2. Regarding our foreign ministry's spokesman's statement 
that Pakistan will not accept unilateral and discriminating 
restrictions on its nuclear and missile program, [we ask] why 
did we give up our principled stand on signing the NPT and agree 
to resolve these issues by "confidential diplomacy?" Further, if 
the talk about providing proof of freezing the nuclear program 
is not equivalent to accepting discriminating restrictions, then 
what else is it? Has India taken such a step to freeze its 
nuclear program and provide proof of it through "confidential 
diplomacy?" 
  3. The joint communique did not promise any military and 
economic aid to Pakistan and did not mention F-16s. All it said 
was that Pakistan's military and political interests will not be 
hurt. In other words, despite recognizing Pakistan's defense 
needs, no assurance of concrete assistance was given. More 
concerns were expressed over the situation in Kashmir, but 
India, who is responsible for all this, was not criticized. 
  The truth is that Mr. Talbott's visit to Pakistan was in 
connection with "rolling back" Pakistan's nuclear program and 
talks about a broad agenda was floated to hide this. If there is 
any truth about this broader agenda, then some decisions about 
Pakistan's concerns and problems should have been brought to 
light. However, it appears that Mr. Talbott did "fill his file" 
while Pakistan's drawer remained closed. All our concerns, 
problems and needs were just given some flat comments and left 
as were before. 
  Anyhow, the present government is sure of coordinating the 
"U.S. friendship" and "our national interests." However, the 
situation indicates that the government has to sacrifice either 
the U.S. friendship or our national interests.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Maqsood Anwar: "Government's New Strategy </F>
and Foreign Investments"] 
  [Text] According to one report, our government has 
clarified a new policy for foreign investment in our country. 
According to this policy, Arab nations will be given a 
preferential status for investing money here over Western 
nations. The Investment Promotion Bureau [IPB] and the 
Investment Board [IB] will be made more effective. The 
government plans to pay more attention to agricultural 
industries. In order to attract foreign investors, investment 
centers will be established in the embassies and here in 
Pakistan. Various conferences and seminars will be held in 
countries that show interest in investing in Pakistan. 
  The wrong policies and plans of former governments, foreign 
investment in Pakistan was not encouraged enough and not much 
attention was given to it. Each of our governments had tried to 
get money from the West, however, our planner forgot that the 
interests of the Western nations have nothing to do with our own 
interests. The Western nations look for ways to interfere in our 
internal affairs under the guise of investing here and they find 
various ways to put political pressure on us. For example, the 
United States has suspended military and economic aid to 
Pakistan. Its condition is that Pakistan must freeze its nuclear 
program. It is not willing to impose this condition on India and 
wants to put all these restriction on Pakistan alone. When the 
Western nations fail to realize their political and economic 
interests, they break their promises and stop their aid. The 
United States has also restricted Pakistan's exports and has 
imposed major restrictions on our textiles production. The same 
is true for other Western nations. Even some Asian countries 
under U.S. influence are treating Pakistan similarly. The 
Western nations impose strict requirements for investing money. 
They try to make the developing countries the markets for their 
products and do not import products from these developing 
nations. 
  We should have paid attention to it a long time ago, because 
we not only have trade and economic relations with Arab nations, 
we also have historical, religious, cultural, and social 
relations with them. The Arab nations do not insist on imposing 
strict rules for investing money like the Western nations do. 
All they want is security of their capital. In exchange, they 
will take interest in purchasing Pakistani products. The Arab 
nations have a great demand for agricultural products. The 
present government has shown far-sight by including Arab 
investors in agricultural industries. Most of the Arab nations 
are not self-sufficient in growing food grains. The Arab 
investment will help develop our agricultural industry and the 
export of agricultural products to Arab nations will prove a 
boon for us. Our agricultural production will be exported to 
friendly Arab nations. This will increase our exports and the 
food grains need of the Arab nations will also be met. The Nawaz 
Sharif government had also tried to give special entitlement to 
foreign investors and also held a major seminar here. A large 
number of European investors had participated in that seminar, 
however, there were no concrete results. Some reasons for 
limited foreign investment in Pakistan are our bureaucratic 
rules and regulations, shortage of electric power, and the 
problem of law and order. The program that our government has 
formulated for luring Arab investors should pay special 
attention to alleviating the problem of shortage of electric 
power. It is a common complaint that our trade attaches in other 
countries do not pay attention to it, although it is their duty 
to look for new sources of investment and increase our trade. 
  We need cooperation from trade and industrial circles to 
hold 
conferences and seminars in Arab countries for attracting their 
investment. To this end, first we should send deputations of 
experts to these countries to establish individual relations 
with the investors there. We must establish centers in these 
countries to encourage investments and a regular advertising 
campaign should also be started. It would be better to invite 
Arab investors to visit Pakistan and present to them details of 
agricultural areas in which they can benefit. The government 
should review old reports on plans for attracting foreign 
investment and find out the reasons for the failure of those 
plans. Until these problems are alleviated, neither will success 
in this area be possible nor can we make better plans.

Qureshi   Claimed Plotting Return to Power

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Arrival of Ex-Caretaker Prime Minister"] </F>
  [Text] According to one news report former caretaker prime 
minister of Pakistan, Moeen Qureshi, is coming to Pakistan with 
a package from the World Bank. It is believed that he will try 
to convince the government to accept the tax reforms proposed by 
the World Bank. The mention of a package from the World Bank 
just when the budget is being prepared and the return of former 
caretaker prime minister to Pakistan make the people 
distrustful. Those who know the present situation are not 
ignorant of the fact that the IMF, the World Bank, and other 
financial organizations have always worried about Pakistani 
people not having enough taxes. They also believe that the 
people here do not have the heavy burden of energy costs as they 
should have according to international standards. These 
financial organizations do not like the prevalent rates of 
electricity, natural gas, and petrol. In each budget, increase 
in the prices of energy items and taxes is done because of the 
pressure from these financial organizations. 
  All these organizations including the World Bank are unaware 
of the fact that the wages earned by the employees in Pakistan 
are much lower than international rates. They are also unaware 
about the lack of such amenities as social security that are 
given to people in exchange for taxes. The situation in 
education, health, living, and employment is not satisfactory in 
our country. The Pakistani people do not even know about the 
international standard of living. In this situation, the World 
Bank's assertion that Pakistan's tax rate is not equal to the 
international level is not correct. If these monetary 
institutions are interested in Pakistan then they should help 
bring the living standards of the people here close, if not 
equal, to international standards. When the people here have 
international-level living standards, then we can demand 
additional taxes from them 
  The wave of escalating prices that has drowned the nation 
before the budget has ruined people's sleep. Prices of flour, 
pulses, sugar, ghee, milk, meat, and other staples have risen 
dramatically and artificially. It is a delusion to think that 
this pre-budget increase in prices is just so they can call this 
the budget of the people, and no additional burden of price 
increases will be put on the people. 
  The fears felt by the people are getting stronger with the 
return of the former caretaker prime minister and his mission. 
The people are especially worried because he is bringing a 
package from the World Bank. It is not considered impossible 
that Mr. Moeen Qureshi will try to force the government to 
accept these proposals. It is considered possible since during 
his government he had resonantly announced, "If the future 
government disagreed with my policies, it will not last." 
  The reliable information and the government's attitude 
indicate that the government has already accepted the pressure 
being put by the World Bank, the IMF, and other financial 
institutions to an extent. The affect of this agreement has been 
directly felt by the people also. Chowdhery Shujait Hussain, 
former home minister and senator, has said in this context that 
this year the budget will be prepared by the IMF and major 
smugglers in our country. The government should understand the 
deteriorating economic situation of the people here before it 
implements the reforms suggested by the World Bank. It should 
burden the poor with only as much taxes as they can tolerate. 
The misfortune of the poor in the third world is that despite 
political freedom, they are wearing the chains of slavery in 
economic and defense areas. They can neither decide on their 
economic development plans nor can they fulfill their defense 
needs according to their wishes. Our country's tragedy is that 
since our independence we have been subjected to unbearable 
international restrictions. Pakistan has sacrificed its 
interests for a long time during the Cold War between the two 
superpowers. Now, the slavery of these financial organization is 
its destiny. This plan to keep the third world in shackles and 
ruling it is hindering the progress of all developing countries, 
including Pakistan. Our government's lack of strategic planning 
and tendency for expediency have helped the evolution of this 
heinous practice. Our rulers have depended more on world powers 
than the power of the people to save their government. The 
challenge to this government that claims to be democratic is 
whether it protects the interests of the people or those of the 
international financial organizations.

  [Text] Major General (Retd.) Nasirullah Babar, federal home 
minister, has announced that all foreigners including Arabs 
living here will be deported. The home minister told the news 
reporters in Peshawar about his government's decision that all 
foreigners who took part in the Afghanistan jihad will be 
deported from Pakistan. The truth is that this action is being 
taken under U.S. pressure. Calling the Arab nationals living in 
Pakistan terrorists and instigators is inappropriate and an 
extreme action. These people support an Islamic form of 
government and are those who took part in the Afghanistan jihad 
against the Russian aggression. The service they have provided 
to the Muslim world and Pakistan by leaving their far away 
countries to participate in the Afghanistan jihad cannot be 
forgotten. These are the mujaheddin who protected Afghanistan 
and Pakistan from the oppression of communism and the Soviet 
Union. They participated in the Afghan jihad side-by-side with 
the Afghan brothers without any racial or regional prejudice, 
and made many sacrifices. They still have great courage and are 
ready to help the Muslim world wherever brutalities are 
committed against them. The truth is that these Arab nationals 
are an asset to Pakistan. They can be used in the jihad in 
Kashmir. 
  They are ready to go to occupied Kashmir to help our 
Kashmiri 
brothers in their struggle for independence just like they 
helped in Afghanistan. India and its ally, the United States, 
are worried about it. The United States does not want the 
movement of Kashmiris to become like the one in Afghanistan. 
Therefore, it wants them expelled from Pakistan by accusing them 
of terrorism. The Government of Pakistan should not play into 
U.S. hands at all!

<F P=106> [Article by Khawaja Abdur Rashid: "The Militant </F>
Organizations in Occupied Kashmir"] 
  [Text] There has been neither a government nor any 
political process in occupied Kashmir for the last five years. 
India has been working hard to establish a political process and 
stage a show of holding elections there for the last two years. 
However, it failed badly in its efforts. Now again, the Indian 
government has established a committee to reinstate a political 
process in occupied Kashmir. This committee, composed of 
parliament members, will present recommendations on how to 
restart a political process. Earlier, India had tried to bring 
its former faithful and loyal Kashmiris forward to do this job. 
Dr. Farooq Abdullah was given a lot of coverage in the media in 
this context. He was sent abroad as a member of Indian 
deputations and efforts were made to send him to military areas 
in Srinagar behind military security. The Kashmiri people were 
told that Dr. Farooq Abdullah's recommendations are very 
important in freeing Kashmiri freedom fighters in Indian 
military custody and that he can help in resolving other issues 
also. Thus, Farooq Abdullah sat in Srinagar's military camp, 
sent out a message to the people, and waited for them to come 
visit him. However, soon the Indian government learned that the 
Kashmiri people have not only dismissed Dr. Farooq Abdullah, but 
also hate him. Not only Farooq Abdullah, but every pro-India 
Kashmiri is the target of their hatred. After the assassination 
of Wali Mohammed Raitu, former speaker of Kashmir Assembly, 
pro-India Kashmir politicians living in Jammu and Indian areas 
felt unprotected and were looking for protection. The Indian 
government deployed additional troops for their protection. The 
Indian efforts to establish a political process in Kashmir were 
greatly set back by Wali Mohammed Raitu's assassination. The 
pro-India Kashmiri politicians are scared and are hesitating in 
supporting India now. They are not prepared to come out in the 
open. The Kashmiri leaders associated with the National 
Conference and the Congress Party consider themselves 
unprotected despite all the security. They are moving to other 
cities quietly. This situation shows that India's plans to 
establish a political process in Kashmir appears to be ruined 
again. 
  Meanwhile the militant organizations in occupied Kashmir 
have 
made it clear that they will not let any efforts to establish 
political process in the state be successful. The control of the 
Indian military is limited to around military camps only. No 
system is left for the daily administration of cities and 
villages. On the other hand, the freedom fighters have full 
control over their areas and they administrate the daily affairs 
there. The Indian soldiers and paramilitary forces enjoy a broad 
range of privileges. However, because of their fear of the 
freedom fighters, they have become very corrupt. For a little 
money they even sell their weapons and ammunition. The military 
officers have to court martial soldiers every other day for 
selling weapons and ammunition. The incidence of corruption is 
so frequent that even Indian newspapers have started to publish 
news about it. The Indian government and the military high 
command are greatly perturbed by this situation. One reason for 
their distress is that despite quick transfers and other actions 
they cannot put a stop to these corrupt practices. Some 
observers have suggested that the Indian military and 
paramilitary personnel have become demoralized as they have no 
clear goal for fighting this war against the invisible enemy in 
Kashmir. In addition to selling weapons, they also destroy them 
and relate incidents of imaginary confrontations with the 
freedom fighters and losing their weapons there. 
  The laws, especially anti-Muslim laws, that were prevalent 
in 
occupied Kashmir before the present campaign began are slowly 
disappearing. Slaughtering cows in occupied Kashmir was a crime. 
This law was enacted during the Dogra regime. A person whose 
"crime" of slaughtering a cow was proved was sentenced to 14 
years of hard labor in jail. This law is still part of the 
present legal books in occupied Kashmir. However, now people 
slaughter cows openly and eat its meat with great pleasure. 
These days, beef is sold at 35 rupees per kilogram in Srinagar 
in the open market. Other anti-Muslim laws in occupied Kashmir 
are meeting the same luck. Even the Indian officials there know 
that India has no future in occupied Kashmir and the Kashmiri 
people will not accept India. 
  Although political processes has ended in occupied Kashmir 
and the militant organizations have taken over, Sayyed Gailani 
and Shabir Ahmed Shah have great influence among the people. 
Amanullah Khan of the Liberation Front is also greatly respected 
there. However, Sayyed Gailani and Shabir Ahmed Shah are revered 
there and perhaps that is the reason India has jailed them. A 
major part of these leaders' lives is being spent in Indian 
jails. The feeling that India refuses to accept any practical 
solution to the Kashmir problem just because of its enmity 
toward Pakistan and its unwillingness to work with Pakistan to 
find a solution gives strength to the political leaders in 
occupied and Azad Kashmir. Therefore, we should provide an 
opportunity to Kashmiri leaders on both sides of the Line of 
Control to find a respectable solution to this problem. This 
feeling was expressed by the All Parties Huriat Conference and 
Azad Kashmir leaders, especially Prime Minister Sardar Abdul 
Qayum Khan many times. This idea is getting support in Western 
nations now. It was learned that Lord Aubry of the British 
Parliament is trying to organize a conference in which Kashmiri 
leaders from both sides can participate. President Abdul Qayum 
Khan has expressed a desire to participate in this conference if 
the leaders of occupied Kashmir are also given the opportunity 
to participate in it. There is no restriction on him or any Azad 
Kashmir leader for participation in this conference. However, 
India will not permit leaders of occupied Kashmir to 
participate. If these leaders are not allowed to take part in 
this conference, the main goal of this conference will not be 
achieved and his participation will be useless. India should 
create an appropriate environment if it desires to improve the 
situation in occupied Kashmir and wants to find an acceptable 
solution of the Kashmir problem. Otherwise, it would be 
understood that India is not willing to be 
reasonable.

<F P=106> [Article by Shehzad Iqbal Lolabi: "Acceleration of Freedom </F>
Fighter Activities"] 
  [Text] The freedom fighters in Kashmir have accelerated 
their activities against India's inhuman atrocities and have 
caused serious damage to the Indian army. Forty bodies were 
recovered from the rubble left in India's largest military camp 
in occupied Kashmir which the freedom fighters had attacked 
recently. In addition to Major General Fernandes, five 
brigadiers and 10 colonels were among those killed. These 
military officers had come to Srinagar to participate in an 
important meeting to discuss plans to crush militant activities 
in Kashmir. Some bodies were badly disfigured from burning and 
were not recognizable. Major General Fernandes and several other 
officers had come to Srinagar for an emergency meeting called by 
Rajesh Pilot to plan a new strategy. During this meeting, there 
were some powerful blasts and these officers were buried under 
rubble. Important Indian sources and the New Delhi government 
have declared the deaths of military officers in occupied 
Kashmir to be the worst incident in recent months. According to 
Kashmir Media Service, it took a long time to put out the fire 
and find bodies. The Indian army had blockaded all the roads 
leading to Badami Bagh during this time and even the local 
workers were not allowed to travel. 
  According to the spokesmen for the Kashmiri freedom 
fighters, 
this is the first step. If the Indian army continues its 
atrocities and does not end the siege of Hazratbal, more 
destructive and dangerous steps will be taken. The situation in 
the region has become more tense after the atrocious actions of 
the Indian military. The Indian military is patrolling all roads 
and many young men were shot to death during Indian troops' 
vicious activities. Most of the freedom fighters are being 
subjected to inhuman afflictions in torture chambers. The 
Jumiatul Mujaheddin and the Ikhwanul Musalmin have jointly 
accepted responsibility for attacking the Indian military camp 
in Badami Bagh in the vicinity of Srinagar. According to a 
correspondent of Islamic News International, the mujaheddin 
launched this attack at the time when the Indian military 
officers were looking at an exhibition of ammunition, that 
according to them was seized from the freedom fighters in the 
Badami Bagh camp. The freedom fighter targeted a patrol tanker 
parked near there with rockets. The fire from this tanker 
engulfed the whole camp. One major general and three colonels 
were killed in this mishap. General Abdulbari, the supreme 
commander of Jumiatul Mujaheddin of Jammu and Kashmir, has 
announced an award of 100,000 rupees and star of bravery medal 
to each of these brave fighters who took part in the devastation 
of Badami Bagh military camp and destruction of military 
vehicles and government buildings. The freedom fighters also 
attacked Galewar cantonment and killed dozens of Indian 
soldiers. In addition to damaging the cantonment, they totally 
destroyed the artillery building. Various militant groups seeing 
the vulnerable situation in occupied Kashmir have accelerated 
their activities. They have demanded that Hazratbal be opened to 
pilgrims now and to stop the present treatment of Kashmir 
people. These organizations have decided to carry out joint 
attacks at many places seeing the vulnerable situation. The 
Indian army is shaken up by these recent attacks and is 
considering increasing its activities against the freedom 
fighters. The curfew restrictions are being increased to make 
the lives of Kashmiri freedom fighters more difficult. Meanwhile 
the Kashmiri freedom fighters have expressed their determination 
to continue their efforts until Kashmir is fully 
liberated.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Anis Qasim, the legal advisor to the </F>
Palestinian delegation, by Mufidah al-Jaza'iriyah; place and 
date not given--first paragraph is AL-SHARQ introduction] 
  [Text] Cairo--The surprises of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement 
have not ceased since its unexpected birth. Implementation of 
the agreement has been suspended and postponed many times. The 
mood has swung sharply from strong optimism about the imminent 
establishment of a Palestinian self-rule authority to despair 
over the fate of the agreement following the Hebron massacre; 
the continuation of the aggressive, racist, Zionist policy; and 
U.S. resolve to erase Jerusalem's Arab character and to make 
Jerusalem Israel's unified capital. Far from the surprises, on 
the other side of the hill, AL-SHARQ met with Dr. Anis Qasim, 
the legal advisor to the Palestinian negotiating delegation. It 
examined with him drafts of the proposed "constitution" of the 
Palestinian self-rule authority scheduled to be established in 
Gaza and Jericho. 
  [al-Jaza'iriyah] We first asked Dr. Qasim whether we needed 
a 
constitutional charter at this stage. He said: 
  [Qasim] I am not yet certain of the answer. The Palestinian 
people are entering an experiment in the unknown in the Oslo 
agreement boat. Its land, as established in this agreement, is 
undefined, contrary to the living, historical reality. Even the 
element of the population and sovereignty are intentionally 
"absent" from this agreement, which is mined with enigmas. There 
can be no talk of a constitutional charter in the clear absence 
of these three elements. 
  The question is, why should the Palestinian people fetter 
themselves in rigid constitutional provisions, for any 
constitutional charter is a social contract. Also, the proposed 
constitutional charter is being recommended to the Palestinian 
people from abroad, whereas it should flow freely from the 
interior. The intifadah is the best indication that the 
intifadah leadership has proved its ability to put social values 
into effect without the so-called Palestinian police, which is 
an innovation that did not find its way into that charter. 
  The third point revolves around the relation between the 
banished authority in the interior and the authority of the PLO 
abroad. This relation is extremely complex in its content and 
applications. Will the Palestinian state declared in Algeria in 
1988 answer to the elected authority in the interior or will the 
latter answer to the former? Or, is there a new formula? Are the 
elected representatives of the national authority equal to the 
appointed members of the National Council abroad? and how? Will 
the PLO sacrifice all of the diplomatic accomplishments it has 
achieved over the past 25 years by committing suicide in the 
elected authority, which has been prohibited from engaging in 
any diplomatic activity or international relations during the 
transitional phase? These are three difficulties that I am 
unable to reconcile or resolve. However, I believe that we must 
stimulate discussion on these issues and resolve the 
contradictions before a constitutional charter is drafted. 
  [al-Jaza'iriyah] However, what are your observations 
regarding the content of the draft constitutional charter to 
which I referred initially? Is it correct that the document is 
tailor-made for Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, as some Palestinian 
politicians maintain? 
  [Qasim] I do not wish to enter into observations regarding 
the provisions of the draft charter. Each provision has its pros 
and cons. The biggest problem regarding constitutional 
provisions is that they must define a vision for the people 
regarding the mapping out of its future. I tend to maintain that 
it may perhaps be more useful for the Palestinians to pursue the 
freedom to experiment, not stipulations that are imposed on 
their experiment. If the PLO leadership wishes use foresight in 
its examination of a method for developing the new entity's 
constitutional status, it must always have in view that it is 
called upon to follow a new norm, constituting a constitutional 
precedent, that enables the Palestinian people to prescribe this 
experiment. The more the experiment expresses the Palestinian 
people's interests and aspirations, the more it will take root 
as a constitutional principle. 
  [al-Jaza'iriyah] Do you mean that you have fears that the 
laws of the Palestinian authority coming from abroad contradict 
and conflict with the aspirations of the Palestinians of the 
interior? 
  [Qasim] Precisely, and I am afraid that we, in our 
forthcoming entity, will repeat the experience of the Third 
World, as represented in the "disengagement" of the executive 
authority at the expense of the legislative and judicial 
authorities, to the degree that the legislative authority 
becomes a hostage of the executive authority's absence. The 
greatest fear faced by the near-term Palestinian future is the 
clash between the Palestinian authority coming from abroad, 
which has flourished by putting on executive muscles and issuing 
executive decisions, and the Palestinian public, which has lived 
in the interior and has made its own laws on an almost daily 
basis in the absence of a national authority. 
  This probable clash will be resolved only through elections 
in which everyone submits to a free electoral process that is 
under international supervision. 
  [al-Jaza'iriyah] Palestinian proponents of democracy fear 
that the elections for the Palestinian authority, which are 
supposed to be held in July 1994, will be postponed. Others fear 
that the elections will be held against the backdrop of an 
election law that would embrace certain political groups or 
forces. What is your comment? What features do you regard as 
appropriate for the crucial elections law? 
  [Qasim] It is essential to hold elections, because the 
process of holding them, particularly general national 
elections, is the first step in building a national authority 
and in demonstrating legal sovereignty. By contrast, I do not 
believe that raising a Palestinian flag or even posting a 
Palestinian policeman at crossings or a joint guard with the 
Israelis is a manifestation of sovereignty. Sovereignty concerns 
the building of institutions, not raising a flag. Elections must 
be held under the supervision of a credible international 
agency. The reason for this proposal is that such supervision 
would prevent control by one party and one leader in the 
upcoming elections. The people must be allowed to vote freely, 
in order to bring to the next legislative authority those people 
who best express the aspirations, interests, concerns, and 
causes of the Palestinian people, who have has suffered directly 
from the occupation. 
  As for the features of the electoral law, the law must be 
selected carefully. In reality, no electoral law is devoid of 
shortcomings. However, our aspiration is that it at least be an 
electoral law that easily accommodates the Palestinian people in 
the interior. 
  [al-Jaza'iriyah] Which is the best system, election by list 
or districts, or a combination thereof as is the case in the 
German system? In other words, would it be preferable to adopt 
the British or American model? 
  [Qasim] Both of these two models have shortcomings. In any 
case, we must establish a law that is devoid of discrimination 
on the basis of religion, guarantee women the right to vote and 
run for office, not divide candidates into Christians and 
Muslims, and lower the voting age to 18. Elections should be 
general and direct. This will preclude groups from controlling 
elections through their material capabilities. In this way, we 
will not fall into the tribulations of a single party, and we 
will protect the people from the intimidation of the Palestinian 
authority and the Israeli authority. 
  [al-Jaza'iriyah] You are among those in charge of framing 
and 
building a democratic union with a view toward a successful 
Palestinian transition from the revolution phase to the state 
phase. Do you believe that this activity can succeed in 
achieving its goals? 
  [Qasim] I believe that the reform movement will be 
significant, provided that two conditions are met. First, its 
base must be in the interior or the occupied territories. 
Second, Palestinian intellectuals and shapers of Palestinian 
public opinion abroad must support reform without hesitation and 
without straddling the fence between the executive authority in 
the PLO and the reform process. I believe that there is a good 
chance for reform to succeed if these two conditions are met. 
Also, Palestinian circumstances, especially in the contest of 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, indicate that reform has 
become vitally necessary. The recent Cairo agreement posed this 
problem in a fundamental way, for it showed that we have no 
negotiating method or strategy. 
  [al-Jaza'iriyah] Apropos the Cairo agreement, what is your 
assessment of it from a legal and political standpoint? 
  [Qasim] The Cairo agreement is one manifestation of the Oslo 
agreement. The Oslo agreement symbolized the Palestinian 
leadership's dilemma in the negotiations. The Cairo agreement is 
one manifestation of this dilemma. The Cairo agreement clearly 
constitutes a first, official, Israeli interpretation of the 
Oslo agreement. The contiguity of the occupied territories is 
broken by the settlements. The Cairo agreement was intended to 
further legitimize this dismemberment. The Gaza Strip has been 
divided into three sections. We are therefore agreeing to 
dismember the occupied territories to a degree that is even 
greater than their current state of dismemberment, in search of 
delusive symbols of sovereignty! 
  [al-Jaza'iriyah] Do you therefore disagree with the view 
that 
the Oslo agreement possesses an automatic mechanism for arriving 
at an independent Palestinian state? 
  [Qasim] Although the Oslo agreement says no to a Palestinian 
state, a state is not built by raising a flag. Nor is it built 
by a policeman at a crossing. The Palestinian state shall be 
built through the establishment of institutions and the popular 
participation of all segments of the Palestinian people for the 
sake of making and implementing decisions. We must avoid symbols 
and emphasize substance. 
  [al-Jaza'iriyah] Did you not once say, at the start, that 
the 
Oslo agreement would not lead to a Palestinian state? 
  [Qasim] I dealt with this agreement as if it were a type of 
fate and divine decree. At the time, I said that the 
Palestinians's mission was to think of a way to get out of the 
dilemma. I believed that popular sovereignty on the ground is 
the building of institutions. It is the only way to change the 
bad reality that the Oslo agreement will entrench. 
  I believe that the greatest danger in the Oslo agreement 
lies 
not so much in what it stipulates, but in what it does not 
stipulate, namely sovereignty. According to my interpretation, 
the Israelis replaced sovereignty with "cooperation and 
coordination" in all aspects of life, as stated in the 
agreement, including land. 
  The legal interpretation of these words is that, at the end 
of the transitional period, the Palestinians will find the 
Israelis having joint sovereignty with them over their land, 
agriculture, water, trade, and everything. 
  [al-Jaza'iriyah] I understand from this that the Oslo 
agreement does not even offer the possibility of a Palestinian 
entity confederated with Jordan. 
  [Qasim] The Oslo agreement eliminated the Arab dimension of 
our cause. This is indicated by the fact that the Arab countries 
began to host Israeli delegations days after the signing of the 
agreement, not after its implementation. We lost the Arab world 
and destroyed its resistance in exchange for the signing without 
implementation. In the Oslo agreement, we are a part and a tool 
in the Zionist enterprise, inasmuch as we--we and the 
Israelis--have taken it upon ourselves to develop the region, 
even though we are not equal partners in this partnership 
process. The Oslo agreement legally and politically precludes 
any type of federation or confederation with Jordan or another 
country. It requires the Palestinians to "coordinate and 
cooperate" primarily with Israel, before Jordan, Syria, Egypt, 
and any other Arab state. 
  [al-Jaza'iriyah] It is rumored in Palestinian circles that 
Chairman 'Arafat has been guaranteed the presidency of Palestine 
up to 2004. Is this true? What is the legal basis of this 
conclusion? 
  [Qasim] The third section of the constitutional charter 
states, in the clause dealing with executive authority (Article 
4 pertaining to the president) that the chairman of the 
executive committee shall be the supreme president of the 
executive authority and exercise the powers established for him 
in the PLO charter and in resolutions of the national and 
central councils and the executive committee, in addition to the 
powers established in this law. Article 6 in the same section 
states that the term of the presidency shall be five years, that 
no person may hold the presidency for more than two consecutive 
terms, and that the first president's first term shall begin as 
of his taking of the oath. 
  Article 12 states that the president shall exercise his 
authorities through resolutions, which he shall issue according 
to the law and legal regulations, and that he is the supreme 
commander of the Palestinian security forces or forces that are 
subject to orders. Consequently, 'Arafat will remain the 
president until 2004 if elections are held this July.

<F P=106> [Article by Ahmad al-'Attar: "Map for Egypt's Small </F>
Industries; Creation of 17 Small Industry Complexes in 
Governorates and New Towns; 525 Million Pounds for Cost of 
Investment in Complexes Which Will Provide 60,000 New Work 
Opportunities; Soft Terms for Acquisition of Industrial Units by 
Small Investors"] 
  [Text] Industry and Mineral Resources Minister Dr. Ibrahim 
Fawzi has asserted that he is currently drafting a small 
industries map that calls for creating small industry complexes 
in all parts of Egypt and that includes 17 complexes in numerous 
governorates and new towns. The investment cost of creating 
these complexes amounts to nearly 525 million pounds. 
  The minister added that this [step] comes within the context 
of the Industry Ministry's interest in making efforts to 
increase small industry activity because it is a main foundation 
for achieving industrial development. Moreover, small industry 
activity will result in increased utilization of numerous raw 
minerals and agricultural materials through the creation of 
small projects to produce a large number of goods. Small 
industries will also help increase cooperation with medium and 
big industries, especially in the exchange of components and 
parts that each of these industries produces. The new complexes 
will also create nearly 60,000 new work opportunities. 
  Dr. Ibrahim Fawzi further added that each small industry 
complex will consist of units, each of which can be used to set 
up a small project. These complexes will be supplied with all 
basic utilities, such as water, sewerage, electricity, and 
roads. Each small investor will be able to acquire one or more 
units, up to a maximum of five units, if he shows that his 
project requires such a number. Facilities will also be provided 
when these units are sold to small investors, including 
application of the installment-payment system and a grace period. 
  Two small industry complexes have already been built, one in 
the town of 10 Ramadan over an area of 88,000 square meters. It 
consists of 296 units and it has cost nearly 20 million pounds. 
The second complex is in the town of Burj al-'Arab, Alexandria 
Governorate. It has been built over an area of 167,000 square 
meters; it consists of 410 industrial units; and it has cost 
nearly 30 million pounds. The minister went on to add that 
preparations are underway to build new small industry complexes. 
  Engineer 'Abd-al-Mun'im Isma'il, chairman of the Industrial 
and Mining Projects Executive Agency, has said that a number of 
projects are under construction in this regard, including a 
small industry complex in al-Sadat Town over an area of 160,000 
square meters. It consists of 384 units and will cost nearly 28 
million pounds. Another complex is under construction in the 
city of Aswan over an area of 54,000 square meters. It will 
consist of 430 units and will cost 19 million pounds. 
  Engineer Isma'il also said that studies have been completed 
on plans to build a number of other small industry complexes and 
that steps are being taken to finance these complexes in 
preparation for building them. These plans include a small 
industry complex in al-Matariyah Town, al-Daqahliyah 
Governorate, over an area of 220,000 square meters. It will 
consist of 416 units and will cost nearly 40 million pounds. 
They also include a complex in the industrial town of the city 
of New Damietta over an area of 62,000 square meters. It will 
consist of 110 industrial units and will cost nearly 13 million 
pounds. The plans further include a complex to be built on an 
area of 127,000 square meters on the east bank of the Nile River 
at a distance of eight km from Bani Suwayf, consisting of 296 
units and costing nearly 32 million pounds; a complex to be 
built over an area of 150,000 square meters at a distance of 12 
km from the new al-Minya Bridge, consisting of 288 units, and 
costing nearly 34 million pounds; and a complex to be built on 
the east bank of the Nile River at a distance of 14 km from 
Asyut Governorate over an area of 143,000 square meters, 
consisting of 258 units and costing nearly 35 million pounds. 
This is in addition to a small industry complex to be built on 
the east side of the Nile River at a distance of eight km from 
Sawhaj Governorate over an area of 160,000 square meters, 
consisting of 340 units and costing 39 million pounds; a complex 
to be built at a distance of 10 km from the Suez Governorate 
over an area of 150,000 square meters, consisting of 354 units 
and costing nearly 40 million pounds; a complex to be built at a 
distance of two km from Tanta, al- Gharbiyah Governorate, over 
an area of 66,000 square meters, consisting of 136 units and 
costing nearly 23 million pounds; and a complex to be built at a 
distance of 29 km from Alexandria Governorate over an area of 
252,000 square meters, consisting of 354 units and costing 
nearly 51 million pounds. Engineer 'Abd-al-Mun'im Isma'il went 
on to add that there are plans being studied to build four other 
small industry complexes, including one in al-'Ubur Town; one in 
Jamsah Town, al-Daqahliyah Governorate; one in Musturud 
industrial zone, al-Qalyubiyah Governorate; and a complex at 
distance of 12 km west of the city of Ismailia.

<F P=106> [Article by Mamduh al-Wali: "Will Investment Funds Compete </F>
With Savings Strategies?"] 
  [Text] Investment funds are new financial vehicles that 
will offer themselves to the public in the coming period. The 
funds seek to invest in securities. 
  Their concept is based on offering the fund's capital to the 
public for general subscription, the fund's capital being 
divided into equal portions, each of which is called a 
certificate of investment. From the amount collected from 
subscriptions to the investment certificates the fund engages in 
trading--buying and selling--securities (bonds and stocks). From 
this operation are realized the fund's profits, which are 
distributed equally to the investment certificates. However, not 
all operations are necessarily profitable: sometimes the fund 
may lose, but the diversity of the securities and the experience 
of the fund managers work to offset the loss through other 
operations. 
  In this way, investment funds are an appropriate, safe 
alternative to investment companies. Investors who do not want 
to deal with banks can invest their money in investment funds, 
which therefore are a strong competitor to the other savings 
vehicles in the banks. 
  As Dr. Mahmud Subh of the 'Ayn Shams business faculty says 
that the size of a fund's profits or losses depends on the 
quality of the securities it holds. Dealing with the funds thus 
is subject to profit and loss. There is no guarantee of a 
definite rate of profit as with bank deposits. However, with the 
increased risk attendant on the acceptance of the principle of 
profit and loss comes the opportunity to realize high rates of 
gain on a certificate's holding--returns much higher than those 
of banks--if good securities are chosen that yield high rates of 
return through capital gains or stock dividends. 
  Now that the funds exist, there is no longer any reason for 
the small investor who knows nothing about how to deal with 
securities to hold back. Specialized management companies will 
study the market for him, determine the condition of companies, 
acquire the securities of good companies, and unload the 
securities of companies that may be face difficulties for long 
periods. 
<H5>  Bank Securities </H5>
  A major problem that will face the funds is the shortage of 
good securities in the market. Currently existing brokerage 
companies and financial portfolio formation companies complain 
of this problem. How much more of a problem there will be with 
the entry of the greater demand that the funds cause! It may 
cause an excessive rise in the price of some securities. 
  Husayn Shukri, a financial expert, says that one should take 
into account some securities already on the market, in addition 
to securities that will be opened to public subscription in 
privatization operations. The cement companies and the 
al-Dakhilah Paints and Iron Company, among others, will be 
offered in coming months. Shares to increase the capital of the 
International Commercial Bank will be delivered to their owners 
soon. All this will increase the supply of securities. The 
market is expanding with an increased volume of supply and an 
increased amount of demand at the same time. 
  Another factor making for an increased supply [of 
securities] 
is that some banks are offering part of their portfolios of 
sluggish securities for circulation. The bank's affiliated fund 
will have priority in taking advantage of some of these 
securities. Farid Ibrahim, vice president of al-Ahli Investment 
Funds Company, notes that over 30 percent of banks' 
assets--those invested in securities--are stagnant. These are 
good securities, but the banks are satisfied with the dividends 
they collect on them. The securities could yield more if the 
banks sold some of them, bought others, and made their portfolio 
circulate, instead of the current tendency to target and hoard 
stocks with current dividends. Some banks have begun to believe 
in circulating their portfolios, instead of hoarding. Al-Ahli 
Bank's portfolio will have a share in the fund's portfolio. 
However, the quality of the security is the first and last 
criterion. 
  Dr. Ahmad Sa'd 'Abd-al-Latif, at Cairo University's school 
of 
business, points to another aspect: legally approved securities 
that have not yet gone on the market. We now have many 
securities according to the laws; yet they are not on the 
market. Law 146 granted joint-stock companies that are not 
subject to the law the right to issue financing instruments. The 
law also allowed the issuance of preferred stocks; the market, 
however, has not seen them. Although one faltering joint 
commercial bank has turned to them to encourage interest in 
subscribing to increase its capital, other companies are in need 
of the same procedure. 
<H5>  There Is a Difference </H5>
  Farid Ibrahim, vice president of al-Ahli Investment Funds 
Company, noted the difference between the funds and investment 
companies, despite the similarity in goals and aims. It is a 
difference in the methods followed. The most prominent of these 
is the principle of asset distribution. When a fund's resources 
are short term, their investment must be short term and highly 
liquid, so that they can be converted into cash quickly, thus 
enabling the investor to withdraw his money at any time. 
Conversely, the investments of investment companies have been 
directed toward such long-term areas as agricultural and 
manufacturing projects and real estate. 
<H5>  Certificate Price and the Small Investor </H5>
  The first fund to offer its certificates will offer them at 
a 
price of 500 pounds per certificate, with a minimum purchase of 
1,000 pounds. This raises the problem of whether the 
certificate's price suits the abilities of the small investors 
whom the fund intends to encourage to deal in securities. Some 
think this price is too high and will prevent the involvement of 
ordinary people--especially young people and government 
employees--who would have been brought in by a lower certificate 
price. 
  Dr. Nadiyah Abu-Fakhrah, of the business administration 
department of 'Ayn Shams University's business school, thinks 
that during the initial phase the ordinary person will not be 
interested in buying investment certificates. Such people turn 
to the postal savings fund. As awareness about investing in 
securities increases, some of these people may turn gradually to 
buying investment certificates. In the first phase, one can 
therefore expect the purchases of investment certificates to be 
concentrated on those who have an awareness about securities 
investments, particularly companies and banks. 
  Dr. Khayri al-Jaziri, a finance teacher at Cairo 
University's 
business school, says that the Egyptian market still lacks 
studies to determine the characteristics of the Egyptian small 
investor and ascertain his financial abilities and what kind of 
investment suits him in terms of liquidity, yield, and degree of 
risk. This is where we should begin. After such studies exist, 
they can be translated into setting the value, type, and 
characteristics of the securities offered, so that they will 
suit the small investor. 
  Dr. Ahmad Sa'd 'Abd-al-Latif thinks that the certificate's 
price is reasonable because one can assume that anyone who 
invests in securities does not need the invested amount for a 
period of time. Thus, if the amount undergoes some losses, they 
will not affect his standard of living, because the money is 
surplus that is not needed for daily expenditures. Thus the sum 
is appropriate. In case the holder of the certificate needs to 
reclaim its value, the value of its yield must exceed the costs 
of his going to the bank and must be suitable for the time in 
which he can reclaim it. The relative greatness of the value 
will also make management operations within the fund easier. 
  Dr. Mahmud Subh of the business administration department of 
'Ayn Shams business school thinks that, if it is merely a matter 
of shifting some of the money of bank depositors, who will shift 
some of their money deposited in the banks to the purchase of 
certificates, we shall not thereby add much to the market. We 
ought to be attracting new money that is outside current bank 
deposits with their accumulated liquidity, so as to expand the 
circle of investment. 
  Many experts think that the time is not right for the 
emergence of the funds. It would be better for the constituent 
factors for their success to be present first, as any failure in 
the first phase will affect the entire experiment. Others think 
we must begin, because we are already late: the picture will 
become clearer with experience; encouraging factors will appear 
that can be used to advantage; and we shall become aware of 
impeding factors, so that they can be remedied. 
  Dr. Ahmad Sa'd 'Abd-al-Latif says that we have a limited 
number of financial analysts--people to provide information 
about stocks for making decisions to buy or sell securities at 
appropriate times. A stock has a cycle of rise and fall, and 
only a financial analyst can know where a stock currently stands 
in this cycle. Only he can predict the directions of stock 
prices. As everyone knows, we do not have studies to predict the 
condition of Egyptian companies. Although accountants currently 
perform the task of financial analysis, they concentrate on past 
information, while analysis requires past, present, and future 
information. Although we have past information, we have a 
shortage of present information and very little future-oriented 
information. 
  Husayn Shukri says that we have financial analysts. Although 
they are accountants by origin, they are being enlisted to serve 
in securities analysis. As for an absence of studies to predict 
securities prices, the funds will attend to this. Companies will 
emerge in the coming period to do research based on their 
successive visits to the companies whose condition they are 
analyzing. In most countries of the world, brokerage firms have 
research departments. With time, this will happen in Egypt. 
  Dr. Khayri al-Jaziri commented that the profession of 
financial analyst does not necessarily require that the analyst 
have a background in accounting, management, or economics. It is 
a profession in which anyone who has the tools can succeed. We 
have a sufficient number of financial analysts in Egypt at the 
present time. 
  The problem lies in the shortage of people who can read 
financial analysis and benefit from its conclusions, so as to 
translate the results of financial analysis into financial 
decisions.

<F P=106> [Article by Mahmud 'Umarah, head of Society of Businessmen: </F>
"Exporting Is Solution--Our Exports From 2 to 10 Billion 
(Dollars): Reality or Illusion?"] 
  [Text] Paris--What a coincidence! One week after we write 
about how exporting is the solution, the government comes out 
with a decision to raise Egyptian exports to 10 billion 
[dollars] in five years--a 500-percent increase in our exports 
over their current value! Is it possible, or just an illusion? 
Is it a dream that can be realized? 
  I immediately say yes. It is no exaggeration to say it is a 
modest figure, compared to what Tunisia, Morocco, and other even 
more backward African countries are realizing. A yield of $10 
billion for Egypt's exports to all the world's markets, while 
Turkey, with a population about equal to Egypt's, exports $16 
billion! Israel, with 5 million people, exports at the rate of 
$12 billion. Singapore, with fewer than 3 million people, 
exported at the rate of $59 billion in 1991. In short, an 
Egyptian citizen exports the equivalent of $72; an Israeli 
citizen 30 times as much, or $2,160; and a citizen of Singapore 
359 times as much, or $25,848. Today we dream of a yield of 
$10.15 billion from Egypt's agricultural, industrial, and 
mineral exports. It must become a reality, for we have no 
choice. All the opportunities and circumstances are favorable 
for us. The markets of the world are around us. Where is the 
problem? 
  What is the solution, so that the dream may become reality, 
not fantasy? 
  First, a ministry for exports, instead of a ministry for 
emigration! If we are serious about the economic reform process, 
want equilibrium in our balance of payments, and are honest in 
what we say about exporting, we must find unconventional 
solutions and apply them quickly. An export ministry in a period 
of five years would create a revolution in thinking and 
procedures. It would present exhaustive studies of all foreign 
markets, their specific requirements, and the taste of consumers 
in them. It would be a ministry to coordinate between those in 
charge of production policies and marketing. It would be a 
budgeted ministry to promote Egyptian products abroad with good 
advertising, elegant catalogues, and participation in all 
international exhibitions. It would even hold its own 
international exhibition, to which it would invite all the 
countries of the world every year. It would be a ministry over 
all our trade offices. Our embassies would assist it with all 
their facilities. Today's wars and tomorrow's policies are 
economic wars and policies. The Egyptian producer abroad is our 
roving ambassador who enters every house. What one export dollar 
can accomplish is hundreds of times more than can be achieved by 
spending on propaganda for Egypt. It would be a ministry with a 
single goal: at least $10 billion a year! 
  Second, production policy and marketing policy! Production 
is 
the starting point. The agencies in charge of agricultural or 
industrial production operate at a distance from those that 
serve exports; there is a complete separation between them. From 
now on there must be coordination between the two policies: for 
production for the domestic market is completely different in 
its specifications and schedules and even in its taste in 
agricultural products. 
  We must produce what foreign markets need on schedules that 
suit those markets and to their specifications and tastes. 
  In the production process one must attend to quality and 
again quality. Quality is the pillar of export and the real 
primary weapon for invading international markets. 
  In short, production policy and export policy must 
complement 
each other. They are two sides of one coin. 
  Third, land, sea, and air transportation! The most important 
problem that faces export in Egypt is finding an appropriate, 
cheap means of transportation--especially air freight. 
  Here the government can play a role in encouraging our 
exports. It can do what Tunisia and Jordan have done by 
subsidizing the transportation process, so that costs can be 
reduced and the Egyptian product can successfully compete in the 
face of other competing products subsidized by their governments. 
  For example, it is proposed that two of Egypt Air's old 
Airbus planes be earmarked for conversion into cargo airplanes. 
Freight charges should not exceed $500 a ton, rather than the 
current $1,000 a ton, for a five-year transition period to 
support exports. 
  As for sea transport, the problem is that all the existing 
companies belong to the public works sector. There is no 
significant competition from private companies that would allow 
the exporter to obtain better prices. Companies in the public 
works sector monopolize the market and impose their own prices, 
which are utterly out of line with their services and 
international market prices that are set by competition and by 
supply and demand--not to mention that there are no regular 
lines to Europe! 
  As for the problem of land transportation, has no one found 
a 
solution for it? Egyptian exporters and products need coolers 
that come from Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon; yet we find that all 
the agencies in Egypt are fighting them! So the freight charge 
for a single cooler from Egypt to Saudi Arabia has risen from 
5,000 riyals to 11,000 riyals, at a time when we are in need of 
a land transportation fleet. 
  The importance of a land transportation fleet will become 
apparent when the internal Middle East market emerges. Everyone 
around us is preparing himself for the wrestling match. Do we 
have to remain spectators and wake up after the last round to 
regret that it is too late and that we have missed another 
opportunity? 
  Fourth, fees and taxes! Exports are more important than the 
investment companies and new development schemes that are given 
a 10-year tax exemption. Export activity should be given a 
five-year exemption from fees or taxes of any kind, except the 
commercial profits tax. The latter is the right of the state and 
country: every citizen who realizes net profits at the end of 
the year must pay the treasury part of his profits for services 
and security. 
  Exempting export activity from the remaining other fees and 
taxes will enable it to compete and enter new markets 
monopolized by countries that are professional at exporting. The 
government takes in no more than 30 million pounds a year from 
all these various fees and taxes. It is a paltry amount in the 
budget, but it affects the competitiveness of companies and 
causes them to waste time dealing with all these 
agencies--particularly the Tax Department! 
  Fifth, the export register! The foundation is the exporter 
himself, with good preparation. There are 20,000 registers that 
have been recorded for exporters; yet only 1,000 exporters are 
active in exporting. The export profession in the past became 
the profession of those who had no profession. 
  Retired senior state employees over 60 and many young people 
who dream of quick wealth imagine they have succeeded simply by 
obtaining an export register. Many of them, one discovers, have 
no experience in any market. One always finds some of them 
venturing to ship products without knowing the risk involved; 
and if one does not know the specifications of the market there, 
or if one has no information and facts about the customer, one 
will waste the expense of the deal and lose everything--and find 
oneself involved with courts and lawyers' offices. How many 
professional swindlers there are in the international markets! 
Their victims are usually from the Third World. 
  Sixth, insurance! This is the role of the Federation of 
Chambers of Commerce in protecting exporters from themselves, 
first, and from professional nonpayers in foreign markets. The 
federation should find a solution with one of the specialized 
insurance companies. It could study drawing up a single policy 
for all exporters recognized by the association. Each exporter 
might pay 1 percent of the volume of his yearly business. The 
exporter would become more courageous and at the same time could 
devote himself to quality, packaging, and marketing. 
  Seventh, financing! Where are the inexpensive sources of 
financing for export activity? As everyone knows, an exporter 
does not collect the price of a deal until one or two months 
after the shipping date. 
  Where is the Exports Bank [Egyptian Export Development Bank] 
headed by Dr. Hazim al-Bablawi, who is an expert of recognized 
ability in the problems of exporters? 
  Finally, we note that during the past seven years the value 
of exports of goods not traditionally exported has increased by 
150 percent. This is a leap and an asset to be credited to 
official and government effort and to businessmen. But by the 
criteria of the challenge, we must achieve the target. The 
government, exporters, other official bodies, as well as 
Egyptian importers overseas must unite their efforts toward this 
goal, so that Egypt can flourish under a bold liberalization 
policy.

<F P=106> [Article by Mustafa 'Abd-al-'Aziz: "250,000 Suspects in </F>
Bribery and Embezzlement Lineup"] 
  [Text] Last year competent agencies investigated 56,000 
bribery and 1,400 embezzlement cases. If only a quarter of these 
crimes are usually reported, this means that every year there 
are more than 250,000 people who take bribes and embezzle. 
  This dangerous phenomenon has recently spread, with the 
number of bribe-takers and embezzlers growing daily. And it is 
not stopping: every day one finds several stories about bribery 
or embezzlement in the newspapers. The number is frightening and 
terrifying, and we do not know how big it will be in a few 
years. Why has the phenomenon spread? How can it be stopped, so 
that the hemorrhaging of public money stops and government 
employees regain their senses, their values, the teachings of 
their religion, and their loyalty to their country? 
  There are so many examples that it is difficult to count and 
list them. They begin with a minor government employee who asks 
for a few pounds as a bribe; they end with a powerful and 
influential senior government employee who also asks for a bribe 
and exploits his power to get it. It is the same with 
embezzlement. It begins with a simple factory worker who 
embezzles a small amount of money; it ends with major embezzlers 
who embezzle thousands and millions. 
  As just one example, none of us can forget the "big fish" of 
Nasr City and what he did with a large number of weak-spirited 
government employees, who wronged innocents, broke the laws, and 
wasted millions of pounds of these people's money. After him 
came "the little fish" (in comparison with the size of the big 
fish's misdeeds), and they also cost the people of Egypt 
millions in losses through bribery and embezzlement. 
  A few days ago, the newspapers published two embezzlement 
stories on a single page. 
  The first was "the arrest of the administrative head of 
Central al-Jizah District on a charge of bribery and misuse of 
influence." 
  The second story was "a bank employee squanders 1.25 million 
pounds." When will the phenomenon end? 
  Who will stop the hemorrhaging of public money. Who will 
prevent the loss of millions and of values and principles? Who? 
  Bribery has become endemic in government agencies in our 
country. It is a phenomenon that constitutes a chronic 
disease--thus states the lawyer Ahmad 'Awdah. He adds: "It is an 
intractable disease, a malady that spreads and worsens every 
day. The situation now pleases no one. Those in need or 
requesting a service--the interested parties--get no results 
without somehow paying a bribe to 'Zayd or 'Amr.' There is no 
longer any business done anywhere without bribery or at least 
favoritism or influence peddling. In all cases the Egyptian 
citizen is the victim. Having admitted the existence of this 
sickness and vicious malady, legislation has not succeeded in 
eliminating it. In the past, bribery was a misdemeanor. Now it 
has become a felony with a deterrent punishment. Yet despite the 
increased penalty, the unfortunate phenomenon is becoming more 
and more common and the disease unfortunately is spreading. 
Toughening or increasing the penalty won't accomplish anything. 
Watching and oversight have accomplished nothing, because the 
watchdog or oversight agencies cannot hire a guard or policeman 
to stand next to every employee. What one can say is that the 
source of the problem is lack of integrity, ethical corruption, 
collapse of social values, and a weak religious conscience. 
Moreover, complaints against a government employee receive no 
attention. Complaints no longer avail because the official's 
superior does not side with the aggrieved citizen, but flatters 
the employee at the expense of the truth. In the end the citizen 
finds himself forced to pay." 
  As for crimes of embezzlement, Ahmad 'Awdah points out that 
they are a betrayal of trust by an employee who is in charge of 
a public work or holds a deposit of money or goods in trust. 
"The betrayal in this case is considered a crime in the eyes of 
the law. Its punishment in government agencies is that of a 
felony. In nongovernment agencies it is a misdemeanor. 
Nevertheless, increasing the punishment will not succeed. 
Instead, we need to awaken the conscience, which in some people 
has died, in others has gone to sleep, and in yet others has 
become shaky. Can we awaken consciences and again stimulate the 
religious sense, the fear of God, and awareness of God's 
oversight in matters private and public? I hope so, though I 
think it will be hard to accomplish." 
  Chief appeals court judge Khalifah al-Juyushi says: "Section 
103 of the Penal Code stipulates that any public employee who 
asks for himself or another, or who accepts or takes a promise 
or the offer of a gift for the performance of any part of his 
duty, shall be considered to have taken a bribe and shall be 
punished by hard labor for life and a fine not under 1,000 
pounds or over the amount he was given or promised. The criminal 
law concerning this item is not in need of change. The causes of 
bribery can be traced basically to weakness of the religious 
conscience, as well as the country's economic crisis and 
inflation. The bribe-taker is someone psychologically prepared 
to do so. The government needs to hold training courses for 
employees before they take up their duties. The information 
media has a large role to play in the phenomenon--television, 
radio, and newspapers. In this way, public employees will be 
ready to carry out the responsibilities of their positions. An 
attempt also must be made to solve our economic problems, 
especially unemployment." 
  As for the law and punishment for bribery, they are quite 
sufficient and do not need to be increased or made more 
stringent. Section 102 of the Penal Code stipulates that any 
public employee who embezzles funds, papers, or anything else 
found in his possession by virtue of his position shall be 
punished by a term at hard labor. The punishment is hard labor 
for life in the following cases: 
  1. If the offending official is a local tax collector, his 
representative, a trustee for deposits, or a cashier who has 
been entrusted with money in that capacity. 
  2. If the crime of embezzlement is intrinsically connected 
to 
the crime of falsification or using a falsified document. 
  3. If the crime is committed in wartime and entails damage 
to 
the country's economic position or national interest. 
  In my opinion, the problem is deficient religious 
conscience, 
as well as the grinding economic crisis. Also, there are the 
offender's own tendencies or psychological disposition before he 
commits the crime of bribery or embezzlement. 
  Major General Faruq Hafiz, director of the department that 
investigates the implementation of sentences, says: "This 
problem and these figures do not constitute a phenomenon and 
should not disturb us. This is because the number of people who 
accept bribes or embezzle is insignificant in comparison with 
the population--about four per thousand. Human beings have 
produced crime since Cain and Abel. It diminishes or increases 
depending on apprehension and combat. Embezzlers have existed in 
every age and time at home and abroad. If there really is any 
phenomenon, it is the increased apprehension of crimes. This is 
a healthy phenomenon in the fight and a sure sign that the 
agencies are combatting crime. Moreover, crime is connected to 
social factors. The social factors in turn are connected to the 
conscience and an ethical revival. Embezzling is not related to 
the question of riches and poverty. A rich man is one who is 
rich in spirit, not rich in money. The large number of 
apprehensions should be credited to the government's oversight 
and regulatory agencies, which have indeed engaged in 
apprehension." Major General Faruq Hafiz added: "The crime of 
accepting bribes or embezzling has its causes. Sometimes it is 
the citizen who pays the government employee and presents 
bribery or embezzlement to him in a favorable light. We must not 
forget to emphasize that values have changed with the passage of 
time. Crime in all its forms will surely continue as long as 
there are human beings. The important thing is to fight it. 
Thank God the fight is going on and is strong!" 
  Assistant interior minister Major General 'Adil al-Nahhas 
emphasizes that these numbers do not constitute a significant 
phenomenon compared to the population. It is an individual 
phenomenon involving certain weak-spirited employees. One cannot 
generalize from them to the great majority of honest government 
employees. We hear and read about the exceptions. There are 
employees who hold sensitive leadership posts, and we have heard 
nothing to cast opprobrium on them. Cases of embezzlement occur 
not only in Egypt; individual cases of corruption come to light 
in all countries of the world.

  [Text] There are serious questions on what is the right and 
successful approach to deal with and overcome the worsening 
conditions in some public business sector companies. There are 
questions on how to eliminate the bottleneck that is embodied in 
reduced economic efficiency and in loss of the ability to 
overcome financial, administrative, organizational, production, 
and marketing problems, strangleholds, and obstacles in most 
public business sector companies. How can these problems be 
eliminated so as to achieve the desired reform and so holding 
companies and subsidiaries can move forth and keep pace with the 
economic awakening that is underlined by the public policies and 
by the development and growth strategies? 
  Regarding an urgent prescription for reform and cure, 
AL-USBU' AL-IQTISADI [Economic Weekly] has interviewed 
accountant Muhammad al-Shaykh, executive vice chairman of the 
Chemical Industries Holding Companies. Al-Shaykh has emphasized 
a main fact that he believes is extremely significant and 
without which it will be difficult to accomplish the desired 
leap. This fact is connected with the inevitability of a prompt 
evaluation of the capability of all leaders of holding and 
subsidiary public business sector companies. This evaluation has 
to be made according to scientific, sophisticated, and 
unconventional criteria in order to measure accomplishment and 
lack of accomplishment and so as to replace all leaders who have 
not accomplished and who have not been able to rise to the level 
demanded by the phase calling for a fundamental reform of the 
conditions. The call for comprehensive change is not connected 
with individuals. It is connected primarily to modern and 
sophisticated selection criteria that focus on new and vigilant 
leaders who possess scientific and technical ability; who have 
international and domestic experience; who are capable of 
advanced modern management; who have the potential for creative 
initiatives; and who will shoulder the responsibility of 
building for the future. This requires opening the way for a new 
generation of leaders who believe that their future is tied to 
effective and serious reform and that success is the only means 
to prove their existence, to survive, and to participate 
effectively in building for long periods to come. 
  On the basis of his long financial experience in drafting 
and 
reviewing the state's general budget and of the budgets and 
plans of the industry sector and of public business sector 
companies, accountant Muhammad al-Shaykh notes that the problems 
existing in holding and subsidiary companies are of extremely 
great dimensions and that a large part of these problems is the 
legacy of long years of faulty policies and of procrastination 
in implementing a comprehensive reform program. But the 
immensity of the problems does not at all mean that reform is 
impossible or unlikely. It means primarily that reform needs 
leaders who are highly aware of the problems and of the numerous 
solutions to deal with the problems according to the new 
conditions and circumstances and according to policies that are 
based on free economy and market economics--policies that are 
very far from the conventional concepts that have dominated the 
system of management and of dealing with the public business 
sector for long years. This means that there is a need to 
replace the administrative concepts and to enlist the help of 
leaders capable of responding and clinging to, embracing, and 
implementing the new concepts. This is because the 
administrative concepts that existed prior to the liberation of 
the public business sector companies are not fit or beneficial. 
The conventional pattern of ministerial intervention and the 
adoption of executive decrees to bolster reform are no longer 
adequate, absolutely. Reform is bolstered soundly by that which 
emanates from within the holding companies and subsidiaries and 
from the possibilities of exploiting the available resources and 
capabilities with a mentality based on dealing with the market 
challenges, on competition, and on the new methods to confront 
problems. This mentality makes it possible for every company to 
overcome its negative conditions and to move to new and much 
better conditions. This mentality achieves reform for the 
companies and, at the same time, achieves the desired reform of 
the general economic structure. Because of the enormous total 
size of the public business sector, especially of the 
production, construction, and building sections and of most of 
the vital service sections, reforming this sector will certainly 
reflect very positively on the economic situation generally and 
will inevitably provide positive indicators that support the 
comprehensive reform program. These indicators will bolster the 
program, accelerate its steps, reinforce its successes, banish 
many mistaken and faulty concepts from the national economy's 
management, and enhance the capability and efficiency of this 
management. 
  Accountant Muhammad al-Shaykh proposes the introduction of 
prompt amendments to the executive bylaws of the public business 
sector companies so as to achieve a fundamental change in the 
structure of holding companies' boards of directors and so that 
vice chairmen will be appointed to these boards. This is because 
in all holding companies, the position of executive board 
chairman has been combined with the position of commissioned 
board member, thus making it possible to determine clearly the 
responsibility for managing the holding company's executive work 
and giving the commissioned member the opportunity to 
participate in the executive board as an original member. This 
combining of positions also underlines the importance of 
preparing the periodic reports stipulated in the executive 
bylaws on the positions of the public business sector companies 
and the importance of submitting these reports to the Cabinet 
regularly through the public business sector minister. The 
submission of these periodic reports offers the Cabinet a 
constant opportunity to familiarize itself with these companies' 
problems, to debate them, and to make the necessary decisions on 
them. The various ministries should be made partly responsible 
for [implementing] these decisions so there will be no delay in 
reform and in dealing with problems. The reports also offer the 
Cabinet a full opportunity to familiarize itself with 
deficiencies and flaws and with excesses and violations. They 
give the public business sector minister the opportunity to 
confront problems and to introduce the necessary changes among 
leaders and the necessary amendments to rules and regulations. 
The [new] rules and regulations are still not enacted even 
though they are necessary and important for creating the desired 
climate to enhance work efficiency, to free bureaucratic work, 
and to enhance the level of organization and management. 
Enacting the rules and regulations will ensure that the spirit 
of the business sector law is achieved. It will also guarantee 
the effective implementation of this law's objectives. To date, 
the real situation falls far short of approaching and 
accomplishing these objective capably and effectively.

  [Text] Many questions are raised in the Egyptian society 
about the future of Egyptian industry. This questioning is due 
to the economic reform and the changes taking place in the 
Egyptian arena, the most important of which are privatization 
and trade liberalization. It is also due to the new factors that 
make industrial cooperation with the outside world imperative. 
In addition, goals for increased exports present the best means 
to both increase industrial activity and apply the latest 
industrial technologies. 
  Though the ferromanganese industry, which is one of the 
Egyptian strategic industries, lay idle for many years, millions 
of pounds have been invested in it. Major and important changes 
have taken place in this industry leading to major problems 
which are currently related to keeping pace with the 
international demand for its products of ferromanganese and 
meeting its exports obligations. This change has come about 
because of sound economic management. This management is based 
on acquiring information and conducting export-related studies, 
which consider competition and market study in order to achieve 
its goals. In fact, since the Sinai Manganese Company made use 
of market and scientific studies, as well as international 
periodical newsletters that deal with this industry, it is no 
longer isolated from international markets and has started 
penetrating them. The successful results that this company has 
met with prove that, with regard to the public sector, these 
results are due to the sound economic policy adopted by the 
Sinai Manganese Company. Such a policy takes into account and 
closely monitors the different economic changes that effect 
production and export. It also advocates good quality and stands 
for competition, especially at the present stage. The Sinai 
Manganese Company has successfully applied this strategy. 
Engineer Muhammad Hasan 'Id, the company chairman and executive 
officer, initiated this policy and has worked diligently to 
apply it. His efforts made it possible for the company to export 
to Japan, Germany, and other countries. Engineer 'Id's strategy 
and efforts also rendered good results in marketing the 
company's other products in the domestic market. What are the 
landmarks of the Sinai Manganese Company's economic and 
production strategy within the framework of existing 
investments, particularly relating to meeting its urgent 
marketing demands and taking into consideration that the 
company's vital investments lie in the ferromanganese industry? 
  We met with engineer Muhammad Hasan 'Id, chairman and 
executive officer of the company, in order to become acquainted 
with the new path of the ferromanganese industry in both world 
and domestic markets. Engineer 'Id stated with clear and precise 
words that could be considered important economic indicators, 
that: "Currently, we are concerned with meeting the European 
markets' demands especially in view of the uneconomic work 
conditions existing in the ferromanganese factory now operating 
at capacity. There should be quick new investments to meet the 
demands of urgent exports. The current export schedule is a 
continuation of past exports. This condition is due to the fact 
that contracts for ferromanganese exports are made at 
three-month intervals. Prices are stabilized throughout each of 
these periods. This short contracting period has the advantage 
of allowing for an increase in prices every three months." 
Engineer 'Id also indicated that: "The company's export goals 
are based on both its export potential and the economic gains 
from exports." He further stated that the Sinai Manganese 
Company has unlimited demands for its exports. 
<H5>  The Ferromanganese Industry's World Market: Factors the </H5>
Company Should Consider Regarding Competition 
  Because our conversation with engineer 'Id covered the world 
market and rising exports, it was inevitable that we discuss the 
factors that the Company considered that allowed it to enter the 
world market. The chairman and executive officer of the Company 
responded to our inquiry by saying: "In order for the company 
just to enter the ferromanganese world market, we had to adopt a 
graduating pricing strategy that started with a price that was 
5-percent lower than the world market price. However, we offered 
this lower price for a limited period only in order to make sure 
that our company entered in competition with other companies. In 
the meantime, we studied all the information relevant to 
movement in these world markets. 
<H5>  Actual Export Figures </H5>
  The chairman and executive officer of the Sinai Manganese 
Company reported that in 1993 the company had exported more than 
10,000 tons of ferromanganese worth $4 million. The Company is 
expected to export more than 15,000 tons in 1994. 
<H5>  Gypsum Ore and Calcified Gypsum: Production and Exports </H5>
Capacities 
  Besides the ferromanganese project, in the framework of a 
policy of harmonized production, the Sinai Manganese Company is 
also producing gypsum ore and calcified gypsum. Engineer 'Id 
remarks: "There is no problem exporting gypsum ore, because the 
Company has exporting contracts in 1993/94 to export 60,000 tons 
to the Arab Gulf region. Meanwhile, the Company has already 
exported gypsum ore worth $500,000. In addition, it exported 
20,000 tons of sand for glass to the European market in 1993/94. 
Actual sales of calcified gypsum were 120,000 tons, which 
represented 40 percent of the factory's capacity." At this 
point, engineer 'Id raised a vital point about which he had been 
thinking, namely that of changing the activity of the factory in 
order to make use of its potential and its workers. It is worth 
mentioning that, since restarting operation of the 
ferromanganese factory and the manganese mines, the number of 
workers in the Company has increased to 300. 
<H5>  Capital, Investment, Role Demanded and Workers' Share </H5>
  It is necessary to reform the financial structure of the 
Sinai Manganese Company in order to make it capable of meeting 
its industrial, strategic, and vital goals. These reforms are 
necessary for many reasons. Among these reasons is the fact 
that, since the world market--particularly the markets of Europe 
and the Arab Gulf--have opened to the Company's ferromanganese 
and gypsum exports, there have been changes in the Company's 
patterns of production and exports. The Company also has other 
potential, such as its port, which is currently busy for 30 days 
[as published; probably should read "300 days per year"]--a 
great success for all workers. The different categories of 
workers appreciate the rise in the Company's exports. As a 
result of these changes, though the Company's invested capital 
remains fixed at 10 million pounds, its projects are valued at 
220 million pounds: therefore there is the need to reform the 
Company's financial structure, as was mentioned above. Engineer 
'Id believes that, in order for the Company to meet its 
industrial, strategic, and vital goals, it is necessary to 
reform the Company's financial structure. In short, these 
reforms are rescheduling the Company's loans, and making them 
long-term loans with low interest rates as well as having the 
Investment Bank contribute to the Company's capital. Currently, 
35 pounds are paid as interest for every ton of calcified 
gypsum, the price of which is 80 pounds, and 380 pounds are paid 
as bank interest for every ton of ferromanganese. Engineer 'Id 
adds: "We have already asked the holding company to raise the 
Company's capital to 60 million pounds in order to achieve a 
balance between actual investment and current export 
expectations, which are embodied in privatization, trade 
liberalization, and the recent agreements."

<F P=106> [Article by Rafi' al-Falahi: "Question to United Nations: </F>
Who Violates UN Resolutions; 1,318 Days of Blockade; They Have 
Blockaded Iraq and Reaped Frustration; They Will Lose"] 
  [Text] The enemies' lies, their feeble pretexts, and their 
policies to dominate all peoples who respect their "bread" and 
who preserve their dignity have fallen as tree leaves fall in 
autumn when they are shaken by the wind. A total of 1,318 days 
of the tyrannical blockade imposed on the Iraqi people has 
passed, pulling away the masks and exposing the real faces 
behind them. The roles of many of the "minor forces" have been 
exposed. These forces have colluded with the "major powers" and 
have dropped the world into a maelstrom of bribery, corruption, 
intrigue, sabotage, and premeditated murder, thus turning the 
days since 6 August 1990 to this day into phases soaked with the 
blood of the Iraqi people and with their steadfastness in the 
face of an unjust blockade. This blockade has blackened the 
history of all those who claim to be civilized and humane and 
who preach justice and the right of peoples to live honorably 
and peacefully. 
  Since the enemies imposed their tyrannical blockade, the 
Iraqi people have become accustomed to the "farcical review" 
that takes place whenever the Security Council holds its 
"sessions" to debate lifting the blockade imposed on their 
country and to examine the provisions of the unjust resolutions. 
In these sessions, the U.S. and British representatives 
alternate roles ordinarily, and the other members tag behind, 
one time with threats and another with inducements. The same 
"cliche" that is announced by the Security Council every two 
months is proclaimed anew, namely that Iraq defies Security 
Council resolutions and international consensus and is 
determined not to carry out its obligations! What follows is a 
resolution to carry on with the blockade imposed on Iraq. As for 
the Iraqi people's hardship: the sick who seek drugs and 
children whom death snatches by the thousands because they 
cannot find milk, medicine, or food to keep the ghost of death 
away; as for the "unjust" resolutions that Iraq has implemented; 
as for the facilities Iraq has offered, and the cooperation Iraq 
has shown to all UN committees, including the "inspection 
teams"--cooperation shown despite the "arrogance" and the 
"disdain" displayed by many of these teams, which are often 
supported by CIA officers, such as U.S. Intelligence Officer 
David Kay, Karen Jansen, the woman who initiated the Department 
of Agriculture crisis, her colleague, Mark Silver, and 
others--as for all this, it has no place in the Security 
Council's calculations, thanks to the power of the Americans and 
the British who run this council and who do not see any ethical 
or legal motive to lift the blockade against Iraq. 
  What is Iraq required to do in order to persuade the 
Security 
Council to lift the blockade? 
  The answer demands more than a pause to recall numerous 
junctures of the course of Iraq's relations with the Security 
Council and to underline the goals of the 30-state aggression 
against Iraq and the ability of the Iraqi people to stand fast 
and firm in their national battle. 
  To begin, one must say that U.S. domination of the UN 
Security Council is the seat of the malady. This council, which 
came into existence initially to be the refuge for every needy 
and the supporter of every oppressed, has turned with time into 
a mere caretaker of the U.S., Zionist, and imperialist 
interests. This council waits for its resolutions to come from 
the U.S. Department of State because it is an agency that 
follows this department loyally. When the aggression against 
Iraq started with the ill-reputed blockade Resolution 661 of 6 
August 1990, the Security Council was declaring very explicitly 
and openly its full alignment with the U.S.-Zionist scheme to 
strike Iraq, to kill its people, and to destroy all that the 
Iraqi people had accomplished economically, politically, and 
scientifically. Perhaps what happened during the military 
aggression against Iraq is the best proof of the ugly 
exploitation of the Security Council which issued the official 
resolution authorizing the aggression states to use all the 
means of death, devastation, and destruction invented by their 
sick minds to damage gravely 84 percent of Iraq's infrastructure 
with 88.5 million kg of explosives dumped on Iraq during 1,008 
hours of uninterrupted military aggression. Their main goal was 
to destroy whatever pertains to life on Iraq's soil. 
<H5>  What Do They Want? </H5>
  Again, we return to the question: what do the Americans want 
of Iraq and what does the Security Council want in order to lift 
the blockade? 
  The facts assert that the United States has used the 
Security 
Council to implement its evil schemes from the time the blockade 
was imposed and throughout the subsequent phases of aggression 
that followed, and up to this day. Perhaps, a review of some of 
what happened between the council and Iraq will clarify the 
premeditated schemes against Iraq. 
  At the outset, they said that Iraq had to implement 
Resolution 687 on the destruction of weapons and that the 
Security Council would then implement what is required of it, as 
shown by paragraph 22 of the said resolution which calls for 
lifting the blockade against the Iraqi people as soon as it is 
determined that Iraq has implemented the other paragraphs of the 
resolution. Ambassador Rolf Ekeus came repeatedly to Iraq (as an 
envoy of the UN secretary general and as chairman of the special 
committee) to supervise personally Iraq's implementation of this 
resolution. He acknowledged repeatedly in July 1993 Iraq's 
implementation of 95 percent of the resolution. Ekeus also 
asserted through the committees he supervises that Iraq is free 
of plants that produce "chemical weapons" and that it has no 
capability to produce "biological weapons." But what was 
happening at the Security Council? 
  The council was listening to none of this. In every meeting 
it held (every two months) to debate lifting the blockade 
against Iraq, it extended the blockade, alleging that Iraq had 
not adhered to the resolution. When they found that clinging to 
the same cliche became laughable, they said that Iraq had to 
implement Resolution 715 on future inspection and followup. To 
create tension, last July they sent an inspection team led by 
U.S. Intelligence Officer Mark Silver who sealed with red wax 
two Iraqi plants that produce missiles within the permitted 
range. They then proceeded to allege that Iraq rejects future 
observation. At this point, the enemies' preparation to launch a 
new aggression against Iraq had been completed. So, Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf notified the Security Council 
through a documented letter that Iraq does not reject the 
principle of future inspection in accordance with Resolution 687 
but that it awaits the Council's acknowledgment of its rights 
that are stipulated in the same resolution, in paragraph 22 
specifically. These rights are supposed to lead to lifting the 
blockade against Iraq when it implements the provisions of this 
resolution, and Iraq has done so. 
  Ekeus returned to Iraq to "contain the crisis" they 
fabricated. He made statements in Baghdad before Arab and 
foreign media, asserting his full conviction that Iraq had 
adhered to Resolution 687 and saying that he would submit a 
report to that effect to the Security Council so it would 
consider lifting the blockade. But barely had Ekeus arrived in 
Bahrain when he made statements contradicting what he had said 
in Baghdad. So, the Security Council continued to reiterate the 
same phrases about Iraq's failure to adhere to its resolutions, 
thus supporting statements made by U.S. and British officials 
(Clinton, Christopher, John Major, Douglas Hurd, and others). 
<H5>  Fallen Goals </H5>
  Meanwhile, Iraqi diplomacy moved along more than one axis to 
explain the true nature of the matter and to expose the Security 
Council's false allegations and its procrastination in 
implementing what is required of it, considering that Iraq has 
fulfilled all its obligations. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz 
went again to the United Nations and explained in a detailed and 
precise manner all that could possibly reflect the true picture 
of the situation. "Specialized technical" Iraqi delegations did 
the same. Thus, it was time to compel the Security Council to 
welcome Iraq's approval of the resolution on future observation. 
Ekeus came to Iraq again and said afterward: we have discussed 
everything and nothing noteworthy is left. So, what should the 
Security Council have done? Is it not its duty to issue a 
resolution lifting the blockade? 
  What is the U.S. and British goal behind the continued 
fabrication of crises between Iraq and the United Nations, and 
what is the objective of their subsequent threat (and then 
execution of the threat) to make their evil alliance strike Iraq 
again (which it did in two repeat aggressions)? 
  The answer can be concluded by defining the U.S.-Zionist 
objectives behind the 30-state aggression against Iraq: 
  First, the aggression sought to tell Iraq, and through it 
the 
Arab nation and all peoples aspiring for the independence of 
their political and economic decisionmaking, that the 
U.S.-Zionist-Western alliance is an alliance that possesses 
enough power to deter whoever tries to deviate from this 
alliance's policies and to stray from serving the 
"U.S.-Zionist-Western" interests, which according to their 
allegation guarantee world stability. These allegations have 
been proved false beyond the shadow of a doubt, especially since 
the aggression against Iraq and the subsequent U.S. unilateral 
control of the world. This aggression has been followed by the 
Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia issues, by the U.S.-drafted 
Gaza-Jericho accords, and by the subsequent procrastination in 
acknowledging the Palestinian people's rights. 
  Second, the U.S. political ruse has been exposed. The 
Western 
media has tried to promote this ruse, which is embodied in the 
attempt to incite the Iraqi people against their national 
leadership and to separate the Iraqi leadership from its people 
during the "direct" military aggression, during the phase of 
treason and treachery, and during the continued blockade. 
Whoever acquaints himself with the dimensions of the destruction 
that has hit the Iraqi people's homes and factories and all 
their cultural and scientific accomplishments realizes without 
any doubt that the Iraqi people are the target of all phases of 
the aggression. 
  Third, the Iraqi people's realization that the blockade will 
not be lifted by a resolution as long as the objectives of the 
aggression remain unaccomplished has driven the enemies to 
"employ their malice in all kinds of ways." From time to time, 
they have confronted the world with new demands not mentioned in 
Security Council resolutions. When they encounter an Iraq 
standing fast in their faces, they begin to reiteterte, "Iraq 
wants to test our resolve. It is still far from implementing the 
Security Council resolutions." But the world has realized that 
these allegations are false and illegitimate. What Iraq has not 
agreed to is to be divided into three parts, which is what the 
enemies want to do with central and southern Iraq now that 
circumstances have helped them spread their control over 
northern Iraq, where this control can never last. What Iraq has 
not agreed to are the ill-reputed latitudes and longitudes, and 
Iraq has the right to defend its soil and to protect its borders. 
  As our Leader President Saddam Husayn said in his historic 
speech on occasion of the 73d anniversary of our valiant army, 
the main reason that will lead to ending the blockade is that 
the "deluded who are embroiled in treason and whose eyes have 
been blinded by transgression imagine that lifting the blockade 
against Iraq is a malicious political game or a lowly diplomatic 
act which can be obstructed with bribery and with the illicit 
spending of money. These people do not realize that the main 
reason that will lead to ending the blockade is the Iraqi 
people's steadfastness, their firm belief in their principles 
and rights, their adherence to honor and virtue, and their 
loyalty to their noble national, pan-Arab, and human goals." 
<H5>  They Are Aware of Their Frustration </H5>
  In an endeavor to discover the secret behind Iraq's 
steadfastness and behind the failure of the objectives of the 
aggression, the U.S. Department of Defense assigned Patrick 
Clawson [name as transliterated], a strategic researcher, to 
study the effects of the economic blockade on Iraq. Clawson's 
conclusion was that Iraq has succeeded in achieving some sort of 
economic stability without giving up its national pride. In an 
endeavor to answer the question of how Iraq has been able to 
accomplish this, Paul Lewis, a well-known U.S. journalist, said 
in an article published in the NEW YORK [reference not verified] 
some time ago that it is the Iraqi genius that has culminated 
not only in digging a 565-km river but also in rebuilding all 
that was destroyed and adding new structures and projects and, 
moreover, in Iraq's ability to provide a security net for every 
Iraqi family by distributing a reasonable amount of foodstuffs 
that meet survival needs. 
  Is it reasonable that the international community should 
continue to deal with a deep-rooted people such as the Iraqi 
people in the poor manner the U.S. administration wants to 
perpetuate? 
  The facts concluded from the actual developments that have 
occurred from since the military aggression was launched against 
Iraq to this day; our leadership's awareness of dimensions of 
the ceaseless battle against the enemies; and this leadership's 
constant educating of the people with what the various phases of 
the aggression entail have strengthened the calm Iraqi logic, 
turning it into a clear method which deals with the facts most 
precisely and in a manner that serves Iraq's steadfastness. All 
this has made the world realize that Iraq can never be a 
meaningless figure. The legal justifications for a continued 
blockade against Iraq have fallen. Here is France, which took 
part in the alliance of aggression against Iraq, affirming these 
days through a number of its officials, including Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe, that Iraq has made great progress in 
implementing UN resolutions. At the same time, French political 
and information circles assert that France, along with a number 
of Security Council members (China, Russia), does not want the 
United Nations to invent new obstacles every time Iraq surpasses 
an old obstacle. Numerous diplomats accuse the White House of 
promoting these actions, which will inevitably encourage French 
and European leaders to look for new horizons through which to 
approach Iraq and its national issues, dealing with it at least 
from the perspective of their national interests, which have 
been harmed greatly by the blockade and the continued aggression 
against Iraq. 
<H5>  Blockade Will Not Last </H5>
  Now, with the Security Council scheduled to debate the 
continued blockade against Iraq in a couple of days, what more 
can we say? 
  The truth is that even if U.S. policy manages to extend the 
blockade for another period, the ultimate outcome will confirm 
that the blockade has begun to narrow, to vanish, and to be 
destroyed, especially since the world has realized that Iraq has 
not stood idle throughout the past period of the unjust 
blockade, which had been planned to kill Iraq's people with 
starvation and disease, and since the world has also realized 
that Iraq can do a lot to confront any new imperialist step that 
adds another lock to the doors of the tyrannical blockade. The 
doors of hope are as open to the Iraqi people today as they have 
never been open in any of the 1,318 days of the blockade. 
Through their action against the aggression and the continued 
blockade, the Iraqi people can teach the enemies lesson after 
lesson in the battle to end the tyrannical blockade and to 
regain their distinguished role in life now that their country 
has remained united and strong despite all the means of 
treachery, aggression, and oppression used by the enemies 
against this country. The milk embargo against Iraq's children; 
the drug embargo against Iraq's patients, and the bread embargo 
against Iraq's citizens will not last. All those who prevent the 
Security Council from fulfilling its obligations to Iraq "will 
reap the results of their ridiculous and malicious positions," 
as Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz asserted a few days ago.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadia Shakkarah: "The Law of Supply and Demand </F>
Lopsided in Our Markets"] 
  [Text] You hardly believe your eyes as you step with your 
right foot (not the left one) into the area of 'Alawi Jamilah: 
winding markets and plentiful supplies of various products and 
foods. Let your eyes wander where they please (it costs nothing) 
but don't touch because the high prices will burn you. 
  Prices rise daily in a wild constant climb. There is no 
better proof of that than a simple comparison between the prices 
shown here and their level by the time this newspaper reaches 
you. 
<H5>  Iraqis Dislike Baqla' [beans]? </H5>
  As we wandered those markets in search of "Why" and "Who Is 
Responsible," we attempted to get to know the wholesalers whose 
stores were bursting with goods. We wanted to determine the 
reason. 
  We began on the inside of a large store where 50-kilogram 
sacks were stacked at the entrance. On examining their contents, 
some of which were scattered on the floor, we found them to be 
filled with Baqla'--rotten Baqla'. 
  The owner said: "They have spoiled after being held in 
storage for a long time because they are hard to sell in our 
markets. Iraqis do not like to eat Baqla' and I'll be forced to 
sell it as animal fodder." 
  That was news to me! I must have outdated information on the 
Iraqi's favorite dish, which is famous among the Arabs and the 
rest of the world (Baqla' dishes with bread and butter, etc.). 
  "Why don't you admit that it is the high price that keeps 
the 
citizenry from buying?" The storekeeper vehemently objected: "I 
sell it for 15 dinars [ID] a kilo, which is a fair price." 
  I interrupted: "But it is sold at retail for ID25 a kilo and 
maybe even more!" 
  "I did not know that." 
  "Really?" 
  "Maybe I knew but that is the retailer's business. I sell to 
both wholesalers and retailers and I don't tell what prices to 
charge for what they buy from me." 
  "Is there great disparity between retail markups and yours?" 
  He responded after a period of silence: "That is why I quit 
this business of selling basic foodstuffs such as rice and oils, 
because it costs me too much. The price of the dollar is 
inconstant, so I am engaged these days in trading red peppers 
and cereals. I make a reasonable profit from selling peppers to 
plants which make spices and seasonings!" 
  At that point his partner wondered when the banks would make 
dollars available and said that he makes daily trips to 
authorized banks in order to buy dollars. 
  We asked: "What do you want with dollars? You are now 
trading 
in cereals, which are locally produced, aren't they?" 
  The answer was: "True, but we need dollars to facilitate our 
operations a bit." 
<H5>  When the Eggs Hatch </H5>
  You cannot see the market floor because of the egg crates 
stacked on it. You practically trip on them! Most egg peddlers 
are women. Asked the price of a carton of eggs today, they said: 
"ID180. Would you like to buy one?" 
  "Maybe when the eggs hatch, God willing!" 
<H5>  Al-Mawsil Merchants and Price-Fixing </H5>
  Another fact emphasized by more than one wholesaler is that 
Mosul is a center of foreign trade and a depository of goods 
imported from Turkey and Jordan and prices are set by Mosul 
merchants. Naturally, we must put up with the high prices in 
hard currencies that Jordanian and Turkish merchants charge for 
their goods, especially food. The lack of alternatives forces 
the Iraqi merchant to pay up, and in hard currency! 
  For example, I was told by a store owner that he travels to 
Mosul daily in order to buy starch and other materials. Fifty 
kilos of starch goes for ID4,300. That means that he pays ID86 
per kilo, but starch is sold here at ID107 for a single kilo, 
spoilage and shipping costs notwithstanding! But retailers 
charge ID250 dinars per kilo. What is the big secret? 
  Haj Khalaf Jabbar, a retailer, responds: "Not all retailers 
realize exorbitant profits at the expense of the citizenry. It 
is that patriotic feeling for the motherland's stifling economic 
crisis. It is true that some people seek to exploit these 
conditions for illicit gain, but they will inevitably fall in 
their own trap and be outcast by society. I realize only a small 
profit on what I buy from wholesalers. I have been a merchant 
since 1980, and I used to own a sweet shop but blockade 
conditions forced me to close the shop and turn to selling food 
such as pickles and tomato paste." 
  "What is the price of tomato paste today?" 
  "We buy and sell it wholesale, ID930 for a case of Allen's 
brand [as published], owned by Abu Jamal, and ID935 for the 
product of Bayt Binyah. I also sell lentils supplied by 
al-Haddad, a well-known wholesaler with a capital of ID10 
million. A 25-kilogram sack of lentils is priced at ID1,850. I 
sometimes travel to al-Mawsil to bring pickles, which I sell for 
ID87." 
<H5>  Wishful Thinking: Lentils for 100 Fils!! </H5>
  'Ali al-Haj Hadi al-Haddad owns wholesale and retail stores. 
I met him at his large warehouse, which was crammed with sacks 
of lentils, peas, chickpeas, Baqla', etc. We learned that he has 
links with overseas wholesalers and that he seeks a small profit 
in view of the motherland's difficulties. He said: "I wish that 
prices would return to their natural original levels and that 
lentils, for example, would sell for 100 fils a kilo as they did 
in the eighties. I am aware of the hardships that salaried 
employees and retirees face in providing their families with 
food and clothing when prices are so exorbitant, and I try to 
moderate prices to the extent I can. The reason for high prices 
is that Jordanian and Turkish traders charge in dollars. Tomato 
paste, for instance, is $17.500 [as published] at a time when 
the domestic exchange rate of the dollar is high because of its 
scarcity and because its holders dictate their own price. Today, 
thanks to intervention by the state and by our astute 
leadership, we hope for a considerable change in dollar exchange 
rates that may help bring prices down. A sack of lentils that 
sold last month for ID1,500 now commands ID1,725 because demand 
is high in the month of Ramadan. We sell it for ID1,725. I 
expect a reduction in lentils' prices next month. We always sell 
at ID10 to ID15 below market." 
  We asked: "But agents, meaning retailers, sell at high 
prices 
in the marketplace and the profit primarily goes to them. Do you 
maintain agents or outlets to sell directly to consumers and 
give them the benefit of such reductions in food prices?" 
  "No, although I do sell to all--merchants as well as 
citizens. A retailer is supposed to be governed by his 
professional conscience and should not realize exorbitant 
profits at citizens' expense. I do sell to citizens also, and in 
kilos (i.e., at retail) in order that they may benefit from my 
reduced prices." 
  "What do you think is the cause of these daily price 
escalations and fluctuations?" 
  "Some retailers raise their prices daily depending on dollar 
exchange rates that day, even though the affected merchandize 
has not moved. They do this in order to gain at the expense of 
citizens. It makes no sense for prices to change daily, and that 
is why some merchants hoard certain goods and seek to withdraw 
them from the marketplace when they see that their prices are 
stable on foreign markets. They do this in order to realize 
outrageous profits, which is greed personified. A true merchant 
is governed primarily by his morals in order to gain a good 
reputation among people. He must sell existing inventory based 
on the prices he paid without padding those prices, even if they 
do go up. Quantities of essential foodstuffs sold to consumers 
should be limited in order to ward off hoarding for personal 
gain, and the same goes even for essential animal needs, in 
order to make them readily available at reasonable prices. 
<H5>  A Suggestion To Help Lower Prices </H5>
  Merchant Khalil Hasan al-Sa'ydi owns a distribution bureau. 
He is the only distributor of dry yeast in Iraq and he 
distributes other foodstuffs as well. We asked him about the law 
of supply and demand--the economic theory that seems to work 
backwards in Iraq. The supply of any one good far exceeds 
demand, especially since the purchasing power of citizens keeps 
on diminishing. He answered me, emphasizing that the dollar, not 
supply and demand, rules the market and controls prices. That is 
the reason for escalating prices, despite weak demand. "We hope 
that prices come down next month, now that the state has taken 
control of sales of dollars and will subject it to certain 
controls. I suggest that the Ministry of Trade should supervise 
the distribution of goods imported by merchants to ward off 
seepage into black markets. I propose that the manifests of 
imported goods be submitted to the Ministry of Trade for 
approval, then be presented to a bank that would dispense the 
purchase amount in dollars. That would likely lower food prices 
considerably, prevent the importation of nonessential luxury 
goods, and conserve foreign exchange. The way it is dispensed 
would serve the interests of citizens and their essential needs. 
Oversight would ensure the goods reach consumers rather than 
seep to other outlets." 
  We add our, "We wish!"

<F P=106> [Article by Sa'd Matashar: "Doctors' Fees"] </F>
  [Text] "Uncle Kazim," 60, is a retired villager. They 
prescribed a specialist in Baghdad for him and told him that 
this doctor would find him a cure and would end his struggle 
with the disease. The man borrowed a sum of money, left part of 
it with his family, and came to the capital with 300 Iraqi 
dinars [ID] in his pocket. According to his account, his family 
would have been delighted when he returned in sound health. The 
man went to Baghdad, from street to street and bus to bus, until 
he found his way to the doctor's clinic, but he was shocked to 
find that admission to the doctor was "commercial." He asked for 
an explanation, and they told him: If you are in a hurry, you 
have to pay more to enter before others. If you have no money, 
register and wait. The man heard this advice and said to 
himself: I'll wait; it is better and less costly. He was 
directed to the secretary so that he could register, but a major 
disaster occurred because the examination fee was ID100. 
<H5>  Medical Specialists and Practitioners Abuse Price Schedule </H5>
for Medical Services 
  The story of Uncle Kazim is an appropriate entry into the 
world of medicine and into a discussion of the fees of doctors 
and their private clinics. Come with us to the world of the 
angels of mercy. 
  Medicine is not a business. The complaints we hear about 
high 
fees and the high cost of drugs, tests, and medical analyses 
should not be extended or generalized to the rest of private 
clinics, which are still maintaining their humaneness. The story 
of exploiting medicine and selling it on sidewalks and in 
bandage shops must be ended. 
  Every citizen has the right to treatment and medicine, and 
he 
must be able to obtain them without being exploited. How can 
that be achieved? Some of these clinics have very unfortunately 
been turned into profit-seeking commercial centers and are 
trading on people's illnesses, especially those people who 
cannot pay the price to restore their health. 
  For many years, the state has enjoyed excellent health 
planning, which begins at the point of citizen health awareness 
and never ends, because medicine is an ever-changing science, 
advancing minute by minute. From the start, the state has 
enacted laws eliminating exploitation and monopolization, 
liberating the citizen from the "deceit" that was being 
practiced by some, and moving toward "openness," so that the 
citizen may be free of ailments. Our society has rid itself of 
all that, thanks to the Iraqi citizen's cultural growth and the 
expansion of his scientific understanding. 
  Because we do not wish to return to that dark age in the 
life 
of our people, we must put a stop to the high fees of doctors' 
private clinics. The doctor in his clinic should be more relaxed 
and ready to talk and listen to the patient, in contrast to the 
situation in the hospital. Certainly, the doctor should think 
about his private clinic's reputation and seek clients for it. 
If he only had the same feelings about his work in the hospital, 
perhaps the picture would change. Some doctors comment on this 
situation, saying that analyzing the situation in this way does 
doctors a disservice, since the patient is the same, as is the 
disease and the medicine. However, many are referred to the 
hospital, and the severe overcrowding causes the doctor not to 
give the same care to the referred patient. Perhaps he cannot 
diagnose the patient's condition. We have heard that certain 
doctors in hospitals suffer from that a great deal, with the 
number of patients referred reaching up to 1,000 a day, and 
sometimes even more! 
  This excuse might be acceptable, but why the excessively 
high 
fees for the examination? Is it reasonable for fees to be ID100 
in certain private clinics? In certain dental clinics, the cost 
goes up to ID1,000 when the visit is repeated. The fee to pull a 
tooth is ID100. Those who cannot pay suffer from toothaches. 
Should one have to suffer from a toothache? May God protect us 
and you from the evil of pain. Who is responsible for monitoring 
doctors' clinics, their fees, and their violations? There are 
many medical clinics that have a sign bearing the medical 
specialist's name, but the general practitioner who works there 
demands a specialist's fees. We think that sometimes there are 
two signs for one doctor: the first with the name of a general 
practitioner and the second with the name of a specialist! 
  We have become convinced that lack of supervision has made 
matters lax. Violations have become complaints that everybody 
talks about, despite the fact that doctors' official fees are 
set by law and are ID10 for a specialist and ID5 for a general 
practitioner. Therefore, receiving a payment that is more than 
that is a clear and distinct violation of the law. 
  The practical certainty is that diagnosis is half the 
treatment and perhaps requires the patient to visit 
laboratories, undergo analysis and examinations, and have X 
rays. The cost of these services has become excessively high. 
Doing the simplest analysis is not less than ID50; X rays exceed 
ID100, and the simplest visit to these laboratories costs ID500 
and, sometimes, as high as ID1,000. 
  As for the reason for these high prices, we have heard from 
many doctors that some of it is because of the blockade, the 
high prices that the medical market demands, and the current 
shortage of solutions used in analytical processes, which are 
imported materials that the iniquitous blockade keeps out of the 
country and the prices of which have become unreal. This cost is 
inevitably obtained from the patient, but the consideration is 
not always money, since there is a greater issue, man's health. 
From what we have also heard, there are erroneous diagnoses as a 
result of using commercial medical analytic solutions that are 
not of the same caliber of medical solutions that used to be 
imported by the state. 
  Some doctors have converted their private clinics into 
hospitals in which the patient finds various therapeutic 
services. We do not call these services harmful, but they might 
be unnecessary or of no value to the referred patient. However, 
the doctor suggests having them, and each one costs something. 
In the clinic of one doctor who specializes in fractures and 
bone surgery, we have seen a room for natural treatment, another 
for orthopedics, a third room for examinations, and a hall for 
physical therapy. In order that the patient may reach a certain 
degree of recovery, he must periodically be referred to have 
physical therapy and pass through all of these rooms, all the 
while paying the fees. 
  Patient 'Ala' Hamid underwent an ankle operation in Dr. 
H.K.'s clinic. The operation cost him ID5,000, which was just 
the doctor's fee; ID1,000 in fees for the hospital room; and 
nearly ID500 for medicine. Since the operation two months ago, 
he has paid nearly ID2,000 and is still being referred to his 
private doctor because he has not completely healed. He pays for 
each referral. I asked him: What do you do? 
  [Hamid] I'm a government employee. 
  [Matashar] Where did you get the money? 
  [Hamid] This money was for emergencies, and I spent it in 
the 
hospital. 
  [Matashar] Why didn't you have the operation in a government 
hospital? 
  [Hamid] They advised me in the national hospital, and I took 
their word. 
  [Matashar] Why? 
  [Hamid] One day after the operation, they put me out. I paid 
my money and my referrals to the doctor's clinic began. I even 
sold my wife's gold, and the journey continues. 
  Another patient told us about the quest for treatment for 
his 
illness (heart). He said: "God is the healer. Health is great 
happiness. One does not know its value, until it is lost, God 
forbid. 
  [Matashar] How about doctors' fees? 
  [Patient] Doctors are human beings...they are good persons. 
They help the sick and are generous with them. I have been 
referred to many clinics, and I have seen those who pay their 
examination fees out of their daily food money. There are 
doctors who set aside one day a week to see the poor. I was one 
who was referred on this day. This doctor hung a sign that said 
that the examination and treatment were free for those who could 
not pay. 
  On the other hand, there are private clinics with exorbitant 
prices. They have reached the point of not being able to 
differentiate between black and white. Money becomes the primary 
concern. It is strange that we have begun to hear about the 
urgent reservation and the ordinary reservation. This is 
inhumane. It is not right to expose our society to this, because 
treatment and medicine should be for all, not just for the 
wealthy but not the poor. We also question whether the blockade 
has affected food supplies and medicine. Is it true that it 
affects humanitarian dealings? The answer, of course, is well 
known. 
  The private dental clinics attract unhappy talk. Fees in 
these clinics have reached abnormal heights. The extraction of a 
tooth, ID100; simple gum therapy, ID75; examination, ID50; 
ordinary filling, ID100; root filling, ID300; operation to 
extract a wisdom tooth, ID500; manufacture and fitting of a 
movable tooth, ID300; fixed tooth, ID400; manufacture of a full 
set of teeth, ID1,000. 
  In Dr. J.K.'s clinic, which specializes in internal and 
heart 
diseases, we broached the matter with one of those referred. She 
was a doctor who came with one of her ailing relatives because 
she was acquainted with the doctor's skill and his knowledge. He 
is a professor at the Medical College and a fellow of the 
largest medical college in the world. This doctor--the 
referral--thinks the problem of rising medical fees has become 
apparent in the last few years. It is a case that is linked to 
the general situation and should not be overblown or 
media-hyped. The problem will end when matters are stabilized. 
We asked her: Why did it appear recently? 
  She said: "Because medicine is a skill. The doctor has a 
right to take an appropriate fee in exchange for his skill or 
service that he gives to the citizen. The doctor is also a human 
being who deserves a certain standard of living, along with a 
car and the ownership of a home, so that he feels that his work 
has not been in vain." 
  Good, but those who cannot pay? 
  "I don't believe that there are those who cannot pay. Even 
if 
such a person is found, he has government hospitals; their doors 
are open to all." 
  But the patient seeks the best service. 
  "Yes, everything has a price." 
  We spoke with another referral, named Sami 'Abdallah. We 
asked him, what's the problem? 
  He said: "When you are referred, the doctor in the 
government 
hospital deals with you in a sullen manner. You are then forced 
to visit him in his private clinic, and, when you buy his full 
services, you are welcomed with a smiling face." 
  Another patient said: "Doctors are not the only problem." 
  What is the problem? 
  "Medicine and searching for someone who sells it. Making the 
rounds of pharmacies and bandage shops. The black market." 
  As opposed to our findings on this tour, there was a 
contrary 
view. Dr. A.S. talked to us about the concerns of doctors, which 
start with establishing the clinic. In Baghdad, this costs 
ID150,000 in areas far from the city center, while on the main 
streets it reaches ID500,000 and perhaps ID1 million. There is 
also the cost of medical equipment. Some systems cost ID100,000 
or ID150,000, but they are necessary in private clinics. In 
addition, there are the high costs of services, such as rent, 
secretarial, etc. There are other reasons for the wave of 
universally high costs, which are linked to the iniquitous 
blockade imposed upon our country. With regard to the doctor's 
humaneness, our interlocutor said: 
  "It is unreasonable to think that a doctor would not be 
humane. First, and above all, he has compassion. Therefore, he 
does not begrudge helping those who need it. I don't believe 
that any doctor would refuse to offer his services to the ill." 
  It only remains to say that the Physicians Union, to which 
we 
offered a summary of this report, apparently intends not to 
intervene in this problem. It preferred to remain silent, 
despite our insistence in obtaining its opinion. However, the 
Cabinet has formed a special committee to study doctors' fees, 
preparatory to drafting a special price list. This committee is 
composed of representatives from the Ministry of Health, the 
Physicians Union, and other agencies.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with members of National Front for the </F>
Salvation of Libya, by 'Ali al-Ruz in Stockholm; date not given: 
"We Formed Three Organizations; the Regime Discovered the Plan"] 
  [Text] Three Libyan officers have been able to flee Libya 
after taking part in the events known as the "October uprising." 
They may be the only members of the secret military organization 
to escape imprisonment. They were able to reach a "safe haven" 
after five months of transiting through Arab and foreign 
countries. They are now members of the (opposition) National 
Front for the Salvation of Libya, which they said has had a plan 
of internal action to bring down the regime and "establish a 
constitutional democratic alternative" since 1992. 
  The officers, whom AL-HAYAH interviewed in a Scandanavian 
country, were preparing their departure for another destination, 
as other opposition members--also Front members--were doing; for 
them, exile consists of constantly changing locales. 
  What are the facts about the "uprising," the arrests, the 
secret military organization, and their connection to the 
Salvation Front? Why do most of the detainees belong to the 
Warfallah tribe? How was the organization's plan discovered? How 
did the officers manage to flee Libya? The officers answered 
these and other questions as follows: 
  Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Bashir Salih, 36, was 
born in Bani Walid. He joined the army in 1978, and was trained 
in Yugoslavia and Russia. He says that since 1988 he had 
considered playing a role for change and joined the secret 
military organization led by Major 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir in 
1991 after the latter told him about it. 
  Salih says that "the Libyan situation is what dictated this 
course of action to me. We have no state, no institutions, no 
laws, nor a constitution. Our wealth is being wasted by the 
leaders of this regime, and the army, which supposedly is based 
on discipline, following orders, abilities, and a clear 
objective, is the state's protection. At first, its role was 
reduced to protecting the regime; then it shrank even further, 
to suit the interests of guard regiments such as the Deterrent 
Force and the 9th Brigade, because the regime does not trust its 
own people. So the units of these regiments are controlled by 
officers of the al-Qadhadhifah tribe. 
<H5>  Warfallah </H5>
  Speaking of the role of the Warfallah tribe in the military 
mutiny, especially as it is known to support the Libyan regime, 
Maj. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir, 38, of Bani Walid, has this to say: 
"Contrary to popular belief, the Warfallah tribe was not with 
our tribe (170,000 persons), which is large and scattered 
throughout all the regions of Libya. Traditionally, it has 
protected the al-Qadhadhifah from raids. It gave them their land 
in Surt. If you mean the members of the Revolutionary 
Committees, why, every tribe has its upstarts or opportunists, 
so this is not surprising." 
  He explained that "even if most of those taking part in 
military action were Warfallah, that does not mean that other 
tribes did not take part. A quick look at the names of the 
detainees shows that they come from every tribe and region. Plus 
the fact that the objective of the action was not narrow or 
strictly `Warfalli' in its principles. The proof is that as 
military officers we all agreed to hand power over to a 
civilian, in the event our movement succeeded. That civilian 
would have been Dr. Muhammad al-Muqaryif, and he is not from the 
Warfallah." 
  Captain Salim Dabnun Muhammad al-Wa'ir, 31, is from Bani 
Walid, and says that the Warfallah "is a tribe scattered through 
Tripoli, Misratah, Banghazi, Surt, Sabha, and the south. No 
Libyan regime can stand against it. The present regime has 
sought aid from a group of opportunists and chosen them to be 
what is called an authority, a resource for finding a tribal 
deterrent for it. It has succeeded in this to a great extent, 
even though the tribe has been hurt more than anyone." Lt. Col. 
Salih says that "the city of Bani Walid has stayed the way it is 
since the Turks left it. It has no water system, no good roads, 
nor an infrastructure." 
<H5>  The Secret Organization </H5>
  How was the secret military organization established? Capt. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir says that he was first responsible for 
the idea of an organization, "and following my graduation in 
1980 the army was assigning tasks whose objectives were unknown. 
We fought in Chad and Uganda. I lived in Lebanon from 1987 with 
the volunteers' set-up for the victory of what were called 
national and Islamic forces, and helping Palestinian 
organizations. In December 1988, I returned to Libya and 
proposed the idea of this organization to a group of officers. 
There were five of us. Then I went back to Lebanon in 1990 and 
met Col. Mustafa Bil-Qasim in an Arab country, and told him 
about the organization. We agreed that he would work in one 
fashion, and I would work in another, in total secrecy. I went 
back to Libya at the end of 1991 and completed the structure of 
the organization, which now had 10 men. I believe that the 
number of members in Mustafa's organization was comparable to 
our number." 
  Lt. Col. Salih explains, "'Abd-al-Salam studied matters 
carefully before choosing members. He nominated me in 1990 for 
organization membership; my comrades were put under 
surveillance, then 1991 brought my intention and my proper role. 
I agreed immediately and enthusiastically, because I had 
patriotic feelings, but order was lacking in the organization. I 
was not afraid at all, because someone who is afraid cannot 
think of action anyway, and will look for the easy way out." 
  Capt. Salim al-Wa'ir says, "I graduated from public high 
school in 1983 and was surprised to find that my official course 
was to join the army, because in Libya they choose your future 
career. I left in 1985 and was assigned to Bani Walid in a 
marine battalion, then I was transferred to the Republican Guard 
brigade, which has been assigned to guarding the regime since 
1986, and I remained part of it until I left Libya. In 1988, I 
learned of the organization's order from 'Abd-al-Salam, and I 
gave my consent immediately, especially since a passion for 
change burned in my heart--against corruption, bribery, 
domination, control, the absence of institutions, and the 
perversion of the very concept of government." 
  The three officers agree that they would hold no extended 
meetings, only brief encounters in a car or one of their houses; 
there were never more than three persons present at any one 
meeting. Any talk of politics was forbidden. They had excellent 
relations with those known for their loyalty to the regime, in 
order to dispel any suspicion. Salih says, "'Abd-al-Salam told 
us to coordinate with other organizations--some of us had no 
knowledge that these organizations even existed." 
<H5>  The "Salvation Front" </H5>
  'Abd-al-Salam says that in 1992 he told Col. Bil-Qasim of 
the 
need to open a channel of communication with the National Front 
for the Salvation of Libya abroad, "because it was the one 
effective faction, and news of it reached us through smuggled 
newspapers or broadcasts, and because its members were known in 
Libya for their honesty and ability, and I agreed to this. 
  "I began to get indirect contacts, from which we understood 
that the Front had linked up with domestic military action." 
  He continues: "In 1993, a third organization, headed up by 
Col. Miftah Qarrum Fakkallah (who suffers from leukemia), joined 
the first two, and one of the members of this organization, Maj. 
Khalil al-Jidak, surprised Col. Bil-Qasim by broaching this 
subject with him, of joining the organization, then the picture 
cleared up and we became three organizations with nearly equal 
memberships, with a broad network of relations with ranking 
officers, civilians, and technocrats. We agreed to intensify our 
contacts with the Front, to speed up our action. Al-Jidak opened 
up a major liaison channel, and another channel through our 
brother Sa'd Misbah, who was living in Spain. There were 
meetings in Europe in which al-Jidak and Qarrum took part with 
the Front leadership." 
  Salim al-Wa'ir says, "The option of an agreement with the 
Front gave us added comfort and strength. We saw in their 
partnership the only solution for the success of our movement, 
because of their capabilities and their international 
connections. They were also the strongest faction pursuing the 
objective of toppling the regime by any means. They rejected 
dialogue with the regime despite all inducements." Salih 
believes that "the regime's attacks on the Front and its leaders 
made us even more intent on cooperating with them. The 
slanderous attacks on Dr. al-Muqaryif made us even more eager to 
cooperate with him, despite the constant defamation to which he 
was subjected. We have a folk saying in Libya that goes, `You 
cannot hide sunshine with a sieve.'" 
<H5>  The Goal of the Operation </H5>
  'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir continues: "After numerous contacts 
and meetings, a plan of action was agreed upon, to be 
implemented by spring 1994 at the latest. I agreed with 
Bil-Qasim and Qarrum on the broad lines of the plan to topple 
the regime and the transitional period. There was one goal: to 
overturn the ruling regime and proclaim the establishment of a 
constitutional, democratic state, to keep the transitional 
period short, between two and three years, and that the head of 
state be a civilian during that period. We all agreed to select 
Dr. Muhammad Yusuf al-Muqaryif for that job. We also agreed to 
delegate responsibilities among ourselves during the 
transitional period, in light of the practical contributions of 
the groups and persons. Our intention was also linked to the 
need to seek the assistance of all patriotic and specialized 
technical elements, especially those not deeply involved in the 
practices of the current ruling regime." 
  Salih indicates that the choice of a civilian to head the 
government "served the interests of Libya best of all, because 
we saw the transitional period as the most delicate in the 
process of eliminating the regime. It would bring the country 
back to a new starting point. If we did not proceed on 
systematic, civilized bases, we might have borne the 
responsibility for losing Libya another year." 
<H5>  The "Elimination" Operation </H5>
  Capt. Salim reveals that the members of the organization 
planned out a "communique number one" and a plan of action for 
zero hour, without specifying a clear time, pending the 
completion of contacts and preparations. He says that the plan 
required "rapid, lightning-fast action in Tripoli, and from 
there to neighboring large cities, particularly as those 
belonging to the organizations ordered basic battalions who had 
ammunition and advanced weapons. Under their command were 
individuals of proven courage and experience. The units would 
move in Tripoli, Banghazi, Misratah (120 km from Tripoli), 
Tarhunah (80 km), Sabratah (60 km), and Gharyan (80 km). The 
targets were the command headquarters at Bab al-'Aziziyah, the 
intelligence department, the Jamahiriyah Security Commission, 
and centers of guard brigade concentrations. But the regime 
discovered the operation, and we considered speeding it up, to 
implement it on 15 October. However, the arrests and 
confrontations began on 12 October, which led to the outcome, 
which is known." 
<H5>  The Regime's Indications </H5>
  How did the officers know that the regime had discovered the 
operation? In 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir's words, "there were 
several actions on the part of the regime that indicated they 
knew something about the military organization. Such as: 
stepped-up surveillance of military men, the assignment of new 
men into the units, and the consolidation of security units the 
regime most depended upon (the Deterrent, the Guards, and the 
9th Brigade) headed up by Lt. Col. Mas'ud 'Abd-al-Hafiz, 
commander of the staff of the guard; he was appointed chief of 
staff. The crossing points on our borders with Egypt and Tunisia 
were reviewed. Security passes for the military were revoked, a 
brigade of the guards was transferred to Bani Walid, the 
intelligence chief Maj. al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi made a tour of 
the eastern regions, and Colonel al-Qadhdhafi met with relatives 
of his among former officers in Sabha. They were resident in 
Misratah, and he formed them into committees, because, as 
al-Qadhdhafi told them--the first cell of the revolution--in his 
speech in September 1993, "no one can play with the lion in his 
mouth." Then there was the meeting of the intelligence director 
in Tripoli, Jum'ah Bin-Niran, with security officers, in which 
he told them that al-Qadhdhafi's words indicated there was a 
conspiracy inside the army, and the movement of military units 
to agricultural projects." 
  Capt. Salim says, "We felt uneasy, and we understood that a 
counter-plot was being prepared to thwart ours. We contacted the 
second organization, and its leader confirmed that his group had 
not been penetrated, nor had the third." 
  'Abd-al-Salam explains his belief that the penetration may 
have occurred in the organization "which had recently joined us 
because the arrests had concentrated on its members, in one 
swoop." Perhaps "the regime got some information about the 
action from a foreign source I didn't know about, or maybe there 
was some mistake that led to some information leak. Anyway, we 
did not retreat--we thought about moving up the appointed day, 
to 15 October." 
<H5>  The Arrests </H5>
  Lt. Col. Salih says, "On 12 October, military intelligence 
arrested Col. Miftah Qarrum, Col. Mustafa Bil-Qasim, Maj. 'Ali 
al-Kakali, Maj. Khalil al-Jidak, Maj. Ramadan al-'Iyhawri, and 
others. A lieutenant colonel was arrested in al-Kufrah and 
another in Gharyan, a major in Zuwarah along with nearly 20 
civilians. There were some confrontations with officers during 
the arrests, and some other units moved in some barracks, 
commanded by officers from the organization when they heard of 
the regime's movements toward them, and when they learned of the 
arrests. Other units blew up an ammunitions dump in Bani Walid, 
which is where the most violent clashes took place. 
International wire services described these as "the Bani Walid 
incidents" or "the Bani Walid mutiny." 
<H5>  How They Fled </H5>
  How did they escape from Libya? Salih says, "I cannot tell 
the whole story, because it would endanger many people. I stayed 
in Tripoli for two days, then left via a neighboring country, by 
land, and from there to another Arab country. There I learned 
that Libyan intelligence had asked its officers to turn me over, 
but they refused. Then I met with 'Abd-al-Salam and Salim on a 
Mediterranean trip, and we headed for Europe together." He 
explained that the authorities arrested his brother, a father of 
five, the last of whom, named 'Abd-al-Fattah, had been born only 
one month previous. 
  'Abd-al-Salam and Salim escaped together. They say, "On the 
morning of 12 October, we got a telephone call from someone we 
knew, speaking cautiously, in code, which led us to phone an 
officer in the organization to warn him, or find out his fate. 
We went quickly to the homes of some of the organization 
members, and found intelligence vehicles in front of the homes. 
Then we went to a person we wanted to ask about, and we found 
his neighbors and members of his family in a state of anxiety 
and confusion, and we realized then that the operation was over." 
  They add: "Fortunately, our organization had not been 
penetrated, for the arrests continued for nearly two months. We 
thought of leaving Libya, though, on the same day of the 
arrests. We left with only the clothes on our backs, personal 
sidearms, and our passports, and crossed the border of a 
neighboring country with no problem. Our names had not yet been 
flashed to the control posts. From that country we moved on to 
an African country, then an Arab country, then a Mediterranean 
country. There we met Lt. Col. Salih, and all left for a 
European country." 
  The three officers say that "God is supreme. This was our 
fate. We did all we could so that truth may prevail. Now, today, 
we are members of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, 
in which we found our brothers-in-arms and in honorable 
citizenship, and they are all among the finest of Libya's 
citizens." 
<H5>  Officers' Trials </H5>
  'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir has this to say about the recent 
trials of the organization's officers, which were shown on 
Libyan television, in which the officers said that they were 
spying for America: "This is a scenario we knew about even 
before it was shown on television. No one in Libya is fooled by 
it. Those are honorable officers, and their history is well 
known. If we were agents, we were agents for Libya." He adds: 
"And the trials--anyone who followed them saw the clear 
contradiction in the prosecutors' claims and questions. One 
minute they accused us of wanting to spy against Arab unity; 
this is an innovation that occurs only in Libya and on Libyan 
television. The next minute they said we were spying on the 
man-made river, on behalf of America and the technical 
consulting office for the river, which is in America--but its 
technicians know every inch of the man-made river. Then they say 
we're spying on the al-Rabitah factory, but the regime itself 
announced nearly two years ago that a fire destroyed the tool 
factory in al-Rabitah; that the factory doesn't exist. Then they 
say we're spying on the missile program being developed. But the 
regime itself said two years ago that it had no such missiles. 
Libyans know very well that interrogations begin with spying 
against Arab unity and end with spying on a tool factory. It was 
a phony interrogation, in which the officers confessed as the 
result of torture. Plus the fact that someone whose mission was 
espionage would not go around recruiting these huge numbers of 
officers and civilians."

<F P=106> [Article by Sulayman Namir: "New Saudi Aid for Palestinians </F>
in Occupied Territories"] 
  [Text] The Saudi minister of finance and national economy, 
Muhammad Aba-al-Khayl, has announced that King Fahd of Saudi 
Arabia has issued directives to allocate $20 million as aid to 
Palestinians living in the occupied territories for them to 
establish development, educational, and health-related projects 
as well as social welfare projects and public facilities via the 
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees 
(UNRWA). 
  Mr. Aba-al-Khayl said that the $20 million is part of a 
total 
of $100 million which King Fahd has decided to provide as aid 
for the Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
  It should be mentioned that Saudi Arabia had pledged to 
provide the $100 million, as aid to the Palestinians in the 
occupied territories for them to establish their government and 
authority, after the signing of the Oslo agreement dealing with 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The Saudi minister, in a statement broadcast by the Saudi 
News Agency, also said: "An UNRWA delegation will arrive in 
Riyadh in order to conclude an agreement concerning arrangements 
for carrying out the agreement between the Saudi Development 
Fund and UNRWA dealing with cooperation in this area." 
  Diplomatic observers see in this decision by King Fahd an 
indication that Saudi Arabia has not waited for the 
establishment of the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho in order to 
begin furnishing the aid it had publicly committed itself to 
providing after the signing of the Oslo agreement. On the 
contrary, Saudi Arabia decided to begin right away with its aid 
to Palestinians in the occupied territories who are suffering 
from bad economic, educational, and social conditions. This is 
being done by means of UNRWA, which oversees projects dealing 
with improvement of the Palestinians' conditions in the 
territories, so that the furnishing of the aid is not influenced 
by political developments involving the Palestinian cause or by 
the course of the negotiations with Israel. 
  Saudi Arabia apparently feels that the negotiations still 
require time--time that the Palestinians perhaps cannot afford 
to take because of their economic and social conditions in the 
occupied territories. 
  In this regard, it is noted that there are three types of 
material aid that Saudi Arabia is providing to the Palestinians 
at this stage, and they are the following: 
  1. Official aid that will start going to the Palestinians 
via 
UN humanitarian organizations, and this is the aid that was 
announced yesterday. 
  2. Aid for the masses of people, which will go to the 
Palestinians via the PLO. This aid is being collected by popular 
committees to help the Palestinian people, and they are headed 
by Prince Salman Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, governor of the district of 
Riyadh. Most of the aid is collected by means of 5-percent 
deductions from the salaries of Palestinians working in Saudi 
Arabia. This aid has never been cut off since it began being 
collected in 1968--not even during the periods of tension in 
relations between Saudi Arabia and the leadership of the PLO, 
and not even during the crisis period when Iraq occupied Kuwait. 
  3. Aid for the masses of people, which is collected by means 
of campaigns organized to support a particular project, such as 
the campaign unleashed by Prince Salman Bin-'Abd- al-'Aziz, on 
instructions from King Fahd given during the latter part of last 
Ramadan, to save Jerusalem. This aid, according to Prince 
Salman, will go directly to the Palestinians of Jerusalem. 
  In addition to these types of aid, there are other forms of 
Saudi aid provided directly to the occupied territories. There 
is, for example, the aid to specific projects such as the 
project to restore the al-Aqsa Mosque and other Islamic holy 
places in Jerusalem, which King Fahd donated money to finance 
last year. There is also the aid consisting of donations to some 
of the educational, social, and health-related establishments in 
the occupied territories, such as the unpublicized donations 
provided by King Fahd to the hospital run by the Association for 
Islamic Charitable Purposes in Jerusalem and King Fahd's recent 
donation to the victims of the massacre in Hebron. 
  In addition to the above, there are donations provided by 
Saudi businessmen directly to educational and health-related 
projects in the occupied territories, such as the donation by 
the Saudi businessman 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Juraysi, head of the 
Saudi Council of Chambers of Commerce, for the purpose of 
constructing and furnishing Bi'r Zayt University's College of 
Administration and Business building. Before this, there was the 
donation by the businessman 'Umar al-'Aqqad for the purpose of 
constructing and furnishing the College of Engineering in this 
same university. Also, the businessman Sabih al-Misri donated 
$3.5 million for the construction and furnishing of a new 
building for the medical clinics in the hospital run by the 
Association for Islamic Charitable Purposes, and many Saudi 
companies and establishments have donated sums of money annually 
to this hospital.

<F P=106> [Article by Catherine Simon: "Murder of Two French Religious </F>
in Algiers Shocks Catholic Community"; first paragraphi is LE 
MONDE introduction] 
  [Text] At the same time that a march for "dialogue" 
was taking place in Algiers under the sponsorship of about 10 
political movements, some of which represent moderate Islamists, 
two French religious were being murdered in the Casbah on Sunday 
8 May. 
  Algiers--Sitting right on the sidewalk, a group of 
adolescents was quietly playing dominoes. From the nearby mosque 
could be heard the chant of the muezzin calling the faithful to 
evening prayers. The city was calm. Algiers was winding down as 
though nothing had happened. As though death were another story. 
  Helene Saint-Raymond, a nun belonging to the Little Sisters 
of the Assumption, and Henri Verges, a Marist priest, were very 
familiar with the city. Sister Helene, 67, arrived here in 1968, 
while Father Verges, 64, came in 1969. Both were perfect Arabic 
scholars, and they worked at the Ben Cheneb Library in the upper 
Casbah--one of the few places were lycee students from the 
neighborhood could gain access to books at the cost of a few 
dinars. It was there, in their office, "practically before the 
eyes of the young people," that they were shot to death in the 
early afternoon. Their assailants, "two young terrorists armed 
with automatic pistols," according to the French-language daily 
EL WATAN, managed to escape. 
  "We are stunned. I can't find words," sighed one of their 
priest friends, who himself has lived for many years in one of 
those "working class" suburbs--meaning "deprived" suburbs and 
therefore commonly regarded as bastions of armed Islamism. In 
all, it is estimated that there are more than 400 French 
Catholic religious scattered around the territory. "I pay 
attention, yes, of course," the old priest added. But how can 
one defend oneself in this lethal lottery that has claimed over 
3,000 victims nationwide in the past two years? By restricting 
one's movements as much as possible, avoiding "high-risk" 
neighborhoods, and constantly changing one's residence and the 
routes one takes. But those rules can be followed only by a tiny 
minority of privileged individuals, whether Algerian or French. 
Obviously, French religious are not in that category. 
<H5>  March for `Dialogue' </H5>
  Like the some 20,000 registered individuals with dual 
nationality, the majority of whom are French women married to 
Algerians and in many cases residents themselves of the "working 
class" neighborhoods, Catholic religious are easy prey for the 
supporters of terrorism. 
  The shock here is tremendous. Because they are French and 
Christian, members of the French religious communities are the 
best possible targets from the standpoint of attracting media 
attention. The death of two of their number provides tragic 
confirmation of what many people were refusing to see: neither 
divine providence nor neighborliness protects foreigners. 
  The massacre of 12 Croatian nationals--of Christian 
origin--in the Tamezguida region east of Algiers last 14 
December profoundly shocked the Catholic community. But it did 
not convince them of the need to pack up and leave. Pending the 
return of Algiers Archbishop Tessier, who was in Rome at the 
time, no public statement was issued in Algiers. 
  The spokesman for the French Government, Nicolas Sarkozy, 
said that "Algeria is currently one of the most serious topics 
of concern for the prime minister." In Algiers, the Ministry of 
Interior firmly condemned the double murder and gave assurances 
that the perpetrators would be "found and punished." It added 
that Algeria, "famous for its hospitality and its respect for 
human life, is not and will never be [the Algeria] of murderers." 
  This new tragedy in the Casbah--where French cameraman 
Olivier Quemener was killed last 1 February--occurred barely two 
hours after the conclusion of the silent march in support of 
"dialogue" and "reconciliation" that had been organized by about 
10 political parties, including the FLN [National Liberation 
Front] (formerly the single party) and such "moderate" Islamist 
movements as Hamas, Ennahdha, and former President Ahmed Ben 
Bella's MDA [Algerian Movement for Democracy]. Is that proximity 
in time and space (the Casbah is right next to Martyrs Square, 
where the demonstration ended) a coincidence? According to the 
most probable theory, the murder of the two religious could be 
the work of "radical" Islamists hostile to all "dialogue" with 
the government and eager to remind people of their presence 
following the "clean-up" operations carried out by security 
forces in the main cities in the Algiers region. 
  But extremist "bearded ones" are not the only ones opposing 
the potential negotiations that the historic leaders of the 
former Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) have reportedly begun in 
secret with the military hierarchy now in power. 
  Some of the French-language newspapers have not hesitated to 
denounce the "march of shame" and harshly criticize the 
"conservatives" who, under the pretext of dialogue, are calling 
on the nation to "shake the hands of terrorists." Judging from 
what the newspapers say, the demonstration by the "reconcilers" 
attracted only 20,000 people in Algiers, compared to the 100,000 
who were expected. While the daily LE MATIN mocks what it 
regards as a "fiasco," its rival newspaper LIBERTE sums things 
up in a terse headline: "The People Did Not March."

<F P=106> [Commentary by H.T.: "Moral Dilemma"] </F>
  [Text] The murder of two religious is a new insult to a 
country that has sheltered the steeple, minaret, and synagogue 
in peace for so long. There is no reason to say that the Marist 
priest and the Assumptionist nun were killed primarily because 
they were members of religious orders or because they were 
French citizens. But the relentless logic of the 
Islamists--which is the same as that in Sudan or 
Egypt--invariably calls for attacking minorities, whether 
civilian or religious. This double murder constitutes a new test 
for relations between Christians and Muslims. And also for 
Islam, whose image is distorted by this new violation of the 
state of "dhimmitude" [Muslim toleration of religious 
minorities], which obligates the faithful to respect the weaker 
members of society--women and children--and priests as holy men. 
  There are still 30,000 Catholics in Algeria.[.sup]1[/] 
Faced with the rise of fundamentalism, the Christian communities 
of North Africa are having to deal with a moral dilemma, as 
evidenced by the synod of African bishops that has just been 
held in Rome (see page 14 [not reproduced]). They must 
simultaneously avoid exposing themselves and being made 
"martyrs" by the FIS on the one hand and, on the other, preserve 
the future and concrete friendships with moderate Muslims who 
are repelled by that Islamism. "It is necessary to stay because 
among us, it is a matter of loyalty," said Archbishop Tessier of 
Algiers before the murders on Sunday. And he added: "We have 
been with them during colonization and since independence. We 
remain with them in their anxieties." 
  The Christian churches have often been criticized for their 
naiveness in wanting to continue a dialogue with Islam at all 
costs, even when the latter was becoming more aggressive, even 
toward Christians and the Vatican. But rather than "naiveness," 
it is opposition that one must speak of today. There is an 
intransigent line of thinking that is inspired by events in 
Algeria, Egypt, and Sudan and hostile to the political 
statements of radical Islam. It is demanding as many rights for 
Christians in Islamic lands as Muslims enjoy in Christian lands, 
and its basis is the demand for "reciprocity" that was mentioned 
by the pope in Casablanca in 1985. But there is also resistance 
by a moderate group that advocates cooperation between 
Christians and Muslims in a multifaith and, at the moment, 
peaceful context, as is the case in Senegal, Mali, and even 
Libya. 
  If dialogue is still possible with all sincere Muslims who 
condemn terrorism and violence, and they are by far the most 
numerous and the most reduced to silence, good will in only one 
direction is not enough. It no longer seems capable of saving 
anyone, religious or not, in Algeria today. 
Footnote 
  1. Algeria has four Catholic dioceses (Algiers, Oran, 
Constantine, and Laghouati), 170 priests, 100 monks, and about 
350 nuns, most of whom are involved in educational and social 
work.

  [Excerpts] There is a fact that must not be forgotten, and 
it says that Kuwait prior to 2 August 1990 is different from 
today's and tomorrow's Kuwait. The lesson learned on that date 
was a lesson beyond imagination for all children of the Arab 
nation generally and for the children of Kuwait in particular. 
Nobody had imagined that the day would come when one Arab would 
attack another Arab brother, would invade his land, and would 
treat him as one treats enemy prisoners. 
  This is a history that has left its imprints on every heart, 
in the depths of every conscience, and in the crevices of the 
soul of every Kuwaiti who had been living safely and securely. 
This Kuwaiti citizen has responded to his Arab nation most 
sincerely, courageously, and faithfully and has tried as hard as 
possible to support his Arab brother in all positions and crises 
to the degree of his belief in this brother's position and his 
awareness of this brother's crisis. [passage omitted] 
  In this regard, we find that relations between Egypt and 
Kuwait are distinguished relations that crystallize that vital 
slogan that is applied seriously, enthusiastically, and with 
mutual faith. The slogan is that Egypt and Kuwait are brothers 
in time of tribulation and partners in time of prosperity. If 
time confirmed this fact in the past, whether before or after 
the aggression, then it behooves us to take a pause before the 
reflection of the Egyptian-Kuwaiti relations in the past year. 
  To start, we generally say that in 1993, Egyptian-Kuwaiti 
relations experienced constant growth at all levels. This growth 
reflected the strong boost these relations had gained during the 
aggression to which Kuwait was subjected by Saddam Husayn, 
Iraq's tyrant. This ordeal contributed to strengthening the 
bonds of love and fraternity between the two peoples, 
considering that Egyptians and Kuwaitis united as a single man 
in their rejection of the aggression and their defense of 
Kuwait's freedom and independence. 
  This growth in the two countries' relations was not confined 
to official aspects solely but was coupled with a noticeable 
leap in relations between the two fraternal peoples. This leap 
was embodied in the frequent visits between representatives of 
the two countries' popular organizations and in increased 
numbers of Kuwaiti tourists coming to Egypt, not to mention the 
single spirit that united both countries' read, seen, and heard 
media, which played the same tune for freedom, dignity, and 
independence. 
  When speaking of development of the Egyptian-Kuwaiti 
relations in 1993, we can say that a new spirit cast its shadows 
on the various aspects of cooperation between the two countries 
since the invasion ordeal that culminated with the invaders' 
defeat and with the restoration of Kuwait to its legitimate 
owners. This cooperation is no longer based on interest alone 
and it no longer relies on the conventional mainstays that bind 
all Arab and Islamic countries. Rather, other elements of 
rapprochement and harmony were generated and they resulted in 
the spontaneous solidarity between the two people's citizens 
during the ordeal. 
  It is worth noting that the direction of the bilateral 
Egyptian-Kuwaiti relations indicates greater closeness and 
communication in the coming phase, thus reinforcing the 
accomplishments made recently as a result of the wise leadership 
of His Highness Prince Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah, amir of the 
State of Kuwait, and His Excellency Muhammad Husni Mubarak, 
president of the Arab Republic of Egypt. 
<H5>  One Philosophy </H5>
  In the information and culture area, Kuwait was keen on 
organizing cultural weeks in Egypt, including art shows and 
varied intellectual and literary activities. They included the 
week organized by the University of Kuwait in cooperation with 
Alexandria University--a week which abounded with artistic and 
intellectual demonstrations that reflected the spirit of 
cooperation between the two countries. Kuwait also participated 
in the activities of the Cairo International Fair which was held 
at the beginning of this year. 
  Moreover, Cairo witnessed the visit by Kuwaiti Information 
Minister Shaykh Sa'ud Nasir al-Sabah who met with President 
Husni Mubarak and high-ranking officials. The minister concluded 
a number of agreements in the various information areas to 
bolster cooperation between the two countries' radio and 
television people. This cooperation was bolstered with the 
agreement concluded between Amin Basyuni, head of the Radio and 
Television Union; and Faysal al-Hajji, Kuwaiti Information 
Ministry undersecretary, to receive the transmission of the 
Kuwaiti satellite channel and to retransmit it in Egypt. Kuwait 
also purchased a large number of television and radio 
productions from the union. 
  Educational cooperation marched in step with the information 
cooperation. Egypt loaned 1,053 male and female teachers to 
Kuwait and increased the number of Kuwaiti male and female 
students in Egyptian institutes and universities to 816 
students. Egypt also contributes to the development of Kuwaiti 
curricula and meets Kuwait's needs for educational materials and 
requirements. 
  In a related development, the Kuwaiti Government and people 
contributed to the construction of dozens of schools to make up 
for the schools damaged by the October 1992 earthquake. Kuwait 
played a prominent role in alleviating the effects and in 
dealing with the consequences of that catastrophe. As of the 
moment news of the catastrophe were broadcast, Kuwait rushed to 
express its solidarity with Egypt. Kuwaiti Foreign Minister 
Shaykh Salim al-Sabah was the first Arab official to arrive in 
Cairo to convey condolences on the loss of the earthquake 
victims. Kuwait did not content itself with this moral gesture 
but proceeded to offer $20 million as a first installment to 
assist earthquake victims; established an air corridor to 
deliver medical and food supplies to Egypt; and launched active 
popular efforts to collect donations, which amounted to dozens 
of millions [of dollars]. 
<H5>  Egyptian Labor in Kuwait </H5>
  As Kuwait contributed with its great generosity to the 
reconstruction activities that followed the earthquake, Egypt 
continued to participate in the building and reconstruction 
operations that followed the liberation of Kuwait. Egyptian 
construction companies continued to perform their commendable 
role in restoring utilities and installations and contributed to 
the development projects going on in all parts of Kuwait. In 
addition to this direct participation, Egyptian labor and 
brains, working side-by-side with Kuwait's citizens, have 
contributed greatly to Kuwait's revival. After its liberation, 
Kuwait opened its doors to Egyptian labor and gave Egyptian 
workers all facilities and privileges that enable them to offer 
even more. Consequently, large numbers of Egyptians poured into 
Kuwait. By the beginning of 1993, their numbers amounted to 
140,000 Egyptians, representing 26 percent of the foreign labor, 
followed by Indian, Bengali, and Pakistani workers. A total of 
63 percent of the Egyptian workers in Kuwait are employed in the 
manufacturing sector and 17 percent in the trade and insurance 
sector. Out of the two countries' eagerness to safeguard 
Egyptian workers' rights, 1993 saw the conclusion of an 
agreement by the two countries' manpower ministers that 
stipulates that the salary of an Egyptian worker in Kuwait will 
be no less than 70 dinars [D] monthly, plus food and housing. 
Moreover, the two countries' labor unions have been working 
actively to bolster their cooperation in the various areas. 
<H5>  Open Lines </H5>
  In view of the importance of transportation and 
communication 
means in strengthening concerted cooperation between the two 
countries in the area of labor and other areas, officials have 
devoted attention to bolstering these means by increasing the 
number of telephone lines and eliminating obstacles in the area 
of air transport. Moreover, the Kuwaiti National Assembly 
approved the Egyptian-Kuwaiti agreement on land transportation 
of goods and passengers, which calls for abolishing any fees or 
other taxes levied on the two countries' citizens in these areas. 
  The positive steps taken by the two sides in this regard 
reflected positively on their economic relations. Trade activity 
and capital movement increased and Kuwaiti participation in 
varied production projects grew. An indication of this fact is 
that total loans and grants advanced by Kuwait to Egypt grew to 
$52 million to finance 16 projects. Egyptian officials assert 
that these sums have contributed effectively to Egypt's 
development programs because of their soft terms and high 
performance. In the context of bolstering the two countries' 
economic cooperation, the Kuwaiti Development Fund allocated 
$500 million as a contribution to Egypt's economic reform 
process until 1995. 
  A prominent project to which Kuwait contributed in 1993 is a 
project to reclaim 400,000 feddans of land in the Sinai at a 
total cost of 4 billion Egyptian pounds, to which Kuwait has 
contributed the equivalent of D71.3 million. This is in addition 
to dozens of other projects to which Kuwait has contributed more 
than D300 million. 
  On its part, Egypt is keen on elevating the level of 
economic 
exchange with Kuwait, and it seeks to increase its export rates. 
Consequently, it has established a trade center in the middle of 
the Kuwaiti capital to display Egyptian products. Sixty 
companies and factories have participated in this center. This 
is in addition to a center to provide information on Egyptian 
goods and companies. In this respect, Kuwait participated in 
1993 in the Cairo International Fair through 300 companies and 
establishments that displayed a variety of distinctive Kuwaiti 
products, embodied in textiles, consumer goods, perfumes, 
aluminum products, and fish. This demonstration was an 
opportunity for businessmen from both countries to meet and to 
agree on joint production and service projects. The Kuwaiti side 
also expressed its willingness to import more Egyptian goods and 
products. The value of such imports amounted to more than 300 
million pounds in 1993. By June 1993, total Kuwaiti investments 
in Egypt amounted to 788 million pounds, which is the equivalent 
of 16 percent of the total Arab investments in the country. 
  The two countries believe that the presence of a feeling of 
security and safety at the domestic and external levels is one 
of the most important elements that contribute to enhancing 
economic and other forms of cooperation between the two 
countries. Consequently, Egypt has received numerous Kuwaiti 
Army officers to be enrolled in training courses at specialized 
military units and institutes. Egypt also sends its experts to 
train Kuwaiti soldiers in operation the the locally-manufactured 
air defense system. 
  Regarding domestic security, cooperation between the two 
countries witnessed noticeable growth in 1993. Kuwaiti Interior 
Minister Shaykh Ahmad al-Hamud al-Jabir visited Cairo and held 
with Egyptian officials contacts that culminated in the 
conclusion of agreements in the areas of training and 
information exchange. Egypt dispatched 43 officers, ranking from 
major to brigadier general, to join the Kuwaiti State Security 
Agency and to contribute with their expertise in training their 
Kuwaiti colleagues on investigating war crimes, interrogating 
prisoners and collaborators with foreign circles, and fighting 
espionage. 
<H5>  Exchange of Convicts </H5>
  Security cooperation was coupled with cooperation in the 
legal area by virtue of the strong link between the two areas. 
This cooperation included the Kuwaiti National Assembly's 
approval of the extradition treaty between the two countries and 
the loaning of 41 Egyptian counselors to Kuwait to work in its 
various legal departments. 
  A delegation also visited Egypt in 1993 from the management 
of Kuwait's Citizen's Administration and Complaints Office. The 
delegation met with officials of the Administrative Control 
Authority, and familiarized itself with its working systems. 
  In addition to these areas of close cooperation between the 
two countries in 1993, forms of cooperation in other areas, such 
as health, also expanded. Visits between the two countries' 
physicians increased and Kuwaiti import rates of Egyptian drugs 
rose. In the area of electricity and energy, Kuwait participated 
in the construction of a number of Egyptian power plants, 
including Sidi Kurayr plant at a cost of $300 million. Kuwaiti 
electricity networks also contributed $3 million, in addition to 
building a heavy oil distillation unit at a cost of $5 million. 
  In the oil resources area, 1993 experienced constant growth 
in oil- prospecting operations carried out by Kuwaiti firms in 
Egypt, and these operations scored great success. Coordination 
continued between the two countries' officials on oil policy. 
Cooperation between trade unions in the petrochemicals area was 
also active. The Kuwaiti Government renewed the contracts of the 
Egyptian firms that participated in restoring and rehabilitating 
Kuwaiti oil wells that had been destroyed during the Iraqi 
aggression. 
<H5>  Venerable al-Azhar Delegations </H5>
  Out of awareness of the strong spiritual tie that binds the 
two countries' peoples, their two governments devoted great 
attention to this area. Delegations from the venerable al-Azhar 
visited Kuwait constantly and Cairo received increasing numbers 
of Kuwaiti students in its religious institutes.

  [Text] Cairo--The Egyptian Businessmen's Association called 
upon the Egyptian Government to embark on certain structural 
economic reforms in anticipation of the effects on the Egyptian 
economy of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] and 
in order to maximize the benefits [to Egypt] of that agreement. 
  An Association study emphasized that 95 percent of world 
trade is covered by the agreement, which is to be finalized in 
Marrakech, Morocco, in the middle of next month. It should be 
mandated, therefore, to seek to benefit by that agreement to the 
extent possible. 
  With regard to the remarks and demands that the Egyptian 
side 
could contribute before the final signing of the agreement, the 
study explained the possibility of focusing on the benefits the 
new organization, the World Trade Organization, could offer 
developing countries in terms of information on the 
implementation of the agreement, training the cadres involved 
with it in both government and private sectors, and reinforcing 
guarantees for the protection of national industries. 
  The study suggested bolstering the organizational setup that 
would monitor the domestic implementation of the agreement to 
ensure full participation by private sector institutions. 
  On the development and promotion of Egyptian exports, the 
Association called for a comprehensive strategy appropriate for 
recent developments in the world trade system. Such a strategy, 
to be devised by the private sector in partnership with state 
agencies, would focus on certain areas, such as giving exports 
priority and preferential treatment in the state's economic 
development policy, identifying the goods and services that 
offer comparative advantage in propelling the export sector and 
boosting its potential, lifting export impediments, and 
providing needed export incentives. 
  As to investments under GATT, the Association called for 
lifting trade restrictions that have a negative impact on 
foreign investments. The Egyptian Businessmen's Association 
emphasized that removing foreign investment restrictions could 
be of considerable help in boosting the activities of 
multinational corporations, especially since benefits to Egypt 
from such corporations so far have been far less than minimal. 
  The study strongly recommended adoption of the ISO 
[International Standardization Organization] 9000 system of 
standards and measures since it will be a vital component of 
future export operations. 
  The study also emphasized that the GATT-stipulated principle 
of competition in the field of services would be more beneficial 
to Egypt than harmful since Egypt is one of those countries 
whose services account for a high percentage of national income. 
Services [in Egypt] are also a major source of foreign exchange, 
especially from tourism and expatriate remittances. 
  The Businessmen's Association also called upon various 
government agencies to prepare themselves to meet the 
agreement's new requirements in order to benefit from it to the 
maximum. It pointed out that efficiency and production quality 
will be the major criteria for competition even among the 
developing nations themselves. 
  Separately, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT was told by Sa'id al-Tawil, 
president of the Egyptian Businessmen's Association, that 
reducing customs duties and other fees and opening world markets 
to Egyptian products would inevitably propel exports since 
domestic products have been encountering sizable obstacles in 
European and American markets that have not been serious in 
their commitment to international trade rules. 
  Al-Tawil elucidated: "Some may believe that reducing trade 
restrictions inherently carries negative implications for 
developing countries in general, such as exposing national 
industries, and especially nascent ones, to intense competition, 
particularly from advanced and Asian nations. Those objections, 
however, must not raise Egyptian fears because the agreement has 
given the group of developing nations, including Egypt, the 
right to protect its industries and to monitor domestic markets 
against the dumping of foreign products." 
  He pointed out that one shortcoming of the agreement is that 
it did not open the door fully to textile exports but rather 
maintained the quota system, which is to be phased out over 10 
years ending in 2004. That, however, could serve the interests 
of Egypt since the sudden abolition of quotas could expose 
Egyptian products to intense Asian competition, and since Egypt 
does not exhaust its quota. 
  It has been claimed that prices of imported farm products 
could go up when they are no longer subsidized by the advanced 
nations. Those fears may be exaggerated, however, since the 
reduction in subsidies will be no more than 20 percent and will 
be phased-in over six years. This would also be mitigated by 
other factors such the facilities granted by international world 
financial organizations. [as published] 
  On tourism, the president of the Egyptian Businessmen's 
Association pointed out that Egypt's openness to the world 
produced a large increase in the number of tourists and in 
tourism revenues. That sector was liberalized to the extent 
possible in the market while safeguarding Egyptian interests.

<F P=106> [Article by Amal Sa'd: "For First Time, Real Jobs for </F>
Graduates; Youth Still `Anxious' Over Government Employment, 
Preferring It to Private Employment; Looking for Stability, 
Family Aspect, and Insurance, Graduates Say Yes to Government 
Employment; Appointment of 55,000 Graduates to Government 
Apparatus to Meet Actual Needs at Work Sites; Conversion 
Training and Amendment of Labor Laws Are Essential for Stable 
Labor Market"] 
  [Text] Within the context of the government policy to 
create real work opportunities for the youth, the Ministry of 
Manpower announced that it has agreed to hire 55,000 college and 
high school graduates who have graduated since 1983 in an effort 
to break the unemployment siege from which youth suffer. Are 
there actual specialized positions and jobs awaiting these youth 
or will the appointees turn into more of the masked unemployed 
with which ministries and government agencies abound? Is there 
demand for appointment? How will the appointees be treated in 
terms of salaries and social allowances? How did the youth spend 
the recent years before their turn to be appointed arrived? 
<H5>  Appointment to Real Jobs </H5>
  Muhammad Amin Mahfuz, general director of employment at the 
Ministry of Manpower, has said, "For the first time, this year 
we are following a new policy of appointment to real jobs in 
order to meet actual needs. Youth with high school diplomas will 
be appointed according to grade point average and those with 
college degrees, according to general evaluation. Unlike what 
happened in past years, not all graduates of the same year will 
be appointed, because this system has proved to be a failure and 
because it has resulted in masked unemployment that saddles the 
government with enormous financial burdens, with nothing 
produced in return. This year, there is an actual need to make a 
total of 54,066 appointments in order to meet the shortage in a 
number of government agencies, including the Ministry of 
Education, al-Azhar, local government agencies, the Ministries 
of Health, Social Affairs, and Agriculture, the Public Book 
Authority, and the Higher Youth and Sports Council. The Ministry 
is committed to making these appointments by the end of April. 
The Domestic Employment Department has prepared its plan to 
complete the appointment of graduates from among the graduates 
of 1983 to 1993. Different levels of qualification are required 
from the classes graduating in different years. [High school and 
college level] qualifications are required of 1983 graduates. 
College degrees are required of 1984 graduates (like this year's 
main class). From the years 1985 to 1993, honors graduates are 
needed. 
  "For example, graduates of Islamic law colleges, law 
schools, 
arts sections, documentation, and library sections from 1984 to 
1993 [will be appointed]. Graduates of 1992 were appointed last 
year, and 1993 graduates, as well as graduates from previous 
years who haven't been given jobs, will be appointed this year. 
Graduates of English, Arabic, French, and other language 
sections and of al-Azhar colleges from 1984 to 1992 will also be 
appointed. The required number of appointees from each 
educational level will be selected according to specialization 
and from the year entitled to appointment, and then from 
subsequent years." 
<H5>  New Unemployment </H5>
  "Even though this new system will, as Muhammad Mahfuz says, 
eliminate the masked unemployment phenomenon because it calls 
for appointment to meet actual needs, it may lead to 
unemployment among graduates of colleges which aren't in demand, 
such as schools of arts and oriental language schools. This 
requires correction of the educational direction (as a long-term 
plan) to make it compatible with the market's actual needs and 
to give the new generations skills that enable them to work for 
themselves on the one hand and, on the other hand, to create new 
venues for the appointment of these graduates in small projects. 
  "This correction also requires focusing on the role of 
conversion training to divert employees toward truly productive 
jobs and to create private sector associations so each 
association will appoint its own members, solve their problems, 
conduct feasibility studies for their projects, and train them. 
There is no doubt that the ministry has a role to play in 
drafting plans for projects to be undertaken by graduates. A 
conversion training plan (for a two-month training course) has 
been prepared with the Ministry of Education for graduates of 
psychology, philosophy, and oriental languages so they will be 
trained on documentation and library tasks and will work as 
librarians. No plan has been drawn up yet for graduates of other 
theoretical colleges and high schools. However, there is an 
urgent need for such a plan, especially when we learn that high 
school graduates represent 75 percent of the unemployed 
[graduates] generally. College graduates represent just 12 
percent and graduates with above high school diplomas represent 
the remaining 13 percent. We must note here, as the general 
director of internal employment has said, that vocational 
conversion training must be compatible with every group of 
graduates independently. Else, we must enhance the qualification 
level of the graduates of each group within their own 
specialization so as to make them compatible with the private 
sector's needs. 
  "As for the financial position of the graduates who are to 
be 
appointed, they will collect the established salaries, namely 
64.80 [pounds] as a basic salary for college graduates and 51.30 
pounds as a basic salary for graduates with high school 
diplomas. Social and periodic allowances will be certainly added 
to these salaries. Law No. 47 of 1978 will apply to the 
appointees and they will be granted legal seniority as of 1 
February 1994, giving them the full opportunity to receive their 
first allowance as of 1 July 1995." 
<H5>  Demand for Appointment </H5>
  As to the degree of demand for these appointments, Mahmud 
'Askar, chairman of the section for appointment of graduates 
with a business diploma at the Ministry of Manpower, has said 
that there is an extremely strong demand for the jobs and that 
some of the applicants are unemployed and others are actually 
employed in the private sector but wish to either combine this 
employment with government employment or to completely give up 
the former and take up the latter. Some of the applicants even 
avoid making insurance payments of their own volition and avoid 
insuring themselves while employed in the private sector so as 
to get the opportunity for government employment when their turn 
comes. It is well known that an insured private-sector worker is 
totally excluded from government employment. Moreover, we do not 
exaggerate if we assert that some groups, especially 
self-employed free professionals, avoid insuring themselves so 
as to get an opportunity to work for the government and then to 
carry on with their self-employment after official work hours. 
  'Askar went on to add that all applications will be checked 
by computer at the Ministry of Social Affairs to verify whether 
applicants are or are not actually employed, so vacant positions 
will be filled by the unemployed and not by people who wish to 
combine two jobs. 
<H5>  Youths' Opinion </H5>
  We had to interview a sampling of the youth who have applied 
for appointment, especially 1983 or 1984 graduates who have 
spent nearly 10 years awaiting a letter from the Ministry of 
Manpower and who have been forced to take up jobs totally 
unrelated to their specializations. To begin, we assert that 
clinging to government employment has been the basic thread 
binding all graduates we have interviewed. However, their 
justifications and their wishes vary in this regard. Some wish 
to give up their private sector work altogether and others wish 
to combine it with government employment. 
  'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Atiyah Muhammad, who got a BS in chemistry in 
1984, works as a railroad conductor. He has said, "My wages from 
my work amount to 200 pounds monthly because I get additional 
wages for fines that I collect. I know that my government salary 
will not amount to one-half this sum. However, I wish to work in 
my field of specialization, which I love, and I am prepared to 
give up my current job for its sake." 
  Layla Mahmud al-Qirabi, who got a licence [equivalent of MA] 
in English literature in 1989, works as a switch operator at a 
major hotel and earns 350 pounds monthly. She wishes to work as 
a teacher, and she is willing to accept a salary that will not 
exceed 86 pounds under any circumstance. She has said, "I have 
to sacrifice the big salary from my current job because this job 
requires me to work evening and morning shifts, which isn't 
convenient to me as a wife and a mother. I am looking for 
government work that ensures me comfort, regular work hours, and 
maternity leave." 
  Ramzi Judah 'Abd-al-Baqi, who got a business diploma in 
1983, 
is a citizen of al-Sharqiyah Governorate. He has been unable to 
work in his governorate due to the lack of employment 
opportunities there. So, he came to Cairo and worked at a 
restaurant and confectionery. When his turn to be appointed by 
the Ministry of Manpower came, he did not hesitate to apply and 
to express his willingness to leave his current job, which pays 
him 300 pounds monthly. Ramzi justifies his willingness by 
pointing out that his work is extremely demanding and that he 
works 12-15 hours daily. Moreover, he feels that the job is 
unstable and insecure and he fears that the business owner may 
terminate his contract at any moment. 
<H5>  Family Appearance </H5>
  Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Sa'idi, who obtained a business 
diploma 
in 1983 and who works as a tile layer, has said, "I hate this 
job. I have been forced to work in it in order to spend on my 
needs. I collect 20 pounds daily or 600 pounds monthly. But now 
I wish to work in my field of specialization so as to preserve 
proper family and social appearances." 
  Mujdi Mahmud, who received a BA in commerce and business 
management in 1984 and who works as a teacher at a private 
school, wishes to be appointed by the Ministry of Manpower so he 
can get his full due, in terms of promotion, allowances, and the 
right to do rotations, plus wages for the entire year. In his 
current position, Mahmud gets no salary for the school summer 
vacation months. 
  Nabil Khalifah, a French language graduate in 1985, works as 
a security officer at a major five-star hotel. He has said, "I 
don't wish to give up my current job, in which my work ends at 
0600. I can then go to my government job and secure a reasonable 
monthly salary with which to face the high cost of living. 
Moreover, government jobs are stable." 
  Samir Fadil 'Abd-al-Jawad, who got a BS in geology in 1984 
and who works as a typist at a private company, has said, "I 
wish to work in the government in the morning and then carry on 
with my current job after the official work hours because this 
job is a source of livelihood for me and my family. This is, in 
any case, better than going abroad." 
<H5>  Problem of Laws </H5>
  Dr. 'Izzah Karim, a sociologist at the National Social and 
Criminal Research Center, has said, "In the youth's mind, 
employment in the private or public sector has a specific 
significance and specific logic that are based on the Egyptian 
society's laws and circumstances. The pursuit of government jobs 
started with the inception of the 1952 revolution and with 
application of the socialist system. This system strengthens the 
government sector with laws that regulate it and ensure a stable 
monthly salary, insurance, and pensions in case of sickness or 
death. These laws do not permit the dismissal of a worker except 
under extreme circumstances, and they do not require full and 
conditional productivity. These guarantees motivate the youth to 
seek government employment. This is in contrast with the private 
sector whose regulations cause the youth constant anxiety, even 
though this sector's wages are high. But the wage may be 
unstable and may depend on profit. Moreover, the assurances that 
the private sector worker gets may not be enough to make this 
worker feel secure about his future and old age. Therefore, 
youth cannot be blamed if they are determined to pursue 
government employment. 
  "As for combining private and government employment, it can 
be excusable despite its numerous demerits--most significant of 
which is that the worker is required to exert a redoubled effort 
which could damage his health and cause him to be delinquent in 
performing his duties to himself, his family, and his society. 
Another demerit is that this worker denies other unemployed 
people the opportunity for real employment at a time when we are 
experiencing high unemployment. If we view this matter more 
logically, we can perhaps find an excuse for youth who do not 
wish to tackle the difficult task of balancing a rewarding 
income from the private sector on the one hand with security and 
stability from government employment on the other hand." 
<H5>  Wasteful Spending </H5>
  Here, Dr. 'Izzah Karim raises another point connected with 
the same issue, namely the years spent by the youth while 
waiting for appointment. These years are either spent in true 
unemployment--and there is no doubt that 10 years of 
unemployment are sure to destroy the youth educationally and 
psychologically and to turn them into a time bomb threatening to 
explode at any moment because the youth feel intellectually 
empty and unable to contribute to society--or spent in a job 
totally unrelated to the youth's specialization and field of 
studies. Even though this is less harmful than complete 
unemployment, it is still an enormous problem because it 
represents money spent wastefully by the government. This is a 
problem because it means that all the money spent on the student 
throughout the various phases of education goes to waste and no 
benefit is derived from this spending. Moreover, the worker 
[graduate student] works in a job he does not like, to which he 
does not belong, that does not satisfy his identity, and that 
afflicts him with psychological diseases that make him want to 
retaliate against society. This is definitely a problem of a 
government that grants high school certificates and that does 
not create work opportunities to absorb people with such 
certificates, despite the numerous work opportunities in Egypt. 
We should keep in mind that we live on just 4 percent of Egypt's 
area and that the other 96 percent remains unproductive and 
absorbs no manpower. Thus, the problem lies in the poor 
population distribution and not in population growth. 
  Finally, the sociologist at the National Social Research 
Center offers a prescription to overcome this crisis that Egypt 
experiences annually. She says that the solution lies in two 
things: first, have the government begin drafting public sector 
laws that protect this sector's labor at all levels so people 
will seek employment in the sector seriously and more 
courageously. The problem is a problem of laws and not of the 
nature of work in the sector. 
  Second, attention must not be confined to the overcrowded 
mother governorates but must be directed to the new governorates 
that are capable of absorbing the youth's capabilities and that 
can employ the youth and enable him to achieve immense 
productivity far from the government sector.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi Radi, Egyptian </F>
minister of public works and water resources, by Salah Bidaywi; 
in Cairo, date not given--first six paragraphs are AL-SHA'B 
introduction] 
  [Text] A few short months ago, Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi 
Radi was put at the head of the Ministry of Irrigation [title as 
published]. He stated immediately after assuming his duties that 
Egypt does not have one spare drop of water it can give to the 
Zionist entity. He also launched extensive dialogues with 
Egypt's African partners in the Nile basin in order to realize 
his long-stated objective of cooperation among those nations. 
  Dr. Radi spent his youthful years conducting studies at 
water 
research institutions. Two years before he was given the 
[Irrigation] portfolio, he was given responsibility for the 
Encased Drainage Agency [title as published] and was selected to 
be deputy minister of irrigation. 
  The minister of irrigation told AL-SHA'B that he will 
provide 
water for only 2,500 feddans in Sinai through the year 1997 when 
work on digging the Peace Canal would have been completed. This 
means that in the absence of an alternative to absorb the 
present inhabitants of central Sinai, they would have to be 
evacuated, leaving the area as a ready-to-serve meal, which the 
enemy may readily gobble up. Studies, on the other hand, confirm 
that central Sinai holds enough subterranean water to irrigate 1 
million feddans annually and to settle hundreds of thousands in 
dozens of new urban communities in central Sinai. 
  The minister reiterated his unwillingness to supply the 
Zionist enemy with a single drop of water and denied that it 
poses any threat to Nile sources or that it has attempted to 
pilfer Sinai water. 
  The minister said that the public interest of the motherland 
requires him to stay clear from the details of cooperation with 
the Africans [as published] and their relationships with the 
Zionists because all those concerned would get upset and do not 
believe that opposition media should exist in the Third World. 
  In point of fact, the minister was congenial to the extreme, 
but congeniality is not what national interests are about. I 
interviewed him twice for one and one-half hours, but he 
ultimately preferred to respond to written questions. I wrote 
the questions and left them for him. He answered and I left his 
office with his answers, but I was not totally happy with [his 
response]. I believe that his actions belied the esteem he 
professed for AL-SHA'B. 
  [Bidaywi] We were delighted by your recent statement that 
you 
refuse to allow one drop of water outside Egyptian [borders]. 
Would you elucidate for us the scope of the current Zionist 
strategy to envelope the sources of Arab water in southeast 
Anatolia and in the Ethiopian plateau? And what about Ethiopia's 
dams, foreign bureau studies in their regard, and their funding 
by international institutions? What are your views on the 
al-Salaam [Peace] water pipeline proposed by Turkey for the 
Middle East? What is new with regard to Zionist cooperation with 
Ethiopia and other nations of the Nile Basin? 
  [Radi] In all aspects of water resources Egypt focuses on 
the 
Nile as its main artery of water. Egypt's primary orientation, 
of course, is to foster constant and constructive cooperation 
with Nile Basin nations and to seek a suitable format for 
comprehensive cooperation in order to maximize the benefits of 
that river to all its peoples. We felt during our numerous 
meetings with Basin countries that all of them are likewise keen 
on the same objective. 
  In light of that keenness, the various countries of the Nile 
Basin have adopted positions rooted in non-interference with the 
strong fraternal relations that presently exist. Therefore, as 
far as we know, there is no foreign intervention with impact on 
the Nile Basin. We have no fear of that because our confidence 
in ourselves and in our brethren propels actions rooted in 
constructive cooperation that would serve mutual interests 
without abridging the rights of any party or undermining any of 
those rights. 
  As to Arab waters, the precept is that everyone should 
receive his entitlement and that occupation does not justify 
usurping the rights of owners of motherlands. 
  None of the studies and other research by foreign bureaus 
and 
others are mandates. They are merely personal initiatives by 
their sponsors. The basic notion is respect for rights, 
commitment to principles, and organized recognition of water use. 
  The previously proposed al-Salaam Turkish pipeline project 
is 
a political project in the sense that we don't believe in its 
technical or economic feasibility. Desalinating sea water is 
more feasible technically and economically and can be done 
within a state's borders and would therefore be easily 
controlled. 
  [Bidaywi] Your studies published under the title "Water and 
Peace" discussed cooperation between Egypt and Nile Basin 
countries. Have you translated them into reality? How do the 
Africans justify their cooperation with the Zionists? What 
progress has been made in making water projects more productive 
in the Upper Nile? Also, what about the High Dam project, the 
removal of silt from its reservoir, and the true nature of 
refurbishment there? 
  [Radi] The primary objective of the "Water and Peace" 
studies 
originally published in 1985 was to alert domestic and regional 
public opinion to the urgency of water issues and to the value 
of organizing, developing, and safeguarding our water resources. 
  The studies also advanced a collection of strategies 
proposed 
by their author. We seek, within a context of integration and 
coordination with all the other agencies, to implement those 
strategies that are appropriate at this time. 
  We have already begun to move in that direction in Ethiopia, 
and we hope that such moves will be fruitful. 
  As to the question of silt in the High Dam reservoir, this 
is 
a matter currently under study by the Ministry's research 
agencies. Experimental projects will also explore uses for that 
silt and, once their viability is proved, will be implemented on 
a wider scale. It will be four or five years, however, before 
these experimental studies are completed. 
  We have talked a lot about the High Dam, which will ever 
remain the center of and the basis for development in Egypt. It 
has been proved beyond doubt that its negative impact, decried 
by some, has been very limited and is fully under control. 
<H5>  Important Issues </H5>
  [Bidaywi] How do you assess Libya's Great Manmade River 
project and the dam that Sudan is building across the Nile? Do 
these two projects threaten Egypt in any way? 
  [Radi] The Libyan river is a project that the Libyan 
Government finds necessary to deal with water shortages and has 
therefore allocated for it all the funds it takes, without 
regard to economic value. Continued development and life require 
a shift of focus from economic feasibility alone. 
  The Nile Water Organization had previously debated the 
proposed al-Hamdab Dam project in the Sudan and concluded that 
it would be beneficial for the Sudanese people. The project does 
not abridge Egyptian rights as long as the amount of water 
utilized for it does not exceed Sudan's assigned water quota 
under its 1959 agreement with Egypt. 
  [Bidaywi] How do you plan to provide water for reclamation 
and agrarian development projects through the year 2000? What's 
new with the project to collect water at the northern lakes? How 
about the reservations expressed in that regard? 
  [Radi] The expansion and reclamation plan through the year 
2000 calls for reclaiming some 1.6 million feddans, which would 
require some 8.8 billion cubic meters annually. Irrigation water 
will consist of drainage water, mixed with some 5.3 billion 
[cubic meters] of fresh water annually. 
  [Bidaywi] There has been a lot of discussion about the Peace 
Canal and its current track. Do you have confidence in that 
course and why? Also, how will it be possible to irrigate 
al-'Arish and central Sinai lands whose area is said to exceed 5 
million feddans? What have you done about well-digging projects 
in central Sinai? What have you done with plans to dig wells in 
central Sinai and build dams so that the population is not 
forced out by the Peace Canal in the north? Is it true what 
expert studies have confirmed that the enemy pilfers 50,000 
cubic meters daily of Sinai's subterranean water? How can this 
be dealt with and utilized to the benefit of Egypt? Do the 
Zionists have a role in the system for designing [as published] 
al-Salaam Canal and its networks? What exactly is the Ministry's 
role in that regard? 
  [Radi] Plans for Peace Canal to be built east of the [Suez] 
Canal were drawn by the Ministry of Water Resources in 1975. 
Another study followed in 1978 titled "Horizontal Expansion in 
an Area of 2.8 Million Feddans; Planning for the Canal." This is 
considered to be the optimum plan and [calls for] terminating 
the Canal at al-'Arish City. 
  As to Ministry plans for wells and holding dams in order to 
develop the region, 52 wells are being dug across central Sinai 
and will be completed over a five-year period ending in 1997 and 
will perennially irrigate some 2,500 feddans. The settlement of 
habitants have actually begun in al-Magharah, Jabal-al-Halal, 
Umm-al-Shahhan, and 'Arid-al-Naqah. We have also completed the 
construction of six underground reservoirs, with a capacity of 
600 cubic meters each, in al-Jurafi Valley (al-Kantalah) in 
order to store rain and torrent waters for drinking purposes. 
Presently under study are 14 dams in al-Jurafi region which 
would make it possible to utilize rain and reservoir waters for 
irrigating certain areas and for feeding the underground 
reservoir instead of being lost to the sea. 
  About enemy exploitation of subterranean water--studies 
proved that there is no extraction across the Sinai border. 
  [Bidaywi] The International Monetary Fund is maintaining 
intense pressure on our country to exact a price for irrigation 
water, and the government is using all kinds of pretexts to 
delay action on issue. What are your views and why do Ministry 
of Irrigation agencies insist on metering the wells being dug on 
new lands? Are there plans to charge a price in the future? 
  [Radi] There are no current or future plans to charge for 
water, and this is final. Metering wells is an operational 
procedure to control water extraction and avoid depleting the 
wells or salinating their content. This in no way means a charge 
for the water. Let us emphasize once and for all that irrigation 
water will not be subject to a charge of any kind, now or in the 
future. 
  [Bidaywi] How about the development of irrigation networks 
in 
older lands? What system will be utilized? What will the costs 
be and how will they be covered? What progress has been made in 
the construction of encased drainage networks and in the 
agrarian utilization of encased drainage water and subterranean 
water? 
  [Radi] The main objective of developing irrigation networks 
in older lands is to reduce water loss and consequently raise 
the efficiency of irrigation systems. 
  Some 390,000 feddans are undergoing development, and the 
project will save some 3 million cubic meters of water by the 
end of plan when the development is completed of about 4.7 
million feddans in Lower Egypt and al-Fayyum. The cost of 
developing the 390,000 feddan area is estimated at about 1,800 
Egyptian pounds per feddan. 
  As to encased drainage networks, the Ministry's plan hopes 
to 
supply some 5.6 million feddans of farmland with encased 
drainage networks at a cost of 875 million Egyptian pounds. 
Public drainage facilities will also be deepened and enlarged at 
a cost of some 820 million Egyptian pounds. 
  [Bidaywi] Do any relations exist in any manner between 
Ministry of Irrigation agencies and the Zionist entity? If so, 
what are they and what are their purpose and objectives? Were 
any mutual cooperation projects brought to your attention? 
  [Radi] The relations between counterparts anywhere in the 
world are based on mutual interests and the realization of 
assured benefits, provided there are interrelated interests and 
also interrelated circumstances. 
  Egypt's water systems are different from all other such 
systems in the region and consequently no areas of potential 
cooperation currently exist. 
  [Bidaywi] Farmers were surprised at your cooperation with 
the 
Ministry of Agriculture and we were all happy as a result 
because of the benefits that would accrue to our beloved Egypt 
as it suffers a severe irrigation water shortage that has 
already caused great harm to wheat crops in Lower Egypt and 
Bani-Suwayf. What is the real cause of the crisis? Has it 
dissipated? 
  [Radi] There were two main reasons for the water crisis that 
occurred. The first was that the country's weather was unusually 
warm this year and temperatures were higher than their mean. The 
second was that the customary amount of rain did not fall on 
Lower Egypt this year. Meteorological measures indicate that 
rain fell considerably short of its mean. The two factors 
together caused a considerable and unusual depletion of farmland 
soil moisture, causing farmers to double the amount of 
irrigation water used in previous years. Add to this the 
psychological state of farmers, which also led then to higher 
water consumption. 
  [Bidaywi] Does the Ministry of Irrigation have any fiscal 
problems in funding the al-Salaam Canal project? 
  [Radi] Funding for all irrigation projects in general is 
adequate for the time being and will be increased in the future 
as our needs increase. The al-Salaam Canal has no funding 
problems. 
  [Bidaywi] How about Ministry of Irrigation relations with 
the 
Sudan and with other Arab states? 
  [Radi] Ministry of Irrigation relations with the brotherly 
Sudan have since the dawn of time been fraternal and based on 
mutual benefits linked by Nile waters. As to the other Arab 
states, technical cooperation exists at the highest levels of 
various Ministry departments as do exchanges in the fields of 
training and technical expertise.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Tourism Dr. Mamduh al-Biltaji, </F>
by Sa'id Shalash in Cairo; date not given--first two paragraphs 
are AL-MAJALLAH introduction] 
  [Text] When Egypt's political leadership selected Dr. 
Mamduh al-Biltaji, the Public Information Authority chairman, to 
be appointed minister of tourism in Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's latest 
cabinet, some people wondered about the connection with tourism 
of a man who has spent his entire life in the information field. 
For tourism to be successful, it has to be managed by an 
economist. Those who hold this opinion are justified, especially 
since Dr. al-Biltaji has assumed responsibility of the Ministry 
of Tourism after one of the most successful ministers of Dr. 
'Atif Sidqi's cabinet, namely Minister Fu'ad Sultan who was able 
to realize for Egypt a revenue of $2.5 billion from tourism in 
1992. Minister Sultan encouraged the private sector to invest in 
tourism, thus giving it a great boost. He was also the first man 
to call for specialization in the tourism sector. Sultan is a 
well-known banker who is acknowledged for his capability. 
  What many do not know is that the new minister of tourism 
has 
a doctorate in economics and another in political science. With 
his experience in information, Dr. al-Biltaji has mastered the 
art of dealing with domestic and foreign media people as a 
result of long years of work (17 years) that have tied him to 
these people. Such a man is needed now, especially since 
Egyptian tourism is experiencing a deep crisis that has reduced 
tourism revenues from $2.5 billion to $2.1 billion. This crisis 
has resulted from the terrorist acts that have been perpetrated 
in Egypt. The Western media has played a major role in 
exaggerating these acts. As a consequence, tourism firms have 
excluded Egypt from their program for this year. However, there 
is an $42-million plan to make up for these losses, according to 
Dr. al-Biltaji. Following is the text of the interview: 
  [Shalash] Since you assumed responsibility of the Egyptian 
Ministry of Tourism, you have been declaring that this ministry 
seeks to turn tourism into the locomotive pulling Egypt's 
development and that you will enhance tourism, which has been in 
a crisis as a result of two consecutive blows: the Kuwait 
liberation war and the terrorist acts of the fall and winter of 
1992--acts which persist to this day. So, how do you envision 
accomplishing these goals, and how will tourism become the 
development locomotive in a country with a population of 60 
million people? 
  [al-Biltaji] When I said that tourism is the locomotive that 
pulls development in Egypt, I was fully aware of what I was 
saying. I still say the same thing and I work for its 
implementation. I mean by this that tourism isn't just a 
railroad car in the development train but the locomotive that 
pulls the entire train, without replacing any of its cars. The 
foreign currency revenue basket is supplied by three elements, 
namely: the Suez Canal, remittances from expatriate workers, and 
tourism. Tourism possesses characteristics that make it eligible 
to outdistance and surpass other small elements of foreign 
revenue, because tourism is an immediately exportable product. 
Consequently, the element of time is, in this case, immediately 
embodied economically and financially. In other words, I can 
export tourism immediately, because the product is ready. This 
is the first thing. 
  Second, tourism, remittances from expatriate Egyptians, Suez 
Canal revenues, and oil revenues constitute altogether the four 
elements of which the big-four assembly consists. The difference 
is that tourism is not depletable, has no ceiling, and isn't 
susceptible to labor market fluctuations. 
  Third, tourism is a labor-intensive industry, meaning that 
one tourist creates work opportunities for 1.7 citizens. There 
is also the so-called tourism multiplier. This multiplier is a 
very large group of industries and crafts that develop and grow 
the more active tourism becomes. 
  Tourism isn't just hotels, restaurants, airplane tickets, 
and 
buses, but also an integrated number of industries: moquette, 
rugs, chinaware, bed covers, tables, spare parts, soap, and 
detergents. This means laborers, carpenters, boatmen, smelters, 
plumbers, machinists, drivers, cooks, and employees. 
  [Shalash] What are the true losses that have emanated from 
the crisis Egyptian tourism is experiencing? 
  [al-Biltaji] Last year, 1993, we lost $1.5 billion. In 1992, 
revenues were $2.5 billion. Perhaps the serious nature of the 
terrorist acts and their reverberations in the Western media 
have intensified the crisis of Egyptian tourism and resulted in 
a big drop in the demand for Egyptian tourist sites. This crisis 
has motivated some tour organizers and international tourist 
firms to exclude Egypt from their marketing programs. If demand 
continues to be low, Egypt will continue to be excluded from 
international marketing programs (group tours), and this would 
harbor serious harbingers of future demand, and even of future 
investment in the Egyptian tourism sector. Subsequently, the 
other sectors tied to the tourism sector, such as vocational, 
industrial, commercial, and banking activities, will also be 
affected. 
  [Shalash] What is your plan to boost tourism in the coming 
phase under the canopy of attacks that continue to be committed 
against tourists in Upper Egypt? 
  [al-Biltaji] Terrorist acts against tourists are few if 
compared with other countries where similar incidents occur. To 
date, only three tourists have been hurt. I blame the Western 
media, but not all of them, for the way they describe the 
incidents. I have actually met with foreign reporters in Egypt 
and explained to them the dimensions of what has happened. There 
is a demand on the international media to make the scoop and to 
be the front runner in reporting developments. If information 
isn't supplied to the media, they will gather it from any source 
that may misinterpret the information and may misdirect it. 
Every media person has an urgent need for information, and one 
can either provide him with the information or he will gather it 
any way he can. 
  The plan to boost tourism that we have drafted for 1994 is 
based on increasing demand and on promoting the investment and 
development opportunities in our tourist areas. The plan also 
offers projects in these area to likely investors all over the 
world, meaning that it promotes the demand side and exerts 
efforts for the supply side in the tourism equation. The plan 
devotes concerted attention to boosting demand in six major 
international markets that export tourists to Egypt, namely the 
United States, Germany, Italy, France, and Japan [no sixth 
market mentioned]. 
  [Shalash] What is this plan's total budget? 
  [al-Biltaji] It is estimated at $42 million. 
  [Shalash] How will this sum be secured? 
  [al-Biltaji] From the state's public treasury, the Tourism 
Fund, and the private tourism sector. The government has 
actually agreed to supply the full sum, and implementation of 
the plan has already started. By the end of 1994, the plan seeks 
to achieve the peak revenue of 1992, i.e., $2.1 billion instead 
of the $1.3 billion achieved in 1993. 
  [Shalash] What will be the focus of activity in the targeted 
markets? 
  [al-Biltaji] To amend Egypt's image; to put terrorist acts 
within their correct context and dimensions; to appeal to the 
consumer directly through television and through specialized and 
unspecialized major press and news agencies; to strengthen the 
bond with conventional channels of distribution, such as tour 
organizers, travel agents, incentive-offering houses, conference 
organizers, and airline associations and companies; to enhance 
the standard of materials used to boost sales; to implement a 
program to market the Egyptian tourist product; to utilize the 
system of tourist convoys; to participate in international 
conferences; to draft a well-studied program to invite leaders 
in the field of tourism; and to establish a mechanism for 
periodic followup. 
  [Shalash] Where does Arab tourism fall on the Egyptian 
tourism-boosting map? Has Arab tourism been affected by the 
latest terrorist acts, and has the Arab media performed the same 
role performed by some Western media? 
  [al-Biltaji] The Arab market has its special characteristic 
and it is an important market in exporting tourists to Egypt. 
The plan takes into account the need to exert concerted efforts 
in this market, using the proper instruments, such as tourist 
convoys and host programs. The plan also takes into account 
intensified contacts with official and professional circles and 
increased reliance on the satellite television channel and on 
Egyptian radio and press. At the same time, the plan disregards 
some high-cost promotion instruments, such as television 
commercials, press advertisements, and tourism-promotion 
offices. This is why we have decided to shut down the Egyptian 
Tourism Office in Kuwait. 
  Arab tourism to Egypt represents 40 percent of the 
international tourist traffic coming into our country. The 
effect on Arab tourism has been slight when compared to the drop 
in other markets. 
  The Egyptian minister asserted that the importance of Arab 
tourism to Egypt surpasses economic and social considerations. 
Tourism is a main element that bolsters solidarity and 
understanding, and "we urge Egyptian citizens to go for tourism 
in the Arab countries, because an Arab tourist in Egypt and an 
Egyptian tourist in the Arab world is a citizen primarily. An 
Arab tourist in Egypt is a first-class citizen and a tourist who 
comes to his history and his environment and who deals with a 
society that favors and welcomes him. 
  As for the Arab media, they have been committed to the truth 
since the start of the terrorist acts, except for a few. I meet 
with Arab reporters in Cairo, and I have been tied to them by 
good relations, since I was head of the Information Authority 
throughout recent years. 
  [Shalash] You have signed an agreement with Israel and 
Turkey 
to establish the East Mediterranean Tourism Organization. But 
there are fears that Israel will deal a blow to Egyptian tourism 
in particular. Fears abound these days among ordinary Egyptians 
that Israel has had a role in the latest developments [terrorist 
acts], especially since the success of ASTA [American Society of 
Travel Agents] 1992 and Egypt's excellent rise on the world's 
tourism map have disturbed many of the region's tourist 
countries? 
  [al-Biltaji] There is absolutely no fear of cooperation with 
Israel in this regard, because Egypt's tourism resources are 
unrivaled. Egypt possesses one-third of the world's antiquities, 
and it possesses natural elements, such as sun, air, shores, and 
hospitable people, that are rarely found in another country. 
  [Shalash] What is tourism's position in the political 
leadership's mind? 
  [al-Biltaji] President Mubarak devotes great attention to 
tourism, and he goes personally to tourist sites in Luxor and 
the Red Sea to encourage greatly tourism investors visiting 
Egypt. 
  [Shalash] Tourism development activity in new tourist sites 
was at the peak of success prior to 1993. Has investment and 
development activity declined by the same degree as tourist 
numbers and tourism revenues? 
  [al-Biltaji] Investment activity hasn't been affected by the 
latest developments. The government has issued a number of laws 
and regulations that ensure that the wheel of development keeps 
on turning and that encourage the private sector to participate 
effectively in this area. Incentives include free foreign 
exchange transactions and unrestricted remittance of profits to 
the outside world; the right of non-Egyptians to fully own 
investment projects; tax exemptions for profits emanating from 
tourist project expansions; and exemption from the proportionate 
revenue tax, from registration, documentation, and announcement 
fees for all contracts connected with the project. The 
incentives also include the levying of a uniform customs fee 
amounting to 5 percent of the value of goods and equipment 
imported for a project. Moreover, the incentives make it 
impermissible to seize or confiscate the assets of investment 
firms and give these firms the right to re-export their full 
capital. 
  The above incentives come on top of other facilities, such 
as 
sale and lease to investors at token prices, the investor's 
freedom to determine the price of his services and his profits 
without intervention by the government, and the easy and prompt 
acquisition of approvals and permits for tourist projects. 
  [Shalash] The Ministry of Aviation has been separated from 
the Ministry of Tourism in the latest Cabinet. The Civil 
Aviation Authority has been placed under the control of the 
Ministry of Transport; Cairo Airport and Air Egypt have been 
placed under Cabinet control. Moreover, tourist companies and 
hotels have, under the canopy of the new specialization laws, 
been placed under the control of the public business sector. 
Will this result in lack of coordination between these sectors, 
even though they all serve the same thing, namely tourism, or is 
there coordination among you? 
  [al-Biltaji] Coordination is extant and ongoing. We all 
cooperate for what is in the interest of Egypt and its 
prosperity. When a problem develops, we do actually form a joint 
aviation-tourism committee to examine it. 
  [Shalash] Give me an example. 
  [al-Biltaji] There is the "chartered" flights problem that 
developed recently when the Civil Aviation Authority refused to 
permit tourist-carrying "chartered" flights to land in 
al-Ghardaqah on the grounds that laws don't empower it to permit 
such landings. I intervened immediately and the flights were 
permitted to land because the interest of tourism comes first. 
The committee we formed of the Ministry of Tourism, the Aviation 
Authority, and Air Egypt drafted rules to regulate "chartered" 
flight activity in a way that ensures the national company's 
right, i.e., Air Egypt's right, and the rights of the Egyptian 
and foreign private sector companies. I believe in the policy of 
open skies. 
  [Shalash] It seems from this interview that you are more 
optimistic than you should. 
  [al-Biltaji] Yes, I am optimistic. Egyptian tourism activity 
will regain its normal rates soon.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Adil al-Bahnasawi: "While Awaiting Political </F>
Decision, Energy and Oil Experts Urge Government To Adopt 
Nuclear Plan and To Implement It Immediately"] 
  [Text] AL-SHA'B continues to sound the alarm regarding one 
of Egypt's most important economic and social independence 
issues, namely the issue of our peaceful plan to generate 
electricity from nuclear energy. The Egyptian Government closed 
this plan's dossier under pressure from a number of 
international circles, despite repeated appeals by Egyptian 
nuclear energy experts stressing the inevitable entry into this 
strategic field. 
  At the end of last month, the Arab Mining and Petroleum 
Association held a symposium, entitled "Energy and Constant 
Development Challenges," that was attended by a large number of 
petroleum, electricity, and nuclear plant experts. They included 
Dr. Hafiz Hajji, chairman of the Nuclear Plants Authority 
[agency name as published]; Dr. Nabil al-Hadhiq, chairman of the 
Nuclear Materials Authority; Dr. Mustafa Suwaydan, deputy 
chairman of the Egyptian Electricity Studies Authority; Engineer 
Mahmud Sami Zaffun, chairman of the New and Renewable Energy 
Authority; Dr. Husayn 'Abd-al-Muhsin, former chairman of the 
Nuclear Materials Authority; and a large number of people 
concerned with energy in Egypt. 
  Most of the experts' debates were on the issue of nuclear 
energy in Egypt. Upon concluding its meeting, the first 
recommendation the symposium made was that it is inevitable that 
we enter the nuclear age peacefully as of now so we can meet the 
coming oil shortage in Egypt. The same thing was stressed by 
petroleum experts who announced that Egypt's oil reserves will 
hardly last 30-40 years. Some experts referred to the petroleum 
minister's statement that "oil reserve is a dynamic reserve, 
meaning that it increases at times as a result of new finds." 
These experts have said that even if the reserve increases as a 
result of new finds, it will be depleted some day, and this has 
been confirmed by the reports of Egypt's Higher Energy Council. 
  Dr. Husayn 'Abd-al-Muhsin, former chairman of the Nuclear 
Materials Authority, said that officials must move promptly to 
make the political decision immediately because we already have 
studies in place. Moreover, it is important to begin 
implementation now because the construction of a nuclear plant 
takes 10 years, considering that bids have to be invited and 
agreements concluded, all of which takes years. This is what 
makes us declare that this plan has to be started now. 
  In this report, AL-SHA'B presents the latest developments it 
has learned from the statements of nuclear energy experts, 
especially since officials use the two points of "cost and 
nuclear safety" as an excuse to kill this plan. 
  First, the point concerning the plan's costs; a high-ranking 
nuclear energy official has disclosed to me that financing is 
secured by Law No. 45 of 1975, in accordance with which 
President al-Sadat set up the Alternative Energy Fund in 1975 to 
finance the nuclear power plants project. At the time, the fund 
had $700 million, which has now risen with interest to more than 
$1.3 billion. This fund's revenues are not touched by the 
government because it was set up especially for nuclear plants. 
  The official has said that a number of countries are in the 
process of concluding contracts for nuclear plants, especially 
for the Cando [design] from Canada. These countries include 
South Korea (three plants) and Romania (five plants). Turkey has 
also initiated steps and contacted the Canadians to build a 
power plant, and so has Indonesia, because these plants are 
distinguished by their lower cost and their high degree of 
safety. 
  The official added that the cost of this plant is $1.35 
billion, which will be divided as follows: 

  -  There is an existing plan for the possible manufacture of 
some parts of this plant locally, in cooperation with the 
Canadian Atomic Energy Agency. A number of domestic Egyptian 
firms have been comprehensively surveyed. What this means is 
that we will contribute at least 25 percent in Egyptian pounds. 
  -  The second point is that the Alternative Energy Fund has 
enough 
at present to purchase this plant, whose cost does not have to 
be paid all at once. If we consider the matter, we will find 
that we will have to pay just $160 million annually. This means 
that we will take only $600 million from the Alternative Energy 
Fund and that we will acquire the rest in bank interest. 

  In addition, Egypt has at present programs to transfer 
Canadian technology in this particular area so as to strengthen 
domestic industry. The Nuclear Plants Authority will study anew 
the types of raw materials available and will conduct a survey 
of construction companies that can contribute to building a 
nuclear plant. This program will determine the percentage of 
domestic participation. 
  Nuclear energy esperts surprisingly revealed that Bechtel, a 
U.S. Firm, has applied to the Ministry of Nuclear Energy to 
cooperate with Canada and the Nuclear Plants Authority and that 
it has, according to an expert, received the "go-ahead signal" 
on the grounds that "Egypt is a signatory of the nuclear weapons 
nonproliferation treaty." 
  The second point used is the "nuclear safety" point, 
especially since the Egyptian Government has used the incident 
at Chernobyl--a Russian reactor that did not meet minimal safety 
requirements and where the people in charge of operating the 
reactor made a mistake--as a justification to kill this plan. 
  Dr. Hafiz Hajji, chairman of the Nuclear Plants Authority, 
has said, "High levels of safety have been developed in nuclear 
plants. It is sufficient to know that the Canadian-made Cando is 
distinguished by the fact that the possibility of reactor core 
meltdown is absolutely nonexistent because Cando's cooling 
systems are highly sophisticated, contrary to the PWR 
[pressurized water reactor]. Moreover, this plant's operation is 
computer-controlled and the plant has two independent safety 
systems." 
  Dr. Hajji added, "This safety issue is over. As an example, 
I 
will note in this regard the earthquake that hit Los Angeles 
recently. A report published by an international magazine says 
that nuclear plants are the only plants that were not affected 
by the earthquake and that withstood it and continued to supply 
the state with power, whereas gas and coal-operated plants came 
to a halt. Moreover, the United States, Germany, and France are 
developing safer reactors so as to achieve greater assurance and 
safety. So, there is absolutely no problem." 
  Dr. Hisham Fu'ad, deputy chairman of the Atomic Energy 
Authority, has said, "Experts are in a poor psychological state 
and there is increased fear that specialists in nuclear 
technology will flee to other countries. I don't wish to repeat 
what I have already said about nuclear plants meaning life. They 
supply us with electricity and they involve great technology, in 
which we should absolutely not lag behind. These plants also 
contribute to development in all areas, including agriculture 
and industry, and they are used for sea water desalination." 
  Dr. Fu'ad added regretfully, "At a time when we kill the 
plan 
with our own hands, we find that Israel works systematically; 
that it has future plans; that it uses its reactors for the 
military; and that it is now trying to build a powerful reactor 
for electricity production. We have reiterated this fact again 
and again, but who is listening?" 
  The truth has actually been reiterated again and again. But 
nobody has listened. It is sufficient to restate that, while 
inaugurating a nuclear power plant two weeks ago, China's prime 
minister said, "there will be no recurrence of another Chernobyl 
catastrophe."

<F P=106> [Article by Adel Sa'ad: "War of the Satellite Channels in </F>
the Arab Skies!"] 
  [Text] During the last few months, the undeclared war 
between Arab television channels for control over the satellite 
world has intensified! 
  It started with the transmission of the Egyptian satellite 
channel, and in one year, the number of Arab satellite stations 
reached 14. Their number is expected to reach 28 in the next 
five years 
  Thus the competition has intensified, and the confrontation 
has multiplied in the war that men with neckties and white 
collars and beautiful women announcers are waging directly in 
the air 
  What is this conflict?! Has the map of media leadership in 
the region changed? And what is the role of Egyptian production 
[facilities] and of Egyptian television along with its rich 
archives in this frantic Arab competition for the world of space? 
  First, we must admit that there are no satisfactory answers 
to all these questions. The fact is that this Arab rivalry is a 
collection of puzzles and filled with mystery. 
  On this basis, we will try to get acquainted with this 
subject through meetings with the people responsible for some of 
the satellite channels--Egyptian and Arab--and those in charge 
of television production work, despite their discrepancies. 
<H5>  The Air Wars </H5>
  In mid-October 1994, the trial transmission of ART [Arab 
Radio &amp; Television] television on four seperate channels 
began 
from Rome. An Italian television company had gone broke, so the 
owners of ART television bought it and rented four channels on 
the Arab Arabsat D.I. [expansion not given] satellite at a rate 
of $1 million annually for each channel! The Arabsat D.I. 
satellite carries 13 satellite channels reserved completely for 
renters through Lebanese, Saudi, and Gulf agencies. The first of 
the channels is the Lebanese "Future" channel that began trial 
transmission and then was stopped by the war in Lebanon. Another 
leasee is the "Resources" group that has been getting ready for 
several months to start transmission on four channels. It is 
composed of a group of Saudi businessmen! 
  The top managers of ART television are Shaykh Salih Kamil 
and 
Shaykh Walid Bin Sulman. The management of the four channels is 
distributed as follows: Samia Sadiq is the president of the 
general purpose channel, Mona Gaber is the president of the 
children's channel, Muhammad Yasin (Lebanese) is the president 
of the Arab and foreign films channel, Ali al-Bunud (Saudi) is 
the president of the sports channel as a backup for the 
broadcasts of Salah Zaki, who presented his resignation before 
the start of trial transmissions. There is also Hamdi Quandil, 
the regional representative, who handles the company's relations 
with the international organizations and associations! 
  Hamdi Quandil summarizes the most important characteristics 
of ART television as follows: 
  "Currently, the average daily broadcast is for 15 hours per 
channel, except the children's channel, which is linked to the 
children's schedule because it receives television programs at 
fixed times. Among our future goals is 24-hour transmissions, 
except for the children's channel, which will operate between 12 
and 15 hours a day. 
  There are several companies providing private television 
support for ART channels like the Arab Production Company in 
Cairo. There are also other production centers in Tunis, Jordan, 
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Lebanon. ART television does not 
offer any news programs or news transmissions, especially since 
most of the other Arab and foreign satellite stations are 
already doing it." 
  I asked him why the Arabs go to Europe for satellite 
transmission and why specifically to Italy? 
  [Quandil] We wanted to broadcast ART television from Cairo. 
We submitted actual requests, and we negotiated with the 
Ministry of Communications, but circumstances didn't permit! 
  [Sa'ad] Which circumstances, and what is the reason for the 
lack of agreement? 
  [Quandil] The truth is that the request was not approved, 
and 
I still don't know why! 
  [Sa'ad] There is a charge that ART television overpays its 
business partners, as though it were trying to pull the rug out 
from under the feet of Egyptian television. 
  [Quandil] This is not true, because we benefit from the 
financial regulations of Egyptian television and our rules don't 
permit payments more then 10 percent above the Egyptian 
television [schedule]. 
  [Sa'ad] Why do you believe there is the increased interest 
in 
satellite stations in the Arab region? 
  [Quandil] Arab investors are realizing the importance of 
investing some of this capital in this field! 
  [Sa'ad] What is the rate of return that the Arab investors 
are deriving from these channels? 
  [Quandil] Income is from the advertisements and 
subscriptions. We expect each one of these private channels to 
encrypt its message, just like the news channel CNN. So far no 
Arab channel depends on subscriptions; most financing is from 
advertisements, especially since the volume of advertisements 
and their price go down when subscription charges begin. 
  [Sa'ad] What is the future of these many channels, and can 
the advertisements cover the cost? 
  [Quandil] These channels are like any other project--they 
are 
exposed to profit or loss and in constant need of great economic 
expertise and outstanding experience. Although I am sure that 
some of the Arab satellite channels will go broke, I am also 
sure that many more channels will appear over the next few years! 
  [Sa'ad] Is it correct that there is a war between these 
channels?! 
  [Quandil] Without a doubt. There is sharp competition, and 
survival of the fittest, at least for the private channels. 
Because countries can support their stations to maintain their 
national prestige, because, unlike the private companies, the 
governments do not depend on money alone! 
  There are now 14 satellite channels in the Arab region as 
follows: Egyptian, MBC [Middle East Broadcasting Center], four 
channels of ART, Moroccan, Amman, Tunis, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, 
Kuwait, Qatar--which began trial transmissions one month 
ago--and Jordan. 
  This, in addition to a number of other land-based stations 
that are waiting for the opportunity to break into the satellite 
world. For example, in Lebanon there are 34 [local] television 
stations available, plus the "closed cable" systems that are 
present in a number of Arab countries. The first of these 
countries is Dubai, which operates three television systems: 
land-based, satellite, and closed cable. 
  Note: The Dubai station's broadcasting hours approach the 
hours of television broadcasting on all of the channels of the 
Arab Republic of Egypt, from the first channel through the 
seventh. Dubai has the first channel; the foreign channel; the 
satellite channel; and, on the closed cable system, the 
educational channel and the information channel; and the trial 
stations for sports and films. And, during this past Ramadan, 
Egyptian television entered as a partner into production of the 
"Qays and Laila" series, which Dubai television produced for 
broadcasting on Egyptian television! 
<H5>  Crowding in Space </H5>
  'Amar Al-Lagthi, president of the MBC, thinks there is a 
difference between government and private channels, because the 
government channels have strategic goals, the most important 
being its presence outside the political borders! 
  He adds that the government satellite stations have an 
economic advantage over private television stations becuse the 
state channels have a source of television materials from the 
land-based channels which feed them programs and products. MBC, 
however, needs to do everything because it doesn't have the 
backup stations on the ground. Even marketing these products has 
been a problem. It is assumed that the broadcasting of material 
comes first, but their marketing is hard in countries that have 
seen them by way of the dish, and we are forced to sell at 
reduced prices, except in one instance--that we agree with a 
number of stations to all broadcast the same program at the same 
time, as happened with "The Riddles of Samir Ghanim" last 
Ramadan. 
  'Amar al-Lagthi confirmed that most of these private 
stations 
depend first and foremost on advertising, because private 
stations can only depend on subscriptions if they offer 
different content from other stations. The fact is that all the 
Arab satellite channels have similar content! 
  [Sa'ad] I observed that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia issued a 
decision forbidding the use of the dish, and asked how 
advertisers can agree to pay an advertising price when Saudi 
Arabia doesn't receive it? 
  [al-Lagthi] I believe that Saudi Arabia forbid the dish, but 
it supplied the alternative cable system which permits receiving 
some channels and not others. 
  [Sa'ad] Also, there is an accusation that you are 
contracting 
with the Egyptian television workers for higher sums of money. 
Is this true? 
  [al-Lagthi] We are working with movie producers not 
television staff, and we respect the decisions of Safwat 
al-Sharif, minister of information, that forbid doing business 
with two stations at once. Therefore, we didn't make use of any 
current broadcaster. We decided from the beginning to give the 
opportunity to unknown young people, because broadcasters are a 
part of the personality of the channel and it is not permissible 
for them to appear in multiple stations! 
  I don't deny that our prices are high, for a simple reason: 
We are the private sector. The difference between our prices and 
the television prices is the difference between work in the 
government and work in the private sector. 
  [Sa'ad] Is there a "satellite war" now between the Arabs in 
the area of satellite channels? 
  [al-Lagthi] No. But there is a satellite crunch. That's all. 
Nothing else. The reason being that the volume of television 
production in the Arab world has not risen in spite of the 
additional channels. The channels that will last are those that 
set up television production facilities and studios. MBC plans 
to establish television studios. Egyptian television is still 
the leader in this area. It owns the largest production base in 
the Arab region. I hope all the Arab owners of these channels 
will unite to complete the studios project in the 6 October City 
so they will be exploited to expand the production base, 
increase the labor force, and improve the Arabic media tools, 
because we assume that our goal is the same--to fight off the 
foreign satellite channels and to lure the Arab viewers away 
from them. 
<H5>  Outside the competition </H5>
  Suhayr al-Atribi, president of the Egyptian satellite 
channel, said that there is no decision forbidding doing 
business with the Arab channels, with the exception of the 
broadcast announcers. This is the situation inside Egyptian 
television itself, which forbids an announcer who works on one 
channel from appearing on another! 
  Suhayr al-Atribi sees no danger from these channels for 
Egyptian television because they basically do not compete. And 
in the last opinion polls of the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-ANBA', the 
Egyptian satellite channel was ahead of all the satellite 
channels during 1993! 
  [Sa'ad] The Egyptian satellite station is supposed to be 
supported by Arab advertising in the geographical areas that use 
it. So, does this happen? 
  [al-Atribi] In our new plan Mr. Safwat al-Sharif, minister 
of 
information, promised that the satellite channels would transmit 
to the United States of America and agreement has actually been 
reached. As for advertising, I believe that the entire Arab 
region is competing to advertise [in Egypt]. There is a 
Saudi-American agency that bought the advertising of the 
Egyptian satellite channel. Every Egyptian is entitled to 
advertise with us through the economic production sector. 
Advertising is continually increasing. When I took charge of the 
channel in 1992, advertising was 15 seconds daily. It has now 
risen to 72 minutes daily! 
  [Sa'ad] There are also accusations concerning the quality of 
the satellite channels and the news they offer! 
  [al-Atribi] The news on the satellite channel is not my 
speciality. So far we get the news from the central television 
news [service]. When I took over the channel, Mr. Safwat 
al-Sharif told me I was to be responsible for the programming 
only. As for the news, it will arrive ready made from the 
television news [service]. 
  [Sa'ad] Is this channel to have a different status, and is 
it 
supposed to be provided with a number of correspondents in the 
Arab world to cover real-time news and transmit it immediately? 
  [al-Atribi] This question is above my competence. Generally, 
I try to cover the Arab world by following the meetings and 
activities that occur in Cairo. Also, the [Egyptian] satellite 
channel has begun to show 25 percent of the programs that are 
produced for it on an exclusive basis, because our study 
confirmed that some programs are only of local interest. 
  [Sa'ad] Suhayr al-Atribi, what is the satellite channel's 
policy in light of the prevailing competition, and what is your 
opinion of the decision forbidding the dish in Saudi Arabia? 
  [al-Atribi] I don't think about the competition. We just 
work 
and, thank God, we have what we need and no one can compete with 
us. As for the issue of the dish, I asked and they said that the 
Egyptian satellite channel will not be abolished. Saudi Arabia 
will bring in the cable system and I believe that the Egyptian 
satellite channel will be among the first of the channels that 
will be included in this system. 
  The president of the production sector, Mamduh al-Lagthi, 
said that the decision of Mr. Safwat al-Sharif, minister of 
information, is a basic organizational process. Egypt is rich in 
the expertise of its young people, and it doesn't withhold its 
expertise from any Arab state. Rather, it supports them 
culturally and in production. The decisions aimed at 
guaranteeing the level of wages and protection of our work 
secrets and our television archives from every temptation. Thus, 
the goal is regulation and not forbiddance. 
  He added that Egypt, its production sector, the television 
union, and the Egyptian media are beyond Arab media competition, 
becuse Egypt has organizational and technical capabilities and a 
history and literary wealth unlike anything in the region. We do 
not compete with anyone, but we support the Arab brothers, and 
this is not arrogance or a type of pride. 
  [Sa'ad] [addressing al-Lagthi] But the Arab stations pay 
much 
higher prices than the television production sector? 
  [al-Lagthi] If it were only that... Money isn't everything. 
Believe me, any artist thinks it over carefully when he knows 
that his work will be seen by a wide audience in Egypt. Yes, 
there are material temptations, but there is a very important 
spiritual burden for the artist, and his value is limited here 
in Egypt. His income level in the future will also be limited 
here. His work in Egypt is what will limit his earnings 
elsewhere! 
  [Sa'ad] But is there a fear of a brain drain to these 
television stations? 
  [al-Lagthi] No. This is also not true, as is evidenced by 
the 
fact that we have been working in the production sphere for 34 
years, while these stations were also producing television 
productions. And if you consult the list of names of artistic 
productions that were produced outside of Egypt and stuck in the 
minds of the Arab viewer, you will find them not exceeding two 
or three productions. Muhammad Fadil directed them and Mahfudh 
Abd al-Rahman wrote them, i.e., directors and writers of 
Egyptian television. At the same time, there are names of 
thousands of important dramatic works that Egyptian television 
has produced! 
  [Sa'ad] What is the size of the production of the production 
sector and the broadcasting and television union as compared to 
the production of the Arab satellite channels? 
  [al-Lagthi] I believe it is more than five-fold what all the 
Arab channels produce collectively. 
<H5>  The First Egyptian Satellite </H5>
  Amin Basyuni, president of the broadcasting and television 
union, preferred to speak about the evolution of Egyptian 
television after clarifying that there is no danger to the role 
of the Egyptian satellite channel from competition like the 
following: 
  The Egyptian media is working toward and has its sights on 
the future. Recently, Mr. Safwat al-Sharif prepared a study on 
the project to launch the first Egyptian satellite that would 
provide more media services for culture, education, and 
training. During the next few days, the study of the project 
will be presented to the Council of Ministers. 
  Currently, Egyptian television makes use of the fiber optics 
system for transmission of the broadcasting and television 
service, in addition to microwave links. This helps make the 
picture clearer. And we started their propagation from our 
transmission stations! 
  Egyptian television now uses the digital system. It is the 
most modern television technology. It is what is called overseas 
high definition television. It means programming of receivers 
and transmission stations and recording by a high precision and 
high definition system. It is the most recent international 
experiment in the field of communications. 
  [Sa'ad] Some people think that there is a fear of losing the 
television archives to other satellite channels. 
  [Basyuni] The tapes of the archives come and go by a system 
of regulations, and no television tape can be taken outside of 
the building even if it is empty. The owners of these channels 
can buy what they want from the archive officially through the 
television and broadcasting union and at fixed prices, and there 
is never any business conducted behind closed doors! 
  [Sa'ad] What were the reactions to the decision of Mr. 
Safwat 
al-Sharif, minister of information, to prohibit television staff 
from contracting with other television stations? 
  [Basyuni] First, I want to clarify something important. 
There 
is a difference between duty and cooperation. We do not permit 
anybody to combine two posts at one time. This is an Egyptian 
labor law. Secondly, we have allowed our staff to do business 
with these television stations on the condition that management 
is sure that it doesn't affect the amount of effort given to 
basic television assignments. Anyone who wants to occupy a post 
in one of these television stations can submit a request for 
rotation or resignation. These are the facts of the decisions, 
removed from any conjecture! 
  [Sa'ad] Why are there no systematic arrangements with the 
owners of these channels? 
  [Basyuni] There is actually an existing arrangement through 
the Arab Broadcasting Union whose headquarters is in Tunis and 
which belongs to the Arab League. There is a permanent committee 
of this union that is composed of authorized representatives of 
the Arab information ministries. It presents its reports to the 
Conference of Arab Information Ministers. Thus, there is 
coordination at the highest level. But the problem currently is 
that these committees work for television cooperation between 
the Arab government stations. The private stations need to 
participate in this integral web! 
  For example, the Arab television stations have had 
difficulties for many years in communicating with each other to 
exchange media feeds due to rising media charges. Recently, an 
Arab satellite channel was rented for media exchange between all 
the Arab stations. Every Arab television is to send three 
packets--news, culture, and sports--via this channel which 
receives and retransmits them to any Arab channel requesting 
them--without reciprocity. The permanent committee is 
responsible for the channel's rent, which amounts to 1 
million [Egyptian] pounds annually! 
  There is another side to the picture--the producers' side. 
Ibrahim Abu Dhikri, general secretary of the Arab Distributors 
and Producers Union for television productions made it clear 
that the producers have several reservations concerning the 
nature of business with the satellite channels, such as the 
following: 
  In the past, the land-based stations contracted to buy the 
producers' works. With satellite transmission, the television 
product is transmitted over a wider geographical area. This has 
led to problems with the producers for the following reasons: 
  The producer used to sell a single work to two or three 
countries. With the satellite channels, the producer sells just 
once to a channel that covers all of this area and pays 
approximately the same price as a single country! 
  The producers confirm that [using] the old contracts is 
absurd and that the agreement does not specify this wide 
geographical area. 
  The satellite stations are deriving their authority from 
documents written as contracts for intellectual property. 
  The Arab intellectual property is not used on the satellite 
stations as it is on its foreign counterparts. For example, the 
foreign serial is shown for the first time at full price. The 
second time, at half-price, and its use ends within a specified 
time period. The Arab stations are obligated to do that, but 
they don't work with the Arab intellectual property in this way. 
They buy it once and use it forever! 
  Currently, we are preparing a detailed memorandum on these 
problems to present to the Permanent Committee on Arab Media of 
the Arab League to be raised at the Arab Information Ministers 
conference this coming July in Cairo! 
  The current situation is causing many problems with 
distribution. All of the old schools of marketing have died, and 
another, unknown language has risen. 
  The strange thing is that these situations themselves are 
producing television productions and they know how much they 
cost. If a station can produce a program for $20,000, and can 
buy it ready-made from the producer for $3,000, is that 
reasonable?! 
  What is even stranger is that some of the satellite stations 
strip the distinguishing logo off the satellite channel material 
so that the producer that sold the literary work to the 
land-based station can protest in spite of the fact that the 
intellectual material is broadcast by satellite! 
<H5>  A Last Word </H5>
  These are not the only words that were said on the issue of 
the future of the Arab satellite channels. Perhaps what helps to 
understand these puzzles is this strange succession and 
competition for buying ownership of Egyptian technical products 
and the invasion of the world production! 
  The most recent news of the satellite channels now is that 
last week Shaykh Salih Kamil bought all of Jordan's studios, and 
it is anticipated that he will buy Lebanon's studios also. It is 
expected that these studios will be the site of the sports 
channel belonging to ART television. 
  A number of television producers adjusted their work to 
offer 
quick services to these stations by opening studios of voice, 
makeup and television photography! 
  Mona Jabir, president of ART television's children's channel 
is presently managing the "Gemini" Studios of voice and image. 
They are outfitted with the most modern equipment and material. 
This is in addition to her work as the president of a channel 
for offering facilities for new television! 
  A number of Arab stations have begun to gradually introduce 
the local dialect of their countries through satellite stations! 
  This is the final picture of the competition that is 
occurring in the Arab arena, and the opinion of the officials in 
it. Does it help to solve the puzzles that still intensify the 
mystery of the picture in the sphere of Arab space? That is the 
question!

  [Text] The winner last Ramadan was the Egyptian satellite 
channel. This was confirmed by our study of the Egyptian and 
Arab expatriate community in Paris. The channel succeeded 
throughout the days and evenings of the blessed month of Ramadan 
in regaining the trust of the Egyptian and Arab people. For its 
transmission was well-organized and its programs diversified, 
and it won in its competition with the other Arab channels, 
especially after its "dish" price decreased, and it became 
within everybody's means. 
  The truth is that this evolution that the Egyptian satellite 
channel is currently witnessing, and that everyone recognizes, 
started several months ago, not just in the month of Ramadan. 
This channel was studied from all sides, both transmission and 
programs. They were able to define its problems, and identify 
the reasons for the interruption of transmission or its 
weakness. These efforts began with the visit the minister of 
information, Safwat al-Sharif, took to France recently, and his 
signing of an agreement permitting the transmission of the 
Egyptian satellite channel to some French cities. 
  The odd thing is that the Egyptian satellite channel has 
become--with regard to the Arab and Egyptian expatriates--strong 
competition for the French channels, in the sense that most 
families kept on gravitating towards the Egyptian channel's 
programs, and they don't watch French television. It is to blame 
for the anxiety of some mothers. Ms. Hanan Muhammad Al-Said, 
mother of two children aged ten and six explains: 
  "My children are no longer interested in watching French 
television, just as they have refused to have anything to do 
with the cartoons that children usually love. They remain tied 
all the time to the satellite channel broadcasts. 
  "I don't deny that "our sons" have improved their Arabic and 
especially the Egyptian dialect because of their constant 
following of the satellite channel, but what makes me concerned 
now is that they have stopped following their favorite programs 
on French television." 
  Ms. Hanan confirmed that the Egyptian satellite channel has 
succeeded in attracting all the Egyptians during Ramadan, just 
as it was able to break through the sense of exile. The sad 
atmosphere that was born in our souls and that carries all our 
good memories with it in our souls appears especially on big 
religious occasions like Ramadan. 
<H5>  Breaking Through the Sense of Exile </H5>
  Ms. Kawathir Hassanein--mother of two children and one older 
boy, their ages ranging between five and 15 years, says: 
  "The satellite channel has made us feel that we are living 
in 
Egypt, for we see everything, just as if we were living there. I 
hardly feel that I am living in France except when I go out into 
the street, and I interact with others. 
  "The only problem we have with the cartoons on the satellite 
channel is that their dialogue is in Modern Standard Arabic and 
that makes it hard for my children to follow because they know 
colloquial and not Modern Standard." 
  Dr. Ahmed Gamal (father of two children) believes that the 
satellite channel, with its improved programs has became a 
better tool of awakening and feeding feelings of belonging. For 
Egypt is present in the souls of our sons day and night, and our 
family joins in all the religious and national occasions. There 
is also great passion among the Egyptian expatriates for the 
ball games and their scores. They talk about them all the time 
just as if we were sitting in the popular coffee houses of Cairo. 
  He adds: "As for the most important improvements of the 
satellite channel, they are that it made Egyptian families 
refrain from searching for a special teacher to teach the 
colloquial language to the children, as Egypt made them teach it 
in history books present in front of them during every 
broadcast." 
<H5>  The Distance of the Channel From the Interests of the </H5>
Expatriates 
  But another person, Abd al-Hamid Muhassan, who has lived in 
Paris for 15 years, thinks that what the satellite channel is 
deficient in is its lack of approaching the interests of the 
expatriate Egyptians, for it doesn't offer them through its 
programs enough information relating to the customs laws or talk 
to them about new Egyptian products. 
  He adds: "This information will benefit us greatly because 
it 
will make us avoid some of the problems that confronted us at 
the airport at the time of our visit to Egypt just as it will 
prompt us to buy Egyptian products instead of returning carrying 
gifts from Paris." 
  Abd al-Hamid does not deny that the Egyptian satellite 
channel eliminated his feelings of loneliness because he lives 
alone in Paris while his wife and his children live in Egypt, 
and because he keeps on feeling that he sees what they see and 
he lives in their atmosphere. Likewise, it has become within his 
capability to send them his greetings through articles earmarked 
for receiving the correspondence of expatriates. 
  Another remark that another expatriate, Mr. Uthman (he has 
lived in Paris for 10 years and he is the father of two 
children) cites is this. He says: 
  "We are suffering from a deficiency of information that the 
satellite channel broadcasts especially with what relates to the 
recent occurrences of violence in Upper Egypt. While the 
broadcasts and other means of media are keen on broadcasting 
them, there are many occurrences of exaggeration in them. We 
find ourselves scattered, lost between what we hear from these 
broadcasts, and the condensed news that the satellite channel 
broadcasts. 
  "Likewise, we want it to cover a larger area of local and 
regional news, because most of us want to know what is happening 
in the governorates and the centers in Egypt. For we follow the 
international news on French television, and we are not 
deficient in anything except the regional news that seems 
marginal to some but is in reality of the utmost importance to 
the expatriates." 
  Mr. Uthman offers another observation concerning the program 
"Arabian Evening." He says that it is a splendid program, but 
most of the songs that it offers are resumed more than once in a 
week, and he wonders why Egyptian television does not try to 
broadcast new songs and passages. 
  Finally, the Arab and Egyptian expatriates in Paris agree on 
the distinctness of the programs that the satellite channel 
offers and particularly the program "Words of Gold," the program 
"Very Frank Dialogue," which invited as its guest the first time 
Mr. Ibrahim Nafia', editor-in-chief of Al-Ahram, and a cartoon 
program, in addition to the other series like the series "No," 
which Mustapha Amin wrote, and the series "Arabesque," whose 
starring role was undertaken by the gifted artist Salah 
Al-Saadani. 
  The expatriates are requesting an increase in the space 
designated for cultural programs so that the satellite channel 
is not transformed into merely entertainment. Likewise, some of 
them suggested that the channel undertake the identification of 
the Egyptian and Arab expatriates respectively during the 
conducting of civil investigations that involve the life of the 
expatriates in different countries, then broadcast them.

<F P=106> [Article by Engineer Haydar Kamunah, Baghdad University </F>
Institute of Higher Studies for Urban and Regional Planning: 
"Commercial Streets in Baghdad; Economic Losses in Energy 
Consumption"] 
  [Text] It is well known that energy is one of the most 
important elements of power and that it is a basic support upon 
which the countries of the world rely for progress and 
development. Every country in the world either has faced, or 
will face, an energy crisis in one form or another, and because 
of that, all possibilities must be determined and attempts made 
to avoid--as far as possible--being damaged by that crisis. 
  With respect to consumer countries, if the aspect of that 
crisis is the supply or supplies of energy from abroad, then we, 
as a producing and exporting country, have another aspect of 
that crisis. The latter aspect is represented by the diminished 
price of this energy, its excess production and supply, and the 
drop in consumption, which will result in reducing the life of 
its reserves. Consequently, this natural wealth will dry up in a 
shorter period of time. This is especially true since our 
country is going through extremely critical circumstances, with 
regard to rebuilding the national Iraqi economy during this 
iniquitous blockade imposed upon our valiant nation. 
  The process of air conditioning the buildings located on 
more 
than 200 commercial streets has changed the use of the land of 
those streets from residential, in accordance with the basic 
design agreed upon for the city of Baghdad, to commercial in 
accordance with decisions made by the Municipal Council during 
the last decade. This requires producing additional electrical 
energy, considered to be among those economic sectors that are 
capital intensive. This sector requires high investments as a 
result of the enormous sums of money needed to establish power 
stations, transmission networks and lines, and electrical 
transformers. This gives the allocated investments an active and 
influential role in raising or lowering growth rates with regard 
to the production of electricity. 
  In Iraq, the capital-intensiveness of the electricity sector 
was reflected in consecutive increases in total fixed capital 
formation during the period 1970 to 1990. Through observing 
actual electricity production in Iraq from 1970 to 1990, it 
becomes clear that total fixed capital formation rose from 32.8 
million Iraqi dinars [ID] in 1980, in fixed prices for the year 
1970, to ID155.5 million for 1990. This shows an annual growth 
rate of 8.1 percent for 1970-90. 
  The consumption of electricity fluctuated among the various 
sectors. The domestic household sector consumed 40 percent, 
while the administrative and services sector consumed 41.5 
percent for 1988. These percentages rose in 1989 to 43.5 percent 
for the household sector and 36.6 percent for the administration 
and services sector, while the percentage of consumption for the 
industrial sector, which is the sector that forms the country's 
backbone, was no more than 8.5 percent in 1988 and 7.9 percent 
in 1989. We should note that those percentages are different in 
advanced countries. For example, in Sweden the percentage of 
electricity consumed in the industrial sector in 1985 was 40 
percent of total consumption, and in the transportation sector 
it was 20 percent, while the commercial and residential sector 
consumed 40 percent. In the United States, the residential and 
commercial sector used about 17 percent of total electricity 
consumed in 1985, while industrial sector consumption was no 
more than 23 to 25 percent. The services sector used 35 percent 
of total consumption. 
  Advanced nations try generally to guide their consumption 
and 
concentrate on the industrial sector, considering it the 
influential economic sector with regard to the state's economic 
structure. One should note that the industrial sector's 
consumption rates in these countries are generally close to or 
exceed the residential sector's consumption rates. Reducing the 
volume of consumption for air conditioning, which uses 55 
percent of the electricity consumed per residential unit in 
Baghdad, is very necessary, especially if we consider that this 
consumption goes up to 80 percent from May to October. However, 
it is very unfortunate that changing the environment of these 
streets from residential uses to commercial (multistory 
buildings, with commercial shops on the ground floor and 
residential apartments, offices, and clinics on the other 
floors) has resulted in major economic losses in the consumption 
of electrical energy. This decision was made without regard to, 
or in violation of, one of the design principles that must be 
employed in architecture and urban planning when erecting any 
building in the city. That principle is to protect human beings 
from climatic conditions and provide a suitable environment for 
living, working, and recreation. In order to achieve that, it is 
necessary to provide that building with a group of architectural 
and physical characteristics that make it an appropriate social 
instrument to fulfill its various functions.

<F P=106> [Sajir Zubayr Ja'atah, president of the General Federation </F>
of Peasant Cooperative Societies, interviewed by Dhiyab 
al-Mafraji; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The question remains: how do we increase our 
agricultural production? We multiply the acreage of cultivated 
land. What is required of the peasants, as they are the crucial 
factor in the success of any agricultural plan? While Iraqi 
peasants have their decreed national role, what is the role of 
the General Federation of Peasant Cooperative Societies? Is it a 
merely guiding role, or does it have special executive aspects 
in its serious endeavor to implement agricultural plans in a 
manner suited to our present circumstances, in which we are 
contending with the criminal sanctions? 
  These are the questions AL-'IRAQ posed to Mr. Sajir Zubayr 
Ja'atah, the federation's president. We had a dialogue, with 
responses that may shed light and provide indications that we 
hope may play a broad role in implementation. 
  The president of the federation said, at the outset of our 
interview with him: 
  "Throughout its long career, our federation has had an 
effective and influential role in the production process, in 
propelling the agricultural sector forward. At the present time, 
as a result of the difficult circumstances and the effect of the 
unjust sanctions on the scarcity of agricultural and productive 
necessities, everyone is forced to search for other means and 
alternatives in order for the production process to continue in 
the agricultural sector, without interruption. We are acting to 
increase agricultural production at rates surpassing those of 
past years. I can confirm that our country is capable of food 
self-sufficiency, using the same cultivated areas, if we use 
ideal scientific methods in cultivation. We can raise production 
standards on the basis of increased yield per acreage unit, in 
terms of plants, and per production unit, in terms of livestock. 
The 1994 plan focused on our federation's total action and 
activity by carrying out the tasks entrusted to us and departing 
from traditional formats of work and searching out innovative 
methods, with the instructions of President Commander Saddam 
Husayn, God preserve him, as the guide for our daily work. The 
federation's plan relied upon an emphasis on field 
work--productive work." 
  The president of the federation added that the federation's 
working plan for 1994 is founded upon the following bases: 
  "Reliance upon the sayings and instructions of President 
Commander Saddam Husayn, God preserve him, considering them the 
guide for our labor, and a permanent program for all our rural 
activities, as well as in our political and agricultural work as 
the Peasant Cooperative Societies take up their effective and 
influential role in mobilizing their energies in the political 
and productive fields, and as we make field visits to the 
governorates, hold symposiums with the peasants in their 
workplaces to explain the dimensions of the current phase and 
the economic conditions our combatant country is experiencing, 
the importance of the honorable role of the peasantry in 
confronting threats and all types of agression, and thwarting 
the criminal sanctions." 
<H5>  The Organizational Aspect </H5>
  "From the organizational standpoint, the plan emphasizes the 
development of the local and branch federations and the peasant 
cooperative societies. Each local federation selects one peasant 
cooperative society for each region, and makes it into a model 
society that can be the core of cooperative and advanced action. 
We are working to mobilize the peasantry and get them involved 
in their societies, training qualified and active persons for 
the membership of the administrative boards, and concentrating 
on some societies noted for their growth." 
<H5>  The Production Aspect </H5>
  Turning to the productive (economic) aspect, the president 
of 
the federation says that "our federation's working plan confirms 
our pricing policy, which was set by the leadership, and the 
unlimited support of the President Commander that the 
agricultural sector has enjoyed. That has been one of the most 
important direct means of increasing and developing production, 
and getting into the production process in a practical way. It 
takes into consideration the reality of production and the 
yields realized for various crops, with a study of decreasing 
yields and the search for methods available to boost 
productivity in the agricultural sector, confirming the 
importance of exploiting arable land in a studied and systematic 
way. Part of this is the method of farming and the use of types 
of seeds, fertilization, pest control, and the monitoring of 
yield during the harvest, marketing, and storage phases to 
increase agricultural production on one hand, and to put an end 
to losses and waste on the other. In addition, we work with all 
relevant agencies in the agricultural sector to develop our 
work, offer better services, and supply agricultural needs. 
Steps will be taken and actions taken toward a fair procedure 
for distributing water in the major and branch waterways in 
order to provide the water needed for all cultivated areas, 
especially in the summer season, rationalizing consumption 
through reduced direct outlays; economizing in the use of 
primary materials and resources needed in production; setting up 
a comprehensive plan for field monitoring and supervision of 
actual agricultural work; identifying its problems, finding 
suitable solutions for them, and working together with related 
agricultural companies in the agricultural sector." 
<H5>  Boosting Yields </H5>
  "The General Federation of Peasant Cooperative Societies 
accords this field special importance, and is coordinating with 
research and scientific agencies in the agricultural sector, and 
the universities, to achieve an advanced agricultural state 
based on what is present and available, to boost yields and 
improve them. One of the chief causes of the drop in crop yields 
is the weakness and decline of types of seeds used: the seeds 
currently in use have been used for years without bringing in a 
new strain or type. This has led to the overuse and decline of 
the yield of these types. Thus we must reaffirm the need for the 
agricultural scientific research agencies to invent new types of 
the strains and varieties now in use in the cultivation of 
wheat, barley, rise, and other crops, that will achieve higher 
yields. This is also the case as relates to the invention of 
varieties with a high resistance to salinity. This is a 
dangerous pest that has spread in many regions of the country. 
We will also study the causes of the deterioration of grain 
yields in farming, seeds, the use of fertilizers, irrigation, 
and the effect of other factors on that, such as the rise in 
salinity, agricultural pests, and other things." 
  The president of the federation concluded the interview by 
saying: "There are other matters relating to the plan, related 
to marketing and credit, and making the best use of animal 
resources. The General Federation's plan emphasizes these bases 
in its work and it is up to the relevant offices and local 
federations to undertake the monitoring of detailed plans and 
their details with the aim of having them implemented by the 
relevant office and local federations, in coordination with the 
relevant ministries and offices, each in accordance with its 
jurisdiction."

<F P=106> [Article by Mahir 'Abbas: "Saudi Computer Companies To </F>
Provide Consumers With Inexpensive Genuine Programs"] 
  [Text] A law to protect authors' copyrights and electronic 
rights began to be implemented this month in Saudi Arabia, 
making software piracy and copying illegal acts punishable by 
law. Software manufacturing, production, and distribution 
companies are encouraging this approach. At the same time, they 
are promising the consumer that the law is in his interest and 
that they are about to market a variety of inexpensive, original 
programs that will obviate the need to buy counterfeit software. 
  Now that Saudi Arabia has joined the International Agreement 
on Copyrights amended in Paris in 1971, many economic circles in 
the Kingdom stress that implementation of the copyright law will 
protect intellectual property rights, especially computer 
programs and the works of authors and artists in the Kingdom. 
Spokesmen for companies in the computer and software field said 
that the law's enforcement will have a positive effect on the 
software market and will prevent the piracy that was common in 
the market. Furthermore, implementation will be an incentive for 
companies in the field to increase development of their 
programs. It will give them a good opportunity to innovate, 
whereas previously they wasted energy in attempts to protect 
their programs and monitor the market. Several directors of such 
companies told AL-MAJALLAH that they had devoted more effort and 
money to protecting software than to producing it. This had 
raised costs as well as prices for the consumer. 
  Sources indicated that implementation of the intellectual 
protection ordinance will stop acts of piracy and the gray 
market whose participants until now took advantage of the 
absence of any deterrent to stop them. The result was that 
genuine programs struggled to survive in the market in the face 
of similar copied programs at token prices with which they could 
not compete. 
  In order to investigate views of the software business as 
the 
ordinance to protect intellectual property goes into effect this 
month, AL-MAJALLAH sounded out the computer software market 
through three major companies in the field. 
  According to Faysal Jam'an, general director of 
ISCO-Microsoft Integrated Systems Company: "Implementation of 
the ordinance will undoubtedly give a powerful impetus to 
software companies to devote themselves to more innovations that 
serve the market. They will expand into more new research 
programs than previously. The companies were very concerned in 
the past with monitoring the market and protecting their 
programs. The effect for the consumer came in the form of higher 
prices." 
  He referred to serious efforts by several Saudi banks and 
other companies to prevent dealing in unauthorized software. He 
indicated that this constituted significant cooperation with the 
protection law. 
  Al-Jam'an declared that companies and various agencies would 
try to protect their equipment and networks by seeking genuine 
software, pledging to use it, and conforming to the law. "At 
Microsoft, we have organized an information campaign to coincide 
with implementation. We present the importance of using the 
original program and how to protect one's computers. As previous 
methods of piracy disappear, the market will be revitalized with 
new software. The big companies will embark on more future 
investments to bring out new products." However, Jam'an 
emphasized that implementation by itself will not suffice. 
Cooperation between consumers and companies is needed. The 
advantages of original programs over counterfeit or copied ones 
are indisputable. This cooperation will reduce many of the 
consequences of the time and effort that were devoted to 
monitoring. Al-Jam'an also calls for monitoring the market after 
implementation of the law, to prevent counterfeit software from 
entering. 
  He noted that pirating companies had become skilled at 
copying programs. They had a wealth of technical tricks and used 
the most advanced techniques in the field of counterfeit copying 
of highly advanced programs. 
  With implementation of the new law, the market will be 
protected from such programs, which had a negative effect on the 
market and on companies. 
<H5>  Protecting Investments </H5>
  Hani al-'Alami, director of training at Gulf Star Company, 
said that the matter would delight software companies and give 
them means to protect the investments they had made in programs. 
Previously, the picture was unclear, which enabled anyone to 
copy software from the original without legal prosecution. This 
led to large-scale piracy, which affected the market. 
  Al-'Alami thinks that implementation of the law will give 
the 
software market more orderly buying and selling operations and 
will protect companies that invest in this field. He indicated 
that Gulf Star Company had a program called "Arab Word" that had 
been designed with a special protection system. However, the 
copying companies had overcome the protection and had become 
expert in copying the program, breaking the self-protection 
system on which the company had relied. This had affected sales. 
Gulf Star's original program sold for about 1,000 riyals [R], 
later lowered to R250, while the counterfeit copy sold for only 
R5. The counterfeit spread through the market, while companies 
were unable to prosecute the violators. 
  Al-'Alami cited many examples of methods of piracy in the 
absence of legal deterrent. The company represents various 
software companies, such as the American companies Novell and 
C.A. Novell offered a program valued at $10,000. It was copied 
and counterfeited and sold on the market for only R100. 
Al-'Alami added: "This is certainly piracy and theft of others' 
property and effort. The protection law will eliminate it." 
  Al-'Alami predicts that companies that buy software will be 
forced to buy authorized software and will comply with the law. 
He does not rule out that some companies may be disturbed by the 
law's implementation, but he hopes that dealing in counterfeit 
programs will cease now that there is a law making violators 
accountable. 
  As for market conditions after the new law is implemented, 
he 
predicts that his company's sales on the market will double. 
  Mr. 'Imad al-Dughaythir, general director of al-Dawalij 
Technical Company, thinks the law will have a big effect on the 
software industry, especially in a market like Saudi Arabia, 
which forms about 60 percent of the market for Arabic software. 
The law will help companies grow and invest more in the area of 
software. 
  Al-Dughaythir agrees that companies now spend much time, 
effort, and money on ways to protect their programs--more than 
the costs of production. This has caused many companies to 
shrink from risking further investments. These companies have 
been making great efforts to monitor the market. With the new 
law, they will devote themselves to other activities, and this 
will be reflected in the products offered in the software market. 
  The law will form a protective wall for the companies 
against 
piracy. As a result, they will be able to devote themselves to 
developing their product, instead of monitoring the market. 
Implementation of the law will be an impetus to new investment 
opportunities in the field with equal competition, rather than 
piracy. 
  The development programs of various companies will receive a 
good deal of investment directed toward them. The law will stop 
piracy by putting copied programs out of commercial circulation. 
This will give companies the opportunity to operate in a secure 
market. It will also do away with the so-called gray market. 
<H5>  Viruses </H5>
  Al-Dughaythir thinks that the new law will eliminate or stop 
the spread of viruses. Many copied programs are moved from 
machine to machine and therefore transmit viruses to the 
companies. 
  Regarding the condition of the market, he indicated that the 
consumer will find new programs at low prices around R100 or 
R200. He added that his company has comfortably priced programs 
that have not been put on the market yet because their costly 
copy protection system made the programs uneconomical. The 
company refused to spend enormous sums to protect programs that 
the market might not absorb. 
  Al-Dughaythir also thinks that the software sector will see 
positive movement with the implementation of the law. In the 
past, protection was not up to the level of investment. Now, 
however, the Arabic software market will see many formerly 
absent programs in the coming period. 
  The prevailing impression in the companies was that 
consumers 
in the Arab market look for cheap programs and do not consider 
the effort and money needed to produce them. With the law's 
implementation, al-Dughaythir predicts that the market will 
attract new companies that had stayed out and viewed it as 
unprotected. Now that there is protection, it will be a fertile 
market, and this will affect its condition positively. He 
believes that the new situation will limit prices because of 
abundant production and the presence of competition. 
  [Box, p 54] 
<H5>  Counterfeit Programs: Cheap But Very Harmful </H5>
  Counterfeit software may seem a good deal to the consumer, 
who acquires an unauthorized copy of a program at a low price 
and uses it without noticeable differences between it and 
genuine software. However, software companies in the Saudi 
market draw attention to the following drawbacks of such 
programs of which the consumer may not be aware: 

  -  Counterfeit software is not accompanied by documentation 
and manuals that explain how to use it correctly and benefit 
from it. 
  -  The consumer does not get technical support from the software 
company or information about updates or adaptation to new 
computers. 
  -  Counterfeit software may contain viruses that wreck the 
computer and ruin all its files. 
  -  Counterfeit software threatens the value of producers' 
investments. As a result, they do not risk new investments to 
produce more modern programs and to offer more applications that 
might be subjected to copying. Companies suffer losses that 
impel them to leave the sector. 
  -  Companies are forced to employ security keys and protect 
software against unauthorized copying, thus increasing the cost 
of the software to consumers. 
  -  Using these counterfeit programs 
makes the user subject to punishment by law for every time the 
programs are used.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, by </F>
Fawzi al-Jundi, from Cairo, date not given : "I Want To Give Up 
My Official Responsibilities"--first paragraph is AL-SHARQ 
introduction] 
  [Text] The Arab people, from the Atlantic Ocean to the 
Gulf, are following with mounting unease the deterioration of 
events in Yemen. All are eager for the success of the union, a 
natural thing between the two halves of Yemen, though reckless 
bullets assassinate the hope in the Arabs' hearts. This war has 
no winner and no loser. The loser is the spirit of restoring 
Arab solidarity; the winners are those who seek to extinguish 
the light in this nation, its movemennt toward development, and 
collective action for greater stability here and in the Arabian 
peninsula, the Gulf, and every Arab country, God willing. 
  [al-Jundi] Some observers think the failure of the Salalah 
meeting between you and President 'Ali Salih was due to your 
having proposed that the armed forces take action incompatible 
with Yemeni unity. 
  [al-Bid] That is not true. We never did anything like that. 
But our brothers in the Congress, or some of them, excel at 
playing games, at maneuvering, talking, and misrepresenting 
things. We leave it to you to pursue. We want to formalize the 
document, nothing else. I hope everyone will abide by the 
document on national consensus. 
  [al-Jundi] A prominent commander at the General People's 
Congress has said that the Yemeni union can only be ended by war. 
  [al-Bid] Of course war. Those opening fire are aiming at our 
union. We consider 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's speech of 27 April to 
have opened fire on our unity. Perhaps the rest of the patriots 
are rectifying this situation, because war and partition are two 
sides of the same coin. If there is a motive for that, it is the 
motive to destroy the union, though, God willing, despite all 
our pains, we can survive this. Our people know that today there 
are still breakaway groups from the 3d Brigade in the mountains 
and on the roads. We cannot as yet supply statistics as to who 
is alive and who is not, because they are still monitoring their 
preparations in the 3d Brigade and the mountainous regions north 
of Sanaa. They have their equipment, unfortunately. If the 
action had been against their wishes, it would have been 
possible to have no imminent collapse or pursuits of those who 
lived, but they continued. The strange thing is that after 
leaving the camp, organized preparations were seen in every city 
with tribes--they were stacking barrels and clenching their 
fists. How could this be, if the action was outside their 
control, a big mistake in spite of those exerting all this 
control? There are things time will reveal quite soon. We hope 
to keep those who remain, and that they be destined to live, 
both the 1st Brigade and the 2d. They are all sorely tried, and 
offering their precious blood on land far from home. This is not 
our battle. This is a crime being committed by a small group 
that does not like Yemen, or the Yemeni people, or its union. It 
is secessionists who are behind these deeds. 
  [al-Jundi] What is the role of the committee of political 
dialogue after the militarization of the crisis? 
  [al-Bid] The dialogue committee, outside the coalition, is 
active. I met them on Monday and Salih on Sunday. I wish them 
further efforts and we will all cooperate with their initiative. 
I welcomed it in my meeting with them. 
  [al-Jundi] The Yemeni Presidential Council issued a 
statement 
saying that the Council was legally and constitutionally 
responsible for the protection of the united state in all its 
regions. 
  [al-Bid] The former legitimacy is finished. What is called 
the Presidential Council is a partitionist group, not the 
Presidential Council we recognize in accordance with the 
Constitution. The Presidential Council has, unfortunately, set 
itself up as prosecutor, judge, and jury, and everything else, 
and issued its verdict that the 3d Brigade was the cause before 
the arrival of the committees--before the committees conducted 
their investigations. How could it allow itself to do that? Is 
this the Presidential Council? Is it not our right to admonish 
this conduct, to understand that the people are aware, that they 
know what's going on? This is one of their farces to impose 
secession in the name of unity. This is not pro-union or a 
legitimate action at all; it is a partitionist and isolationist 
action on the part of individuals in the Presidential Council. 
The Yemeni people know this. If they want to preserve the union 
and stability, let them go back to the pledge document and the 
accord. 
  [al-Jundi] Is there any hope that you will go back to work 
in 
Sanaa, the capital of the united Yemeni state? 
  [al-Bid] I hope to give up my official responsibilities, but 
I will remain a combatant with the whole Yemeni people and all 
citizens. As to Sanaa, Aden, or Ta'izz, they are all our cities, 
and I am the one who recently proposed that the document capital 
be Ta'izz; that would be where we work, given that it is in the 
middle, and that most of the government staff is from Ta'izz. At 
this point we are working from this capital, until the document 
is implemented and the situation stabilizes in the two capitals: 
the winter and summer capitals, Sanaa and Aden, in accordance 
with the provisions of the document.

<F P=106> [Article by Rashid Hasan: "National Bank Results; Signs of </F>
New Phase"] 
  [Text] A few days ago, the Saudi National Commercial Bank 
published its general budget report for 1993, accompanied by the 
usual explanatory financial data. This is the first time in 
years that the bank's management has offered such a revealing 
review of its situation and performance in various fields, 
because the general budget for 1991-92 was not published in any 
detail or, at least, did not receive a sufficient amount of 
attention and absorption at that time. In view of the choice and 
scope of publication, attributable to the bank being a private 
noncorporate company, providing financial data in this detail to 
the public is, of itself, the most important indicator of 
changes that have suddenly occurred in the situation of this 
important national institution. After the difficult 
circumstances to which it was subjected in 1991, the National 
Bank weathered the crisis in 1992, and entered into 
unprecedented activity under the circumstances by exposing its 
total performance to market pressures and the scrutiny of 
overseers. This in itself is the most important factor of future 
strength and the biggest incentive for the bank's progress, so 
that it may reclaim its natural position as the kingdom's most 
deep-rooted and strongest bank. 
  Because numbers are just numbers, we are taking this 
occasion 
to publish this report so that its numbers can be quickly read, 
while pointing out the most important aspects that will 
especially interest the ordinary citizen. 
<H5>  Status of Deposits </H5>
  The National Bank is keen on repeatedly making sure that the 
developments to which it was subjected have not affected its 
base of depositors, which clearly has been loyal to the bank. 
This fact is revealed by the stability of clients' deposits of 
nearly 49 billion Saudi riyals [R], which remain virtually 
unchanged from 1992. On the contrary, one could say that 
customer deposits increased "slightly" in 1993. However, this 
increase was not obvious, because the bank's clients kept an 
increasing part of their deposits in government bonds, since 
these bonds had a greater return than interest on deposits and, 
at the same time, had convenient incentives. As an example, the 
volume of customer investments of this type of financial 
instrument increased from R5.7 billion in 1992 to R7 billion in 
1993. 
  However, total deposits in the National Bank were affected 
in 
1992 (in comparison with 1991) because the bank's operations in 
New York and London were halted. The suspension of the bank's 
two international branches resulted in transferring a major part 
of foreign operations to other banks and, consequently, the 
removal of deposits connected with those activities. The New 
York branch alone represented $4 billion which, for the most 
part, were deposits of institutions and banks. Moreover, the 
budget of the London branch ranged between $1.5 billion and $2 
billion. It was no surprise, therefore, that customer deposits 
dropped in 1992 to R48.7 billion from the approximately R65.5 
billion at the end of 1991. However, the largest portion of the 
decrease in this area stemmed from the removal of deposits of 
organizations and groups doing business abroad and not from the 
removal of deposits of individuals and traditional clients. 
  At the same time, the deposits of banks do not represent an 
important source of the National Bank's funds, which has always 
been a net creditor of the Interbank market. This explains the 
lack of important deposits from international banks in the 
National Bank, while the deposits of Saudi banks in 1993 
totalled R5.1 billion. This is a modest figure as a percentage 
of the budget and of the total deposits in the bank. 
  As a result of the drop in total deposits, the size of the 
general budget report declined from R78 billion in 1991 to R63.7 
billion in 1992. The 1993 statement has slightly improved, as it 
has again risen to R66.8 billion, an increase of nearly 5 
percent. 
<H5>  Investments </H5>
  The drop in deposits for 1992, as a result of the decrease 
in 
the bank's foreign operations, was accompanied by a comparable 
drop with regard to assets. The most prominent indicator of that 
was the bank's reduction of its portfolio of deposits with banks 
(which ranged from R24.4 billion in 1991 to R15.8 billion in 
1992). There was also a reduction of the bank's portfolio of 
stocks, bonds, and securities by about R4.4 billion. [sentence 
as published] This is the equivalent of approximately R13 
billion. 
  The National Bank had to liquidate its operations in New 
York 
within a 90-day period, as set forth by American authorities, 
which was by the end of October of that year. This explains why 
the 1992 budget carries the full brunt of the closure of the 
branches. 
  In contrast to that, it should be noted that the bank's 
credit activities in Saudi Arabia remained stable and were 
unaffected by events abroad. The net from loans and credit 
totaled R25.9 billion in 1991 and 25.1 billion in 1992, rising 
to R27.5 billion in 1993. 
  One of the most important developments vis-a-vis the 
National 
Commercial Bank, which is clearly evident in its report, is the 
continual decrease over the past two years in the volume of 
letters of credit and, consequently, the financing of imports. 
These documentary credit activities in the 1993 budget totaled 
R3.6 billion, which is 33 percent less than the 1992 figure 
(which was R5.4 billion) and 40 percent less than 1991, which 
totaled R6 billion. 
  We believe that this aspect is one of the most important 
factors preoccupying the bank's management, because it pertains 
to its traditional share of the commercial money market and 
importing activities by commercial groups and houses and, 
consequently, income from brokerage commissions. This is assumed 
to be an important source of net income. 
  It is probable that the loss of the New York and London 
branches will have an impact on financing trade and imports. 
These activities have also been affected by the position of 
certain international banks (especially in Japan) with regard to 
cooperation in assuming credits. In 1993, they may also have 
been affected by the drop in financing imports by the private 
sector, the guiding of governmental expenditures, and the 
decrease in financing of oil operations because of the drop in 
crude oil prices. However, it is certain that the percentage of 
decrease in documentary credits in the National Bank is higher 
than the rate of decrease in the market, because of other 
reasons that we have mentioned. However, the bank is clearly 
determined to regain its role and its share in this filed, 
within the framework of a comprehensive plan to reestablish its 
presence and operations in the market, especially after the 
major increase in its capital to R6 billion. 
<H5>  Strengthening the Conservative Trend </H5>
  The 1993 statement clearly shows a shift in the bank's 
policy 
regarding currency circulation in future contracts, especially 
in the currency market, because the decline of this item in the 
chapter of regular accounts (i.e., those outside the budget) has 
continued. The total future contracts to buy and sell foreign 
operations was R34.2 billion in 1993, compared with 39.3 billion 
in 1992, and approximately R89 billion in 1991. 
<H5>  Hard Debts </H5>
  The National Bank's 1993 statement contained further 
evidence 
of increased conservatism in evaluating its budget and assets, 
since the total allocation for debt losses was R293.4 million, 
compared with R81 million in 1992, and R470 million in 1991. At 
present, the best evidence for this development is the 
re-addition of major allocations for the decline in value of the 
real estate portfolio, totaling R393.1 million, and other 
allocations for the decline in value of other investments. This 
totaled R170 million, which raises the total allocations for 
1993 to R856.5 million. 
  It is worth pointing out that the real estate allocations 
resulted from the bank's portfolio of real estate obtained as 
part of debt settlements. This portfolio has decreased in value 
as a result of the drop in real estate prices in 1993, and 
because of the possibility that the sale price would be affected 
by the size of the offer, particularly since the bank cannot 
hold on to real estate for more than two years. In any event, 
the belief is that the allocations are larger than what may be 
required. However, they reflect the bank's desire for more 
conservative policies with regard to evaluation of assets. 
<H5>  Restructuring and Operating Costs </H5>
  The 1993 National Commercial Bank Report included evidence 
of 
the stability of the bank's operating expenditures which, in 
that year, totaled R1.432 billion, compared to R1.435 billion in 
1992. Despite the fact that the National Bank has taken actions 
to reduce staff and restructure operations, with the goal of 
increasing efficiency and strengthening management, this process 
did not begin until the latter part of 1993. Consequently, not 
enough time has elapsed for this process' results to be 
reflected in this report. 
  It is expected, therefore, that the bank will clearly show 
stronger developments with regard to guiding expenses during 
1994, especially with regard to salaries. However, the 
possibility of increased reliance on modern technology, and the 
development of other branches for capital investments, means 
that total cost of operations could rise next year, despite 
possible reductions in salaries. 
  One may view the 1993 budget report as the first one of the 
National Bank's new stage of guidance and centralization. 
However, this bank--conservative by nature--will avoid any 
implementation cost, i.e., making a desired change by shock 
methods. As is clearly shown by the bank's performance in 1993, 
this next phase could be called: searching for beneficial ways 
to restore the bank to its natural position. However, it is 
important to implement it now, given the lack of anticipated 
profit from international branches abroad. Here is the 
challenge, because it is difficult to visualize a bank the size 
of the National Bank without international branches. This matter 
will raise a question sooner or later and, in any event, rumors 
are strong in this regard.

<F P=106> [Article by Abhay Vaidya: "Clinton's Step To Repair Ties </F>
With India"] 
  [Text] Washington, April 14--In an effort to repair his 
relations with the Indian community in the United States, the 
U.S. president, Mr Bill Clinton, in a letter to Mr Niranjan 
Shah, a Chicago-based industrialist and trustee of the 
Federation of Associations, has expressed strong support for 
India's economic reforms. 
  He also praised the cooperation between the two countries in 
science and technology, the United Nations' peace-keeping 
operations in Somalia and Cambodia, formulating the 
comprehensive test-ban treaty and the chemical weapons 
convention. 
  Despite differences on some non-proliferation issues, we 
have 
worked together on a comprehensive test-ban treaty and a 
chemical weapons convention," Mr Clinton said in his letter of 
March 29. 
  The tone and content of Mr Clinton's letter is significant 
in 
the light of recent fence-mending efforts by senior U.S. 
officials like the deputy secretary of state, Mr Strobe Talbott, 
and the assistant secretary, Ms Robin Raphel. 
  Significantly, Mr Clinton refrained from making direct 
references to the Kashmir issue. 
  He appreciated the efforts by private Indian organisations 
and the Indian government in addressing important human rights 
issues in the subcontinent, he wrote. 
  "Our concern about human rights are part and parcel of a 
mature relationship between democracies," Mr Clinton said in his 
letter, adding, "We recognise the important work done by Indian 
private groups and individuals and the efforts by the government 
to address human rights problems." 
  "We also encourage India to pursue peaceful solutions to 
problems at home and abroad that have posed threats to the 
security of that great nation," Mr Clinton said. 
  The President assured Mr Shah that the ties between India 
and 
the United States "are solid and that there is great potential 
for further growth and cooperation between us." 
  Mr Shah told TOINS [Times of India News Service] that he was 
concerned about the deterioration in Indo-U.S. relations after a 
series of provocative statements last year by Ms Raphel. 
  In January he and some other prominent Indian-Americans from 
Chicago met Ms Raphel to express their concern over her remarks 
on Kashmir. 
  On February 28, Mr Shah brought Ms Raphel's remarks on 
Kashmir to Mr Clinton attention when he visited Chicago in a 
re-election bid by the Congressman, Mr Dan Rostenkowski. 
  During that meeting, Mr Shah said, the president made some 
positive assurances with regard to the Indian-American community. 
  Interestingly, it was only a few months ago that the White 
House had provoked a strong protest from Indians over Mr 
Clinton's reply to a letter from a Washington-based Kashmiri 
secessionist, Dr Ghulam Nabi Fai. 
  In a December 27 reply to Dr Fai Mr Clinton had said he was 
"looking forward to working with you and others to help bring 
peace to Kashmir." 
  These words had prompted an intense reaction in India and 
among Indians in the United States. 
  After that controversy, the White House appears to have 
restrained itself, seeking to prevent more controversies over 
the U.S. position on the Kashmir issue. 
  This became apparent when Mr Clinton declined to reply to 
the 
Indo-American Kashmir Forum president, Dr Vijay K. Sazawal, who 
had written to the president about the tragic plight of Kashmiri 
Pandits in India. 
  Mr Sazawal's January 7 letter was passed on by the White 
House to the U.S. State Department for a reply. Mr Ron D. 
Lorton, director of the office of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, 
Maldives and Bhutan affairs, despatched a two-para reply saying: 
"I share your concern about the human rights situation in 
Kashmir, including the problems faced by the Kashmir Pandits. I 
hope that peace can soon be restored to this beautiful but 
troubled place."

  [Text] New Delhi, March 23--India today firmly told the 
United States that there could be no discussion on the status of 
Kashmir, while Washington promised to put pressure on Pakistan 
to cease abetting cross-border terrorism and seek a solution to 
the Kashmir issue within the framework of the Shimla accord, 
report agencies. 
  The Union home minister, Mr S.B. Chavan, told the U.S. 
assistant secretary of state, Ms Robin Raphel, that certain 
statements emanating from Washington had "adversely affected the 
situation in J and K [Jammu &amp; Kashmir]." 
  Ms Raphel, whose controversial pronouncements on Kashmir, 
earlier, evoked strong criticism in India, said the "primary 
objective of her visit was to clear up misunderstandings which 
have been created and (she) shared the goal of improving 
Indo-U.S. relations." 
  The home minister also told her that J and K is an integral 
part of India and that the people would not "tolerate attempts 
to undermine the nation's territorial integrity." 
  An external affairs ministry spokesman said Ms Raphel 
expressed her government's appreciation for India's transparency 
and its permission to international human rights organisations 
and diplomats to visit J and K. 
  Ms Raphel, who had questioned Kashmir's accession to India, 
emphasised that "Indo-Pak disagreements over J and K should be 
solved within the framework of the Shimla agreement." 
  Besides meeting Mr Chavan, Ms Raphel held discussions with 
her counterpart in the foreign office, Mr H.S. Puri, the home 
secretary, Mr N.N. Vohra, and some members of the National Human 
Rights Commission (NHRC). 
  Mr Chavan underscored India's renewed offer to Pakistan to 
schedule another round of talks at foreign secretary and other 
levels to underline its objectives of seeking improvement in all 
aspects of Indo-Pak relations, the spokesman said. 
  During her 90-minute meeting with Mr Puri, strains in 
Indo-U.S. relations over contentious issues such as Kashmir, 
human rights and nuclear non-proliferation came up for a close 
scrutiny. 
  "We had a very useful exchange of views as we always do," Ms 
Raphel said as she left South Block for the home ministry for a 
detailed briefing on the situation in Kashmir. 
  She parried a question whether there had been any narrowing 
down of differences between the two sides on these issues. 
  Official sources said both sides touched upon the whole 
gamut 
of the Indo-U.S. relations during the meeting. 
  Her talks here in the foreign office are preparatory to the 
scheduled visit here of the U.S. deputy secretary of state, Mr 
Strobe Talbott, from April 6 to 8. 
  American officials said that Mr Talbott would lay special 
emphasis on winning support in India and Pakistan for the U.S. 
drive to limit the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons. 
  Mr Talbott will also press New Delhi and Islamabad to enter 
into negotiations aimed at resolving the Kashmir issue. 
  During a 30-minute meeting with officials of the NHRC, Ms 
Raphel observed that much importance was attached to the work of 
the commission. 
  She presented a copy of the `Country reports on human rights 
for the year 1993' prepared by the U.S. State Department. 
  Ms Raphel will call on the minister of state for external 
affairs, Mr R.L. Bhatia, and the foreign secretary, Mr K. 
Srinivasan, tomorrow. 
  Ms Raphel met the NHRC member, Mr Virendra Dayal and the 
commission secretary-general, Mr R.V. Pillai, for a first-hand 
knowledge about the functioning of the commission. 
  Mr Dayal informed her of the main areas of the commission's 
work. She was also briefed about the various programmes of 
visits which the commission had undertaken to various states and 
the contacts made with like-minded commissions established by 
other countries.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 24--India today warned the United 
States that any enhancement of Pakistan's offensive military 
capabilities would escalate tensions in the region and seriously 
affect India's security environment. 
  India's strong reservations on the possibility of an 
amendment of the Pressler legislation or its waiver to supply 
more F-16 jet fighters to Pakistan, were conveyed by the foreign 
secretary, Mr Krishnan Srinivasan, to the U.S. 
assistant-secretary of state, Ms Robin Raphel. 
  An external affairs ministry press release said Mr 
Srinivasan 
reiterated India's willingness to resume dialogue with Pakistan 
at the foreign secretary level and hoped Pakistan would eschew 
the path of internationalisation of the Kashmir issue and 
support to trans-border terrorism. 
  Ms Raphel told the foreign secretary that the United States 
was willing to encourage the process to facilitate resolution of 
all outstanding problems between the two countries. It welcomed 
the continuation of the bilateral dialogue between India and 
Pakistan which was resumed in January last. 
  India has reaffirmed its consistent position on, and 
preference for a global, comprehensive and non-discriminatory 
approach to non-proliferation and security-related issues. 
  This was made clear to Ms Raphel by the minister of state 
for external affairs, Mr R.L. Bhatia, when she called on him 
today. 
  India has also expressed its reservations on the possibility 
of discussing the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] and related 
security issues in a multilateral forum comprising some selected 
countries. This point was raised by Ms Raphel during her 
discussions with Mr Srinivasan. 
  Ms Raphel had a series of discussions with Mr Bhatia, Mr 
Srinivasan and also the commerce secretary. She got an 
opportunity to interact with several joint secretaries of 
territorial divisions in the external affairs ministry at a 
working lunch hosted by the jt sec. (America). 
  The foreign secretary regretted the closure by Pakistan of 
its consulate in Bombay and banning the entry of Indian citizens 
through the Wagah checkpost on the border in Punjab. He drew her 
attention to the unanimous resolution passed by Parliament on 
Kashmir recently and asserted that Pakistan's efforts to 
internationalise the issue would not succeed in fulfilling its 
territorial ambitions. 
  Both sides agreed that contentious issues like the amendment 
of the Pressler legislation to facilitate purchase of F-16 
fighter aircraft by Pakistan should be taken up in detail with 
Mr Strobe Talbott, the number two person in the state 
department, who arrives here early next month. 
  During her discussions with the commerce secretary, Mr 
Tesinder Khanna, both sides expressed satisfaction at the 
increased momentum in bilateral trade relations, the growing 
interest of the U.S. business community in commercial 
interaction with India and expressed optimism about the growth 
in trade. 
  Specific issues like difficulties being experienced by 
Indian 
software engineers in securing visas, apprehensions about 
revival of Super 301 and other pressing issues were raised by 
the commerce secretary. 
  Ms Raphel responded that America would use Super 301, 
consistent with GATT and the results of the Uruguay round. 
  The commerce secretary also outlined India's efforts to work 
out a preferential trading arrangement under the aegis of SAARC 
[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]. He expressed 
the hope that Pakistan would join other SAARC members in this 
endeavour. 
  The U.S. commerce secretary, Mr Ron Brown, is also expected 
to pay a visit sometime later this year. 
  Meanwhile, the Janata Dal today registered its strong 
protest 
over the manner in which the Indian government has dealt with 
the visit of Ms Raphel, and wondered why the "nation's dignity" 
had been compromised in such a way. 
  A statement issued here today by the senior Dal MP [member 
of 
Parliament] and former external affairs minister, Mr I.K. 
Gujral, said he was astonished on how all protocol norms had 
been disregarded and the visiting U.S. official received by the 
country's home minister, the minister of state and the home 
secretary. 
  Mr Gujral pointed out that all practioners of diplomacy knew 
that such upgradation of protocol would imply nervousness and 
uncertainty, adding that since the days of Nehru, India had 
evolved a pattern of dealing with such visits particularly in 
similar circumstances. 
  "I fail to understand why the nation's dignity is being 
compromised in such a way. We have both the strength and pride 
to preserve our nation's integrity. We do not need testimonials 
from all and Sundry," Mr Gujral said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Raphel Ruffle"] </F>
  [Text] While the rather coy statements of Ms Robin Raphel, 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, are pleasing to hear, one 
need not be surprised if the tenor of her statements is found to 
be boundary specific. Ms Raphel is expected to proceed to 
Pakistan immediately after her India trip. It will be very 
surprising if Ms Raphel does not once again change track and 
start harping on her favourite theme of human rights abuses in 
Kashmir and question the territorial integrity of India. Should 
this happen, it would be most unfortunate. The inability of the 
world's two largest democracies to see eye to eye has created a 
somewhat anomalous situation. In the economic sphere, India's 
relations with the United States seem to be on a perfectly even 
keel. The commerce department had designated India as one of the 
ten major emerging markets in the world to receive special 
attention as the United States formulates its worldwide export 
strategy. The United States continues to be the largest market 
for India's exports, accounting for 20 percent of what we sell 
abroad. The United States is also the largest foreign investor 
in India with investments in 1993 representing as much as 42 
percent of the over $2 billion approved by the Government of 
India. Apart from these interesting facts, the newly formed 
India Interest Group, reflecting the views of 20 major American 
corporations which include such well-known names as General 
Electric, American Express, AT&amp;T, IBM, Coca Cola and 
Citibank, 
is doing a wonderful job in raising the visibility of U.S.-India 
bilateral relations with policy and decision-makers in 
Washington. As far as the liberalisation policy is concerned, 
the U.S. support seems well defined. 
  But it is the inability of the two countries to strike 
rapport in political matters that has been a cause for concern. 
Strategic alliances here seem thicker than economic 
opportunities. The inability of the foreign-policy-makers in 
Washington to understand the psyche of Indian and Pakistani 
suspicions of each other's intentions which are deeply rooted 
and thus not easily dissipated, and their trigger-happy 
secretaries talking about human rights abuses without 
understanding the ground realities have led to their shooting 
off their mouths, souring not just bilateral relations between 
India and Pakistan, but also among India, Pakistan and the 
United States. Two important reasons as to why India and 
Pakistan are not able to thrash out differences are: Pakistan's 
inability to overcome the fact that it lost Bangladesh because 
of India and so retribution via Kashmir; second, the United 
States' inability to put the sub-continent's priorities over its 
own strategic policies, leading to ambiguous mouthings, 
convenient to boosting its own image and interests. 
Unfortunately, both India and Pakistan have been playing into 
the hands of the United States by each trying to win over the 
super power. If the same will and initiative was shown in 
resolving differences between the two countries, so much more 
would have been achieved and the Raphels of the world would not 
have been ruffling our feathers. It is difficult to accept Ms 
Raphel's statement that the United States is not siding with 
Pakistan over the Kashmir issue and that the Clinton 
administration has no quarrel with the territorial integrity of 
India. If that be the case, Ms Raphel owes India an apology for 
all her utterances. Indian policy-makers have, for once, taken 
the offensive in saying that they do not want to have talks on 
Kashmir. That is how it has got to be. They should also be 
prepared to hear in a short while, Ms Raphel switching to her 
familiar role of India bashing, the moment she leaves our 
shores. The firm stand taken by the External Affairs Ministry 
and the Home Ministry should send definite signals to 
Washington about their misplaced South Asia policy. Also, India 
is fully within its rights not to discuss what is an internal 
matter with a third country. So, lay off Raphel. If, as she 
says, the Clinton administration really wants a strong and 
productive relationship with India, the most important thing to 
do would be for her to save her energies and remain silent. The 
less you talk, the fewer mistakes you commit. That is the moral.

<F P=106> [Article by Raju Santhanam: "A Dose Too Much of Raphel </F>
Rhetoric"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, March 30--The success of Indian diplomacy 
can hardly be measured in terms of how Miss Robin Raphel, the 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, was treated 
during her visit to New Delhi or how a Prime Ministerial trip to 
Washington has been cleared. The truth, however, is that the 
Indian officials, who were given a dose of the Raphel rhetoric 
in private, too, have realized that there is no dilution of her 
views on the Indo-U.S. relations. 
  There are those who say that if Miss Raphel's statements are 
examples of American muscle-flexing, India can hardly complain 
that "pressure" was a new factor. While the Bush Administration 
and some Republic Senators did condemn Pakistan's support to 
terrorists there was no let-up on the pressure from the Bush 
Administration on other pending issues whether it was signing of 
the NPT or the rocket deal with Russia. 
  The difference now is the accent on human rights which is 
being described as a personal goal for the U.S. President, Mr 
Bill Clinton, and it is applicable for all countries. 
  China has been able to withstand pressures of losing out on 
the most-favoured nation status. This is more because of 
pressures from the U.S. business community which is worried 
about a losing market. India has not attracted that kind of 
investment so far. 
  The Americans have a reason to believe that pressure has 
worked on Pakistan. 
  Internally it is being admitted in Pakistan that whatever 
they may say in public both the Nawaz Sharif and the Benazir 
Governments are prepared to give guarantees of "capping" the 
nuclear programme. That America expects India to follow suit is 
obvious. 
  Mandarins in South Block, at least those having a wrong 
notion of how to keep the "flag flying," have tended to react 
more to statements in public but have on the other hand kept 
quiet during private discussions where the "squeeze" is put on. 
  The growing impression in the United States, according to 
observers, is that India is keeping its domestic compulsions in 
mind a factor that has been overstressed in talks with the U.S. 
officials. At the same time the United States is gaining the 
impression that the "pressure" is working. An evidence of it is 
India agreeing to bilateral talks with Pakistan on the Kashmir 
issue. 
  While one official cannot make or mar the relationship 
between the two countries Miss Raphel is being singled out for 
special mention because she is the only U.S. official publicly 
stating the U.S. policy as it stands today and being well 
qualified to do so. 
  But even Miss Raphel and others concerned with the South 
Asian affairs would have been impressed by the way India was 
making sure that Miss Raphel was not "slighted" during her brief 
tour. 
  If Miss Raphel has left with the impression that the Rao 
Government was more than eager to extend a warm welcome there is 
a good reason for it. 
  It was the Prime Minister's Office which was arranging 
various meetings. Meetings with senior officials in charge of 
anti-insurgency operations in Kashmir and Punjab; with Mr S.B. 
Chavan and Mr Rajesh Pilot, besides the Foreign Secretary and 
the Joint Secretary were those that were officially arranged. 
  The suggestion that Washington was not averse to a Rao visit 
appears to have been timed during Miss Raphel's visit. One view 
is that the timing of the offer is the State Department's way of 
showing that Miss Raphel does have the clout despite her 
"junior" status. The implied message: She is not a loose cannon. 
  Several weeks ago after an exchange of rhetoric, it was 
being 
speculated that Mr Narasimha Rao would not be able to visit the 
United States. Now his visit is a virtual certainty although it 
is not expected to initiate any change in the U.S. position. In 
fact the invitation itself suggests further discussions on the 
NPT.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Talbott Visit"] </F>
  [Text] Little or nothing has changed in the relations 
between India and America as a result of the visit by the U.S. 
deputy secretary of state, Mr Strobe Talbott. Both sides seem to 
have gone through a routine exchange of their respective 
positions without conceding any ground. While Mr Talbott 
reiterated the Clinton administration's view that the supply of 
military equipment, including F-16 fighters, will assist the 
verifiable capping of the production of highly-enriched uranium 
for making nuclear weapons in Pakistan, India has refused to 
endorse the deal and expressed concern over the move to supply 
the weaponry. Given the history of distrust between India and 
Pakistan and, for the matter, between India and the United 
States it was difficult for India to accept what it sees as a 
step that will boost Pakistan's military strength at a time when 
the latter is in a particularly belligerent mood. The American 
side argues, perhaps somewhat tendentiously, that the supply of 
military equipment will not affect the India-Pakistan military 
balance, but New Delhi obviously thinks otherwise. Indian and 
Pakistani forces are currently evenly matched if there is a 
short, sharp conflict. But the addition of 38 fourth generation 
fighters along with 3C Orion maritime reconnaissance and strike 
aircraft is liable to tilt the balance against India. 
  Contrary to expectations, the American visitor did not bring 
any package of "suggestions" on the nuclear non-proliferation 
issue for India. This may have been due to the awareness that 
the issue just does not fit into the U.S.-Pakistan matrix and 
requires to be addressed separately. It is possible that 
Washington may have decided that the complex South Asian scene 
has to be untangled gradually and has decided to devote the 
first part of its efforts to Pakistan. It has to be remembered 
in this context that it was American forbearance that resulted 
in Islamabad not only acquiring the bomb but also the delivery 
systems in the form of the first batch of F-16s. In any case 
there are far too many imponderables relating to Washington's 
new initiative in South Asia, the attitudes of Pakistan and 
China being the most obvious, to come to any immediate 
conclusion about future prospects. Mr Talbott cannot but be 
aware that in its first year, the Clinton administration had not 
only ignored South Asia, but through statements of the President 
and some of his officials unnecessarily soured the relationship 
between New Delhi and Washington to an extent not seen recently. 
Insofar as it sought to make amends, the visit was useful, as 
were the nuances suggesting that America might be willing to 
deal with India as India, and not as a function of its 
relationship with Pakistan. But he should not be surprised if he 
detected a note of scepticism in Indian responses.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikhil Chakarvarty: "America's Intentions in </F>
South Asia"] 
  [Text] The United States of America has a large battalion 
of thinkers that has access to an extensive pool of information. 
It is believed that this large battalion of thinkers help form 
public opinion and government policies. However, what do we 
learn when the question of actual implementation of these ideas 
arises? We learn that the Clinton administration, despite the 
presence of this large think tank, is showing a surprising lack 
of maturity in its policies dealing with the world. It rarely 
got any praise for its action in Somalia and its reputation was 
not enhanced in Bosnia. Improper action in North Korea also 
deprived it from any possible glory. As for its policy on China, 
it has not demonstrated any tendency towards an encouraging or 
authentic policy. Similarly, the Clinton administration has not 
earned any respect in dealing with Japan over their ugly and 
improper trade war. The fall of Mr. Hosokawa's from his position 
as prime minister has not helped Mr. Clinton's policy on Japan, 
that is if a policy does exist. 
  Against this dubious background, Deputy Secretary Strobe 
Talbott's recent visit to India and Pakistan was a simple 
exercise and did not hint about any new outlook on South Asia. 
Even if we grant that he was more careful and conventional 
compared to his emotional assistant, his trip has not show any 
new direction. We can say that Strobe Talbott came here and saw 
everything, however, unlike Julius Caesar, he did not conquer. 
  In New Delhi, putting a brave front, he tried to assure us 
that "Washington wants to improve relations with India for 
better relations, and wants to do the same with Pakistan." In 
other words, New Delhi should not worry about what Washington is 
doing with Islamabad. It also means that India has nothing to do 
with or worry about what the United States is giving or not 
giving to Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan should also consider any 
agreement or dealings between India and the United States as 
unimportant. This issue should be considered a bilateral issue 
by both countries. This argument appears to be good on paper, 
however, in reality it is oversimplification of the issue. When 
the United States and Pakistan signed an agreement in the 50s, 
Jawaharlal Nehru had opposed it and told President Eisenhower 
that the dangers of Cold War were being brought to this region 
by this treaty. The U.S. argument was that this would help 
Pakistan fight the communist power. The hint was that Pakistan 
had to deal with the Soviet Union, and not with its neighbor 
India. Krishna Menon had expressed his memorable reaction to 
this U.S. action. He had said that he had never faced a gun that 
can be fired only in one direction. He had also said that supply 
of arms to Pakistan was a cause of concern for India. The fact 
is that even after the end of the Cold War, Pakistan's strategic 
importance to the Pentagon's future plan has not diminished in 
the context of Central Asia and the Persian Gulf. The United 
States needs a place to set its foot in the vast area between 
Xinkiang and Iran. It needs a credible reason also, which only 
Pakistan can provide. Washington also believes that only the 
military can provide both stability and reliability in Pakistan. 
The latest offer to modernize its Air Force and provide it F-16s 
and other military equipment help meet this dual goal. United 
States' most trusted and stable group in Pakistan can be kept 
happy and a very important watchtower to protect the U.S. 
interests in this crucial region will be strengthened. 
  During Talbott's talks in New Delhi, it was felt in the 
capital that the maneuver of getting Pakistan's agreement to cap 
its nuclear program in exchange for providing it F-16s will not 
be successful because no Pakistani government will be ready to 
give up its nuclear program. Still, after the talks in Pakistan, 
which Talbott called fully successful,' it appears that the 
Clinton administration is very eager to provide F-16s and other 
lethal weapons to Pakistan immediately. Efforts are being made 
in the U.S. Congress to suspend the Pressler amendment in order 
to supply these. The fact is that the main pressure on the 
Clinton administration is to ensure the sale of the productions 
of the huge U.S. airplane and missile industry. Senator Pressler 
has already unmasked this fact, especially in the context of 
supplying F-16s to Pakistan. Should Narasimha Rao desire, as 
some of his advisors would want, President Clinton can also 
provide India with a batch of those fighter planes or send other 
kinds of planes to India. In this context, we should not forget 
that the noise made over the cryogenic engine deal with Russia 
and forcing it to back out of the contract, was all done to help 
boost the sale of American rocket manufacturers. India is being 
pressured to give up its missile program for this same reason. 
The U.S. weapon industry that President Clinton wants to 
encourage and advance has this inherent reasoning, "If you need 
rockets or missiles, we are ready to sell you our products. Why 
are you making rockets and missiles?" 
  Now the question naturally arises: What is the reason for 
publicizing these efforts to halt Pakistan's nuclear program? 
Talbott had made it clear in New Delhi that the deal with 
Pakistan should be seen as a deal which has some strict and 
clear conditions. This condition is Pakistan's clear agreement 
to halt its nuclear program before the F-16s are supplied to it. 
He clarified this idea further two days later in Islamabad. In a 
very carefully expressed criticism he had made it clear that 
agreement to initiate U.S. proposals has been made. He also said 
that the goal of joint efforts was to expand on that 
understanding.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Worthless 301"] </F>
  [Text] There are many reasons for the two-month extension 
given to India on Special-301, the U.S. "commercial sword." One 
reason perhaps is Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's proposed visit 
to Washington. At a time when a topic like the NPT 
[Nonproliferation Treaty] is to be discussed in Washington, 
raising the Special-301 issue would be creating unnecessary 
bitterness from diplomatic standpoint. There already are 
differences over several issues between India and the United 
States. More serious that trade issues are the political and 
defense issues. President Clinton and Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao will discuss all these issues. Therefore, we do not 
understand why the U.S. Department of Commerce showed the 
Special-301 sword. Granted, the two month extension is over now; 
however, the official report on GATT talks has been confirmed 
during this time. India has signed it. GATT contains answers to 
all the questions that had led to the Special-301 proposal in 
the U.S. Congress. The U.S. Government should be satisfied with 
India's agreement on the Dunkel proposals of the GATT and should 
work on ending Special-301. Instead, it has warned that India 
will be brought back under Special-301. 
  It appears that India is facing Special-301 because of 
China. 
They want to make China a GATT member. It has applied for it. 
China has made the delay in decision on its entry an issue for 
opposing it. Until China joins GATT, the United States will 
continue to threaten it over copyright and patent infringement. 
China and India are in the same category on the U.S. list. That 
is why India is repeatedly warned about Special-301. It is 
possible that the U.S. Congress does not want to end Special-301 
because of China. At present, China, Argentina, and India are 
the Special-301 countries. India and Argentina have signed the 
GATT documents and both have to change their patent and 
copyright laws under this agreement. Enough time has been 
allocated under GATT for it. The United States is putting 
psychological pressure for making new laws by giving warnings 
every two months. Nothing will happen if India ignores these. 
India should not worry about Special-301 now. How can we accept 
U.S. highhandedness after signing a multi-party international 
trade agreement? All patent and copyright issues are considered 
in the new trade agreement. At a time when multiparty trade 
arrangements are being made, how can the United States become an 
enforcer in a bilateral arrangement? Perhaps, the U.S. 
administration has understood it and has not taken any action 
and India has not wasted time in expressing its 
reaction.

<F P=106> [Punam I. Kaushish: "The U.S. Proposal Is Against India's </F>
Interest and in Favor of Pakistan"] 
  [Text] Do you remember an incident related to Kennedy? 
During his talks with President Chiari of Panama, he turned to 
one of his assistants and said, "I am not managing this 
negotiation very well." The assistant asked, "What makes you 
think that?" Kennedy responded, "He says that we had committed 
atrocities on them in the past, and I agree with him." 
  The time has changed from Kennedy to Clinton and the 
situation has changed from Panama Canal to India. The United 
States has traveled far. However, the president's talks are the 
same. Except that Bill Clinton will not admit that the United 
States has been nasty to India. Robin Raphel will never admit 
that the United States favors Pakistan. Strobe Talbott cannot 
deny that the relationship between India and the United States 
has soured. Winter goes and summer comes, however, from the 
deputy state secretary to the President, everyone curses India 
with full ardor be it the issue of human rights violations or 
Sikhs rights or the Kashmir issue. 
  We hope from Talbott's recent visit to India a new chapter 
will be added to India-United States relations. He did try to 
soothe India over Kashmir and human rights. He spent most of his 
time explaining the Clinton government's South Asia policy. It 
emphasizes nuclear non-proliferation and tells how the nuclear 
capability of India and Pakistan can be controlled. He talked 
about making South Asia nuclear free and kept India and Pakistan 
talking about non-proliferation while discussing the interests 
of a platform of nine countries including the United States, 
England, France, Russia, China, Japan, Germany, India, and 
Pakistan. 
  This sends out a clear message. The United States wants to 
remain the only superpower in the world. It wants to pressure 
India to terminate its nuclear and missiles programs. Washington 
understands that India will not bow down under U.S. pressure. 
Thus, it will adopt a policy that serves U.S. interests. 
  There are two aspects of this plan. First, Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao has received an invitation from President Clinton 
to visit the United States next month. The letter goes like 
this: "I am waiting to meet you. At that time, we will analyze 
world relations as well as our mutual relations. The purpose of 
this is improve U.S.-India relations." One veteran leader 
commented on it in these words, "This letter does not stand 
anywhere when compared to President Reagan's warm letter to 
Rajiv Gandhi." 
  Second, Talbott met with all leaders one by one. Mr. Rao 
expressed India's concern over U.S. plans to supply F-16s to 
Pakistan. However, Talbott's assurance was very restricted. He 
said that he did not want to play the Pakistan card. In 
addition, he criticized Dulles. 
  The hint about Kashmir was also very unclear. Robin Raphel 
declares Kashmir to be a disputed region, but Talbott talks 
about the Shimla agreement. The truth is the Washington is still 
kicking the Kashmir issue around. One Indian observer commented 
that the U.S. proposal is analogous to saying [in wrestling], "I 
have pinned down and I am also pinned down." We should restrict 
our program and Pakistan will get F-16s. This is not 
negotiation; this is a joke. 
  In addition, Talbott expressed confidence about his trip to 
Pakistan. This means that Washington and Islamabad have agreed 
on some confidential pact. The special condition of this could 
be that Pakistan has agreed to restrict its nuclear program. It 
should be remembered here that the commander in chief of 
Pakistani armed forces was purchasing weapons in the United 
States during those days. All Talbott said was, "The United 
States and Pakistan have laid the foundation stone for 
progressing in the right direction." 
  One Pakistani spokesman said that their government will 
consider any proposal that helps balance power between India and 
Pakistan. However, these special issues can be different. This 
way, Talbott has been successful in his lump deal. This means 
that Pakistan will restrict its nuclear program in exchange for 
receiving F-16 fighter planes. This will lead to U.S. pressure 
on India to restrict its high technology, space, and nuclear 
programs. Talbott denies that he is tying Kashmir to nuclear 
non-proliferation. It is incorrect. As for Pakistan, it has 
always viewed this issue within the framework of Kashmir and has 
tied relationship with India to it. The United States knows that 
it cannot change Pakistan's determination. It proposed the idea 
of India and Pakistan forming a regional group to resolve their 
problems. At the same time, they should limit their nuclear 
weapons. 
  Still, it was clear to India. That is why Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao had told Talbott that India will not sign the NPT 
[Nonproliferation Treaty]. It will not express its reaction to 
U.S. supplying weapons to Pakistan because it is actively 
helping the terrorists. Ambassador Siddartha Shankar Ray 
commented, "How can it be logical for the United States to 
increase India's defense-related worries and then pressure India 
to reduce its defense forces?" 
  If there are so many disagreements between India and the 
United States, why was not the non-proliferation issue given 
much importance during Talbott's visit? If we look at it from 
the U.S. perspective, we will learn that Talbott's goal was to 
first target the nuclear weapons and then end the nuclear 
program. We can say that this task is the most complicated after 
the end of the Cold War. 
  The U.S. foreign policy can be viewed from U.S. economic 
prosperity angle. Asia is the only path to its future 
prosperity. Unfortunately, Clinton strategy is to "gain a lot 
without much work" and all this without facing any danger. The 
Asian leaders are opposing it because they find that bringing 
Washington's trade here means Washington forcing its political 
wishes on them. 
  There are two basic aspects of Clinton's Asia policy. First, 
on 3 June he has to decide whether to keep the most favored 
nation clause for China or not. Second is to implement the U.S. 
law Super-301, which empowers the U.S. President to impose 
restrictions on the nations that close their markets to U.S. 
products. The target this time is Japan. 
  In other words, the U.S. administration has become alert. It 
does not want to see another failure in the Indian 
sub-continent. That is why it wants to impose limited 
restrictions and not fight the whole war at once. It is 
targeting India and Pakistan in this context. 
  It is adamant on the proposal related to nuclear 
non-proliferation and weapons control on multi-national 
agreement. He has recently increased the number of nations from 
five to nine, because the idea of five nations was not 
acceptable and it did not satisfy India. Therefore, it has been 
suggested in the U.S. proposals that initial talks be held once 
of twice a year on one issue and these talks can be started by 
either the United States or Japan. 
  The defense in South Asia should be made the basic issue for 
these talks. Each point should be discussed to attain the goal. 
The U.S. proposal emphasizes raising the defense issues in South 
Asia in these talks and pointing out the points of dissention 
that cause these problems. There are provisions to impose 
restrictions on the production of nuclear weapons. This task 
will be taken care of by other associated nations. 
  It will be a good thing if the two countries agree on an 
issue. This platform will monitor to see the rate of progress. 
The basis for any decision is that all involved nations agree. 
  This agenda shows that the U.S. intentions are not 
honorable. 
India will oppose any step that is against it. Of course, Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao will discuss all these issues with 
President Bill Clinton in Washington next month. The United 
States definitely is very important for India, however, the fact 
is that the United States is not always correct; other countries 
are always wrong! 
  Therefore, New Delhi must be fully prepared and the Rajiv 
Gandhi formula about NPT must be made clear once again. It said 
that it must be accepted by all the nations and all must agree 
to gradually get rid of their nuclear weapons by 2010. The U.S. 
proposal that is in front of us is according to the U.S. and 
Pakistani wishes; not to India's. The United States should deal 
with India carefully. India can do a lot for the United States, 
but the United States should also bend a little and try to 
understand facts. Let us hope that Narasimha Rao during his trip 
will be able to convince Clinton to follow Kennedy's footsteps 
when dealing with India.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 20--The imminent induction of 71 
frontline and nuclear-capable F-16 fighters by Pakistan, loaded 
with a variety of electronic countermeasures, poses a threat to 
India's security and will tilt the air strike power in 
Islamabad's favour, defence analysts say, reports PTI. 
  At a time when the Indian Air Force is facing a serious 
resource crunch with no major expansion plans in the offing, the 
induction of fighters of such magnitude by Pakistan, which has 
admitted that it had acquired a "certain capability" in the 
nuclear field, would force the Indian defence planners to 
re-think its defence policy, they said. 
  Apart from the F-16 fighter, another threat to India may 
come 
in the form of at least three U.S.-made P3C Orion maritime 
surveillance aircraft which are capable of attacking India's 
maritime and sea coast assets. These aircraft, built and kept in 
hangars in the United States, could also be delivered to 
Pakistan using the same loophole in the Pressler Amendment, 
analysts say. 
  Even though the IAF [Indian Air Force] can boast of being a 
top class Air Force in the world, with over 700 combat aircraft 
and a well-trained force, the fact remains that over 50 percent 
of its aircraft of Russian origin are in a "bad shape" and 
requires urgent overhauling upgradation and replacement, 
analysts at the IDSA [Institute of Defense Studies and Analysis] 
said. 
  If the U.S. Government goes ahead with the deal, India has 
no 
other option but to go shopping for fighters to correct the 
"asymmetry," the analysts say. However, they said India had only 
limited options on this front. 
  While the cost of frontliner fighters has shot up, the 
United 
States may put pressure on countries like Russia, France and the 
U.K. which are willing to sell fighters to India, they felt. 
Further, the disintegration of the Soviet Union has left India 
in deep trouble for the spares of the existing Soviet origin 
fighter plane. 
  The analysts at the IDSA said the addition of 71 warplanes 
to 
Pakistan would mean that it would have 108 F-16A/B aircraft, 
with a range of nearly 1,400 km. This would tilt the balance in 
Pakistan's favour since India had only about 45 Mirage-2000 
fighters, which can match the capability of the U.S. fighter. 
  Another point to be noted here was the availability of AWACS 
[Airborne Warning and Control System], a force multiplier to 
Pakistan from Saudi Arabia, a close ally, in case of a conflict. 
The total effect of a combination of F-16s and AWACS would be 
"deadly," they said. 
  However, the reported statement of the Prime Minister, who 
said that any U.S. attempt to modify the Pressler Amendment to 
renew aid to Pakistan would "force India to reassess its defence 
policy," was a welcome sign, they said.

<F P=106> [Article by Manoj Joshi: "Offering Carrots or Using the </F>
Stick?"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, March 29--How much of a role has the 
invitation to the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, to 
visit the United States played in unrolling the red carpet for 
Ms Robin Raphel? It is now clear that the Prime Minister's 
office (PMO) over-rode caution and the home minister, Mr S.B. 
Chavan's reluctance to ensure that the visitor was treated with 
due deference. 
  Since the invitation was conveyed to the PMO more than a 
week 
before the arrival of the U.S. assistant secretary of state for 
South Asia, it can be inferred that it did play a role. It is no 
secret that Mr Rao has been most keen to visit the United States 
and his office has been working hard to ensure that his visit is 
a success. 
  However, given its position as the nodal body which 
co-ordinates government policy between various ministries, it 
may be that the PMO has allowed its bias to cloud its judgment. 
Perhaps, signals emanating from this office, reflecting the 
desire for the Prime Minister's success in the United States, 
has given the wrong impression--that India would be willing to 
compromise key elements of its national policies for the purpose. 
  That the Clinton administration may have indeed sensed an 
opportunity in this also squares with the fact that the 
invitation to Mr Rao and the decision of the deputy secretary of 
state, Mr Strobe Talbott, to visit New Delhi was taken around 
the same time. 
  The problem the PMO, and indeed the government, now faces is 
whether or not to accept this invitation or seek dates later in 
the year. They are aware that the Prime Minister's visit to the 
United States must stand up to the already high level set by the 
recent U.K. tour, described by Mr Rao as the "most successful" 
of his foreign visits as Prime Minister. 
  Unfortunately, the government is now confronted with a 
situation where, even as Mr Rao is being received with honours 
at the White House lawns, 38 F-16s fighter jets, hitherto 
embargoed by the Pressler amendment, may begin landing in 
Pakistan. 
  Dealing with this is giving the government a major headache, 
because no matter how it looks at the issue, there are nothing 
but negative consequences for India. The United States has 
promised unspecified "incentives" for gaining India's acceptance 
of this deal, but as of now there is nothing that the United 
States has to offer. 
  The more ominous possibility is that the United States may 
proffer some disincentives instead, should India appear 
difficult. In short, the United States may threaten India with 
the internationalisation of the Kashmir dispute through the 
United Nations, if it does not play ball on its nuclear 
non-proliferation plans. 
  The main reason for the success of Mr Rao's visit to Britain 
was that country has more or less given up even the pretence of 
being a world power and, viewing the world from a commercial 
point of view, decided that making up to India is more important 
than making a point on human rights or Pakistan. 
  So the English have gone out of their way to woo India and 
have made it possible to take the relationship onto what appears 
to be a new plane. 
  This is not the case with the United States, which wishes to 
be the world policeman and arbiter. 
  While U.S. investors are willing to see India in a new 
light, 
and indeed explore the new dimensions of the relationship, the 
U.S. Government persists in looking at India in a somewhat 
old-fashioned way, as a function of its relationship with 
Pakistan, or of its concern for retaining its global hegemony.

<F P=106> [Article by M.D. Nalapat: "Debate Over Prime Minister's U.S. </F>
Trip"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, April 12--During the past month, there 
has been a difference of opinion between the "pragmatists" and 
the "nationalists" over whether the Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha 
Rao, should or should not visit the United States at this 
juncture in Indo-U.S. relations. 
  The pragmatists point to the U.S. emergence as India's 
largest trading partner, foreign investor and supplier of 
technology while pressing for an early visit. The "nationalists" 
point to the Pakistan tilt, and now to the F-16s, as reasons why 
Mr Rao should stay at home. 
  According to members of the Prime Minister's official 
family, 
the Prime Minister has plumped for the "pragmatic" line, though 
the exact dates for the trip have "yet to be finalised." In an 
earlier invitation--to which no reply was sent from the Indian 
side--the U.S. president, Mr Bill Clinton, had suggested May 6 
as a convenient date. A second invitation, brought by the U.S. 
deputy secretary of state, Mr Strobe Talbott, did not specify a 
date. It is this second invitation that has been accepted by Mr 
Rao. 
  The 7 Race Course Road is of the view that the Talbott visit 
"significantly succeeded" in removing the bad taste of the 
earlier remarks of the U.S. assistant secretary of state for 
South Asia, Ms Robin Raphel. 
  During his visit, Mr Talbott did not "press India to make 
concessions on Kashmir," and instead made it clear that the 
United States had no prescription to offer; it was for India and 
Pakistan to resolve their differences by themselves. This stand 
has gone down well with the Prime Minister, as also the explicit 
delinking by Mr Talbott of India and Pakistan on the nuclear 
issue. This is in contrast to the Pakistani stand of linking its 
nuclear policy to India's capabilities. 
  It was considered significant that not just in Delhi, but in 
Islamabad as well, Mr Talbott did not make any statement 
"embarrassing to India." This reticence--in contrast to his 
junior colleague--helped create an atmosphere for acceptance of 
the invitation. 
  According to members of the Prime Minister's official 
family, 
one of the primary objectives of the visit will be to attempt to 
"deter the United States from escalating the arms race in South 
Asia through supply of F-16s to Pakistan. Indeed, this one 
objective by itself makes the trip necessary." 
  During the visit, Mr Rao is expected to lobby against the 
supply of the aircraft not just with the U.S. President but also 
with other members of the U.S. power elite: members of the U.S. 
Congress, academicians in leading think-tanks, and 
representatives of the American media. 
  Mr Rao is expected to make clear that the supply of F-16s 
under pressure from the Lockheed Corporation would lead to an 
immediate response from India, in the form of purchase of fresh 
high-performance aircraft and the deployment of additional 
missile batteries for defense. The PMO [Prime Minister's 
Offixce] is convinced that there will be few takers for the U.S. 
administration line that the F-16s are "almost some kind of toy, 
rather than efficient nuclear weapons carriers." 
  According to the PMO, the decision to go to Washington was, 
apart from the need to pursue every avenue to block the F-16 
deal, taken because of three factors: 

  -  As a signal to the emerging pro-India lobby among U.S. 
business houses that India too is serious about better relations 
with the world's largest economic power, and to establish direct 
contacts with the million-strong Indian community in that 
country. 
  -  To further the process of contacts between various 
levels of U.S. and Indian officialdom. At present, numerous 
contacts are taking place at all levels between India and the 
United States. This process will gain speed after a Prime 
Ministerial visit. 
  -  Because a Democrat administration has been, 
thanks to the lingering Kennedy magic, always perceived as being 
"closer to India" than a Republican one. The PMO "cannot see the 
harm in going to Washington to meet a democrat president, 
especially the one who has already been called on by leaders of 
major countries such as China, Russia, Germany, the U.K. and 
France, not to mention Pakistan." Rather than "sit on a high 
horse," it is better to take advantage of the opportunity "to 
expand the areas of agreement and narrow down the areas of 
friction." 

  It is accepted that there will be some negative political 
fallout from the visit, but this has been taken as being an 
argument for an early visit, in that such a visit would give 
time to contain the fallout before assembly elections fall due 
in November. Thus, barring yet another Raphel-like 
embarrassment, the Prime Minister should be in the United States 
on a four-day visit by May.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Viswam: "N-Proliferation Can't Be </F>
Stopped--PM"] 
  [Text]London, March 15--Nuclear proliferation could 
not be stopped nor clandestine activity prevented without a 
global non-discriminatory regime, the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, said here on Tuesday. 
  In an exchange of views with the leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), Mr Paddy Ashdown, who called on him in 
the morning, the Prime Minister took the view that the basic 
issue in regard to proliferation was whether or not measures to 
prevent it was discriminatory or universal. 
  The nuclear proliferation theme, which figures for the first 
time in his talks with British leaders during the Prime 
Minister's current visit, was referred to by Mr Ashdown who 
enquired whether it was possible to have non-proliferation on a 
regional basis. Mr Rao's response was that it all depended on 
how a particular region was defined. In India's case, for 
example, both China and Russia had to be included. This was 
patently because the impact of certain countries extended far 
beyond their regions. 
  Significantly, apart from Mr Ashdown, none of the British 
leaders with whom Mr Rao has had discussions so far has referred 
to the subject of nuclear proliferation and India's approach to 
that question. 
  The better part of the discussions with Mr Ashdown was 
devoted to India-Pakistan relations in the specific context of 
their normalisation and India's ongoing economic reforms. Mr Rao 
explained to Mr Ashdown that while India's efforts to restore 
the political process in Kashmir continued, so also did 
Pakistan's efforts to sustain terrorism in the Valley continue. 
However, despite this, India acknowledged that Kashmir was its 
responsibility and consistent with that responsibility, India 
would do whatever was possible and necessary to normalise the 
situation in Jammu and Kashmir. 
  Mr Rao recalled that immediately after elections in 
Pakistan, 
he had suggested to the Pakistan Prime Minister, Ms Benazir 
Bhutto, that a dialogue between the two countries should take 
place. If the issue relating to Kashmir proved intractable, 
India had made it clear that constructive dialogue could be 
undertaken on other bilateral aspects. The picture, however, was 
not good right now. 
  Pakistan's response to India's six proposals as basis for a 
dialogue also had not been favourable. It seemed as if Pakistan 
wanted to close the doors whereas India wanted to and was trying 
to open them. From Pakistan's side, everything seemed to be done 
to cause rifts, the Prime Minister said. 
  Mr Rao made a similar assessment in his interview to the 
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) here, in which, in an 
obvious reference to Pakistan, he said that terrorism was being 
thrust upon India. "Both the gravity and intensity of the 
situation are worsening," he felt. The Prime Minister elaborated 
in the interview upon the theme of preparing for the restoration 
of the democratic process in Jammu and Kashmir which he had 
referred to in his talks with the British Premier, Mr John 
Major, on Monday. He said that the government was in touch with 
everyone who was interested in peace in Kashmir. Consultations 
were being held both at the national as well as the local level 
in Kashmir, he said. Mr Rao added that it was not a question of 
contacting the right people alone. The foremost question was of 
alleviating the situation. There was no dearth of democratic 
buffers in Kashmir. New alliances and parties would come up in 
the State once elections are held under the provisions of the 
Indian Constitution. He did not rule out the participation of 
the old democratic leadership in the political initiative. There 
were parties and leaders who had run governments in the past and 
are capable of running them in the future. 
  The Prime Minister, however, ruled out the possibility of 
early elections in the State. "We would go for it fully prepared 
as the consequences of hasty election can be disastrous," he 
said. Mr Rao cited the example of Punjab where an abrupt 
decision of holding elections in 1991 had led to the killings of 
as many as 27 candidates. Things could not be set right by 
pushing a button. 
  In his talks with Mr Ashdown, the Prime Minister said that 
the government wanted the economic reforms' benefits to 
percolate to the village level and not just stay in some 
localities spread over some parts of the country. India had 
embarked on a large programme of rural development. He felt that 
his government had struck the correct balance between fiscal 
prudence and social priorities. 
  Mr Rao emphasised the importance of striking such a balance 
in his address to scholars and India specialists later at the 
Nehru Centre. He said that it was a cause for satisfaction that 
the desire for peace, harmony and socio-economic development 
among the Indian people had prevailed over false religious 
slogans and tactics. But this had to be consolidated. In the 
final analysis what needed to be done was to tackle the causes 
of social unrest, most of which were quite unrelated to 
religion. "We want rapid industrialisation, full employment, 
meaningful induction of science and technology to subserve our 
social goals, and a general raising of the living standards, in 
which I insist on, including the imbibing of the country's 
immanent value system and cultural moors. The economic reforms 
we have undertaken are tailored to those objectives and are 
irreversible," he said. 
  In the process of change and adjustment, which India has 
undertaken, three postulates constituted the essential 
ingredients. First, that the economies of all nations needed to 
be globalised. Second, that the market was the best available 
instrument for achievement of the most efficient allocation of 
resources and that market forces should be generally relied upon 
to impart dynamism to the economy. And third, the role of the 
State needed to be reconsidered. Every society had to determine 
its own set of ends and means. Today, the issue of the means has 
been largely settled in favour of market forces and freer trade. 
But the issues regarding the ends, in other words, the 
determination of the core content of development, remained. In 
India's conditions, an equilibrium had to be achieved among 
three factors. First, that level of material benefit which is 
necessary for a human being to achieve his full creative 
potential, second, the level of exploitation of nature that 
would be consistent with the needs of nature to replenish 
itself, and third, the need to ensure a comparable benefit to 
the vast masses of people in countries where there are no 
welfare doles possible. To achieve and maintain such an 
equilibrium should not be considered stagnation. This level 
would depend upon and be pre-determined by the natural resources 
and the technology available at any point of time. To maintain 
economic activity at such a level, till technological progress 
achieved by the country raises the level itself, should not be 
considered a curtailment of the free play of market forces. This 
should be our considered approach--"the approach, if I may so, 
of variable constants." 
  Striking a realistic note, Mr Rao reminded his audience that 
there could never be a restful moment for India. "We are 
condemned and privileged to hard toil perpetually." 
  The Prime Minister was the guest of honour at a luncheon for 
him by the Indo-British Parliamentary Group, addressing whom he 
said that the courageous and right-thinking people, whether in 
Britain or in India were ranged against the challenges of the 
modern quick changing world. There was poverty and 
underdevelopment, the inescapable spectre of conflict in many 
parts of the world. International terrorism, drug trafficking, 
epidemics like the AIDS and the worldwide threat that religious 
fundamentalism and fanaticism posed. Through their elected 
Assemblies, India and Britain stood against the tides that 
threatened to flow over our hearths and homes. India and Britain 
could together be a positive force for international peace and 
stability. Together India and Britain could be a greater force 
in the areas of global trade, industry and advanced technologies.

  [Text] London, March 16--The Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today reaffirmed India's solemn commitment to 
fundamental freedoms as enshrined in the constitution and 
asserted that "there is no question of any going back on human 
rights of the individual citizens," reports PTI. 
  Speaking after paying his homage to the historic magna 
carta, 
a source of inspiration and a symbol of freedom under the law 
throughout the world, Mr Rao said the Indian constitution 
provides the individual freedoms in no uncertain terms and 
chapter three of the constitution on fundamental rights was full 
elaboration of the principles symbolised by the magna carta 
memorial. The memorial was erected at the spot at which King 
John and his barons put their seal to charter of magna carta 779 
years ago on June 15, 1215. 
  The Prime Minister unveiled a commemorative plaque and 
planted an English oak at the memorial on the bank of river 
Thames at Runnymede in Surrey about 25 km from here to mark 
significance of this symbol of freedom on India's development of 
democratic government. 
  Mr Rao briefly addressed the distinguished audience which 
had 
gathered at the memorial in the meadows of Surrey braving heavy 
showers and a mild hailstorm before the Prime Minister's 
arrival. The memorial was erected in 1957 by the American Bar 
Association whose central pillar bears the inscription "to 
commemorate magna carta, symbol of freedom under law." 
  The Indian Prime Minister is the second statesman after 
President, J.F. Kennedy to associate himself with the home of 
magna carta. 
  Mr Rao spoke about the human rights situation in India and 
said those in the administration knew how difficult it was for 
the government to conform to the stringent law of freedom in 
the Indian judicial system. "But we are doing and there is no 
question of going back on the fundamental freedom of the human 
rights of individual citizens." 
  Mr Rao ruled out India accepting any "regional" arrangement 
for nuclear non-proliferation and called for a global and 
non-discriminatory regime against proliferation. 
  "Proliferation could not be stopped nor clandestine activity 
prevented without a global and non-discriminatory regime," Mr 
Rao told Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown, during their 
30-minute meeting here on the third day of the Prime Minister's 
four-day official visit to the U.K. yesterday. 
  Aboard his aircraft, the Prime Minister said Britain's stand 
on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir "is not very far from 
ours." 
  On the British view on Kashmir, Mr Rao said that its 
position 
was not identical to India's "but on the whole it is not very 
far from our stand."

  [Text] On board the Prime Minister's aircraft from 
London to Edinburgh, March 16: Britain's stand on Kashmir, 
though not identical with that of India, was nonetheless not 
very far either, the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao said 
on Wednesday. 
  Talking to newsmen accompanying him on his visit to the 
United Kingdom on board his aircraft, the Prime Minister said 
that the three-point formula being advocated by Britain needed 
to be studied and analysed further. 
  He said he was aware of the British position and had seen 
the 
three points advanced by the British government in the recent 
past. 
  "On the whole," he said, "their position is not identical 
with ours, but then it is not very far either." 
  "We will study their position further before making an 
assessment," he added. 
  The three points advocated by Britian are first, a 
resumption 
of dialogue between India and Pakistan, second the restoration 
of the democratic process in Kashmir, and third, the cessation 
of external terrorism in the valley. 
  India, on the other hand, has been insisting that the 
Pakistan abetment of subversion and terrorism should cease first 
as a pre-condition for the normalisation of the situation in the 
valley. India has made it clear that it is very keen on 
restoring the political process in Kashmir, and it has also 
expressed its readiness to initiate bilateral discussion with 
Pakistan on Kashmir, and if Pakistan was not willing to do so, 
it was prepared to talk to Pakistan on settling other 
outstanding bilateral issues. 
  However, on the broader question of terrorism, which was a 
crucial element in respect of the Kashmir question, the views of 
India and Britain converged. Britain appeared to have a better 
understanding of what India is going through, what it is 
suffering and what the experience has been. Nothing illustrated 
better the impact of the "menace of terrorism" than the fact 
that a visitor to Britain had to go from airport to airport to 
land or take off to ward off danger from the menace. 
  The Prime Minister was obviously referring to the fact that 
following the series of mortar attacks on the Heathrow airport 
mounted by the IRA [Irish Republican Army] terrorists, his own 
aircraft had to be diverted to Gatwick, some 50 miles away, 
similarly, by way of abundant caution, the British arranged for 
his flight to Edinburgh from London take off not from Heathrow 
or Gatwick but from the royal air force base at Brize Norton, 
which is a two-hour drive from the heart of London. 
  "Just imagine," said the Prime Minister, "all this happening 
in their own capital and all because of terrorism. They are 
experiencing the same kind of terrorism which we have been 
experiencing. Therefore, there is no elaborate need for the two 
of us to convince each other about this menace." 
  Assessing the outcome of his goodwill visit to the United 
Kingdom, the Prime Minister said it had "gone off very well." 
His overall impression was that the atmosphere during the visit 
was great friendliness and greater closeness. 
  As a result of which both economic and political relations 
had firmed up on a constructive footing. The thrust of the 
discussions he had had with his counterpart, Mr Major, as well 
as with other British Ministers was a combination of both 
economic and political. 
  Apart from bilateral issues, he had the opportunity to 
discuss with them a lot of other issues in the international 
sphere, such as Bosnia and the crisis in that region. The 
British Prime Minister had informed him that there had been some 
improvement in the Bosnian situation and he expected the 
improvement to continue in the months to come. Asked whether 
India was being approached to send more troops to Bosnia, the 
Prime Minister said in the kind of situation which prevailed, 
there was no point in making new proposals. 
  The Prime Minister said he had seen newspaper reports in 
London about the intended purchase of Hawk trainer aircraft by 
India from Britain. Dismissing suggestions that the deal figured 
in the discussions, Mr Rao said that decisions in respect of 
acquisition of military hardware were not taken during visits 
such as his. There were established procedures for such 
transactions, and so if there was any impression that the visit 
was made as a result of decisions on such transactions it was 
erroneous. The Prime Minister left London for Edinburgh on the 
final lap of his journey after planting an oak tree at the Magna 
Carta Memorial, the first time, he said, that any world leader 
had been requested to do so on the spot where the charter was 
signed. The rights figuring in the charter were the same as he 
had been incorporated in chapter three of the Indian 
Constitution.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Viswam: "A Highly Successful Mission"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, March 17--"Mission accomplished"--could 
well be the sentiment governing the outcome of the Prime 
Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao's "highly successful" visit to the 
United Kingdom, from where he flew home on Thursday to continue 
the implementation of the "middle path" in India's economic 
reforms. 
  Mr Rao's visit to Britain was reciprocal in nature. He was 
returning the visit to India paid by his counterpart, Mr John 
Major in January 1993. Since it was made at a time when 
Indo-British relations are marked by an unexpected absence of 
rancour or recrimination, it was also in the nature of a 
goodwill visit. The current phase in bilateral relations is 
characterised by a new level in mutual understanding and 
cordiality. That by itself is noteworthy as an example of a free 
nation and its erstwhile colonial master working together in the 
global arena. 
  There were no political problems to be sorted out which 
necessitated a prime ministerial visit. Therefore, the mission 
to London had another objective, namely, to elevate and broaden 
the economic cooperation between the two countries. British 
media described the visit as a business-oriented one and talked 
in glowing terms about how London was taking or planned to take 
full advantage of the economic liberalisation programmes of 
India. 
  British big business looked at the visit with a kindly eye 
and good favour. Mr Rao's mission to do the spadework for 
attracting more and more British investment in India can be said 
to have been successfully achieved. In Mr Rao's own words, a 
positive and constructive thrust had been given by his visit to 
Indo-British political and economic cooperation. 
  One noticed that throughout his four-day stay in Britain, 
the 
contentious issues which normally form the subject of high-level 
discussions during any interaction between India and countries 
of the West were either absent or were touched upon only 
peripherally. Even the present-day controversial themes like 
human rights, Kashmir, Pakistan and nuclear non-proliferation, 
over which India is usually at the receiving end were raised and 
got out of the way quickly, without their impact being felt on 
bilateral relations. 
  Instead, the accent was more on investment and how the two 
countries would like to play the game, almost a new one for 
India, of investing and reaping profits. It is not without 
significance therefore that the Indian co-chairman of the 
Indo-British Partnership Initiative (IBPI), Mr J.J. Irani of 
TISCO [Tata Iron and Steel Company] described the current status 
of the initiative as "the wicket is full of runs" and the 
British co-chairman, Sir Robert Evans of British Gas responded 
by declaring that the IBPI had a good innings and "we intend to 
stay at the crease." 
  Symbolising this mutual desire to continue the partnership 
is 
the emergence of the unique document signed during Mr Rao's 
visit--Indo-UK bilateral agreement on promotion and protection 
of investments. It is unique because this is the first time in 
India's post-Independence history that it has entered into such 
an agreement with any country. It is also unique because the 
current size of Indian investment in Britain--a dozen or so 
joint ventures--would not have warranted the demand for 
protection. There is a certain measure of logic for Britain to 
seek such protection. India is a new entrant to the free market 
and its entry is not marked by across-the-board political 
endorsement in the country. Knowing that the outcome of the 
elections in India can never be predicted, and that there is 
always the possibility of the ballot returning to power a party 
which may not want to remain in the free market, Britain has 
good reason to seek protection for its investments in India. The 
agreement gives them that guarantee and assures them there is no 
danger of their investments being nationalised or their profits 
denied repatriation. The agreement itself is a comprehensive 
document covering a wide range of investments including 
Intellectual Property Rights. It would ensure that the foreign 
and domestic investors were treated at par in so far as 
compensations to investors in specific situations were concerned. 
  Though IBPI has had extraordinary success during the first 
year of its operation, the exchange of views between a 
delegation of Indian businessmen and British industrialists 
during Mr Rao's visit to London showed that the British continue 
to have reservations about the course of the economic reforms. 
For instance, the Indian labour laws generated considerable 
interest. Some British participants pointed out that India 
should not take its superior competitiveness in some areas for 
granted as over-manning led to increased costs which eroded 
competitiveness. Dr Irani said that labour relations in India is 
an extremely sensitive subject which had to be handled with 
care. In other words, while he appreciated the British concern, 
he could not guarantee an exit policy which would suit the 
investors. Similarly, British businessmen who were interested in 
the opening of the insurance sector in India wanted to know 
whether the Government of India would be open to suggestions 
from them with regard to further reform and whether the 
liquidity ratios would be favourable to foreign insurance 
companies. 
  Mr Narasimha Rao appears to have returned home convinced 
that 
Mr John Major would encourage and bless the private sector 
investor to go to India on a much larger scale than they are 
coming now. The implication of his prognosis of improved 
Indo-British economic cooperation, therefore, means that he 
found the climate favourable for attracting a greater volume of 
investment. A good beginning in this direction was made during 
his visit. The names of the companies involved in the MoUs 
signed speak for themselves. They are all stable and powerful 
industrial units like Rolls Royce, GEC, GPT and Peebles 
Electric. Their involvement in India would add prestige to 
Indo-British economic cooperation. When big companies come in on 
their own assured of a fair return, medium and small-sized 
companies are sure to follow. 
  Thus, it would seem that Mr Rao's visit generated among 
British businessmen the necessary confidence in the direction of 
the economic reforms and the soundness of the current policies. 
This is a major gain from the visit. It is not everyday that a 
British Premier hosts a lunch in honour of a visiting Prime 
Minister and the guest list shows a preponderance of both Indian 
and British businessmen. The very fact that the two Prime 
Ministers jointly received the progress report of the IBPI from 
the two co-chairmen automatically gave the venture full official 
backing. This was reassuring to Indian and British businessmen 
alike. 
  On the political front too, there were gains. Terrorism 
needs 
to be deplored, wherever it occurs. But the mortar attacks by 
the Irish Republican Army (IRA) terrorists on Heathrow, 
necessitating the diversion of the Prime Minister's aircraft to 
Gatwick for his arrival, and the choice of a Royal Air Force 
(RAF) air base for his departure, underlined a point India has 
been making for the last several years. Terrorism's targets, 
whether they are Indians or British, are equal sufferers. As the 
Prime Minister pointed out, being themselves the victims of 
terrorism, the British were in a better position now to 
appreciate India's concerns. The implications of Pakistan's 
abetment of terrorism in the Kashmir Valley, therefore, did not 
have to be explained by Mr Rao to his hosts nor did he need to 
be apologetic about the pressures he is under in Kashmir. 
  The British position on Kashmir has been well known to 
India. 
Three points constitute this position: (I) resumption of a 
substantive Indo-Pakistan dialogue on the basis of the Shimla 
Agreement; (II) initiation of the political process in Kashmir; 
and (III) cessation of external support to militants. This 
position, first outlined by Mr Douglas Hurd in October 1992 has 
since been reiterated several times both at the official and 
political levels. 
  The Kashmir issue was not on the agenda of the summit 
meeting 
this time in London: it came up in passing, by way of 
information-sharing on the current situation. And the British 
were satisfied by Mr Rao's confirmation that preliminary 
measures are already on hand to initiate the political process 
in Kashmir. Mr Rao has returned home reasonably assured that 
the British are unlikely to make a song and dance about Kashmir 
and Indo-Pakistan relations in the near future. 
  The British role in Geneva at the time of the voting on 
Pakistan's resolution was particularly helpful to India. Britain 
and Germany were able to prevail upon the other members of the 
European Union not to support Pakistan. Even on the human rights 
issue, the British position is mild compared to the strident one 
of the United States. Thus, on the whole, the stage has been set 
by Mr Rao's visit to Britain for not only enhanced cooperation 
between the two countries but also for better mutual 
understanding. Frequent high-level contacts always result in 
this, and Mr Rao's just-concluded visit has been no exception.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 5 (UNI)--The Prime Minister, Mr 
P.V. Narasimha Rao, on Tuesday strongly denounced attempts by 
the developed nations to create fresh impediments in the form of 
"unjustified controversies" that would nullify the comparative 
advantage to developing countries in the globalisation process 
of their economies. 
  Inaugurating the golden jubilee session of the United 
Nations 
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) 
here, the Prime Minister said the successful conclusion of the 
Uruguay Round of trade related bilateral negotiations should not 
"countenance any moves to put these concerns on the trade 
agenda, with the thinly veiled intention to nullify the 
comparative advantage of the developing countries." 
  Economic and trade ministers of more than 20 countries are 
taking part in the week-long 50th session which is expected to 
express concern over the neo-protectionism attitude being 
adopted by the industrialised world. 
  Referring to the new conditions being imposed on the third 
world by the developed nations, Mr Narasimha Rao said the 
"legitimate concern for environmental preservation and 
upgradation should not, however, be made the alibi for raising 
of protectionist trade barriers, since only augmentation of 
trade and technology flows would provide the necessary resources 
for a transition to more environmentally friendly products and 
processes. On meeting the challenges posed by environment 
degradation, which was going to assume "gigantic proportions" in 
the coming century, the Prime Minister advised all ESCAP members 
to adopt agenda 21 of the Rio declaration on environment 
development. 
  The ESCAP session is being held here after a gap of nearly 
two decades. Last it met here was in March 1975. 
  Referring to the role of ESCAP the Prime Minister was 
confident that the deliberations would be distinctly useful and 
contribute further towards promoting the spirit of regional 
cooperation for the overall development of this region. 
  "For Asia and the Pacific region, ESCAP has been the torch 
bearer and catalyst for economic and social development and has 
provided an added impetus to the process of growth in this 
region," he pointed out. 
  Drawing the attention of the gathering to the disapperance 
of 
the super power rivalry and the era of the cold war, he said 
this had created "expectations of a peaceful future and fostered 
an environment conducive to the enhancement of regional 
cooperation. 
  "The world is witnessing a general movement of the 
restructuring of economies away from command and control systems 
to market-based ones. The winds of change have affected Asia 
also. The unifying forces of development in the region should 
cement mutual relations and create a climate of confidence and 
faith," the Prime Minister emphasised. He called upon the member 
countries to unitedly strive for development of the region. 
  Referring to the world economic scenario, the Prime Minister 
said the present recession was creating economic problems. There 
were other parts, though not developed as yet, that were 
witnessing substantial and consistently high rates of growth. 
  "This establishes the complementarity that needs to be 
exploited for securing overall global welfare," he pointed out. 
The fast growing economies provide the opportunities that the 
economies in recession require to achieve revival. It was 
therefore important that this be understood by the developed and 
developing countries alike. 
  Emphasising, that the need of the hour was "cooperation and 
not confrontation," Mr Narasimha Rao said the countries of the 
North should appreciate the desire of the developing countries 
to catch up with the rest of the world. It would be 
counter-productive to create problems on narrow short-term 
considerations, he cautioned. 
  It was in this perspective that the free flow of resources, 
capital, technology and market access had become more relevant 
than ever before to give a strong impetus to global economic 
growth, he said. 
  On the Asia Pacific region, he said for reasons of history, 
geography and culture it had gained a distinct ethos which joins 
together the mosaic of cultures and ethnic groups constituting 
this region. 
  The economies of this region had achieved "some of the 
highest growth rates in the world today," and become the subject 
of analyses for economic and political planners all over the 
world. 
  Trade and flow of investment within the region too had grown 
phenomenally giving this region the basis for forging a distinct 
Asian-Pacific identity and unity. 
  The development of this identity would be realised if the 
sub-regional cooperation groupings such as SAARC [South Asian 
Association for Regional Cooperation] and ASEAN [Association of 
South East Asia Nations] could serve as building blocks towards 
developing and strengthening inter-sub-regional and region-wise 
cooperation, he opined. "We are observing a general tendency of 
national boundaries going down. Even the sub-regional groupings 
are expanding as is illustrated in the emergence of APEC (Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation)." Stating that it was necessary to 
address the economic and social issues before us in a wider 
framework than national/subregional perspectives, Mr Narasimha 
Rao said there was need for strengthening the socio-economic 
development programmes under the "one single umbrella of ESCAP" 
rather than duplicating and dividing them. 
  ESCAP should thus play the role of a coordinator and 
catalyst 
for the promotion of region-wise trade and economic cooperation 
and for strengthening the economic ties between the sub-regional 
grouping. 
  The Prime Minister said a large number of countries 
continued 
to battle against poverty, deprivation and unemployment. "We 
have to find a solution of these problems, which inevitably 
involves reforms, but the reforms must have a human face. The 
pace, range and scope of restructuring programmes should not 
burden those sections of society least able to bear them. 
  Massive upgradation of education, health care, housing and 
transport are called for immediately. Though implementation of 
policies and programmes to alleviate poverty are primarily the 
responsibility of member countries, the support of the UN 
bodies in this gigantic task was essential, the Prime Minister 
said.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 4--Israel would like to see India 
play an "intensive part" in the multi-lateral peace efforts in 
West Asia, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Israel, Mr Yossi 
Beilin, told reporters here today while replying to questions at 
a press conference. 
  He hinted at the "limitless" scope of cooperation between 
the 
two countries. Though Israel had no specific plans, he said it 
could sell arms to India and share its experiences in tackling 
problems relating to agriculture and water scarcity. India and 
Israel could also join in helping developing countries such as 
those of the CIS in the former Soviet Union. 
  He also said that Israel hoped to establish diplomatic 
relations "very soon" with several Muslim countries that 
included the Gulf nations, Morocco and Tunisia. These countries 
were awaiting the implementation of the peace process in West 
Asia. 
  Mr Beilin, who had signed an agreement on civil aviation 
ties 
between the two countries with Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad, the Union 
Minister for Civil Aviation, before attending the press 
conference, spoke warmly of his talks with several Indian 
leaders of the ruling party as well as the Opposition, including 
the Foreign Minister, Mr Dinesh Singh, and Mr L.K. Advani, the 
BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] president.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 11--Yemen today extended 
wholehearted support to India's stand on the Kashmir issue and 
denounced interference in the "internal affairs of any country 
by external forces," reports UNI. 
  The Yemeni foreign minister, Mr Mohammed Saleem Basendwa, 
who 
held extensive talks with the external affairs minister, Mr 
Dinesh Singh, on cross-border terrorism and regional issues, 
said India and Pakistan should resolve the Kashmir issue through 
a dialogue. The two countries should not report to "polemics and 
violence," he further said. 
  This was the first-ever visit by a cabinet minister to India 
from unified Yemen. 
  He expressed serious concern at the menace of growing 
fundamentalism and terrorism in the world. He supported India's 
concern on cross-border terrorism, which pose a serious threat 
to the country's unity and integrity. 
  The two sides felt there was a great scope for strengthening 
mutually beneficial relations in the field of irrigation, 
telecommunications, health sector and trade. 
  Mr Basendwa invited investment from India in development 
projects and also sought training of Yemeni students in 
professional institutions in India, mainly in areas of 
engineering, management and electronics.

<F P=106> [Article by Subrata Sen: "S.S. Ray Likely to Leave </F>
Washington by November"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, April 11--While the United States is 
clearing the decks for the appointment of its Ambassador to 
India, a post lying vacant for about 17 months, the Indian 
Ambassador to Washington, Mr Siddhartha Shankar Ray, is 
reportedly preparing to return sometime in November. 
  Sources said that Mr Ray--during his recent six-day visit to 
the country--had received an indication that the Prime Minister 
was not averse to the idea. Officially, Mr Ray denies that he 
will return by the end of the year. 
  During an informal chat with reporters, just before leaving 
for Washington early this morning, Mr Ray said that it was too 
early to discuss the issue. "There is plenty of time to think 
about this. In any case I have some more months to serve there," 
he said. 
  However, sources said that after getting the indication from 
appropriate quarters, Mr Ray had asked his family friends to 
arrange for the renovation of his two houses: one at Friends 
Colony in New Delhi; the other at Beltolla Road in Calcutta. 
Also, he has reportedly asked that the houses be ready by the 
end of October. 
  A source added: "If he comes back, he is no more interested 
in politics in West Bengal but would like to spend more of his 
time in New Delhi." Incidentally, Mr Ray was the president of 
the West Bengal Pradesh Congress(I) and a member of the State 
Assembly, before he was appointed the Ambassador to Washington 
in November 1992. 
  It is not clear whether Mr Ray will be involved in politics 
at the national level once he comes back. 
  Talking to reporters at his New Delhi residence on Sunday, 
Mr 
Ray had said that he would be using his trip to Jammu and 
Kashmir, where he went to collect "facts" on terrorist 
activities to consolidate India's position on the issue of 
Pak-aided terrorism. He claimed that he had collected figures 
during his two-day trip to J&amp;K [Jammu &amp; Kashmir] for the 
"purpose of showing that Pakistani interference is still 
continuing in the Valley."

  [Text] New Delhi, April 12--The Union home minister, Mr 
S.B. Chavan, today ruled out any economic and political package 
for initiating the political process in insurgency-hit Jammu and 
Kashmir saying such a package could be given only after the 
installation of an elected government, report agencies. 
  Talking to journalists here after laying the foundation 
stone 
of a seven-storeyed headquarters of the Intelligence Bureau 
(IB), Mr Chavan said the government had no objections to having 
a dialogue with Kashmir militants. 
  But, he made it clear that talks could be held only under 
the 
constitution. "Going beyond the constitution is just ruled out," 
he asserted. 
  The home ministry has evolved a country-wide intelligence 
network to counter the threat posed by the Inter-Services 
Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan. 
  Talking to journalists in Jammu last night the internal 
security minister, Mr Rajesh Pilot, said that the ISI was trying 
its best to destabilise and disturb the peace in the country and 
recent arrests of some activists revealed that they were 
planning sabotage and create disruption at a number of places in 
the country. 
  "We have evolved a co-ordinated approach involving 
intelligence agencies all over the country to meet the challenge 
posed by the ISI," he added. 
  He said that the ISI would not be allowed to succeed in its 
designs and declared that a lot of success has been achieved 
through this co-ordinated approach in checking its activities. 
  He said to check the influence of the ISI in the 
North-Eastern and "operational command" of seven states had been 
formed. 
  Fresh instructions have been given to the IB to meet the 
senior police and civil officials once a week at the district 
level to have a clear picture of the situation. "We should be 
able to prevent a certain event from taking place instead of 
waiting for it to happen," he added. 
  Mr Pilot said that a decision regarding starting of a 
political process and reactivating the administration in Jammu 
and Kashmir would be taken by the Prime Minister in a few days 
after consultations with all political parties. 
  Mr Pilot indicated that the idea of appointing "political 
advisors" had virtually been given up due to opposition from 
certain quarters. He said that he had conveyed to the prime 
minister the need to evolve a certain political mechanism for 
the Kashmir Valley. 
  "Political process takes you towards normalisation as 
politicians can go down to the grassroots level to look into the 
grievances of the people. 
  Mr Pilot said that he favoured a political advisory council 
consisting of politicians and having certain administrative 
powers to solve the problems of the people. 
  He said to speed up the developmental works in the state 
special high level teams from various ministries were visiting 
the state. "We have already settled about 14,000 of the 18,000 
insurance claims cases in the state. Others will be settled very 
soon." 
  Mr Pilot said that the Centre was also thinking of setting 
up 
of a Kashmir infrastructure reconstruction fund to speed up 
development activities in areas badly hit by militancy. "The 
prime minister is also in favour of such a fund and final 
touches are being given to it," he said. 
  Mr Pilot said he had conveyed to the prime minister the 
feelings of various political leaders, including Dr Farooq 
Abdullah and the state Congress president, Mr Ghulam Rasool Kar, 
over the delay in announcing some kind of political, 
administrative and economic package for the people of Kashmir. 
  Describing the situation in Doda as "complex" Mr Pilot said 
security forces had been instructed to re-define their strategy 
and results would follow soon. 
  Mr Pilot said that although there were limitations regarding 
the availability of forces, he had ordered additional BSF 
[Border Security Forces] and CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force] 
troops for the state. 
  Referring to some provocations by Pak troops along Indo-Pak 
border, he said "India is a peace-loving country and we will not 
be provoked by these pinpricks. However, he said if Pakistan 
stretched India's patience too far, it would be bad for that 
country." 
  TOINS [Times of INdia News Service] adds: The 
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) today demanded that the Prime 
Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, visit Kashmir and take some 
firm steps to restore normalcy in the state. The party suggested 
that the government prepare an action plan. 
  The party spokesman, Mr K.L. Sharma, said the situation in 
the state was grave, and the Prime Minister should take personal 
notice of it. He said the government's claim that the situation 
in the Valley was gradually improving was a "cruel joke." 
  Meanwhile, the high-level Central team headed by Mr K.R. 
Venugopal, secretary in the prime minister's office, today held 
discussions on the overall development of the state with the 
governor, Gen K.V. Krishna Rao. 
  An official spokesman said in Jammu the team was with the 
governor for nearly two hours and issues covered related to 
Central schemes, rural development, health and education and 
ways and means of speeding up various works in the state.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 30--Expanded list of imports under 
the Special Import Licence (SIL) covering a host of items, 
introduction of a new category of super star trading houses, 
simplification of duty exemption scheme and continuation of 
value-based advance licensing (VBAL) with some safeguards are 
the salient points of the important changes in the export-import 
(Exim) policy, reports PTI. 
  The modifications announced to the 1992-97 Exim policy by 
the 
Union commerce minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, in Lok Sabha 
today, also paid special attention to the simplification and 
streamlining of the procedural aspects of the Exim policy. 
  To make the SIL financially more attractive, a number of 
items relating to healthcare, sports, communication and office 
equipment, some consumer goods/consumer durables not reserved 
for SSI [Small-Scale Industry] units and spares and components 
are being permitted under the modified policy. All existing 
valid licences and the ones issued hereafter will be eligible 
for import of these items of payment of normal custom duty. 
  For import of second-hand machinery, the condition of 
maximum 
seven years of age as well as submission of chartered engineer 
certificate has been dispensed with. 
  The commerce minister said the important changes being 
announced in the Exim policy take effect from today. 
  For deemed exports, the policy is designed to strengthen 
industrial base by offering more facilities to indigenous 
manufacturers. The duty-free licence holders would be able to 
source their goods from local manufacturers instead of importing 
the same with an added advantage of deemed export benefits. 
  The facility of advance release order has been extended to 
special imprest licences, advance intermediate licences, 
transferred advance licences and sensitive list items in terms 
of value. 
  The powers to grant export promotion capital goods (EPCG) 
licence, currently centralised in the office of the director 
general of foreign trade, is centralised, Mr Mukherjee said. 
Regional officers can now permit imports up to Rs 25 [rupees] 
lakhs. 
  For 100 percent export-oriented units (EOUs) export 
processing zone sector, their areas of activity have been 
broadened by providing for trading, re-export after repacking 
and labelling and also repairs, reconditioning and 
re-engineering. 
  The requirement of prior approval of development 
commissioner 
of EPZs [Export Processing Zone] for inter-unit transfer has 
been dispensed with. EOUs/EPZ units debonding modalities have 
been liberalised and procedures for third party exports by 
these units have been further simplified. 
  The new policy also has taken away some components required 
for the manufacture of finished products in the electronic 
industry. Fishermen can now import outboard motors freely. 
  Relaxation has been provided for the import of 
prototypes/samples for product development. 
  For the import and export of items which are not covered by 
the negative lists of exports and imports, the restriction of 
value addition, which was acting as an irritant has been removed. 
  Under the special import licence, the minister said the 
fillip provided to the exporters by SIL was not serving the 
desired objective as the premium on these freely tradable SILs 
has dropped to very low levels due to general import 
liberalisation. As such, it has been decided to render the SILs 
more attractive by including a host of items. However, gold and 
silver will now be importable against SIL on concessional rate 
payment of customs duty in foreign exchange, as applicable to 
incoming passengers, by the holders of EEFC [expansion not 
given] account. 
  On VBAL, the minister said a marginal misuse by unscrupulous 
elements should not be allowed to create hardships for the 
larger number of genuine exporters. 
  As such, he said the scheme is being continued with 
safeguards. Procedures have been simplified under the duty 
exemption scheme. Minimum value addition under the advance 
customs clearance permit has been reduced from 15 to 10 percent. 
Third party exports under the scheme will now be permitted. 
  Four zonal licensing committees have been set up at Delhi, 
Bombay, Calcutta and Madras with a view to rendering quick, 
efficient service and they will permit licences up to Rs one 
crore in respect of cases where norms have not yet been fixed. 
  Revalidation and export obligation procedures under VBAL 
scheme have been further streamlined by permitting regional 
offices to allow extension up to 12 months. Input-output norms 
have now been finalised for 3,383 items as against 2,200 on 
March 31, 1993. 
  For Small Scale Industry (SSI), it is permitted to increase 
their capacity by way of investment inplant and equipment beyond 
Rs 75 lakhs, provided they undertake a minimum export obligation 
of 75 percent of their annual production. 
  In a bid to ensure cost effectiveness and in order to make 
the life of exporters less bothersome, legal undertaking (LUT) 
has been further rationalised. LUT limit granted to export 
houses/trading houses/star trading houses which was three times 
of the last year's exports, will now be five times and in 
respect of other exporters, LUT limit has been enhanced two 
times from one-and-a-half times permitted earlier. 
  Unlimited LUT facility has now been extended to super star 
trading houses. 
  Exporters under advance licence scheme can now give the bank 
guarantee in two parts in respect of licences issued for a value 
of one crore of rupees and above. In other cases, they can 
replace their original bank guarantee with a reduced value after 
completing 50 percent of exports. 
  The requirement of supporting manufacturer to be indicated 
in 
the DEEC [expansion not given] book has been dispensed with. 
  Handicapped persons can now import cars fitted with special 
controls. Items relating to computerised braille printing 
presses, text reading system for visually handicapped, spherical 
lenses of magnification like spectacle magnifier, hand held 
magnifier and table magnifier will now be permitted to be 
imported freely. Artificial limbs for physically handicapped and 
disabled and frequently modulated hearing aid systems for 
hearing impaired persons in group situation will also be freely 
imported, Mr Mukherjee said. 
  Explaining the details of the new category of super star 
trading houses, the minister said all those exporters with trade 
turnover of Rs 750 crores average free on board (FoB) during the 
preceding three licensing years of Rs 1,000 crores during the 
preceding year are eligible to become the super star trading 
houses. 
  Such houses, he said, would be entitled to the membership of 
apex consultative bodies concerned with trade policy and 
promotion, representation in important business delegations, 
special permission for overseas trading and special import 
licences at enhanced rate.

with a call for organisational unification of the trade unions, 
to wage battle against the new economic policies of the Central 
government, which, according to it, was dictated by the IMF and

globalisation. 
  Briefing mediapersons on the concluding day of the five-day 
conference, the newly elected general secretary of the AITUC, Mr 
A.B. Bardhan, said that it was felt at the conference that there 
should be one union in an establishment, one industrial 
federation at state and national levels and one central trade 
union at the national level, which would function democratically 
and independently. The AITUC had called upon unions at the 
grassroot level and trade union centres to come together on the 
basis of a common outlook and common programme of action, he 
added. 
  Commenting on the demand of the Centre for Indian Trade 
Union 
(CITU) for formation of a confederation of all trade unions, Mr 
Bardhan said that it could be the beginning, but it was not 
enough. The merger of trade unions should be the ultimate aim. 
Hence, the current session welcomed the decision of the AITUC 
and the Hind Majdoor Sabha (HMS) to constitute co-ordination 
committees at different levels, with a view to pave the way for 
an eventual merger. Such a committee at the national level had 
already been formed, Mr Bardhan said. 
  The resolution, adopted at the conference, says that 
transnational corporations are being given free access almost in 
every sphere and public sector enterprises are being 
systematically dismantled. Workers and employees are facing the 
grim prospect of closure, retrenchment and mass unemployment 
under the new economic policies. Alongside this, national unity 
and integrity are being endangered by communal and other 
divisive forces. The country's independence and sovereignty are 
under grave threats. 
  The resolution on minimum wages adopted at the conference 
pointed to the fact that much larger section of workers were in 
the unorganised sector and there was disparity in wages in 
various states and hence this disparity within a region should 
be removed.

<F P=106> [Article by Suman Chattopadhyay: "Congress Party Faces </F>
Disunity in Every State But the West Bengal Case Is Exceptional"] 
  [Excerpts] The question of whether or not two fellow 
travelers converse with one another arises only in the Congress 
(I). This is the situation we find today between Somen Mitra and 
Mamata Bandapadhyay. 
  Disunity within the Congress (I) is routine news. Unity is 
the exeption. This is important in the case of Somen, Congress's 
elected president [in Bengal] and Mamata, Congress's most 
popular leader [in Bengal]. They have been at odds with each 
other for years and are only now talking of unity. Five years 
ago, Somen Mitra never dreamed that he, the general, would have 
a lieutenant named Mamata. Times change, however, and he has 
survived [while opposing Mamata] only due to others standing 
beside him. Many of those, however, who stood beside him, have 
gone their separate paths. At that time also, Somen and Mamata 
had not intensely clashed. Their rivalry has grown in its 
intensity. So what has happened to cause them to sound a unity 
theme? 
  The answer lies in Delhi. Somen's writ ran out in April. 
Congress's working committee in Delhi made a decision that state 
organizational leadership will be determined by Narasimha Rao. 
Now both Somen and Mamata want to be seen by Delhi as guiding a 
unified Bengal Congress. One seeks to hold onto the reigns of 
power while the other, who saw it slip away two years ago, wants 
to appear disciplined in the effort to gain power. So both have 
adopted the same strategies though their factions remain intact. 
The stategy works only on paper. [passage omitted on meetings in 
Delhi] 
  If Somen and Mamata really want to work out their 
differences, they do not need Delhi's help. They can give Bengal 
Congress a new face. This unity, however, will elude them. Those 
who with Somen, opposed Mamata, will not allow unity, forming a 
new faction if necessary. By resigning from his post as State 
Party Vice-President, Subrata Mukherjee has done just that. 
Mamata will also lose many in her faction by standing with 
Somen. Neither wants to take this huge risk too far. 
  It is not just this state's Congress party which experiences 
disunity. In fact, if we open our eyes, we will see its like 
this most everywhere. In Tamil Nadu, G. K. Mupaner and Ram 
Murti, A.K. Anthony and Karunakaran in Kerala as well as Vijay 
Baskar Reddy and Raj Shekhar in Andhra Pradesh all have 
competing factions. So do Madhav Singh Solanki and Prabodh 
Rabhal in Gujarat, Sharad Pawar and Shankar Rao Chavan in 
Maharashtra and Arjun Singh and Vidhya Charan Shukla in Madhya 
Pradesh. Even Jagannath Mishra and Sitaram Keshari of Bihar and 
Tripura's Sudhir Mazumdar and Samiranjan Barman have factions. 
At times, factional fighting in these regions is more severe 
than that in Bengal. 
  Congress' image in states ruled by the Left Front or by 
Janata Dal factions is decidedly worse. But factionalism is not 
the cause of losing elections. Bengal serves as the perfect 
example of this. The constant fighting and hair-pulling 
[backstabbing] between leaders is what loses elections. This is 
hard to prove with statistics. 
  It is arithmitic which argues against Congress winning 
elections in Bengal, not factionalism. Jyoti Basu and the CPM 
[Communist Party India-Marxist] have won four consecutive 
elections due to arithmitic being in their favor. [passage 
omitted on election results] 
  Congress sees an opportunity before it now. Somen and Mamata 
each have the ability to confront the leftists as Narasimha Rao 
and Manmohan Singh have at the national level. But they will not 
take this path. They proved this by not challenging CPM over the 
state budget and by not being vocal over Dunkel [Signing of the 
GATT Treaty], allowing CPM to claim whatever it wanted. Somen 
Mitra, instead spent all of his energy fighting Youth Congress 
leader Mamata Bandhapadhyay. Maybe this is why Delhi is now 
beginning to coerce unity.

<F P=106> [Article by Ashok Row Kavi: "RSS Too Plays the Caste Card" </F>
-- all quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Bombay, March 15--It is about as revolutionary as 
the Princes of the Roman Catholic Church electing a black bishop 
as Pope. A little over half a century after it was born as the 
Brahminical response to the challenges of colonial India, the 
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has a `Sarsangchalak' from the 
non-Brahmin castes within the Varna-system. 
  The 79-year-old faltering head of the RSS, Balasaheb Deoras 
(Dada to his close circle), has stepped down; in line with RSS 
heads nominating their successors, Deoras has hand-picked Prof. 
Rajendra Singh, as his heir. 
  Brushing aside the close coterie of South India Brahmins who 
have risen fast within the gargantuan body that will carry on 
the mandate of `Hindutva', Deoras has broken with the past. 
  Prof. Rajendra Singh, Rajju-Bhayya to the Sevaks, the first 
non-Brahmin to head the RSS, comes from the backward Kshatriya 
castes of the cowbelt. The battle with both the forces of Mandal 
and Kanshi Ram has now been truly joined. 
  For the last 10 years, it was Rajju-Bhayya's mandate to 
expand the incredible social net of the RSS into backward areas 
like slums and Dalit bustis. This appointment is, 
therefore, a clear indication to Brahmins that the RSS is 
serious about its mission to broadbase its cadre. It is also a 
snub to the Pune-Nagpur Chitpavan-Deshasth-Kokanasth Brahmin 
elite of Maharashtra; they have been effectively sidelined by 
the old man himself. 
  As the saying in the Konkan goes, the Mother Banana Plant 
kills herself to let her daughter grow. In a similar fashion, 
the RSS is now sidelining the Brahmins to accommodate the great 
big push from below. However, unlike the chaotic political 
electoral process the RSS is doing it systematically, opening up 
its powerlines to let the backward caste muscle rise to the top. 
  Rajju-Bhayya, like Deoras, started as a common foot soldier 
in the formative years of the Sangh. Both remain bachelors and 
have worked together right from the beginning. Prof. Rajendra 
Singh has cut his teeth as the General-Secretary and has 
maintained close contacts with Marxists in Allahabad University 
where another illustrated RSS-ite worked in the faculty--Dr 
Murli Manohar Joshi. Hence, he is eminently suited to bridge the 
widening gap between the RSS and Bharatiya Janata Party in the 
coming future over the RSS' new Swadeshi policy. 
  Prof. Rajendra Singh, against great odds, first pushed the 
RSS to a positive discrimination towards backwards and Dalits. 
It was said to be his idea to get the ground broken at Ayodhya 
for the Shilanyas by a Dalit. This has empowered numerous Dalit 
castes like the Valmikis, leather workers like Chamars and even 
agricultural tribals like the Dangs and Mangs to join the RSS in 
1989. 
  It was also during his tenure as General Secretary that the 
RSS started analysing the Mutiny and the national movement in 
material terms. The ORGANISER had a series of articles on a 
proto-Marxist analysis of the rising bourgeoise who were crushed 
by the British during the Mutiny in 1857 which is at variance 
with the Marxist analysis that it was a purely feudal revolt. 
  Prof. Rajendra Singh will now have to coordinate the RSS' 
new 
focus on Ayodhya and face up [to] the Mulayam-Kanshi Ram Axis 
which will seek to pit the backward-Dalit castes against the 
upper castes. He knows full well that whereas the backwards have 
both the muscle and monetary power, the Dalits have the mass 
base. 
  The alliance between the two is basically unstable: if the 
Mulayam-Kanshir Ram regime goes in for serious land reforms, it 
loses the backward-kulak social base of the Samajwadi 
Party and if it doesn't, it loses its landless Dalit 
constituency. Either way, the RSS stands to gain.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 18--The newly-appointed 
Sarsanghchalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Prof 
Rajendra Singh, on Friday described the Supreme Court judgment 
regarding invocation of Article 356 of the Constitution to 
dismiss State governments as "controversial" which needed 
interpretation and elaboration by legal experts. 
  Addressing his first press conference after his elevation to 
the top post in the RSS, Prof Singh, who is popularly known as 
Rajju Bhayya, said his personal feeling was that the apex court 
had not appreciated the depth of the issue. Article 356 had been 
a part of the Constitution from the very beginning, whereas the 
word "secularism" was introduced in the mid-70s during the 
Emergency. The judgment appeared to place undue emphasis on this 
later entrant into the Constitution. It was foolish for anyone 
even to suggest that the majority community needs to be educated 
about secularism, it being an integral part of the Indian 
heritage, he said. 
  Dwelling on the concept of "Hindutva" as espoused by the 
Sangh Parivar, Prof Singh said he welcomed the ongoing debate on 
the subject. For him the word signified the entire spiritual and 
cultural background of the country. It had nothing to do with 
anyone's personal faith, but the general loyalty to the nation. 
Unfortunately, there was a leadership in this country which did 
not allow this to be appreciated by a section of the people, he 
said. 
  Reiterating his organisation's commitment to persist with 
the 
Ayodhya movement, the RSS chief said construction of a temple at 
Ayodhya would be the first priority even as it considered the 
liberation of temples at Mathura and Varanasi as important. 
  Prof Singh, who maintained that the various wings of the 
Sangh Parivar were totally independent of each other, 
nonetheless willingly answered questions on various Bharatiya 
Janata Party (BJP) leaders. He defended the BJP president, Mr 
L.K. Advani's remarks abroad supporting the government's 
economic policies. Criticism as an Opposition party did not mean 
that one runs down his own country's government in foreign 
countries. At the same time, it was not far off the mark that 
the BJP did welcome some aspects of the ongoing liberalisation 
process. It supported the simplification of procedures 
internally but not the unhindered entry of multinationals into 
the country. Definitely not for potato chips and coke, he said. 
  Mr A.B. Vajpayee had been sent by the government for the 
human rights meet at Geneva because of his vast experience and 
knowledge of foreign affairs and also because of his personal 
contacts with leaders of different countries. His efforts to 
ensure that the national prestige was held high at the 
international forum did not mean that the BJP was joining hands 
with the Congress, Prof Singh stated. 
  Reacting to the reverses the BJP suffered in last year's 
Assembly elections, Prof Singh said the results were not as bad 
as was being made out. Secondly, there was an element of chance 
in elections and a political party which loses one election 
comes back to power in the next. Another factor he identified 
was the ban on the RSS which had made it difficult for its 
volunteers to work for the party.

<F P=106> [Two-part interview with RSS Head Rajendra Singh by Gopal </F>
Sharma in Keshav Kunj on 19 Mar] 
  [22 Mar p 1] 
  [Text] Appointed recently the chief (sarsanghchalak) 
of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Rajendra Singh spoke 
to THE STATESMAN's Gopal Sharma at Keshav Kunj, the 
RSS headquarters in New Delhi, on Saturday. Excerpts: 
  THE STATESMAN: Were you expecting to be nominated as 
sarsanghchalak? 
  Rajendra Singh: The process of choosing a 
successor to Balasaheb Deoras had started three years ago 
because of his deterioriating health. There were six top-ranking 
RSS leaders who were being considered as probable successors to 
him. They included Abhaji Thatte, Sudershanji, H.V. Seshadri, 
Suresh Rao and Moroplant Pingle besides myself. 
  Three months ago, Deorasji had come to Delhi and indicated 
that he wanted to relinquish office. I had pleaded with him to 
nominate a younger person so that he could have a long tenure in 
office. But he was determined to choose his successor. 
  The normal procedure of selection is that the reigning 
sarsanghchalak must consult the 20-member working 
committee and also ascertain the views of 120 special invitees 
to the committee. He had done it and made up his mind. My name 
as his successor was announced by him at the Akhil Bharatiya 
Pratinidhi Sabha of the RSS held at Nagpur on March 11. 
  What is it that Balasaheb Deoras is suffering from 
which compelled him to choose his successor during his 
lifetime--contrary to the established practice of leaving the 
name of the successor in a sealed envelope that must be opened 
after the sarsanghchalak's death? 
  Deorasji has been suffering from blood pressure and diabetes 
for the past 30 to 35 years. Besides, he underwent a prostate 
operation and had a mild paralytic attack. All these ailments 
made it extremely difficult for him to discharge his duties. 
  What are your views on choosing your successor? 
  I will keep on working so long as I find myself physically 
fit. As far as choosing a successor is concerned, this will be 
finalized during my lifetime. And that is going to be the new 
succession policy in the RSS. Life being what it is, anything 
can happen to anyone anytime. 
  It is alleged that Balasaheb Deoras was a weak-hearted 
leader who wrote eulogistic letters to Indira Gandhi during the 
Emergency to secure his own release from detention. 
  Nothing of that kind happened. Our adversaries had been 
threatening us that they would expose the RSS. 
  All that Deorasji had said in his letter to Indira Gandhi 
was 
that since the Government had made all kinds of investigations 
and could not prove that the RSS was out to overthrow her 
Government, it was time they held talks about nation-building. 
  Many people, particularly the minorities, feel that the 
RSS is a fascist organization that is working to create a "Hindu 
Rashtra" behind the facade of a cultural organization. 
  Those who accuse us of being a fascist organization 
obviously 
know nothing about the origin and growth of fascism in Europe. 
There the ideology of socialism was used to capture political 
power by a political outfit. 
  We are not aspiring to capture political power, to impose 
any 
kind of ideology on the nation. All that we want is that 
national politics should have a pronounced pro-Hindu tilt. We 
are totally against the creation of a theocratic State. India 
has never been a theocratic state and should never be. 
  [23 Mar p 1] 
  [Text] THE STATESMAN: The Sangh Parivar has been 
accused of waging a veritable war on the Muslims. What it has 
done at Ayodhya is now having its reverberations in distant 
Pondicherry and Hubli in Karnataka. 
  Rajendra Singh: Reclamation of the three Hindu 
shrines at Ayodhya, Mathura and Varanasi is the programme of the 
VHP [Vishwa Hindu Parishad (vernacular)] which we support. 
Perhaps they are right in claiming only three Hindu temples in 
lieu of demolition of 3,000 or more of their temples. It would 
have made a qualitative difference in Hindu-Muslim relations had 
the VHP been permitted to construct a Ram temple at Ayodhya. 
  I have no comments on developments in Pondicherry and Hubli. 
  What would be your priorities as RSS chief? 
  I would endeavour to strengthen Hindutva and accelerate the 
tempo of constructive work like slum improvement. During the 
centenary celebrations of K.B. Hedgewar in 1989, the RSS had 
collected about Rs 10 crores from the public. Much of this money 
was channelled into slum-improvement schemes. 
  In Delhi we have been active in this field since 1978: 
currently, nearly 700 slum-improvement programmes are under way 
in the capital. Besides teaching the slum dwellers skills like 
sewing, we try to bring people belonging to scheduled castes and 
tribes into the Hindu mainstream. And our success rate has been 
quite impressive. 
  What is the relationship between the RSS and the BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party]? Is the BJP your political wing? 
  No. The BJP is an independent organization--they take their 
own decisions. It is true that it is a like-minded party; their 
leaders meet us off and on and we discuss many things. But they 
don't take any dictation from us. Nor do we impose anything on 
them. 
  And what is the relationship between the VHP and the 
RSS? Is the VHP a religious wing of the RSS? 
  Again no. The VHP is also an independent organization that 
takes its own independent decisions. Suffice it to say that our 
front organization, including the BJP and VHP, work for a 
"common cause." 
  Has the reported political understanding between the 
BJP and the Shiv Sena your blessings then? 
  Their political understanding has nothing to do with us. 
They 
are free to strengthen it or terminate it. 
  Does the RSS believe in socialism? 
  If socialism means State control, then our answer is that we 
are against it in all walks of life. We want minimum State 
control in the lives of the people. 
  Since the founding of the RSS in 1925 till you took 
over, all its sarsanghchallaks had been Brahmins. Did 
this happen by coincidence or by design? 
  It was a coincidence. Till 1937 the work of the RSS was 
confined mainly to Nagpur. It was in 1937 that Dr Hedgewar sent 
swayamsevaks to Delhi, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Calcutta. 
  In 1940 he died and Guru Golwalker--a Brahmin--took over. In 
1973 Guru Golwalker died and Balasaheb Deoras took over. He too 
was a Brahmin. 
  But let me remind you that between 1925 and 1940, a majority 
of leaders in the Congress, Communist Party, Hindu Mahasabha and 
RSS were Brahmins--Tilak, Pandit Nehru, S.A. Dange, V.D. 
Savarkar and Dr Hedgewar. The exceptions were Mahatma Gandhi and 
Sardar Patel. 
  So it was natural that the leadership went into the hands of 
Brahmins. Today we have a wide variety of leaders belonging to 
various castes.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 28 (UNI)--Prof Rajendra Singh, the 
new Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief has said demands for 
restoration of Hindu places of worship all over the country were 
bound to crop up as long as the "three most sacred places of 
Hindus" are not handed over to them. 
  Referring to the Hindu Munnani's agitation in Pondicherry, 
demanding that a cathedral be handed over to Hindus as it was 
originally a temple, Prof Singh said "Such things are bound to 
happen." 
  He, however, said he was not justifying the Munnani's 
actions 
and added that there were hundreds of institutions and places of 
worship in the country which originally belonged to Hindus. 
  "We had, therefore, said that if you give away the three 
most 
sacred places (Kashi, Mathura and Ayodhya), then the Vishwa 
Hindu Parishad (VHP) would, in all probability, be able to 
mollify the Hindus and tell them not to worry about the other 
places," he said. 
  "If there is delay then some such unforeseen problems would 
crop up. It is the delay which, I think, is responsible for the 
escalation," Prof Singh said in an interview to ORGANISER, the 
RSS mouthpiece. 
  Asked to spell out how he proposed to resolve such problems, 
Prof Singh said, "You can't say. In one place you find that the 
facts are very clear and so strong that the government is trying 
not to do anything." 
  "If you (government) don't satisfy the Hindu society in 
these 
matters, which are of great relevance and importance to us, then 
the question of thousands of mosques standing on Hindu temple 
sites will be raised and there will be nobody to douse the Hindu 
anger," he felt. "Today, the VHP is a formidable body. They can 
say that they have decided to press for the three holiest of 
holy places and that they would not ask for more. This will be 
symbolic," he stressed. 
  "But even if such a symbolic gesture of goodwill is not 
appreciated, then certainly your voice loses the power of 
persuasion. You cannot tell the Hindus to keep quiet. You can't 
tell them not to start new problems," he observed. 
  He accused the government of trying to gag the voice of the 
VHP by banning it. He pointed out that the supreme court had 
decided the case on the Jamaat-e-Islami and not the VHP, though 
both were simultaneously banned. 
  Asked to comment on the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] 
describing Hindutva as its "ideological mascot," the RSS chief 
avoided any direct comment. "It is for them to say what they 
like about their policies. At the same time, how can one forget 
that they (BJP) have opposed GATT and the Dunkel proposals?" he 
asked. 
  On the present Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samajwadi Party 
(SP-BSP) government, he said it was a passing phase, "not a very 
significant phenomenon" and which may not have a lasting effect 
on the nation's political equations. It was difficult to say 
long that government would last, he added. 
  "But the mutual contradictions between them (SP-BSP) and 
their internal dissent are so acute that unless they exercise 
extreme caution, they would not be together for long," he 
predicted. 
  The RSS weekly wanted to know its chief's comments on the 
BSP 
general secretary, Ms Mayawati's statement to "finish off 
Gandhism" and her pitting Gandhiji against Dr Ambedkar. 
  He said the BSP had not vowed to finish Gandhism. "Strangely 
enough, earlier, its leader, Kanshi Ram, had criticised Dr 
Ambedkar. In Maharashtra, he had said Harijans would not make 
any progress unless they denounced Dr Ambedkar," he pointed out. 
  "His (Kanshi Ram's) argument was that whereas he treats the 
Dalits as equal partners, Dr Ambedkar made them beg for their 
rights. In his own style, he tried to belittle Dr Ambedkar. But 
when he realised the tremendous work done by Dr Ambedkar and the 
admiration he commands among the backwards, Kanshi Ram had to 
change his tracks," he added. 
  "Now the same people--Kanshi Ram, Mayawati and company--are 
keen on projecting themselves as followers of Ambedkar. This is 
something new," he noted. 
  The RSS chief alleged that Mr Kanshi Ram had accumulated 
funds which, according to him, confirmed his "foreign, American 
and Christian connections." 
  Prof Singh felt that Dalit politics could never take deep 
roots in Uttar Pradesh as it had in Maharashtra.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 10--In his first rally after being 
appointed the Sarsanghchalak, Singh laid the blame squarely on 
the Government for the demolition of the Babri Masjid at Ayodhya. 
  The chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh [RSS], Mr 
Rajendra Singh, today justified the demolition of the Babri 
Masjid at Ayodhya and exhorted the Muslim leaders of the country 
to hand over the religious sites in Mathura and Varanasi "since 
it is not of the same importance for the Muslims as it is for 
the Hindus." 
  He added that such an action would go a long way in 
restoring 
confidence of the Muslim community in the minds of the Hindus. 
He then went on to say, "We are all sons of the same soil and 
equal in all respects before the eyes of the law." 
  Mr Singh was addressing his first RSS rally after being 
appointed the Sarsanghchalak. He laid the blame squarely on the 
Government for the demolition of the Babri Masjid since, he 
said, it had failed to find a solution to the problem. "No one 
else but the Government is responsible," he told the estimated 
25,000 RSS volunteers, who had gathered at the Ramlia grounds on 
the occasion of the Varsha Pratiprada Utsav, the Hindu New Year 
Day. 
  In his hour-long address, Mr Singh touched on a wide range 
of 
issues. 
  On GATT: He charged the Government with what he 
called sacrificing the interests of the nation by deciding to 
sign the draft of the General Agreements on Tariff and Trade in 
Marrakesh on April 15. 
  He said he wondered why the Government was keen on signing 
the treaty when India's share in the volume of international 
trade was a meagre 0.5 percent. On the contrary, it would be 
more advisable to sign bilateral treaties with trading nations, 
he said, since that would, by itself, raise the share of the 
country in world trade. 
  He said that the Government was going ahead with its 
decision 
to sign the treaty when the external debt of the country was a 
staggering Rs 240,000 [rupees] crores as compared to Rs 17,000 
crores in 1980. 
  On Kashmir: Criticizing the recent moves by the 
Government to initiate the democratic process in Jammu and 
Kashmir, Mr Singh said that the Centre's efforts would be futile 
since the militants continued to hold sway in the Valley. 
  On the N-issue: Regarding the question whether 
India should go nuclear, Mr Singh said that possessing nuclear 
weapons did not mean that India would launch a nuclear attack on 
any country. 
  On politics: Without naming the Congress(I), he 
charged it with breaking up the Telugu Desam Party and the 
Janata Dal(A) to ensure that it secured a majority on the floor 
of the House. Speaking about corruption, he said that the 
Government was, itself, not setting a good example for the 
people to follow. "Otherwise, how could a minority Government 
attain a majority?" he said. 
  Also present at the rally, were Ministers in the Delhi 
Government, Mr Sahib Singh Verma, Mr Lal Behari Tiwari, Mr 
Jagdish Mukhi, and leaders of the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], 
Mr Vijay Kumar Malhotra and Mr Kedar Nath Sahni.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 4 (PTI)--The Congress-I Working 
Committee [CWC] on Monday adopted an action plan to face the 
November Assembly elections in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Goa 
and Sikkim. 
  Under the action plan, party-oriented election campaign will 
be launched from August first and multi-channel assessment 
system introduced for selection of candidates for the polls. 
  District and Pradesh Congress-I Committee Presidents will 
not 
be given tickets to contest the elections and instead they will 
be asked to concentrate on campaign, the party spokesman, Mr 
V.N. Gadjil, told newsmen after a three-hour crucial meeting of 
the CWC. 
  The working committee decided that bodies of Pradesh 
Congress-I Committees and the AICC [All-India Congress 
Committee] would continue as no organisational elections could 
be held this year. 
  As regards the executive bodies at different levels, after 
the expiry of the term in April/May this year, they may also be 
continued but may be reconstituted by the party President, Mr 
P.V. Narasimha Rao, wherever necessary, in order to make them 
more effective. 
  The CWC took strong exception to the anti-party activities 
by 
some members in the last Assembly elections and decided to 
initiate disciplinary action against them. 
  Asked to identify those facing action, Mr Gadgil said that 
they were mostly DCC [District Congress Committee] presidents 
and clarified that no PCC [Pradesh Congress Committee] President 
was involved. 
  Apart from elections scheduled in the four States, the 
Congress-I ruled States of Maharashtra and Gujarat and the 
Janata Dal-ruled Bihar may also opt for an early poll. 
  The CWC also discussed the Dunkel draft and decided to 
launch 
a campaign to blunt the onslaught of the Opposition, which, it 
felt was misleading the people on the issue. 
  Though the present term of the Congress-I Committee at all 
levels comes to an end in April/May this year, the CWC will 
remain unaffected, Mr Gadgil said. 
  Explaining other provisions of the action plan, Mr Gadgil 
said that it sought appropriate representation to women, 
minorities, scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and backward 
classes in all Congress-I committees. 
  It provides for appointment of spokespersons for all the 
PCCs 
and launching of membership drive fort-night in June and July. 
  Frontal organisation and party cells should be allowed to 
conduct their own membership drive and multi-channel assessment 
system should be introduced for selection of candidates.

  [Excerpts] Hyderabad, March 20--The Bharatiya Janata Party 
[BJP] will begin preparations for the forthcoming elections in 
10 States on Monday, when the party's National Executive will 
discuss the poll strategy at length. 
  Briefing newsmen about the deliberations of the first 
session 
of the Executive meeting here on Sunday [20 March], the party 
general secretary and spokesman, Mr Krishan Lal Sharma, said the 
party's Central Election Committee will hold a meeting on Monday 
morning to chalk out the programme. [passage omitted] 
  Mr Sharma said the main issue on the first day's agenda was 
the economic scenario in the country, including the Dunkel's 
proposals and the post-budget situation and its fall-out. He 
said the Executive would come out with a resolution in this 
regard. To a question, he said the party would hold a massive 
rally against the Dunkel proposals in New Delhi on April 6 and 
the Executive would discuss the preparations for the rally. 
Though the party had held several dharnas and rallies in 
different States, this rally would be its first major programme 
at the national level. The rally would prevail upon the Centre 
not to sign the Dunkel draft as it would be detrimental to the 
farming community, he said and added that the party would decide 
the future course of action after April 6. 
  Replying to a volley of questions on the issue, Mr Sharma 
said the party would wait for the outcome of the March 29-30 
special session of the Lok Sabha before taking an official stand 
as to whether it would demand the withdrawal of India from the 
General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT). He denied the 
reports that there was confusion within the party over India 
signing the multi-lateral trade treaty. "What was the need for 
the government to take such a hasty decision to sign the 
agreement. It should have discussed the issue with the 
Opposition," he opined. 
  He said the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] would not approach 
other Opposition parties to launch a common struggle against the 
Dunkel proposals. "We cannot take the initiative in this regard 
as all other opposition parties are against us. If any of them 
invites us to share the platform, we will accept it. But 
unfortunately, there is no indication at all about a united 
action programme against Dunkel among themselves," he said. 
  To a question, Mr Sharma said Ayodhya remains top on the 
party agenda. The issue has brought in polarisation of political 
forces in the country between secularists and 
pseudo-secularists. It had given the BJP a break in the 
political scene, he said. However, the issue was not discussed 
at the present Executive meeting, he added. 
  The BJP National Executive meet began in the morning with 
the welcome address by the State unit president, Mr V. Rama Rao, 
which was followed by felicitation to the veteran leader, Mr 
Atal Behari Vajpayee, for his achievement in thwarting the 
attempts of Pakistan in raising Kashmir issue at the United 
Nations Commission on Human Rights at Geneva recently. Later, 
the party president, Mr L.K. Advani, delivered the inaugural 
address. The Executive adopted the resolutions and other issues 
on the agenda to be discussed during the three-day meet. 
  Later, the former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mr Kalyan 
Singh, presented a report on the deteriorating law and order 
situation in his State during the last 100 days of Mulayam Singh 
Yadav's rule. He told newsmen that as many as 65,000 crimes were 
committed during this period, which included 2,259 murders, 
1,050 kidnappings, 2,000 robberies, 565 dacoities and 49 rape 
cases.

  [Text] Hyderabad, March 20--The Bharatiya Janata Party 
President, Mr L.K. Advani, has asserted that Hindutva is the 
party's `ideological mascot'--the most distinctive feature of 
its identity and approach--and not a mere slogan. 
  In his opening remarks at the three-day National Executive 
meeting of the party which began here on Sunday, Mr Advani said 
Hindutva had been the hallmark of the party well before Ayodhya 
and would continue to be so "even after a magnificent Ram temple 
at the birth place of Rama becomes a fact of life." 
  He said the BJP believed that Indian secularism had its 
roots 
in Hindutva and the nation was secular because it was 
essentially Hindu. Theocracy was alien to Hindu tradition and 
history, he said. 
  Referring to the comments of the party's detractors on the 
`retreat of Hindutva' in the wake of the recent defeat of the 
party in the Assembly elections in the north, Mr Advani said 
that though the results had not measured up to the expectations 
of the party, they were in no way a setback to the party's 
ideology. 
  Mr Advani said for nearly four decades of Indian 
independence, Indian politics had been dominated by one single 
party--the Congress and all the elections were a combat between 
the Congress camp and non-Congress camp. In other words, 
elections were essentially a power struggle between the 
political haves and have-nots. Ideology was irrelevant to the 
confrontation. 
  "But the Ayodhya movement has changed all this. It has 
precipitated a national debate on what is the content of Indian 
nationalism and what is the true meaning of secularism as 
conceived by India's Constitution makers," he said. 
  The BJP believed that India was one country and that Indians 
were one people and the basis for this oneness was its age-old 
culture. "This concept of cultural nationalism is Hindutva," he 
asserted. 
  The BJP president said the Ayodhya movement had left such a 
deep impact on the people that even the worst opponents of the 
BJP had been forced to do some rethinking. Anti-BJPism might 
continue to be the great secular consensus but this was tempered 
by a grudging accommodation of Hindu sentiment. None of the 
parties talked any longer about reconstructing the Babri mosque 
at the site, he said. 
  Mr Advani said the politics of minority vote-banks had given 
birth to pseudo-secularism and the party had been carrying on a 
relentless crusade against it. "The Ayodhya movement marks a 
significant break-through in our efforts. The agitation enabled 
us to focus on Hindutva as an effective alternative to 
pseudo-secularism," he added. 
  Mr Advani described the talk about restarting the political 
process in Jammu and Kashmir as meaningless. While the situation 
in the State was so alarming, all that the government was doing 
was making periodical announcements about holding elections and 
restarting the political process. There was a total bankruptcy 
of policy on the domestic front, he said. 
  The first and foremost need was to restore the 
administration 
and curb insurgency in the valley with a firm hand, he said and 
suggested that if Pakistan's proxy war was to be defeated, its 
agencies in the administration must be ruthlessly weeded out. 
  It was a pleasant surprise to the BJP to find the government 
and other parties responding positively to its suggestion that 
Parliament adopt a unanimous resolution to let the international 
community know what was the nation's bottomline on the Kashmir 
issue, he said. 
  The party also took pride in the achievement of the Indian 
delegation led by Mr Vajpayee at the UN Human Rights Commission 
meet at Geneva in defeating Pakistan's bid to malign India, he 
added.

<F P=106> [Article by Stanley Theodore: "BJP Moots Panel To Decide on </F>
Disinvestment"; first paragraph is THE STATESMAN introduction] 
  [Text] Hyderabad, March 21--Meanwhile, the pro-Advani group 
at the BJP executive meeting has thwarted a move to amend the 
party constitution to make the president's term of three years. 
  The Bharatiya Janata Party today demanded that a 
"disinvestment commission" be set up by the Centre to decide on 
the mode and timing of disinvestment of public sector units. 
  The party leader, Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, briefing the Press 
on the second day of the party's national executive meeting 
here, said that this commission should comprise financial 
experts, bankers, share brokers, trade union leaders, investors 
and Government nominees. 
  He said that though this step would lead to privatization, 
it 
had to be related to the exit policy. He said that the aims of 
disinvestment should be made clear. 
  The BJP today released a statement calling for a total 
rejection of the GATT proposals. Mr Joshi said that India can 
get out of GATT and cited China as an example. 
  While adopting a resolution on the Union Budget, the BJP 
demanded the following: 

  -  A ceiling on borrowings--both internal and 
external--through a legislation under Article 195 of the 
Constitution. 
  -  "Preferential treatment" given to multinationals 
vis-a-vis domestic industries be stopped. 
  -  A complete ban on 
entry of multinationals into the consumer goods sector. 
  -  The 
proceeds from the dis-investment in PSUs [public sector units] 
be used exclusively for retiring national debt so that the 
interest liability could be reduced. 

  Agencies report: Meanwhile, the pro-Advani group in the 
party 
has succeeded in thwarting the move to amend the party 
constitution to make the party president's term of three years 
instead of the existing two consecutive terms of two years each. 
  This amendment had been proposed by the S.S. Bhandari 
committee and has been the subject of heated debate in the party. 
  This and other amendments were circulated among the BJP 
leaders late last night, and were to be discussed today. But 
later, this amendment was deleted. 
  Nuclear deterrant: The party president, Mr L.K. 
Advani, today said that India had "no option but to develop a 
nuclear deterrant in view of the hostile attitude of its 
neighbours." 
  He told reporters here that Pakistan had been claiming that 
it possessed nuclear weapons and recent newspaper reports in the 
United States had only confirmed this. He added that with the 
United States deciding to supply F-16 fighter aircraft to 
Pakistan, the arms race in the sub-continent would escalate 
further. He added that Pakistan was not likely to go in for a 
"hot war" with India since it would not get much mileage out of 
it. 
  Pakistan's decision to close down its consulate in Bombay, 
Mr 
Advani said, was prompted by its setback at the human rights 
meeting in Geneva recently. 
  Kashmir issue: Mr Advani said that the victory at 
Geneva had not brought the country "an inch closer" to finding a 
solution to the Kashmir problem. He added: "Anyone can 
appreciate that the jawans cannot win a war with their hands 
tied behind their backs, as it exists now." 
  Alliance: Asked if the BJP would sound the 
All-India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam for an alliance in Tamil 
Nadu, Mr Advani said elections in 10 States this year would be 
discussed at the party meeting later today. All the party units 
in these States had been asked to concentrate on building up the 
party and not think of alliances, he said.

<F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] Hyderabad, March 22 (UNI)--The National Executive of 
the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday asked the Union 
Government to treat Pakistan as a terrorist State and warned 
that its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which was the "real 
super-government of Pakistan," was now concentrating on south 
India after having spread its tentacles to the North-East. 
  In its resolution on the "Threat to national security," 
released at the concluding day of its three-day session here, 
the Executive cautioned that Hyderabad, Bangalore, Cochin, 
Kozhikode, Bhatkal and Gulbarga in the south had currently 
become major centres of ISI subversive activities. 
  Pointing out that six tonnes of the deadly RDX 
[Cyclotrimethylene Trinitramine] explosive was seized in 
Coimbatore, the Executive said "at this rate, Pakistan could 
land a tonne even of fissionable material to let off a nuclear 
explosion on our soil. It alleged that the ISI had a nexus with 
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Tamil Nadu, with 
the small fishing village of Kyalapatinam serving as the `nerve 
centre.' There were reports that mysterious STD [Subscriber 
Trunk Dialing (telephone)] calls, whose bill came up to Rs one 
lakh in the day, it said. Expressing concern at the increasing 
subversive activities of the ISI in Kerala, the Executive 
charged the Chief Minister, Mr K. Karunakaran, and the main 
Opposition (CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist]) with 
soft-pedalling on the issue. 
  The Executive criticised the Union Government for its 
`inaction' for protecting criminals and for its failure to 
punish even one conspirator in the Bombay and Delhi bomb blasts 
it also charged the ruling CPI-M Government in West Bengal with 
protecting the man behind the Calcutta explosion and the main 
Opposition Telugu Desam and the Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Musleemeen 
(MIM) in Andhra Pradesh with protecting anti-national elements 
for electoral reasons. 
  In an overview of the security threat, the executive pointed 
out that the ISI activities continued uninterrupted despite 
changes in the government. They set Punjab on fire, but normalcy 
was fast returning in the border State. However, it was not so 
in Jammu and Kashmir, it bemoaned. 
  "Specifically, Pakistan is behaving like a terrorist State 
and we should treat it as such, and not deal with it as if 
everything is normal." The ISI, with its local agents and 
foreign patrons, was today the principal subversive in India. 
"What, however, is extremely disturbing is the wholly 
condemnable inaction of the Union Government in the face of 
ISI's deliberate and continued acts of subversions," it said. 
  Calling upon the Union Government to shed its weakness of 
will, give up its defensive postures and take effective steps, 
the meeting said the menacing threats to national security could 
not be met with `kid gloves.' The Executive said 15 million 
Bangladeshis had spread themselves far and wide in India and 
lakhs of Pakistanis visiting India on tourist visas never went 
back. The situation in Hyderabad was "explosive" with 20,000 
Pakistanis living illegally in the city, it added. 
  Alleging that the Hizbul Mujahideen, a Pakistan-based 
militant wing operating in Kashmir, was "thick as thieves" with 
the MIM in Andhra Pradesh, the resolution said unemployed youths 
were being recruited for training in subversion and sabotage. 
Already, three Sangh Pariwar men had lost their lives at the 
hands of these anti-national elements, it said. 
  The National Executive noted with "extreme concern" the 
lists 
of subversive acts in Kerala. 
  Mysterious land deals amounting to crores of rupees "even by 
indigent persons," have been reported from Kozhikode and the 
Kozhikode airport of Karipur, which is in Mallapuram district, 
had become a "hot bed" of ISI activity. Even the government had 
"admitted" sighting unidentified vessels off the Kerala coast 
near Tirur in Mallapuram. 
  On the disappearance of Chekannur Moulvi who had raised his 
voice against communalism and fundamentalism, the resolution 
said he was abducted months ago and was presumed to be dead. But 
the government did not hand over the case to the CBI [Central 
Bureau of Investigation] inspite of Moulvi's wife's appeal. 
  The Executive expressed amazement at the Kerala Chief 
Minister, Mr Karunakaran, contradicting the Union Home 
Minister's statement the very next day after Mr Chavan had 
admitted in Thiruvananthapuram in the first week of February 
last that ISI was active in Kerala and the Union Government was 
aware of it. 
  Mr Karunakaran, just to save his coalition with Muslim 
League, came out with the statement and the CPI-M, the main 
opposition party maintained a "guilty silence" on the matter 
with "hopes of capturing the communal vote bank," it alleged. 
  On the Andhra Pradesh issue, the National Executive 
suggested 
constitution of a high-level body like the special investigation 
team (SIT) with Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) assistance 
to look into the anti-national and ISI operations in the State. 
It suggested taking into custody of communal outfits having 
interlinks with Pakistan and a careful watch on passengers from 
Kashmir, Nepal and Bangladesh.

  [Text] Hyderabad, April 13--The CPI(M)'s [Communist Party 
of India-Marxist] primary aim was to unite all the Left parties 
not only for the forthcoming elections but also to fight the 
Congress(I), according to the party general secretary, Mr 
Harikishen Singh Surjeet. 
  He was briefing the Press on the second day of the party's 
Central Committee deliberations at the Sundarayya Bhavan today. 
  He said that by Left unity he did not mean Communist unity 
only and added that the united actions of the Left parties on 
the Centre's economic policies had evoked good public response. 
  Mr Surjeet said that his party did not object to criticism 
but stated that opposition would put unity at stake. 
  He said that there was no question of joining the BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party] on the economic policies as their 
leader, Mr K.L. Advani, had stated in Parliament that the 
Congress(I) Government was pursuing their economic agenda. 
  Thoug the BJP was opposing these policies under some 
pressure, Mr Surjeet said, as they have not bothered to denounce 
their earlier stand. Joining hands with the BJP would pose a 
threat to national unity, he said. 
  Mr Surjeet said that the central committee also held 
discussions regarding the forthcoming elections to certain 
Assemblies. He said the party had not shifted from its earlier 
stance of fighting the Congress(I) and the BJP. 
  He, however, said that there were some objections from 
certain State units regarding alliances and seat adjustments. 
"There are some policies these Governments (Bihar and Orissa) 
are following we consider are anti-people and need to be sorted 
out," he said. 
  Mr Surjeet said that if the Opposition united in Karnataka 
the Congress(I) could be defeated. 
  Earlier, the central committee of the CPI(M) adopted two 
resolutions. One was to welcome the Supreme Court verdict, which 
asserted that secularism was a basic feature of the Constitution 
and that religion must not be mixed with politics. The party 
called for a parliamentary legislation to be enforced towards 
this end. 
  Another resolution was adopted by the party, paying homage 
to 
those killed in the Jallianwalla Bagh incident on its 75th 
anniversary.

  [Text] Alapuzha, March 18 (PTI)--The expelled Communist 
Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) leader and legislator, Gowri, on 
Friday formally launched a new political party--Janadhipathya 
Samrakshana Samithi (JSS)--formed to "fight political 
corruption." 
  Inaugurating a JSS convention here, she said the new party 
had adopted a red flag with three white stars as its official 
ensign. 
  The JSS, she said, was receiving all-out support from the 
people because of their frustration and agony due to the 
prevailing degeneration of moral values among political parties 
in Kerala and the rampant corruption among political leaders and 
officialdom. 
  Referring to the Dunkel proposals and the new economic 
policy 
of the Centre, she said these issues marked the establishment of 
a new "East India Company" in the country. She, however, said 
this was her personal opinion and the party's official 
assessment would be made known only after a detailed study of 
the Dunkel proposals. 
  The three-day convention is being attended by over 700 
delegates from all over the State besides a large number of Mrs 
Gowri's supporters.

<F P=106> [Article by P.K. Surendran: "Gowri's Party Riding on Crest </F>
of Popularity"] 
  [Text] Thiruvananthapuram, March 22--The new party, 
Janadhipatya Samrakshana Samiti (JSS), launched by the expelled 
Marxist veteran, Mrs K.R. Gowri on Sunday brings in a whiff of 
fresh air in the caste and communally polluted politics of 
Kerala. 
  Mrs Gowri had earlier steadfastedly refused the company of 
many backward castes-minority groups masquerading as political 
parties in the contemporary political scene here. 
  Her rebuff to Mr Kanshi Ram of the BSP [Bahujan Samaj Party] 
and the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP) of the 
Ezhavas (OBC [other backward classes]) has obviously 
disappointed them. 
  Mr Ram who came to meet her with high hopes had his ego 
greatly deflated when the Marxist woman enlightened him on the 
need to help all poor people whichever caste or community they 
might belong to. 
  The first show of strength the JSS displayed at Alapuzha, a 
coastal town in South Kerala too was impressive. Considering 
that Mrs Gowri founded a party single handedly within two months 
of her expulsion from the CPM, the maiden show was attractive. 
  The party constitution provides for grassroots democracy 
with 
freedom to express one's opinion freely is provided for. The 
party has given to itself the task of pursuing Communist 
ideologies in the demo set up with sincerity. Thrust of the new 
party policy is purging the politics of corruption. 
  However, the crucial question that bothers political 
observers is whether the JSS will grow roots in the tangled 
power politics of Kerala where every caste and community has 
formed a political party of its own. 
  Mrs Gowri's clarion call to create a new clean political 
party sounds more like the Communist utopia of the state power 
withering away gradually. 
  After all, JSS is the 302d political party of the state 
though hardly 12 of them have representation in the state 
assembly. More importantly, where will the finance to fight 
elections come from? 
  The charge that the JSS will end up as another appendage to 
the Congress soon cannot be dismissed as CPM-spawned slur 
campaign. Witnesses to the three-day convention of the JSS at 
Alapuzha last week would not have failed to notice the absence 
of criticism of the Congress for various ills the country faced. 
  There was on the other hand a pathetic tinge to the 
CPM-phobia the new party evinced in deciding every major policy 
of the party. 
  The overriding passion was to ensure that the JSS stand 
looked diametrically opposite to the CPM stand on major issues. 
  Again, a sizeable number of the delegates at the convention, 
appeared to have been a one-time Marxist workers or leaders. 
This, say JSS leaders, cannot be helped. Every party will have 
some grumblers, gamblers and glam persons. 
  Which is the major constituency of the new party? The JSS 
would surely claim a part of the CPM cadres belonging to the 
backward castes. But its prospects of winning over 
minorities--Christians and Muslims--are rather dim. Christian 
community accounting for nearly 25 per cent of the population 
has the Congress(I) and the KLA [expansion not given] Congress 
wooing them. While the Muslim League, its rival party being 
floated by Mr Ibrahim Sulaiman Sait and the PDP [expansion not 
given] of Mr Abdul Nasser Madani are all vying for another 20 
per cent of the population. Therefore JSS will find it extremely 
hard to get new converts to the JSS especially in the north 
Kerala. 
  Mrs Gowri's refusal to comment on the controversial 
palmolein 
deal in which the chief minister, Mr K. Karunakaran, finds 
himself on a cleft-stick too has engendered the belief that the 
JSS is leaning heavily on the Congress for its survival. 
  It was in this context that the reason [as published] 
mischievious comment of Mr Karunakaran that his party would give 
Mrs Gowri the high position if she chooses to join the Congress 
is to be viewed. His aims seem to have been two folded: having 
helped Mrs Gowri to move away from the CPM he now wants to 
besmire her spotless political image so that she and her party 
would end up in the UDF [United Democratic Front] camp 
eventually. 
  A tacit seat understanding with the Congress for the 
forthcoming panchayat/municipal elections is already being 
talked about in the political camps.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 12--The Indian Union Muslim League 
[IUML] leader, Mr Ebrahim Sulaiman Sait, resigned from the party 
today, a day after announcing his decision to launch a new 
secular outfit next week, reports PTI. 
  In a statement here, Mr Sait, who is a member of Parliament, 
alleged that the ideals and objectives of the IUML were being 
forsaken for "petty gains." 
  Mr Sait said he was deeply grieved that neither the party 
leadership in Kerala nor its national leadership had exhibited 
any inclination to change its policy of clinging to power in a 
most "humiliating manner," totally sacrificing the interests of 
the community. 
  He criticized the IUML leadership for refusing to pull out 
of 
the Congress(I)-led United Democratic Front Government in 
Kerala, alleging that they were "blindly supporting" the 
Congress(I) line however "disgraceful and detrimental" it might 
be. 
  Stating that he was resigning with a "heavy heart," Mr Sait 
said the recent support extended by the party's leadership in 
Kerala to the single-point reference to the Supreme Court under 
Article 143 of the Constitution on the Ayodhya issue had damaged 
the feelings of all Muslims and secular forces beyond repair. 
  He pointed out he had resolved to launch a new party after 
extensive consultations with various Muslim organizations, both 
political and non-political, including past and present leaders 
of the IUML. 
  Mr Sait said he had convened an all-India political 
convention to be attended by over 500 delegates here on April 23 
to decide on the name, structure and flag of the new party which 
would be "well-knit, well coordinated, broadbased and secular."

  [Text] New Delhi, April 11 (PTI)--Mr Ebrahim Sulaiman Sait, 
the ousted president of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), 
today announced that he would launch a new party here on April 
23. 
  Mr Sait told a press conference that it was finally resolved 
to launch a new party, after extensive consultations with 
various Muslim organisations, both political and non-political, 
including past and present leaders of the IUML and even the 
Jamait-i-Islami. 
  Mr Sait said he had convened an all-India political 
convention to be attended by over 500 delegates here on April 23 
to decide on the name, structure and flag of the new party which 
would be "well-knit, coordinated, broadbased and secular." 
  Mr Sait's faction had split from the IUML after he was 
ousted 
as president of the party he led for 21 years and was replaced 
by Mr G.M. Banatwala. Mr Said today reiterated his charges that 
the elections of the president were "sudden, not on the agenda 
and manipulated." 
  Mr Sait said he was "pained and anguished" to announce this 
departure from the IUML, but it was inevitable because the 
Kerala unit of the IUML refused to quit the Congress-led 
government. 
  The Sait faction had been pressing its Kerala unit to quit 
the Karunakaran government after the demolition of the Babri 
Masjid, saying there should be no truck with the Congress. 
  All Muslims rejected the Central government's package 
following the demolition of the Babri Masjid, namely acquisition 
of the disputed land, reference to the supreme court by the 
President and the formation of two trusts to build a temple and 
mosque each, Mr Sait said. 
  The Kerala unit of the IUML was supporting this package and 
toeing the government line and their "action is sheer political 
dishonesty and hypocricy" which has led to the party's complete 
"alienation, especially among the youth," Mr Sait claimed. 
  Before launching the new party, a 25-member high powered 
committee would hold two days of meetings to deliberate over the 
name, modalities and structure of the new party and make its 
recommendations for the approval of the session. 
  The convention has been sponsored by 75 leading 
personalities 
of the Muslim community from different states who will decide 
about the theme and conduct of the convention, he said. 
  Mr Mohammad Sulaiman, former president of the Uttar Pradesh 
state Muslim League, Dr Bashir Khan Ahmed, former office-bearer 
of the Delhi unit, and Mr Mansoor Ahmed Khan of the Delhi unit, 
also attended the press conference along with Mr Sait. 
  Mr Sait said he held two consultative meets with Muslim 
leaders of the northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya 
Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan on March 6 in Delhi and another one 
in Madras with representatives and leaders of Muslim 
organisations of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and 
Lakhswadeep Islands. 
  In a statement read out at the press conference, Mr Sait 
said, "Such a step (of forming a new party) became inevitable 
because of sheer power-mongering, regardless of the interests of 
the community." 
  "A coterie which was controlling the Kerala unit of the IUML 
was sacrificing all principles of truth and justice and was 
blindly following Congress culture and the Congress line," he 
said. 
  It was a tragedy that even the national leadership of the 
IUML had fallen prey to the "misguided and detrimental policy of 
toeing totally the line of the Kerala state Muslim League," he 
added. 
  Mr Sait said that he had given the Kerala unit two months 
time to withdraw from the United Democratic Front (UDF) 
government and as that time had expired, he was announcing the 
launch of a new party. 
  He, however, ruled out resigning from the IUML or his Lok 
Sabha seat forthwith. He said mass resignations from the party 
would come by and by, and said he would not quit his Lok Sabha 
seat "because my constituents do not want me to."

  [Text] New Delhi, March 23 (PTI)--India would have to stand 
firm to counter the growing pressure from some countries using 
"human rights" as a front, as this was indirectly aiding 
Pakistan in destabilising the country, the defense ministry has 
said in its annual report. 
  Calling for a complete reassessment of threat perceptions, 
to 
the country's security in the context of the unipolar world and 
the present unsettled international order, the report says that 
India would have to stand "firm to counter the pressures which 
may be sought to be placed on us." 
  Asserting that a new dimension to the militancy problem had 
been added by the induction of foreign mercenaries with 
sophisticated weapons into Jammu and Kashmir, the report said 
that this had added to the terrorist depredations in the Valley. 
  India, the report said was facing a "dark conspiracy" as the 
spurt in the level of militancy from across the border was being 
timed with raising the bogey of violations of human rights in 
international forums to put maximum pressure on the country. 
  The report has revealed that Pakistan has been using the 
territory of some neighbouring countries to infiltrate trained 
militants, arms and ammunition and explosives into India. 
  The report says that Pakistani governmental and 
non-governmental agencies had extended their anti-India campaign 
and were encouraging several anti-India groups within the 
country to work as new channels for the clandestine inflow of 
arms. 
  The report said these groups were also being used to 
engineer 
communal violence like bomb blasts and other acts of arson and 
sabotage. 
  While, India was taking measures to decimate the threat of 
militants, the country was also facing indirect international 
pressure in the shape of increased restraints being imposed by 
industrially advanced nations on transfer of defence technology. 
  This, the report said was proving to be a major constraint 
on 
defence self reliance and thus called for a greater outlay on 
research and development in the coming years. 
  Taking note of the increasing defence spending of Pakistan 
and its move to acquire highly sophisticated weapons which go 
far beyond its legitimate needs, the report said this was 
coupled with Pakistan's acquisition of the new M-11 missile 
system from China and the greater defence co-operation between 
the two countries. 
  Along with this, the report says India also needed to take 
note of reported proliferation of missiles in Saudi Arabia and 
Iran. It also says that China has embarked upon an ambitious 
programme of modernisation of its armed forces and had purchased 
state of the art fighter aircraft from Russia. 
  All these developments, the report said would compel India 
to 
adopt prudent measures to ensure its own security through a 
stronger defence system. 
  On the Sino-Indian relations, the report says there has been 
a perceptible movement, with the signing of the historic 
agreement to maintain peace and tranquillity on the borders 
between the two countries. Under the agreement, the report says, 
the two sides would strictly respect and observe the line of 
control with neither side over-stepping it.

  [29 Mar 94 p 6] 
  [Text] New Delhi, March 28--A plus point of the Defence 
Ministry's Annual Report is the fairly comprehensive 
appreciation of the global and regional factors which influence 
security perceptions in our country. 
  Besides, the rather large dose of Pakistan-bashing in it is 
bound to be popular. 
  The document, however, is of little constructive 
significance, since it fails to effectively deal with the 
current state of Defence preparedness. Neither does it clear the 
serious apprehensions expressed by those concerned with the 
maintenance of national security. 
  The annual report of each Ministry is published to help 
M.P.'s [Members of Parliament] understand the "ground realities" 
of that particular Ministry. The reports also serve as the basis 
on which the M.P.s make presentations when demands for grants 
are debated in the Lok Sabha. 
  The reports are also useful during discussions on the 
working 
of the Ministries in the Rajya Sabha. The Defence report, 
however, will contribute little or nothing to these ends. 
  For quite some time now, Defence analysts have been 
demanding 
greater transparency on such matters. 
  They realize that a credible security apparatus cannot be 
put 
in place in the absence of informed public opinion, which is 
itself created by a comprehensive national debate. 
  Thus, when senior military personnel leave the galleries at 
the end of the parliamentary debate on the report, they will 
continue to be amazed at the lack of knowledge which most M.P.s 
display. 
  Consider the central issue of Defence expenditure. The 
report 
has three paragraphs dealing with what Pakistan has been 
spending, talks of a nine-fold increase in its Defence Budget 
between '78 and '93--an average annual growth rate of 
approximately 15 percent. 
  Last year, the report says, Defence accounted for 34.6 
percent of Pakistan's spending on the current account. The 
country's Defence expenditure, it adds, amounts to 7.14 percent 
of the Gross Domestic Product (1992 figures) and contrasts it 
with India's 2.75 percent. 
  However, India's Defence expenditure warrants a single 
paragraph and a couple of graphic displays of the major heads of 
spending. 
  While the graphs may reveal something, all that the lone 
paragraph states is that "given India's size and security 
concerns, the outlay on Defence, assessed either as a percentage 
of the total Central Government expenditure or of the GDP, 
continues to be one of the lowest amongst our neighbouring 
countries." 
  If this was intended to be self-congratulatory it has fallen 
flat. Whatever the report may say, it is undeniable that almost 
every Defence specialist has been stressing that in real terms 
the outlays have been falling over the past five years. 
  Also--and, perhaps, more significantly--the text of that 
single paragraph is a word-for-word repetition of what was 
stated in the reports for 1991-92 and 1992-93. 
  Surely, members of Parliament deserve more than that. It 
must 
be remembered that unlike other Ministries or Departments which 
release a fair amount of published information, the [text 
illegible] Defence Ministry can only be gauged from the Annual 
Report and the Budget papers. 
  Even the replies to questions in Parliament are calculatedly 
vague. 
  This "closed shop" attitude permeates the report. It does 
speak of the resource crunch at three or four places--but always 
stresses that there has been no compromise on Defence 
preparedness. 
  This, in a sense, is even worse than saying nothing, for it 
tends to present a misleading picture. 
  Just about every competent analyst has been drawing 
attention 
to the adverse impact of Defence expenditure failing to keep 
abreast of inflation and exchange-rates. The report suggests 
that they are all wide off the mark. 
  [30 Mar 94 p 6] 
  [Text] New Delhi, March 29--A virtue has been made of 
economy in the Annual Report brought out by the Ministry of 
Defence, which is regarded as the prime source of official 
information on the state of defence in the country. 
  There are paragraphs on that point in the chapters on the 
Army and the Air Force. 
  The Navy, however, has been "excepted." One of its officers 
jocularly remarked that it was because its share of the Budget 
was so paltry, in any case, that there was nothing to reduce. 
  While dealing with planning, also, the report talks of the 
endeavour to "balance the inescapable minimum maintenance 
requirements of our defence forces and the need to modernize 
them without unduly straining the national economy." 
  Are the forces worthy only of the "inescapable minimum?" 
  There can be no quarrel with the desire to ensure that each 
rupee goes the farthest possible. But just how serious the 
problem of low outlays has become, was proved by the mid-year 
increase of over Rs 2,200 crores [rupees] during the current 
financial year. 
  The increase was obviously necessitated by the increased 
commitment of the Army on internal security duties, especially 
those in Jammu and Kashmir. 
  The report, however, is silent about what forced this 
additional allocation. The Union Finance Minister, Dr Manmohan 
Singh, offered an insight while countering allegation that he 
had failed to contain deficits. 
  He told the Rajya Sabha: "What has happened in the last few 
months is now well known to this country. 
  "And I would not be worthy of being the Finance Minister if 
I 
were to say: `No, I have an obligation to meet the fiscal 
deficit target. Therefore, I will not meet the legitimate needs 
of India's armed forces in the circumstances of grave danger to 
national security that our country is facing'." 
  Would it not have been better if the Defence Ministry had 
utilized the report to educate M.P.s and the nation at large, 
about that "grave danger to national security?" 
  And did the Finance Minister actually admit that his initial 
outlay for '93-'94 failed to cater to the "legitimate needs" of 
the armed forces? 
  Pakistani involvement in Kashmir--if present at all--could 
not have developed overnight. And if, as the report repeatedly 
asserts, there was no compromise, would the proposed sale of 
F-16's to Pakistan sent so many shivers down political spines? 
  The report pays scant attention to several other important 
issues. There has been so much talk of the need for improving 
the "higher defence organization." 
  But the document suggests that all is well on the planning 
front, at least as far as its mechanisms go. 
  However, while replying to the last Defence debate in the 
Lok 
Sabha, the Prime Minister spoke of reviving the National 
Security Council in a modified form. Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao has 
not fulfilled his promise of "coming back" to the subject in a 
few months. The report, of course, is silent on that score. 
  It can be nobody's case that the Defence Ministry publicly 
quantify the difficulties it faces in carrying out its 
supremely, important task. 
  Not even the most severe of its critics would suggest that 
it 
parts with information that has genuine security implications. 
  Yet, if that were to be stretched--as is being done--to 
ensure that the nation remained ignorant of reality it would 
ultimately prove counter-productive. If all is well as far as 
our security considerations are concerned, as the report tends 
to indicate, then why has the Government spent Rs 23,000 crores 
on Defence? 
  Perhaps it would be an exaggeration to conclude that the 
report says little because virtually nothing is being done to 
restructure the military machine.

  [Text] Bombay, March 30--Dr Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan, 54, 
at present director of the satellite centre of the Indian Space 
Research Organisation (ISRO) at Bangalore, will take over 
tomorrow from Professor U.R. Rao as chairman of ISRO. 
  Prof Rao, who spared no efforts to help India attain 
self-reliance in the critical area of space technology, will lay 
down office after 25 years with ISRO. He became the chairman in 
October 1984. 
  Dr Kasturirangan is expected to move into his new position 
in 
a manner befitting the space age when he will address all 
employees in various ISRO establishments throughout the country 
through the INSAT satellite tomorrow afternoon. 
  Born in 1940 at Ernakulam, Dr Kasturirangan, an extremely 
soft-spoken and brilliant aerospace scientist, obtained his 
doctorate in experimental high energy astronomy in 1971 from 
Gujarat University, working at the National Physical Research 
Laboratory. 
  Dr Kasturirangan was the project director of India's first 
two experimental earth observation satellites, `Bhaskara' I and 
II. Subsequently, as project director of the Indian Remote 
Sensing satellite (IRS-IA), he directed its design, development 
and operation. 
  As director of the satellite centre, he oversaw the 
development of the second generation of Indian National 
Satellite (INSAT-2), the first two of which, INSAT-2A and 
INSAT-2B, were successfully launched in July 1992 and July 1993 
respectively. 
  Dr Kasturirangan is a fellow of the Indian National Science 
Academy, the Astronautical Society of India and a member of the 
International Astronomical Union and the International Academy 
of Astronautics. He is also a member of the International 
Academy of Astronautics' sub-committee on Mars exploration. 
  Among the several awards he has won are the "Shri Hari Om 
Ashram Prerit Dr Vikram Sarabhai Award" for systems analysis and 
management (1981), the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award for 
engineering sciences (1983), the Shri Om Prakash Bhasin 
Foundation Award for space and aerospace (1988) and the award of 
the Institution of Engineers (India), Karnataka (1992). 
  Dr Kasturirangan was conferred the Padma Shri in 1982 and 
the 
Padma Bhushan in 1992, by the government of India.

  [Text] Bombay, April 15--The government of India's 
department of space is now fully capable of making India a major 
space power by the turn of the century. "India is determined to 
forge ahead by enhancing and sustaining the space services 
overcoming any external pressure that may come in the way. And, 
the department of space has become, over the years, a dynamic 
and vibrant organisation, fully capable of making India a major 
space power by the turn of the century," says the just-released 
annual report (1993-94) of the department of space. 
  According to the report, the country was on the threshold of 
achieving self-reliance in the launch vehicle technology. In the 
process, a strong technical manpower base has been created and a 
research and development infrastructure built up. 
  The space department's statement assumes significance in 
view 
of the recent remarks made by Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in an 
interview to INDIA TODAY that restrictions imposed by the 
missile technology control regime (MTCR) will in no way affect 
the country's space programmes while referring to the nation's 
missile projects. 
  Dr Kalam, often described as the father of India's rocket 
programmes and now tipped to take over as the vice chancellor of 
Madras University, said that the country was 90 per cent 
self-sufficient in the aerospace field. 
  The space department's report has stated that the close 
space-industry partnership among the public, private and joint 
sectors has enabled Indian industry to meet the production 
demands for space products and services in a timely and cost 
effective way. 
  Touching on some of the other projects, the report said as 
of 
October 1, 1993, a total of 142 telecommunications terminals 
were operating in the INSAT (Indian National Satellite System) 
telecommunication network providing 4,056 two-way speech 
circuits. 
  Over 400 additional earth stations, including 50 for 
satellite-based rural telegraphy network pilot project in the 
north-eastern region were now under various stages of 
implementation in the department of telecommunication's network, 
the report said. 
  Under the INSAT scheme, 2,000 direct reception sets have 
been 
deployed in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, 
Maharashtra and Gujarat for the benefit of the local community.

<F P=106> [Article by Amrita Nair-Ghaswalla: "Firm Develops Battery </F>
for Russian Sub"] 
  [Text] Bombay, April 13--Standard Batteries Limited (SBL), 
an associate member of the diversified Williamson Magor group, 
has signed a protocol agreement with the Central Bureau of 
Design (Rubin) Leningrad, wherein Rubin has accepted SBL's 
newly-developed battery for the Foxtrot class submarine, a 
Russian sub. 
  A Rubin delegation is slated to visit the company's plant 
and 
witness the manufacturing capacities in mid-May, to further 
their interest in the battery, it is reliably learnt. Once the 
company receives the stamp of approval from Rubin, the battery 
will be offered to the erstwhile Russian states as well as 16 
other countries which use Russian submarines. 
  SBL has been supplying Foxtrot submarine batteries to the 
Indian navy since 1975. The Indian navy has seven such subs at 
present in its naval fleet. The inclusion of the modified 
battery by the Indian navy is expected to save forex to the tune 
of Rs 200 crores [rupees], during the lifetime of the submarine, 
according to Mr P.R. Natarajan, vice-president, SBL group 
associate. 
  The prototype of the battery has been developed by SBL in 
its 
own development wing and Indian naval officials are scheduled to 
witness its workability, Mr Natarajan added. The company has a 
technical collaboration with Hagen Batteries AG of Germany for 
its submarine batteries. 
  The new battery is lighter in weight, has a higher energy 
density, less maintenance and a longer usage capability. Each 
battery has 240 cells in it, each weighing 800 kg. 
  The Indian navy has 15 subs of Russian origin in its 
fleet--seven Foxtrot's and eight Kilo submarines. Though SBL has 
been supplying batteries for both the Foxtrot and Kilo 
submarines, India has been importing batteries at a cost of Rs 8 
crores per battery. The new technology devised for the Foxtrot 
battery is expected to cut down on this cost. 
  Moreover, instead of phasing out the country's 20-year-old 
Foxtrot submarines, since most have exceeded their life span, 
the Indian navy is refitting its submarines due to the 
constraints of buying a new one at a cost of Rs 300-400 crores. 
The new SBL battery is also aimed at cutting down this cost. 
  SBL recently exported a submarine battery comprising 240 
cells to Algeria at a cost of around Rs 10 crores. It has also 
received repeat orders for Kilo submarine batteries from 
Algeria. 
  Meanwhile, industrial relations at the SBL signing of a new 
5-year productivity-linked agreement between the company's 650 
workers and the management. An average hike of Rs 800 has been 
granted to all the employees, who have been asked to increase 
production by 20 per cent. 
  The company continues to pay salaries amounting to Rs 4 
lakhs 
per month, to the 100 workers who have been ordered to remain 
outside the company's premises, following the lock-out over a 
year ago. 
  The company is augmenting its financial requirements through 
a rights issue slated in mid-May. The issue, which is to be 4:1 
at a premium of 10 plus 10, will hike the current equity level 
of Rs 2 crores to Rs 10 crores. Last year's turnover has been 
placed at Rs 120 crores.

<F P=106> [Article by Anita Katyal: "Composition of Rajya Sabha To </F>
Change"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, March 20--When the Rajya Sabha 
re-assemblies here on April 18 after a month-long recess, its 
composition will have undergone a considerable change with a 
large chunk of its 250-odd members having retired and many new 
ones replacing them. 
  Unlike the Lok Sabha where the ruling party has been 
progressively adding to its numbers, in the upper house the 
treasury benches will shrink in size, no longer commanding the 
comfortable position they do at present. 
  From 106, the Congress strength will come down to 95 while 
the main opposition party, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], 
will have added substantially to its numbers, which will go up 
from 33 to 45. Even the Janata Dal, which has been written off 
by political pundits, will increase its presence from 27 to 29. 
  With the Mulayam Singh Yadav-Kanshi Ram combine coming to 
power in U.P., [Uttar Pradesh] their respective parties will be 
better represented now in the Rajya Sabha. While the Samajwadi 
Party's representation will go up from two to five, the Bahujan 
Samaj Party (BSP) will be making its debut in the upper house. 
  Among the losers are the Samajwadi Janata Party (SJP), which 
will be losing three of its 11 members while the TDP [Telugu 
Desam Party] strength will be depleted from five to three. 
  The "shouting brigade" of the Congress will now be poorer by 
one of its most effective members, Mr Vishvajit Prithvijit 
Singh, who was equally capable of solid argument when the 
occasion demanded. It will probably gain from the return of the 
former Bihar chief minister, Dr Jagannath Mishra, who also 
enjoys the reputation of being a voluble parliamentarian. 
  The party's doughty fighter, Mrs Satyabehin, will also not 
be 
returning next month just as Mr M.C. Bhandare, whose legal 
acumen is bound to be missed by the ruling party. 
  The party seniors who will be gracing the treasury benches, 
include Mr V.N. Gadgil, who is coming back to the upper house 
after a gap of 18 years, Mr Janardhan Poojary, Mr Madhavsinh 
Solanki and Mr Jitender Prasad, political secretary to the 
Congress president, who comes to the Rajya Sabha for the first 
time as he has been a member of the other House till now. 
  Mr Solanki's return, of course, is contingent on the ongoing 
leadership battle being waged in Gujarat. Should Mr Solanki 
succeed in "capturing" the chief minister's post he will have to 
vacate his seat in the upper house. 
  Another Congress leader, who is coming back after a gap, is 
Mr Ramji Lal, who had vacated his seat at the party high 
command's behest to make way for Mr Dinesh Singh. Mr Lal has 
been elected from Harayana in place of Mr Mohinder Singh Lather, 
Mr Devi Lal's relation, whose exit means the severing of the 
Tau's last link with this house. 
  Among those who have been reelected are Mr Suresh Kalmadi, 
Ms 
Saroj Kharpade, Mr Sitaram Kesari, Mr Bhuvnesh Chaturvedi and Mr 
Hansraj Bhardwaj, who has managed to survive despite Mr T.N. 
Seshan's efforts to do him out of his seat. 
  The opposition ranks in the Rajya Sabha might have been 
steadily swelling but this increase in numbers has been more 
than offset by the loss of effective speakers like Mr Kamal 
Morarka of the SJP. As the Janata Dal leader, Mr S. Jaipal 
Reddy, rightly put it in his farewell speech, Mr Morarka scaled 
great oratorial heights and was undoubtedly one of the ablest 
parliamentarians, who had the knack of coming to the root of a 
problem without resorting to rhetoric. 
  Mr Morarka's loss will be doubly felt by the opposition as 
it 
had already lost an effective speaker and fighter in Mr Yashwant 
Sinha, who resigned his seat when he snapped ties with the SJP 
and joined the BJP last November. 
  Similarly, the maverick politician, Dr Subramaniam Swamy, 
always a delight to listen to irrespective of whether one agreed 
with his brand of politics, will leave a vacuum which will not 
be easy to fill. His retirement, however, will be quite a relief 
to the AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] members 
at least, considering Dr Swamy's penchant for raising 
uncomfortable questions regarding Tamil Nadu and its chief 
minister. 
  However, the opposition will find itself fortified by the 
fiery presence of the first-timer, Ms Mayawati of the BSP, who 
has already become a controversial figure because of her 
unsavoury remarks about the Father of the Nation. 
  Considering her track record in the Lok Sabha, Ms Mayawati, 
known for her intemperate and colourful language, is set to make 
waves in the upper house. 
  Film star-turned-politician, Mr Raj Babbar, will be taking a 
bow on the country's political stage, having been elected by the 
SP [Superintendent of Police]. 
  Ironically, he will find himself face-to-face with his 
father-in-law, Mr Shivaji Patil (Smita Patil's father).

<F P=106> [Article by Anirban Choudhury: "Crime and Violence Thrive in </F>
Border Villages"] 
  [Text] Malda, April 6--The indiscriminate firing by a BSF 
[Border Security Force] jawan leading to the death of six 
residents of a North Dinajpur village, about 200 km from here, 
has underscored the simmering tension that permeates the border 
districts of West Bengal. 
  Malda, with a 170-km-long border with Bangladesh, is no 
exception. The villages here, dotted along the border--from 
Kaliachawk to Bamangola--survive on smuggling. Some BSF 
personnel serve as catalysts. 
  Local smugglers reportedly thrive under the patronage of the 
panchayats and violence, mostly in connection with 
smuggling-related incidents, erupts at regular intervals. 
  In Malda town itself, out of the estimated 20,000 rickshaw 
drivers, 7,000 are suspected to be Bangladeshis, who cross the 
border each day to make a living. Intelligence officers here 
said that a Bangladeshi has to pay Rs 20 [rupees] to the BSF to 
cross over. Most of them return home but some stay back. 
  The district administration says it is worried at the spate 
of criminal activities along vulnerable points along the border. 
Kumbhira, Mojonpur, Kumarpur, Atradanga, Modipur and 
Muchia-Adampur have been identified as some of the hot-spots. 
  At a BSF border camp near Adampur this morning, a youth was 
seen having a conversation with security personnel. Inquiries 
revealed that he was caught by the police only a week ago with 
smuggled goods. However, he was back in business. Incidentally, 
he was the brother of the panchayat pradhan, a CPI(M) [Communist 
Party of India-Marxist] leader. 
  This isn't a singular case. Today the BSF watch-tower was 
vacant and people freely roamed in the "No Man's Land." Just 
across the Mahananda River, residents of Bholahat of Bangladesh 
were seen bathing. A man crossed the river and proceeded towards 
Bangladesh, wading in the waist-deep water. 
  An elderly resident, apparently scared to identify himself, 
said: "We are used to seeing trucks being parked on the 
riverbank while smuggled goods are being loaded and unloaded." 
  Mr Krishnendu Chowdhury, district Youth Congress(I) 
president, said that there was a system of "Border Dak" in the 
BSF outposts. Under this, the big-league smugglers are allegedly 
required to pay hefty sums to the BSF outposts, which, in turn, 
allow them to operate freely. 
  Cattle smuggling and theft of cattle have posed serious 
threats to the villagers. They allege that the personnel of the 
Bangladesh Rifles, the BSF and smugglers--from both sides of the 
border--have forged alliances of convenience at several points 
along the border. 
  And cattle continues to disappear from Indian villages. 
Besides cattle, rice, sugar, atta and kerosene continue to be 
ferried across the border with impunity. They fetch prices 
double those in Indian markets. And in return, arms, gold and 
electronic goods are despatched to different parts of India 
through various points in Malda. 
  Seen in this context, last Sunday's firing has put the role 
of a section BSF personnel in question. Villagers say that the 
BSF personnel's free mixing with known smugglers, harassing 
village women and extortion from villagers, have brought the 
entire force under a cloud. 
  Local residents say they are too apprehensive to talk to the 
BSF and this has severely affected the organization's 
Intelligence network. Also, the committed personnel are 
incurring the wrath of the villagers.

  [Text] Until the discovery of oil and the reliance on its 
sale, the agriculture sector in Iran was considered one of the 
nation's productive sources of revenue. The makeup of Iran's 
population and its concentration in the rural areas made it 
possible for most of the nation's active manpower to be employed 
in the agriculture sector. However, when the nation became 
inundated with oil, attention to this sector decreased day by 
day. With the implementation of improper policies and the 
adoption of guidelines and policies that were not compatible 
with the ways and traditions of the people of Iran, and with the 
rampant growth of assembly industries, Iran was gradually 
transformed from a producer of agricultural and food projects to 
a major importer of these kinds of crops. 
  In the years prior to the triumph of the Islamic revolution 
the nation's income from the sale of oil was $25 billion per 
year, while Iran's population was 36 million at most. Today 
Iran's population is about to exceed 60 million, yet the foreign 
exchange revenues from the sale of oil are about half what they 
were before the revolution. 
  It appears that it is now vitally necessary to make a change 
in economic structures, especially in the agriculture sector, in 
view of the background that has been sketched. 
  Although during the First Five-Year Plan, with 
implementation 
of the Pivotal Wheat Project, production of this product 
increased, bordering on 11 million tons per year, considerable 
quantities of wheat, rice, cotton, meat (both white and red) and 
even dairy products are still purchased abroad. 
  On the one hand, increased food production meets domestic 
needs and prevents the expenditure of limited foreign exchange 
to import food, and on the other hand, in view of the very high 
added value of many food industries, if the country becomes a 
food exporter a significant amount of foreign exchange will also 
be obtained in this way. 
  On the other hand, the world's food industries are 
considered 
strategic and sensitive. The industrial and imperialist nations 
sometimes use them as pressure levers. The secretary of 
agriculture under President Jimmy Carter stated plainly that 
America's most cutting weapon after military weapons is food and 
agricultural industries and crops. 
  In the second half of the 20th century it has been seen 
numerous times that the West and especially America have made 
practical use of this leverage to advance their goals in the 
world. 
  To become familiar with the problems and issues in the food 
industry, the obstacles to developing conversion industries in 
the agricultural sector and ways to increase the production of 
food for consumption and export in the country, KEYHAN-E HAVA'I 
held separate interviews with several insiders and experts in 
the food industry sciences and industries, the results of which 
you will read below. 
  The major place of the agriculture sector in economic 
development and the gross national product is concealed from no 
one, because even the world's most advanced industrial nations 
have never considered themselves to be without need of growth in 
the agriculture sector. Many economic experts believe that 
self-sufficiency in the production of agricultural crops and 
products is the preliminary to other technological and 
industrial and, in general, economic progress. 
  Likewise, many of the world's economists consider 
agricultural products to be the most realistic kind of product 
because the wheels of production in this sector never stop, due 
to the ease of access to such tools of production as land, solar 
energy, and water. 
  Many of the world's underground resources, ores, and metals 
have a limited life. Their extraction stops after a period of 
time because these mines and resources such as oil, copper, 
iron, aluminum, rock coal, precious stones and the like can 
never be renewed and extracted again after they are used, and in 
the future there will be no more resources to take their place. 
However, agricultural resources can be renewed. As long as work 
is done on the earth and as long as land, solar energy, and 
water exist, the production of agricultural crops will continue. 
  In its present economic circumstances, our country has no 
choice but to give more attention to the agriculture sector to 
get away from reliance on limited and fluctuating oil revenues. 
  Dr. Seyyed Mohammad Hoseyni, president of both the Food 
Sciences College and Iran Food Industries and Sciences Society, 
announced that there are more than 2,000 active food industries 
producing units in the country. He said: Because of its varied 
atmosphere and its 12 different climates, its productive soil 
and its adequate light, Iran produces some of the best quality 
agricultural crops in the world, crops such as Jaharom lemons, 
bam citrus, Rafsanjan and Damghan pistachios, Mashhad melons, 
and Khuzestan dates. Just as is apparent from Dr. Hoseyni's 
remarks, Iran has no problem with the production of agricultural 
crops, and the God-given and natural resources in the country 
are considered a suitable ground for any kind of agricultural 
activity. In his view however, numerous causes have kept our 
country from using all its capacities and talents in the 
agricultural sector. 
  In his view, there are currently weaknesses in the 
management 
of some of Iran's food industries because the managers in this 
industrial sector usually do not have the needed specialist 
skills and efficiency. At the same time, however, there are also 
managers who manage their producing units at the level of an 
international institution in accordance with world standards. 
  It appears that the lack of modern machinery and the 
distance 
in terms of technology between Iran's food industries and the 
other comparable producing units in the world are considered two 
of this industry's problems, yet if basic and fundamental 
measures were taken to equip and rebuild the food industries, 
our country would be able to compete with many of the world's 
exporters in the production and export of various foodstuffs. 
  Activity in the production and export of food must be done 
with care and precision, because otherwise in the long term it 
is possible that the nation's food exports could suffer a severe 
blow. For this reason, on the one hand we must plan to 
understand the international markets and on the other hand, by 
standardizing the production of consumer food products 
domestically and maintaining constant quality control, we must 
take our place in the international markets and especially in 
those of neighboring and Islamic countries. 
  Hoseyn Vakili has a doctorate in commercial management. In 
this regard, he adds: Some of the world's markets are eager for 
Iran's food products. In developing our exports, we must not 
covet all of the international markets, because this is quite 
dangerous, and it is not even economical. For example, in all 
the Islamic nations, whose populations total more than 1 
billion, there are customers for food and canned goods made in 
the Islamic Republic of Iran. Our exporters must put their 
greatest attention and emphasis on the markets in the Islamic 
nations. 
  Dr. Vakili, who was recently chosen as the official in 
charge 
of the Iran Canned Goods Cooperative Company, discussed the 
necessity to liberate the nation's economy from its reliance on 
oil revenues. He said: Iran's economy, which has certain 
industrial distinctions compared to the other nations in the 
world, can plan for exports of metallic and nonmetallic 
products, food products, and handicrafts. Ultimately, with a 
variety of foreign exchange-producing incomes from various 
sources, the reliance on oil revenues will gradually be reduced. 
  At the same time he warned that the fever for exporting 
nonoil goods is high now and every exporter, especially in the 
food industries, is trying to export his products while adhering 
more or less to acceptable international standards, in order to 
earn foreign exchange. This is considered dangerous in 
international trade, because when first developing nonoil 
exports, if we do not observe predetermined standards, 
indicators, and regulations, it is possible that our products 
could be permanently excluded from the competition among 
comparable goods, which are superior on international markets, 
and they will lose the ability to compete. 
  Therefore if we do not take international standards into 
consideration with regard to our country's export goods and 
products, we will be cut out of the international markets in the 
near future, and we will not find it easy to get back in. It is 
perhaps for this reason that it is necessary to set standards 
for export products. If the nation's exporters do not adhere to 
international regulations and laws to standardize their 
products, not only will they get nowhere exporting, they will 
also damage the credibility of Iran's export products and goods 
on the international markets. 
  In the near future, competition on the international markets 
will be more complicated, with most nations joining the GATT 
accord. Naturally nations will have to think about themselves in 
this confusing world market. While making the necessary decision 
about whether or not to become a part of GATT, they will be 
seeking suitable markets for their export goods. 
  On the other hand, studies that have been done show that the 
added value of the food industries compared to other producing 
and economic units is quite high, and this is considered one of 
the undeniable benefits of this industry. A simple comparison 
between the revenues and expenses of the food industries with 
those of oil shows that investment in these industries is much 
more economical than in the oil sector and comparable areas. 
  Dr. Hoseyni, chief of the Society of Specialists in the Food 
Industries and Sciences, says in this regard that one ton of 
exported oil earns about $80 in foreign exchange revenues and 
consumes about $10 to $20 in foreign exchange, and consequently 
a maximum of about $60 to $70 in foreign exchange comes into the 
country, but a ton of export tomatoes sells for at least $500 
and only consumes $70 in foreign exchange. Therefore, the 
country receives about $430 for every ton of tomatoes it exports. 
  Likewise, the price of a ton of concentrated fruit juice on 
the international markets is about $1,300, and it consumes no 
more than $300 foreign exchange. Consequently the country 
receives about $1,000 for every ton of concentrated fruit juice 
it exports. 
  Although these revenues are significant, packaged 
agricultural products have not been exported and these goods 
cannot have that much revenue. For this reason, investment in 
the conversion industries in the agricultural sector is 
important. Statistics show that 30 to 50 percent of the food 
produced in the Third World and in Iran is destroyed between 
harvest and consumption. The Fruit and Produce Union has 
announced that of the 15 million tons of fruit and summer 
vegetables produced in the country annually, about 4.5 million 
tons is destroyed in various ways between harvest time and 
consumption. In this same regard, Fereydun Golafra, manager of 
the specialist journal KESHAVARZ, writes in an editorial in 
issue 170 of this journal: While every year about 400,000 tons 
of tomatoes is processed by our nation's conversion industries, 
only about 6,000 tons of tomato paste is exported, mostly in 
cans. This weakness is due to the fact that the ability to 
package and even produce tomato paste in Iran is less than what 
it should be. 
  For example, a country like Italy alone can produce about 
350,000 tons of tomato paste per year, packaged in small cans. 
Some of the tomato-paste-producing units in this country have 
the capacity to produce more than 70,000 tons per year, yet the 
largest tomato-paste-producing factory in Iran only has the 
ability to produce 12,000 tons per year. 
  Due to this very shortage of packaging and conversion 
industries, our country, despite its extensive resources for 
producing tomato paste, is unable to participate actively in 
international markets, and it even drives away customers because 
of its inability to answer their needs. Ultimately, the world 
markets do not even open an account for tomato paste and other 
Iranian food exports. Golafra noted that last year Iran lost a 
32,000-ton tomato-paste deal with Libya because it could not 
answer the customer's need in time. 
  The manager of the journal KESHAVARZ also noted that in the 
future our country will need to have a presence on the 
international markets more than it does today in order to be 
able on the one hand to reduce food product losses and on the 
other hand to be able to return to vegetable and fruit growers 
the earnings of their labors, thereby helping the economy to 
prosper. 
  He also recommended that to increase food exports the 
government must insure all export contracts. 
  It appears that this recommendation can be given attention 
and have an effect on the development of nonoil exports, 
provided that the exports are regulated and done in such a way 
that they do not damage the credibility of the nation's products. 
  Some other experts believe that the main problem with Iran's 
food industries is the weakness of its packaging and shipping of 
goods. 
  Behruz Forutan, a member of the board of directors of the 
Iran Food Industries and Sciences Society and executive director 
of Behruz Food Industries, is one of these people. He said: 
Packaging has various advantages, including the fact that in 
preserving the food, helping with the distribution and sale of 
the goods, facilitating storage and shipping, increasing the 
amount of marketing and providing the necessary information and 
instructions for the proper use of the package's contents have a 
strong effect on the customer. 
  He explained that the world's food packaging and 
preservation 
industry is 180 years old, but in Iran this industry has no more 
than a 60-year history. According to a study by experts, about 
7.2 million tons of the 15 million tons of agricultural and farm 
products produced in Iran can be sent to market in packaged 
form. Before the canning industry appeared, in the old days many 
Iranian families spent the spring, summer, and fall storing some 
of the food they needed such as jams and vinegar pickles for the 
winter. Sometimes in the cold regions such as Azerbaijan they 
fried meat in animal fat and kept it as stew in special crocks 
for consumption later and in the winter. 
  Now, however, with the growth in the population, the 
increase 
in the number of urban residents and changes in lifestyles from 
rural to urban modes, the traditional ways of preserving food 
are also gradually being forgotten. Therefore, to make the best 
use of food and keep it from spoiling and also to find 
international markets, while we should pay attention to 
traditional methods such as drying vegetables for domestic 
consumption, more attention must also be given to the conversion 
and canning industries. 
  Based on statistics from the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), Americans convert to canned goods 90 percent 
of their tomatoes, 79 percent of their olives, 65 percent of 
their green beans, 62 percent of their green peas, 54 percent of 
their sweet corn, 41 percent of their asparagus, 55 percent of 
their pears, 75 percent of their apricots, 50 percent of their 
peaches, and 40 percent of their apples, but according to the 
executive director of Behruz Food Industries, for various 
reasons such as the lack of packaging and canning industries in 
our country, every year at least 300,000 tons of apples (30 
percent of the entire crop), 50 percent of the grapes, and 
400,000 to 600,000 tons of citrus fruit (25 percent of the crop) 
were destroyed. 
  The production of packaged and canned food in Iran is so 
insignificant that nothing is left for exports. According to the 
statistics from Iran Customs, in the period between the years 
1367 [21 March 1988-20 March 1989] and 1369 [21 March 1990-20 
March 1991] an average of $7 to $10 million in packaged food was 
exported. According to these statistics, 90 percent of Iran's 
food exports were not packaged. 
  Thus, with a simple calculation it can be seen that in the 
area of food industries our country has not had the necessary 
development and progress at all. In this regard, however, one 
keep in mind the important point that the level of consumption 
of packaged food in Iran does not have to be as it is in the 
West, because basically the tastes of the people in the East and 
especially Iranians do not resemble or have points in common at 
all with Westerners. 
  The people in our society in the rural areas and even in the 
northernmost points in the cities will not consume packaged 
foods as long as they are not forced to do so. They prefer to 
purchase their food fresh and cook it themselves, although these 
kinds of packaged foods claimed their place in the Western food 
basket years ago. Despite the difference between the tastes of 
our people and those of the West with regard to the consumption 
of packaged and canned foods, it cannot be claimed that the the 
food packaging and conversion industries in the agricultural 
sector have grown sufficiently in Iran. Every insider in the 
food industries gives reasons that are obstacles to the growth 
of the food and conversion industries in Iran. Some believe that 
the collection of taxes on export food and also the heavy 
tariffs on the needed imported machinery and equipment are among 
the major obstacles to growth in the conversion and food 
industries. In the same regard it is said that export foods are 
only 50 percent tax exempt yet export goods are exempt from the 
payment of all taxes. 
  On the other hand, a number of insiders in the food 
industries also consider the import of foreign food, which is 
sometimes unsanitary and lacking in standards, is also one of 
the problems in this sector. According to the view of these 
people, along with the means, which are being made available for 
food producers and exporters, the paths for importing beverages, 
chocolates and in general all the foods whose counterparts are 
produced at higher quality inside the country must be blocked. 
Of course, this not be done in such a way that the possibility 
of competition is eliminated and that domestic food producers, 
despite having undesirable products, are content and satisfied 
in a market they dominate and in which there is no competitor. 
  The shortage of currency in circulation and investment are 
among the other existing problems of those working in the food 
industries. As the result of the unification of the foreign 
exchange rate the price of raw materials and imported machinery 
has risen sharply and this has caused the currency in 
circulation to be insufficient to meet the needs of the owners 
of this industry. Apparently so far the banking system has not 
supported the food and conversion industries as much as it 
should either. 
  Likewise, due to the obstacles in the path of production, 
investment in our country has always been more in the services 
and commercial sectors than in the other sectors society needs. 
For this purpose, and to develop food conversion industries and 
increase nonoil exports, the commercial banks should grant 
credit facilities at low profit rates to encourage investors so 
they will build factories for the packaging and conversion 
industries in the agricultural sector. 
  Elsewhere in his talk, Forutan discussed the necessity to 
activate the Export Guarantee Fund and to coordinate food export 
and import laws and regulations in a way that is appropriate for 
the current requirements. He said: The shipping problem is 
considered another deterrent to the development of food 
industries, because due to the susceptibility to spoilage for 
these kinds of materials, they must be moved inside and outside 
the country in the shortest time possible. However the high cost 
of shipping, especially via aircraft, on the one hand and on the 
other hand the lack of the necessary refrigeration at the ports 
and points of departure, are bringing producers up against 
increasing problems. 
  It is also absolutely necessary to create centers for 
research and study in the food industries sector. By organizing 
and unifying the research under way in the food industries, 
wasted time and energy can be prevented to a great extent and 
this work can gradually become valuable. 
  Food industries research units can be guided and supported 
by 
the government in all the food industries units with the 
cooperation of food science colleges. If these units are 
equipped with the necessary tools and if they do not remain 
uninformed of the research and achievements of other comparable 
research institutions in the world, they will be able on the one 
hand effectively to teach and train food industry specialists 
and technicians and on the other hand to increase the country's 
ability with regard to food exports and to develop 
competitiveness on international markets compared to comparable 
products. In any case the problem of packaging in Iran's food 
industries is not merely a matter of art, design, attractive 
packaging, and quality printing. The main problem is the weak 
technology and lack of advanced equipment in this sector of the 
industry. 
  Mehdi Mojahedi, member of the board of directors of the 
Khorasan Union of Compote and Canned Goods Factories, said that 
Iran's production of many agricultural crops is much greater 
than its domestic need. He described the conversion industries 
as a powerful arm in the agriculture sector. He said: Due to the 
lack of packaging industries, a large amount of the food 
produced in Iran goes out of the country without packaging and 
without authorization via the nation's western, eastern, 
northern, and southern borders, so that unofficial exports of 
food are several times greater than the exports done officially 
adhering to the rules and regulations through points of 
departure to official markets. 
  In any case, although during previous years the food and 
conversion industries sector has been ignored, now the nation's 
executive officials have realized this industry's importance in 
answering the needs of domestic consumption and also its role in 
earning foreign exchange. For this reason, with the decisions 
that have been made, one may hope that during the Second 
National Five-Year Social, Economic and Cultural Development 
Plan, the food and conversion industries will grow and develop 
more and find their place in society's economic affairs. 
  According to Dr. Seyyed Mohammad Hoseyni, chief of the 
Society of Specialists in the Food Industries and Sciences and 
Majles deputy, 350 billion rials in loans for the development of 
food industries has been allocated from Note 3 in this year's 
budget bill. 
  He discussed the quality of Iran's agricultural crops. He 
said: Fortunately, due to the high quality of its agricultural 
crops, Iran always has the potential of producing large amounts 
of food exports. For example, Iran already has regular customers 
in advanced countries such as Germany, Switzerland, England and 
a few other countries for its pistachios, canned goods (tomato 
paste, pickles, tuna fish, and other things), mayonnaise, and 
various kinds of dried fruits, despite the fact that it is very 
difficult to compete in these markets and all food exporters are 
making efforts to establish themselves in the European markets. 
  With all this, our country still must seek to find new 
markets throughout the world and especially in the Islamic 
nations and in the region and it must obtain its appropriate and 
rightful share of the world economy. To keep from falling behind 
our competitors on world markets, we must give more importance 
to research, and along with that we must not neglect to equip 
and rebuild the machinery in our producing units to create 
variety and innovation in packaging. 
  Dr. Hoseyni, chief of the Food Sciences University, proposes 
in this respect that with regard to the food industries, the 
training of technicians and the research it does, our country 
should be in continuous contact with countries like England, 
Switzerland, Holland, Denmark, Italy, France, and Japan, which 
have made significant progress in the food industries. He called 
upon Iranian food industries specialists living outside the 
country to correspond with the Society of Food Sciences and 
Industries Specialists, to participate in the relevant 
congresses and seminars having to do with food inside the 
country and to make their findings available to the food 
industries and those working in it. 
  Along with the efforts the government and the public are 
making to develop food industries, one must not forget one very 
important point and that is that the food industries in every 
region of the country must be appropriate for that region's 
potential, because otherwise the costs of moving agricultural 
crops will be very high. 
  As was said, in some of the nation's fruitful provinces the 
food industries are a suitable basis for development and growth. 
In view of the fact that each agricultural crop is harvested at 
a specific time of the year, the necessary proportion must be 
created between the size of food crops and the conversion 
industries. 
  In a province like Khorasan with its relatively vast size, 
some agricultural crops, orchard produce and summer vegetables 
are produced in abundance and in superb quality. For this reason 
the development of the conversion industries in such provinces 
must never be overlooked. 
  According to Mehdi Mojahedi, member of the board of 
directors 
of the Khorasan Union of Compote and Canned Goods Factories, in 
this province there are already 55 major units producing compote 
and canned goods, 10 of which have been recently established, 
and all of which have the governor-general's approval. Although 
the production of some agricultural and farm crops in some 
provinces is much greater than the provinces themselves need, 
one must realize that a number of regions in our country, due to 
their geographic position, do not have the ability to produce 
significant agricultural crops. 
  In some population centers like Tehran, the people are 
strictly consumers and with the exception of a few farms on the 
outskirts, there is effectively no particular crop produced in 
this province. Therefore it is necessary to make maximum use of 
the producing capacity of the various provinces, raise the 
profitability of agricultural lands, make use of agricultural 
and orchard machinery and to the extent possible to consolidate 
lands to increase returns. 
  Shahrokh Zahiri, executive director of a major food industry 
unit, which has been active in this area for almost two decades, 
emphasized the need to make use of skilled and expert manpower 
in this sector of industry. He said: Food producers must have 
knowledge of this work in order to produce the ideal product and 
at the same time they must prevent the negative propaganda 
against domestic food industries. 
  At the same time, to the extent possible, domestically made 
machinery must be used to develop and equip the food industries, 
so that while creating the resources for the growth of industry, 
the departure of foreign exchange will be prevented. Behruz 
Forutan, a member of the board of directors of the Iran Food 
Industries and Sciences Society, noted in this regard that so 
far various experts from Asian and European countries have 
visited the Iran Food Industries factories at this society's 
invitation, and have been impressed by the positive performance 
of the machinery made in Iran. 
  He believes that we must have a national motivation for the 
work we do, leave the "nonrenewable mines" for future 
generations and to make maximum use of renewable resources such 
as the agricultural sector, fisheries and manpower, which can 
neither be renewed nor preserved for future generations. 
  Forutan added that it is very important to package food for 
domestic and foreign consumption, because every consumer item 
such as food, carpets, cloth, canned goods, and other things 
must attract the eye of the consumer and get his attention. 
  Iran's geographic and strategic position and our country's 
position on the globe, which is about the same distance from 
both East and West and has numerous Muslim nations as neighbors, 
confers a valuable privilege on those who live in this land. 
Forutan, a member of the board of directors of the Iran Food 
Industries and Sciences Society, noted that shared religious 
affiliations, ease of access to the region's markets and similar 
tastes are among the factors that give Iranian products special 
distinction in the markets of the Islamic nations, and all of 
these factors can be used to develop exports and earn foreign 
exchange. 
  Mohammad Ashkuri, formerly executive director of the "One 
and 
One" Food Production Factory is active even now in the 
production, installation, and start up of food machinery and 
equipment. He assessed Iran's existing technical potential. He 
said: Iranian technical experts in the manufacture and 
installation of machinery to produce food products have grown to 
the point that sometimes they can take complicated foreign or 
domestically made machinery and install it in other countries. 
  He emphasized the need to use God-given and natural 
blessings 
such as the varying climates in the different regions of Iran. 
He said: With the exception of the nation's northern regions, in 
the rest of the provinces we have sunny weather about 300 days 
out of the year, and we must not overlook the situation that few 
countries enjoy other than ours, which is that the average 
production of various kinds of fruit in Iran is greater than the 
established international per-capital level. 
  He emphasized that more than 84 percent of the raw materials 
needed by the food industries are produced in the agricultural 
sector. For this reason, Iran's food industries should be 
supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the other 
ministries should be active in relation to this sector solely in 
construction and industry affairs. 
  Continuing his remarks, Ashkuri said that to the extent we 
are able we should build the machinery needed by the food and 
conversion industries inside the country, but if we cannot we 
must import some of them, because no country in the world can 
produce all the equipment it needs on its own. 
  However, what has not been discussed very much up until now 
is how to revitalize and make better use of of the traditional 
methods of preserving and keeping food in Iran. 
  Iranians have long had various methods for keeping 
vegetables, fruit, and even dairy products and meat, some of 
which cost very little and have also passed the test in terms of 
hygiene. Those working in the country's food industries should 
not completely promote Western methods of keeping food. They 
should also do research and study on traditional methods of 
keeping food in Iran, and they should make changes in the 
traditional ways of drying vegetables, seeds and grains, because 
by drying some fruits and vegetables, not only are their special 
characteristics not diminished, but also sometimes with the 
actions and reactions that take place, the amount of vitamins in 
these kinds of crops sometimes even increases. 
  Therefore, even if it is necessary to develop the conversion 
industries to reach export food markets, we should not plan for 
the people inside the country in the same way as for foreign 
markets and put products on the domestic markets that are 
suitable for the tastes of others. 
  The final point is that some export goods such as saffron, 
licorice, henna, and other things, although apparently slight in 
volume, command a very high international price, higher than the 
price of the products and crops that are made from these 
products. For this reason, now that the world's most desirable 
saffron is produced in our country, we can also produce the 
subsequent products that are made using these raw materials and 
sell them on the international markets with very high added 
value.

<F P=106> [Article by Amin Tahiri] </F>
  [Text] "Iran and Iraq have signed a peace treaty." This 
interesting news was announced at an economic conference held in 
Manama, Bahrain earlier this month by the governor of the 
Central Bank of Iran, Mohammed Hoseyn 'Adeli. 
  However, no sooner had the typewriter begun to record this 
news when more informed sources in Tehran denied the report and 
described it as "completely devoid of veracity." 
  One source said, "The governor does not follow foreign 
policy." Perhaps he imagines that Iran actually signed a peace 
treaty with Iraq. 
  The matter was quickly forgotten. Undoubtedly, 'Adeli, a 
technocrat with little experience in political matters, had 
committed an innocent stupidity. 
  The issue of the future of Iranian-Iraqi relations is always 
present on the rare occasions when Iranian foreign policy 
options are discussed in a balanced mood, far from provocative 
slogans. 
  Iranian political experts agree that the establishment of a 
firm foundation for relations with Iraq is still one of Iran's 
most important priorities, inasmuch as the two neighboring 
states have been holding talks for more than five years since 
agreeing to a UN-sponsored cease-fire. They have also achieved a 
better understanding of each other's positions through a number 
of high-level contacts. Moreover, if the news coming from Tehran 
is correct, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati will 
soon head an official delegation to Baghdad, the "first" of its 
kind since the mullahs took power in Iran in 1979. 
  The idea of an attempt to improve relations with Iraq has 
been gaining force in Tehran for a number of reasons: The main 
reason is that the pragmatic wing in President Rafsanjani's 
leadership has lost much of its influence over formulating 
foreign policy. Rafsanjani wanted to bring revolutionary Iran 
closer to moderate forces in the region by establishing strong 
relations with Western Europe and Japan. A normalization with 
the United States is still his medium-term goal. 
  However, this strategy has failed because potential foreign 
partners of Iran have refused to do anything to help strengthen 
Rafsanjani's position in Tehran. The general idea abroad is that 
if the mullahs are conciliatory, it is because they are weak and 
they should therefore not be helped to gain new power. There is 
also a strong conviction that the mullahs have not abandoned 
their long-range dream of exporting the revolution and 
establishing an empire in the name of the Khomeyniist ideology. 
  Thus, Iran has failed to convince the outside world that it 
no longer wants to behave on the basis of an aggressive, 
expansionist ideology. Hence, the general hesitation to develop 
more than a certain modicum of relations with Iran. 
  The star of the radical elements in the rightwing leadership 
of 'Ali Khamene'i, the supreme leader in Tehran, has risen 
again. These elements are advocating a new foreign policy 
course. They maintain that the failure of the normalization 
policy requires Iran to seek new friends and partners to break 
its current isolation. Velayati's recent tour of black Africa 
and several formerly communist states in Europe was a part of 
this new effort. Political circles in Tehran have also begun to 
renew the idea of transforming the dormant Nonaligned Movement 
into a "pole" in global politics. Accordingly, Iran's 
behind-the-scenes relations with Serbia, the special relations 
that have developed between Iran and Ion Iliescu's new communist 
government in Romania, and Iran's increasingly close relations 
with North Korea are all part of a new strategy. 
  Regarding the region itself, the weakening of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council [GCC] continues to be a priority for Tehran, 
which has always considered the GCC a part of the effort to 
weaken Iran. 
  Such weakening is effected in part by encouraging 
"disturbances" in the politics of several GCC countries--e.g., 
Oman and Qatar--and by strongly wooing Kuwait, especially by 
constantly pointing to the inevitable Iraqi danger. 
  Outside of the Gulf region, Iran has escalated its efforts 
to 
expand its influence in Yemen and to build new bridges with 
Jordan. The desire to woo the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has 
been so strong that the Iranian Embassy in Jordan actually 
heaped praise on King Husayn after Jordan expelled 22 [Iranian] 
diplomats from Amman. Relations with Sudan, on the other hand, 
have become relatively tepid. This is attributed in part to 
Tehran's abhorrence of Hasan al-Turabi's desire to promote 
himself as the leader of the fundamentalist movement instead of 
Khamene'i. 
  Iran's relations with Syria have also become tepid, because 
Tehran believes that Syria has now certainly joined the 
"American camp." 
  Thus, the dream of Baghdad-Tehran axis now appears more 
attractive than at any time in the past. However, the 
establishment of such an axis is more easily said than done, 
because both countries must first settle their bilateral 
conflicts. Moreover, many in Tehran are convinced that President 
Saddam Husayn's regime may not last beyond the end of this year, 
and Baghdad, for its part, knows that any axis with Tehran would 
dash all of its hopes for the lifting of the sanctions imposed 
on it and for its return to international society. 
  In other words, the mullahs cannot achieve any strategic 
objective by establishing a firm alliance with Iraq as long as 
Saddam is in power. At the same time, Iraq cannot look to Iran 
as a strong partner that can fill the vacuum created by the loss 
of its relations with the moderate Arab countries and the [West]. 
  Thus, Iranian-Iraqi relations are likely to continue to be 
uneven for a period that is certain to continue until the two 
countries adopt new policies, perhaps under the auspices of new 
leaders. Therefore, it is certain that 'Adeli's announcement of 
a peace treaty was premature.

<F P=106> [Excerpts from an interview with A. Keramane, governor of </F>
the Bank of Algeria, by the APS; place and date not given: 
"`Adjustment Is First of All an Internal Necessity'" -- first 
paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] In an interview with the APS, Mr. Keramane explained 
the agreement with the IMF; here are excerpts from this 
interview. 
  [APS] Mr. Governor, Algeria has just signed a new agreement 
with the IMF in the particular conditions that our country is 
experiencing. How would you describe it, especially as far as 
its implications for our economic and financial situation are 
concerned? 
  [Keramane] You are right to mention the particular 
conditions 
that our country is experiencing, which refer first of all to 
the current economic crisis--a crisis which, except for petty 
differences between factions, has brought about a national 
consensus on the need to get to the root of the problem. In 
other words, it is an established fact that in order to achieve 
a diversified modern economy, better equipped to open itself to 
the world, adjustment is a necessity, and would be so even if 
oil sold for $30 a barrel. Adjustment is first of all an 
internal necessity resulting from the situation of our economy, 
not from any treatment imposed upon us from the outside. 
  This being so, because oil does not sell for $30 and since 
our debt service is one of the heaviest in the world, it is 
useful, if not indispensable, that this adjustment should get 
the IMF support. Especially considering that in recent years, in 
the context of the new international order, the IMF has become a 
kingpin in international financial relations. 
  Our internal social problems force us to look for the most 
gradual transition possible, and therefore to try and avoid the 
shock therapy which, by the way, did not always yield the 
expected results in those countries that already used it. This 
explains why the negotiations were long and difficult. 
  [APS] Will the stabilization measures that Algeria is 
beginning to implement, with the devaluation of the national 
currency and credit tightening, remain in force for the entire 
term of the one-year agreement, or should we expect other 
similar adjustments to follow? 
  [Keramane] In a stabilization program, most if not all 
measures are taken at the start of the program. 
  We must define new economic parameters and then let economic 
operators, the production sector and the various agents adjust 
to the new context. Economic operators need stability, which is 
the objective of the stabilization program; therefore, we are 
not going to keep changing the rules of the game. 
  As far as the rate of exchange is concerned, 36 dinars to 
the 
dollar is a realistic rate that may provide a basis for 
stabilization. It represents a reasonable adjustment, which was 
necessary and, at the same time, is sufficient. Certainly, you 
might say that a 40-percent devaluation is a lot, but you should 
recall that, a little over two years ago, negotiations with the 
IMF revolved around a rate of 32 dinars to the dollar so that, 
taking into account inflation and the increasing financial 
problems we have had in the past two years, it is not excessive 
to have reached conclusions on the basis of 36 Algerian dinars 
to the dollar. 
  This, we believe, is how this devaluation should be judged. 
  As far as interest rates are concerned, they were slightly 
increased, precisely to support the new exchange rate level. In 
this case too, the objective of the stabilization program is 
generally to achieve positive real interest rates, i.e., a 
structure with interest rates higher than those of the structure 
we just agreed on. 
  The bank lending rates will be relatively stabilized, and 
the 
cost of credit to the economy should not increase appreciably. 
The objective is to contain inflation and achieve a reasonable 
underlying inflation rate rather than to systematically attempt 
to achieve positive real interest rates. Actually, this new 
interest rate structure anticipates inflation control. 
  In other words, the essential objective of the program is to 
bring inflation under control and, by the end of the year, to 
achieve a reduced inflation rate in line with the interest rate 
structure we agreed on. 
  Borrowing rates, for their part, will increase, and the CNEP 
[Algerian National Savings and Insurance Bank] also just gave 
the signal. This will stimulate savings and enable banks to 
allocate intermediate and long-term credits more efficiently. 
  To answer your question more bluntly, I can say that we are 
not contemplating any additional surprise measures. This being 
so, we should also not operate in a rigid context. 
  In such a program, you monitor the real economy, and you may 
have to adjust to its evolution. 
  [APS] What material measures are you contemplating to soften 
the impact of the current adjustments on the purchasing power of 
households? 
  [Keramane] The problem of the household purchasing power is 
linked to that of inflation control. First, we must define the 
inflation problem. 
  At times, as was the case for instance during Ramadan, there 
may be large price increases on some products, but the inflation 
picture, as reflected in the annual inflation rate, is 
relatively lower since, for 1993, it was estimated at about 20 
percent, compared with 32 percent in 1992. 
  Devaluation should not translate into large price increases. 
You should not make the simple reasoning of transposing the 
devaluation percentage into price increases. 
  First, because many products are manufactured locally; 
therefore, only imported products will be directly affected by 
the devaluation. They will be affected somewhat later, when new 
inventories are brought in. Normally, current inventories should 
be sold without any price increase. 
  As far as industrially manufactured goods are considered, 
inflation will come into play only through imported inputs that, 
depending on the product, account for a varying proportion of 
the final product cost and, in this case too, do so with a 
certain lag. 
  Therefore, the effect of devaluation on prices should 
normally be moderate and staggered in time. 
  We should recall that the objective of bringing inflation 
under control is an essential objective of the stabilization 
program, and one that will be achieved through a whole series of 
measures. 
  This is the best way to protect the purchasing power of 
households. Of course, for the most underprivileged the program 
provides that the social safety net will not only be retained, 
but also improved. 
  [APS] What about the impact on the operation of the 
production plant? 
  [Keramane] As far as the operation of the production plant 
is 
concerned, now that the stabilization program has been adopted 
the essential factor is that the production sector will find it 
easier to import its raw materials, its spare parts, and all the 
things that constitute the production input. 
  This means, in particular, that companies will have access 
to 
cash to buy products commonly used in their production processes. 
  As a result, the cost of credit will be less. Perhaps some 
companies could even reduce their raw material inventories since 
they will be assured to have ready access to their supplies. 
  Generally speaking, therefore, these measures linked to 
foreign trade and import financing should have a twofold 
positive effect on the production sector: reduced costs and 
increased operating flexibility. 
  [APS] The easing of restrictions on foreign trade implies 
commercial convertibility of the dinar; is Algeria getting close 
to this objective? 
  [Keramane] The stabilization program implies an easing of 
restriction on foreign trade and will provide a number of 
measures to that effect simultaneously with measures that the 
Bank of Algeria will take concerning import financing. We can 
say, therefore, that this program will make it possible to 
achieve the objective of commercial convertibility of the dinar. 
  [APS] Companies, both state-owned and private, might again 
raise the question of exchange losses? 
  [Keramane] This question was raised after the 1991 
devaluation and, as you said, will probably be raised again. 
Today, however, its extent is reduced by the fact that operators 
were able to protect themselves against currency risks through 
the futures quotation system set up by the Bank of Algeria. 
Certainly, the problem of exchange losses is a major problem and 
the Algerian Government took it into account in their 
negotiations with the IMF. 
  It will be possible to set up a system to soften the impact 
of devaluation on the debt of state-owned and private companies. 
Of course, compensation will be only partial and in keeping with 
the nature of the economic activity considered. 
  [APS] Does the correction of internal financial balances, as 
a major stage in the structural adjustment of the economy, mean 
that the Bank of Algeria will follow a policy of strict 
financial austerity, irrespective of the priorities of economic 
recovery? 
  [Keramane] For an economy, overall financial austerity is 
linked to the existence, or lack, of a budget deficit, which may 
be big or small. As far as the budget deficit is concerned, 
which amounted to 9 percent of the gross domestic product in 
1993, the stabilization program will make it possible to aim for 
a post-stabilization deficit of 5 percent in 1994. It will be 
further reduced in 1995. The revenue increase resulting from the 
devaluation and the expected effects of the rescheduling will 
make it possible not just to achieve the budget deficit 
reduction objective, but also to provide increased resources for 
credits to the economy. 
  It will therefore become possible to give the necessary 
importance to economic recovery without monetary laxity and 
without starting again to print more money. Actually, as far as 
monetary expansion is concerned, the program sets an objective 
that aims to strengthen the downward trend of money supply 
observed in recent year. 
  As you know, monetary expansion reached 24 percent in 1992 
and 21 percent in 1993, whereas fiduciary money grew by 17.6 
percent in 1992 and 14.3 percent in 1993, respectively. 
  These figures show that monetary expansion was far less in 
recent years than some would say, and the trend toward a 
reduction of these rates will continue under this program. 
  [APS] In addition to the billion dollars that the IMF 
intends 
to make available, what can we expect from our economic partners 
in terms of financial contributions? 
  [Keramane] We should first point out that the IMF $1-billion 
contribution is particularly large for a one-year stabilization 
program and for a country like Algeria. It is a sizeable 
contribution to our balance of payments, and it is also a signal 
of the IMF to the international community, at multilateral 
(World Bank, European Community, etc.) as well as at bilateral 
level (with the various partner countries), and to the world's 
financial and banking system. 
  There are a number of credits in the form of [word 
illegible] 
installments that remain available with multilateral partners, 
and the Algerian Government will therefore endeavor to have 
these installments made available as soon as possible, 
simultaneously, with the EEC and with the World Bank as well as 
with other potential multilateral partners such as the Arab 
Monetary Fund and the African Development Bank. 
  We should also make contact to obtain other credits to 
support our balance of payments or to finance projects, as the 
case may be.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mahfoud Nahnah, president of Hamas (Islamic </F>
Society Movement), by M.T. Messaoudi and Zineb O.; place and 
date not given: "Favor Political Solution Over All-Out 
Security"; first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] Despite the dramatic situation being 
experienced by our country, Mahfoud Nahnah, president of Hamas 
[Islamic Society Movement] remains optimistic regarding a 
possible return to civil peace and constitutional legality, 
provided that "armed action is isolated from politics." In this 
interview granted to us, Nahnah tells us that his party has not 
yet stated whether it will participate in the CNT [National 
Transitional Council] and that it would have preferred to see 
the formation of the Sifi government preceded by consultation 
with the parties. 
  [EL WATAN] Mr. Mahfoud Nahnah, is your political group going 
to participate in the National Transitional Council? 
  [Nahnah] Our movement held a lengthy meeting on that subject 
last Thursday, and several opinions were expressed. Some were 
opposed to the movement's participation in the CNT, while 
others, on the other hand, were in favor of it. 
  Personally, I think that if the CNT is going to be like the 
old National Advisory Council, which has no prerogatives or 
power to solve the problems of a legislative nature that are 
facing the country or to debate the position of the government 
and state, I do not see why anyone should go to great lengths to 
set up such a body. 
  If, on the other hand, the CNT is there to overcome the 
crisis of legitimacy and amend government bills so as to 
facilitate a rapid return to elections through more substantial 
dialogue with all the parties that might find themselves within 
that structure for dialogue, I am completely in favor of it. The 
main objective of that dialogue must be the higher interest of 
the country, with no one-upmanship or Byzantine discussions. If 
that is the CNT's objective, our movement will participate in it 
either inside or outside that body in defense of the 
Constitution against all attempts--illegitimate in any case--to 
amend it and in defense of the citizens. 
  [EL WATAN] Your definition of the CNT is practically the 
same 
as that contained in the platform of the national conference; 
participation by Hamas seems to be a sure thing. 
  [Nahnah] As you know, our movement applies the principle of 
shura [consultation] literally. Everyone gives his opinion, and 
my point of view does not count for any more than that of others. 
  [EL WATAN] Has the question been settled within your party? 
  [Nahnah] The question has not been settled. We are holding a 
meeting today (Editor's note: yesterday) at the office of the 
president of the republic. If we see that there is a sincere 
willingness to work in accordance with the principles we have 
set forth, we will be part of the CNT. 
  [EL WATAN] Won't it bother you to be the only one among the 
country's most important parties to be in the CNT? 
  [Nahnah] Our movement does not want to be in the shadow of 
any party whatever. We are free to take the stand we consider 
appropriate without being influenced by one or more parties. We 
may be right or wrong, but the main thing is that we should work 
for the good of the country and for its interests. 
  [EL WATAN] Yesterday--Tuesday--you had a meeting with some 
political parties (Editor's note: the MDA [Movement for 
Democracy in Algeria], the FLN [National Liberation Front], and 
al-Nahdah). Was there any connection between that and the CNT? 
  [Nahnah] Our meeting with a certain number of parties 
yesterday was concerned with something else. We were concerned 
to find ways to restore the citizens' confidence and 
rehabilitate party activity in the eyes of public opinion. The 
second topic discussed during that meeting was the action to be 
taken to drive the specter of despair away from the citizens. In 
the reality of Algeria, the policy of aggravating the crisis and 
that of deterioration have long prevailed. That situation needs 
to be remedied quickly. Our movement is one of those asking the 
current government to provide more transparence and open the 
doors of the economy to domestic and then to international 
initiatives. 
  Domestic and international investors are still reluctant 
because they have no confidence in the laws. By way of example, 
domestic importers have been caught unawares by the devaluation 
of the dinar when their goods arrive in port. Are they supposed 
to pay the old rate or the new one? I consider that a form of 
violence. Our movement's basic concern is to neutralize all the 
reasons or paths leading to violence. 
  [EL WATAN] What do you expect to result from that meeting? 
  [Nahnah] We are still at the stage of drawing up a platform 
that we plan to submit to the office of the President as a 
contribution on our part in proposing solutions to the crisis. 
  [EL WATAN] You are one of the parties and associations that 
have called for a march this coming 8 May. What are your words 
of command? 
  [Nahnah] The march on 8 May will be like the other marches 
that have taken place in our country. Political groups have 
expressed their stand on dialogue. We have another approach--one 
leaning more toward intensified political dialogue--because we 
feel that the current political deadlock cannot be permanently 
resolved by an antiterrorist law and the policy of all-out 
security. We want the demonstration on 8 May to work toward the 
country's development and unity. It must not serve narrow 
partisan interests. If people try to divert the march to other 
objectives, they will have to assume the responsibility. 
  [EL WATAN] You support dialogue with no one excluded, but 
the 
armed groups in the GIA [Armed Islamic Group] reject any 
negotiation with the government. In your opinion, what is the 
proper reaction to that obstinacy? 
  [Nahnah] For our part, we feel that anyone who rejects 
dialogue must present an alternative. That alternative must not 
take the form of a Mahchoucha (Editor's note: sawed-off shotgun) 
or that of an armored vehicle, and it must not be inspired by 
any imported ideology. The tragedy that we are experiencing must 
be resolved by and among Algerians. Algeria belongs to Algerians 
of all kinds and all political convictions. Extremism must not 
have a place in a country that is rich in history and in natural 
and human potentialities. 
  [EL WATAN] Don't you think that the wise men among men of 
religion have failed to do their part to prevent young people in 
particular from being prey to extremism? 
  [Nahnah] Extremism is the phenomenon of this century. It 
does 
not exist only among Islamists. You will find it among 
Christians, Jews, Buddhists, and so on. 
  Extremism has historical causes and objective, 
psychological, 
economic, and social causes. The various regimes in the Arab 
countries were unable or unwilling to get control of this 
problem before it appeared. The intellectuals and men of 
knowledge also failed to take steps to tackle the phenomenon in 
a rigorous scientific manner. And in Algeria, the state did not 
train high-level cadres in the theological area soon enough. 
That is why the doors were thrown open to all comers. The 
single-party system, with all the defects it 
engendered--corruption, for example--also enabled extremism to 
take root. 
  [EL WATAN] What do you think of the Berber cultural demands? 
  [Nahnah] Our movement feels that if any issue concerning the 
country is not taken into consideration and debated, it will 
sooner or later have a snowball effect with harmful 
consequences. There is no objection to a debate on Berber 
culture; the main thing is to be able to express oneself and try 
to persuade others. All the same, it is amazing to see that in a 
country like Switzerland, where four different languages are 
spoken, society is stable, united, and above all prosperous. 
  [EL WATAN] What is your opinion of Mokdad Sifi's government? 
  [Nahnah] It is like all the governments that preceded it. 
The 
winning numbers are drawn by the government out of the same hat. 
We had hoped that this government would not be cooked up in a 
pressure cooker but formed as the result of consultation with 
the parties. Because in our opinion, this government concerns 
the political parties and the citizens generally. The current 
government will meet the same fate as the other governments. But 
what I fear is the fact that these governments may be just a 
means of playing for time. 
  [EL WATAN] Did you meet with certain officials of the former 
FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] during your tour of Europe and the 
Middle East? 
  [Nahnah] We have never met with Rabah Kebir, as some of the 
media have reported, or with officials of the FIS either inside 
or outside the country, except for certain of that party's 
founding members with whom we spoke long before all this. 
  But our hope is that Djeddi and Boukhamkham will strive to 
contact their elected brothers who are members of the Majlis 
al-Shura [consultative council] and the political class with no 
one being excluded. The armed groups will remain, however, and I 
won't conceal from you the fact that we think a solution the 
crisis is very close. 
  [EL WATAN] Do you think that only Islamist extremists are 
behind the terrorism? 
  [Nahnah] The former FIS provides "cover" for a very wide 
spectrum. Many people who do not wish the country well are 
hiding in it. It is true that certain methods of assassination, 
and the confessions of the perpetrators of those assassinations, 
as well as everything we learned in connection with the 
assassination of Shaykh Bouslimani by Djaafar El-Afghani's or 
Sayeh Attia's groups, are the work of Islamist extremists 
pending proof to the contrary. [sentence as published] 
  Also hiding behind that "cover," however, are all those who 
like to fish in troubled waters: organized crime, thieves, 
gangsters, harkis [Algerians who fought for France during the 
revolution], and the sons of members of France's Arab units. So 
Algerians must learn to tell the difference between those people 
and the others. And the political class must be able to 
distinguish between those groups so that politics will emerge 
with democratic freedoms and respect for the Constitution. 
Without those two parameters, the violence will continue. 
  Moreover, it must be pointed out that there is violence in 
every country: Spain, Italy, the United States, and so on. We 
feel that the phenomenon of violence requires a rapid return to 
legality so that every individual who wants to destroy the 
country and sow destruction can be immediately isolated.

<F P=106> [Article by Catherine Simon: "Deceptive Calm of Spring in </F>
Algeria"; first paragraph is LE MONDE introduction] 
  [Text] The murder of two French religious in Algiers 
seems to have brought a brief and artificial period of euphoria 
to an end. 
  Algiers--The emotion aroused by the murder of two French 
religious--killed in the Casbah district on Sunday 8 May--should 
induce foreigners "whose presence in Algeria is not essential," 
as the diplomats put it, to leave the country as quickly as 
possible. The face of the capital has not changed, however. For 
the past three weeks, blood and sun have been coexisting, 
tragedy rubbing shoulders with ordinary routine at intervals of 
only a few hours or a few kilometers. 
  While death was doing its work in an alley in old Algiers on 
Sunday, life was in full swing in the port district, which was 
full of kids, sunlight, and heat. On flowery hillsides and along 
the highways, families were picnicking on the grass and old 
people were taking siestas without a glance at the young people 
flirting not far away. 
  Around Ain Benian west of the capital, the seedy bars in 
Madrague were crowded again. The mountains of grilled red mullet 
and swordfish on paper tablecloths were being washed down with 
rose wine. The nearby beach at Club des Pins was also swarming 
with girls and boys together. 
  Although the good weather has a lot to do with that 
springtime exuberance, the security forces have also done their 
part. The particularly "hot" Islamist fiefs in the Mitidja 
region--Lakhdaria, Medea, Blida, and Dellys--received a forceful 
visit from elite units in March and April. Thanks to often 
ferocious repression, a semblance of calm was restored. Several 
guerrilla chiefs were reportedly killed and their gangs 
dismantled. 
  It is true that many questions remain. The insidious warfare 
between armed Islamist groups and the police remains invisible 
to ordinary observers. Journalists and diplomats alike generally 
have no choice but to feel their way in the fog of official 
communiques, anonymous tracts, personal accounts, and rumors. 
But the recent "clean-up" operations by the Army have apparently 
had noticeable results not only in the capital but throughout 
the Algiers region. In Blida and Medea, not a few women who were 
still subject to fundamentalist edicts just recently have now 
decided to put away their "hijab" (veils). 
  How long will the calm last? No one knows. "That is why we 
must make the most of it: if we're going to die tomorrow anyway, 
we may as well breathe today," said one Algiers woman with a 
brave smile. And with the sun as encouragement, foreigners would 
almost be doing the same. Since the murder of an employee of the 
Russian Embassy in Algiers on 28 March, none of them had felt 
the terrorist wrath. Even the death threats were becoming less 
frequent. That happy period was to be of short duration. 
Suddenly brought back down to earth by the murder of Sister 
Helene Saint Raymond and Brother Henri Verges, foreign 
nationals, especially the French, are again on the alert. 
  The first wave of departures took place last November 
following the kidnapping of three employees of the French 
General Consulate in Algiers. The All Saints holiday had 
provided a good pretext to avoid calling that hasty exodus a 
"repatriation." The Christmas holidays, preceded by a stream of 
murderous attacks on foreigners, gave the signal for a second 
wave of departures. 
  As an indication of that mass exodus, the 1,400 students 
enrolled in French-language schools last September are now down 
to a little less than 300 at the Algiers lycee, the other 
schools having closed their doors in April. For security 
reasons, the six French cultural centers (in Algiers, Oran, 
Annaba, Constantine, Tlemcen, and Tizi-Ouzou) have done the 
same. Their activities have been "suspended" for several weeks 
now. 
  The political uncertainties weighing on Algeria's future 
have 
hardly any chance of reversing that situation. The march by the 
"reconcilers," which was supposed to rally all the 
fundamentalist groups, attracted only a few participants. The 
FLN [National Liberation Front] and the moderate fundamentalists 
in Hamas [Islamic Society Movement] and Ennahdha were not really 
able to mobilize anyone besides their own troops. Those who were 
predicting participation by the former Islamic Salvation Front 
(FIS) were wasting their breath. 
  The murder of the two French religious, having been 
perpetrated less than two hours after the demonstration ended, 
seems to indicate that the terrorist groups, being hostile to 
all dialogue, are disinclined to drop their guard. Speaking 
through Rabah Kebir, president of its executive body abroad, the 
FIS "condemned with the greatest firmness" that double murder, 
calling it "contrary to Islamic teaching," while Henri Tessier, 
archbishop of Algiers, stated that despite that "absurd crime," 
"it was more essential than ever to increase the number of 
places where Christians and Muslims cooperate in getting to know 
and respect each other." 
  Are the sorcerer's apprentices to be found exclusively in 
the 
Islamist nebula? Common sense would say so. But common sense is 
not exactly one of the most widely distributed virtues in this 
bruised country, where the vehemence of passions and the 
parochial spirit--or perhaps we should say the spirit of the 
minaret--all too often take the place of a political program.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Algeria on Hold"] </F>
  [Text] The murder of two French religious and the fiasco of 
the demonstration for national "reconciliation" in Algiers on 
Sunday 8 March were a reminder of the fragility of the calm 
being experienced by that country in recent weeks. The calm 
atmosphere had led a good many people to return to an almost 
ordinary life--a life of strolling about and going to the beach. 
  If there was detente, it was bought at a high price, 
considering that the Army, which for a time had seemingly 
abandoned the field to armed Islamist groups, resumed its 
offensive in fundamentalist bastions both in the eastern and the 
western part of the country. It did not spare the 
means--including napalm, among other things--in its attempt to 
get the better of its opponents at the risk of harming the 
innocent. 
  The armed Islamist groups were probably hit hard, but 
despite 
that, they are not ready to let go. They are more convinced than 
ever that victory is to be found at the end of a gun and that 
nothing can be won around the green baize of a conference table. 
Their fierce resistance promotes the goals of the "politicians" 
in the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), especially its leaders, 
Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj, who can thus raise the stakes in 
their fight against the government, which is striving to draw 
them into the institutional game. 
  By refusing to participate in the march for reconciliation, 
the "party of God" won a victory by default. By murdering two 
Catholic religious, the most radical of the Islamists tried to 
go even further and show anyone who might tend to forget it that 
time does not dull their combativeness and that it will 
eventually work in their favor. 
  In assuming the office of president, General Lamine Zeroual 
gave the impression that he wanted to find a political solution 
to the crisis being experienced by the country rather than 
relying on the law-and-order approach. He went about it by 
surrounding himself with men who were not hostile to that view 
of things and by initiating discreet dialogue with the Islamist 
leaders. It must be admitted that for the moment, he has gotten 
nothing in return. 
  The government is being forced to have two irons in the 
fire. 
It must simultaneously engage in warfare with the armed groups 
and hold talks with the Islamist leaders in the visiting room at 
Blida Prison, while at the same time not burning its bridges 
with the traditional political forces, be they "reconcilers" or 
"eradicators"--advocates of strong-arm tactics--who are always 
ready to draw it into their own camp. And, above all, without 
endangering the unity of the Armed Forces, which are the 
cornerstone of any solution. 
  Algeria therefore seems to be taking its troubles patiently 
and adjusting as best it can to an instability that is difficult 
to overcome and a "war" that no camp seems capable of winning. 
Except by putting the country to fire and the sword.

<F P=106> [Article by Muhammad Fathallah: "Mubarak's Initiatives To </F>
Solve Youth Problems To Be Implemented"] 
  [Text] Implementation of President Mubarak's initiatives to 
resolve youth problems and assume their burdens, by means of the 
Social Development Fund, will begin on 1 May 1994. This process 
will subsidize production opportunities for small projects and 
provide new job opportunities, in order to contribute to a 
solution for the unemployment problem. 
  This was stated by Dr. Husayn al-Jamal, the Social Fund's 
secretary general, who pointed out that the initiatives include 
lowering the interest rates on loans for new youth projects to 9 
percent instead of 10 percent. These are projects financed by 
the Arab Fund, for which the sum of 550 million Egyptian pounds 
has been allocated. So far, 160 million pounds of this amount 
have been used, with 390 million pounds remaining. This is being 
done through five national and private banks. 
  Negotiations are being conducted with the World Bank to 
lower 
the interest rates that are currently being applied to the 
manufacturing community's loans. This rate is currently 10 
percent, with 68 million pounds allocated through three banks. 
About 32 million pounds have been used, benefitting 30,000 
individuals. In an agreement between the fund and the Ministry 
of Social Affairs, it was decided to allocate 1 million pounds 
to establish a joint center, for the purpose of developing 
products, improving their quality, and promoting marketing. 
  The Social Fund's secretary-general added that in view of 
the 
youth's difficulty in obtaining information and determining the 
best investment opportunities within industrial, engineering, 
agricultural, agricultural processing, services, and handicraft 
fields, guidance programs have been prepared for them. This was 
done after it became evident that 80 percent of the projects 
were for the readymade clothes industry, tricot, spinning, and 
weaving. 
  The committee has finished preparing 65 programs, embracing 
land survey, materials, labor, employment expenditures, and the 
economics and profitability of the project. 
  A committee will also be formed, composed of Dr. Muhammad 
Ibrahim Sulayman, the minister of state for new urban 
communities, and Zafir al-Bashri, vice president of the National 
Investment Bank, to draft implementation regulations to transfer 
ownership of units in new cities and urban communities to young 
people at token costs and on long term installment payments of 
up to 30 years, similar to housing projects. 
  Dr. Husayn al-Jamal indicated that the maximum loan for an 
individual project ranges between 35,000 and 50,000 pounds. If 
there are multiple partners, the loan could go to 200,000 
pounds, in order to ensure that it would cover the project's 
costs of purchasing equipment, machinery, and production 
requirements. 
  The secretary-general said that a republican decree has been 
issued to exempt small projects from paying taxes on commercial 
profits during the period of the loan, for a maximum of five 
years. 
  To solve the problems of marketing the products of young 
graduates and craftsmen, the Executive Committee of the Social 
Fund, chaired by Dr. Kamal al-Janzuri, deputy prime minister and 
minister of planning, decided in its recent meeting on a 
strategy of marketing subsidies to end the problems that small 
projects face in participating in local and international 
exhibitions. It was also decided to establish permanent 
exhibitions and create a center of marketing studies for small 
projects. This center would include an information unit, a unit 
for marketing studies and research, and a quality improvement 
unit. 
  An agreement has also been reached with governmental 
organizations to help the youth in marketing their small 
projects' products by giving priority to their purchase.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "How To Obtain Fund Loans; Regional </F>
Offices To Serve You, Secretariat General Awaits You"] 
  [Text] Getting a job is every young person's dream; each 
craftsman should own a productive workshop. Social Fund loans 
are the hope to achieve this dream and security. In order to 
spare young graduates and craftsmen the worry of searching out 
ways to obtain these loans, we shall review both the terms for 
obtaining loans and the documents required. 
  Before going to the Social Fund, one must first define the 
specific type of project that you want to establish and have a 
suitable place available in which to carry it out, either within 
or outside the Cairo Governorate, where the fund's loans are to 
be spent to purchase tools, equipment, and production 
requirements. After that, you go to the Social Development 
Fund's Secretariat General if you are a resident of the 
governorates of Cairo, al-Jizah, al-Fayyum, al-Shariqiyah, or 
Alexandria. 
  If you are from another governorate, you go to the nearest 
Social Fund office subordinate to your governorate. There are 10 
regional offices in Ismailia, which serve the youth of the 
governorates of Ismailia, Port Said, Suez, and North and South 
Sinai. There are also the Shibin al-Kum office, covering 
al-Minufiyah Governorate; the Aswan office to serve the citizens 
of Aswan, Halayib, and Shalatayn; the Qina office to cover the 
Qina and Red Sea Governorates; the al-Mansurah office to serve 
the youth of al-Daqahliyah, Damietta, and Kafr al-Shaykh; the 
Asyut office, covering the Asyut and New Valley Governorates; 
the al-Minya office, serving the young people of al-Minya and 
Bani Suwayf; the Damanhur office, to meet the needs of the youth 
of al-Buhayrah and Musa Matruh; and the Suhaj and Tanta offices, 
serving the young people of the Western Governorate. 
  After going to the fund or a regional office, fill out the 
form pertaining to the project and its economic feasibility. You 
will find someone there to help you enter this data at no charge. 
  After evaluating the study to ascertain the project's 
feasibility by means of the fund, and it is found to be 
acceptable, you will get an official letter to one of the banks 
that are under contract with the fund, according to the 
project's location. This letter will obtain the loan, which 
ranges in value from 35,000 to 50,000 pounds for one individual, 
or 200,000 pounds if there are multiple partners in one project. 
  Interest on the loan is 9 percent on a new project and 12 
percent for an existing one. The loans are disbursed through 
banks, because the Social Fund does not deal with individuals, 
but through responsible intermediate agencies, such as banks, 
businessmen's associations, and national associations. 
  The loan's term is five years, of which one and a half to 
two 
years is a grace period, depending on the project. 
  In order to facilitate the task of searching for a small 
project, the Social Fund has prepared examples of small projects 
ready for implementation for those who are serious about work 
and love craftsmanship. 
  Those who will benefit from the Social Fund's loans include 
proprietors of small projects, graduates of practical institutes 
and colleges, or graduates of theoretical institutes and 
colleges after training, and proprietors of new projects who 
have expertise, as well as workers who will be relocated as a 
result of privatization under the economic reform policy that 
the state is pursuing, and workers returning from abroad. 
  Required documentation includes commercial register, tax 
card, and permit. In order to make it easier for young graduates 
who have new projects, it was decided to issue temporary permits 
when the loans are disbursed.

<F P=106> [Article by Mustafa 'Ali Mahmud, Amirah Khawasik, Salih </F>
al-Fityani, and Mahmud 'Abd-al-Shakur: "What Do Thinkers and 
Scholars of Religion, Politics, and Society Have To Say About 
the Confessions of the Penitent Terrorist?"] 
  [Text] It was the first time people encountered terrorism 
face to face; the first time they heard its voice and saw its 
image. They know the causes and motives for the theft and 
explosion of bombs, and the murder of innocents. Perhaps this 
was the reason the shocking confessions of repentant terrorist 
'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi in front of television cameras aroused such 
wide-ranging reactions among all sectors of the people of all 
walks of life. 
  Despite the fact that these confessions have thrown back the 
curtain to expose the secrets of the terrorist organizations, 
they left question marks in the minds of many--and exclamation 
points, too! 
  To discuss these confessions, and exactly what they mean, 
and 
the extent to which they will help to fight terrorism, we met 
with a large group of intellectuals, thinkers, religious 
scholars, and sociologists, to hear their reactions and draw 
results and lessons from them. 
  To start with, former Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil says 
that 
"the confessions of 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi played a major role in 
enlightening the people, especially the youth, as to what is 
going on in the terrorist groups. There are a number of points 
that caught my attention in these confessions, such as the fact 
that they derive their thought from books, despite the different 
circumstances in which they were written, as is happening in 
Egypt now. There are some who believe that the circulation of 
these books should not be tolerated, that they should be 
confiscated, but my view is different. Books should be produced 
to respond to these, and in an accurate and detailed way, so 
that there may be a discussion of every line and every paragraph 
in these books, because they have become the major germ of 
terrorism. 
  "We must also review the teaching methods in use, and a way 
of instruction that better suits our programs. 
  "We must take into consideration, regarding these groups, 
the 
fact that while in Algeria they have known political targets, 
they are different here. These groups have no clear target, and 
are divided up into small groups, each of which has as its goal 
the gathering of the largest number in order to get more funds 
from abroad. This explains their conflict over leadership, 
because leadership is the source of profit. This requires us to 
have a genuine position, because these funds come from abroad in 
the form of alms and contributions from some fraternal Arab 
countries. This is brazen interference in Egypt's internal 
affairs and we must not allow it. We must take strong measures 
against it, and monitor the movement of these funds in the 
banks, and the persons. When a Saudi Arabian person provides 
these funds, he should be accused and charged, and a verdict 
must be handed down in absentia, with no niceties, and no threat 
to Egypt's security in the name of spreading the Islamic faith. 
As to this talk of unemployment as a cause of terrorism, these 
confessions made it clear that it is false. It revealed that 
those youths found a way to easy money and marriage and easily 
achieved legal opinions, such as those certifying the offficial 
permissibility [of almost any act]. This penitent, 'Adil 
'Abd-al-Baqi, was not unemployed, and his colleagues were not 
unemployed. The link between unemployment with terrorism is an 
attempt on the part of those who sympathize with these groups to 
find an excuse for them. But there is no excuse for them, 
because they are acting to destabilize the government in Egypt 
and to weaken it at home and abroad." 
<H5>  Bats and Phantoms! </H5>
  Prominent writer Tharwat Abazah says, "First of all, the 
Egyptian media have dealt with this talk, and shown it. The 
content of 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi's confessions had been much 
discussed among citizens, but without confirmation like 
marriage, without documentation and legitimization and so on. 
Today, however, it has been confirmed by one of their own, 
indeed by one of their leaders. What pains me, however, is that 
some opposition newspapers are attacking this dialogue because 
he told the truth, and they have been against the truth for 
their whole history. Instead of apologizing for what they have 
perpetrated against our people, they attack the man. I consider 
them to be beyond the pale of the Islamic religion. God will 
judge them. I believe that the government can confront them only 
with arms. As to the dialogue and discussion, it is meaningless. 
We will not engage in dialogue with bats and phantoms. Is there 
anyone who says: `I am a terrorist and I want dialogue?' 
Discussion here is a laughable word. What we have heard from 
'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi needs no discussion--it needs a clash, it 
needs to be confronted with arms and no other means." 
<H5>  Possible and Permissible </H5>
  Liberal Party chief Mustafa Kamil Murad believes that the 
broadcast of the confessions of repentant terrorists--or even of 
convicted nonrepentant terrorists--was absolutely essential. "It 
helps, in the first place, to reveal the secrets of their terror 
networks; second, to help them present their violent, extremist 
ideas; third, and most importantly, to mobilize public opinion 
against terrorism, which targets the security of the nation and 
the safety of its citizens." 
  He reaffirms the importance of dialogue with those 
terrorists 
by all possible means and all available methods. He emphasizes 
the necessity of presenting these dialogues to psychiatrists for 
analysis. In this way, leads could be found that would be of use 
in confronting this dangerous phenomenon. 
  He believes that discussing the terrorists' ideas and 
getting 
to know their tendencies are more important than trying to 
locate the sources of the extremist books the terror groups use 
in formulating their own laws--no matter whether these books are 
printed secretly in Egypt or smuggled in from abroad. "The 
problem must be attacked at its roots. The confrontation here 
must be through dialogue, and dialogue alone." 
<H5>  The Nature of Our Conditions </H5>
  Labor Party leader Engineer Ibrahim Shukri refused to 
comment 
on the confessions of repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi, 
saying that he had not seen them, and so could make no judgment 
on how true the confessions were. 
  He believes that the terror phenomenon in general reflects 
"the nature of the conditions we live in, politically, 
economically, and socially. It is not easy for us to deal with 
the confessions, based on some statements printed here and 
confessions broadcast there." 
  He says that a dialogue is needed with these groups to 
discuss the various views and present all points of view so that 
we can find a genuine way out of the problem, and a decisive 
solution to this dreadful phenomenon. 
<H5>  Just Rumors </H5>
  Yasin Siraj-al-Din, a Wafd Party leader in Cairo, says, "If 
we believe 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi's confessions, in his capacity as 
an actual terrorist, then I believe that they were very 
significant, the more so because they confirm what we have heard 
about terrorist organizations--we used to imagine that they were 
just exaggerated rumors!" 
  He thinks that the media's initiative in spreading this kind 
of awareness is indeed an intelligent one, "especially because 
it comes in the form of the confessions of one of the penitents 
who lived among the terrorists for 17 years. We as men of law 
have this to say: a confession is the best possible evidence." 
  He added that "these confessions are the best means of 
spreading awareness among all sectors of youth, especially those 
who have joined the ranks of violence and terrorism, or those 
who are thinking of joining. Repeating this process with other, 
similar persons will create for us a virtual bulwark against 
violence and extremism for all our citizens, no matter what 
their background." 
<H5>  Willing Tools </H5>
  Assistant Secretary-General of the NPUG [National 
Prrogressive Unionist Grouping] Party Rif'at al-Sa'id says, 
"Apart from the practical value of 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi's 
confessions, and their extensive and decisive effect of broad 
masses of the Egyptian people who listened to them on 
television--the main information medium reaching the broad 
masses of Egypt--they reveal to us two primary truths. How often 
have we voiced them! Many people turned away when we 
voiced them: 

  -  "The first truth is that terrorism begins as an idea. This 
man, according to his own words, never wielded a gun, but he 
made others wield them, and convinced them and taught them to do 
that, and told them that it was a legitimate thing to do. They 
became willing tools in his hands. Thus we discover that the 
real terrorist, committing the greater crime, is the one who 
issues the religious edict. The man courageously acknowledges 
that. Based on this we may reaffirm that we must fight these 
misleading, so-called Islamic ideas, which are opposed to the 
truth of Islam, in the cradle; that is, in the sphere of ideas, 
where they are born. This could mean in the mosque, in the 
education process, or in the media. This is the first truth 
'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi taught us. 
  -  "The second truth is that there is no moderation and no 
extremism in the trend of political Islam, as long as it is born 
as an idea. Those who repeat extremist ideas and all the 
preachers of so-called political Islam, become by necessity 
partners in terror. 'Adil 'Abdal-Baqi has offered us proof not 
only in the relation between ideas and terrorism, but also in 
the field of funding. A lawyer, one of the most famous preachers 
of political defeatism, explained that he was offered a quarter 
of a million pounds. One of the owners of an economic 
Islamization company funds the terrorists directly. Then they 
come to us saying they are against violence. How can we believe 
them? That is the question." 


<H5>    Step By Step </H5>
  Dr. Sa'd-al-Din Ibrahim, professor of Sociopolitics at the 
American University, believes that "the confessions are a new 
model in uncovering the secrets and dynamics of the extremist 
movements' recruitment of adolescents, and their exploitation of 
the adolescents' piety, winning them over step by step to join 
the extremist groups. The new thing that the repentant terrorist 
revealed to us is the organized operations to isolate the 
victims of this recruitment from the mainstream of normal social 
life by creating a rift between them and society. In this way 
they hear no alternative thinking, nothing dfferent from what 
they are being taught. 
  "I might add to that the gradual intensification in the 
doses 
of thought to turn them away from the government and society. 
Estranging them from society makes it easier for the extremist 
organizations to create a rift even between the recruited victim 
and the people closest to him--his family and his friends. It 
ends with the recruited victim become wholly dependent on the 
organization to fill all his psychological, social, and economic 
needs. By magnifying this dependency, the recruited victim 
becomes more blindly obedient to the orders he gets, including 
orders to rob, sabotage, destroy, and murder. 
  "As he commits any of these crimes, he becomes more 
dependent; his personal security is strongly linked to the 
organization's satisfaction with him, and he enters the vicious 
circle. He is more obedient to their orders; with this obedience 
of his, the orders implicate him even more; with his deeper 
involvement, he becomes their prisoner. It is they who hide him 
and protect him. Amid all this the recruited victim's own mind 
is totally cancelled out; he becomes a sort of robot. 
  "In short, what the repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi 
has revealed to us is a physiological Iranian autopsy of a 
journey that began with innocent piety and ended with atrocious 
crimes. It is very important to know all the episodes, steps, 
and details of this journey, for preventing and treating them. 
This is turn must rest on the vital importance of youth being 
able to join the mainstream of public life. If the young want to 
talk politics, let them do it. If they want to talk about 
religion, let them. If they want to get involved in politics, 
religion, or athletics, let them. And in every field in which 
the young get involved, let us ensure and insist that there be 
total pluralism, and plenty of room of argument and debate. 
  "This means that the government should stop fearing 
pluralism 
in the broad sense of the word. All the extremist groups need in 
order to recruit these innocents, is that there be no 
alternatives, active or intellectual, for them to express their 
legitimate needs. 
  "Egyptian emotions and minds must be reopened; the minds, so 
that they can engage in issues of the present and future, and 
the emotions so that they may become more compassionate and 
sympathetic. 
  "The official totalitarian thinking that societies use paves 
the way for another totalitarian idea, opposed to state 
policies. There are many examples of this, chiefly what has 
happened in the former Soviet Union and in Yugoslavia. They went 
from being fierce communists to being even fiercer fascists, 
from leftist totalitarianism to racist and fascist 
totalitarianism." 
<H5>  Useful and Significant </H5>
  Professor of Sociology, Dr. Hasan al-Sa'ati, adds that the 
confessions of the repentant terrorist are useful and 
significant, and that we should emphasize such dialogues in 
order to help correct the mistaken ideas of youth, with which 
these groups tempt them. 
  Dr. Hasan Sa'ati believes it is necessary to take advantage 
of the terrorist's remarks--especially his saying that it was 
economic and social problems that moved him and those like him 
along that road. "The government must work diligently to solve 
the problems of unemployment and intellectual vacuity among 
youth with religious awareness and the sound preaching of 
clerics who have a correct knowledge of religion." 
  Dr. Hasan Sa'ati recommends the confiscation of the books 
and 
memoranda the terrorists use; religious scholars should respond 
to them and refute the glaring errors they contain regarding 
religion and society. 
<H5>  The Return of Debates </H5>
  Dr. Ahmad 'Umar Hashim, president of the Committee on 
Religious Affairs in the People's Assembly and vice rector of 
al-Azhar University, says, "What the young penitent says about 
the absence of preachers is the truth. There is no genuine, 
realistic, systematic, dialogue with the young. Religious 
scholars have not sat down and talked with them, especially 
recently. In the early 1980's, there were serious dialogues in 
which religious scholars such as Dr. Musa Lashin, Dr. Ahmad 
Haykal, Dr. al-Ahmadi Abu-al-Nur, and the late Dr. Mrhammad 
al-Tayyib al-Najjar, took part. These dialogues, initiated by 
Major General Hasan Abu-Basha, bore fruit--I do not know why 
these public debates ceased. Why did they turn into public 
parties to which members of local parties and a large number of 
attendees, who had no wish for dialogue, were invited? The same 
well-known, unchanging people spoke." 
  Dr. 'Umar Hashim says that: "there are books containing 
erroneous ideas, and the publishing of them should stop, and 
they should be corrected. There are other books, which do not 
contain errors, but which are interpreted erroneously by the 
young. The repentant youth read these books with his own 
understanding; but science should be studied with scholars, not 
taken from the newspapers. This was the error for which he was 
responsible. 
  "The lesson to be learned from these confessions is for us 
to 
fill the mosques with qualified teachers; a mosque without a 
qualified teacher would be better off shut down, instead of 
producing erroneous and destructive thought. 
<H5>  Society's Responsibility </H5>
  Prof. Fahmi Huwaydi believes that the youth said, at the 
outset, that he had not found anything in the school curriculum 
that satisfied his wish to acquire knowledge; this was the 
responsibility of the teaching curriculum, which is incapable of 
arming our children with the minimum of knowledge needed to 
protect them from erroneous thinking. He also understood from 
his remarks that the mosques were not carrying out their role in 
creating awareness among youth. The question is: why has this 
happened at this time? 
  He added that the youth spoke of the "caravans of 
consciousness-raising" that imposed their views, and had become 
a failed bureaucratic exercise. He pointed out that the 
unemployed youth had got married and was given a house, which 
confirmed the existence of a social dimension to the problem. 
The fact that the young man said he was ready to die poses an 
important question about who is responsible for giving youths a 
cause for them to defend and for which they would die. 
  Fahmi Huwaydi believes that this statement gives society the 
greater responsibility of creating a national dream and goal for 
youth. Society is responsible for many aspects of this problem, 
such as unemployment, education, and guiding youth, failing to 
give legitimacy to Islamic action, the deterioration of the 
school curriculum, and the attacks on al-Azhar as a religious 
institution, which undermined young people's confidence in its 
scholars. "We must always read these confessions in the context 
of societal self-criticism, not cheering the mistakes of these 
young people or others. We must seek out the true causes of this 
phenomenon. As to books that contain erroneous thinking, they 
are a symptom, not the disease itself, otherwise why did this 
thinking appear at this particular time, when those books have 
been around for years?" 
<H5>  Dialogue With Youth </H5>
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Sabur Shahin believes that "the repentant 
terrorist's confessions are proof of our failure, because we 
have ignored this phenomenon for 17 years. Then this youth comes 
along and redeems himself with his words. What strikes us is 
that we did not do enough talking with these young people 
before they got mixed up in these groups. Perhaps the 
methods that proved dialogue spurious illustrate their 
corruption now. How often we thought we were communicating with 
young people, when we were just fooling ourselves, and 
abandoning them to those people who would estrange them from the 
right path." 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Sabur Shahin defends the role of the mosques, 
asserting that "there were always people there who were 
communicating with the young, but they accused scholars either 
of blasphemy or of being government clerics. What the repentant 
youth said about the lack of a clerical role was an incitement, 
slanderous and false, because the clerics existed, but the young 
people did not want to see them. 
  As to what the youth said about the books he read, this 
confirms--says Dr. 'Abd-al-Sabur Shahin--that, "he did not know 
the contents of truly Islamic books; all he knew were these 
suspect books. I accuse him and others of not having understood 
Ibn-Taymiyah's books, and those of media leaders whom he called 
responsible for lies and ignorance, of having drawn them to 
where they ended up. This is a mistaken idea--dwarfs do not 
compete with imams for stature." 
<H5>  Extending the Invitation </H5>
  Dr. Ahmad Shalabi, professor of Islamic Civilization, says 
that the events cited by the repentant terrorist in his 
confessions have nothing to do with Islam. They only show how 
far these terrorists have strayed from the right 
path--especially what he said about iddat [the waiting period 
prescribed by Islam before a widow or divorcee may remarry], 
even though there are clear and substantial texts that set it 
out. Also, in the procedure for declaring certain things to be 
licit--they set out their own rules for dealing with other 
people, despite the rules Islam has established to protect 
property, blood, and honor. 
  Dr. Ahmad Shalabi emphasizes the need to invite these 
terrorists to return to rationality, and to repent, and to leave 
the wrong path they were following. "Their destructive ideas 
should be confronted with the publication of religious books by 
senior scholars known for their enlightened religious thinking." 
<H5>  The Koran and the Sunnah </H5>
  Prominent writer Sa'd-al-Din Wahbah says that "the young 
man's confessions were not new--information had been leaked from 
terrorists themselves in the past, about the multiplicity of 
wives, without the legal iddat period, plus the legitimacy of 
non-Muslims' money. None of these matters are new. The books he 
talks about, they too are well-known, and everybody reads them. 
The error is that they were not discussed on television and the 
radio and the symposiums of the Ministry of Awqaf. There is 
actually a lack of discussion of the books of al-Mawdudi, 
Ibn-Taymiyah, and Sayyid Qutb. 
  "But if this young man found in these books the one course 
for his Islam, then he must see the error in this, because the 
original and true sources are the Koran and the Sunnah. The 
strange thing is that this young man did not say, in his 
confessions, that he had read the Koran or the traditions of the 
Prophet. Even when he spoke of the legitimizing process, he 
mentioned that he had read a book by Shaykh al-Ghazali, despite 
the fact that the solution to that problem is found in the Koran 
and the Sunnah. Therefore, he is not innocent of deliberately 
misleading himself and others. When he was speaking of his 
return to decency, he said that he had read the story of the 
prophet leaving the money of the Quraysh [tribe] with 'Ali 
Ibn-Abi-Talib. This comes up in many books on the sayings of the 
Prophet, and the Koran--above all--speaks of the custody of 
trusts." 
  "The useful lessons of these confessions," says Sa'd-al-Din 
Wahbah, "are that we should let young people interpret the Koran 
as they choose in schools. We must talk to them. There is also a 
shortcoming in the role of the media, the mosques, and public 
debates in resisting this erroneous ideas held by some young 
people; this young man says that he restored himself 
to the path of good sense." 
<H5>  Not New </H5>
  Prominent broadcaster Amal Fahmi says that what the 
repentant 
terrorist said in his confessions was not new. She had heard it 
before from the families of young men who had broken away from 
society and left their homes for these groups. What was new, was 
that one of the actual members of these groups confirmed the 
extent of error and delusion in the world of these groups. 
  Amal Fahmi adds that dialogue brought up many facts about 
their groupings, the books they used as references and primary 
sources for their religious information; so it was up to the 
Ministry of Awqaf to take control of the smaller mosques and 
religious establishments [the extremists] control, and motivate 
the imams and preachers who have a high degree of enlightened 
Islamic culture so that they can refute the extremists, 
confiscate the books filled with ruinous and destructive ideas 
upon which they rely, and stiffen the punishments for the 
printers that printed them."

<F P=106> [Article by Karam Sinnarah: `Asyut's Terrorism: A Very </F>
Special Case'] 
  [Text] You ask about Asyut? It is an Upper Egyptian society 
that has alternated much between the oppression of historical 
changes and the harshness of geographical realities. 
  There are three sensitive points that must be carefully 
noted 
when you visit Asyut: 

  -  An investigation into the nature of terrorist action there 
confirms that Asyut's terrorism is a very special case. 
  -  A change in the old development program is responsible for 
the 
issuance of harsh laws against the dead--who died years ago! 
  -  A close reading of the results of the parties' role shows 
that 
they define the type of land on which the rising generations 
stand, and the future of the promising generations, and exposes 
the gap between the separate generations. 


    These three points meet in vicious circles, and come close 
enough to meet in a place that was already prepared for high 
temperatures, and tribal conflicts and struggles passed from 
grandfather to father to son. The voice of vengeance still 
prevails as the way to solve most issues. An environment that 
seeks deliberately to hurt itself by spending most of its money 
on purchasing and stockpiling arms. There is pride--great 
pride--taken in owning the greatest number of weapons, and the 
most modern varieties. Extremism paid a visit, and found the 
climate suitable; the worry is that this will be not only a 
visit but a permanent stay! 
  How can the heat been turned down under this smoldering 
society? What levels of development can turn its tendency toward 
hostility into the direction of constructive aspirations? And 
what are the sure ways of delivering it from the evil of 
extremism? Come, let us move in closer to the details of this 
picture, and look for the answers in this report. 
  Asyut is now experiencing the calm after the storm, the 
storm 
of events it experienced before the month of Ramadan, and the 
period following the 'Id al-Fitr [post-Ramadan holiday]. But the 
overworked security forces are trying to consolidate this calm 
with sufficient guarantees so that it will not be affected by 
winds blowing from any direction. 
  Despite the extremist groups' claim that the security forces 
persist in pursuing them and ridding the governorate of them, 
they have adopted a new tactic in carrying out their criminal 
operations: trying to take advantage of the nature of the 
geography in the extremists' areas, far from the commercial 
center of the governorate. 
<H5>  Coca-Cola Vendor </H5>
  The situation did, in fact, turn into something like a 
cat-and-mouse game. The groups contrived new methods of 
disguise. The members carrying out the operations were dressed 
like a variety of persons: a Coca-Cola vendor; a fruit seller; a 
salesman of ready-to-wear apparel who visited houses to sell his 
goods. Sometimes they used the role of a distributor of butane 
gas pipes, and still other methods to find out the addresses of 
the people they were targeting, as well as to complete the 
process of misrepresentation. They also depended on people of 
specific ages, between 14 and 18 years, most of them students, 
to carry out [their operations]. And so young people of this age 
are monitored by the security forces, and arouse the suspicions 
of the citizens of Asyut now, whenever they walk by. On another 
front, the groups carry out their strikes at any hour of the day 
or night, while in past months they were confined to night time. 
They have tried to make their wicked missions successful by 
relying on two factors: the first is belief that they can act 
freely now that a number of senior officers have been 
transferred out of Asyut in the last round of transfers, in the 
belief that the new officers would need time to find out where 
they were active; and the second is their attempt to flee and 
hide within seconds, when they needed, in the topographical 
slopes in the curving range of hills and cane fields surrounded 
by the hills on at least three sides. They also have hide-outs 
in the mountain hollows created by natural formations in 
long-past geological eras. 
<H5>  All These Arms? </H5>
  All these arms and ammunition...where did Asyut get them? 
  Most of the people we asked were as surprised as we were, 
and 
were not generous with straight answers. They did just allow us 
to put our ears to some of the locked doors so that we could 
hear from one of the "chat" sessions that: 

  -  Most of the arms and ammunitions of all types do not come 
from outside the governorate. 
  -  Security forces are sparing no effort to control unlicensed 
arms and infringements of the licensing and confiscation law. 
But within just a day or two after the date of withdrawing arms, 
the violators were obtaining alternative arms by all 
methods. 


    Because of the revengeful atmosphere, some prominent 
citizens 
keep, in their own way, a balance in the quantity and type of 
arms in their families, to keep up with what neighboring 
families have. 
  As to those in the middle, who feel secure that they are not 
condemned by the vengeance of other families, or vice versa, 
they are not averse to selling some of them at high prices, 
regardless of who is doing the buying! 
  We cannot ignore another important point, which is that some 
citizens are hell-bent on revenge; if there happens to be a 
terrorist incident and the relative of one of these is wounded 
by a bullet along with the intended target, and if he knows who 
the terrorist perpetrator was, he only very rarely tells the 
police. Why? Because he believes that if he passes it on, the 
legal measures will take a long time reaching trial and 
punishment. This, he thinks, belittles his honor; it is 
preferable to to keep the identity secret until such time as he 
can take his own revenge in Upper Egyptian style. 
<H5>  Suspicion </H5>
  Security forces have recently expanded their field of 
investigation and suspicion, with the aim of establishing 
control over the movements of terrorist elements and containing 
them no matter where they are. This is now being implemented by 
way of vehicle patrols and permanent and mobile ambushes, 
although the officers involved say their mission is difficult 
and very tough and the stuff of rumors, for many reasons. 
Chiefly, the residents of the historically poorest rural areas 
have never taken much care to register their births, or get 
identification cards. It has reached the point where marriages 
are held publicly and licitly but without official documents for 
a long period. In addition, some fathers hope that by not 
registering the births of their sons they can save them from 
having to perform military service. On top of all this, Upper 
Egyptians by nature have habits and customs grounded on their 
knowledge of others through the family tree, and are always 
angered by anyone whose asks them to produce identification 
cards. 
<H5>  The Gap </H5>
  Are the channels of communication and contact open between 
the university and various other segments of society? Dr. 
Muhammad al-Subayti, vice rector of Asyut University, was the 
first to offer an answer: "We have limited responsibility in 
lecture rooms in all actuality. This has deprived us of 
political representation, even though most of us are natives of 
Asyut, and some are afraid to deal with us, to confirm that we 
will face the bitter truth of the scale of the terrorist tragedy 
and those behind the escalation of extremism. We will announce 
publicly: security requires the cooperation of other parties in 
order for the current wave of terrorism to be overcome. Yet 
these other parties prefer not to appear." 
  The expression "political opportunism" was used early by Dr. 
Muhammad Kamil, Dean of the Faculty of Commerce, indicating that 
the distribution of political roles is not commensurate with the 
level of the governorate have been overwhelmed by influential 
families, including prominent citizens, in view of the fact that 
the majority, which includes numerous intellectuals, found 
itself prevented from playing any role. The majority thus grew 
frustrated. Dr. Kamil believes that this frustration could add a 
new negative dimension to a society in which development has, in 
recent years, strayed from acknowledged standards--thus leading 
to the development of extremism. 
  Professor of Chemistry at Asyut University's Faculty of 
Sciences, Dr. Mahmud Zarif Badr, says, however, that the 
parties' failure to serve the masses, and to take serious action 
to find solutions to problems, led to a serious political 
vaccuum. Had these parties been built on sound foundations, 
bringing together in their ranks models of awareness, and been 
keen on the public interest, they would have succeeded in 
carrying out their mission, and thus helped rid Asyut of the 
evil of extremism. 
  Assistant Professor of Agriculture at Asyut University Dr. 
Ibrahim Faraj points to the fact that the door of political 
participation is closed to professors and intellectuals, helped 
to attract the circle of terrorism to extremist elements among 
the young generation. Especially as interest and follow-up on 
the part of the mosques were late in coming. 
  We asked him: But can't they in turn play a role out of a 
feeling of responsibility? 
  "It is hard to hold awareness, counsel, and guidance 
meetings 
as long as that is not asked of them to avoid misunderstanding!" 
  What of the role of responsibility toward development? 
  "Many commissions visit their committees in the governorate, 
but their course is being limited and their members are asked 
not to have friction with the university." 
  Do you have studies and research in this regard? 
  "Many, and linked to the governorate's situation, but 
unfortunately we send them to specialized authorities, where 
they remain in desk drawers and we get no reply." 
  So, what, in your view, is the reason? 
  "Ask them!" 
  And so... 
  These are the details of the picture in Asyut; more light 
needs to be shed upon it. We need to examine and isolate its 
mingled colors, over and over again, so that we may know which 
one is blurring the picture of stability in the whole 
governorate.

<F P=106> [Article by Fatin 'Abd-al-Razzaq: "What Are Egyptian </F>
Businessmen Abroad Thinking?"] 
  [Text] There has been a constant improvement, in recent 
years, in the investment climate in Egypt. The government has 
now adopted the goal of simplifying procedures. The steps it has 
taken to reform the economy have helped to reaffirm the 
government's policy of encouraging the private sector, with 
investment now registering growth of 15 percent. Although 
figures show that nearly 60 percent of the total volume of 
investments in Egypt were made by Egyptians, and that they own 
853 projects, of which 229 are in the free zones, providing 6.5 
billion [Egyptian] pounds, there is $70 billion in investments 
from Egyptian citizens abroad. In order to attract more assets 
to assist in the country's development, the second conference of 
Egyptian businessmen abroad has been held in Cairo, presided 
over by Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. It was attended by 150 
expatriate Egyptian businessmen residing in Europe, America, and 
the Arab countries. What are the views of these Egyptians, 
absent for long years, on the investment climate? What are their 
thoughts about further encouragement of participation in 
development projects? 
  At the outset, Dr. Mahmud Wahbah, Chairman of the Board of 
the Societies of Egyptian Businessmen Abroad, asserted that the 
investment climate in Egypt was excellent, and that "we are one 
of the world's five most investment-attractive countries, but we 
lack clarity of vision, in the sense of not setting clear and 
specific goals for the type and volume of investment at a given 
time, then setting out to achieve them. And there is another 
negative point: the absence, or nonexistence, of coordination 
among ministries in the area of investment. But I emphasize that 
evolution towards betterment has been a major characteristic in 
recent years, since the first conference of Egyptian businessmen 
living in America was held in Cairo three years ago. The proof 
of that is the establishment of 30 projects for the production 
of textile and fabrics, wood, leather, computers, television 
screens, eyeglasses, and photocopiers. These were all funded in 
full by a group of Egyptians living in America. We also joined 
up with officials to prepare a financial market law, a financial 
leasing law, freeing cotton and selling cotton stocks in foreign 
markets, in cooperation with the New York Cotton Exchange, which 
is the world's only specialized market for dealing in cotton, 
both buying and selling." Mechanic for reforming companies: "Due 
to our confidence in the future of the Egyptian economy, I will 
take part, with a group of Egyptian investors in America, in 
buying some of the business sector firms offered for sale, for 
restructuring. We are, in America, specializing in buying 
faltering companies, then rebuilding their economies, and 
putting them back on the road to success and profit. I am called 
a `mechanic for companies' because I recently bought 10 failing 
companies in various industrializing sectors and returned them 
to profitability." 
<H5>  "For Egypt's Sake" </H5>
  Businesswoman Dr. Zaynab Karam, owner of a medical 
instrument 
and equipment export company in England, who has been outside 
the country for 15 years, said that she was participating for 
the first time in an investment conference, and that she was 
attending out of love for Egypt, and to see what projects could 
be established to serve the citizens of the nation. "They are 
people with integrity among whom I refuse to believe there are 
those who would bear arms against one another or be deceived 
into joining terrorist groups that damage Egypt's reputation. I 
am confident that the terrorist events we are now seeing are 
only fleeting crimes and will stop sooner or later, even if they 
do affect the feelings of some Egyptians abroad; but they do not 
in the least affect our determination to work and invest in our 
country in order to raise the standard of living of Egyptian 
citizens. I call for a greater media effort inside and outside 
Egypt to explain the advantages and guarantees granted to 
investors, both Egyptian and foreign, and to present the success 
that investment companies have achieved in the free zones and 
inside the country." 
<H5>  Evolution of the Financial Market </H5>
  Dr. Wahid al-Mantawi, Egyptian oil expert in the United Arab 
Emirates, says that he and a group of Egyptians working in the 
UAE [United Arab Emirates] established in 1987, "a holding 
company for investing in Egypt. Capitalized at 20 million 
pounds, in the early years of the open-door economic policy it 
faced various bureaucratic and routine problems, which we are 
aware can happen in any country in the world. But we overcame 
the problems and the company achieved a general success in just 
a year, with actual investments in Egypt of 40 million pounds." 
  Turning to his suggestions for encouraging investments, Dr. 
al-Mantawi says that the stock market should be further 
developed and activated, "as a stock market is a key instrument 
for attracting capital. On this front, I seek the granting all 
exemptions for stock investment returns that are granted to 
other deposit facilities." 
<H5>  "Investment Promotion" Needed </H5>
  Dr. Murad al-Damasi, an Egyptian businessman resident in 
Ireland for more than 20 years, has this view of a means for 
attracting the deposits of Egyptians working abroad: "Why 
doesn't the government facilitate the purchase of desert land by 
investors, and grant incentives to reclaim and farm it? If that 
were the case, Egyptians abroad would be able to bring in 
advanced technology and provide a high level of expertise, which 
would supply agricultural products to local markets, plus 
exports. It would bring in national economic revenue, in 
addition to offering job opportunities to citizens. 
  "No one denies that the government has recently offered many 
facilities and incentives to encourage investment, espcially 
with regard to small investors. But we still say that so far 
Egypt has not worked hard enough to promote its available 
investment opportunities abroad and offer each project's 
statements." 
<H5>  "The Problem Is Management" </H5>
  Shakir al-Khayat, an Egyptian businessman living in America, 
and one of the major investors in 6 October City, says that: "We 
have many relative privileges for making great investments in 
Egypt. We can compete with many countries of the world for which 
investment has become very important. The only problem, in my 
view, is management; and then management again. It must be 
developed. Training centers should be set up to graduate 
technical and specialized workers. I'm not saying this in a 
void, but based on my practical experience setting up a factory 
to produce photocopiers and typewriters." 
  Businessman Musa Ahmad Abu-Jabal says, "We have great 
confidence in the Egyptian economy. It has all the elements 
needed for global launch, especially the ability and 
qualifications of Egyptian workers to work with advanced 
technology. We have come to Egypt with open hearts and minds, 
hoping to take part in achieving a better economic future. The 
global changes and political events in the Middle East region, 
after the comprehensive peace, impose a new regional role on 
Egypt. This means that we must all prepare ourselves, as 
Egyptians, to carry out this role at home and abroad." 
<H5>  More Facilitation Measures </H5>
  In the end, AL-AKHBAR met with Dr. Muhi-al-Din al-Gharib, 
president of the executive council of the Investment Commission 
for promoting and attracting Egyptian businessmen residing 
abroad, who have been successful in various investment areas 
throughout the world. He said, "We welcome Egyptian businessmen 
residing abroad. We expect much of them, because we know that 
Egypt can be built only by its own people. We want to convince 
every Egyptian investor to invest in his own country; the 
success of his project is the greatest gain, and the best 
advertisement to attract foreign company owners and investors to 
establish more projects in Egypt." 
  Dr. al-Gharib adds that a number of steps are now being 
taken 
to broaden investment horizons in the near future. Some of these 
are the establishment a number of new industrial zones in 
various governorates in which projects would enjoy tax 
exemptions for 10 years. Investments in them would be limited to 
small and medium-sized, nonpolluting projects. The amount of 
credit earmarked for the expansion of the vocational training 
programs will be increased. Training centers at production sites 
will also be provided. The government welcomes investment in the 
areas of manufacturing investment devices, transport and 
passenger vehicles, and on modern technology projects in the 
electronics, computer, and systems and programming areas. The 
government is also encouraging investors to go into projects 
involving the reclamation and cultivation of large expanses of 
desert land, through leasing. Long-term leasing, of up to 50 
years, would be permitted, and land can be offered now in 
several regions of Egypt. 
  The Investment Commission has also completed a regulation 
for 
the inner work system of the free zones in order to simplify 
measures. It will come into effect in the middle of this year.
