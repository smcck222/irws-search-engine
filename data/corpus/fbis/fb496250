  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Jordan is exerting immense 
efforts to apprehend a Saudi merchant and arms smuggler by the 
name of Nasir Mashhur al-Ruwayli. Al-Ruwayli is considered one 
of the most dangerous drug traffickers and gun smugglers across 
Arab borders. He uses drug smuggling in striking arms deals and 
smuggling these arms to Arab states. 
  It is feared that this smuggler was involved in supplying 
weapons to extremist groups to carry out terrorist acts. 
Members of these groups in Jordan were arrested recently. 
  According to Arab sources, this smuggler is now charged with 
smuggling drugs and arms in many Arab states including Yemen, 
Algeria, and Egypt. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Fighting the Drug Menace"] </F>
  [Text] The three bills relating to narcotics offences which 
the National Assembly adopted on Monday can be taken as a 
reaffirmation of the government's resolve to combat the drug 
menace with renewed vigour. The new laws regularise ordinances 
promulgated by the caretaker government in September last and 
puts new and more powerful weapons in the hands of the 
government with which to fight the evil. One of these provides 
for death penalty and also the confiscation of the assets of 
convicted offenders. The other two remove certain deficiencies 
in the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1930. Knowing the magnitude and 
complexity of the problem, the laws will be welcomed by all 
those who have been demanding more stringent punishment for drug 
traffickers and their minions. While doubts may be entertained 
about how effective a deterrent the death penalty will be, the 
provision relating to the confiscation of assets will surely be 
seen as a potent measure because it is bound to have some 
chastening effect on those criminals who may not be unduly 
averse to the idea of being sent to prison for a year or two but 
who would certainly be deterred by the thought of losing their 
considerable fortunes as a punishment for their drugs-related 
crimes. Doubt will nevertheless persist about the ultimate 
effectiveness of these laws if they are no enforced in the same 
spirit in which they have been enacted. 
  In deterring crime the awareness of the inexorability of the 
course of law is far more important than the severity of 
punishment. This is especially true in this country where most 
laws are rendered impotent by a combination of corruption and 
slothful enforcement. Unfortunately, this is even more true in 
the case of drug-related offences in which the culprits very 
often are influential people or enjoy powerful patronage through 
sheer money-power and influence. The drug barons, who have 
powerful links and lobbies, can dodge the law without much 
difficulty. Therefore, what is of the utmost importance is the 
will to strictly enforce these laws. Only the certainty of 
being caught, tried and punished can instill the necessary fear 
in the hearts of the offenders. 
  The need for a sustained and determined drive to eradicate 
the drug menace is all too apparent. Over two million of 
Pakistan's citizens, including women and youth, are victims of 
heroin and other deadly drugs; the country's image and 
reputation are being tarnished in foreign lands as a producer, 
processor and supplier of different kinds of narcotic drugs. 
The new and reinforced laws should give the government the 
punch and power it needs to get at the purveyors of poison, 
bring them to justice and break the back of their 
well-entrenched operational networks. But the enforcers will 
have to be careful to ensure that the powers are not applied 
only against the pedlars and other small-time operators because 
they can be apprehended more easily than the big fish who really 
control them. If the drug barons, whose identities are not 
unknown to the authorities, are allowed to go scot-free either 
because of negligence or legal lacunae, the purpose of enacting 
stringent laws would be frustrated. 
  The government would also do well to consider integrating 
the 
different laws, said to number about a dozen, under which drug- 
related offenders can be apprehended and punished, into one 
comprehensive and forceful law that would eliminate the 
possibility of any offender, however influential and powerful, 
evading arrest and punishment. Drug enforcement officials would 
welcome such a law in place of the several which now guide their 
activities and which only add to the confusion and hinder 
enforcement. Of equal importance is the need to keep a strict 
watch on the activities and modus operandi of the various groups 
involved in the deadly trade--drug barons, carriers and pushers. 
They are well-organised, have at their disposal huge wealth, 
are spurred by enormous profits from relatively small 
investments and have powerful links and patronage; to facilitate 
their work; they cannot be restrained merely by enacting laws, 
however strict. A totally different approach, backed by 
scientific methods of detection, trailing, intelligence 
gathering, surveillance and so on and, above all, by an 
indomitable will to succeed, is what it takes to win a decisive 
battle against the scourge of drugs.

<F P=106> [Interview with Syrian Vice President Zuhayr Mashariqah by </F>
AL-MUSAWWAR correspondent Sana' al-Sa'id in Syria; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Sa'id] The American campaign against Syria, 
which resulted recently in putting Syria on the list of states 
that have failed to assist in the fight against drugs, is very 
odd. Many believe that it is unfair. How do you view that 
campaign? 
  [Mashariqah] Some elements of the campaign the U.S. 
Administration launched against Syria were undoubtedly unfair. 
It sought to inflict harm on Syria and its policy through 
accusing it of failure to fight drugs. It also aimed to destroy 
Syrian-American relations and put pressure on Syria to dissuade 
it from taking the stance it is assuming on the peace process 
and its fixed principles. That campaign sought also to belittle 
the outcome of the Geneva summit meeting between Presidents 
al-Asad and Clinton and inhibit the impetus it gave to the peace 
process. 
  The manifest fact is that Syria is making efforts in 
cooperation with the Lebanese authorities to fight poppy and 
other drug farming, particularly in the Lebanese area of 
al-Biqa'. Syria has issued many laws to fight drugs, including 
the infliction of the severest punishments on whoever farms, 
manufactures, or smuggles narcotics. Syria's drug-fighting 
efforts seemed very satisfying to the United Nations, as 
represented in the regional committee on fighting drugs, which 
selected Damascus as a venue for its 30th session. The 
committee's representative saw that Syria's drug-fighting 
efforts are worthy of praise. 
  The goal of this campaign is to put pressure on Syria and 
force it to relinquish its solid stance and just issues, which 
were recognized by international legitimacy, that seek to 
establish a just and comprehensive peace in the region. But 
Syria's stance and its just claims cannot be the subject of 
oneupmanship. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Can this campaign be viewed as a sign of pressure 
on Syria, particularly since it was launched just before 
Christopher's tour of the region? 
  [Mashariqah] Putting Syria's name on the list of states that 
fail to fight drugs is merely extortion to drive it to accept 
Israeli conditions in the peace process. Syria always 
reiterates that it rejects extortion and will not tolerate 
oneupmanship when it comes to its basic issues. There is no way 
that Syria will relinquish its rights; it is determined to hold 
on to basic principles concerning Arab rights and claims. 
Pressure will only enhance Syria's insistence on these rights 
and on defending them. All methods and pressure will not 
succeed to force it off its course or make it back down on its 
approach to defend Arab rights and issues. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] A three-week training workshop on drug abuse and 
trafficking ended this morning. The workshop was organized on 5 
April by the Togolese minister for territorial administration 
and security, with technical assistance from the UN Program for 
International Drug Control [UNPIDC]. It was conducted by the 
National Drug Laboratory. Here with the details is Gbode 
Elekonawo: 
  [Elekonawo) The training seminar was attended by about 20 
Togolese security force agents, who were initiated in various 
techniques for identifying illicit drugs. According to the 
organizers, drug enforcement agents often have problems 
identifying the many different kinds of drugs. That is why, as 
part of this assistance project to fight against drug 
trafficking and abuse, the UNPIDC donated identification kits to 
the gendarmerie and the police. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Cristina Codrea: "Romanian Citizens Are </F>
Committing Increasingly More Crimes Abroad"] 
  [Text] The second day of the Interpol Regional European 
Conference examined ways and means to prevent and eliminate 
crime and to improve cooperation among the police forces of the 
member countries. 
  Referring to the subjects discussed at the conference, 
Vasile 
Troneci, head of the National Interpol Bureau, told us: "Since 
1984, Interpol has facilitated the rapid transmission of 
information on cases of international terrorism among member 
countries. Right now, Interpol is paying particular attention 
to money laundering operations, organized crime, and trafficking 
in stolen cars, which have assumed great proportions in Central 
and Eastern Europe. We noted that, with each passing year, 
Romanian citizens are committing increasingly more crimes 
abroad. Last year, 38 Romanians were arrested for drug 
trafficking and five for arms trafficking. Some 980 Romanian 
citizens committed crimes abroad in 1991; their number grew to 
almost 1,500 in 1992 and 2,435 in 1993. Last year, we issued 
international warrants through Interpol for 87 people, of whom 
only 12 were caught and brought home." 
  Vasile Troneci said in conclusion: "On a proposal from 
Germany, a Regional International Police Organization of the 12 
EU countries, called EUROPE, was set up some three to four years 
ago. This body is paying special attention to drug trafficking 
and terrorism cases and is in constant touch with Interpol."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports from 28 April-5 May on antinarcotics 
operations in countries monitored by FBIS London Bureau. 
Sources are given in parentheses at the end of each report. 
<H5>  France </H5>
  French custom officers seized 15 kilos of heroin at Roissy 
airport in two separate seizures on 19 and 26 April. On both 
occasions the drug was hidden in boxes containing scientific 
equipment on its way to Africa. (Paris France-Inter Radio 
Network in French 1200 GMT 3 May 94) 
<H5>  Portugal </H5>
  Police in Portimao arrested seven people and seized about 
270 
doses of heroin, a car, household electric appliances, cameras, 
car radios, hi-fi equipment, watches, money, and gold. The 
operations followed antinarcotics investigations in Western 
Algarve last week. The police believe they have broken up two 
drug trafficking gangs that operated in the region. (Lisbon 
Radio Renascenca in Portuguese to Europe 1400 GMT 4 May 94) 
<H5>  Sweden </H5>
  On 2 May, customs officers in Ystad foiled a smuggling 
attempt by an Iranian arriving from Swinoujscie, Poland carrying 
2 kg of pure opium worth some 3 to 4 million Swedish 
crowns--approximately $370,000 to $500,000. Two days earlier a 
Polish citizen was arrested in Ystad after customs officers 
discovered 10 kg of amphetamines hidden in his car. Both 
smugglers face sentences of at least five years in prison.

  [Excerpts] The drug trade has to accept the failure of 
another billion-schilling deal: In a parking lot along the 
southern highway near Graz, a Pole who had hidden 2 kg of pure 
heroin with a black-market value of 8 million schillings in his 
car was arrested. [passage omitted] 
  Andrzej G., 22, from Poland admitted that he was supposed to 
take the drugs from Poland to Italy. His reward: 1,000 German 
marks. It is currently investigated whether he had already made 
"deliveries" along the way before being arrested.

<F P=106> [Report by Khriso Andoniadhou] </F>
  [Text] Cunning swindlers are establishing companies in 
Cyprus as a public face covering operations to legalize the 
dirty money coming from the smuggling of arms and narcotics, 
organized crime, drugs, and tax evasion. According to I 
SIMERINI's information, the swindlers are using various methods 
and machinations to make their dirty money legal. In their 
efforts they use Cyprus as a transit point. The following is 
their most favored method: First, they choose a country that is 
considered a suitable place for laundering dirty money. This 
country is used as a transit station. The final destinations 
are Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland. The money 
reaching those countries comes from all over the world. 
Afterward, the swindlers choose a tax haven such as Cyprus for 
their "shop windows" and to legalize their dirty money and, in 
this case, acquire the seal of the Republic of Cyprus. 
  An offshore company is registered in Cyprus in line with 
government legislation and Central Bank regulations. The 
company is given a name that is approved by the office of the 
Companies Registrar and an external account is opened with a 
bank to facilitate the export of foreign exchange. 
  Millions, usually in foreign currency, are deposited in the 
bank account while the offshore company issues some 
insignificant capital. Later the company legally exports its 
foreign exchange while it has its name registered in Cyprus. 
  In most cases, the foreign swindlers cooperate with Cypriot 
economic circles, who help them in their transactions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Big Heroin Gang Uncovered"] </F>
  [Text] The National Criminal Police have uncovered a 
Finnish branch of an international heroin gang. The police have 
so far seized a little over 500 grams of heroin. The National 
Criminal Police got on the trail of the gang upon being 
contacted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. 
Customs. 
  Nigerian heroin has been smuggled via Finland to at least 
the 
United States and Germany, but additional Central European 
countries were also mentioned in the preliminary hearing. The 
activity has probably been continuing for at least a full year. 
  According to Criminal Commissioner Jaakko Sonck, it appears 
that the heroin has not been sold in Finland. 
  Police have seized very pure white and brown heroin. Heroin 
of this quality can still be cut before being sold to abusers. 
In Finland the price for heroin on the street is from 2,000 to 
5,000 markkas per gram. 
  Seven Nigerians residing in Finland have been arrested, and 
four of these have been charged on suspicion of aggravated 
narcotics violations.

<F P=106> [Interview with the Federal Government's drug expert, State </F>
Secretary Eduard Lintner, by Holger Wuchold in Bonn; date not 
given: "`When You Have Got the Plague, You Should Not Call For 
Cholera'"] 
  [Text] [Wuchold] What consequences will the legislature 
have to take following the latest hashish ruling by the Federal 
Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe? 
  [Lintner] There are no implications for the legislature. 
The ruling just confirms the existing legal situation--contrary 
to the impression that has generally been created. The right to 
ban hashish has been confirmed, and so has the right of separate 
treatment under the law of alcohol and nicotine on the one hand 
and illegal drugs on the other. The right to intoxication, 
which Mr. Nestovic demanded in his complaint, has been rejected 
by Karlsruhe. It is just that "occasional personal consumption," 
as defined by the Constitutional Court, will not usually be 
prosecuted or punished. This is already laid down in existing 
legislation. Sections of the public have created the impression 
that the court has allowed soft drugs. This is not the case at 
all. 
  [Wuchold] Will this affect the government's drug policy, 
which did not hitherto differentiate between hard and soft drugs? 
  [Lintner] The government's drug policy has been confirmed as 
well. The laender are the ones that will have to take measures. 
The Constitutional Court demands that they work out common 
guidelines for uniform jurisdiction in cases that involve small 
amounts of hashish for occasional personal consumption. 
  [Wuchold] Nicotine and alcohol cause 150,000 deaths each 
year. This figure makes the drugs problem look almost harmless. 
  [Lintner] It is right that the alcohol problem is far 
greater in terms of dimensions. But, whether it is deaths 
caused by alcohol or drugs, they are both catastrophes and 
should not be set off against each other. Calling for cholera 
if you already have the plague in the country would be a 
perverted logic. 
  The conclusion that we have to draw is to step up our 
efforts 
in terms of prevention with regard to all addictive substances. 
The Federal Government is doing this with its campaign "Making 
Children Strong." 
  [Wuchold] One of the arguments for allowing the use of drugs 
has been that this would deprive the drugs mafia of its market. 
  [Lintner] These are very theoretical models that have not 
worked anywhere. Take the Netherlands: The assumption that a 
so-called liberalizing of hashish would separate the markets for 
soft and hard drugs did not prove right. Dealers wanting to 
sell hard drugs will always go where they hope to find 
customers. And potential customers are those who have already 
used drugs. The Federal Constitutional Court has also confirmed 
that hashish is a conditioning drug, since almost all the 
addicts to hard drugs have used hashish or marijuana. 
  [Wuchold] But could allowing soft drugs at least cut down on 
crimes related to obtaining drugs? 
  [Lintner] This is another field where expectations have not 
been met anywhere in the world. This has something to do with 
the fact that, say, a heroin-addict is not able to work. 
Usually he cannot buy his drugs or support himself with a 
regular income. 
  [Wuchold] Has the narcotics problem in the new laender--let 
me put it somewhat cynically--already reached the western level? 
  [Lintner] No, thank goodness, it has not. We do not have a 
comparable drugs scene in the new laender. But there might be a 
similar problem, although this will not happen as quickly as has 
been predicted.

  [Text] Balta Hasan, a 38-year-old Turkish man, who had 
escaped from a Greek prison where he was serving a 15-year 
sentence, has been named as the head of a three-member ring of 
drug dealers broken up by the police yesterday. 
  The drugs were smuggled to Greece through the river Evros by 
a 39-year-old Turkish casino owner, Deniz Ozkan, and were handed 
over to his compatriot, escaped from a Patras prison last 
February. "He was on a five-day leave, as the law provides, but 
he never returned to the jail," Khristos Keramidas, Attiki's 
security police chief, told reporters. 
  A few days ago, officers of the drug squad spotted the 
escaped prisoner in Passalimani, Piraeus. They followed him and 
found out that he was being hidden by a Greek convicted drug 
dealer Khristos Peroutseas, aged 36. The police stormed his 
apartment yesterday and arrested the two men, discovering one 
and a half kilos of heroin.

  Justice and Interior Minister [Juan Alberto] Belloch did not 
agree to his request for additional powers to combat drugs, and 
that is why Garzon decided to resign. 
  At his news conference, he also announced that he is 
resigning his seat as a deputy. In the last elections Garzon 
ran on the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party list in number two 
position, after Felipe Gonzalez.

<H5>  The History of "Dope" in Russia </H5>
  Drug addiction was not something unknown in the former USSR. 
Traditional smoking of narcotics like opium and hashish was a 
common phenomenon in the Asian part of the USSR. But drug 
addiction did not have the character of a mass predilection. The 
situation was somewhat different in the European part. There 
were practically no narcotics like these here. After World War 
II people with a predilection for dope who fought at the front 
used mainly morphine and the similar synthetic drug promedol 
obtained legally and illegally through medical workers. Another 
social environment for drug addiction was the world of art and 
politics, but here the use of morphine was an exception. Among 
representatives of the criminal world hashish and opium were 
more widespread, but users of "dope" enjoyed no respect. It 
should also be noted that both for tsarist Russia and for the 
USSR, epidemic alcoholism was a much greater problem. 
  In a word, the consumption of narcotics was extremely 
limited. It was restricted to drugs stolen from hospitals or 
narcotics of a vegetable origin with primitive processing. This 
situation remained until the end of the 1960's. 
  The explosion of drug consumption in the USSR at the end of 
the 1960's and beginning of the 1970's, from all appearances, 
was linked to the beginning of the low-grade crisis of the 
entire system of socialism (what was subsequently called the 
"time of stagnation") and, as a result, the appearance of the 
para-hippie culture. It seems that disenchantment with the 
previous ideals of society and the lack of new points of 
reference for youth caused a repeat of the outburst of drug 
consumption in the West, albeit 10 years later. 
  The main drug used by youth was marijuana. Russia was 
historically a large supplier of hemp (rope and sacks are made 
from it and boats are caulked with it) and therefore areas 
planted in marijuana are fairly extensive. In practically all 
regions marijuana grows wild over large areas and it is easy to 
find it in the yard of a multistory Moscow building. Southern 
varieties of marijuana are distinguished by a higher content of 
narcotic substance. With the arrival of the hot weather everyone 
wishing to would take trips to regions where it is grown 
(Central Caucasus and Central Asia), crossing police cordons 
without any special problems. With such an expansive area where 
marijuana grows wild as in the USSR it was in principle 
impossible to cut off access to it. Even then there were main 
places of production and routes for transportation of marijuana. 
  After a certain amount of time the increase in the overall 
number of drug addicts brought about an increase in the demand 
for stronger drugs. It was satisfied mainly through theft and 
pilfering from medical institutions. This phenomenon became so 
widespread that in 1974 a number of changes and amendments 
involving drugs were introduced into the criminal code. 
  Synthetic narcotics were practically unknown, and if they 
appeared on the market they were of foreign origin. Exceptions 
were extremely rare. Of the known cases of underground 
laboratories one can note the story of the group of workers of 
the chemical faculty of Moscow University imeni Lomonosov. They 
were set up to produce LSD right there in the university 
laboratory. But it was not commercial production. Much more 
widespread in the area of strong narcotics was the use of 
poppies, which were grown in mass quantities in Ukraine. 
Initially only the milky juice of the head of the poppy was 
used, but the increased consumption made it necessary to use the 
entire plant. The existence of an immense uncontrolled raw 
material base made it possible for any drug addict to acquire 
poppies independently and produce drugs from it. Usually a group 
of several people provided themselves with their own drugs. 
Certain of them sold some of their "product" to their lazier 
colleagues. During those years one could not speak about 
organized crime or a drug mafia. 
  It is known that even at that time the territory of the USSR 
was frequently used for transit of drugs from third countries, 
but there is no available information about the participation of 
Soviet crime groups in this business. 
<H5>  The `Afghan' Myth </H5>
  One of the myths of the Russian history of the drug business 
is the Afghan war. Certain experts have been inclined to regard 
the Afghan war as the main cause of the outbreak of drug 
addiction at the end of the 1980's. But these assumptions are 
not being borne out at the present time. Cases of private use of 
drugs by soldiers of a "limited contingent in Afghanistan" 
existed, but they only show that even then drugs occupied firm 
positions among youth. And the easy access to them in 
Afghanistan and the constant threat only served as the 
background. In fact the outbreak of drug addiction at the 
beginning of the 1970's caused an increase in the raising and 
production of drugs, after approximately 10 years the market was 
flooded, prices dropped, and the overall level of consumption 
rose, which was also the cause of even greater growth. It seems 
that the creation of this myth served as a justification for the 
state's inaction in the sphere of fighting drugs. 
<H5>  The Modern Situation </H5>
  For several years now all more or less serious criminal 
groupings have been shipping drugs into the capital. Even two 
years ago on the territory of the Commonwealth the overall 
circulation of the drug business amounted to tens of billions of 
rubles. This figure can now be multiplied by 100. 
  Recently it has become much easier for criminal groupings to 
gain access to narcotic substances. And there are several 
reasons for this. In the first place, a wave of inexpensive 
narcotics began to enter Russia from neighboring republics. 
There the ruble is quoted much higher than their own currency. 
In the second place, the large-scale attack of crime on society 
has led to a situation where medications containing drugs are 
stolen "indiscriminately" from hospitals and medical warehouses. 
Finally, there has been a sharp increase in the production of 
synthetic narcotics. On the territory of Russia in 1993 Ministry 
of Internal Affairs organs discovered 296 underground 
laboratories that produce various kinds of drugs (twice as many 
as in 1992). More than a third of all the laboratories were 
producing opium, 14 percent--marijuana, 9 percent--amphetamines, 
and 8 percent--hashish. 
  The main kinds of crimes involving drugs in 1993 are 
characterized by the following data (indicated in parentheses 
are the comparisons to the 1992 level): 
  --reported crimes involving narcotic and strong substances, 
53,152 (178 percent); 
  --illegal manufacture, acquisition, storage, shipment, and 
forwarding of narcotic substances without the purpose of 
sale--42,055 (182 percent); 
  --illegal manufacture, acquisition, storage, shipment, and 
forwarding of narcotic substances for the purpose of sale, 
illegal sale of narcotic substances--7,194 (181 percent); 
  --the inclination to use narcotics and strong 
substances--338 
(178 percent); 
  --the organization or maintenance of gathering places for 
the 
consumption of drugs or provision of premises for these 
purposes--449 (154 percent); 
  --illegal planting or raising of plants containing 
narcotics--343 (380 percent). 
  The situation is also complicated by the circumstance that 
the borders with the republics of the former Union today remind 
one of entry yards. Here is a small example. On the Tajik-Afghan 
border the border guards do not keep track of violators so much 
as protect themselves from commandos firing from the other side. 
All the while almost entire caravans with "goods" move into 
Central Asia. From there, naturally, they migrate to the center 
of Russia and even to the West, since they have no place to get 
rid of their drugs in Central Asia. 
  Of course it is not only from Afghanistan that drugs are 
shipped to the black markets of large cities of Russia. If you 
want to you can find both Colombian cocaine and Indian 
buprenorphine here. 
  In principle the picture is most terrifying in Moscow. On 
the 
menu for drug addicts of the capital, 95 percent of the items 
are shipped in and only 5 percent are "their own," synthetic, 
which were manufactured in some kind of underground laboratory. 
Because of the fact that the standard of living in the capital 
is higher than in other cities of Russia (a large number of 
people can buy drugs) and also because of the great surplus of 
narcotic substances on the market and, correspondingly, the low 
prices for them, recently Moscow has become an ideal market for 
the sale of narcotic substances. 
  The capital drug market is controlled mainly by Azeri, 
Chechen, and Dagestani criminal groups. According to militia 
figures, there are more than 150 interregional bands like this 
in the capital today. As a rule, each group is divided into two 
parts: suppliers and dealers. The specialization changes very 
rarely. In 1993 workers of the Department for Combating Illegal 
Circulation of Drugs of the Moscow Militia arrested 2,183 people 
for crimes involving drugs, of whom 141 were adolescents. Many 
of the drug dealers were released on bail of several million 
rubles ($2,000-$3,000), which most likely is not reflected in 
any way in their financial dealings. According to experts of 
militia experts, in Moscow alone more than 500,000 people 
regularly use drugs. 
  Drug prices in Moscow: A matchbox of good hashish costs up 
to 
100,000 rubles [R] ($60), a kind that is almost as good 
("shala")--up to R15,000 ($8), a glass of poppy straw costs 
R20,000 ($15), and synthetic narcotics--$100-$150 a gram. 
  Most of the drug users whose "commodity" is shipped in from 
Ukraine are not rich people. Therefore in order to obtain his 
regular fix the drug addict is prepared to commit practically 
any crime. 
  Moscow is now not only a good sales market but also an 
excellent transit point for exporting drugs abroad. Drugs are 
usually delivered to Moscow from Central Asia and Siberia and 
sent out to countries of Eastern Europe. There are cases when 
drugs from the territory of the former Union also end up in 
certain West European capitals--Paris, Bonn, and Rome. This 
business is intended for immigrants from the Near East, North 
Africa, and...Russia, who prefer the much less expensive 
"commodity" even if it is of lower quality. It is curious that 
these transnational crime groupings are most frequently led by 
domestic drug barons, who have sensibly set themselves up in 
their own offices in those same European capitals.

<F P=106> ["BS-Press" report under rubric "According to Information </F>
From Correspondents and Information Agencies": "Drug Addiction 
in Georgia Is Assuming the Scale of a National Disaster"] 
  [Text] Drug addiction in Georgia is assuming the scale of 
a national disaster, stated Deputy Prime Minister Irakliy 
Menagarishvili at today's conference for the heads of law 
enforcement bodies. According to figures presented by him, 
there are more than 100,000 drug addicts in Georgia and 200,000 
people who are taking narcotic substances; these are principally 
young people aged between 16 and 30. Georgia is facing the 
serious threat of the development of the drugs business. During 
the first quarter of 1994, there were 290 registered cases of 
drugs being smuggled into the republic. According to 
Menagarishvili, the main suppliers of drugs today are 
Azerbaijan, Central Asia, India, Pakistan, and Singapore. 
Moreover, so-called South Ossetia has recently become a 
dangerous center for the narcotics business. The cultivation, 
processing, and sale of raw materials for "impure drugs" has 
become the main source of income for many residents there. 
  According to the deputy prime minister, the solution lies in 
the creation of the corresponding legislative base to combat 
drugs and the drugs business and also a national bureau for the 
struggle against drug addiction and the drugs business attached 
to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and rayon police 
departments. He believes that it is also essential to 
coordinate work in this direction with international services 
that are engaged in the fight against drugs.

  [Text] Up to four drug smugglers are being arrested in 
Tajikistan every day, Deputy Interior Minister Gennadiy Blinov 
said on Wednesday. 
  He said that the number of drug-related offenses since 
January went up by 28 percent compared with the same period last 
year. "The lion's share of drugs is being smuggled via 
Gorno-Badakhshan into Kyrgyzstan and from there, to the whole of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States," Blinov said. 
  As much as 60 kg of raw opium and 100 kg of marijuana was 
seized in the four months to May, or a mere 15-20 percent of 
what is smuggled in, he said. Blinov said Russian border guards 
and troops were also engaged in the drug trade. He put the 
number of such incidents occurring in 1993 at ten. 
  Blinov said that one kg of raw opium fetched an average 
150-160 million rubles on the black market in Moscow--but five 
to eight times cheaper inside Tajikistan. 
  The Interior Ministry is due to start an operation to 
destroy 
illegal poppy plantations in two or three days, he said. 
However, Blinov said the main flow of drugs would come from 
neighboring Afghanistan because it was much cheaper and safer to 
cultivate drug-related plants there than in Tajikistan. 
  In 1993, local police destroyed hemp and poppy crops on an 
area as big as 400 hectare as well as six tonnes of raw opium.

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM, KRIM-TASS correspondent Viktor Kovalenko] </F>
  [Text] Kiev, 7 May--A session of the national coordination 
council for the fight against drug addiction under the Cabinet 
of Ministers of Ukraine was held on 6 May, chaired by Deputy 
Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov. It discussed the problems of 
fighting illegal drug trafficking in Ukraine. 
  The acutely urgent issue of controlling illegal production, 
transportation, sale, and use of narcotic substances in Ukraine, 
as well as problems relating to providing the relevant bodies 
fighting this type of crime with the necessary equipment and 
financing, were discussed with representatives from the 
Ministries of Health, Finances, Internal Affairs, Environmental 
Protection, Education, and other state institutions. 
  It was pointed out at the session, inter alia, that a 
shortage of funds allocated to the law enforcement bodies is 
weakening their actions to seize consignments of narcotics and 
arrest the persons carrying them. It was decided to submit for 
the consideration of the Cabinet of Ministers a proposal to 
allocate, in a separate paragraph in Ukraine's state budget, 
funds to fight the spread of narcotics and drug addiction. 
  Those taking part in the session agreed on the necessity to 
start developing, in conjunction with the Academy of Science of 
Ukraine and the relevant government departments, Ukrainian-built 
equipment to detect narcotic substances during customs 
inspections, and also anesthetizing medical preparations that do 
not induce narcotic dependence.

April ordered the arrest of 21 policemen of the police unit in 
Aucayacu, Tingo Maria Province, on charge of trafficking and 
other irregularities. They were illegally trading 180 kg of 
cocaine paste that had been seized a year ago. (Lima LA

  Interior Ministry intelligent experts have discovered that 
traffickers are testing eight poppy varieties in areas of 
Cajamarca, Upper Huallaga, Huancavelica, Pucallpa, and Ayacucho. 
They are seeking to identify the best variety before planting 
en masse. The experts said two varieties are reportedly doing 
well in Peru and could become profitable for traffickers. (Lima

  [Text] The Paraguayan Government--through the National 
Antidrug Secretariat (Senad)--is coordinating drug enforcement 
in the Southern Cone. This was announced on 6 May by Brigadier 
General Ramon Rosa Rodriguez (retired), the Senad executive 
secretary. He highlighted the key aspects that Argentina, 
Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Bolivia, and our country will consider 
in the fight against trafficking. 
  Rodriguez said: "The first measure we took was to open a 
channel of international communications in the Southern Cone. 
We have thus adopted a positive line of action to 
internationalize the struggle against trafficking." 
  He expounded the plan of action followed by Southern Cone 
countries as of the 12th International Conference on Drug 
Control held in Quito, Ecuador. 
  On that occasion, Rodriguez was elected drug enforcement 
coordinator for the Southern Cone. 
  "We will take positive lines of action. We attended a 
meeting sponsored by the OAS in Mar del Plata [Argentina] three 
months ago and, in my view, the presentations by the different 
representatives were lacking in strength," he said. 
  "It all ended in expressions of goodwill, brotherhood, and 
the like. Now, through the communications channel, we have 
established an action mechanism. Any Southern Cone country will 
now have recourse to another by fax, telephone, or other 
mechanism at hand to ask for help or to exchange information," 
he explained. 
  The plan's second point deals with the furthering of the 
regionalization process by member countries. Rodriguez noted 
that "Southern Cone countries have pledged to participate in 
joint operations at least once a year." 
  "This does not mean that we will work in other countries. 
Each country will pursue an established and coordinated task 
according to its possibilities," he said. 
  Rodriguez added: "We are interested in two things: 
Marijuana, 
our number one problem, and cocaine, which we must combat on 
account of an international commitment. We can now receive 
direct aid--without much red tape--through the communications 
channel. This means that aid must be granted to any country in 
the region that requests it." 
  Another subject Rodriguez broached pertains to the legal 
framework, which in his view, partly favors drug enforcement and 
partly does not. 
  "This is quite a broad subject. The seizure of 2 kg of 
cocaine from some Japanese citizens, who offered police 
personnel a $10,000 bribe and were released by a judge from the 
Caaguazu area after a week in jail, is just one example," he 
noted.

<F P=106> [Report by Samuel Prieto Rodriguez; from the "Early News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Tijuana Judicial Police agents arrested Sergio Ortiz 
Lara, deputy attorney general of the Baja California Government. 
He is being accused of providing support and protection to drug 
traffickers of the so-called Tijuana Cartel. The investigations 
could implicate him in the recent assassination of Federico 
Benitez Lopez, who was public security director in Tijuana. 
  Diego Valadez, attorney general of the republic, reported 
the 
arrest of the deputy attorney general of Baja California, Sergio 
Ortiz Lara, who was charged with association with criminal 
intent, abuse of authority against the administration of 
justice, and assisting in the escape of prisoners. He is 
accused of sheltering drug trafficker Ismael Higuera Guerrero, 
alias El Mayel, who headed the Arellano Felix band in the 3 
March assassination of Alejandro Castaneda, commander of the 
Federal Judicial Police. 
  [Begin Valadez recording] The incidents we have pointed out 
have taken place within a context of violence ranging from the 
confrontation between drug traffickers at Cristine discotheque 
in Puerto Vallarta to the recent murder of the Tijuana public 
security director, Federico Benitez Lopez. [end recording] 
  Diego Valadez said that in this context, in the preliminary 
investigations initiated on 3 March, the authorities must 
determine if the late Benitez Lopez had information that could 
lead to the arrest of Ortiz Lara and other officials in other 
crimes such as possible participation in issuing credentials to 
well-known drug traffickers. As for reports on a possible link 
in this case to the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the 
attorney general of the republic said there is no evidence of 
that.

  [Text] Pakistan's Interior Minister Nasrullah Khan Babar 
and Giorgio Giacomelli, the UN executive under secretary-general 
and chairman of the Anti-Narcotics Committee, were received by 
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani today. 
  At the meeting the president expressed his pleasure with the 
consultation, cooperation, and joint efforts of Iran and 
Pakistan in combatting the cursed phenomenon of narcotics on the 
common border and in the region. He also described as very 
positive the UN's support for the successful implementation of 
joint measures. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to the fact that over the past 
few years the Islamic Republic of Iran has been in the vanguard 
of the fight against contraband narcotics in the region. He 
stressed that the comprehensive fight against the big 
international narcotics gangs, which have advanced facilities 
and equipment, requires the cooperation and coordinated joint 
effort of all neighboring countries. 
  The president said that the venomous propaganda by certain 
Western media, and even some institutes affiliated to the United 
Nations about Iran's efforts to fight the merchants of death 
stems from the infiltration of the world's propaganda centers by 
big international narcotics smuggling gangs. He said: While 
Iran is combatting the merchants of death in the region at great 
expense, certain so-called human rights institutions, with the 
help of their influential propaganda centers, paint Iran's 
humanitarian efforts with the same brush as their own political 
prejudices and describe the execution of narcotics smugglers as 
the execution of political dissidents and a contravention of 
human rights. He said: Iran will not deviate from its chosen 
path despite these allegations. Iran's law enforcement and 
military personnel will fight this cursed phenomenon with 
decisiveness and will support the actions of other countries in 
the matter. 
  At the meeting, the UN executive under secretary-general and 
chairman of the Anti-Narcotics Committee expressed his pleasure 
at Iran's progress in the fight against narcotics. He said: In 
our inspection of the common border between Iran, Pakistan, and 
Afghanistan, I and the team accompanying me saw the diligent 
efforts of Iran's law enforcement forces to combat the narcotics 
smugglers. We will place at the UN's disposal comprehensive 
information on those humanitarian efforts. 
  He added: Iran's efforts in the matter should not only be 
praised by international forums but it should be presented to 
the rest of the world as a model. 
  Supporting the joint efforts of Iran and Pakistan to combat 
narcotics smuggling, he said: There is no doubt that fighting 
this cursed global phenomenon, which causes murder, corrupts 
youngsters, and pollutes the environment requires all-round 
international effort. All other countries, particularly 
regional countries, must use Iran's and Pakistan's joint efforts 
as a model and continue their efforts to combat narcotics 
jointly and comprehensively. 
  Later in the meeting, which was also attended by Interior 
Minister Besharati and a number of our country's law enforcement 
officials, the Pakistani interior minister thanked the Iranian 
authorities for their efforts in the fight against narcotics 
smuggling. He described his talks with his Iranian counterpart 
as very fruitful, and added: We hope that with the measures 
taken to safeguard the common border the fight against narcotics 
and the merchants of death will be continued even more seriously 
in the future.

  [Text] Piracy and drug trafficking pose a growing threat to 
tourists and yachtsmen who once regarded the Caribbean waters as 
a place to get away from it all, say American and European 
officials who monitor the area. 
  Residents of the twin-island Caribbean nation of Antigua and 
Barbuda, visited by thousands of British tourists every year, 
are shocked by the death of two English sailors and an American 
couple, who were found killed three weeks ago and suspect that 
drug traffickers may have been involved. Scotland Yard 
detectives have not discovered the motive for the killings. 
  Drug-running routes criss-cross the Caribbean as the 
traffickers shift their operations and adapt their modes of 
transport in a battle to outwit the authorities. "It's crazy. As 
soon as we are successful in one area they move elsewhere," an 
anti-drug official said. 
  The eastern Caribbean islands of Antigua, Anguilla and St. 
Martin have in recent years become a "preferred area" for 
cocaine smugglers on routes from Colombia to America and Europe, 
said William Mitchell, the American Drug Enforcement 
Administration chief in Puerto Rico. Last year his agency broke 
up a drug operation involving Colombian cocaine which was "air 
dropped" off the coast of Antigua in waterproof "bales." In a 
series of raids, agents seized a tonne of cocaine and arrested 
25 suspects. 
  The murders of four people on a luxury yacht have 
tarnished the image of a carefree holiday destination. Cocaine 
gangs are using the area as a transit zone for the United States 
and European markets. 
  Traffickers normally load the cocaine into waiting "stealth 
boats"--fast low-riding craft that avoid radar detection--and 
carry the drugs to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic from 
where they are taken to America. "We are seeing more and more 
cocaine air-dropped from small planes," said Elliott Richardson, 
the Anguilla police commissioner. "Sometimes our local fishermen 
pick it out of the sea and bring it to us." 
  Drugs are also transported through the area to Britain. One 
man working for an Antigua-based drug smuggler was recently 
arrested as he entered the UK with 66 lbs of cocaine after he 
had carried it by plane from St. Martin to Paris, and on to 
Dover. In November 1992 more than a tonne of cocaine was seized 
on a ship moored on the Thames which has sailed from the Dutch 
island of Aruba off the coast of Venezuela. 
  Drug-running has also increased in the western Caribbean. 
Last year a record two tonnes of marijuana was seized in the 
British Cayman Islands, according to Trevor Cutts, the drugs 
squad superintendent. He said that drugs arrive in the islands 
from Honduras and Jamaica and are transported in smaller loads 
to Florida. He said: "It's like a giant warehouse for the United 
States." He explained that an American naval blockade of Haiti, 
designed to enforce an international embargo and prevent an 
exodus of boat people, may be forcing more drugs towards the 
Caymans, due to extra patrols of U.S. Coast Guard and navy 
vessels off the Haitian coast. Piracy of boats in the Caribbean 
is an added anxiety of sailors. "Many carry guns because of the 
fear of piracy," Mr. Mitchell said. "There's still a certain 
amount of piracy. I'm not talking about Jolly Roger, and the 
patch over the eye. It's almost like carjacking. They don't take 
your car or your boat, but they take everything of value." 
  Local businessmen are worried that piracy and drug 
trafficking could hurt the Caribbean tourism industry, which 
accounts for a higher percentage of national income than in any 
other region of the world. In Antigua there are fears that the 
murders might interfere with the island's sailing regatta in 
April, the Caribbean's top racing event which attracts some of 
the world's finest yachts.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 1 May (NA) -- The Programming and 
Coordination Secretariat for the Prevention of Drug Abuse and 
for the Antinarcotics Struggle today released its annual report, 
which states that "the illegal drug trade has gotten worse in 
recent years." 
  Alberto Lestelle's secretariat reported: "Argentina could 
hardly remain unaffected by the worsening of the problem," as 
"one cannot delude oneself by downplaying the power of these 
organizations, which have considerable advantages over 
government organizations, financial power being one of the main 
ones." 
  It added that exchanging cars stolen in Argentina for drugs 
from Bolivia (cocaine) and Paraguay (marijuana) has "become 
another established criminal activity." The secretariat 
explained that "these two drugs are practically the only ones 
that circulate through and are consumed in Argentina." 
  According to the official report, "the deployment of drug 
trafficking cartels to Latin American Southern Cone countries 
constitutes a regional and national threat which could shortly 
lead to extremely dangerous developments." 
  The reported stated: "As the amount of drugs in transit 
increases, so will local consumption, as illegal operations are 
frequently paid for in drugs which must, therefore, be divided 
into individual doses and sold in the country of transit." 
  The report also warned that "corruption, which is one of the 
inevitable consequences of the drug trade, tends to take 
advantage of Argentina's economic opening and market freedom."

  [Excerpts] The Bolivian Labor Federation [COB] and the 
government reached agreement before dawn today. The only issue 
pending is the approval by the COB plenum meeting of the 
agreement sometime this morning. 
  This means roadblocks will be lifted. This agreement must 
still be approved by the COB, the top-ranking Bolivian union 
central. We hope this decision will be made by noon today. 
Nevertheless, the final agreement was signed before dawn today. 
We will be confirming this report carried by the FIDES and 
JHATA news agencies. The following is a report by Nicolas [not 
further identified]: 
  [Nicholas] COB-government negotiations continue despite 
several stumbling blocks in solving the workers' demands and 
thus end the social conflict. At 1930 yesterday, negotiations 
were suspended and a possible rupture seemed imminent following 
criticism by the executive branch against Coca Farmers leader 
Evo Morales [as heard] who said: 
  [Begin Morales recording] However, [words indistinct] when 
peasants are blocking roads, and workers are fasting and on the 
streets protesting against the government [words indistinct] on 
their day, 1 of May, the president was on vacation. This is all 
very fine, but he should have been heeding the problems of the 
working class on 1 May, Labor Day [passage indistinct] [end 
recording] 
  This term annoyed the executive branch very much. Government 
Minister German Quiroga stated that if Evo Morales did not 
withdraw his statement negotiations would be suspended. This 
prompted a reaction from labor leaders like Mine Workers Union 
leader Edgar Ramirez who said it was another way by the 
government to continue delaying negotiations. 
  [Begin Ramirez recording] The government has all along tried 
to win more time to surely adopt some measures. In the middle 
of an agenda on mining issues, the government suddenly asked 
Comrade Evo Morales to withdraw a statement he made yesterday. 
[end recording] 
  In view of this, the COB plenum summoned for 1500 yesterday 
was suspended until 0900 today. 
  As time passed, amid some confusion, the COB and Evo Morales 
sent a letter to the executive branch in which the coca farmers 
leader excuses himself and explains his statement. [passage 
omitted] 
  The letter was handed to the executive branch. In view of an 
almost unofficial excuse, the COB and the government resumed 
negotiations at 1930 to define some pending issues including the 
approval by coca farmers of the establishment of a ministerial 
committee on coca industrialization. [passage omitted] 
  It is expected the COB plenum meeting will solve the social 
conflict unleashed three weeks ago. 
  [Studio announcer] Here is a report by Jaime Murillo with 
Peasant Leader Felix Santos. The roadblocks must be lifted 
gradually. 
  [Murillo] COB leaders and government officials before dawn 
today signed some important documents. This means that the 
social problem currently affecting the country is about to be 
solved. I will now speak by phone with Felix Santos, a 
high-ranking leader of the National Confederation of Bolivian 
Peasant Workers [CNTCB]. He will give us a more detailed 
report. Good morning. 
  [Santos] Good morning to all Radio Fides listeners. We want 
to explain what is happening to all our comrades and to all 
those who are blocking roads. 
  Today at 0416 we solved all the issues raised by (each 
member 
of) the confederation. In view of this, different CNTCB 
commissions have been dispatched to Chapare, Potosi, Chuquisaca, 
and Santa Cruz. They will be arriving at about 1030 today. 
These commissions have been instructed to inform the local 
CNTCB boards so that they may decide (whether or not to lift) 
roadblocks. A solution will be achieved possibly by noon today. 
This was decided in this last-minute meeting between the COB, 
the government and the CNTCB. Agreement was reached during this 
meeting. However, until this decision is approved we will 
continue the roadblocks. According to reports I have, we will 
be in permanent contact with the grassroots to explain this 
agreement. The grassroots will be contacted to explain this 
agreement and the conflict will be solved. [passage omitted] 
  [Murillo] You have said the CNTCB executive board met after 
signing an agreement with the government. Does this mean the 
peasants support the agreement and the roadblocks will be lifted 
as of noon today? 
  [Santos] This will be done after we have contacted our 
grassroots. We have signed an agreement among coca producers 
and another understanding on the Potosi issue. [passage omitted] 
  Once the grassroots have discussed these agreements, they 
will inform their decision to COB by noon. Meanwhile, the 
roadblocks continue. 
  [Murillo] Have you discussed the deaths of some peasants 
with 
the government? 
  [Santos] Yes, a high-level commission has been established 
to 
investigate these killing and its members will be going to the 
sites later today. The commission comprises representatives 
from the Chamber of Deputies constitutional committee, 
legislators, human rights organizations, [words indistinct], the 
COB, the government minister and the CNTCB. This commission 
will go to Potosi to investigate. [passage omitted]

  [Text] After several weeks of negotiations, the government 
and coca growers have finally reached an agreement. 
  According to coca grower leaders, 80 percent of their 
demands 
will be honored with the signature of the agreements at dawn 
today. It is hoped, however, that these agreements will indeed 
be put into practice. 
  The negotiations with the government have resulted in one 
decree and two ministry resolutions. The decree establishes the 
equal participation of coca growers in the National Development 
Fund, Fonaral. One of the resolutions provides for the 
compulsory eradication only of new plantations; the second 
resolution, to be implemented immediately, provides for the open 
marketing and industrialization of coca leaf. The peasants, in 
exchange, have agreed to lift the road blockades. [recorded 
passage indistinct] 
  This morning the coca grower leaders travelled to El Chapare 
and the coca production areas to announce the agreement reached 
with the government and to suspend the pressure tactics, such as 
road blockades, adopted by the peasants.

  [Text] Yesterday President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada said 
that the DEA works and must continue to work in a coordinated 
manner with the national institutions and abiding by the 
Bolivian laws. 
  In response to the concern expressed by several sectors 
regarding the alleged interference by foreign agents or 
organizations in domestic affairs, the president explained: "We 
are getting the DEA to work in a coordinated manner with the 
Bolivian institutions, abiding by the national laws." 
  The chief of state said that at a personal and diplomatic 
level he clearly stated that the orders must come from Bolivia, 
as we are waging a great joint struggle against drug trafficking 
and for this need U.S. support. 
  The president said: "We need U.S. assistance, but it should 
be granted within a framework of mutual respect and the 
effectiveness that stems from adequate coordination." 
  In Sanchez de Lozada's opinion, the DEA has heard the 
criticisms from various sectors of the country, and he believes 
it has understood the rules of the game. 
  He stated, however, that as a result of these criticisms he 
is not going to adopt a chauvinist attitude nor seek to easily 
gain popularity by criticizing the United States for what has 
happened. 
  The DEA's work in Bolivia is being questioned by political 
and social sectors, among them the Church, which believe that 
the DEA is violating Bolivian sovereignty. 
  U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia Charles Bower was the first U.S. 
Government authority to answer these expressions of concern, 
stating that there are no signs of interference in domestic 
affairs.

  [Text] ANF -- At an international antinarcotics conference 
that has been under way in Quito, Ecuador, since last week, 
Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz said that the Colombian 
cartels, and mainly the Cali cartel, are establishing themselves 
in Bolivia to produce cocaine on a large scale. 
  "We could be facing the imminent and increasing transfer of 
foreign criminal drug organizations to Bolivia," said Soliz, in 
a speech before the 12th International Drug Enforcement 
Conference (IDEC). 
  He said that the drug trafficking organizations, and 
especially those from Colombia, are able to subjugate the most 
important indigenous organizations in gaining control over the 
entire drug circuit, from producing coca to cocaine paste, 
refined cocaine, and the export and marketing of pure cocaine. 
  He added: "The Colombian drug rings hope to establish their 
own supply system for the chemicals they need, as it is known 
that they want to complete the circuit by refining their own 
production." 
  Soliz said that to estimate the presence of illegal 
chemicals 
in Bolivian territory "is a frightening exercise, as the huge 
border regions shared with our neighbors are the natural habitat 
for unique species of animals and plants, with rivers full of an 
impressive variety of fish, and with fertile land suitable for 
all manner of cultivation." 
  Soliz added: "This entire habitat where ancient ethnic 
groups live, forming a natural ecosystem, alive and without 
contamination, is now in danger due to the voracity of drug 
traffickers and their suppliers of chemicals."

  [Text] Cochabamba, 19 Apr (PRESENCIA) -- The increasing use 
of drugs is converting Bolivia from a producing country to a 
consuming country because "drug addiction is unfortunately 
consolidating itself in the country." 
  This comment was made by Rolando Camacho Pena, director of 
the Council for the Comprehensive Prevention of Drug Abuse, 
Treatment, and Rehabilitation, Copre. He stated that drug 
addiction affects students in particular. He said: "For this 
reason the greatest part of our effort and work is directed 
toward that section of the population." 
  He reported that in 1990 a study was made on drug 
consumption 
among high school and university freshmen students. The study 
revealed that the national average was 12.82 percent and that 
the most affected departments were Santa Cruz and Cochabamba 
with 16.39 and 16.35 percent respectively. He said: "This leads 
to the conclusion that the prevention program at the school 
level must be strengthened." The first Copre publication on 
epidemiological studies explains drug addiction trends and 
behavior patterns. 
  Camacho said: "Unfortunately the trend shows that drug 
addiction among students is increasing. This means students are 
consuming more drugs, they are more involved in drug 
consumption." 
  The study conducted by the Bolivian Red Cross in 1986 showed 
that drug addiction was 10.32 percent. This increased to 12.82 
percent in 1992. Habitual consumption [consumo habitual] 
increased from 1.6 to 2.65 percent from 1986 to 1990. Camacho 
added: "The problem is constantly increasing." 
  Camacho indicated that the studies will now be conducted 
every two years because "the problem is so serious that we need 
to study addiction trends and be alert for a possible epidemic 
that could have catastrophic consequences for our students." 
  The drugs that are consumed most include the so-called legal 
drugs--alcohol and tobacco--which form "a bridge" to the use of 
other illegal drugs like cocaine and marijuana "which seriously 
affect the health of the young."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Money `Laundering' in Bolivia"] </F>
  [Text] Whether we like it or not, the laundering of 
dollars, national currency, or any foreign currency is not a 
crime in Bolivia. To be a crime it would have to be 
specifically described as "antijuridical conduct" either in the 
Penal Code or in a law such as the frightful and now repudiated 
Law 1008. Oddly enough, neither those in the U.S. Embassy nor 
their Bolivian counterparts who implement draconian measures 
included such conduct in that law, and therefore it is not 
characterized as a crime. 
  Perhaps the reason for this is the fact that the 
"laundering," which is also called "whitewashing," is impossible 
to keep under control in a financial and monetary system like 
ours, where there are no restrictions for converting our 
currency, or where no question is asked about who makes deposits 
or withdrawals in bank accounts for any type of currency. The 
other ways of finding out (through legal means, and not through 
intimidation, blackmail, or physical or psychological torture) 
if a transaction is voluntarily linked to a crime are also 
impossible. For example, how can you incriminate the apostolic 
vicariate in a Santa Cruz Province that 10 years ago sold a 
cattle ranch in its ownership to an individual who is now being 
accused of drug trafficking? 
  There are many examples, and the introduction of controls to 
prevent the undesirable laundering can do nothing more than 
obstruct the normal flow of financial operations. What Law 1008 
in reality establishes is the investigation of wealth, and in 
this way trace whether an individual accumulated wealth through 
illegal activities such as drug trafficking. This should be 
extended to other individuals to find out whether there were 
cases of embezzlement or corruption in the public administration.

  [Text] If it is left up to the Military Police [PM] to 
investigate the connections between the illegal numbers lottery 
and international drug trafficking, District Attorney Antonio 
Carlos Biscaia may become frustrated. The investigations have 
stopped and, according to sources from the PM Secret Service 
(P-2), anyone who insists on investigating on his own could be 
punished. Authorizations for cars and agents necessary for 
operations that must be carried out in Bangu, Campos, and Angra 
dos Reis--where there is a strong indication of links between 
illegal lottery kingpins and drug traffickers--have been 
canceled. 
  Biscaia, who does not trust the civilian police, is unable 
to 
investigate any charges of drug trafficking links due to lack of 
support from the PM. The P-2 agents have not even analyzed a 
telephone book confiscated in an illegal lottery kingpin's home 
in Praca da Se, Bangu, which contains telephone numbers of the 
Cali cartel in Colombia, the main drug trafficking cartel in the 
world. According to secret service sources, the PM alleges that 
such operations are meant to politically harm former Rio de 
Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola and current Governor Nilo 
Batista. 
  The information leaked by an accountant for illegal lottery 
kingpin Castor de Andrade to the PM secret service--which links 
Fernando de Miranda Iggnacio, Andrade's son-in-law, who is 
detained at a Polinter [Inter-State Police] precinct, with 
Colombian drug traffickers--could also not be confirmed, because 
the P-2, with the dismissal of Lieutenant Colonel Marco Antonio 
Paes de Oliveira, has practically been dismantled. The most 
active P-2 agents were transferred to other units or given 
anticipated vacations. 
  According to the same sources, any evidence of the links 
between the illegal lottery and drug trafficking could 
strengthen the district attorney's position and, on the other 
hand, weaken the state government and PDT [Democratic Labor 
Party] politicians mentioned in the lists of the illegal lottery 
kingpins. 
  To worsen the situation, the Federal Police is on strike, 
and 
the information about passport numbers, and arrivals and 
departures from the country, cannot be checked out, not even by 
the prosecutors. For this reason, and to gain time, Biscaia is 
concentrating on the charges of active and passive corruption 
which require only the analysis of computer diskettes and 
accounting books confiscated from the illegal lottery kingpins, 
and which list the names of politicians, prosecutors, judges, 
journalists, artists, and athletes.

<F P=106> [Article by Merete Reinholdt: "Drugs Are Democracy's Worst </F>
Enemy"] 
  [Excerpts] The drug problem cannot be solved by giving more 
money to the police. According to Raymond Kendall, director of 
Interpol, the politicians could better use the money for 
prevention and treatment. 
  Denmark will not be able to avoid corruption at the top if 
European drug policy continues as it has up until now. Giving 
more money to the police is just putting a Band-Aid on a disease 
that needs to be cured at its roots, through prevention and 
treatment, before the European democracies ultimately succumb to 
drug crime. 
  This is the opinion of General Secretary Kendall, whose 
unconventional opinions have set many to thinking. He has 
perhaps even succeeded--however slightly--in helping to change 
the lawmakers' conception of the drug problem. In any case, the 
debate can be heard all over the Western world. The Danish 
government's recently proposed drug initiative is only one of 
many European measures. 
  "The connection between the drug trade and organized crime 
means that today the two types of criminal activity cannot be 
easily separated from one another. Drug profits have risen so 
steeply that corruption in itself is a significant concern. We 
can see it in industrialized countries such as Italy and in 
southern France. I am certain that even in Denmark and Great 
Britain opportunities for corrupting highly placed officials 
present themselves more frequently than ever before.'' 
  ``When I say this, it is in order to make the politicians 
understand how serious the problem is they are confronting. It 
is not just a question of the rise in drug abuse, which is 
serious enough, but also the danger organized crime poses to our 
society. The drug trade is an attack on our democracy and 
economy,'' said Kendall. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Shortsighted </H5>
  "More than 60 percent of all crime is connected with the 
drug 
trade. This increase has occurred during the last 20 years. In 
1974, Europe did not have a real drug problem, although there 
was naturally a small number of drug addicts in every country. 
Great Britain had, for example, about 150 confirmed drug 
addicts. At that time, the biggest problem in Europe was the 
`French Connection,' the group in southern France that produced 
designer drugs primarily for drug users in the United States. 
But a mere 20 years later the situation has reached a point 
where a critical drug situation is found not only in the 
capitals but in all the larger European cities.'' 
  ``This has happened because in the beginning we believed the 
problem belonged to others. We focused our energies on 
pressuring the countries who produced the drugs, offering them 
assistance in eliminating drug manufacturing, etc. Next, we 
expended our resources on building up our own effective 
narcotics police force. At no time did we seriously attempt to 
reduce the demand for drugs in our own countries. As a result, 
consumption rose drastically. Because drugs were not seen as a 
serious problem, production and demand soared.'' 
  Kendall blamed European politicians for this. Even though 
some politicians have been inclined in recent years to 
acknowledge the danger signs, efforts to tackle the drug 
question have not been adequate. 
  "Politicians first adopt a stance on an issue when the 
problem has already reached alarming proportions, and then it is 
often too late. Eventually they comprehend the seriousness of 
the problem and they discover that their expectations of beating 
the problem at home by stopping production in other countries 
are not realistic. The problem cannot be disposed of in this 
way. It simply crops up in a new place, as may be appreciated by 
the fact that a number of the former Soviet states, such as 
Kazakhstan and Tajikistan, have now become centers of drug 
production.'' 
  ``Unfortunately, it takes a long time before social 
assistance programs show results and therefore they cost a lot 
of money. Thus the tendency has always been to give more money 
to the police. This means that we arrest more people and seize 
more drugs. Results like these count more in the eyes of 
politicians whose perspective on the future stretches only three 
to five years into the future--until the next election. In the 
current economic crisis, politicians do not like to spend large 
sums of money on preventive measures that will not yield results 
for many years. Whereas anything that will yield results before 
the next election is OK.'' 
  ``However, they are not tackling the real problem. 
Increasing 
police strength does not reduce the demand for drugs. As long as 
we do nothing about demand, none of our other efforts will have 
any effect. We are going to have to recognize just how enormous 
the problem really is. It has reached proportions where 50 to 60 
percent of our budget goes to security measures and other items 
that directly or indirectly relate to drugs.'' 
<H5>  Toward Liberalization </H5>
  The growing disposition for a more preventive approach, is 
thwarted in part, Kendall feels, by the debate over the 
liberalization of drug policy. He has recently been quoted--in 
Denmark by Justice Minister Erling Olsen--as favoring an overall 
decriminalization of drugs. But this is due to a poor 
translation of a French interview by the English-speaking press, 
he explained to this interviewer. 
  "What I said was that decriminalization of drugs should be 
considered with the consumers in mind. There is no point in the 
police arresting people who have drugs intended for personal use 
in their possession. It is quite another matter in the case of 
dealers, on whom we must come down hard. What purpose is there 
in ensnaring an addict in the justice system and sending him to 
jail where he risks falling in with an even more criminal 
element, when our resources do not even permit us to investigate 
every single case?'' 
  ``Even so, it should be prohibited to sell drugs. Only in 
creating barriers to the use of drugs do we have a hope of 
inducing people to go into preventive treatment programs. They 
will hardly do so voluntarily. Deeply dependent addicts, 
whatever their desire to throw off their addiction, are not 
capable of taking the initiative themselves. They must be forced 
into it. Therefore the leverage to send them to a treatment 
facility once they violate the law has to be retained. This 
requires that treatment facilities be built and treatment 
programs set up. The problem today is that these facilities do 
not exist. Preventive approaches have been left to the private 
humanitarian organizations, volunteer assistance groups, and 
other nongovernmental agencies who have been allocated some 
minor economic funding. That cannot be called a serious effort.'' 
  ``On behalf of Interpol, I speak out against the 
liberalization of drugs. We must act pragmatically and 
realistically. It is not realistic to believe the drug problem 
can be solved through liberalization. In the first place, it 
would be very difficult to do. Which drugs should be 
decriminalized, what quantities should be permitted to 
individuals, how should they be distributed, and what age limit 
should there be? If drugs were decriminalized, there would be 
even more ways to become addicted and the problem would end up 
bigger than it already is.'' [passage omitted] 
  Kendall added that it is meaningless to make a distinction 
between hard and soft drugs or to argue that hashish, at least, 
should be decriminalized. He called this type of argumentation a 
"smoke screen," inasmuch as all drugs are harmful. Society, he 
insisted, would create still more problems for itself if hash 
were made legal. 
  "Furthermore, it is an oversimplification of the issue to 
maintain that drug crime can be eliminated simply by 
decriminalizing drugs. Twenty years ago, the traditional 
organized criminal groups were Mafia who made their money in 
prostitution, casinos, weapons, and so forth. So even in a 
future in which there were no drugs, the organized criminal 
groups would continue to make money in one way or another. Maybe 
they would make less, but they would make something. In the last 
20 years, however, organized crime has changed its financial 
methods. Becoming involved in the drug trade has also made it 
easier for criminal leaders to engage in corruption at very high 
levels of our society," he said. Kendall was formerly a police 
inspector in Scotland Yard's narcotics division before coming to 
Interpol in 1971 to serve as, among other things, director of 
the narcotics division. Since 1985 he has occupied the top 
position in the organization, the first person who was not 
French to do so. 
<H5>  Weapons and Drugs </H5>
  Increasingly, trade in weapons and drugs go hand in hand. 
The 
embargo in Bosnia has opened up the illegal trade in weapons, 
which is chiefly financed by drug money. The same is true in 
Kurdistan and many other places, Kendall said. 
  "Many of the countries who formerly assisted terrorist 
groups in such things as selling weapons in local conflicts 
around the world no longer do that. This means that these groups 
must go out and find other economic sources. The drug trade is a 
relatively easy way to earn quick money. It is easier than, for 
example, robbing a bank." 
  Kendall returned to prevention campaigns as a solution to a 
substantial part of the drug problem. If it is possible through 
informational campaigns to persuade the new generation to stay 
away from both hard and soft drugs, it will affect the whole 
drug network adversely, with economic consequences for 
ringleaders and middlemen. 
  "Politicians' new awareness can be attributed, on the one 
hand, to the link between AIDS and needle users, and on the 
other hand, to the ill effects the problem has brought with it. 
First of all, it impacts our economic situation. But more 
critically, many jobless young people find it harder and harder 
to find any meaning in their future and are, as a result, 
particularly vulnerable to falling into drug dependency. The 
quantity of drugs on the market will not diminish. Heroin, 
opium, and cannabis are being sold as always, while the sale of 
artificial stimulants is on the rise.'' 
  ``Yet, with the proper preventive programs it is possible to 
see results in the future. Compare it with smoking, which has 
fallen dramatically on the basis of antismoking campaigns. Or 
with the drop in the use of hard liquor around the world. These 
things prove to me that the general public is reasonably 
intelligent, when the right information is fed to them. But you 
have to be clear about one thing: We will never entirely be rid 
of drug abuse, we can merely reduce the extent of it.'' 
  Without wishing to single out any particular country for its 
drug policy, Kendall is nevertheless impressed with Sweden, 
which uses more resources per capita on prevention and treatment 
than any other country in the world. The United States is next, 
while the European nations in general do not reap much praise 
from the general secretary, both because they put too little 
money into the problem and because too many places are 
mindlessly using methadone as a treatment without attempting to 
lower consumption. 
  "When people talk about methadone treatment as a solution to 
the problem of drug addiction they are getting things mixed up. 
In my opinion, the only people who have the right and the 
knowledge to express themselves on methods of treatment are 
doctors and addicts. Whether methadone should or should not be 
used in treatment is not within my expertise, nor should it be a 
matter of political contention.'' 
  ``The fact that Switzerland is now experimenting with 
controlled dispensing of heroin is, in my opinion, a courageous 
attempt. I believe this type of solution needs to be tried. Of 
course, one could say that dispensing drugs by prescription is a 
type of liberalization, but I do not agree with that. One should 
bear in mind that it is against the law to take drugs. However, 
in the beginning, in order to solve the big problems, it is 
necessary to introduce an interim type of liberalization. But it 
must not be legalized so that you and I begin to take the 
stuff.'' 
  Despite the measures that are slowly taking hold in Europe, 
Kendall does not see much light in the future. It is far from 
enough, and good intentions will not bring much change. 
  "I am not optimistic. In the present economic situation, 
initiatives are being proposed for which there is no money and 
which will never therefore be implemented. I am not optimistic."

  [Text] With a decision that caught most government 
officials by surprise, President Carlos Menem yesterday decided 
to group the Federal Police, the Coast Guard, and the Border 
Police, that is, the entire state security apparatus, under a 
future Secretariat for State Security [Secretaria de Seguridad 
del Estado]. Menem chose Julian Licastro, a retired Army 
lieutenant with a long career within the Peronist party, to head 
this supersecretariat (it might also include management of the 
Secretariat for State Intelligence, SIDE). 
  In designing the new secretariat's structure Menem did not 
seem to realize some details: The future secretariat undermines 
the powers of the Defense Ministry and Interior Ministry. 
  When the news had already spread outside the presidential 
office, the government was forced to issue a press communique in 
an attempt to calm the internal discussion prompted by the 
proposal. 
  Some government officials attributed this initiative to 
[Economy Minister] Domingo Cavallo's team. One of Cavallo's 
team members even told CLARIN that on 8 May Licastro met the 
economy minister. In an attempt to explain Cavallo's alleged 
meddling in this issue, the source noted: "The management of 
the about $2.6 billion that is spent on security is involved." 
  The official communique was issued late after the reports 
had 
already astonished SIDE, Defense Ministry, and Interior Ministry 
officials. SIDE, the Defense Ministry, and the Interior 
Ministry had been dealing with pieces of rumors, prompting an 
atmosphere of bewilderment and irritation. This atmosphere 
spread to the security forces involved. 
  To soothe the irritation, but raising more questions, the 
press communique's first paragraph notes: "As it is necessary 
to achieve an effective coordination among the various security 
forces involved in the protection of public property and in the 
struggle against crime and drug trafficking, the president of 
the nation has given instructions to the interior and defense 
ministers to study the formation of a State Secretariat for 
Interior Security [Secretaria de Estado de Seguridad Interior]." 
<H5>  Social Violence </H5>
  Nevertheless, the communique did not manage to clear other 
doubts: Would the Drug Enforcement Secretariat, headed by 
Alberto Lestelle, also be included in the same package? Will 
SIDE, as had initially been indicated, be included or not? Will 
this be the organization to command the Rapid Deployment Units 
that are being planned to repress social disorders that 
overwhelm the provincial police? It seemed that no one at 
Government House last night had any response to these issues. 
  The official communique's belated caution, with 
announcements 
such as "to study the formation of" or "to plan the new 
organization's operational structure," was prompted after those 
who have the structure established by the Interior Security Law 
at their fingertips went to the Government House to caution 
about the legal and political challenges that will undoubtedly 
be raised by various circles, including the security forces 
themselves. 
  This issue will be discussed during a cabinet meeting at the 
Olivos presidential residence. Menem's proposal seeks to group 
military units, intelligence activities, and drug enforcement 
forces under a single head. This disagrees with the spirit and 
provisions of a law agreed upon between Peronists and Radicals, 
who also make up a Bicameral Monitoring Committee that was also 
not consulted before taking this step. 
  Nevertheless, an official involved in drawing up legal 
standards and decrees guaranteed to CLARIN that a presidential 
decree alone would be required to establish the new secretariat. 
This official, however, emphasized that such a presidential 
decree has not yet been drawn up, and that Licastro has not yet 
been appointed as secretary. 
  The source actually noted that in order to establish a 
secretariat of such characteristics, the Interior 
Undersecretariat headed by Hugo Franco would be dissolved and at 
least the status of SIDE would be changed.

  [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (AFP) -- President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Losada spoke on Thursday [date not further specified] of the 
danger of a "narco-guerrilla" and powerful drug cartels like 
those of Colombia developing in Bolivia if a general drug 
enforcement policy is not quickly defined. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said that this new policy, which he will 
present to Congress next August, must not be imposed from 
abroad. He said this to a local newspaper, alluding to the 
problems created in Bolivia by U.S. pressure to radicalize drug 
enforcement and to eradicate coca plantations in El Chapare, the 
largest cocaine raw material producing zone in the world. 
  The chief of state said: "Trafficking is a very serious 
problem for all sectors of society and it affects Bolivian 
relations with the rest of the world." 
  The president said he was worried about the lack of a 
consistent drug enforcement strategy. He stated that most of 
the coca produced in El Chapare--approximately 60,000 tonnes per 
year--ends up in drug production. 
  "Nobody chews coca in El Chapare; coca produced in Yungas 
region is taken to El Chapare, and all goes to produce drugs. 
The atmosphere in the region favors the establishment of drug 
cartels or narco-guerrillas," Sanchez de Lozada said. 
  Regarding the policy being prepared by his administration, 
Sanchez de Lozada mentioned the creation of a National Drug 
Enforcement Council [Consejo Nacional de Lucha Contra el 
Narcotrafico] presided by Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar and 
comprising Justice Minister Jorge Blattman, Sustainable 
Development Minister Guillermo Justiniano, and Minister of 
Government German Quiroga. 
  This council must find solutions in Bolivia and not 
solutions 
imposed from abroad, the president said, adding that this 
reorganization includes defining a policy toward the United 
States. 
  "This is far too important for them (the United States) 
because after many years they have recognized the need for 
shared responsibility. It is our obligation to generate a 
proposal that will really solve this problem," Sanchez de Lozada 
said.

  [Text] La Paz -- The Armed Forces general staff is 
assessing a series of state intelligence and security reports 
suggesting that Chapare, in Cochabamba Department, be declared a 
"military zone" taking into account that a series of factors in 
the region could place the country's political and social 
stability at stake. 
  The reports state that the presence of individuals linked to 
terrorism has been detected in this tropical region of 
Cochabamba. It is even suspected that they may have some 
relationship with subversive groups operating in Peru, also 
precisely in coca production areas, such as Upper Huallaga, 
which has characteristics similar to those of Chapare. 
  The reports mention, moreover, that the presence of drug 
traffickers that have come into Bolivia from Colombia has been 
detected. These traffickers are allegedly inciting the peasants 
to oppose the implementation of programs to eradicate surplus 
coca plantations, through demonstrations that recently almost 
resulted in violent clashes. 
  According to the intelligence report submitted to the Armed 
Forces high command suggesting that Chapare be declared a 
military zone, these and other factors detected in the area 
represent a worrisome prospect. National institutions must work 
to prevent the unleashing of conflictive situations that could 
place internal security and the country's sociopolitical 
stability at stake. 
  Moreover, military sources who asked not to be identified 
stated that high-ranking government echelons are concerned over 
the existence of acts of sabotage against the alternative 
development program. This seriously affects the country as a 
whole regarding the fulfillment of bilateral agreements with the 
United States. 
  The Bolivian and U.S. Governments have reached drug 
enforcement agreements, including the gradual elimination of 
surplus coca plantations, in which large sums of money have been 
earmarked for alternative development programs, interdiction 
actions against drug trafficking, and aid to help maintain 
Bolivia's balance of payments. 
  President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada recently voiced his 
concern over the presence of domestic disturbance factors in 
some regions of the country when he referred to the possibility 
of "narco-guerrilla" groups appearing in the country and warned 
of the need to look into this possibility more carefully. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said that there are signs of underlying 
violence in Chapare, and that if adequate and timely preventive 
measures are not taken the region could become a territory 
occupied by international drug cartels or even 
"narco-guerrillas." 
  The president's concern also reached Congress, where it was 
stated that the possibility of violent actions promoted by drug 
traffickers and terrorists in Chapare "is real," according to 
recent comments by Cochabamba Deputy Hector Cartagena, of the 
UCS [Solidarity Civic Union]. 
  Military sources consulted by LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz stated 
that the mentioned reports are being carefully assessed in order 
to reach a specific institutional evaluation, but that in any 
case it is up to President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, in his 
capacity as the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, to make 
the decision regarding the possibility of declaring Chapare, in 
Cochabamba, a "military zone."

  [Text] La Paz, 6 May (EFE) -- Members of a commission of 
government and opposition deputies created to investigate human 
right violations have received threats. Concern over the 
threats increased following the suspicion that a group of 
policemen and a prosecutor were responsible for torturing 
several individuals. 
  Ivan Miranda, Press Workers Federation secretary general, 
said today: "Government and other public office officials are 
creating a climate of terror among press workers." 
  The deputies denounced a police structure operating outside 
of the law. 
  Jorge Justiniano, legislator and leader of Democratic 
Socialism Alternative (ASD), has reported "a repressive police 
superstructure that puts everyone in a dangerous state of 
juridical insecurity." 
  Other members of the commission, including ruling party 
Deputy Luis Eduardo Siles and Ramiro Barrenechea of the 
indigenous movement Eje Pachacuti, said they have received phone 
threats. 
  Barrenechea went even further. He said one third of all 
legislators are being spied on and persecuted by members of 
state security organs. Interior Minister German Quiroga sharply 
rejected the accusation characterizing it as "irresponsible." 
  Commission members recently questioned more than a dozen 
people who had been arrested on charges of drug trafficking or 
terrorism. They all said they had been illegally arrested, 
interrogated, and tortured in alleged clandestine police centers. 
  They agreed that prosecutor Jose Nemtala was responsible for 
their alleged illegal arrests and torture. 
  Nemtala, a drug trafficking case prosecutor assigned to the 
Special Police Investigation Corp (CEIP), testified before the 
congressional commission on 5 May. He denied all charges 
against him by individuals indicted on charges of trafficking or 
terrorism. 
  Nemtala did recognize having acted illegally when he 
arrested 
journalist Judith Munoz a few days ago. Her release was ordered 
without charges several days after Nemtala ordered her arrest 
without court permission to interrogate her on her alleged links 
with terrorists and, specifically, on the murder of two U.S. 
members of the Mormon Church. 
  Nemtala said he ordered the arrest based on indications of 
her alleged responsibility mentioned in a report produced by the 
FBI.

  [Text] La Paz, 8 May (JATHA) -- Bolivian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar today stated that the signing of an extradition 
treaty with the United States is on the government's agenda. He 
noted that the government is determined to sign it if it would 
benefit the country. 
  Aranibar said that the government would, in any case, sign 
the treaty "safeguarding the principle of respect for national 
sovereignty." 
  The issue has resurfaced at a time when the Bolivian Supreme 
Court is studying a U.S. petition for the extradition of Colonel 
Faustino Rico Toro, a former drug enforcement official who is 
facing charges in a Florida state court. 
  Aranibar said: "An extradition treaty is on the agenda, and 
the Bolivian Government is now willing to discuss it, to 
negotiate it, and--if appropriate--to sign the respective 
treaty." 
  Aranibar added: "This is how things currently stand, and 
this is the approach with which the Bolivian Government is going 
to work. We are determined to look into the prospects for modern 
international legal cooperation, taking into account the 
country's interests and the principles of international law." 
  Since the extradition of Asunta "Chunty" Roca Surez in July 
1982, the Supreme Court has turned down similar U.S. extradition 
requests, arguing that there are contradictions between Bolivian 
laws and the Vienna convention on drug enforcement and 
extradition. 
  The Bolivian Government and the U.S. Embassy have time and 
again stated that the new extradition treaty--unlike the one 
currently in force, which dates back to 1900--will be 
specifically focused on the crime of drug trafficking.

  [Text] The Amazonas State Federal Police [PF] believe that 
the illegal trade in fish between Brazil and Colombia is 
concealing the international cocaine trafficking activities of 
the Leticia cartel. 
  According to Police Inspector Mauro Sposito, superintendent 
of the Amazonas State PF, the traffickers use fish to smuggle 
the drugs. 
  Sposito said that it has been learned that cocaine 
trafficking from Colombia to the United States is controlled by 
two Colombian brothers known as Evaristo and Henri. They own 
two fish packing plants that are used in the laundering of drug 
trafficking money. 
  A supervisor at the Brazilian Institute for the Environment 
and Renewable Natural Resources, who did not want to identify 
himself, suspects that the Colombian boats that come to Brazil 
to fetch fish are loaded with cocaine.

<F P=106> [Report by Sandra Vergara from the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] President Cesar Gaviria has not taken any steps 
backward regarding the elimination of sanctions for personal 
drug use. Today he warned the ruling of the Constitutional 
Court does not affect the struggle against drug trafficking. 
  Today, the president of the republic, speaking at the 
General 
Santander National Police Academy, made categorical remarks on 
the elimination of sanctions for personal drug use. He said he 
does not agree with this decision because several fundamental 
rights are at stake, including the right to security and 
tranquillity of Colombians. 
  [Begin Gaviria recording in progress] ...who believe that 
the 
interpretation of Article 16 of our constitution, which contains 
the right to personal independence, cannot be taken to extremes 
bringing us to an individualistic society. In this case, 
various rights come into conflict and the Court should have 
pondered the value of each right, should have tried to reconcile 
them, and should not have disregarded the rights to security, 
health, and tranquility of Colombians. 
  The government believes that carrying and consuming drugs 
for 
personal use should continue to be prohibited. [end recording] 
  The president of the republic concluded that severe 
restrictions will be adopted so that drug consumption will not 
take place in public places, schools, or universities, or so 
that drugs will not be consumed by minors, pregnant women, or by 
people doing jobs involving dangerous activities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Constitutional Court Justice </F>
Carlos Gaviria Diaz by program director Dario Arizmendi; place 
not given; from the "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Arizmendi] Dr. Carlos Gaviria Diaz is the 
judge who proposed the Constitutional Court's ruling lifting 
penalties on the consumption of personal doses of certain drugs. 
[passage omitted on biographical information] Good morning, Dr. 
Gaviria Diaz. 
  [Gaviria Diaz] Good morning, Dario. 
  [Arizmendi] What do you think of the controversy unleashed 
in the country and the witch hunt that has apparently begun 
against certain members of the Constitutional Court? This witch 
hunt is apparently against the judges who studied two articles 
of the law having to do with lifting penalties on the 
consumption of personal doses of certain types of drugs? 
  [Gaviria Diaz] Dario, you have clearly said that it is a 
true witch hunt. Actually, the most unfortunate thing about 
this is the fact that the mass of opinion is entirely emotional; 
that is, it does not really understand the scope of the ruling 
or is not even familiar with the ruling. Actually, this mass of 
opinion is jeopardizing the Constitutional Court, specifically 
the judges who approved lifting penalties. It makes us targets 
of very emotional reaction from the most fanatical groups. 
  It is surprising that this type of reaction was begun by the 
president of the republic and that the candidates--particularly 
those who have the best options for winning the Presidency of 
the Republic--are emulating this radical prohibition in order to 
curry public favor. Thus, I am very surprised about this 
reaction, but not because I did not think such an important 
ruling would entail challengers in the country. I am surprised 
about the sources of these challenges and what they are doing. 
They are encouraging the most destructive, emotional, 
fanatical, and dangerous reactions. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Gaviria Diaz, in addition to the issues 
broached by the president of the Republic and by some 
candidates, the most outstanding aspect just a few hours 
following the announcement of the Constitutional Court's ruling 
was the statements made by some judges who voted against the 
ruling. They openly criticized the ruling, and they even 
encouraged the public to do so. 
  [Gaviria Diaz] I do not want to adopt the same attitude they 
did. I deeply respect their points of view, which are different 
from ours, because everyone is entitled to his own opinion. 
However, I do regret they do not have that feeling of cohesion 
with the court. The rules of the game were observed, and once 
the ruling is approved the ruling belongs to the entire court 
and not just to some justices. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Gaviria Diaz, when will the entire ruling be 
announced? 
  [Gaviria Diaz] The entire ruling will be announced next 
week, when Court President Jorge Arango returns from President 
Mandela's inauguration. 
  [Arizmendi] As far as you know--because you are the author 
of the proposal--will this ruling take into consideration 
certain restrictions as the president of the Republic 
respectfully suggested when he delivered a radio message before 
knowing the full text of the ruling? 
  [Gaviria Diaz] There is a total lack of knowledge of what 
the mission of the court is, and I want to be very clear about 
this. People are acting as if the court had arbitrarily decided 
to lift penalties on drug consumption, as if we were acting as 
legislators, or deciding on something that simply pleased us. 
That is not the mission of the court. The mission of the court 
is to compare and decide if the contents of a law clash or not 
with the Constitution. In the event the court determines these 
contents clash with the Constitution, then the court is obliged 
to withdraw it, regardless of national or international reaction. 
  In the second place, it being said that now children and 
pregnant women are going to be using drugs, that drugs will be 
used in schools, and so forth. Dario, it is legal to drink 
liquor in Colombia, but I ask you: Is liquor being consumed in 
the schools? It is legal to smoke tobacco in Colombia, but are 
people smoking in church? With this, I am clearly saying that 
the court does not have to go into these details. The ruling 
simply makes general statements to this effect, but police 
regulations and other institutional regulations will restrict 
and control the consumption of drugs, just as is done with the 
consumption of alcohol and tobacco. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol 
Network in Spanish at 1230 GMT on 11 May, as part of its "0600 
to 0900 Newscast," broadcasts a live 60-minute interview with 
Colombian Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper 
Pizano by unidentified reporters at the Caracol studios in Santa 
Fe de Bogota. The interview is moderated by Caracol News 
Director Dario Arizmendi. 
  Before the interview gets under way, Arizmendi notes that 
the 
newscast was supposed to host a "debate" between Samper and 
Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana on the 
topics of "peace and drug trafficking," but he adds that 
Pastrana opted not to attend. Arizmendi does not give any 
reason for Pastrana's failure to attend, other than to say that 
after being invited to the debate, Pastrana sent a letter "to 
various media directors, proposing a list of topics, the radio 
and television newscasts to be visited, the duration of each 
debate, and so on." Arizmendi adds that the day before, 10 May, 
Pastrana's campaign manager "could not say whether Dr. Andres 
Pastrana could come to Caracol at this time in the morning." 
  The interview begins with Liberal Party Candidate Ernesto 
Samper Pizano replying to a question about the economic and 
political cost of peace with the guerrilla forces operating in 
Colombia: "The day we evaluate what violence costs the country, 
we will then realize that peace is very cheap." Samper agrees 
there is a "need for peace management," because a great many 
logistical issues are involved, such as where will the former 
guerrillas live, how will they earn a living, and what will be 
done with their property. Samper adds, "Already, many 
guerrillas are involved in organized crime." 
  Samper then stresses the need to "support peace through the 
business sector," noting that as development minister he 
arranged some very interesting meetings with businessmen with 
this goal in mind. 
  In replying to another question, Samper says guerrillas 
should be guaranteed minimum subsistence. He continues by 
saying "everything else" is negotiable, adding that the 
government is the one to set conditions and that the 
negotiations must be brief. He adds that it is necessary to 
draw out the bottom-line conditions required by both the 
government and the guerrillas before the two sides sit down to 
negotiate. 
  On the topic of when the peace process should begin, Samper 
says: "No deadline should be set, but the process should begin 
the day after the president is chosen--and I hope it is me--on 
30 May." 
  The topic then shifts to kidnapping, which one reporter 
describes "as intimately linked to subversion," and he asks 
Samper how his government intends to deal with this problem. 
Samper replies that he has supported the work of the Free 
Country Foundation (Fundacion Pais Libre), adding, "we need more 
legal regulatory guidelines." He continues: "We must have 
security organizations that must be committed to relatives of 
kidnapping victims in order to rescue the victims and return 
them to safety." 
  On the subject of the two basic guerrilla proposals--1) land 
reform and greater assistance for peasants, as demanded by the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia; and 2) a nationalistic 
oil policy, as demanded by the Army of National 
Liberation--Samper is asked: "To what degree would your 
government be willing to give in?" 
  Returning to the subject of dialogue with the guerrillas, 
Samper says he would entrust the work "to a high commissioner 
who would have the specific task of establishing all contacts, 
not only with the guerrillas, but also with civilian society, to 
create an atmosphere of peace." Asked whether peace is his top 
priority, Samper replies: "Peace must come hand in hand with 
security. For the common man on the street, aside from not 
being mugged, peace may very well mean also having job 
opportunities." He adds: "This peace must also be achieved 
within an overall security process, which means improving the 
security conditions under which many Colombians now live." 
  The subject then turns to the recent Constitutional Court 
decision to decriminalize the so-called "personal dose" of 
drugs, and Samper is asked whether he agrees with the 
government's position of waiting for the full text of the ruling 
to be published "next week" before announcing its final 
position. Samper says: "Yes, but we must also understand that 
the debate is not just a legal one, but also a political and 
social debate, because the simple decriminalization announcement 
for personal doses of drugs could begin turning countless 
sinister wheels in the drug underworld, which would encourage 
the selling of drugs for personal use to youths at rock-bottom 
prices." 
  Samper continues by saying he has changed his views on the 
legalization of drugs, because "when I proposed legalizing drugs 
15 years ago, the drug business only involved a few peasants who 
grew marijuana in Santa Marta's Sierra Neveda. At the time, I 
said: Let us buy out their drug production; let us give them the 
ability to change their crops, and this will allow us to get out 
from under the power of drugs. No one took any notice, and we 
then went from marijuana to coca, from coca to cocaine, and then 
came drug trafficking, and from drug trafficking we went to 
narcoterrorism. Obviously, conditions today make legalization 
totally unviable. It is not that I have changed my position. 
Instead, the circumstances have changed over the past 15 years, 
and this is why right now I have spoken out against 
decriminalization, because people might get the idea that this 
is some sort of pardon for everything that has taken place over 
the past 15 years. 
  "There are, however, very respectable people who continue to 
work on the legalization idea--for example, Dr. Alvaro Gomez 
Hurtado, who currently supports Dr. Andres Pastrana. Gomez has 
not been heard recently on any of these topics. It would be 
good to know whether he shares the opinions of Dr. Pastrana on 
this point, or whether he insists on his legalization idea." 
  Samper is asked whether the government should negotiate with 
the remaining drug cartels, as well as "how should these drug 
traffickers be confronted?" Samper says that he is "a fanatic 
believer that drug traffickers should be prosecuted under the 
law. If the prison terms have to be reviewed, fine. If 
term-reduction mechanisms need to be separated to prevent the 
two mechanisms from running in parallel, then this should be 
done. I fully agree that an immediate review should be 
instituted. We cannot deny Colombians the right that those who 
break the law receive a fair trial and a safe jail to serve 
their time. This is basically what the surrender policy is all 
about. I will therefore continue to support this policy, 
because I believe we cannot wait for the United States to reduce 
consumption or wait for Germany to halt the trafficking of 
chemical precursors to resolve the drug problem."

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez; place and </F>
date not given] 
  [Text] Minister of Justice Andres Gonzalez Diaz strongly 
and skillfully defended the new CPP [Criminal Procedures Code], 
which has been sharply criticized in the United States because 
it apparently deals very gently with drug traffickers. 
  Gonzalez said that in the three months it has been in 
effect, 
this Code has not yet had time to demonstrate all its benefits: 
"Among others, it has put an end to the automatic benefits 
criminals used to get." 
  In an interview with EL TIEMPO he also said that the 
excessive legal benefits drug traffickers receive come from old 
laws, most of which were abolished by the new Criminal 
Procedures Code. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Critics of the Criminal Procedures Code still 
say 
it is soft on crime and confused. 
  [Gonzalez] This Code has some fundamental features that 
nobody has emphasized. It has changed the system of benefits. In 
the old system there were automatic sentence reductions: 
Urdinola's attorney showed up and said here is his information, 
then the judge had to grant an automatic reduction without being 
able to evaluate the quality of that information. 
  Now, with the CPP reform, the effects of such information 
are 
not automatic. The Prosecutor General's Office can say: we are 
not interested in that information because it does nothing for 
us, so we are not going to give a significant sentence reduction. 
  The prosecutor can now adjust the reduction from one-sixth 
to 
two-thirds. 
  [EL TIEMPO] The maximum sentence for drug trafficking is 12 
years; then there are all sorts of reductions for good behavior, 
education, family visits, etc. This means that the sentences are 
almost ludicrous, but the Code retains that system. 
  [Gonzalez] The reduction for good behavior and education is 
part of the resocialization process for prisoners. That is a 
good part of the reason why our jails have not exploded like the 
ones in Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela. It is because people 
are studying or working; that is the only way to resocialize 
prisoners. 
  The problem is abuses in sentencing. For example, some 
criminals ask for a sentence reduction, claiming that they work 
24 hours a day plus Saturdays and Sundays; that is absurd. Mr. 
Mejia Sanin (the first drug trafficker to turn himself in), 
submitted a ridiculous list for work reduction. 
  We also have to realize that the majority of the sentences, 
like those for the Ochoas and Urdinola, for example, were not 
issued under the new Code. If Law 81 (the new CPP) had been in 
effect for Urdinola's case, he would not have gotten such a 
light sentence. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Why? 
  [Gonzalez] Mr. Urdinola is a person who, for all his crimes, 
was given 17.5 years in jail, and that was immediately and 
automatically reduced by 71 months for informing. Now 
prosecutors can graduate sentence reduction benefits. 
  We have to realize that a number of laws preceding the Code 
reform are still being applied; they need a more restrictive 
interpretation. 
  One problem is that Law 30 of 1986 establishes automatic 
sentence reduction benefits for informing. Most of the drug 
traffickers' attorneys have been using that law because it 
provides automatic benefits. The legislators must have realized 
this when it was passed, because of what was going on at that 
time. Still, there are other legal principles that can be 
applied to make it more rational, like the principle of 
proportionality. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What do you mean? 
  [Gonzalez] In each case the method used, the person's 
record, 
and the circumstances need to be considered. There cannot be a 
systematic mathematical interpretation. There must be a complete 
and objective interpretation of the laws. 
  The prosecutor and the judge must distinguish between 
different situations. If a person informs on the role played by 
an employee on his farm, a subordinate, or a minor in the 
commission of a crime, that cannot produce the same effects as 
if the farm worker gave information on a major criminal or the 
head of a criminal organization. 
  People need to realize that the CPP has totally changed the 
system of automatic reductions for a system of flexible and 
discretional reductions. 
  [EL TIEMPO] If the change was as positive as you say, then 
what are the problems with the CPP? 
  [Gonzalez] The problem is that many cases are still being 
tried with the old system. Law 30 of 1986 provides an automatic 
reduction which is certainly not appropriate, and that distorts 
the new Code. 
  [EL TIEMPO] That law is applied because it has not been 
repealed, and in Colombia the principle of "favorability" exists. 
  [Gonzalez] It has been tacitly repealed by Law 81, so it can 
not continue to be applied. If tomorrow Messrs. X, Y, or Z try 
to get Law 30 applied, we believe that can not be done. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Then the judge who applies it can be charged 
with 
professional misconduct? 
  [Gonzalez] We do not have to go that far. The most important 
thing is for us to say, and that is my goal as minister, that we 
have a number of old laws still being applied, and in our view 
this merits reflection on the part of us all--the entire legal 
community, all of the media--so they will not continue to be 
applied. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Why not repeal all that legislation that 
contradicts the new Code? 
  [Gonzalez] No, that would do nothing for us. A tacit and an 
explicit repeal have the same effects, meaning that the old laws 
can no longer be applied. It means that what must be applied is 
the new Code. 
  [EL TIEMPO] With these varied interpretations, what can be 
done to unify standards? 
  [Gonzalez] We have to work together with the Prosecutor 
General's Office, with the Attorney General's Office, to train 
judges and prosecutors and put a stop to this and say, wait a 
minute: legal interpretations granting all sorts of reductions 
with no basis in law cannot continue to be used. 
  I also believe we need to call upon all the judges to make a 
joint stand to fight a very serious problem. The greatest 
service we could do for criminals is to fight among ourselves; 
those people would be delighted. I want all of us to work 
together to support some restrictive interpretation criteria. 
The Supreme Court of Justice and the courts play a very 
important role. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Then Law 30 should not continue to be applied? 
  [Gonzalez] Law 30 is contrary to the new CPP and so it has 
[essentially] been repealed. That law provides automatic 
sentence reductions, and what the new Code contains is flexible 
and discretional, not automatic reductions. 
  There is also another law that should not be used as it 
contradicts the new Code: Law 48 of 1987, which provides a fixed 
reduction of one-sixth for persons who committed crimes before 1 
July 1986. 
  That law should apply only to crimes committed before July 
1986, but sometimes misinterpretations are made. How is it 
possible, I wonder, for a person who committed a crime covered 
by Law 48 of 1987, and who then continues committing crimes 
after that date, to get that benefit? How can a person invoke it 
by saying: "I committed part of the crime before 1986, and get 
benefits under that law? 
  We need a very strict interpretation to avoid applying these 
regulations indiscriminately. Drug traffickers turn themselves 
in and say: "I started to commit crimes when I was very young." 
That sounds like sincerity, but later we may find it was 
designed to get the sentence reduction benefits offered by that 
law. 
  Another factor is also being incorrectly used, and that is 
related to accumulations of automatic reductions. The former CPP 
allowed an automatic accumulation for confessions and for early 
sentencing. That was abolished in the new Code, as two 
reductions can not be given for the same reason. 
  All this explains why sentences are so short: the benefits 
of 
Law 30 of 1986 are applied, plus the accumulation of reductions 
for early sentencing and confession in 90 percent of the cases. 
  [EL TIEMPO] You have discussed the Code's benefits. What are 
its defects? 
  [Gonzalez] Obviously, one cannot deny that there is always 
room for improvement. Perhaps some very specific points should 
be reviewed, but I believe the fundamental reform the Criminal 
Code needs is for the maximum ceilings on penalties to be raised. 
  [EL TIEMPO] You sent a letter to the Prosecutor General 
listing the parameters the government wanted for the policy of 
criminals turning themselves in; you asked, for example, that in 
his confession and information, the person who turns himself in 
must inform on at least three members of his organization. Why 
is that not in the Code? 
  [Gonzalez] Many things are in codes, while others obviously 
depend on the application in each case. A law is by nature 
general, not personal. This Code does provide evaluation 
criteria for confessions. 
  [EL TIEMPO] People say that attorneys working for drug 
traffickers "advised" some members of Congress on the new CPP. 
  [Gonzalez] In each specific case the results of that contact 
and its possible effects need to be evaluated. In Congress there 
were some positions that could have supported such interests; 
most of them were defeated. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Like what positions? 
  [Gonzalez] For example, that prior collaboration might be a 
factor in providing reductions or benefits, in the case of some 
alleged collaboration by the criminals in prosecuting other 
cartels or other criminals. That was rejected both by the 
government and by the Prosecutor General's Office, and Congress 
helped us there. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What was the source of such proposals? 
  [Gonzalez] I could not say exactly the source of such 
proposals, but what I can tell you is that we could clearly 
discern proposals that might favor some special interests, and 
we worked against them. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Is a formal investigation being conducted? 
  [Gonzalez] There are groups both in Congress and in the 
judiciary with the authority to investigate that. 
  [EL TIEMPO] And are you, as minister, waiting to see what 
they will say? 
  [Gonzalez] As minister, I believe we need to do everything 
we 
can to clear up this matter. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Have you formally requested this? 
  [Gonzalez] I understand this information has started to come 
out, even at the initiative of some persons connected with those 
actions.

  [Text] President Cesar Gaviria yesterday gave a number of 
instructions to the country's mayors, governors, policemen, 
police detectives, and the administrative institutions that deal 
with public order. 
  In a directive defining the guidelines for national 
strategies against violence, the Security Advisory Board 
[Consejeria para la Seguridad] listed nine [as published] fronts 
of action to fight common delinquency and organized crime. 
<H5>  Anti-Violence </H5>
  The National Police, the Defense Ministry, and security 
organizations, under the coordination of the Prosecutor 
General's Office, must create and support the Specialized 
Homicide Brigades [Brigadas Especializadas en Homicidios] to be 
deployed in the most critical regions to promote gun control. 
  The Armed Forces will toughen their fight against subversion 
by training their staff and broadening their operational 
capacity by means of carrying out other actions to attack the 
financial sources of the subversion and the groups that embrace 
private justice and common delinquency. 
  In short, according to the directive, the DAS 
[Administrative 
Department of Security] will coordinate with the Prosecutor 
General's Office, the Finance Ministry, the Bank of the 
Republic, and the National Superintendency of Banks the 
development of specific plans to curtail money laundering, 
irregular money inflows, and illegal enrichment. 
  The government in due time will promote campaigns asking 
citizens to help eradicate kidnappings. Meanwhile, the Defense 
Ministry will adjust budget guidelines to improve the 
performance of the Unase [Antiextortion and Kidnapping Unit]. 
<H5>  Justice </H5>
  The directive goes on. Mayors and governors must give 
priority to developing local security plans, which must be 
submitted to the National Security Council before 30 June. 
These officials must also prepare the Justice Development Plan 
[Plan de Desarrollo de la Justicia], update the infringement 
system [regimen de contravenciones], promote the mechanisms for 
out-of-court conflict settlements, and cooperate in the 
consolidation of the Prosecutor General's Office and the legal 
[acusatorio] system. 
  Meanwhile, the National Penitentiary and Prison Institute 
must expedite the construction of six new prison centers and 
bolster the maximum security wings. 
<H5>  Police Force </H5>
  The Defense Ministry must increase the presence of policemen 
nationwide. The goal is to increase the number of professional 
soldiers by 10,000 in two years and to create two new mobile 
brigades. 
  Likewise, within a month, the National Police must champion 
the Career Statutes [Estatutos de Carrera] and conduct 
evaluations of the agenda of the Immediate Attention Centers 
(CAI) to improve their performance. The National Police 
commissioner, meanwhile, must restructure within two months the 
procedures to respond to the complaints of citizens. 
<H5>  Intelligence </H5>
  According to the new presidential directive, the Defense 
Ministry must strengthen the channels of coordination among 
security agencies and upgrade communications systems to ensure 
that all intelligence organizations are linked within three 
years. 
  Policemen, the DAS, and the Prosecutor General's Office must 
prepare a counterintelligence program to avert subversion and 
drug trafficking infiltrations and to prevent internal 
corruption within the State's security corps. 
<H5>  Peace and Reintegration </H5>
  Those guerrilla groups that show a resolute willingness to 
rejoin civilian life will benefit from reintegration plans that 
include judicial and sociopolitical guarantees, as well as 
security guarantees. 
  Only the president, through the Peace Counseling Board 
[Consejeria para la Paz] and the PNR [National Rehabilitarion 
Plan], will hold talks and negotiations with those groups who 
accept preestablished conditions. 
  President Gaviria reaffirmed the validity of the 
reintegration plans for guerrillas to rejoin civilian life and 
said that mayors and governors will actively participate in the 
implementation of these plans to guarantee that the commitments 
included in the political agreements of each department will be 
honored. 
<H5>  Options for Youths </H5>
  The Education Ministry, with the help of the private sector, 
will persist in promoting efforts to achieve the expansion of 
high school education through the creation of 600,000 new high 
school openings by 1995. 
  The Labor Ministry, with the help of governors, mayors, and 
the Presidency, will promote the development of local, national, 
and regional programs to offer counseling, orientation, and 
training to potential entrepreneurs and job-seeking youths. 
<H5>  Human Rights </H5>
  The presidency will continue to promote programs to defend 
human rights and democracy by conducting civic education 
campaigns to respect rights and their mechanisms of protection.

<F P=106> [Report by Raul Gutierrez; from the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The Colombian Government decided to lift the state 
of internal disturbance decreed on 1 May. However, in order to 
prevent the release of an overwhelming number of inmates, the 
government also decided to extend the judicial emergency decree. 
The decree which was signed by the president and all his 
cabinet ministers stipulates that the emergency will be extended 
for an additional 90 days. 
  The government justifies the measure by indicating that the 
Prosecutor General's Office and the courts will now have 
sufficient time and resources to complete investigations still 
under way as well as to render a decision. 
  As of today, all circuit judges will be allowed to become 
involved in cases which up until now were restricted only to 
special judges. Ten days ago, 42 regional judges were 
responsible for handling 4,500 cases dealing with drug 
trafficking, terrorism, and kidnapping. This backlog prevented 
them from completing the cases within the period stipulated by 
law, the reason for which the judicial emergency was declared.

  [Text] Eighty-five percent of 1,278 people polled by 
Caracol Network over the weekend said they reject a 
decriminalization of personal doses of drugs. Barely 15 percent 
agreed with Thursday's ruling by the Constitutional Court. Some 
50 percent of the 15 percent who agreed with the ruling added 
that, although they support the decision, personal drug doses 
should be properly regulated; 25 percent said it was good to 
publicly approve drug use; 16.7 percent said it was a vote of 
confidence in young people; and 8.3 percent said they agreed 
with the decision because it would reduce the price of drugs. 
  We repeat that 85 percent voiced opposition to the 
decriminalization. Why did they oppose it? Some 31.3 percent 
said they opposed the ruling because it represented a health 
threat; 15 percent said it would put more criminals and drug 
addicts on the streets; 14.3 percent said they agreed with the 
call for a referendum on the issue; 7.5 percent said they were 
against decriminalization because it would lead to state 
corruption; 7.5 percent opposed it because it would create 
double standards within the Colombian judicial system; 7.5 
percent said young people must first be educated, adding that 
this task has yet to be carried out; 6.1 percent did not agree 
because they felt the decision was based on U.S. interference; 
5.4 percent did not agree because drug consumption is senseless; 
and 5.4 percent said they rejected the ruling because the 
current Constitution is inadequate and incongruous.

<F P=106> [Responses to an EL TIEMPO questionnaire on campaign issues </F>
by Colombian presidential candidates Ernesto Samper Pizano of 
the Liberal Party, Andres Pastrana of the Conservative Party, 
and Antonio Navarro Wolff of the 19 April Movement-Democratic 
Alliance] 
  [Text] [EL TIEMPO] 1. When and how does corruption occur? 
In your opinion, where are the highest levels of corruption in 
Colombia? 
  [Samper] The country's highest corruption rates are found 
within the public administration because of influence peddling, 
irregularities in the handling of contracts and procedures, and 
illegal actions by government officials. Certain positions 
within the government are more vulnerable to corruption and the 
abuse of power because of the nature of their functions. 
Therefore, the plan against corruption I have proposed includes 
special mechanisms to identify and control those positions and 
create "transparency zones" [zonas de transparencia] in the 
administration. 
  [Pastrana] The highest levels of corruption in Colombia are 
linked to the large mafias, particularly the mafias involved in 
drug trafficking and contraband. These mafias have managed to 
infiltrate institutions such as civil aeronautics, customs, 
justice, and the political system. Administrative corruption 
has also grown because the state continues to be viewed as 
political booty. The result is a distorted administrative 
structure--one without goals, dominated by power brokers, 
characterized by permanent changes in leadership, and which 
lacks incentives for honest officials; one in which 
disorganization fosters corruption. Taking into consideration 
that this same "politization" dominates our control mechanisms 
and that our justice system has shown little efficiency, is not 
hard to understand that why a climate that favors the use of 
public posts for personal gain has spread. 
  [Navarro] THE ECONOMIST has described Colombia as one of the 
most corrupt countries in the world. We believe it is one of 
the most corrupt countries in Latin America. The roots of 
corruption are embedded in the breakdown of our social values, 
where religious ethics have not been maintained or have been 
replaced by secular ethics. Corruption is eroding relations 
between the public and private sectors in two main areas: 
decisionmaking and compliance with the law. In order for 
corruption to exist, someone must be willing to take money and 
someone must be willing to pay it. In the state, corruption is 
basically concentrated in the Executive Branch, because this is 
where most decisions are made and most funds are handled. 
Taking into account there are some exceptions, corruption 
occurs from the highest national levels to the lowest municipal 
levels. This is clearly associated with public activities, 
particularly with politics. 
  [EL TIEMPO] 2. Will you "negotiate" with Congress? Congress 
and the government have been criticized for negotiating bills in 
exchange for sinecures (appropriations, positions, etc.). Do 
you believe this mechanism contributes to corruption? Would you 
employ it during your tenure? 
  [Samper] Of course this mechanism contributes to corruption, 
and therefore, I will not use it. That was why the Ethics Code 
of last year's campaign clearly stipulated the responsibility of 
congressmen supporting my candidacy. Those congressmen are 
committed to back and promote from Congress the approval of 
measures aimed at facilitating the government plan I have been 
presenting to Colombians. In a way, it is a programmatic vote 
at a national level. 
  [Navarro] Independent government branches are essential in a 
mature democracy. Therefore, not only will I not employ this 
mechanism, but I propose that as of today, it be considered a 
crime to do so. 
  [Pastrana] The country strongly opposed the appropriations. 
Therefore, we should not yield to any pressure to reinstate 
them. The problem of positions is linked to a concept of 
bureaucratic rewards that causes great harm to the country. The 
weak partisan structures make relations between the president 
and Congress difficult. We must establish rules to ensure 
governability. I believe it would be a good idea to explore the 
mechanism of a pact similar to the one signed by the New 
Democratic Force with President Gaviria. That pact should seek 
a commitment with the government plans, and, at the same time, 
it should publicly assume responsibility in policies. In 
addition, we should create a political consensus around a 
development plan that would alleviate pressure on annual budgets. 
<H5>  3. Other Measures </H5>
  [EL TIEMPO] What other measures, in addition to draft bills 
or statutes, will you implement to fight corruption? 
  [Samper] Our task is to once again make ethics a form of 
social behavior. To my way of thinking, it is fundamental that 
the laws generate credibility and thus encourage citizen 
participation, which I consider the only way to win the struggle 
against corruption. If we do not get the people to join the 
struggle by reporting and cooperating, the task of moralization 
will be very difficult. I intend for my government to once 
again have grade school classes in constitutional ethics and 
civics instituted, so that new citizens being formed in school 
classes may once again take up the lost concept of good 
citizenship. 
  [Pastrana] I have already begun. The Congress Ethics 
Commission was created at my request and has started combating 
corruption in the Legislative Branch. The statute against 
corruption that I submitted will allow the state the legal basis 
to investigate and prevent corrupt behavior. It is important to 
break up that "marriage" between the corruptor and a corrupt 
person. An organization with power and citizen support is 
required to carry out intelligence operations as specified in 
the statute. 
  Special treatment and a commitment by society and by the 
state is required in order to cope with the Mafia. The status 
of the war against narcotics trafficking is a result of the 
permissiveness of government and society. Contraband has always 
been allowed by the passive and permissive attitude of society. 
First, there were the sanandresitos [area where smuggled goods 
are sold openly], and today there are strong ties between 
contraband and money laundering. The presence of these monies in 
political parties and in Congress is an insult to the country. 
Society must wage a considerable battle against contraband if 
we want to defend our industries and our jobs. 
  The issue of the Cusiana [oil fields] is something else. The 
country is worried about the macroeconomic effects, but it has 
not devoted much attention to how to prevent corrupt practices 
associated with financial boons. Many countries have squandered 
opportunities that have arisen from such a boon. 
  [Navarro] Laws and statutes are necessary. They must 
include appointing civic supervisors, punishing more severely 
front men in money laundering operations and those who pay 
bribes, lifting bank secrecy laws, requiring public officials to 
provide statements of income, strengthening control mechanisms, 
and rewarding informants, among other things. In addition, two 
essential things are needed: 
  A) To practice new ethics and preach by good example, 
starting with the president of the Republic. 
  B) To organize an Operation Clean Hands as of 1500 on 7 
August 1994 led by the Search Bloc against corruption, with the 
participation of the Presidency of the Republic, the Prosecutor 
General's Office, the Attorney General's Office, the Treasury 
Overseer's Office, and the technical and support teams that are 
necessary. 
<H5>  4. Strategies </H5>
  [EL TIEMPO] How will you cope with corruption at the 
national, departmental, and local levels? 
  [Samper] This will be done by strictly applying the 
anticorruption statute which I presented and which I hope will 
become a law as soon as possible. In addition, it is necessary 
to promote citizen participation in this struggle against 
corruption, through public trials, citizens supervisors, and 
privileged access to information. 
  Colombian democracy cannot succumb to the cancer of 
corruption, which is as dangerous as violence itself. It must 
strengthen and expedite the work of the control mechanisms. The 
Attorney General's Office, the Comptroller General's Office, and 
the Treasury Overseer's Office exist for these basic purposes. 
As for the issue of regional officials, that worries me, 
because we cannot allow this great democratic achievement of 
political decentralization to be foiled by the actions of 
corrupt and immoral regional officials. The people in the 
regions must choose their representatives well, since this is 
the only manner of ensuring that decentralization successfully 
stays on course. 
  [Pastrana] It is essential to strengthen and make 
independent 
all control structures. This must be done not only among those 
in charge of disciplinary and penal control, but also among 
those responsible for the control of efforts and results. In 
the first case, it is important that the country have a visible 
leader from whom the people can demand results. The Attorney 
General's Office must take over this role in cases of 
administrative corruption, just as the Prosecutor General's 
Office has been doing for other crimes. 
  In the second case, deficiencies at the comptrollerships are 
considerable and more attention should be paid to them. It is 
also necessary to strengthen the superintendencies to prevent 
aberrant situations such as those observed in the public 
services, or financial crises such as we had in 1982 or the one 
that Venezuela is currently experiencing. To conclude, a pledge 
must be made to modernize the administration, increase the 
continuity of the managerial structure, and actively involve 
various civic organization in the administration and 
surveillance of public services. 
  [Navarro] The points outlined above are the main strategies 
we will use. In addition, we will adopt the following specific 
measures: 
  A. We will give the post of Overseer of the Treasury 
permanent status, maintain Dr. Jorge Garcia Hurtado as its 
director, give that office more punitive duties and its own 
agents in the departments and in the 50 most highly populated 
municipalities of the country. We will also establish alternate 
overseers in the municipalities that receive seizable bonuses. 
  B. As of 7 August 1994 all employees, beginning with the 
president and vice president of the Republic, must declare their 
properties and incomes at the Office of the Overseer of the 
Treasury. The GAZETTE will publish the declarations of 
officials who have jurisdiction and control on the day they are 
sworn in and on the day they retire. 
  [EL TIEMPO] 5. What is the connection between the 
centralization of power and corruption? What will you do about 
this situation? 
  [Samper] Someone once said: "Absolute power corrupts 
absolutely." Therefore, the best way to avoid this corrupting 
power is to open democracy, decentralize power, and implement 
efficient and effective mechanisms like the ones foreseen in the 
new Constitution. This connection exists throughout the world, 
and therefore it is essential to continue to achieve progress in 
the regional and local autonomy processes--so that power is 
distributed among more people and so the citizenry has more 
access to it. Fortunately, in Colombia we have a presidential 
regime; with the 1991 Constitution, we continue to strengthen 
the other two state branches--the legislative branch and the 
judicial branch. Nevertheless, we can and must do much more for 
the balance and independence of these branches, and to give more 
power to the regions. 
  [Pastrana] I have no doubts about the connection between the 
concentration of power and corruption--both political power and 
economic power--and even worse is the possibility of either of 
them ending up controlling the media. The Television 
Broadcasting Law should ensure that this cannot happen and that 
the executive branch should be ready to fight the figureheads 
with all means at its disposal. 
  We must also strengthen the overseeing authorities and 
establish political campaign financing limits. 
  [Navarro] Of course there is a connection. The 
centralization of power implies a weakening of checks and 
balances. This is why we will move toward a balance of power, 
as outlined by the spirit of the Constitution. We will also use 
the Search Block we mentioned before to combat our current 
problems. 
  [EL TIEMPO] 6. Campaign financing could generate corruption. 
What changes will you make in this area? 
  [Samper] I believe significant steps have already been taken 
to control the entry of funds whose origin is unknown. There 
are two basic measures that should be highlighted: government 
financing and the work of the Overseer of the National Treasury. 
It is urgently necessary for these measures to go even further, 
and it is up to us candidates to show transparency and honesty 
in financing our campaigns. This is why I appointed a director 
of ethics to control our income. 
  [Pastrana] Illegal money and contributions by economic 
groups 
should be handled differently. Regarding the former, 
eradication is part of the comprehensive strategy I proposed 
against drug trafficking and contraband. We must also fight the 
negative influence of economic groups and their control over 
politics. The 1991 Constitution took one step forward by 
obliging the state to finance political campaigns and by 
controlling the contributions made by private individuals. To 
do this, we need to tighten the measures regarding auditing, 
accountability, and public reporting of campaign resources. 
  [Navarro] It is absolutely essential to establish spending 
limits for political campaigns. The ceilings do exist today, 
but there is no control over penalties for those who violate 
them. I propose that the Overseer of the National Treasury 
serve as the authority to enforce these controls and that any 
violation of them be reason for disqualification. 
  In addition, it is essential that information regarding 
campaign finances be verifiable and that any related violation 
also be reason for harsh penalties. 
  [EL TIEMPO] 7. The Inspector General's Office, the Attorney 
General's Office, and the Comptroller General's Office require 
changes to become more effective. What are these changes, and 
when should such changes be implemented? 
  [Samper] It is necessary to make investigation procedures 
more efficient and to conduct them expeditiously to convince the 
people, who often do not believe these institutions are 
reliable. It is necessary to eliminate obstacles and simplify 
procedures. Investigations of public officials should not go on 
for four or five years, and sentences should not be announced 
when the officials are no longer in office. Greater efforts 
must be made to update and improve these institutions. Also, it 
is necessary to standardize penalties and procedures for all 
public officials. It might even be advisable to consider the 
possibility of officials waiving statute of limitations benefits 
in disciplinary investigations in corruption cases. 
  [Pastrana] All of these institutions require urgent changes. 
Nevertheless, I do not think there are any clear-cut means to 
enable the people to assess the results of such changes. The 
Attorney General's Office should become the great visible leader 
in the fight against corruption--the great ally of the people. 
This office should be invested with broad powers to conduct 
investigations and show results to society. The Comptroller 
General's Office should be made to fit the new concept of 
stringent procedures and results. It is incredible that, while 
our public institutions are inefficient, the citizens do not 
have information enabling them to pressure for the necessary 
changes. 
  [Navarro] Several changes have already been mentioned, in 
particular those within the Inspector's Office, which seek to 
strengthen the office and keep the current inspector. This is 
very important because he has exceeded the expectations placed 
on his position. An Inspector's Office without bite is of no 
use. 
  The Comptroller General's Office requires in-depth reforms, 
because it is one of the state's most influence-peddling 
institutions. This is why we did not include it in the Counter- 
Corruption Search Block that we propose. 
  It is necessary to start by changing the procedure to 
appoint 
the comptroller general, for which the Congress is currently 
responsible. The comptroller general should be appointed by the 
attorney general, the Inspector General's Office, and the 
Legislative Assembly's judicial commission. In addition, the 
comtroller general's control functions should be strengthened 
urgently as ordered by the Constitution. 
  [EL TIEMPO] 8. During your government, what specific 
mechanisms will the citizens have to actively participate in the 
struggle against corruption? 
  [Pastrana] There are several mechanisms that should be 
implemented. First, public hearings would allow public 
officials and the community's representatives to meet to discuss 
and resolve matters related to efficiency and morality in 
carrying out the tasks in the relevant institutions. Meanwhile, 
civilian overseers should be organized with the power to request 
from state officials information on contracts and agreements 
signed by various administrations. This will allow the citizens 
to know what these contracts are all about. Last, the promotion 
of active participation is necessary by the various media in 
this struggle in order to facilitate this task. 
  [Samper] The people and the press should play an active role 
in the struggle against corruption. It is important to instill 
in the citizens high moral values and to organize a broad 
council whose main goal will be to outline goals and assess 
results. Moreover, the common, everyday citizen should be 
constantly informed on the quality of services he receives and 
on the costs of negligence and corruption he is forced to pay. 
To reach this goal, it is necessary to have more dynamic media 
and to establish an information system of an obligatory nature 
that is easily understood by all Colombians. 
  [Navarro] The citizens will have two specific types of 
anticorruption duties: 
  A. The accusation, with mechanisms as those previously 
mentioned, such as protection of witnesses and rewards for 
information, which would go to individuals or to organized 
communities. 
  B. Control of the process of public contracts and their 
execution, as well as in the decisionmaking process in matters 
of public interests We will also establish the community tax 
clearance certificate. 
  A great deal of encouragement will be given to all of those 
municipal administrations that, in keeping with current laws, 
offer active participation to citizens when awarding contracts 
for public works projects in the community. 
  [EL TIEMPO] 9. And what about the police? Are the changes 
implemented in the police effective enough to control corruption 
within this institution? Why? 
  [Samper] We cannot deny that progress has been made in 
cleansing the police. Nevertheless, the population still 
considers corruption to be the main problem within this 
institution, which obviously encourages growing distrust. The 
recent creation of the post of national high commissioner and 
the excellent performance by the former directors have 
contributed to the institution's efficiency. Likewise, it has 
contributed to improving the institution's public image. 
However, there is still much to be done such as training, 
increasing the number of units, especially in the large cities, 
and establishing efficient and acceptable mechanisms that will 
prevent excesses by some institution members. 
  [Pastrana] For many years we have neglected our police. 
Restoring citizen safety depends in great measure on our ability 
to rescue this institution. Changes are important, but we must 
be cautious in order to be able to adapt to an ever-changing 
situation. I would welcome a more concrete commitment by the 
Executive Branch, because the reforms, including the 
institution's control and cleansing guidelines require 
significant investment. 
  [Navarro] Apparently, not. It is necessary to wait for the 
results of the preliminary report prepared by the National 
Commission, a body created within the police as a result of the 
recent restructuring. If it is demonstrated that it is 
insufficient, new changes will need to be implemented to grant 
more control to the population. 
  [EL TIEMPO] 10. Performance Indicators. If you were 
president, which indicators could the Colombian people resort to 
in order to evaluate your performance in the struggle against 
corruption? 
  [Samper] They could rely on the most important indicator for 
a public official: the ability to honor promises made--my word. 
  [Pastrana] During my government, I will be committed to 
eradicating contraband from Colombia. We are talking about a 
frontal and permanent struggle for the survival of our entire 
industry and honest work in general. Another of my objectives 
is to continue the battle the country has been waging against 
the influence of drug trafficking. All the officials in my 
administration will be honest and divorced from petty political 
party interests. We cannot continue attacking influence 
peddling during campaigns and at the same time exercise it in 
the government. 
  [Navarro] The indicators will be as follows: 
  A. The number of inmates and persons tried for crimes 
carried out against the public. 
  B. The public resources recovered during Operation Clean 
Hands which I propose be carried out by the Search Bloc against 
corruption. 
  C. The number of citizens overseeing operations throughout 
the country at the end of my term. 
  D. The number of public officials who demonstrate 
transparency in carrying out their duties, which will be 
measured through their disclosing their income and property. 
  E. The results of the reforms implemented to the 
institutions which I referred to previously.

  [Text] Mexico is living a narcodemocracy and 
narcotraffickers have achieved socioeconomic influence, Eduardo 
Valle Espinoza, former adviser to the Attorney General's office 
[PGR] of Diego Valades and Jorge Carpizo, has stated. Valle, 
who resigned on 1 May, stated the foregoing in his resignation 
letter. 
  "After learning of the above, I ask: When will we have the 
courage and political maturity to tell the Mexican people we are 
living in a narcodemocracy? Will we have the intellectual 
capability and ethical strength to say that Amado Carrillo, 
Arellano Felix, and Juan Garcia Abrego are, inconceivably and 
degradingly, the promoters and even pillars of our socioeconomic 
growth and development? 
  In his resignation letter, the official briefly explained 
the 
narcotrafficking problem in Mexico and he recognized his failure 
to dismantle the Matamoros Cartel led by Juan Garcia Abrego. 
This was a task which had been assigned to him by Valades. 
  "I recognize that I did not have the capability to apprehend 
the public leader of the Gulf of Mexico Cartel. I truthfully 
did all that I could within my means. I failed and regrettably 
admit it," the former PGR adviser stated. 
  His resignation had been kept silent for unexplained 
reasons. 
  "I am leaving as I entered. I have no money, but I have 
gained knowledge and experience. Nobody can say I harmed anyone 
without a true juridical basis. I can look anyone in the face 
and feel no shame," he stated in his letter. 
  Valle Espinoza also questioned the programs and plans to 
fight narcotrafficking and raised the possibility that the 
assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio may have been drug-related. 
  "Nobody can conceive of a political project in which the 
narcotrafficking lords and financiers are not included, because 
if he does so he is dead." Perhaps evidence of that will be 
found in relation to the 23 March incident in Tijuana. 
Although, I warn, I don't have any more information about that 
infamous act than that which is publicly known. 
  In the last part of his letter, Valle Espinoza thanked 
Carpizo and the president for their trust, which he claims he 
never failed. Valle Espinoza was appointed to his post in early 
1993. 
  Valle Espinoza began to hunt down Garcia Abrego with the 
support of 30 agents, all heavily armed and recruited by 
himself. He was also provided with communications equipment, 
vehicles, two helicopters, an aircraft, and a big budget. 
  According to official investigations, the Gulf Cartel, known 
previously as the Matamoros Cartel, has $10 billion in 
resources, heavy political and police influence, and an "Army" 
of over 500 men. The PGR is investigating since last week the 
transfer of Garcia Abrego and his principal deputies. 
  Valle's actions resulted in the arrests of 10 drug 
traffickers and the confiscation of at least 50 properties in 
various states of the republic.

  [Excerpts] Chilpancingo, Guerrero, 20 April--"Luis Donaldo 
Colosio Murrieta's assassination did not originate in any 
national conspiracy involving very powerful groups or 
politicians." This assertion was made here today by Rafael 
Aguilar Talamantes, candidate for the presidency of the republic 
from the Party of the Cardenist Front for National 
Reconstruction (PFCRN). 
  He added: "Colosio's sacrifice was due to regional interests 
of drug trafficking Mafias which, finding their financial income 
impaired, took revenge on President Carlos Salinas de Gortari by 
killing his favorite political son. They realized that they 
would be striking him where it hurt most." [passage omitted] 
  Rafael Aguilar Talamantes remarked that, during the Salinas 
de Gortari regime, a strenuous battle was waged (and is still 
being waged) throughout the national territory to take 
prosecutory action against the interests of the Mafias engaged 
in drug growing and trafficking. No such battle ever occurred 
during any other six-year term, he noted, adding that this meant 
that "those hurt would take revenge on someone whose death would 
grieve the president, and that person was, indisputably, Colosio 
Murrieta." 
  He commented: "By killing Colosio, they knew that they would 
deal a severe moral and political blow to his benefactor, his 
political father." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tijuana, Baja California [BC], 18 April--The PAN's 
[National Action Party] local congressional faction submitted a 
report to the state's governor, Ernesto Ruffo Appel, regarding 
the shooting that occurred in this town on 3 March. It declares 
that the State Judicial Police (PJE) have been implicated in the 
drug traffic "ever since Francisco Franco Rios was named head of 
the State Attorney General's Office." This claim was made today 
by Congressman Armando Ayon, a member of the legislative body's 
Justice Commission. 
  Armando Ayon added that the document confirms certain 
statements made by Mexico's ambassador in France and by the 
ex-attorney general of the republic, Ignacio Morales Lechuga, to 
the effect that "Baja California judicial agents are giving 
protection to the drug traffic." 
  The document sent to Ruffo Appel was ratified by the eight 
PAN congressmen in the present legislature, who explain: "Not 
all the Judicial Branch officials and agents are in collusion 
with the drug traffic." 
  The investigation was conducted after the shooting that 
occurred on 3 March at the La Mesa local branch office, where 
five persons were killed: an incident that has not yet been 
totally explained. According to the aforementioned report, PJE 
agents gave protection to at least one of the drug traffickers 
involved in the shooting on this town's Diaz Ordaz Boulevard. 
  For this reason, the congressmen requested that Ruffo Appel 
call for the resignation of Francisco Franco Rios, since the 
police collusion with the drug traffic has been proven. 
  The PJE commander detailed here, Jorge Alvarez Barriere, for 
his part, announced that 13 agents from the force had been 
dismissed within the past two weeks: five for showing positive 
results in the drug testing, and the other eight for "loss of 
confidence" in them.

  [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 8 May -- Given its 
geographic location, its almost 40 km of common border with the 
richest state in the United States, and its economic potential, 
this city has been one of the areas most contested by drug gangs 
and cartels that operate in Mexico. This is particularly true 
of the those led by the Arellano Felix brothers and by Hector 
Palma Salazar, alias El Guero Palma. 
  The war among drug trafficking mafias has left behind a wake 
of death and violence. In the past two years more than 50 
"executions" have taken place involving the death of people 
linked to these two gangs that are vying for control of this 
area, which is strategic for drug trafficking. 
  Tijuana, which is a natural stepping stone en route to the 
world's largest drug consuming market, has been known for its 
large numbers of drug seizures. In the past 16 months in this 
area approximately 65,500 kg of marijuana and 16,316 kg of 
cocaine, as well as 10 kg of heroin, have been seized, 
demonstrating that this is a place favored by drug traffickers, 
according to the Attorney General's Office. 
  The streets in this city have been the scene of drug 
trafficking gang rivalries and of police complicity with these 
gangs, as well as an increase in drug abuse among the community, 
particularly among youths. 
  So far this year, five deaths have been attributed to the 
drug trafficking groups. Of these deaths, the murder of 
Alejandro Castaneda Andre, commander of the special group of the 
Judicial Federal Police [PFJ], and the 28 April murder of 
Federico Benitez Lopez, director of Municipal Public Security 
and of his driver Ramon Alerid Cardenas, stand out. In this 
last case, no one has been arrested, and there are no leads. In 
the Castaneda Andrade case, however, a state judicial police 
officer, who was in the company of a group of drug traffickers, 
and a "godmother" were arrested. Nevertheless, what is most 
remarkable is that legal action was taken against Sergio Ortiz 
Lara, the state's deputy prosecutor, for helping in the escape 
of members of the Arellano Felix gangs. 
  According to an investigation conducted by the National Poll 
on drug use in Baja California and Tijuana, in particular, the 
community is becoming a large consumer market, particularly for 
drugs such as cocaine and crack. In the study, it is pointed out 
that the results indicate that the majority of the youths polled 
in junior high and high schools started abusing drugs before 
they were 15. 
  The struggle by drug cartels to impose their control on this 
area has given way to the so-called "executions" that in the 
last 24 months have taken as victims a state judicial police 
agent; Wenceslao Berinstain Avila, a former Attorney General's 
Office agent; Pedro Rodriguez Moreno, a customs agent; Israel 
Alvarado Acosta and an associate; and Jose Luis Stavinsky, son 
of a well-know Tijuana businessman, in addition to many other 
victims. The majority of these cases remain unpunished. 
  The drug cartels' struggle for this city and other important 
sites for drug trafficking activities came out in the open a 
year ago in Guadalajara, Jalisco, when Cardinal Juan Jesus 
Posada Ocampo and six other individuals were murdered. The 
incident took place during a confrontation at the Guadalajara 
airport among groups led by the Arellano Felix brothers; Joaquin 
Guzman Loera, alias El Chapo Guzman; and El Guero Palma. 
Previously a confrontation had taken place among them at the 
disco Christine de Puerto Vallarta. 
  The Arellano Felix brothers--Ramon, Benjamin, and 
Javier--are 
the ones who have controlled this activity in Tijuana in the 
past few years, after they inherited control from their uncle 
Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo. Felix Gallardo during his time and 
up until his incarceration at the high security penitentiary in 
Almoloya, Juarez, was considered the capo of Mexico's largest 
drug trafficking ring. 
  Arellano Felix's power and influence became obvious when 35 
safe houses, a farm, and an industrial factory were seized. In 
the factory an unfinished tunnel was uncovered. This tunnel was 
to connect this city with San Diego to smuggle drugs into the 
United States. 
  Recently the PGR sold off properties belonging to this gang 
consisting of 12 furniture lots, stuffed animals, vintage wines, 
paintings and sculptures of well-known artists, and other 
ostentatious articles, the starting bidding price of which was 
134,642 pesos. Two days before, 11 homes that had been seized 
were put on public auction; however, only one was sold, the 
price of which is unknown. The company in charge of carrying out 
this operation was Avaluos Integrales S.A. de CV, contracted by 
the PGR itself. 
  Up until now, the Arrellano Felix brothers remain at large, 
with the exception of Francisco Javier Arellano Felix who in 
December was arrested by the PJF in this city. He was 
transferred to the Almoloya high security jail in Juarez where 
his staunch rival, Joaquin Guzman, alias El Chapo Guzman, has 
been since June. El Chapo Guzman was arrested in Guatemala and 
turned over to the Mexican authorities. 
  The last time any news was heard about the Arellano Felix 
gang was on 3 March during the shoot out in which Alexandro 
Castaneda Andrade, commander of the special group of the PFJ in 
that city, was killed. Andrade had located the site where 
Javier Arellano Felix, alias El Tigrillo, and his lieutenant 
Ismael Higuera Guerrero, alias El Mayel, were hiding. However, 
he was killed during the confrontation when he attempted to 
arrest them. The case still has not been totally cleared up, 
but, according to versions of the PRG itself, El Tigrillo and El 
Mayel had already been arrested but were released by state 
police agents, allegedly by deputy prosecutor Sergio Ortiz Lara 
himself. Ortiz Lara is currently under arrest for his alleged 
responsibility in this case. 
  The most recent victim here of the drug trafficking groups 
was Federico Benitez Lopez, director of Municipal Security 
Police, and his driver Alarid Cardenas, who were murdered 10 
days ago on the highway in La Mesa. Benitez Lopez became known 
for the confiscation of weapons and marijuana in that city. 
  Benitez Lopez held that post for five months, when the drug 
trafficking phenomena was to be attacked in a joint action on 
three government levels. Nevertheless, the plans failed due to 
the rivalries among the different police corps and the 
corruption spread by the distribution of dollars by organized 
crime. 
  The large drug cargoes that reach this border have resulted 
in a peculiar phenomena: San Diego California drug addicts come 
to trade weapons for drugs. This was reported by David Rubi, 
chief of the Tactical Group, who affirmed that weekly a weapon 
known as a goat's horn [cuerno de chivo] is found in the hands 
of gang members in this city's poor neighborhoods.

<F P=106> [Report by Gabriela Hernandez] </F>
  [Text] Ciudad Victoria -- Tamaulipas Attorney General Raul 
Morales Cadena gave assurances yesterday that Juan Garcia 
Abrego's gang, known as the Matamoros Cartel, has shifted its 
center of operations to Monterrey. "In fact the Matamoros Cartel 
no longer exists in Tamaulipas; it has transferred to Nuevo 
Leon," the attorney general said. "In Matamoros the Garcia 
Abrego gang has been totally dismembered. Even the PGR 
[Attorney General's Office] is looking for them in Monterrey 
instead of Matamoros because it is known that they have 
transferred to that city." 
  Garcia Abrego, leader of the Matamoros Cartel, is one of the 
drug traffickers most wanted at present by Mexican and U.S. 
authorities. His gang has been accused of over 60 homicides and 
is known as one of the Cali Cartel's leading connections in the 
cocaine trade. 
  The attorney general said that only third-rate drug 
traffickers remain in Matamoros, where violent drug-related 
incidents are growing less frequent. "In Matamoros," he said 
"all that is left are memories of the Oliverio Chavez Araujo 
gang; what we have now are third-rate drug traffickers who are 
struggling for territory." 
  He pointed out that the special operations initiated last 
year by the PGR forced the gangs to flee to other cities where 
it would be more difficult to identify them. "The PGR has 
continued its operations and investigations in Matamoros," he 
said, "but we presume that Garcia Abrego's center of operations 
is now in Monterrey." 
  Morales Cadena believes that the Matamoros Cartel 
transferred 
to Monterrey and is operating in that city because several of 
Garcia Abrego's top lieutenants have been spotted there. Jose 
Carlos Resendez was arrested in Monterrey last week; he is 
considered one of the Matamoros Cartel capo's money launderers. 
  The attorney general also said that last week a residence in 
the Del Salle neighborhood in Monterrey was seized from Raul 
Valladares del Angel, who is believed to be one of Garcia 
Abrego's partners. Valladares del Angel has been a fugitive ever 
since he escaped from jail in Cameron County, Texas, last year. 
  The attorney general explained that the transfer of cartel 
operations is evident in the Matamoros homicide rate, which 
dropped 50 percent during the first quarter as compared to the 
same period in 1993. "Most significantly, 60 percent of the 
homicides perpetrated on the border used to be drug-related, but 
thus far this year we have only discovered drug connections in 
four murders," he said.

<F P=106> [By Juan Jose Coello] </F>
  [Text] The PGR [Attorney General's Office] described Nuevo 
Leon as a narco-dollar laundering capital after discovering that 
about 70 alleged businessmen have approximately $4 billion 
invested in area industries and businesses. 
  A high-ranking PGR official disclosed that an investigation 
of money laundering in Nuevo Leon began by presidential order in 
1991 and has not concluded. 
  "We have fully identified about 70 businessmen who live in 
Monterrey and have investments in Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, and 
Tamaulipas," the official said. 
  "Each drug trafficker we investigated led us to other people 
involved. What were believed to be simple covers turned out to 
be part of a gigantic money laundering network of international 
proportions" the interviewed officer said. 
  All of those involved are directly connected with the 
Matamorros Jail, and their leader is Juan Garcia Abrego, the 
officer added. 
  The mafia's money, he said, is invested primarily in 15 
types 
of industries and businesses. 
  "There are narco-businessmen in construction, 
telecommunications, automobile dealerships, real estate, and 
medium-sized export and foundry companies," he said. 
  He added: "There is also some involvement in art agencies, 
travel agencies, transportation, buildings, finance companies, 
the media, electronics purchases and sales, cattle ranching, 
investments, and air cargo." 
  The PGR official said that there are specific cases where 
only a few of the partners in a consortium have committed the 
crime, not every business partner. 
  The results of the huge investigation, he added, have just 
now been made public, and he guessed that this is only the 
beginning of a long chain of arrests and searches. 
  "These investigations have been the most complicated the PGR 
has had to face during this six-year term," the source said. 
  Some of the businessmen involved in narco-dollar money 
laundering have left a trail and been identified, and there is 
evidence against them. 
  "These are people from middle-class families who are 
suddenly 
millionaires overnight. They make their first appearance in 
society as owners of gigantic businesses," he said. 
  According to the high-ranking official, the businessmen 
involved in money laundering are known to everyone. They appear 
in newspapers, create publicity for themselves, and enjoy much 
prestige. 
  "They obey all laws, pay taxes, keep their bank accounts in 
good order, request loans pretending to have financial problems, 
and even go to church," he said. 
  "They keep everything in order except their business money 
comes from drug trafficking," the official said.

  [Excerpt] Hermosillo, Sonora, 20 April--A shipment of 
nearly a ton of cocaine was seized early this morning at the PGR 
[Attorney General's Office] checkpoint set up at Km 120 north of 
this town. The announcement was made by Miguel Angel Cortes 
Ibarra, the PGR's circuit representative. 
  The federal official added that these drugs were concealed 
under a load of pine logs arriving from the southern part of the 
country, and were bound for a site in the state's northern 
section. 
  The drugs were being transported on a gray Kenworth tractor 
trailer truck with Federal Public Service [SPF] plates 660-AT-1, 
hitched to a red flatbed carrying SPF plates 371-TXS. The 
information concerning the driver was not disclosed, so as to 
avoid interfering with the pertinent investigation [passage

  [Text] When they arrested four members of an international 
drug trafficking ring, including one Frenchman, in Quintana Roo 
State, Federal Judicial Police agents confiscated over 40 liters 
of hashish in the town of Cancun. It is estimated that the drugs 
seized, which required the processing of 40 tons of marijuana to 
produce, had a market value exceeding 150 million new pesos. 
  Information obtained from the PGR's [Office of the Attorney 
General of the Republic] assistant attorney's office for local 
branches and inspection, headed by Alfonso Cabrera Morales, has 
revealed that the French citizen, Herder Falaizer Bober, and the 
Mexicans, Ismael Serrano Lopez, Ismael Adame Switeer, and Jose 
Dolores Garcia, are at the disposal of the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office. The group had a shipment of 40.7 liters of 
hashish in its possession. 
  The preliminary investigations reveal that those presumed 
guilty, who have made confessions regarding the charges brought 
against them by the social representative, were arrested in a 
domicile on the corner of Lazaro Cardenas and Ninos Heroes 
Streets, in the municipality of Cancun's Colonia Puerto Morelos. 
The probe has been intensified in that locality. 
  It is recorded in preliminary investigation No. 50/94 that 
the confiscated drugs presumably were to be taken by land and 
air to the country's northern border. They were contained in two 
plastic kegs, each with a 20-liter capacity, and one bottle. 
Experts on the subject are still analyzing the hashish to 
determine its degree of purity. 
  According to the police authorities, headed by the Attorney 
General's Office representative in that state, Jose Luis Farrera 
Olmedo, the captured traffickers are presumed to be members of a 
criminal organization operating on an international scale. They 
must have processed at least 40 tons of marijuana to procure the 
hashish, which "most assuredly was bound for the neighboring 
country to the north for sale and consumption." 
  Giving further details on the incident, the Attorney 
General's Office reported that the police agents assigned to the 
case are primarily seeking, in the same town, the clandestine 
laboratory in which the marijuana was processed. They are also 
attempting to learn where the public poisoners obtained it. 
  It was learned that the investigation has been extended to 
Guerrero and Tabasco States, of which the Frenchman's 
accomplices are natives. It is considered quite likely that 
these individuals sent the cannabis indica to Quintana Roo, and 
that it certainly was processed there. However, there is a rumor 
that this processing occurred in Cozumel, where police personnel 
also have been detailed.

  [Text] Lima, 9 May (EFE) -- Peruvian drug trafficker 
Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," today charged 
before a congressional committee that military officers ranked 
as high as captain were involved in his illegal activities in 
the Upper Huallaga jungle region. 
  "Vaticano's" revelations were disclosed today by Congressman 
Julio Castro Gomez, chairman of the congressional committee on 
drug trafficking, who--along with other members of the 
committee--interrogated the drug trafficker in his cell at the 
Callao port naval base, where he is serving a 30-year sentence. 
  Castro quoted "Vaticano" as saying that he carried out his 
narcotrafficking activities "with the acquiescence and 
collaboration" of personnel ranked as high as captain from the 
Punta Arenas military post in the jungle department of San 
Martin. 
  "Vaticano," who is considered to be the main Peruvian drug 
trafficker, noted that he had received "collaboration and 
protection" from these Army personnel in building a clandestine 
airfield in Campanilla and carrying out his overall drug 
trafficking activities between 1990 and 1992, in exchange for a 
$5,000 payment for each drug shipment. 
  Colombian planes that came to pick up cocaine paste were 
landing at and taking off from the Campanilla airfield. 
  "Vaticano" was considered to be the main Peruvian supplier 
for the "Cali cartel." 
  "Vaticano" also told the congressmen that civilian 
authorities, such as the mayor of Campanilla, were aware of his 
activities. 
  According to Castro, "Vaticano" denied allegations that he 
was linked to the Shining Path terrorist gang or that he was 
forced to make payments to the subversive group to be able to 
carry out his drug trafficking operations. Castro added: 
"Vaticano" even noted that some of his men had clashed with the 
terrorists. 
  Castro added that "Vaticano" did not identify the officers 
he 
claimed to have bribed. 
  Castro reported that "Vaticano" was questioned for more than 
four and a half hours, and that he told the committee that he 
had informed drug enforcement police and antiterrorist police 
about his connections with military and civilian authorities. 
  "Vaticano" was first sentenced to life by a military court 
on 
charges of treason against the fatherland for having supplied 
weapons and food to Shining Path. His sentence was reduced last 
week to 30 years in light of evidence that he had not 
participated either in murders or as a leader of the terrorist 
organization. 
  "Vaticano" is also facing a civil lawsuit for his 
involvement 
in drug trafficking activities.

<F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez, from the "Investigative Unit"] </F>
  [Text] A report issued by the Interior Ministry General 
Intelligence Directorate (Digimin) last February states that the 
arrest and imprisonment of Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, 
aka "Vaticano" has not curtailed drug trafficking activities. 
  The document states that the creation of new drug stocking 
and dispatch centers, and the transference of drug "firms" to 
new areas is due to the repressive action of the security forces. 
  The report states that Colombian Waldo Simeon Vargas Arias, 
aka "El Ministro," and the Cachique Rivera brothers from Huanuco 
have occupied the void left by "Vaticano" by increasing their 
operations. 
  "Vaticano's" organizations have not been totally dismantled 
because they are now controlled by his brother Elias Chavez 
Penaherrera, aka "Cristo." 
  The Digimin report states: "Even though `Vaticano' was 
sentenced to life imprisonment, trafficking increased in Peru 
demonstrating that the organizations and `firms' involved in 
this illegal activity can modify their procedures and change 
their areas of action to avoid being detected." The report was 
distributed to the Armed Forces Joint Command, the National 
Intelligence Service, the Navy, Army, and Air Force Intelligence 
Directorates, and other agencies. 
  The main areas to where the traffickers have moved to avoid 
enforcement actions and to resume their businesses are the 
Tambopata Basin in Madre de Dios, on the border with Brazil, and 
in the northeastern jungle, specifically in Loreto and Ucayali. 
  According to the Digimin document, the "firms" that are 
massively installed in Tambopata Basin use Cusco peasants "to 
transport coca from the Amparaes and Lares valleys (Calca 
Province), Huaros (Quispicanchis Provinces), and Quillabamba (La 
Convencion Province), on a `small scale' basis, by land (road 
and rail) to Juliaca (Puno)." 
  The same "firms" which have turned Boca Manu into one of its 
operations center also collect coca from the higher zones of 
Puno. These leaves "are allegedly processed in maceration pits 
in riverside areas in these provinces and in inaccessible zones 
of Juliaca, where basic and washed coca paste as well as cocaine 
hydrochloride are allegedly being manufactured. This drug is 
then transported by land and sold for consumption in Cusco, 
Arequipa, Moquegua, Tacna, Ica, and Lima as well as in Argentina 
and Chile." 
  The presence of trafficking gangs in the Tambopata Basin, 
Loreto, and other places that will be mentioned later is due to 
the combined action of the Army, National Police, and the DEA in 
Upper Huallaga. 
  Experts warned that the implementation of antinarcotics 
policies based on repression would scatter the "firms" but not 
destroy them. 
  Interior Ministry analysts also acknowledge this, admitting 
that the mafias in Madre de Dios mostly come from the Upper 
Huallaga and Ucayali, especially from Aguaytia and particularly 
from Tambopata River Basin "given its geographical location and 
scarce" police and military "control." 
  The same point of view is expressed in the conclusions of 
the 
document which states: "The pressure exerted by the forces of 
order has caused trafficking activity to (...) move further 
away." 
  Madre de Dios is now "the main stocking center of basic and 
washed coca paste produced in northeastern Peru, as are Cusco 
and Puno, from where it is then transported abroad (to Brazil 
and Colombia)." 
  The "firms" have also moved to the Maranon River Basin from 
the Upper Mayo Valley in San Martin Department, from where they 
send drugs to Chiclayo, Trujillo, Piura, and Tumbes through 
Chiclayo, Olmos, Jaen, Bagua, Rioja, and Moyobamba. 
  The report states that "coca paste production was observed 
to 
have increased gradually there as well as greater stocking in 
Nueva Cajamarca (Rioja and Moyobamba). This increase is 
reflected both in the domestic market (small scale trade) and 
abroad (transported to Ecuador)." 
  The trade, transportation, and manufacturing of drugs has 
increased in these areas, particularly in Celendin, Cajamarca, 
and Luya, Amazon Department, "where Colombian and other foreign 
small planes are observed in the airport of Luya which is 
allegedly the export shipment center." 
  The organization left by "Vaticano," which is now controlled 
by his brother Elias Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Cristo," is 
allegedly protected by the Shining Path in the Huallaga River 
Basin. 
  The document adds that the "firms" have increased their 
operational levels in Ucayali, especially in Ayatala and Padre 
Abad Provinces and in the towns of Tamaya and Pachitea where 
basic and washed coca paste are manufactured to then transfer it 
to Pichis Palcazu from where it allegedly is transported to 
Brazil. 
  Recent antinarcotic operations in Pichis Palcazu forced the 
"firms" out toward Zona Balta, Puerto Esperanza, and San 
Bernardo, in Puros Province, Ucayali. 
  Just two weeks ago, LA REPUBLICA published a report on 
activities in the Pichis Palcazu valley. We discovered that the 
area had been turned into a new operations center by traffickers 
who previously operated in Upper Huallaga. 
  Regarding the Apurimac-Ene Basin, the document says: "Coca 
producing peasants in the Ene and Perene River valleys, in 
Satipo Province, Junin, and Pichis Palcazu-Oxampampa Province, 
in Pasco; as well as peasants from the Apurimac River valleys in 
Huanta and La Mar Provinces, Ayacucho, and Conception Province, 
in Cusco, have increased their plantations. In these zones 
traffickers have involved coca producers in their illegal trade. 
Peasants now build maceration pits near rivers and are 
manufacturing basic and washed coca paste." 
  The drug that is produced here, with that sent from 
Huallaga, 
is traded in Palmapampa in the Apurimac valley. This is the 
"main collection center. From here drugs for domestic 
consumption are distributed by land to the capital and other 
important cities (Huancayo, Pisco, Ica, Arequipa, Cusco) and 
shipped toward the Colombian and Brazilian borders by air." 
  Clandestine strips for shipping drugs have been fully 
identified in Luisiana, Palmapampa, Palestina, Puerto Mayo, 
Valle Esmeralda, and Iscozazin. 
  Digimin analysts said there are Army and Air Force bases 
near 
the clandestine strips of Luisiana and Palmapampa but the other 
strips are not controlled at all. 
  Trafficking activities have increased in the so-called 
central axis--comprising roads leading to Lima and the main 
coastal, central, and southern cities--particularly in Ica. 
  One of the projections being handled by Digimin is that 
"trafficking organizations will try to counter their recent 
setbacks by creating new centers of collection and shipping, 
thus spreading the police coverage and reducing their 
efficiency." 
  Another option being analyzed by experts is that 
"trafficking 
organizations, due to the quality of the coca in Huallaga, will 
continue to evade police controls by transporting the drug by 
land or by river to areas outside the control of the forces of 
order and close to airstrips that have been abandoned or are not 
controlled. Here the drug can be manufactured and shipped 
abroad." 
  The document does not specify the amount of drugs 
transported 
by the "firms," the number of drug flights, or the number of 
military or police personnel who cooperate with traffickers. 
  The report says, however, that interdiction has increased 
sharply. During February the police seized 186 kg of cocaine, 
3,713 kg of washed coca paste, and 8 kg of cocaine and arrested 
245 individuals in 119 operations, most of them in the Maranon 
basin. 
  The antinarcotic forces are now seeking to capture and 
disable the organizations headed by Waldo Vargas Arias and the 
Cachique Rivera brothers. 
  "(Vaticano's) capture has left a gap which his main 
competitors, `El Ministro' and the Cachique Rivera brothers, are 
seeking to exploit," the report states. 
  Both "firms" work for the powerful Cali cartel, which is 
responsible for 80 percent of the drugs entering the United 
States. 
  The police have hit the Cachique Rivera group the hardest: 
Five houses in Lima were raided, four laboratories were 
destroyed, and 15 accomplices were arrested. Just one month ago 
Antinarcotics Directorate officials captured Margarita Cachique 
Rivera--the "firm's" contact with foreign buyers in Lima and who 
guaranteed the supply of precursors to elaboration centers in 
the jungle. 
  "El Ministro" once again escaped from a combined police, 
Army, and DEA operation in Lagunas, Loreto Department, during 
March: He has an airstrip in the area.

<F P=106> [Article signed "J.A.M.": "Drug `Capos' and Families in </F>
Peru"] 
  [Text] Recent reports from the DIRANDRO [National Antidrug 
Division of the PNP (Peruvian National Police)] and the DEA 
[Drug Enforcement Administration] confirm the fact that, since 
the capture of Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, the control of the 
drug traffic in the Peruvian jungle is now being exercised by 
two firms: that of the "Cachique [also spelled "Cachiche"] 
Rivera Brothers," and that of "El Ministro." 
  Each of these large firms has the family of il 
capo [the chief] as a basic core of its structure, in the 
Italian Mafia style. 
  However, in the case of the drug traffickers' firms, the 
chief's blood relatives are, in fact, the basic elements. 
  There are plenty of examples. The pivotal element in the 
"Vaticano" firm is the Chavez Penaherrera family. The Cardenas 
family has continued to develop in a business left to it by the 
chief of the "Mosca Loca" clan. 
<H5>  Cachique Rivera Brothers </H5>
  The leadership of this group is held by Abelardo Cachique 
Rivera, who uses two aliases: "El Negro" or "Teniente." 
  The other members of the family involved in the business 
are: 
Segundo Gaudencio, aka "Capitan"; Nicolas, aka "Mayor"; and 
Adolfo, aka "Alferez." The firm's staff also includes one of the 
sisters, Margarita, and the father himself, Gaudencio Cachique 
Sajami. 
  The family has two trusted confidants: Wildoro Vargas 
Fasanando and Claudio Fernandez. The latter, known by the alias 
"Kilo" or "Gordo Kilo," is responsible for collecting the money 
produced by drug sales in Lima. 
  The Cachique Rivera brothers have something of which no 
other 
firm can currently boast: the support and backing of the "Cali 
Cartel." 
  Abelardo Cachique has been the only Peruvian drug trafficker 
called upon by that cartel's "capos" to revise the strategy for 
transferring drugs from Peru to Colombia. 
  The brothers themselves are providing the Cali Cartel with 
information on the Peruvian firms' degree of reliability. 
Furthermore, it is the Cachique brothers' responsiblity to carry 
out any settlement of accounts decided by the Colombians. 
  Another exclusive role of this firm stipulated by the 
Colombian Mafia is the monopoly for installing cocaine 
hydrochloride processing laboratories in Peru. The Colombians 
provide the materials at low prices. 
  The Cali Cartel capos discovered to have relations 
with the Peruvian firms are Francisco Herrera, Fernando Estrefa, 
and the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers. 
  Known as a collaborator of the Cali Cartel in Peru is Edwin 
Vela, a resident of Aucayacu. Vela is coordinating the flights 
to Cali with an individual known as "El Hawaiano." 
  The Cali Cartel has recently put the following type of 
insurance for its consignments into effect: The Peruvian firms 
implicated must give the cartel in advance, as a guarantee, a 
shipment of 50 kg of pure cocaine basic paste. Any shortage 
found upon receipt of the shipment is deducted from that deposit. 
  Not only that, the supplier firm must send a personal 
representative to the cartel. That person must pay with his life 
if the firm should default. 
  It has been learned from a police source that, right now, 
the 
cartel has in captivity the representative of a firm that failed 
to send the total shipment within the time period promised. 
  Until last year, the Cachique Riveras's center of operations 
had been established in the Pozuzo-Oxapampa-Pasco zone. They 
acquired an extensive area in Yuya Pichis, near Pichis Palcazu. 
  As for the organization of the firm's henchmen, their 
mission 
was limited mainly to providing personal protection for the 
family clan, and to ensuring the security of the flights. 
  In January of this year, however, after "Vaticano's" arrest, 
Abelardo Cachique decided to purchase 30 FAL rifles and to 
increase the security force to 36 men. 
  In 1993, the firm had a network of five houses in Lima, 
worth 
$500,000 and located in upper class neighborhoods: two in the La 
Encantada and La Campina de Chorrillos urban complexes; two more 
in San Borja (Breton and Tiziano Streets); and a last one in El 
Sol de la Molina. 
  As the police have discovered, this year members of the firm 
have spent the night at a residence in the Miguel Grau de 
Salamanca urban complex (Chanchaque Street, block H, lot 17), in 
Lima. 
<H5>  Deceased Members </H5>
  Between 1990 and 1993, several drug trafficking associates 
of 
the Cachique Riveras met with strange deaths. Here are a few of 
them: those known by the aliases "Satanas" and "Peaje"; Juan 
Davila, aka "Clavo," who died in Lima; and "Negro Soto," a 
Colombian with whom Abelardo Cachique was running drugs from 
Saposoa to Aucayacu. 
  For two years, from 1990 to 1992, the firm had the Pampas 
Yurac-Aguaytia-Ucayali zone as a collection center. Two or three 
flights were taking off from there weekly, bound for Colombia. 
  During that same interval, the hideouts for washing the 
paste 
were located in Boca de Santa Ana, Aguaytia, and 
Carachama-Ucayali. A short time later, another was equipped in 
the Pozuzo River valley. 
  Both this year and last, the Cachique Riveras have been 
using 
Boca Manu and Madre de Dios as sites for shipping to Colombia 
via Brazil. They have had the authorized runway in Madre de Dios 
at their disposal. 
  During 1990, they were using km 19 of the Marginal Highway 
for this purpose. They put the Sacramento and Libertad sections 
of the Federico Basadre Highway to the same use. During 1992 and 
1993, the drugs were shipped to Colombia leaving from the Pozuzo 
River bend. 
  This year, they have been using clandestine airstrips 
constructed in La Union and Barranca, in the Biabo River valley. 
The drugs are run from there to the mouth of the Manu River, at 
which point they are shipped to Colombia. 
  Although it does not appear as a shareholder, the Cachique 
Rivera firm owns an aerotaxi company that runs drugs from 
Aucayacu, Palmapampa, Bellavista, and Pichis Palcazu, according 
to a DEA report. 
  It was said that, because of the police harassment, Abelardo 
Cachique Rivera had taken refuge in Colombia. However, reliable 
sources claim that he is currently traveling freely through San 
Francisco, Palmapampa, Atalaya, and Puerto Prado (on the edge of 
the Ayacucho jungle). 
  At exactly 1630 last Wednesday, 29 March, a small plane 
chartered as an air express carrier by Abelardo Cachique Rivera 
was intercepted by FAP [Peruvian Air Force] Tucano aircraft 
assigned to the 42nd Air Group based in Pucallpa. 
  While flying along the Ucayali River, the small plane, with 
registration OB-9066, belonging to TATSA (Tarapoto Air 
Transport), was forced to land at the Iquitos airport. Having 
arrived from Palmapampa and San Francisco, it was flying with 
Islandia, on the Ayaviri River (at the Brazilian border), as its 
destination. 
  No drugs were found on the plane, but the sum of $435,000 
was 
discovered. The police arrested the Colombian citizens Marcelino 
Lesmes, Jhon Hayru, Anibal Palomares, and Martha Garcia. Two of 
them were reported to be chemists from the Cachique Rivera firm. 
<H5>  "El Ministro" </H5>
  It is currently the number two firm. In this instance also, 
the type of firm organized on the basis of a family clan appears 
to have been implemented. The chief is Waldo Vargas Arias, alias 
"El Ministro." The second in command of the organization is his 
brother, as yet known only by the nickname "Samurai." 
  Vargas Arias began developing his business in 1988, from a 
hideout set up in the locality of Uchiza, opposite the "Gallos 
del Sol" shed. He later ran drugs from various sites in Huallaga 
(Paraiso, Progreso, Alto Manteca, and Puerto Pizana) to Bajo 
Huallaga (Chazuta, Pongo Isla, Huimbayoc, Yarina Pelejo, and 
Navarro), all areas with clandestine runways. 
  During 1993, he moved his center of operations to the 
locality of Lagunas, with an airstrip at his disposal. This 
year, he has been using those in Yarina and Pelejos; but he 
recently decided to take over the Bonilla and Yumbatos airfields 
in the near future. 
  According to the DEA, Waldo Vargas has at least one small 
plane from the Halcon, S.A., aerotaxi company at his disposal. 
The source even gives the aircraft's registration number: 
OB-1229, and the pilot's descriptive name, "Mucura." "El 
Ministro's" front men in this firm are said to be the brothers 
Miguel and Carlos Farro Perez. Carlos Farro's sister-in-law, 
Isolina Mansilla, is "El Ministro's" housemate. He was captured 
with her in Pongo Isla. 
  "Jilguero" is in charge of all security matters. His other 
nickname is "Martin." He is the military trainer of the 
henchmen, among whom "Pirulin" is notorious for his 
cold-bloodedness. 
  The police have managed to learn the specific names of 
several of the firm's collaborators: Edgardo Castillo, William 
Garzon, Jhon Gonzales, Jose Landazuri, and Ali Gonzales, of 
Colombian nationality. The Peruvians include: Jose Pena Saldana, 
Fernando Saldana Chavez, and Gonar Garcia Guerra. 
  "El Ministro" is a long-standing ally of the terrorist 
groups. At one time he was with the MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] members in Sauce; and, on another 
occasion, with the patrol groups in Huimbayoc and Navarro, in 
Bajo Huallaga. He is currently with the SL's [Shining Path 
members] in Lagunas. 
  "Samurai", "El Ministro's" brother, has just recruited 
subversives who have contributed weapons (FAL's and others). 
This heightened fire-power has enabled his group to subjugate 
other small firms. 
  Smaller firms collaborating with him are those of "Canario," 
"El Profe" in Pongo de Caynarachi, and "Ojitos" in Huimbayoc. 
  Some sources claim that he is operating with the Cali 
Cartel, 
specifically, with the Rodriguez Orejuela family. 
  Ten days ago, the police came close to capturing him near 
Yurimaguas. The areas in which he is known to be currently 
moving are Huimbayoc, Yarina, and Lagunas, where he is always 
followed by six heavily armed henchmen.

  [Text] Lima, 12 May (EFE) -- The Defense Ministry today 
reported the arrest of nine members of the Maoist Shining Path 
[SL]. They were captured during an antisubversive Army 
operation in the northern Peruvian jungle from 6 to 9 May. 
  Among those arrested are three women and the governor of 
Punchao village who tried to bribe Army members to free two of 
the arrested subversives. 
  The Defense Ministry communique points out that an SL group 
occupied Cachicoto settlement on 7 May, murdered a 
"narco-terrorist," and seized 150 kg of cocaine base and $90,000. 
  These events occurred in Huanuco and San Martin Departments 
in the northern Peruvian jungle.

  [Text] Military analysts agree that an armed confrontation 
between the Shining Path [SL] and the MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] is "in the making" in the jungle area of 
Junin Department. The analysts added that under the present 
circumstances, there is bound to be a struggle for the control 
of drug trafficking areas in Padre Abad, Ucayali; Oxapampa and 
Gran Pajonal in the Pasco jungle; and in Chachamayo and Satipo 
in the jungle area of Junin Department. 
  The analysts explained that it is essential for the two 
extremist organizations to keep their control over coca-growing 
areas because that is where their dollars come from. This 
income ensures the survival of the two armed groups, and keeps 
them ready for combat. The experts, however, pointed out a 
significant difference between the two groups. 
  The information obtained from a repentant soldier indicated 
that Shining Path leaders keep resources and funds under tight 
control, and issue rations to their men that keep them hungry. 
Shining Path extremists are poorly fed, and get the same food 
ration for months. 
  "Jairo," one of the first repentants who surrendered at the 
Mazamari military base two years ago, made this decision because 
he was tired of the rampant corruption among the leaders. 
According to "Jairo," the "lower ranks" ate corn mash while the 
leaders ate canned food and drank whiskey, which they obtained 
from drug traffickers in the jungle area of San Francisco, 
Ayacucho Department. 
  The internal situation of the MRTA is different. The MRTA 
pays salaries to its militants to stop them from running away, 
which turns them into paid mercenaries. 
  Thus, the two groups clearly rely on support from drug 
traffickers, but there is a difference between them. The MRTA 
structure seems to be more fragile. As soon as the flow of drug 
money is cut, the organization will collapse because the 
combatants would refuse to fight if there is no booty to share. 
  The Shining Path is probably not as dependent on drug money 
because the leaders can actually force the soldiers to fight, 
but the involvement is much more deeply rooted. The Shining 
Path is seriously jeopardized by the way in which drugs and drug 
money have corrupted its political and military leaders, who 
some time ago used to take pride in their austerity. 
  According to the sources, when Shining Path militants showed 
up in Padre Abad, fleeing after the defeat of the Mar Rojo 
battalion on the banks of the Huallaga River, and joined other 
Shining Path forces in the province, the MRTA started having 
problems, and must now unleash a sustained offensive. 
  The analysts even predicted that the MRTA will oust the 
Shining Path from Padre Abad Province and will take over Shining 
Path hideouts in the region. The analysts also announced the 
MRTA will try to do the same thing in Oxapampa and Gran Pajonal, 
in the jungle area of Pasco, where the MRTA has a platoon (one 
platoon has between 20 and 30 men), and in Pichis Palcazu. 
Another MRTA platoon is operating in the area attacked a convoy 
with draftees near Villa Rica a few days ago. 
  The analysts explained, however, that the largest MRTA 
contingent is operating in Satiop, Perene, and Parihuanca in the 
jungle area of Junin Department. There, the MRTA has three 
well-armed platoons that have been stopping and robbing vehicles 
along the Marginal Highway and killing people. It would seem 
that these groups manage to blend with the local population 
after their raids. 
  The analysts confirm that the MRTA apparently managed to set 
up an operation in Huancayo to push out the Shining Path, which 
was again trying to extort money from farmers. In fact, on 26 
April the MRTA called a two-day "armed strike" in three jungle 
provinces, according to information received. The Huancayo 
police reported that strike "announcements" were painted on city 
walls. 
  The provinces where the MRTA is trying to compel the people 
to "strike" are Chanchamayo and Satipo in Junin Department, and 
in Oxapampa in Pasco Department. In the past only the Shining 
Path used to organize "armed strikes." 
  Even though certain analysts, whom the news agencies quote, 
seem to believe that this could mean a possible merger of the 
two subversive gangs, everything indicates that at least in the 
central jungle area, a clash between the two groups seems to be 
inevitable.

  [Text] On 27 April Congress unanimously approved prison 
sentences of no less than 8 and no more than 15 years as 
punishment for those who cultivate, promote, help with, or 
finance poppy plantations, including those who transfer or 
commercialize the seeds of this plant, which is the base product 
for heroin. 
  The bill, which was debated by the Justice Committee based 
on 
a draft submitted 2 months ago by the executive branch, 
establishes a prison sentence of no less that 2 and no more than 
8 years for those who commercialize poppy seeds that would 
produce less than 100 plants. 
  The bill also indicates that the poppy plantations that are 
destroyed "by any means, as long as they do not affect the 
preservation of the environment, must be done so under the 
control and responsibility of the provincial prosecutor, who 
must draft the appropriate document explaining the action." 
  The land used for cultivation, the equipment, and others 
things used directly to commit the crime will be seized, and as 
soon as the court hands down its sentence they will become the 
property of the Agricultural Ministry. 
  Referring to the land, this will preferably be awarded to 
campesinos without land, according to a clause of the bill that 
the president sent to Congress for approval. 
  Those who have committed this crime will not be eligible to 
take advantage of penitentiary benefits such as sentence 
reductions for work carried out or for helping in the 
educational sector; pardons; or semi-conditional or conditional 
release. 
  This bill is the first of its kind in scope, as it is a 
frontal attack against the proliferation of poppy plantations 
within the national territory. 
  At the beginning of the week EL COMERCIO revealed a report 
on 
the magnitude of illegal poppy cultivation, which is especially 
attractive for the drug traffickers because its derivatives 
(opium and heroin) fetch a much higher price than the illegal 
derivatives of the coca leaf.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Fight Against Drugs and 
Terrorism 
  We think police forces should be responsible for fighting 
drugs and terrorism. This is in accordance with our countries' 
internal order. We believe that to commit the Armed Forces as 
institutions to fighting these kinds of activities, before the 
bodies specifically created by the states for these functions 
are overwhelmed, is hasty and inappropriate for the development 
of the specific responsibilities that have been assigned to the 
armies. We maintain, however, a careful watch on those types of 
activities, in the sense that we continue to study the 
information available on those areas, and continue to plan for 
possible Army participation in the task, in the given case that 
the national government decides that we should intervene.

<F P=106> [Report by Alonso Zambrano] </F>
  [Text] The financial events that occurred in the country 
on Friday, when the U.S. dollar exchange rate closed at 124 
bolivares, alerted intelligence organizations that drug 
traffickers were offering dollars for between 80 and 100 
bolivares. Military intelligence sources are currently 
investigating the criminal activities carried out in Caracas, 
Maracaibo, Merida, San Cristobal, Puerto Ordaz, and Porlamar. 
  Confidential reports, which are being thoroughly 
investigated, warn about the presence of intermediaries used by 
leading cartels from the neighboring country, who reportedly 
offered dollars for between 80 and 100 bolivares, taking 
advantage of the confusion unleashed by a sudden increase in the 
dollar's value. The transactions involved attempts to launder 
large amounts of money that international drug organizations 
keep stashed along the Venezuelan border and introduce to the 
market in small amounts. 
  The confidential report talks about the mobilization of a 
considerable sum of "dirty" dollars resulting from drug 
operations carried out in Medellin, Cali, and Cucuta. The 
report indicates that, in a process like this, Venezuela is 
essential for illegal dollar transactions carried out by such 
criminal organizations.

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Eduardo Brando] </F>
  [Text] The militarization of the struggle against drugs as 
a priority of the Venezuelan state will be proposed to President 
Rafael Caldera, who will receive an analysis of the country's 
problem and an action plan to fight it. The plan was studied 
yesterday during a joint meeting between civilian and military 
organizations. 
  The secret conference at the Palacio Blanco was presided 
over 
by Division General Alberto Emerich Esqueda Torres (Army) and 
Brigadier General Jesus Antonio Rojas Salazar (National Guard), 
executive secretary and assistant secretary of the National 
Security and Defense Council (Seconasede), respectively; 
representatives of the Defense Ministry and National Border 
Council; and chiefs of narcotics in the Army, Navy, Air Force, 
and National Guard. 
  Dr Vladimir Gessen, former chairman of the Chamber of 
Deputies Drug Commission and chairman of the Foundation for a 
Drug-Free Venezuela, was invited to address the closed meeting. 
<H5>  THE CONTINENT'S PROBLEM </H5>
  In its initial analysis of the problem, Gessen's lecture 
referred to the basic factors of regional and continental 
security, including the production and processing in Peru, 
Bolivia, and Colombia of 1,170 tons of cocaine whose final 
destination is the U.S. market. 
  According to international organizations' figures, the 
production of this volume of drugs in those countries costs 
$5,000 per kilo, which represents an investment of $5.85 
billion. The average price on the U.S. wholesale market 
increases to $25,000 per kilo, which represents an approximate 
income of $29.835 billion. International drug trafficking 
organizations' profit margins fluctuate around these suggested 
amounts. 
  Moreover, the overall volume per year, approximately 1,170 
tons, has another angle of benefits for the cartels. When the 
drug is "cut," through mixtures that reduce its level of purity, 
the volume increases to 1,649,700 kg. 
  Calculations on the illegal activity indicate the retail 
sale 
of that amount for an average price of $98 per gram yields 
traffickers an income of approximately $161,670,600 per year. 
Meanwhile, other drugs yield them an income of approximately 
$90,113,212 per year. In other words, the U.S. market yields 
$251,783,812 per year. The volume sent to the United States 
represents 75 percent of the Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia 
cartels' annual production; and the remaining 25 percent is sent 
to the European markets. 
<H5>  VENEZUELA'S SITUATION </H5>
  In Venezuela's case, it is estimated that 200 tons of drugs 
are brought to the country every year. Based on production 
costs, this represents approximately $1 billion. But once the 
drug reaches the U.S. market, the amount increases to $5.1 
billion. 
  The following give an idea of the importance of shipments 
that pass through the national territory: 1) A shipment of 
concrete poles was seized at the United States (Miami) in 
December 1991. The poles contained 15,700 kg of cocaine with a 
net cost of $78.5 million, approximately 10,754,500,000 
bolivares (at the exchange rate quoted during the last quarter 
of 1993). An additional 2,700 kg of drugs, with an approximate 
value of $13.5 million (1,849,500,000 bolivares) and hidden 
inside some aluminum ingots, were seized in New Jersey in 
December that same year. 
  Another shipment of aluminum poles was intercepted at 
Holland 
in February 1994. The structures contained 3,000 kg of cocaine 
valued at approximately $15 million (2.055 billion bolivares). 
The confiscation of other contraband in England was reported in 
April. The drug was hidden inside crude oil drums and had an 
approximate value of $375 million (51.375 billion bolivares). 
  Reports received this month indicate a drug laboratory 
dismantled in Cucuta, on the Venezuelan border, maintained 
average production of 400 kg of cocaine per week, meaning 20,800 
kg per year, at an average value of $104 million. 
<H5>  A STATE PRIORITY </H5>
  These issues were reportedly reviewed during the meeting 
attended by the state's high-ranking drug and security 
officials, who believe the problem should be handled as such. 
Regarding this issue, they discussed the possibility and 
advisability of assigning an Army division general as chairman 
of the National Commission Against Illegal Drug Use (Conacuid). 
This would clearly indicate the importance and essence of the 
problem for the country, and it would be an unequivocal sign to 
internal factors, foreign governments, and international 
organizations of the determination to face the problem as a 
threat to the Venezuelan state. 
  It was learned that the topics analyzed and proposals 
submitted on objectives, goals, and specific actions to be 
carried out at different periods would be briefed to the 
president of the republic yesterday afternoon, in a special 
report by Ministers Rafael Angel Montero Revette (defense) and 
Pompeyo Marquez (borders).

  [Summary] On 4 April at the Xinjiang Autonomous Region 
counternarcotics meeting, Vice Chairman Wang Lequan emphasized 
the serious nature of Xinjiang's narcotics problem. He noted 
that the counternarcotics effort is an urgent, long-term 
proposition. 
  According to Wang, despite some successes during the past 
three years, cultivation and trafficking of drugs have not been 
eliminated, and Xinjiang has seen the number of counties and 
cities with a drug trafficking problem increase from 40 to 53. 
In addition, traffickers have become better organized and 
developed more extensive networks, and their methods have become 
increasingly devious. Therefore, Xinjiang must improve its 
counternarcotics propaganda, and the region will focus its 
counternarcotics effort on cases involving large sums of money, 
trafficking routes and hubs, and deeply-involved criminals. At 
the same time, Xinjiang will counter scattered and sporadic 
trafficking, uncovering traffickers through patterns of drug use 
and destroying underground trafficking networks. Wang also 
stressed the development of a counternarcotics responsibility 
system involving the registration of drug users.

<F P=106> [Article by Prawit Rotchanaphruk: "Using Evil in the Fight </F>
for Freedom"] 
  [Text] Being responsible for [a] nation's political and 
external affairs is no easy task. It's even more difficult when 
that country not recognized by world communities, when one third 
of its land is under foreign occupation, and when that country 
has been at war for most [of] the last four decades. 
  The situation becomes even more complicated when the 
president of that country is on the US Drug Enforcement 
Administration's (DEA) most wanted list for narcotics-relate 
charges, and when the president's nickname is the "Opium King" 
or "Prince of Darkness". 
  It's a daunting task for anyone. However 46-year-old Khunsai 
Chaiyen, top political aide to Khun Sa, the self-proclaimed 
leader of the Shan State, takes it all in his stride. His pride 
in his state is visible in his bespectacled eyes. 
  "We Thai Yai (also known as Tai, the major ethnic group in 
the Shan State and a close relative of the Thai people) fought 
alongside the Burmese for independence from the British colonial 
masters. But in 1952 (four years after Burma gained 
independence) the Rangoon government sent its troops to invade 
and occupy the Shan State. And I grew up under the Burmese 
occupation." 
  Now as secretary of external affairs for the Shan State 
Restoration Council (SSRC), Khunsai is an old hand at local and 
external affairs. 
  It's been 25 years now since Khunsai first became involved 
with the revolutionary activities that eventually led to the 
unofficial independence in 1958 of the 160,000 square kilometres 
of land that make up Shan State, just north of Thailand. 
  Born to a merchant family in 1948 in the Nam San 
principality 
of Shan State, Khunsai was better off than the average Shan 
family. When the time came, he managed to pursue a university 
education in chemistry at the Mandalay Arts and Science 
University. But growing up under foreign occupation eventually 
raised many questions in the mind of the young student. 
  "I asked myself why the Thai Yai had to learn the Burmese 
language? Why the Burmese didn't like us to wear traditional 
Thai Yai pants? Why the Burmese enjoyed more civil rights than 
we did? Why many able Thai Yai people had to work under Burmese 
who were not as competent? And why we had to obey them?" 
  These many whys haunted him, and eventually Khunsai decided 
to become involved with anti-Burmese activities. However, it 
was not long before the authorities found out. 
  "I had to leave university after my third year of 
education," 
Khunsai recalled. His dreams of becoming a scientist were 
shattered. But a higher dream brought him to work for the Shan 
United Revolutionary Army (Sura). 
  Though he didn't excel in the military field, Khunsai was a 
witty, intelligent person, able to converse in English, Burmese, 
Thai Yai and Thai. He chose political work and soon the young 
Khunsai proved his pen was mightier than many men's swords as he 
speedily climbed the Sura ladder. 
  In the mid seventies, on the eastern side of the Shan State, 
another powerful Shan army, with money funded by heroin and 
opium trade, was growing under the control of Khun Sa. But 
soon, the uncontested Opium King who claimed to be a freedom 
fighter was pushed out of Ban Hin Taek in Mae Chan District of 
Chiang Rai province by the Royal Thai Army for being the US 
DEA's enemy number one. 
  Then in 1985 Khun Sa decided to join forces with Sura and 
make the little village of Ho Mong, just north of Mae Hong Son 
province, the new army base. Eventually Khun Sa became 
president of the SSRC and commander in chief of the Muang Tai 
Army [MTA] or the Army of the Tai Nation. 
  In the years that followed Khunsai became associated with 
Khun Sa and soon became his top political aide. He also saw Ho 
Mong, a sleepy village embraced on all sides by green mountain 
ranges, grow into a relatively modern town with 20,000 
civilians, electricity, a high school, dozens of shops, a 
karaoke bar, a 60-bed hospital and gem emporium. The village is 
also the base of the MTA, which, according to Khun Sa, boasts 
some 47,000 members, some armed with advanced Soviet-made 
weapons. The prosperous town has become the centre of Khunsai's 
hopes for independence. 
  But most of the town's wealth is not "clean" money. Despite 
recent attempts to capitalize on the Shan State's abundance of 
jade, rubies and blue sapphires, much of the state's wealth 
comes from the notorious opium plant. 
  "There are two things we do with opium and heroin," Khunsai 
said matter-of-factly. "First, we allow opium caravans or 
heroin refineries to be set up under our protection. Second, we 
collect taxes from them. We could have set up these refineries 
ourselves, but then they would be state owned, and that wouldn't 
be proper. So the private sector is taking care of it." 
  Khun Sa, according to critics, is--at least in 
part--responsible for the millions of people in the United 
States, Europe and Asia for whom drug addiction has ruined their 
lives. The Shan State is the world's major site for opium 
cultivation and heroin production. The top quality white powder 
heroin the state produces fetches up to US$200,000 (Bt [baht] 5 
million) per kilogram once it reaches the United States. That's 
20 times what the drug is worth on the streets of Bangkok. With 
such profits to be made, each year hundreds of million of 
dollars changes hands. 
  "Nobody wants to see opium and heroin, not even the growers 
themselves," said Khunsai defending his raison d'etre. "If 
there was peace in my country I would rather do something else. 
But we have to fight the Burmese, so who can we go to for 
money? Nobody is helping us, so what can we do? Please help me 
think about it too," he asked seriously. 
  "If the Bangkok Bank would loan me some money I would surely 
apply for it." 
  If opium is to be eliminated, said Khunsai, people must 
first 
know where it comes from. The secretary claimed that at one 
time, the Thai Yai grew one seventh of the total amount of opium 
produced in Shan State. But now, he said, almost all the ethnic 
groups in the state are involved with growing the deadly plant. 
  He pointed to three major reasons behind the surge in opium 
production. "The first and second reasons are that the now 
defunct Kuomintang (KMT) and the former Communist Party of Burma 
(CPB) encouraged local people to grow (opium). Third, the 
Rangoon government wanted to lay blame on us. They forced us in 
every way they could. So we had no choice but to depend on 
opium money. 
  "The KMT and CPB are now defunct, but the Burmese are still 
there. As long as they are still around (in the Shan State), it 
will be impossible to solve this issue. We must drive them 
out," he concluded. 
  But even if they succeed, Khun Sa's reputation may never 
change in the eyes of the world. While Khunsai regards his 
president as a man who can cope under all circumstances, Khun Sa 
can not evade the world's condemnation for his narcotic related 
activities. 
  "Making Khun Sa the Opium King is a political game," said 
Khunsai, defending his boss. We were unlucky that the DEA was 
formed with the least credible police the United States has 
known. They (the DEA) did it (put Khun Sa on their most wanted 
list) for their own benefit. 
  "Do you think they really want to arrest Khun Sa? If so, why 
is the prize for his head just Bt500.000? The sum... would not 
even cover a rich man's expenses for a year. All this means 
that the DEA wants Khun Sa to live so the DEA can get a bigger 
budget and hold on to their jobs." 
  Meanwhile, as the war with the Burmese drags on, Khunsai is 
attempting to change the world's attitude toward Khun Sa and the 
struggle for Shan independence. Khunsai said he was well aware 
that the longer the war continues, the more tears will be shed. 
  After four decades of war, thousands and thousands of young 
men have gone to the front line. Many never return. The MTA, 
in need of new recruits, will enlist another 4,000 soldiers this 
year, many as young as 16 and many of them conscripts. All 
families with a son are obliged to send at least one of their 
sons to serve in the MTA. 
  "Those under 16 are not eligible to be soldiers but they 
must 
undergo years of military preparation," he explained. "If they 
are 10 years old, they are ready to receive training, and they 
are strong enough to carry guns. 
  "These kids have strong hearts, they have always wanted to 
go 
to war. Once there was an order for these youngsters to march 
to the Salween River. 
  These kids thought they were finally going to fight, but 
they 
were disappointed once they realized they were only sent to 
carry wounded soldiers back on stretchers." 
  But through political maneuvering, Khunsai hopes speedy 
victory or independence will be achieved. "We are negotiating 
with different ethnic groups. The Wa (another large ethnic 
group situated on the northeastern side of the Shan State along 
the Shan-Chinese border) army will soon forge an alliance with 
us. The Burmese have used the Wa to attack us in the past. But 
that ploy is dwindling along with the strength of the Wa army. 
  "But it (the Burmese-Wa alliance) will not last long. The 
Burmese lack dollars so they hired the Wa to burn opium fields 
as a ploy to ploy to get money from the West and the Wa received 
rice in return. The Chinese government no longer wants to 
support the Wa. Over the past two or three months, the Burmese 
have cut down their supply of rice to the Wa army to 1,500 sacks 
per month, down from 4,000. 
  It's not enough and the Wa also know they are being used as 
a 
tool to earn Slorc (Burma's State Law and Order Restoration 
Council) some hard currency." Khunsai is also optimistic about 
the possibility of economic forging ties with Thailand. 
  "If businessmen come to trade with and develop the Shan 
State, all they will think about will be the profits. They 
won't think about the political issues, they just want to make 
money. So we forwarded a letter to His Majesty [HM] the King of 
Thailand saying it would best for His Majesty to initiate trade 
relations, as he is the symbol of unity not just for Thais, but 
for the greater Tai race. 
  "Aside from logging and fishing concessions, what will the 
Thais get from the Burmese? Nothing," he continued. "But 
gemstones and teak wood, are all in the Shan State. But our 
state is a landlocked nation. So if we want to find a sea 
route, which would be the best way? Through Thailand. The 
proposed Salween Dam and quadrangular economic sphere is also in 
the Shan State. Our two nations are of the same Tai race. 
Chinese trade with Chinese, so Thai should trade with Thai 
(Yai). We have all the raw materials, cheap labour and we can 
absorb small and medium scale industries from Thailand." 
  To date, no reply from HM the King has been received, 
however 
Khunsai still waits in hope. 
  At present, nearly 10,000 Burmese troops are also waiting on 
the west side of the Salween River. They are waiting to begin a 
major offensive drive before the rainy season arrives. The 
independence of the Shan State and its 8 million people is still 
far from being recognized by the United Nations and the price on 
the president's head remains in place. 
  But while the rain clouds will soon loom over Ho Mong, 
Khunsai holds tight to his faith. "I want to see Shan 
independence" he said. "But it won't come fast. Every day, I 
hear more and more cases of human rights violations committed by 
the Burmese. Many people in Burma are suffering. They were 
used (by Slorc) as vehicles to attain absolute power and then 
they were discarded and killed. I really want the ordeal to be 
over now." 
  Khunsai believes independence of the Shan State will happen 
during his lifetime. "It's 99 per cent certain," Khunsai 
predicted with an air of confidence. 
  But what about the remaining 1 per cent? 
  "The last 1 per cent," Khunsai replied, "depends on karma, 
on 
the good and bad deeds that all of the Thai Yai have committed. 
  "Lord Buddha must have lied to me if what I did was wrong," 
he said. "For all these 25 long years, all I have done was for 
my country."

<F P=106> [Interview with Khun Sa by Prawit Rotchanaphruk, Bunloet </F>
Siakim, and Dom Suwana; place, date not given] 
  [Text] The Burmese have made some advance and they 
are now on the western side of the Salween River, how do you see 
the situation? 
  I'm not worried at all if the Burmese could have crossed 
(the 
river) they would have done it. It's not that they have taken 
pity on us, or that we are their brothers, the fact is that they 
can't. I sleep peacefully at night and actually I really want 
them to cross (the river) to our side if they can so I can shoot 
them myself. 
  You see, the Salween River doesn't belong to the Burmese, it 
belongs to us--the Thai Yai. If Thais think about utilizing our 
four main rivers (Nam Salween, Nam Muang Phuek, Nam Muang Sat, 
Nam Muang Loi), the Thai brothers, the Thai millionaires and the 
Thais in the private sector should help Khun Sa a bit. Once we 
can stand up against the Burmese, we will drive them back to 
where they belong. And Thais can make use of the rivers. 
  How much area of the Shan State is under MTA (Muang Tai 
Army or the Army of the Tai Nation) influence? 
  We have control over two-thirds of the Shan state. 
  How do you look at the proposed quadrangular economic 
sphere that includes Burma, China, Laos and Thailand? Who do 
you think will really benefit from it? 
  I don't think of it as an economic road, it's a strategic 
road for the Chinese only. The Chinese have spent many hours 
thinking of ways to outsmart the Burmese, Laotians and Thais. 
The Chinese want to build a bridge across the Salween River and 
build railways so they can send their troops down to Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Shan state and Burma within 24 hours. It is 
not about the economy. 
  You have said that if the Thai government helps you, 
the MTA would surely defeat the SLORC (Burma's ruling State 
Order Restoration Council), can you elaborate? 
  I will push all the Burmese out of Shan state because they 
invaded us first, they also broke the Panglong treaty that 
recognized Shan independence. Because of all this, the MTA 
doesn't have to look for soldiers, men come willingly. These 
men voluntarily take arms to force the Burmese out. All we need 
are some arms and money. 
  The Burmese have only the rice and the sea to depend on, 
nothing else. All the rest of the natural resources that they 
are selling to foreigners belongs to us, the Thai Yai, so may I 
request everyone not to buy Burmese goods. Those goods actually 
belong to us, the Thai Yai. Once they get money, they buy guns 
to kill us. Thais and Tai (the other name for Thai Yai) are 
brothers. We share the same blood, the same King and Queen. If 
Shan gained independence, it would be another Tai state, and the 
name of His Majesty the King would be spread even further. 
Thais will trade with Tai, and the Thai economy will be even 
better. 
  Does this mean that once Shan gains independence, it 
will become part of Thailand? 
  No, not as such. 
  Besides other ethnic groups in Shan state, have you 
been negotiating with other armed minorities like Kayah, Karen 
or Mon about political and economic alliances? 
  I have delegated respective people to negotiate with the 
Karen and Kayah to come up with a draft constitution of the new 
confederation of states and to see if we can have an alliance of 
sort like the European Community. 
  Given the present situation, what are you most worried 
about? 
  There are only two things that worry me: money and arms, 
nothing more. 
  How do you view the combined income you derive from 
opium and heroin taxes that you collect and those from the sales 
of Shan's jade, ruby and sapphires in relation to the amount you 
spent to keep the MTA running? 
  That money is good for the purchase of our soldiers' boots 
only (laughs). 
  The United States government always tells all its 
allies that having any kind of relationship with Khun Sa is 
wrong. What do you think of your reputation as the King of 
Opium, the man who is responsible for the loss of millions of 
lives, especially in the United States, due to heroin? 
  The United States government sent someone to ask me about 
it. 
But I think they are crazy! And all they did was wrong. Now, 
they have realized that what they did in the past was wrong and 
they've started to talk with me. 
  What about the mass media? You are portrayed as an 
opium crook who causes millions of death. 
  The United States had also sent someone to ask me I told 
them 
that the killer is not me, but the US DEA. I do political work, 
I'm not an opium trader. 
  I collect (protection) taxes from traders, and this is the 
truth. And I also don't have to catch (the growers and traders). 
Who would I send them to? I just need the taxes to feed my 
soldiers. 
  Don't you think that your act alone is indirectly 
causing suffering? 
  That's up to what you think but I don't care. Americans 
trade drugs too, so do the British don't they? But I see no one 
making a big fuss over those people. I think some people made 
me a target to earn money. They know that I don't grow opium. 
  If there was anything that you could convey to the 
millions who are addicted to heroin and opium, what would it 
be? 
  First, I know that opium is not a good thing, it destroys 
one's health I quit growing opium in 1962, before anyone else. 
That year I initiated a tobacco plantation. I built 80 medical 
centres and 80 schools until the Burmese collaborated with the 
KMT (Kuomintang, the nationalist Chinese) and attacked us. Most 
medical units were destroyed but some schools still remain 
today. Local people can verify this. 
  If I met an addict, I would bring him in for rehabilitation. 
We have a rehabilitation centre here. I feel concern for four 
groups of people: the opium growers, the addicts, the traders 
and those who are jailed for narcotic related charges. I feel 
pity that drugs destroyed their families. 
  In 1977, the United States government sent Mr Josef Nellis 
to 
negotiate with me. I proposed to him a 6-year opium eradication 
scheme but the US refused. Since then, I don't know how many 
six year terms have repeated themselves but the amount of opium 
production in Shan and Burma were at 200 tonnes per year before 
British colonization. But since the inception of the DEA, the 
number has increased to over 4,000 tonnes. The money that the 
DEA put in became a good fertilizer for opium. What I would 
like to say is, "Don't make a big fuss over it." 
  If those who are after me say that Khun Sa is the undisputed 
Opium King, then why not come to get me? If you want to catch 
the main goon come and get the chief goon not those minute 
hooligans. But they don't so when can the crime be eradicated? 
  I made a proposition to the Thai government too. I wanted to 
tell them that it's not a big deal if we really want to 
eradicate opium but don't do it the DEA way. Or don't do it the 
UN's way because what they are doing now is like trimming a 
tree. They should come to me and uproot the tree. I really 
look forward to cooperating with all parties. If we have enough 
money to live and fight to attain independence we could 
eradicate all the opium fields in one day. The existing opium 
can be sold to any nation interested and it can be dumped 
wherever they wish.

  [Text] Khun Sa has mobilized his forces to encircle 
Burmese Government troops and is trying to recapture Chot Town. 
In the ensuing battle four Khun Sa soldiers were killed, at 
least 15 Burmese soldiers were believed killed, and there were 
many casualties. The latest report says that Khun Sa's men have 
succeeded in recapturing five bases. 
  Shan State, 11 May--Four days ago Burmese Government forces 
attacked a Khun Sa stronghold and captured seven military bases 
on Doi Hinpong, opposite Thailand's Wiang Haeng District, Chiang 
Mai province. On the day of the loss of the bases, the Khun Sa 
troops encircled the Burmese soldiers in the captured bases, 
triggering heavy fighting along the Thai-Burmese border opposite 
Thailand's Ban Piang Luang, Wiang Haeng District. 
  A report says the 250-strong Khun Sa force attacked the 
Burmese Government force in the bases on Doi Hinpong in Chot 
Town, about 20 km from the Thai border and recaptured five of 
the bases. 
  A report on the fighting by the Thai Task Force 327 in Wiang 
Haeng District said four Khun Sa soldiers were killed and many 
wounded. Some of the wounded were taken for treatment to a 
hospital in Ban Maisung, a Khun Sa liberated area. Some were 
sent to the district hospital in Wiang Haeng District. The 
casualties on the Burmese Government side were estimated at no 
less than 15 killed. 
  According to Prince Khunduan Saengkham, the secretary 
general 
of the Shan State restoration council, the Khun Sa soldiers have 
been deployed in Tuan and Chang Towns and have completely 
encircled Chot Town. An attack on the Burmese Government 
soldiers was expected soon. 
  The prince said: "We have hired about 20 small buses in Ban 
Piang Luang to transport soldiers to reinforce the front line 
and move the wounded soldiers to the district hospital in Wiang 
Haeng District."

  [Text] A dozen pharmacists and distributors of 
pharmaceutical products have been arrested for illegally selling 
large quantities of a potent painkiller causing strong 
hallucination to the public at huge profits. 
  The Seoul District Prosecutor's Office said yesterday that 
two medical doctors were also indicted without formal arrest on 
charges of violating the Pharmaceutical Law for helping 
distributors take the products out of hospital inventory. 
  According to state prosecutors, the 12 arrested allegedly 
engaged in the distribution of products containing nalbuphane 
HC1, hallucinating its users, from April last year through last 
month. 
  Initial investigations showed that the 12, mostly 
pharmaceutical company employees, distributed 22,000 ampules 
(one ampule contains 10 centiliters) of the injection drug which 
have a market value of 60-100 million won (750,000-1.2 million 
U.S. dollars). 
  The prosecutors said the drug, which is believed to bring 
reactions as powerful as methamphetamine, sells for about 
30,000-50,000 won per ampule, mostly to youths and drug addicts. 
  "The distributors worked clandestinely with doctors and 
pharmacists to gain access to large quantities of nalbuphane and 
sold them through organized networks run by hooligans," one 
prosecutor explained. 
  In one instance, the prosecutors said, Yi Sok-chae, a 
manager 
of a pharmaceutical company, purchased 11,800 ampules at 400-500 
won each and sold them to another distributor at 1,500-2,000 won. 
  "What is shocking about this case is that it involved 
organized groups of people who are well aware of the dangerous 
implications of administering the painkiller," one prosecutor 
said.

  [Text] Some 2,380 kilos of dry and raw marijuana seized in 
Vientiane Province were destroyed on 12 May by provincial 
narcotics control and suppression authorities in the presence of 
several officials from other services concerned in the province. 
The destroyed marijuana was discovered and seized by provincial 
economic police authorities in their search for marijuana 
plantations operated by certain opportunists in many localities 
in the province since mid-1993. The destroyed haul was valued at 
12.8 million kip [Lao currency]. Fifty-three marijuana planters, 
mostly residents of Kasi District, were reprimanded and fined by 
the local authorities concerned in accordance with the law.

recommend that party leader Banhan Sinlapa-acha ask the Nakhon 
Phanom MP to resign voluntarily from the House to protect the 
party's and Parliament's image. 
  Party sources said the move came after a U.S. federal grand 
jury indicted Mr Thanong on drug smuggling charges three years 
ago. The indictment was only revealed in the United States 
yesterday. 
  The sources said the Chat Thai committee headed by Sa Kaeo 
MP 
Burin Hiranburana would seek a meeting with Mr Banhan today 
where it would ask him to request Mr Thanong's resignation 
rather than expel him from the party. 
  "The committee believes Mr Thanong should resign to show 
political spirit by protecting the image of the party and 
Parliament," said one of the sources. 
  Mr Burin yesterday confirmed the proposal but said this 
would 
only be done if the evidence against Mr Thanong is credible. 
  He said the party's findings would be based on the available 
documentary evidence, press reports, wire agency reports and 
information from government agencies. 
  He said Mr Banhan would sign a letter asking the Prime 
Minister to order relevant government agencies to cooperate with 
the party by making available any information. The agencies 
include the Office of the Narcotics Control Board and Police 
Narcotics Suppression Bureau. 
  Mr Thanong is to testify before the party committee this 
morning at 10.00. The five-man committee will also seek 
meetings with drug suppression officials to obtain more 
information and evidence, said Mr Burin. 
  He said the House of Representatives Affairs Committee had 
already given the party panel permission to attend its meetings 
and to use its information. 
  "I think the Chat Thai panel will be able to complete its 
probe within the 15-day limit given by the party," he said. 
  The panel is expected to prepare a summarized report by May 
20 for submission to Mr Banhan 
  Panel member Man Patthanothai will look into the legal 
implications and problems connected with the case. 
  Mr Burin said the United States was only proceeding with 
civil action against Mr Thanong, but criminal action should also 
be taken if it has information linking him to marijuana 
smuggling. 
  "Senior party figures will decide what to do once we finish 
our probe, but one option is that Mr Thanong could review his 
position in an effort to save the image of the party and 
Parliament," he said. 
  Party sources said Mr Banhan wanted to act responsibly but 
has chosen not to launch an investigation by saying the matter 
occurred before Mr Thanong joined Chat Thai. 
  One source said Chat Thai would take real action against Mr 
Thanong and would not let things drag on or try to defend him 
because the allegation is causing severe damage to the party.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday denied that 
drug allegations against Chat Thai MP for Nakhon Phanom Thanong 
Siriprichaphong were an attempt by the Government to discredit 
the Opposition following a recent threat from the Opposition to 
censure the Government. 
  Mr Chuan dismissed reports that a large number of 
politicians 
were known to be involved in the narcotics trade but conceded 
that some of the drug suspects were politicians. 
  The Prime Minister said legal action would be taken against 
any individual suspected of being involved in narcotics 
trafficking regardless of who he or she is if enough evidence 
could be found to substantiate the charges. 
  However, he said the Government could not reveal any 
U.S.-supplied information on drug traffickers to the media in 
Thailand to avoid defamation charges. 
  PM's Office Minister Thoetphong Chaiyanan, who is also 
chairman of the Government Parties Coordination Committee, said 
the allegations against Mr Thanong must be thoroughly checked 
before the House of Representatives can make further moves on Mr 
Thanong's case.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday ruled out the 
extradition of Thanong Siriprichaphong to the United States, 
where he is wanted on drugs charges. 
  Chuan said the police or the Office of the Narcotics Control 
Board (ONCB) can take legal action against the Chat Thai MP in 
Thailand if they have sufficient evidence from the United States. 
  Chuan insisted that any action against Thanong, who has been 
accused by the U.S. of conspiring to smuggle more than 45 tones 
of marijuana into the United States, should be in a Thai court 
rather than overseas. 
  A U.S. indictment, revealed on Tuesday, charges Thanong with 
smuggling, conspiracy and operating a continuing criminal 
enterprise between 1973 and 1987. 
  The U.S. Justice Department announced early this week that 
it 
will seek Thanong's extradition under a treaty with Thailand. 
But Thai officials insisted the treaty did not oblige 
extradition of Thais to the U.S. and vice versa. 
  "If police or the Office of Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) 
have enough evidence, they can take legal action against 
Thanong," Chuan said. "They can request evidence from the U.S.." 
  Chuan said investigators must have sufficient evidence 
before 
taking criminal cases into court. 
  "The government's duty is to ensure justice prevails in our 
society. Any allegations against Thais should be tried in a 
Thai court," he said. 
  The government was also willing to comply with a Chat Thai 
request to provide a party fact-finding committee with all 
information relating to the charges against Thanong. 
  Other senior government MPs yesterday were also insisting 
that any action against Thanong should be in Thailand. 
  Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said: "We will 
never send Thai people to stand trial in a foreign country. We 
will take legal action against a culprit according to evidence 
we have and under Thai law." 
  He said the Foreign Ministry was in contact with the U.S. 
authorities and was seeking more details of the evidence against 
Thanong. 
  Aphisit believed Chat Thai's fact-finding committee would be 
neutral and take action against Thanong according to the 
evidence placed before it. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan, who oversees the ONCB, 
said the agency had a policy of cooperating fully with the U.S. 
in tracking down drug trafficking activities. It would not 
protect Thanong if there was evidence against him. 
  Amnuai would not commit himself on the issue of Thanong's 
extradition to the U.S. but said Thailand had a discretionary 
right to prosecute its own citizens. 
  Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said Thanong would be 
immediately prosecuted in Thailand if police had sufficient 
evidence. 
  "Police are waiting for more evidence from the U.S. 
  "If they get enough evidence to substantiate the charges 
against Thanong, the prosecution will proceed," he said. 
  Parliament President Marut Bunnak said that in practice 
Thailand would not allow the extradition of its citizens to 
stand trial in a foreign country. 
  The U.S. Embassy, meanwhile, has offered to help make 
possible a visit to the United States by Thanong. 
  The embassy also announced that it "is working closely with 
the (Thai) Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the issue, and is 
providing a complete text of the indictment to the ministry". 
  Thanong has denied the U.S. charges and announced his 
willingness to travel to the US, if necessary, to defend himself.

  [Excerpt] Thai law enforcers should start looking into the 
allegations of drug trafficking made against Chat Thai MP 
Thanong Siriprichapong, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said 
yesterday. 
  Information provided by US authorities linking Thanong to a 
conspiracy to smuggle 45 tones of marijuana into the United 
States from 1973-87 constituted grounds for an investigation, he 
said. 
  "With or without US urging, it is the duty of Thai law 
eforcement officials to take action. Police have a duty to 
investigate alleged wrongdoers--no matter who they are," the 
prime minister said. "In the case in question, there are 
adequate grounds for investigation." 
  House Speaker Marut Bunnak yesterday said a Chat Thai 
urgency 
motion asking the House of Representatives to consider taking 
action against Thanong had been put on the agenda. 
  The motion was item 14 on the agenda, but could be brought 
forward if MPs wished. 
  Submitted by Chamnong Phothisaro (Chat Thai-Sisaket), it 
asks 
the House of Representatives to decide what to do about the 
Nakhon Phanom MP, charging that the allegations against him have 
affected the credibility of the House. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Letter from Thanat Khoman, former foreign minister, in the </F>
"Post Bag" column] 
  [Text] SIR: Once again, the World Accuser swells his 
throat to shout accusations against Thailand when the US State 
Department alleged that cadres (narcotics) have allies in 
government offices, banks and law enforcement agencies which, 
according to that source, allowed illicit drug trade to flourish 
in Thailand. This statement reflects the accusers' own rich 
experience and practices. How? 1. The United States, or at 
least the CIA, under George Bush, used General Noriega, now 
imprisoned in Florida, as its salaried agent, to get involved in 
drug operations in Latin, and particularly South and Central 
America. When that agent became indocile, Bush sent armed 
forces to capture him and, in the process, committed a dastardly 
massacre of innumerable innocent Panamanian people. 
  2. As to drug money laundering, American officials and 
others 
know something about it. A certain Clark Clifford, who was once 
US Secretary of Defence and later became president of an 
important bank in New York, was arraigned before a law court 
there accused of involvement in drug money laundering through 
his bank collaborating with the famous BCCI. He was subjudice 
until the time when the Democrats, having won the elections, 
pulled him out of that predicament for ill-health reason. That 
was the way how justice operates in that wonderful land of super 
race and super virtuous men. 
  3. To me and, I am sure, to many Thais, the acceptance of 
the 
miserable US$2 million, for cooperation in drug matter, 
undeniably hurts our national pride. That loathsome money 
should be returned to the donors with our thanks, as they may 
need it for use elsewhere. And, the sooner the better. We will 
help raise funds to replace that insulting money, which has made 
it possible for that foreign government to send DEA (drug 
enforcement) agents here. One of them, not long ago, killed a 
suspect without due verification. The affair was hushed up, and 
the culprit was shipped out with collusion from our authorities. 
  4. I hope that, after the recent accusation, the Thai side 
will review the matter and take appropriate step in the right 
direction. We should be wise enough to realise that this is a 
way to "pass the buck" and the blame upon us, to be used as the 
scapegoats, while the principal party--namely the United States 
and a number of Western nations--are fuelling it by insatiable 
demands as their local consumption continually increases, 
causing greater difficulties for us to curb and suppress 
production. The United States and its Western cronies are, in 
fact, directly responsible. 
  5. The question which comes to the mind of many people is 
how a government, which cannot maintain law and order in its own 
country where crime rate in its own capital city rises by some 
50 per cent to the point that its mayoress had to ask for the 
intervention of the National Guard, has the indecency to preach 
lessons and make accusations against others? It would certainly 
earn more respect and credibility by observing the elementary 
honesty and recognise its own defects and concentrate on setting 
its own house in order.

<F P=106> [By Ophat Bunlom] </F>
  [Text] The Thai government should honor its extradition 
treaty with the United States and send Nakhon Phanom MP Thanong 
Siriprichaphong to stand trial in that country where he is 
accused of having smuggled in 45 tones of marijuana between 1973 
and 1987, according to a legal expert. 
  Phanat Thatsaniyanon, a member of the government's mutual 
legal assistance committee which handles the legal aspects of 
extraditions, said the Thai government should comply with a 
request by a U.S. court to have Thanong extradited to answer to 
drug smuggling charges although under the Thai-U.S. treaty, the 
Thai government can use its discretion. 
  "If the Thai government decides not to extradite Thanong to 
stand trial in the United States, it must be able to explain 
why. The Thai government cannot just cite `national pride' for 
not honoring the treaty," Phanat said. 
  "The international community has come a long way toward a 
borderless world, with increasing cooperation among countries, 
and Thailand should not hold back by stubbornly adhering to 
false national pride," he said. 
  Phanat said the U.S. government had complied with requests 
by 
Thailand for the extradition of Thai citizens, including the 
case of So Thanawisut, who fled to the United States after being 
charged with masterminding a murder in Thailand several years 
ago. 
  He said the U.S. government had consistently honored the 
extradition treaty because it attached great importance to 
bilateral cooperation in this area. 
  Phanat said in a Thai-U.S. extradition treaty ratified some 
60 years ago, Thailand had made it a point not to send its own 
citizens to stand trial in the United States under any 
circumstance because of national pride. The agreement has since 
been replaced by the Thai-U.S. extradition treaty of 1990, which 
allows the Thai government to use its discretion on a 
case-by-case basis. 
  Under normal procedures, the U.S. government will send an 
extradition request to the Thai Foreign Ministry which in turn 
will pass it on to the Police Department. The Police Department 
will ask the Office of the Attorney General to seek a court 
order for the extradition if it decides that the request should 
be complied with. 
  "The whole business depends on the Thai government. If the 
Thai government decides not to comply with the request, then 
there will be no extradition," Phanat said. 
  Retired Supreme Court judge Sansoen Kraichitti, also a 
member 
of the mutual legal assistance committee, said a person 
extradited under the treaty would be punished only after 
standing trial in the other country and being found guilty of 
the alleged crime. 
  Sansoen also said the Thai-U.S. extradition treaty did not 
make it compulsory for the Thai government to comply with all 
extradition requests made by the U.S. government. 
  He said those charged with drug trafficking and extradited 
under the treaty must have allegedly committed the crime after 
1991 because a provision in the Thai anti-drug law that allows 
alleged offenders to be tried in foreign courts was introduced 
in that year. 
  Chaikasem Nitisiri, deputy special prosecutor in charge of 
international legal assistance on criminal matters, said 
Thailand's Office of the Attorney General had not received a 
formal request from U.S. law enforcement officials regarding 
Thanong's extradition. 
  He ruled out the possibility of Thanong, a Chat Thai MP, 
being extradited to the United States while Parliament is in 
session. 
  "Even if we received an extradition request now, we would 
not 
be able to send Khun Thanong to the U.S. at this time, while 
Parliament is in session," Chaikasem said. 
  MPs have immunity from legal prosecution while Parliament is 
in session.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "MP's and Marijuana"] </F>
  [Text] No one should wonder about the spreading of the 
rumor on the confiscation of property in the United States of 
the MP who has been accused of exporting marijuana to that 
country. Neither is it correct to think that the whole issue is 
a scheme to discredit any political party. The very question 
that we should raise now is why the story has been kept under 
wraps for at least a year. The U.S. had attempted to get in 
touch with the accused MP through the Thai Government since 
January last year. Nothing was leaked to the general public. 
  In practice, the Thai Government, especially the agencies 
and 
ministers concerned, should expeditiously reciprocate the 
request for cooperation in the suppression of narcotics 
trafficking from any foreign government. However, this case had 
been covered up for some time probably because it involved 
politicians and influential connections. 
  Official confirmation from the U.S. embassy about the 
seizure 
of the MP's property in the U.S. has led many to believe that 
there could be many Thai MP's engaging in the illicit business. 
Research conducted six to seven years ago also revealed that as 
many as eight MP's were involved in the marijuana trade. Up to 
this point, one will find it rather difficult to turn a blind 
eye to the drug scandal. 
  Moreover, several reports following the outbreak of the 
scandal on international drug trafficking connnections reveal 
that government officials, politicians, and local businessmen 
have been involved in exporting marijuana to the U.S. The 
government's suppression operations have so far been aimed only 
at small planters and traffickers, while the real chieftains of 
the criminal syndicates are left undisturbed to continue with 
their lucrative trade until the shameful fact is exposed by a 
foreign country. 
  Therefore, it is imperative to call on the House of 
Representatives to make serious endeavors to quickly finalize 
the investigations into the marijuana trafficking charge against 
the MP. The House of Representatives must defend its reputation. 
This is not the personal affair of the accused MP because it 
can also have negative effects on the entire legislative 
institution. Not only the House of Representatives, the Senate 
should also try to do something as a contribution and by so 
doing, more people will come to realize its significance.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "`Sitting Duck' Becoming Troublesome for </F>
Government?"] 
  [Text] The leaders of the Chuan coalition should have been 
dancing with joy after a drug scandal blew up in the face of the 
opposition faction. An immediate effect was that they have been 
given a welcome respite from an opposition move to call for a 
no-confidence debate over the unimpressive performance of the 
administration. 
  As the mystery shrouding the past deeds of Chat Thai MP 
Thanong Siriprichaphong is being unraveled with more 
embarrassing evidence involving his alleged role in marijuana 
consignments to the U.S., Thai authorities appear reluctant to 
be put on the spot with the lawmaker. A nagging question from 
the public is "why so?" 
  Thanong, proprietor of the Little Duck Group of hotel and 
entertainment chains, has become an ugly duckling for Chat Thai 
Party and the whole opposition block which have been dismayed by 
a sudden reversal of fortune. Newly-elected Chat Thai leader 
Banhan Sinlapa-acha must have been particularly upset by the 
jinx which had further dimmed his chances of being in the 
government by whatever means he deems possible. 
  The scandal has made all senior officials in law enforcement 
and drug suppression look very foolish. First they said they 
had not been aware of Thanong's path to his current vast 
fortune. Yielding to more pressing questions, they conceded 
that they had quite substantial information about the MP's 
alleged role in drug trafficking. 
  The public is frustrated on many points after hearing hasty 
explanations from Thanong as well as government authorities. 
Thanong categorically denied on May 6 that he had no idea about 
the assets seized by U.S. authorities, but conceded on Tuesday 
that he had indeed owned the property and a limousine in 
California. The exposed falsehood was sufficient to wash away 
whatever innocence he had claimed. 
  Any prosecutor having Thanong on the defense stand and with 
that kind of admission would certainly be rubbing his hands in 
glee. But wait a minute. What we heard later from government 
officials was perplexing. From all comments, it boiled down to 
something like this: they weren't quite sure whether legal 
actions could be taken against the lawmaker who is being accused 
by U.S. authorities of trafficking in narcotics. 
  "There is not yet any evidence to implicate him," they said. 
This is really funny. They made the statement even before there 
was any attempt to start an investigation. The Police 
Department is silent. The Interior Ministry officials are 
distancing themselves from the "sitting duck" who is now in the 
line of fire of U.S. legal potshots. 
  The Narcotics Suppression Unit has not displayed any 
enthusiasm to launch a probe, despite a forced admission that 
there was substantial record of suspected illegal activities. 
The Office of the Attorney General did not seem interested in 
finding out whether there are grounds for legal actions. 
  We wonder why, because the whole mess is making a mockery of 
our creaking legal machinery. 
  But more revealing yesterday was an explanation from 
American 
authorities that there had been a plan to arrest the MP if he 
showed up in the United States. This should be dreadful enough 
for Thanong to change his bravado that he intended to prove his 
innocence in any U.S. court of law. He will be lucky enough, 
from now on, to stay away from the long arm of the American law 
whenever he travels outside Thailand. 
  There are too many fine points involved. But there are 
things to be done. Thanong must discontinue his House 
membership to reduce the negative image on the institution. The 
government must start investigations right away on this 
explosive scandal. If not, it must explain to the public why 
the MP should be exempted from due process of the law to clear 
his name. 
  If the government is unmoved, it would not be a surprise to 
see Chat Thai and other opposition MPs from Chat Phathana and 
Social Action parties come up soon with an audacious demand that 
Prime Minister Chuan resign to show his responsibility, if 
Thanong refuses to quit. 
  Knowing full well the extent of their political scruples, we 
believe that they certainly can go that far.

<F P=106> [From the "Thai Talk" column by Suthichai Yun: "Trafficking </F>
in Drugs and Uttering Lies"] 
  [Text] The Chuan administration has produced another 
"first" in the country's political annals: This government has 
turned an international drug trafficking case into a partisan 
incident. 
  For some bizarre reason, the prime minister, who, under 
normal circumstances, would be considered the nation's top 
law-enforcement official, has decided to adopt a "hands-off" 
policy in the scandal involving 45 tonnes of Thai marijuana 
shipped from either Thailand or nearby countries to the United 
States between 1973 and 1987 allegedly involving an opposition 
lawmaker from Nakhon Panom province. 
  Strange, incredible and incoherent statements were made by 
all concerned from the very first day this story broke into the 
open here about two weeks ago. Nobody should have been taken 
aback of course when MP Thanong Siriprichaphong denied it all. 
That he backtracked somewhat to admit some of the claims made 
by the U.S. Information Service was only to be expected. 
  It should have come as no surprise, either, that some of the 
leading members of Chat Thai Party came out vehemently to raise 
the specter of a concerted conspiracy to discredit the major 
opposition party. And the allegation may well be valid to a 
certain extent. If the timing of the "leak" was suspect, the 
drug-trafficking episode was a clear case of violation of the 
law--American and Thai. 
  But the government has mishandled the scandal from the 
outset. The USIS statement made it very clear that the first 
official word of the indictment against this group of Thais was 
relayed to the Thai government in January, 1993. Fifteen months 
later, Government House, the Foreign Ministry and the Office of 
Narcotics Control Board said they had no clues about the case at 
all. Suddenly, the government itself was trapped by its attempt 
to detach itself from a potentially sensitive issue. Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai's initial reaction to reporters' 
questions was one of typical caution and detachment. It was him 
all over again, warning against rushing to conclusions and 
allowing the accused to state his case. 
  Likewise, Thai police were tonguetied. The Foreign Ministry, 
presumably the only official channel through which the U.S. 
Embassy had informed the Thai government about the indictment, 
failed miserably to explain why it had kept quiet for so long. 
The country's top drug enforcement agency under the 
jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Office, was caught 
offguard, mumbling something bordering on disbelief. Its 
earlier claims about close contacts with Washington's DEA in 
cracking down on drug traffickers suddenly faded into oblivion. 
  While Thanong put on his flip-flop show, his Chat Thai Party 
went through its defensive motion. Banhan Sinlapa-acha, the new 
party boss, has every reason to believe that the whole exercise 
was part of a well-orchestrated conspiracy against his political 
career path. The leak came on the eve of his being elevated to 
the post as party leader--one year and four months after the 
Thai Foreign Ministry was supposed to have been tipped about the 
court case in San Francisco. 
  That was probably why Premier Chuan quickly turned the case 
into Chat Thai's very own in-house hot potato instead of 
demanding a full-fledged investigation into DEA's claim, whether 
or not the key suspect was a prominent politician in the 
opposition camp. One wonders whether the government would have 
treated this case with the same nonchalance had the same charge 
been slapped on a lawmaker on the side of the government. 
  The House of Representatives may have named a committee to 
look into the charges. The Chat Thai Party, too, has set up its 
own probe team, ostensibly to demonstrate its seriousness in 
salvaging its reputation. 
  But the government has yet to come up with any convincing 
move to underscore the fact that drug trafficking allegations 
are far from a partisan issue best left to political parties 
concerned. It's a national problem which affects the overall 
social and economic fabric--and the government's political 
credibility in living up to its platform to crack down hard on 
drugs and illicit drugs. 
  Prime Minister Chuan will have to get his people to answer 
some of the obvious questions which have been raised in this 
connection: 
  1. The DEA said it had submitted a official letter on 
Thanong's case in January, 1993. Who in which government agency 
was the recipient of the document? Why has the report been kept 
under wraps all along? Why weren't the prime minister, the 
foreign minister, the interior minister and the anti-narcotics 
agency informed about the request? 
  2. If the relevant agencies were in fact informed about the 
case, why did they insist, on the day the story broke, that they 
were not aware of the incident? If they, in fact, had been told 
about the story but were not ready to give out the truth to the 
public, were they therefore lying to the people? Who were they 
trying to protect? What has happened to accountability of 
public servants in this country? 
  3. Do the law-enforcement agencies plan to take their own 
action, under Thai laws, against those accused by the American 
authorities? Are we, members of the Thai public, being told to 
believe that the various shipments of marijuana destined for the 
United States were in no way related to Thailand--and that they 
did not constitute offenses under the Thai laws at all? 
  4. Does the five-party coalition government stand ready to 
be accused of politicizing the scandal to save itself from a 
no-confidence motion--and, in the process, undermining Chat Thai 
leader Banhan's attempts to grill the government? 
  In other words, can the government get away with its 
apparent 
inefficiency and obvious lack of accountability while the 
opposition tries to can this kettle of fish? The answer, plain 
and simple, is no.

  [Text] The Chat Thai Party has done the right thing in 
appointing a committee to investigate the U.S. drug trafficking 
charge against one of its MP's, Thanong Siriprichaphong. 
Thanong is accused of having been involved in exporting huge 
quantities of marijuana into the United States. The US 
Information Service [USIS], the U.S. Government's mouthpiece in 
Thailand, has confirmed the seizure of the MP's property in the 
United States. 
  Likewise, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri 
has also done the right thing when he assured the U.S. 
ambassador to Thailand that the Thai Government, dutybound to 
defend Thailand's integrity and interest, will fully cooperate 
with the United States in handling the case under the country's 
legal system. 
  Earlier, several opposition leaders pointed out that the 
controversy is a political ploy to discredit the opposition Chat 
Thai Party, while many others noted that the drug charge was a 
personal affair with no effect on the House of Representatives 
or Thailand. This opinion is correct only to a certain extent. 
  Since the accused is a member of the honorable House of 
Representatives and a public figure, his action does have 
repercussions on the institution he belongs to and on the 
country as a whole. This is a criminal case brought to court by 
a foreign government and the accused's property has already been 
confiscated. There is no way to keep the matter quiet. 
  We have learned from the new USIS release that the U.S. 
Embassy notified the Thai Government about the charge on 12 
January 1993. It has been more than a year now and all senior 
figures in the government and officials concerned earlier said 
that they knew nothing about the matter. 
  The accused MP himself told media representatives that he 
had 
not received any formal charge from the United States. Hence, 
people wonder about the efficiency of Thai law enforcement. How 
can the agencies in charge of narcotics suppression with their 
close touch with the United States be unaware of the incident? 
  We appeal to all parties concerned, be it the government, 
House of Representative, or Chat Thai Party, to expedite the 
investigation into the charge and publicize the clear facts to 
preserve the prestige of the Thai House of Representatives and 
the good reputation of the country. Do not create a negative 
image for the country's legal system, law enforcement, and 
judicial procedure in the eyes of foreigners.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Must Clear Up Slip-up on Burma'] </F>
  [Text] The call by a senior American policy-maker for 
increased U.S. ties with Burma needs to be quickly dismissed 
before it is mistaken for an actual Washington plan. State 
Department Counselor Tim Wirth's proposal to reverse U.S. action 
and widen contacts with Rangoon is badly misguided. His senior 
rank among U.S. officials lends unwarranted emphasis to his call 
for a new American policy on Burma. U.S. direction on Asian 
relations has recently come under internal fire from major 
Clinton administration officials. Mr Wirth's sudden and 
confusing recommendation for reversal of a stable Burma policy 
needs to be quickly clarified. 
  Mr Wirth is a former U.S. senator, with acknowledged 
expertise on narcotics matters. In an interview with the REUTER 
news agency last week, he recommended "more dialogue" between 
Washington and the Rangoon junta. Without providing details, Mr 
Wirth said such contact would reduce a huge outflow of heroin to 
the United States and other countries. He recommended ignoring 
the continuing and massive repression of Burmese in favor of his 
emphasis on the drugs problem. "I'm thinking of young people on 
the streets of the United States of America who are directly 
impacted by that," he told his interviewer. "That should be our 
priority." 
  Not even our own government's policy of "constructive 
engagement" is as cynical as Mr Wirth's proposal. The U.S. 
official's proposal would completely overlook the massive and 
violent abuses of Burmese citizens; At least the Thai--and 
ASEAN--approaches to Rangoon aim at reversing repression by the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). Mr Wirth, as a 
former politician, may feel he still must serve an exclusively 
American population. The only satisfaction we can draw is from 
a fellow official in the State Department who said Mr Wirth's 
proposal was "unlikely to be met with much enthusiasm." 
  Available evidence shows SLORC has neither the desire nor 
the 
ability to launch an effective anti-narcotics program. SLORC 
leader Lt Gen Khin Nyunt claimed last January his regime would 
move against narcotics peddling. The reality has been the 
opposite. An alleged military attack on warlord Khun Sa 
evaporated two months ago without a single gain. Opium growing 
and heroin refining continues to grow in northern Burma. SLORC 
has shown no commitment to combat such growth. In addition, 
troubling reports of direct links between narcotics dealers and 
SLORC officials continue unabated. 
  The proposal to put Rangoon and Washington on an equal 
diplomatic footing is misguided. Since it took power in 1988 
over the bodies of thousands of dead citizens, SLORC has shown 
few signs of compassion. For five years, it has kept its 
best-known and most peaceful citizen imprisoned at home. Aung 
San Suu Kyi said in a recent interview she remains determined to 
continue her struggle for a democratic Burma. The world's only 
superpower should do no less. 
  There may be no absolutes in diplomatic affairs. But the 
lack of goodwill from SLORC is clear. Mr Wirth's proposal to 
give status to the Rangoon junta in the mere hope it might 
respond is misguided. SLORC has had many years and opportunities 
to improve its image through direct action. Instead, it has 
continued one of the most repressive systems of governments of 
our day. There are several opinions and policies about how to 
change this. Mr Wirth's proposal merely to overlook them and to 
have faith that heroin exports will decline is a major act of 
faith. Beside this, the Thai government's hope that a slow 
increase in economic and diplomatic relations will encourage an 
easing of SLORC's tyranny seems like a paragon. 
  The chief U.S. policy-maker for Asian affairs, Winston Lord, 
complained last week that U.S.-Asian relations have been sliding 
for the past six months. The confusing statement from Mr Wirth 
tends to back up this claim. United States policy towards Burma 
has been clear, and firm, since 1988. Indeed, Mr Lord himself 
said a week ago that Washington intended to continue to disagree 
with ASEAN on the matter. "The United States wants Burma 
isolated while ASEAN is pursuing a policy of engagement," he 
said. If Washington is going to change this policy, it owes its 
allies a clear warning. If, as it should, the U.S. intends to 
continue to press SLORC for change, it must make this clear. Mr 
Wirth's statement has caused confusion. The Clinton 
administration should clear it up quickly.

  [Text] Chiang Mai -- The Third Army has reinforced the 
northern border with Burma's Shan State to ensure fighting 
between the Burmese army and the Mong Tai Army of opium warlord 
Khun Sa does not spill over into Thailand. 
  Border security sources said local border patrol police, the 
military's special 327 unit and paramilitary troops have been 
put on alert. 
  The sources said the fighting was about 40 km from the 
border 
and so far was not intense. 
  Thais living in the frontier area had not been affected. 
  The wounded from both sides were being sent to Thailand for 
medical treatment, but were being sent back once they recovered, 
according to the source. 
  Khun Sa's army and the government forces have been fighting 
over mountainous areas near Mong Chot in southern Shan State 
since Wednesday. 
  Mong Chot is a strategic Burmese border town about 30 km 
from 
the Thai village of Ban Piang Luang, in the Wiang Haeng district 
of Chiang Mai. 
  Khun Sa's spokesman, Khunsai Jaiyene, said the MTA had 
captured 13 Burmese outposts on three hills surrounding Mong 
Chot, and was advancing toward the town. 
  He hoped the guerrillas would seize the Burmese stronghold 
at 
Doi Pok Hom within the next two days. He said they had already 
surrounded the area. 
  About 500 troops of the MTA 52nd Battalion, led by Maj Saeng 
Som, were used in the attack against about 700 Burmese 
defenders, he added. 
  He said the Burmese had lost 25 men, while the MTA suffered 
18 dead and 45 wounded. 
  Khun Sa's forces had also taken five soldiers and two 
porters 
captive. 
  The border sources said the ethnic Wa had recently sent 
about 
500 troops to assist the Burmese 519th Battalion, which is 
stationed near Mong Chot. 
  The MTA has also sent reinforcements. 
  The sources predicted the fighting would soon intensify.

`Lucrative'   Drug Trade

  [Text] The Government is considering drafting an 
anti-money laundering law as part of stepped-up measures against 
the lucrative drug trade. 
  The disclosure, made by an anti-narcotics agency chief 
yesterday, follows the United States accusation last week that 
prominent Thai businessman and Opposition Chat Thai MP Thanong 
Siriprichapong is involved in exporting marijuana to the US. 
  Pol Gen [Police General] Chawalit Yotmani, secretary-general 
of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board [ONCB], said his 
agency was in the process of coordinating with government 
organizations to draw up the law. 
  The legislation would empower government officials to check 
into the financial records of individuals suspected of 
involvement in the narcotics trade and to confiscate any money 
found to have been derived from drug sales. 
  The ONCB earlier successfully pushed for the law empowering 
the Government to confiscate the assets of people convicted of 
narcotics offenses. 
  "The planned legislation is expected to help effectively 
deal 
with the lucrative narcotics business," said Pol Gen Chawalit. 
  The ONCB chief said he believed government agencies 
responsible for financial matters such as the Finance Ministry 
had the capability and methods to trace the financial records of 
suspected drug traders. 
  Pol Gen Chawalit, emphasizing the urgency of the 
legislation, 
said he had discussed the matter with government leaders and 
many had supported its early implementation. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan, while confirming 
the proposed law was in the making, said the Government would 
have to be careful in enacting such legislation as it could 
contradict the principle of basic human rights. 
  The Government will have to study past problems in solving 
the narcotics problem before deciding what measures should be 
incorporated to enhance efficiency. 
  Finance Deputy Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri said he fully 
supported Pol Gen Chawalit's proposal as the measure would 
enable officials to fight the narcotics trade more effectively. 
  "We must help eradicate dirty money from the drug business," 
said the outspoken politician. 
  He said the proposed legislation, if implemented carefully, 
would not violate individuals' rights. 
  The checking of financial records could be limited to people 
on official blacklists only or to those suspected of involvement 
in the narcotics trade about whom the ONCB lacks evidence to 
press charges. 
  The Finance Ministry is ready to support the ONCB's 
proposal, 
he said. 
  Pol Gen Chawalit, when asked to comment on Mr Thanong's case 
yesterday, refused to offer any statement. 
  He said on Mr Thanong's claim that he had not been contacted 
by the US Drug Enforcement Agency concerning the accusation that 
the MP could say anything he wanted. 
  "I personally have no comment on that," he said. 
  There have been reports more politicians have been 
blacklisted for narcotics involvement, but Pol Gen Chawalit said 
only: 
  "I cannot make any comment even if I know anything about it. 
We just don't have enough evidence." 
  Mr Thanong is due to appear before the House Parliamentary 
Affairs Committee to answer the US allegations. 
  Committee member Pricha Suwannathat said the panel would ask 
the US Embassy in Bangkok to supply all documents related to the 
allegation. 
  House Speaker Marut Bunnak yesterday dismissed as groundless 
an unpublished paper alleging that there were eight other MPs 
from the Northeast involved in drug trafficking. 
  "I can not give this thesis any credence," said Mr Marut. 
  The media has publicized a so-called "secret" Chulalongkon 
University paper by Chumphon Phongsuwan which states there are 
eight other MPs involved in the drug trade. The paper, entitled 
"Marijuana Politics: a Power Structure Case Study of Local 
Politics" earned the special agent with the Office of Narcotics 
Control Board the best thesis award of 1987. 
  "There are both good and bad people in every organization 
including the House. But no rumor should sling groundless mud 
to dirty the House," said Mr Marut. 
  He said the paper did not specify when the MPs allegedly 
involved in the drug trade sat in Parliament and the lack of 
detail led him to disbelieve the allegation. 
  He also praised the Chat Thai Party for setting up a 
five-man 
committee to investigate the allegations against Mr Thanong. 
  "I believe the Chat Thai probe committee will be thorough in 
their investigation. The members are all competent statesmen 
and lawyers." 
  Chat Phatthana Party secretary-general Prachuap Chaiyasan 
said about the paper: 
  "We have to be openminded. The thesis did not mention any 
name in particular. The official has to investigate and show 
proof so that our country can clear this drug trafficking image." 
  Mr Prachuap said he did not believe the Chat Thai Party 
would 
protect Mr Thanong. Any member which brings notoriety to the 
party should act responsibly. 
  He said the House has the burden of proving the allegation 
and must make the information public. 
  "Every MP should be aware of the importance of his own 
reputation and history, and that is why Mr Thanong's case should 
be investigated," he said.

  [Text] Government leaders yesterday said they agreed to a 
proposal by anti-narcotics officials to introduce money 
laundering law provided it did not constitute an infringement on 
the freedom of the individual. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he approved of the idea in 
principle because a money laundering law would prevent dishonest 
people from converting their ill-gotten wealth into legal 
currency. 
  "In principle, the idea of preventing money laundering 
should 
do no harm to society. But we have to look into details of the 
proposed law to see whether the freedom of the individual would 
be compromised in the process," Chuan said. 
  The prime minister said the Office of the Narcotics Control 
Board (ONCB) had yet to submit its proposed anti-money 
laundering legislation to the Cabinet. 
  On Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said he 
approved of the proposed law in view of complaints by anti-drug 
officials that, without such a law, drug traffickers would 
continue to flourish from their illegal trade. 
  ONCB officials say many major traders in illicit drugs are 
beyond the reach of the law because law enforcement officials 
normally do not have hard evidence to link them to the crime. 
They say a money laundering law would make it much more 
difficult for drug traffickers to convert drug proceeds into 
legal assets. 
  The government's support for the idea came after it was 
alleged that at least eight MPs were involved in the trade of 
marijuana. 
  Nakhon Phanom MP Thanong Siriprichaphong has been accused by 
the United States' Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) of 
involvement in the shipment of 45 tonnes of marijuana to the 
United States between 1977-87. His assets in the United 
States--a house and a luxury car--have been seized under an 
order by a district court in California although US law 
enforcement officials have yet to formally charge him with any 
crime. 
  Chuan, asked to comment on reports about a thesis written by 
an ONCB investigator which says eight MPs were involved in the 
marijuana trade, said he had seen the document, which lists 
certain lawmakers among other suspected drug traffickers. 
  But the prime minister added that there was "no hard and 
fast 
evidence. Some of them closely linked to local influential 
people or those who are suspected of involvement in drug 
trafficking." 
  He said he was told by ONCB officials that they could not 
find enough evidence to initiate legal action against most 
people on the list of suspected drug traffickers. 
  Chuan said he had instructed ONCB officials to take action 
without fear against anyone involved in the illegal drug trade 
as long as there was sufficient evidence. 
  Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said he agreed that 
Thailand should have a money laundering law which would help 
anti-drug officials fight drug dealers more effectively.

  [Text] Law enforcement agencies and financial supervisory 
authorities unanimously support money laundering legislation now 
being drafted by a government committee, Deputy Prime Minister 
Amnuai Wirawan said yesterday. 
  Amnuai said he had ordered the government panel in charge of 
drawing up new laws, in cooperation with Chulalongkon 
University's Faculty of Law, to study money laundering laws 
already in use in other countries. 
  "We have discussed the matter and all government agencies 
have given their full support," Amnuai said. "I have also 
raised the issue with the Bank of Thailand. There should be no 
problem (in introducing the law)." 
  Amnuai, who oversees the Office of the Narcotics Control 
Board (ONCB), said he was advised by the anti-drug agency that 
such a law would make it difficult for drug traffickers to 
convert their proceeds into legal currencies and assets. 
  "The measures against money laundering are a good thing. And 
it would not hurt law-abiding citizens either," Amnuai said. "No 
private individual's rights will be compromised." 
  He sought to allay fears expressed by some members of the 
banking community and politicians that a money laundering law 
would turn away foreign investors and shoot down Thailand's 
aspiration to become a financial hub in Southeast Asia. 
  "I don't think a money laundering law, if introduced, would 
affect local or foreign investors. And there is no question 
about whether commercial banks would cooperate with the 
government on the matter. All we need is appropriate guidelines 
and procedures. 
  Amnuai said a money laundering law would require banks to 
report to law enforcement agencies "unusual transactions", 
particularly large cash deposits, by their clients." (The 
anti-money laundering measures) will seek to control and monitor 
cash transactions. No restrictions will be imposed on the 
issuance of personal cheques which can already be monitored." 
  Senate Speaker Michai Ruchuphan, a legal expert, said a 
money 
laundering law was like a "two-edged sword" because although it 
would be useful as an instrument against drug traffickers and 
other organized crime, it would have a wide-ranging effect on 
all members of the public. 
  "The money laundering law would affect everyone of us. The 
law would require everybody--no matter who he is or what he 
does--to identify the source of his money," Michai said. 
  He said the government should carefully consider the 
advantages and drawbacks of such legislation before deciding 
whether to enact it. Among possible drawbacks is abuse of 
authority by government officials who have access to people's 
financial records. 
  Earlier this week, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he 
approved of the proposal by anti-drug officials to introduce a 
money laundering law provided that it did not infringe upon the 
freedom of the individual. 
  Also yesterday, John Gieve, president of the Group of 
Seven's 
Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) said 
senior Thai government officials he met during a two-day visit 
Thursday and yesterday had expressed support for the proposed 
introduction of a law to combat money laundering. 
  Gieve, also under-secretary of the United Kingdom's 
Treasury, 
met Bank of Thailand Governor Wichit Suphinit on Thursday and 
Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin yesterday, among other 
senior Thai officials. 
  The FATF was established by the Group of Seven Economic 
Summit in 1989 to develop a multilateral response to the threat 
posed by the growth of international money laundering, 
particularly the laundering of drug trafficking proceeds. The 
body now has 26 member countries. 
  FATF member countries in Asia-Pacific include Japan, 
Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia. 
  Dilwyn Griffiths, secretary to the FATF, said although money 
laundering was never an issue in Thailand because the country 
has not made it a criminal offense, there must be some 
laundering activities given the fact that Thailand is a major 
transshipment point for heroin from the Golden Triangle to the 
world market.

<F P=106> [Article by Philip Sherwell in Bangkok: "Thai Drugs Trial </F>
Told of &pound;1,000 for `Mule'"] 
  [Text] Sandra Gregory stood in the witness box in her 
Bangkok drugs case for the first time yesterday and blamed her 
co-accused, Robert Lock. 
  Choking back tears, Gregory told the court her fellow Briton 
had promised to pay her &pound;1,000 to act as a "mule" by 
smuggling 87 grams of heroin to Japan for him. 
  She said he had bought the drugs which she was caught with 
at 
the city's airport last year. 
  Sitting in leg-irons and a faded prison tunic, Lock, 30, who 
has denied all charges, watched the proceedings impassively. 
  He was carrying no drugs when he was arrested with Gregory 
after they checked in with his girlfriend, Ruth Billingham, for 
a flight to Tokyo. Lock insists he was simply going on holiday 
to Japan with Billingham and met Gregory at the airport. 
  But the court has previously heard that undercover narcotics 
agents at the British Embassy had tipped off Thai customs to 
watch out for Lock, whom they suspected of drug smuggling. 
  Gregory, 28, of Sowerby Bridge, West Yorks, who faces a 
minimum 25 years in jail after pleading guilty, was found with 
the drugs hidden in her body in four condoms. 
  After giving evidence for two hours she said from her cell: 
"I couldn't believe I was talking about myself. I can't believe 
I am in this position. 
  "I did it because I needed the money to get back home. It 
sounded too good to be true and there was supposed to be no 
chance of getting caught." 
  In her evidence she told her lawyer that Lock, who ran a 
jewellery business in Bangkok, came to her guesthouse a few 
hours before the flight last February and gave her the drugs. 
They had met previously to discuss the trip. 
  Gregory, who had been teaching English in Bangkok for two 
years, told the court she was suffering from fever and wanted 
the money for a ticket home. 
  Under cross-examination from Lock's lawyer, Khun Puttri, 
Gregory said she had only previously seen heroin in newspaper 
pictures. 
  The lawyer focused on apparent discrepancies between her 
initial written statement and her testimony yesterday, most 
notably on how much money she claimed Lock was to pay her. 
  The case, which has already lasted a year, was adjourned 
until May 16.

  [Text] Police Colonel Thatnarong Winyanrat, commander of 
the Border Patrol Police Unit No. 34 in Tak Province, said 
during an interview that he agreed with the Office of Narcotics 
Control Board's [ONCB] report labelling Tak, Phitsanulok, and 
Chiang Mai Provinces as the major marijuana-producing areas in 
northern Thailand. He pointed out that over 75 percent of the 
area in Tak is mountains and dense jungles suitable for 
marijuana cultivation by hill tribes such as at Pang Sangkasi, 
Vang Tamlung, and Phaphun villages in Na Bot District and Na 
Khiri village in Muang Tak District. 
  Police Colonel Thatnarong added that capitalists from the 
northeastern region and upper part of the northern region will 
normally give marijuana seeds to tribesmen to begin cultivation 
at the beginning of the rainy season and provide the necessary 
instructions to ensure a bumper harvest. Marijuana is 
compressed into bars and sent by trucks to Chiang Rai Province 
from where the drug will be shipped down the Mekong River to the 
Gulf of Thailand for export to foreign countries and sale in 
domestic markets. 
  The officer said: "Our unit has been coordinating with the 
northern branch of the Office of Narcotics Control Board in 
search of marijuana plantations in the northern provinces. We 
destroyed not less than 15 tons of the grass worth millions of 
baht during each crackdown operation. However, the authorities 
also faced numerous difficulties because all the plantations are 
located in remote and mountainous areas which enables the 
culprits to flee before their arrival." 
  Meanwhile, Suphong Manatphaibun, deputy governor of Nakhon 
Phanom Province, disclosed that the provincial administration 
does not have sufficient information to confirm the ONCB 
office's claim that Nakhon Phanom is the largest 
marijuana-producing area in the country. However, he admitted 
that there are some marijuana plantations in the province. 
Several portions of the drug found in the province were 
smuggled into the country and authorities have been instructed 
to launch regular search and suppression operations. 
  Sub-lieutenant Prawat Athipanya, deputy governor of Sakon 
Nakhon Province, expressed his disagreement with the report by 
the ONCB Office saying Sakon Nakhon is one of the three largest 
marijuana-producing provinces in Thailand, noting that small 
plantations are scattered in the mountainous areas of Kut Bak 
District and Phuphan reserve forest. Unlike other provinces, 
Sakon Nakhon does not have any big investors engaging in 
marijuana cultivation. The provincial administration has 
ordered that continuous suppression operations be carried out 
throughout the province. 
  Sub-lieutenant Praswant said: "Most of the grass is grown in 
Tha Uthen District of Nakhon Phanom Province and in Laos, where 
Lao farmers plant marijuana along the bank of the Mekong River. 
We can clearly see the plants from the Thai side." He 
disclosed that Sakon Nakhon is no longer a marijuana transit 
point due to intensified suppression operations by provincial 
officials. 
  Banphot Piamdi, director of the Narcotics Control Center in 
the northern region, revealed that opium cultivation remains the 
big problem in the 17 northern provinces. The total acreage 
used for opium cultivation in 1993 was as high as 16,000 rai 
[2.5 rai is equivalent to one 1 acre]. Marijuana cultivation 
was first introduced to Sukhothai, Phitsanulok, Mae Hong Son, 
Chiang Mai, and Chiang Rai Provinces in 1987 and later spread to 
other nearby provinces. Tribesmen have found it easier and less 
complicated to grow marijuana than opium. Moreover, they can 
earn more from planting marijuana. More tribes people have now 
shifted to planting marijuana, but most of them plant the crop 
for their own consumption and sale in small quantities. 
Marijuana is not as big a business here as it is in the 
northeast. 
  Witthaya Kaeopharadai, Phalang Tham MP from Nakhon Si 
Thammarat Province, said people should not think that the U.S. 
drug charge against MP Thanong Siriprichaphong is politically 
motivated, adding that Thanong has acted correctly in appointing 
lawyers to deal with and clear himself from the U.S. accusation. 
  Asked about the thesis by an ONCB official on police 
involvement in drug trafficking connections, Police General 
Prathin Santipraphop, director general of the Police Department, 
replied that the topic is not unusual. In the past, several 
police officers and officials of other government agencies have 
been arrested on drug charges.

<F P=106> [By Suphaphon Kanwirayothin] </F>
  [Text] Hanoi -- Vietnam is preparing a draft law on 
narcotics which it hopes can be passed by Parliament next year 
with a view to coping with the rise in drug abuse and 
international drug trafficking, according to a senior official. 
  In the meantime, the Government is stepping up efforts to 
deal with the unprecedented surge in drug abuse in major cities 
as well as the cross-border opium trade with Laos and China. 
  Minister Hoang Duc Nghi, who chairs the National Committee 
for Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas recently visited 
Thailand, Burma and Indonesia to discuss "measures of 
cooperation" with neighboring countries to fight illicit drugs. 
  Vietnam has no laws on narcotics to date. Drug abuse is 
currently classified as a form of "social ill" and users are 
"rehabilitated" rather than punished. Only drug trafficking is 
considered a "crime". 
  There is widespread drug abuse in major cities such as Hanoi 
and Ho Chi Minh City, and authorities are worried that Vietnam 
has become a favored transit point for drug shipments to the 
United States and western Europe. 
  "International drug traffickers abuse the loose controls in 
Vietnam. We were informed by Interpol that money laundering has 
taken place in Vietnam, and we have in fact discovered some 
cases," said Deputy Minister Xuan of the National Committee for 
Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas. 
  While opium growing and addiction are prevalent among ethnic 
minorities in northern border provinces, police have detected 
larger quantities of heroin in circulation. Cocaine has also 
already appeared in Vietnam. 
  Deputy Minister Xuan said authorities in one case arrested a 
cocaine trafficker in Ho Chi Minh City, and in another 
intercepted the drug which originated from Latin America as it 
arrived at Qui Nhon port in Binh Dinh province. 
  Police reports from Germany, Russia and Canada indicate some 
narcotics that showed up in their countries transmitted in 
Vietnam, he said. [sentence as published] 
  As requested by Interpol, Vietnam has recently helped 
extradite an ethnic Vietnamese with American nationality wanted 
by US authorities on drug trafficking charges. He was hiding 
and suspected of laundering money in Vietnam. "In 1993 we also 
extradited many others through cooperation with Interpol." 
  Vietnam has sentenced one foreigner to death, the first such 
sentence last year, and so far capital punishment has been 
handed down on three drug traffickers. 
  Closer to home, Vietnam has seen more frequent and larger 
amounts of opium moving through the country from Laos. The 
drugs either remain in Vietnam or are being directed to China. 
  Deputy Minister Xuan said Vietnam only recently became aware 
of the "serious extent of the problem" when Hanoi tightened 
police and customs checks at three official crossings with 
Laos--in Tay Trang in Lai Chau province opposite Phong Saly, 
Song Ma in Son La province across from Houa Phan and Ky Son in 
Nghe An province opposite Xieng Khouang. 
  "It's very difficult to monitor what's going on in countless 
other unofficial border crossings," he said. 
  Vietnamese authorities suspect some drugs from the Golden 
Triangle, seeking to avoid tight controls in China at that part 
of the border, have eventually gone to China anyway through 
Vietnam. 
  He said the route spans from Laos into Lai Chau province, 
then to Hanoi and on to Lang Son which borders China's Yunnan 
province. 
  In Vietnam itself, Mr Xuan said there were currently 3,770 
hectares of opium growing area, as against 12,878 hectares in 
1992-1993 due to government suppression and "tactics of 
persuasion" among ethnic minorities, especially the Hmong, to 
plant cash crops. 
  The anti-drug draft law in the making will unify all matters 
related to illicit drugs including those absent or scattered in 
different orders, decrees, criminal codes. 
  Experts from the United Nations Drug Control Program are due 
in Hanoi soon to help the Vietnamese draft a master plan to 
combat narcotics abuse and trafficking, the subject of a 
national program, according to Mr Xuan. 
  Vietnam is also studying the possibility of acceding to the 
1961 Convention on Illicit Drugs. The Government has appointed 
an interagency committee to study the issue. 
  "My opinion is that Vietnam should join this convention as 
soon as possible. We hesitated in the past because we did not 
have much knowledge of the issue," he said.

  [Text] Islamabad -- The three Southwest Asian states of 
Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan are producing an estimated 1,500 
to 3,000 metric tonnes of opium every year, a recent United 
Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) report 
states. 
  The report says, drug-related problems in the Southwest 
Asian 
sub-region, (covering Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan) are among 
the most serious in the world. 
  Despite efforts by the Governments to reduce demand, 
addiction to opium and heroin is rampant in this sub-region. 
  Detailing the local addiction in figures, the report notes 
that addiction rates have assumed alarming proportions in this 
region. 
  Pakistan reported 3 million drug addicts in 1993 of which 
about, 1.5 million were heroin and 162,000 opium addicts. The 
Government of Iran estimated some 500,000 drug addicts, of which 
some 350,000 were opium and 150,000 were heroin addicts. 
Figures for Afghanistan are not available. 
  It is estimated that more than half of the opium produced in 
the sub-region is consumed within the three countries. 
  Drug trafficking, however, is not just limited to the 
Southwest Asian sub-region, that has been transformed into one 
of world's largest drug producing and trafficking areas. Large 
quantities are also trafficked elsewhere in Asia and in other 
parts of the world. 
  Opium, morphine and heroin refining and trafficking is 
continuing to feed both local and foreign demand, the UNDCP 
report points out. 
  Scizures in Pakistan and Iran have established that the 
Iran/Pakistan/Afghanistan border areas are one of the principal 
narcotics trafficking areas in the world. Drug trafficking in 
these border areas involves large quantities of drugs, 
sophisticated criminal organisations and a great deal of 
violence. In terms of quantity and violence, the movement of 
morphine from Afghanistan directly and through Pakistan into 
Iran for Turkey is the main problem. 
  In 1993 alone authorities in Iran seized more than 25 metric 
tonnes of morphine, 2 metric tonnes of heroin and 63 metric 
tonnes of opium originating from this area. 
  In Pakistan (Balochistan) the law enforcement agencies also 
seized major amounts of opium, heroin and cannabis (hashish), 
more than 90 metric tonnes) last year. 
  Helmand province of Afghanistan is the main opium producing 
area supplying opium which is shipped directly into Iran or 
through Pakistan into Iran. Opium production estimates for 
Helmand suggest that it alone produces more than 50 per cent of 
the opium of the sub-region. 
  Most of the opium is processed into morphine at laboratories 
in Helmand and Nimroz (also in Afghanistan), from where it is 
shipped into Iran directly and through Pakistan into Iran. The 
ultimate destination of this morphine is Turkey and western 
countries where it is refined into white heroin. 
  Opium not transformed into morphine in Afghanistan is 
shipped 
from them directly into Iran or through Pakistan into Iran or 
remains in Pakistan to meet local demand. Some opium and heroin 
is trafficked through Balochistan to the coast. The opium 
transported to Iran is mostly for consumption there. 
  Cannabis (in the form of hashish) produced in Afghanistan 
rarely enters Iran, but is shipped in large quantities through 
Balochistan to the coast of southern Pakistan. In January this 
year, Pakistani authorities seized more than 50 metric tonnes of 
Hashish in one single seizure in southern Balochistan. 
  Southwest Asia has been engaged in the cultivation of opium 
poppies for local consumption for centuries. But, the 
transformation of the opium poppy into a major cash crop is a 
phenomenon of the last few decades. 
  There was dramatic increase in the poppy cultivation in the 
area comprising Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan, following 
the Soviet intervention in 1979, and the subsequent war in 
Afghanistan.

  [Text] For the narcotics police at Vienna's Schwechat 
Airport, Madal Beltran (42), a Spanish citizen who arrived in 
Vienna from Bangkok, gave the "clear" impression of being a 
"drug addict." When police experts searched him, they found 
heroin worth 1.5 million schilling hidden in a camera case. 
Moreover, they found statuettes that are probably also made of 
the same drug. 
  In the interrogation, the Spaniard admitted to being HIV 
positive and said that he had taken over the drugs from his 
fellow traveler Juan Ripoli Tocho (43), also a Spanish citizen. 
Both men have been arrested.

Sorensen: "Large-Scale (Massive) Search"] 
  [Excerpts] Hashish seizure: Fourteen people have been 
arrested so far after the largest hashish seizure in the history 
of Denmark. However, the police are still looking for 11 tons of 
hashish and three suspects. 
  With their massive raid Sunday [3 April] morning the police 
and custom officials had hoped to crush one of the 
best-organized hashish organizations in Denmark once and for 
all. Having monitored the gang's activities in their rooms, the 
police knew that the gang members were going to try to smuggle 
12.5 tons of Moroccan hashish into Denmark, but when the police 
raided the container ship Hela at Helnas Bay the morning of 
Easter Sunday, only 1.5 tons of hashish was found. 
  The police do not know what happened to the rest of the huge 
shipment beyond the fact that some of it was dumped at sea. Some 
of it might have been smuggled ashore before the ship reached 
shallow waters in southwestern Fyn bay during the night before 
Sunday. [passage omitted] 
  Over the next few days the police will search the bottom of 
Helnas Bay with a fine-tooth comb looking for the hashish which 
had been tossed overboard, and they are urging everybody in the 
area to keep an eye out for summerhouses that have unusual 
visitors.

<F P=106> [Article by Anders Wiig: "Police Are Looking for Kingpin in </F>
Hashish Case"] 
  [Excerpts] Easter catch: Police think that a 41-year-old 
man is one of the main figures behind the hashish smuggling on 
the coastal vessel Hela. Another suspect came to the police 
headquarters yesterday bringing his toothbrush. 
  The narcotics police in Copenhagen yesterday took the 
drastic 
step of adding the 41-year-old former hashish smuggler Kim 
Julskov Knudsen to the wanted list for being one of the main 
figures behind Easter's big smuggling case at Helnas Bay on 
South Fyn. 
  Knudsen is charged with being one of the men who instigated, 
planned, and financed the smuggling of about 6 tons of hashish 
from Morocco. Police made the greatest hashish coup in Denmark's 
history when the coastal vessel Hela was boarded in the waters 
off the coast of South Fyn. Four and a half tons of hashish has 
been confiscated; some during the raid and some later after 
being fished out of the bay. 
  Sixteen people are now in custody, and number 17--and one of 
the alleged top kingpins--is the wanted Knudsen. He was 
sentenced to one year in prison in a hashish case in the 
beginning of the 1980's and has been charged by the police with 
having supplied most of the circa 20 million kroner that was 
needed in order to finance the Hela's trip to Morocco to obtain 
the hashish. 
  Knudsen has perhaps escaped to Sweden or the Netherlands, 
but 
might be driving around in Denmark in a metallic blue Volvo 
station wagon with licence plate OS 28.117. He was gone at 0500 
Sunday [3 April] morning when the police stormed into his villa 
in the northwestern part of Copenhagen. 
  Asked what his profession or possible cover profession is, 
police commissioner Per Leo Jepsen says: "We do not know that. 
We call him independent or self-employed." Knudsen is 190 cm 
tall, with light blond hair, and a glass eye. 
<H5>  Brought Book as Pastime </H5>
  At 0800 Wednesday morning another old hashish smuggler came 
to police headquarters. It was a 42-year-old man who had also 
escaped the police Sunday. [passage omitted] 
  This 42-year-old has been charged both with the two 
unsuccessful hashish trips on the vessel Mary in 1992 and 1993 
and also with the 6-ton trip on Hela. Like one of the other men 
in custody he has also been imprisoned in 1975 in North Africa 
for smuggling hashish. 
  So far he has not said a word during questioning by the 
police. That is also the case for the 47-year-old man who was 
arrested in the same case the day before yesterday and who was 
also taken into custody yesterday. 
  Yesterday military divers brought up 63 packages each 
containing 25 kg of hashish from the ocean bottom near the coast 
of South Fyn. By yesterday the police had retrieved 179 packages 
with a total of 4,475 kg of hashish. There are still more 
packages on the ocean floor. "And we will find them all," the 
chief criminal inspector Per Larsen promised us.

Sorensen: "Kingpin Dried Fish in Gambia"] 
  [Text] Main Suspect: One of the people taken into custody 
in the hashish case from Helnas Bay has run a dried fish 
business in Gambia for many years. 
  One of the alleged key figures in the hashish case, the 
49-year-old TJ has since 1990 been running the company Tarco Co. 
Ltd., which is registered in Banjul in Gambia. In the village of 
Tanjae on the West African coast the Dane has build up a 
business of preparing, drying, and exporting fish, which both he 
and local fishermen had caught in the ocean outside of Gambia. 
  "TJ has been particularly popular among African fishermen 
because he got many things started and furnished local 
employment at his fish-drying business on the coast," we were 
told by the shipping agent Steen Hedemann who lives in Gambia 
where he received the news yesterday concerning the arrest of TJ 
in connection with the biggest hashish case in Denmark. 
  "I have helped TJ by keeping an eye on his operation when he 
was out fishing or at home with his family in Denmark, and I 
find it totally surprising that he has been arrested for 
smuggling hashish. He is not that type at all," Torben Hedemann 
says, having no idea as to what kind of people TJ has been in 
contact with in Denmark. "If he really is involved in this, he 
has either been enticed into it or pressured. His business in 
Gambia could not finance such a large investment.'' 
  ``Many Danish sailors have been down here to help TJ with 
the 
fishing part of the business while he built up the project on 
land. It is my impression that these were people he knew from 
his time as a fisherman in Denmark.'' 
  About six months ago, TJ got the idea of investing in a 
coastal vessel, and on 1 November he took over the Hela through 
his company Tarco Co. Ltd. from a captain from Bornholm for 
1,050 million Danish kroner [as published]. 
<H5>  Large Market for Coastal Vessels </H5>
  "There is a large market for small coastal vessels here 
where 
there is money to be made by carrying goods between the cities 
along the coast. The Hela has had many trips up and down the 
coast," Hedemann says. 
  The coastal vessel was built in 1952 in Lubeck where she was 
launched with the name of Stellaria, but the ship was registered 
with Svenska Lloyd under the name Salome. In connection with the 
purchase in November the Hela's Danish flag was exchanged for a 
flag of convenience from the Latin American nation of Belize.

<F P=106> [Article by Egon Balsby: "Political Compromise and No Money: </F>
Drug Initiative--Same Old Stuff"] 
  [Excerpts] This is compromise at its lowest common 
denominator! 
  That is the vein in which the government's recently 
announced 
drug law proposal was received. Three ministers labored months 
to produce an initiative that had been expected to supersede the 
present failed drug policy. 
  But: "It is hardly a revolution, closer to an expansion of 
the previous approach," said Per Kalund, chairman of the County 
Council Association. Even so, he is willing to go along with it 
because the counties will play a central role in the new 
structure. Among other things, they will supervise the whole 
methadone treatment program. 
  In contrast, the Physicians' Association was very critical 
of 
the plan. Chairman Torben Pedersen pointed out the plan's 
inadequate economic basis: 
  "It is clear from the proposal that the government does not 
have any intention of allocating the necessary funding for an 
approach that could improve the lot of drug addicts." 
  Instead, the government has tossed the ball to the counties 
and local government. The most concrete item in the proposal is 
a change in the law that guarantees that the district in which a 
drug addict resides will pay a portion of the treatment when the 
county deems treatment is necessary. 
  "All things being equal, a change in the law could 
facilitate 
an expansion of treatment programs and ensure more uniform 
treatment throughout the country," said Kalund. 
  He stressed, however, that an expansion of this kind would 
necessarily require additional financing, either through an 
increased general appropriation or higher county and local taxes. 
  But the government intends for the improvements to be made 
without an increase in public expenditure. [passage omitted] 
  According to the proposal, the problems drug addicts 
experience will be solved by expanding overnight shelter 
facilities. These have been drastically cut in recent years, but 
now they will be tried again. 
  At the same time, it is suggested that local authorities set 
up cooperative-type living arrangements along with various types 
of day centers that would offer addicts support on a daily basis. 
  Otherwise, both the goals and the methods for combating the 
ongoing battle against drugs is virtually identical to the 
present policy. 
  The government would like to step up prevention through new 
informational campaigns. The proposal also stresses the 
necessity for more intensive research in this field. 
  It is the government's basic intention to aim at prevention 
and treatment at the expense of law enforcement. Nevertheless it 
is clear from the proposal that police activity will be 
maintained at its present level. This means that the police will 
continue to rake in the major share of the resources available 
to drug abatement programs. 
  The numerous objections to police crackdown policy 
verbalized 
by prominent Danish experts such as High Court Judge Hans Henrik 
Brydsensholt, Public Prosecutor Erik Merlung, as well as by a 
number of other thoughtful people, did not in the end make the 
slightest dent in the politicians' mind-set. The proposal backed 
off from any consideration of liberalization. 
  The proposal states this very clearly: "No spokesman for 
legalization has been able to present a cohesive and viable 
alternative to the present law enforcement policy. To the 
contrary, there are solid arguments for rejecting this 
alternative." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cologne (DPA) -- The Cologne drug squad has busted 
a ring of Kurdish heroin dealers. As the police reported on 
Tuesday, 20 members of three extended Kurdish families who had 
carried out nationwide heroin deals in the area of Cologne, 
Bruehl, and Erftkreis were arrested. Now and then, profits from 
the drug deals were paid to the meanwhile banned Workers Party 
of Kurdistan, PKK, it was stated. Several kilograms of heroin 
were seized during the arrests. Investigations against another 
25 family members are still being conducted. 
  A family that, as the police assume, has lived exclusively 
on 
drug deals, is said to have sold about 40 kg of heroin since 
last summer. 
  According to the police, many young people, including 
13-year-old boys, were among the arrested persons of all age 
groups. It had been the strategy of the gang to send 
adolescents from eastern Turkey to Germany and to use them as 
couriers there, since they would have expected more lenient 
sentences in the event of their arrest.

  [Text] Political support is growing for the 
decriminalisation of drug use as investigations continue into a 
lethal supply of pure heroin that has caused the deaths of at 
least eight addicts this week. 
  Environment Minister Konstandinos Laliotis, a senior deputy 
of the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement, yesterday 
expressed support for the controlled distribution of drug 
substitutes such as methadone as part of a comprehensive 
rehabilitation programme. 
  His remarks during a radio interview found support from 
party 
officials across the political spectrum. A major overhaul of 
drug policies and their enforcement is expected to be announced 
next week. 
  Justice Minister Yeoryios Kouvelakis, meanwhile, has issued 
a 
directive to all prison officials banning the granting of prison 
leave to convicted drug dealers. It was prompted after drug 
kingpin Adem Huseinoglu, serving a 22-year sentence in Patras, 
failed to return after a five-day leave. 
  The recent heroin deaths have shocked Greeks, with surveys 
showing there are an estimated 400,000 users of hard drugs in 
Greece.

Cooperation Protocol Signed"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 13 -- The commander general of 
Italy's Carabinieri force, General Luigi Federici, with a 
mandate from the ministry of the interior, Thursday [12 May] 
signed a protocol agreement with his counterparts from France 
and Spain so that the police departments from the three 
countries can work more closely together, an official communique 
from the Carabinieri's general command reported here this 
evening. 
  Patrice Maynial signed for the French national gendarmerie, 
while Ferran Cardenal De Alemany signed for the Spanish Civil 
Guard. 
  The three police forces agreed to step up their ties within 
the framework of international accords and national norms, with 
regard to training, recruitment, the organization of services, 
the exchange of information and experience, scientific data and 
techniques, and the acquisition of new technologies. 
  The battle against drugs will figure highly in their 
cooperative efforts, plus, in addition to their crime-fighting 
activities, the three institutions also will promote protection 
of the environment and of the artistic heritage of their 
countries.

<F P=106> [Article signed PI/GA/WI: "Important Drug Trafficking </F>
Network Discovered in Center for Asylum Seekers in Niederwangen"] 
  [Text] Niderwangen (Bern), 10 May (ATS) -- A large network 
of Nigerian drug traffickers has been dismantled in the Canton 
of Bern. The center for asylum applicants in Niederwangen was 
used as the hub for this trafficking. A total of 10.8 kg of 
cocaine and 2.2 kg of heroin were seized and 30 individuals were 
arrested, according to the Bern police force. 
  The investigations were carried out in cooperation with the 
Central Narcotics Office; the police forces of the Cantons of 
Zurich, Fribourg, Tessin, Vaud, Geneva, Basel; and foreign 
police forces. The magistrate in charge of narcotics affairs 
and Bern cantonal police officials have announced that the 
investigations are now completed. 
  In 1992, the Bern police collected information on a group of 
traffickers, most of whom were Nigerian asylum applicants. At 
that time, 31 Nigerian traffickers were apprehended in 
Switzerland along with a total of 50 kg of drugs, mainly cocaine 
and heroin. 
<H5>  Hub </H5>
  The investigation led by the Central Narcotics Office made 
it 
possible to dismantle the network passing through Niederwangen; 
illegally obtained visas helped traffickers conduct their 
business. Late in 1992, suspicions prompted investigators to 
search the Niederwangen center, which turned out to be an 
important hub for international drug trafficking. 
  Until the summer of 1993, Nigerian carriers would come to 
Switzerland each week to deliver drugs. Several individuals 
were then arrested. The drugs were forwarded to other centers 
for refugees in Bern and disseminated all over Switzerland. The 
dealers used the profits from the sales to buy old cars, 
electronic and domestic appliances, and tools which they shipped 
to Nigeria. 
<H5>  Twenty-Two Individuals in Jail </H5>
  Of the 30 individuals apprehended after the 
investigations--other arrests are still possible--22, including 
three women, are currently being held in custody in Switzerland, 
Austria, Denmark, France, and the United States. In many cases 
it has been impossible to determine their real identity. The 
Bern police added that the quantity of drugs brought into 
Switzerland through this network undoubtedly exceeds the 10.8 kg 
of cocaine and the 2.2 kg of heroin that were seized, even 
though it has not been possible to say exactly how much.

correspondent: "Computer Link Will Trap Drug Smugglers"] 
  [Text] A computer intelligence system aimed at stifling 
massive drug and arms smuggling rackets using ports in Britain, 
France, Holland, Belgium and Germany is being developed by 
Customs officials. 
  The computer data base will hold intelligence on container 
cargoes, shipping and trading companies and smuggling trends. It 
will enable Customs officers to identify potential targets and 
alert search teams to be ready as ships dock. 
  Due to begin within four years, the computer would link 
British ports including Southampton, Felixstowe, Liverpool and 
London with Rotterdam, Antwerp, Le Havre, Hamburg and Bremen. 
  The link is an extension of an electronic mailing system 
with 
more than 200 terminals round Europe, and a container profile 
scheme being used in Britain and mainland Europe. The system is 
so successful that Dutch officials say they have a 50-75 per 
cent success rate with every container they search.

<F P=106> [Article by Richard Palmer: "Britain Is Key in Somali Drug </F>
Ring"] 
  [Text] A former Special Branch detective has been 
providing couriers to smuggle drugs around the world. Police 
suspect profits from the booming international trade are 
ultimately financing Somali warlords. 
  Bill Hamilton, who was sacked from the Metropolitan police 
four years ago because of business links with a convicted IRA 
terrorist, has become embroiled in the international trade in 
qat, a highly addictive drug cultivated in the Horn of Africa. 
  Britain has become the world's biggest clearing house for 
the 
drug, which is banned in many western countries but remains 
legal here. The Home Office, which monitors the drug, maintains 
it does not constitute a serious threat to British society 
because its use is restricted to a few thousand refugees from 
Africa. 
  However, drug abuse workers in areas of London populated by 
Somalis have become concerned at the harm that misuse of qat is 
causing to the refugees. They claim it is turning many of them 
into zombies and creating serious social problems. 
  Police and customs officers have also become concerned that 
the trade is helping to finance the clan leaders running the 
civil war in Somalia. They control some of the main areas where 
qat is grown and are thought to be behind the booming business 
in supplying the drug to Somali, Ethiopian and other refugee 
communities in countries where it is illegal. 
  The National Criminal Intelligence Service and customs 
officers in Britain estimate that at least 80 different 
syndicates are importing qat from Africa and then re-exporting 
it illegally to countries where it is banned. 
  Hamilton, a former Special Branch sergeant who worked at 
Heathrow, has used his knowledge of the system to fly British 
couriers into North America with suitcases full of qat plants, 
which are chewed to obtain an amphetamine-like high. He was 
sacked by Scotland Yard after an inquiry into a double-glazing 
business he had set up in Northern Ireland with a convicted IRA 
man. He now operates from west London, recruiting couriers in 
local pubs. 
  Many couriers have failed to consider the possible 
consequences of being caught. Some have been banned from further 
entry into the United States and one man is currently serving a 
six-month jail sentence in Finland, according to Peter Coutts, a 
courier recruited by Hamilton. 
  Coutts, 41, an ex-Reuter journalist from Isleworth, west 
London, was arrested last month with another Briton at 
Philadelphia after they flew in with four suitcases crammed with 
the drugs. "We were isolated, handcuffed and grilled. It was a 
pretty horrible experience," he said. 
  In the past year more than 1.5 tonnes of the drug smuggled 
from Britain has been confiscated in Scandinavia alone. Yet 
Hamilton, who was detained at Toronto airport 18 months ago for 
possessing the drug, remains unrepentant. Last week, he admitted 
involvement but insisted he had now severed his ties with the 
syndicate. "My involvement was largely on a casual self-employed 
basis. I never had an executive role and no financial stake in 
the courier business," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by David Millward: "Drug Dealers Caught With Guns </F>
Could Face Life Jail"] 
  [Excerpt] Drug dealers face the prospect of life sentences 
if caught with real or imitation guns. 
  Ministers plan to amend the Criminal Justice Bill to impose 
stiffer penalties on those responsible for a rising tide of 
drug-linked violence in inner-cities. 
  Involvement in trafficking and supply will be included 
alongside assault, theft, arson and resisting arrest as a 
specific offence under section 17 (2) of the 1968 Firearms Act. 
  The change would close a loophole that allowed traffickers 
to 
be treated less severely when arrested while holding a gun than 
someone involved in these other crimes who was similarly armed. 
  The clause now sets a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, 
an unlimited fine or both on conviction. 
  The Government has indicated it will accept proposals drawn 
up by the Home Office's Firearms Consultative Committee, chaired 
by Lord Kimball. 
  With the Criminal Justice Bill currently going through 
Parliament, the committee approached Mr Michael Howard, the Home 
Secretary, directly on the subject rather than wait to issue its 
annual report on firearms legislation. 
  Lord Kimball, a former Conservative MP, told the Home 
Secretary that his proposals would help "allay public concern" 
at the increased use of firearms in drugs-related offences. 
  Such concern was provoked by the murder of Pc Patrick Dunne, 
44, in Clapham, south London, last October. The community 
policeman is believed to have been the victim of one of a number 
of drugs gangs in London. 
  Police believe armed drugs gangs have also been operating in 
Moss Side, Manchester, south London and in several other cities 
across the country. 
  In October last year police discovered arms including a 
sub-machine gun and six pistols with a &pound;85,000 drug haul in 
Coventry. 
  Increasingly violent territorial battles between gangs has 
led to calls from police and politicians for action to curb 
their activities. 
  Explaining the need to change the law, Lord Kimball said: 
"There is a danger there will be a public reaction which will 
create unnecessary problems for legitimate users of firearms. 
This is something we are hoping to pre-empt." 
  There was support for the plans from Mr Peter Butler, Tory 
MP 
for Milton Keynes North East and a member of the all-party Home 
Affairs Committee. "It seems to be part of an excellent solution 
but I think there must be minimum sentences. 
  "I think there has been a groundswell of public concern 
about 
drugs and violence and this does seem to address both issues."

<F P=106> [Article by David Leppard, home affairs correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Senior police officers admit they are losing the 
fight against Yardie drug gangs because dozens of witnesses have 
been intimidated, bribed or blackmailed into not giving evidence 
in court. 
  Scotland Yard detectives say that at least six prosecutions 
against key Yardie figures for murder, drugs and firearms 
offences have collapsed during the past year because of witness 
"nobbling". 
  Senior officers fear that drug-related violence by the 
Jamaican gangs in London, Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol has 
spread so rapidly in the past year that concerted action is 
needed. The problem prompted recent calls to arm the police. 
  They are particularly concerned by the emergence of one gang 
in south London that has been linked to the murder of a 
policeman and the attempted murder of at least eight other 
officers since last October. 
  Gang members were implicated in the murder of PC Patrick 
Dunne, a community policeman in Clapham, south London, and in 
the attempted murder of two policemen in Brixton last month. In 
both cases gangsters resorted to the ritual of raising their 
guns in the air and firing shots in a formal "salute" of 
defiance before fleeing the scene. 
  The gang's members call themselves "Rude Boys" and have 
developed nicknames for their personal weapons, usually powerful 
Uzi semi-automatic machine guns. 
  "This is a very dangerous gang, whose violence has spread 
alarmingly," said Detective Superintendent John Jones, a Yardie 
expert. 
  "There are quite a large number of recent cases which have 
either been dropped or come to an unsatisfactory conclusion 
because prominent prosecution witnesses have either failed to 
attend court; or have completely lost their memory; or said that 
they made a mistake when they made their original statements," 
Jones said. He added that these witnesses had either been 
intimidated, bribed, or accused of betraying their own community. 
  Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Clark, Scotland Yard's 
deputy head of criminal intelligence, said witness intimidation 
in Yardie prosecutions had grown alarmingly. 
  Last year Michael Howard, the home secretary, told Paul 
Condon, the Metropolitan police commissioner, that the 
government viewed Yardie gangs as a serious threat to law and 
order. Condon set up a special intelligence-gathering squad to 
target the gangsters, but senior officers say the unit has 
failed to curb the increase in drug-related murders. 
  In the Brixton area of south London, there have been nine 
Yardie murders since the beginning of 1993. In northwest London, 
19 people were shot last year in attacks linked to Yardie 
gangsters. 
  Detectives say the murder rate among black people has more 
than doubled in the past five years. Much of the increase is 
blamed on warfare between rival gangs struggling for control of 
the lucrative market in crack, the cocaine derivative. 
  In one particularly shocking case, a young Jamaican woman 
was 
thrown out of the window of her 18th-floor north London council 
flat by Yardies. Police say the prosecution was withdrawn after 
witnesses were threatened. 
  Sir John Smith, president of the Association of Chief Police 
Officers, said that police chiefs and government ministers would 
have to act soon to tackle the need to protect witnesses and 
informants. "It is something we will need to concern ourselves 
about," Smith said. "There are more reports coming through that 
this sort of thing is happening." 
  British police were first alerted to the gangs, named after 
the backyards of Jamaica, by the FBI in the mid-1980s. The FBI 
said that Yardie "posses" have since branched out from dealing 
in crack to kidnapping, bank robberies, extortion and 
loan-sharking. 
  Scotland Yard detectives claim some Yardies in Britain and 
America are using torture as part of their reign of terror. 
"They are the most dangerous groups of sociopaths known to 
modern society," one officer said. 
  Police point to last year's change of government in Jamaica 
as a source of the growing problem. "Since then many gunmen 
previously employed by the authorities have found themselves 
without work and in many cases sought by the police," said 
Jones. "An ever-growing number of these people are now entering 
this country illegally and are resorting to indiscriminate 
violence."

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Bespalov: "Russian and Turkmenistan </F>
Special Services Wage Joint Struggle Against Drug Business"] 
  [Text] Rostov-na-Donu -- In Rostov staffers of the oblast 
administration of the federal counterintelligence service and 
the Turkmenistan national security committee have arrested a 
leader of the drug mafia for whom they were searching. 
  This X, a citizen of Turkmenistan, led a large criminal 
group 
which transported narcotics from Southeast Asia to Central Asia. 
In Rostov the mafioso hoped to lie low and acquire new contacts. 
  Employees of the Rostov counterintelligence administration 
press service believe this operation has been a very successful 
and remarkable one. On the one hand a palpable blow has been 
dealt to the drug mafia and on the other there has been a 
demonstration of the now so rare close collaboration and 
cooperation between the special services of republics of the 
former USSR in the struggle against organized crime.

"Tanks on the Move in Alma-Ata?"] 
  [Text] In addition to the bemedaled veterans, armed 
military details were to be encountered at all Alma-Ata's 
[Almaty's] intersections on Victory Day. An unpublicized state 
of emergency has been introduced in the Kazakhstani capital. 
Rumor has it that this was due to an attack on Bulat Abilov, 
president of the Kazakhstani firm Butya. According to other 
information, the reason was the escape of two convicts. The MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs] attributes it to the complex 
crime situation in Kazakhstan. 
  A city crime-fighting staff has been formed in Alma-Ata. It 
will operate until the capital of Kazakhstan becomes a safe 
city. All hotels, hostels, and suspect apartments are being 
checked over. In the last two days alone 11 kg of opium worth 
around $55,000 have been confiscated. All urban transport 
routes have begun to be "processed" as of yesterday.

<F P=106> [Article by KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA correspondents Irina </F>
Bakayeva and Tamara Kaleyeva: "A `Noose' Has Been Thrown Around 
the Neck of Crime. What Will Be the Result?"] 
  [Text] Lately the capital has been agitated by rumors, 
each more wild than the next. Allegedly there have been several 
assassination attempts, including on Ministry of Internal 
Affairs officers, on the president of the Butya company, Bulat 
Abilov, and on other famous people. 
  We called the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] press 
service and found out that these rumors were not news to them. 
  "We know of this," said the deputy chief of the MVD press 
center, Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Vulf. "This information is 
not true, however. All the persons whose names are being 
mentioned in 'unofficial chronicles' are alive and well." 
  "Nevertheless, residents of the capital noticed, for 
instance, unusual activism on the part of the militia over the 
past few days. Why?" 
  Vulf said: In the past the militia has always worked in a 
special mode during holidays. The same was true over the past 
few days: The militia was put on a round-the-clock operation 
schedule, with reinforced patrols--that is why there was more 
special equipment on the streets than usual, and patrols were 
armed with submachine guns. This is not at all related to a 
crime surge. On the contrary, over the past four months the 
total number of crimes in the republic has dropped by 7 percent, 
and criminal investigations--by 10 percent. The number of 
murders, robberies, and assaults has dropped. In order to 
maintain this trend, the republic organs of internal affairs 
conducted Operation "Kuryk" ("Noose") a few days ago. Over a 
period of three days 1,288 crimes were registered, of which 888 
were solved while the trail was hot. We also detained 1,153 
suspects--63 for inflicting grave bodily harm, 92--for 
hooliganism, and 21--for assault. "Noose" also caught 252 drug 
addicts, from whom we confiscated 22.5 kg of drugs. On the basis 
of these facts, 1,069 criminal cases have been initiated. 
  In the course of the operation 633 units of firearms were 
confiscated, 55 stolen cars were found, and 4,152 persons were 
delivered to medical sobering-up facilities. We checked 
dormitories, hotels, and "suspicious" apartments. It turned out 
that 425 foreign citizens were living in Kazakhstan not only 
without a residence permit but even without a passport. One 
hundred thirteens persons were expelled from the republic. 
  These are the facts we were given at the MVD press center. 
And at the offices of the Butya company we were told that Bulat 
Abilov is in good health and actually is on a business trip to 
Japan. 
  Of course, where there is smoke there is fire. But the 
rumors surrounding the incident that took place on 5 May near 
the famous Arasan bathhouse have taken on the appearance of a 
smoke-screen: Rumor had it that one of the top officials in the 
republic MVD died in a mafia score-settling incident. 
  In reality the incident was far more prosaic. At 2330 
Colonel 
A. Seitov, chief of the MVD criminal investigations department, 
who lives near Imeni 28 Panfilov Soldiers Park, was taking his 
dog for a walk as usual. This time his whole family had decided 
to get a bit of fresh air: A. Seitov himself, and his wife, son, 
and daughter-in-law. Some intoxicated young men, who were 
"having fun" at a commercial kiosk near the bathhouse, took a 
liking to the beautiful dog. Two of the six confronted the 
family and pulled out a gun: "Give us the dog or we will kill 
it." 
  Admonishments, verbal warnings, and even an MVD officer ID 
produced no effect: The drunks continued to brandish their 
weapon. Then the colonel pulled out his standard-issue weapon 
and fired a warning shot in the air. Instead of coming back to 
their senses, the drinkers attacked the colonel and wounded his 
daughter- in-law. Then A. Seitov, too, used his weapon. One of 
the attackers-- B. Alpysbayev, 30-year-old director of the 
bathhouse men's department--was killed, and the other one was 
wounded. 
  The procuracy initiated criminal proceedings against the 
attackers. It was found that A. Seitov's use of a firearm had 
been justified. 
  Thus, there was no "score-settling;" nevertheless, an attack 
on, of all people, a top criminal investigations official is 
indeed troublesome: After all, we mere mortals do not carry 
standard-issue weapons for self-defense...

  [Text] Dushanbe May 16 TASS -- Special units of 
Tajikistan's Interior Ministry and the country's special 
services are mounting a large-scale operation "Mak-94" 
(Poppy-94) to locate and eliminate plantations of opium poppy 
and hemp, an uphill job because most of the plantations, some of 
which cover tens of hectares, are located in the mountainous 
regions of northern and eastern Tajikistan, difficult-of-access. 
This was announced in an interview with ITAR-TASS by First 
Deputy Interior Minister of Tajikistan, Major-General Gennadiy 
Blinov. 
  He explained that the owners of such plantations are, as a 
rule, were alarmed and often have tested ties with local 
authorities. [as received] 
  The wave of drug-trafficking and drug abuse continues to 
sweep Tajikistan, which has become a major base from which 
narcotics are delivered to near abroad and Western Europe, 
Gennadiy Blinov said. He stressed that practically one half of 
crimes committed in the republic is associated with the 
narco-business. 
  Since the beginning of this year, Tajikistan's security 
forces have suppressed 19 attempts at illegal exports of 
unprocessed opium and hashish and located tens of underground 
syndicates specialising in manufacturing and storing narcotics, 
the general said. A total of 200 kilograms of drugs have been 
seized. 
  However according to General Blinov, the main flow of drugs 
comes from neighbouring Afghanistan to Tajikistan's 
Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, where several drug barons 
run mafia-like groups. According to Gennadiy Blinov, the drug 
flow from Afghanistan can be suppressed by tightening control 
over the Pamir stretch of the Tajik-Afghan border, which 
regrettably remains highly transparent. 
  For a number of reasons only between 15 and 20 in each 
hundred of crimes associated with narcotics are ever exposed, 
the general said. He called for a comprehensive state programme 
and concerted efforts of the security agencies of all 
Commonwealth member-countries, whose ties have weakened 
considerably since the break-up of the Soviet Union.

  [Text] Prosecutor General de Greiff faces a difficult 
situation after a group of U.S. congressmen rejected his 
participation as a speaker at a World Bank conference. 
Interestingly enough, several congressmen changed their minds 
following an intense diplomatic effort by de Greiff. 
  Despite his temper and nature, lately de Greiff has been 
tapping his diplomatic skills. First, he used his new talent on 
U.S. Senator John Kerry, who had criticized him harshly. De 
Greiff's telephone conversations with Kerry 15 days ago had such 
an effect that Kerry is considering coming to Colombia at de 
Greiff's invitation for a closer examination of the fight 
against the drug cartels. However, de Greiff went even further. 
De Greiff began contacts with U.S. judicial authorities, 
including U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, whose reaction to de 
Greiff's endeavor is not yet known. 
  The "Seven O'Clock Newscast" learned de Greiff has claimed 
that his views regarding drug legalization are purely academic 
and do not jeopardize the Colombian Government's policies. 
However, the Prosecutor General's Office and the government 
expect, as proof of its good relations with the U.S. Government, 
the prompt dispatch of evidence linking confessed 
drug-trafficker Ivan Urdinola with a case being currently 
reviewed in a Florida court implicating him with the trafficking 
of heroin in the United States. Twelve persons have been 
detained in Colombia and the United States in connection with 
this case.

<F P=106> [Report by Rodolfo Rojas-Zea] </F>
  [Text] The Attorney General Office's [PGR] Planning Center 
for Drug Control [Cendro] has said that the area devoted in 
Mexico to narcotics crops "increases continually due to, among 
other things, the poverty created for years by low agriculture 
yields, the lack of infrastructure, and the low prices of 
agricultural products." 
  Cendro added that, after narcotics crops on thousands of 
hectares in northern Mexico were razed, drug traffickers moved 
to the southern part of the country, devastating forest areas in 
Veracruz, Puebla, and the tropical jungle in Oaxaca, Chiapas, 
Tabasco, Campeche, and Quintana Roo. 
  The PGR has admitted that production of narcotics, mainly 
opium, has increased in nearly every southern state in the 
country as a consequence of the reactivation of the opium market 
in the United States and Europe. 
  Oaxaca is one of the four states where opium fields are most 
abundant. These fields are located in San Vicente Coatlan, 
Coicoyan del las Flores, Miahuatlan de Porfirio Diaz, Oaxaca de 
Juarez, Pinotepa de Don Luis, San Baltasar Chichicapam, and San 
Carlos Yautepec, all of them in La Mixteca and the Southern 
Sierra Madre, where it borders with Guerrero state and the 
Tehuantepec isthmus. 
  Cendro reports that as a result of unemployment in Oaxaca, 
more than 2,000 Zapotec, Mixtec, and Chinantec Indians have been 
hired by drug traffickers to grow marijuana and poppy on their 
plots of land and store marijuana in their storage areas. This 
happens in Ejutla de Crespo, Ixtepec, and San Miguel del Puerto 
municipalities. 
  In Chiapas, Indian communities and Guatemalans, working 
together near the border with Guatemala, participate in the 
production of drugs. The Papaloapan River basin, one of the 
largest production areas, located on the border between Oaxaca 
and Veracruz, has begun to be used as a distribution center by 
drug traffickers who force peasants to grow narcotics crops. 
  According to the Cendro report, the Pacific region was 
Mexico's largest production area from 1988 to 1992, and it 
elicited the strongest action by the authorities. 
  Sinaloa was the top marijuana producer, with 20.90 percent 
of 
the total that was destroyed throughout the country. Michoacan 
was second. In Jalisco, the area where marijuana was destroyed 
in 1992 and 1993 was three times larger than in 1991, 
particularly in the municipalities of San Sebastian, Tequila, 
and Villa Corona. Other municipalities have been more active, 
such as Hostotipanquillo, Magdalena, Colotlan, Pihuamo, 
Tecalitlan, and Ciudad Guzman, where vigilance was improved with 
1,500 soldiers, who have intensified the fight against the 
growing, harvesting, and transporting of drugs. This fight has 
been supported by Mexican Air Force and PGR helicopters. 
  In Sinaloa, which ranks as the largest grower of poppy, the 
area where this crop was destroyed increased by 74 percent in 
1992 and 1993, as compared to 1991. The destruction of crops 
took place mostly in Badiraguato, Mazatlan, and Choix. Last 
year, 3,552 hectares planted with poppy were razed in the state. 
  The municipalities most affected were Choix, Cosala, 
Badariguato, Ahome, and San Ignacio, where peasants continue to 
be hired on a large-scale basis to grow and harvest the 
narcotic. Irrigation systems and tools were observed in some of 
the fields that were destroyed. 
  Cendro says that the production of marijuana has been steady 
in most Nayarit municipalities. Nevertheless, the usage of land 
increased by as much as 80 percent in 1993, mostly in the 
municipalities of Ixtlan, Huajicori, Compostela, Nayar, and San 
Pedro. 
  In Durango, eight times more marijuana was destroyed in 1993 
than in 1992. The increase in the identification and 
destruction of marijuana fields has been marked. The 
municipalities where this problem is greater are Armeria, 
Tecoman, Minatitlan, and Coquimatlan. This situation is caused 
by the weather conditions both along the coast and in the 
highlands. 
  In states where crops were less abundant, the strategy 
changed. This is what happened in Atolinga, Zacatecas State, 
where the Federal Judicial Police discovered marijuana fields 
interspersed with corn fields. 
  In the Pacific zone, regarded as one of the largest 
producers, 24.7 percent more narcotics fields were destroyed 
than last year. 
  In 1992, the eradication of poppy plantations in the area 
increased by 24.69 percent compared with 1991, mostly in 
Guerrero State. There, 4,071.4 hectares, which represented 35.1 
percent of the total nationwide, were destroyed in 1992. Poppy 
plantations were located in the municipalities of Ajuchitlan, 
Copanatoyac, Coyuca de Catalan, Chilapa de Alvarez, 
Chilpancingo, General Heliodoro Castillo, Iguala, Jose Azueta, 
Leonardo Bravo, and Metlatonoc. 
  The Cendro contends that physical and socioeconomic 
conditions in Michoacan favor a high level of drug trafficking. 
As a result, Michoacan is one of the major producers of 
marijuana and, according to statistics, 3,231 hectares were 
eradicated during the 1992-93 period, which is a 60-percent 
increase over the previous year. 
  The mountains of Acuitzio, Apatzingan, and Tacambaro 
continue 
to be areas for growing illegal crops while Nuevo Urecho, 
Penjamillo, Los Reyes, and San Lucas are municipalities that 
have recently joined the program to eradicate illegal crops. 
  Heroin is produced in Michoacan, a state where there is 
virtually no eradication of poppy, which leads to the assumption 
that the opium comes from Guerrero State. 
  As for central Mexico, the Cendro reveals that drug crops on 
plots equipped with an irrigation infrastructure on ranches 
owned by Juan Jose Quintero Payan were detected in San Miguel de 
Allende. In addition, marijuana plantations have been detected 
in Dolores Hidalgo and Juventino Rosas. 
  A field of marijuana ready to be harvested was found in 
Tejupilco, Mexico State. Mexico State is considered a broad 
area for sowing and growing marijuana, particularly places such 
as the hills of San Vicente, San Miguel Grande, the highlands of 
San Pedro Limon, and along some of the road to Los Bejucos. 
<H5>  They Even Have Irrigated Agricultural Areas </H5>
  There is a generalized increase in the lands used for 
growing 
marijuana, expanding its scope of influence in the central area 
and incorporating new plots equipped with irrigation systems. 
  This practice promotes the relocation of this crop in areas 
that, because of their characteristics, yield a larger amount 
and higher-quality drug. These practices have been detected in 
areas bordering San Luis Potosi-Hidalgo-Veracruz and 
Guerrero-Michoacan. 
  As for northern Mexico, the problem of drug crops in 
Chihuahua is increasing, especially in the region inhabited by 
the Tepehuan and Tarahumara Indians. 
  In those regions, the Cendro notes, given the poverty levels 
among native groups, illegal crops are easily incorporated. In 
1992-1993, there was a determined antidrug effort by the 
authorities in Baborigame. 
<H5>  Chihuahua, Durango, and Sinaloa: the "Golden Triangle" </H5>
  Drug-sowing in the Tepehuan region include the States of 
Chihuahua, Durango, and Sinaloa. This area--also known as "the 
Golden Triangle"--possesses the best conditions for the 
production of marijuana and poppy among all areas in northern 
Mexico. The Tepehuan region garners elements such as 
geographical isolation, poverty and social backwardness, which 
make it particularly attractive to drug traffickers. 
  The emergence of drug production in southern Baja California 
State is troubling. In 1992-1993, marijuana plantations, 
equipped with a modern and working irrigation system, were 
eradicated for the first time since 1984 in the municipality of 
Comondu. Marijuana plantations have also been found near 
Guerrero Negro. 
  "Mobile" crops represent an option for drug traffickers 
because they can be removed easily and rapidly if the 
authorities detect them. During 1992, there was an increase in 
the eradication of plantations of this type in the States of 
Sinaloa and Sonora. 
  In the months of July, August, and September 1992, 1,559 
hectares of marijuana were destroyed in Sinaloa and Sonora, thus 
increasing to 33 percent the average of eradicated marijuana 
registered during the same period in the three previous years. 
  However, reports indicate a reversal for illegal crops in 
the 
municipalities of Alamos and Ures, Sonora State. The 
eradication of mobile crops in El Venadito's ejido in the 
municipality of Alamos, where marijuana was grown in plastic 
bags is worth mentioning. 
  Regarding poppy production, 2,713.6 hectares of poppy were 
destroyed in the states near the northern border. These 2,713.6 
hectares represent 23.6-percent of the total destroyed 
nationwide, and represents a 136.4-percent, 44.2 percent, and 
77.2 percent increase compared with the three previous years, 
respectively, the Cendro ends.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondents Salvador Guerrero Chipres and </F>
Jesus Aranda and special correspondent Aurelio Garibay] 
  [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 15 May -- According to 
estimates made public by the Attorney General's Office (PGR), 
drug trafficking groups operating in Mexico will receive gross 
revenues totalling about $30 billion this year--an amount that 
represents one-sixth of the value of annual cocaine consumption 
in the United States. 
  According to a confidential report prepared by the PGR and 
obtained by LA JORNADA, the annual drug market in the United 
States has expanded from $76 billion to $181 billion. Even the 
U.S. Senate Narcotics Subcommittee has reported that nearly $100 
billion originating from drug trafficking is held in U.S. banks. 
  According to the PGR, "the value of the world's illegal drug 
market is estimated at close to $500 billion," making it the 
underground financial sector with "the highest growth rate in 
the world." 
  Based on figures and documents prepared by the PGR, which 
have been reported to the president of the republic, and based 
on forecasts prepared by organizations such as the Hemispheric 
Information System for Narcotics Control (SHICD), which is "an 
intelligence network" designed to fight drug trafficking on the 
continent, it has been established that Mexico's crude oil and 
non- crude oil export revenues, in addition to the overall value 
of the nation's manufacturing industry, represent "an amount 
comparable" to the total gross revenues earned by domestic drug 
trafficking. 
  However, the portion of these revenues that remains in 
Mexico 
"is unknown, although most of it is thought to go overseas." 
  The previously mentioned amount is equivalent to four times 
the value of 1993 crude oil exports reported by the Bank of 
Mexico, which amounted to $7.418 billion. 
  In 1992, the federal government warned in a document 
entitled 
"Drug Control in Mexico" that resources controlled by narcotics 
traffickers and their gross revenues are capable of infiltrating 
any sector: "This calls for special attention in terms of 
protecting the nation's economy and, more important, the 
regional economy in order to prevent drug trafficking assets 
from becoming the nerve center of economic activity." 
  According to the same document, so far in 1994 the total 
revenues received by criminal organizations amount to nearly 
four times Mexico's total public and private foreign debt. 
Although significant, this amount must also be appreciated in 
terms of the material and human costs associated with operations 
leading to drug seizures. 
  One kilogram of high-grade cocaine in the U.S. retail market 
can be bought for a price ranging between $80,000 and $100,000. 
  Nearly 178 tons of cocaine where seized and destroyed during 
the first four years of this administration. 
  In October 1993, Morelos Governor Jorge Carrilo Olea said: 
"Drug trafficking has created its own culture, its own social 
structure, and its own safety controls, and, in some countries, 
it constitutes an element that influences and weighs heavily on 
society and the state, even threatening to subjugate them." Mr. 
Carrillo was at one time in charge of the PGR's 
Counter-Narcotics Office and also a presidential adviser 
specializing on drug related issues. 
  He also said: "The principle of profitability and capital 
return makes this phenomenon very different from other illegal 
practices. This is a criminal network which, following the 
pattern of an open and free market, assumes the shape of 
multinational corporations with a management, organizational, 
and operational structure that reflect pure business concerns." 
  Carrillo also pointed out that the enormous drive behind 
drug 
trafficking includes access to sizable financial assets and the 
illegal flow of resources that penetrate the economies of 
developing and consumer countries, as well as those nations that 
serve as bridges. In addition, there are the widespread 
international criminal organizations which "in some cases, 
infiltrate and erode government structures responsible for 
controlling them," such as has occurred in Mexico, according to 
a public acknowledgement by PGR authorities. 
  The third element is the constant association between drug 
trafficking and illegal weapons trafficking, "which constitutes 
a formidable threat to stability and regional peace, especially 
in the case of Latin America." 
  It is worth noting that several insurgent movements have 
been 
linked by various South American governments to weapons 
trafficking. 
  Here in Mexico, according to statements by Subcommander 
Marcos, the weapons used by the EZLN [Zapatista National 
Liberation Army] were purchased on the black market and include 
weapons seized by PGR agents from drug traffickers. The PGR has 
not commented on the rebel's statements. 
  In October 1993, General Carrillo Olea, who is also a former 
national security director, indicated: "The struggle waged by 
the police and the military against organized criminal 
organizations has upset society and shaken the political sector 
in a very significant way. Therefore, without denying the value 
of these resources, it is important to examine this carefully 
and to maintain the firm resolve to restrain its progression. 
The objective in this war is not to destroy the enemy, because 
this is impossible. The goal is to keep the enemy under 
control." 
  He added: "Wars against drugs trafficking expose 
institutions 
to ever-increasing risks of corruption. One of the most 
disappointing lessons of the campaigns waged against global drug 
trafficking has been to observe how institutions responsible for 
implementing the law are powerless against internal corruption 
campaigns staged by the drug lords. All contact with 
traffickers, even as enemies, increases the possibility of 
corruption."

  [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 14 April--The financial, 
political, and criminal movements that have occurred in the 
state since January 1993 are a result of destabilizing 
activities on the part of drug traffickers seeking to become 
established in this town, and in Mexicali, and Ensenada. This 
claim was made today by the state's attorney, Juan Francisco 
Franco Rios. 
  He added that there was an obvious migration of individuals 
coming from Sinaloa, Michoacan, Tamaulipas, and Puebla, who have 
settled in Mexicali and appear to have large fortunes. 
  He declared: "The `narcos' want to cool the atmosphere in 
Tijuana," because of the serious conflicts and problems posed, 
as well as the large concentration of police forces combating 
crimes against health that have arrived as a result of the 
assassination of Archbishop Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. The 
attorney reached the foregoing conclusion after having 
investigated several crimes, including a murder committed in 
Mexicali. He noted that the one presumed guilty "is a person 
with great economic potential, the owner of 40 ranches and a 
fleet of yachts." 
  Franco Rios reiterated the statement made by Governor 
Ernesto 
Ruffo Appel on the day of the signing of the Pact for Baja 
California, urging businessmen not to become associated with the 
drug trade. 
  The leader of the Party of the Democratic Revolution and 
councilman in the state's 14th town hall, Javier Gonzalez 
Monroy, for his part, commented: "The battle against the drug 
traffic obviously has failed to bring about the desired results, 
because there are political rivalries on the various levels of 
government responsible for that task: federal, state, and 
municipal authorities." 
  He stressed that an impetus must be given to reforms of the 
Federal Penal Code that would enable the Baja California State 
Attorney's Office to take action aimed at solving the problems. 
  He added that large numbers of "informers" have registered 
as 
candidates for the State Judicial Police Academy, noting that 
this should have been supervised by the local judicial branch. 
  The secretary general of the Revolutionary Confederation of 
Workers in the state, Jose Maria Gonzalez Escobedo, declared: 
"There is a power vacuum in the state, but it is impossible for 
the citizens to remain at the mercy of criminals." 
  Finally, he described the Pact for Baja California as "a 
signpost indicating that they want to improve security."

  [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 23 April--After asserting 
that the drug traffic has infiltrated the State Judicial Police 
[PJE] ranks, the state's attorney, Francisco Molina, declared: 
"An investigation will be opened among this department's 
approximately 1,200 agents, to learn about their income and 
lifestyle." 
  During a press conference, Molina was more explicit, stating 
that the drug traffic has infiltrated not only the police ranks 
in Chihuahua, but also the banks, through money laundering, as 
well as the real estate business, concealing wealth produced by 
drug sales through the purchase of residences. 
  He also remarked that the Attorney General's Office Internal 
Affairs Department will expand its action, including in its 
investigations socioeconomic studies of State Judicial Police 
agents, as well as of agents and experts from the Public 
Prosecutor's Office. 
  He stressed that, after the audits to assess the integrity 
of 
the personnel and their performance in the administration of 
justice, an attempt will be made to prevent suspicious 
procedures or the drawing up of records that do not coincide 
with the facts. 
  He noted that, in the investigation to be conducted of all 
members of the PJE, there must be consistency between what they 
earn and the circumstances under which they live. Their 
socioeconomic level will be observed, including the cost of 
their homes, cars, and assets in general. 
  Returning to the topic of the drug traffic's infiltration, 
he 
commented: "It has affected various structures, and we cannot 
claim that this evil has been eliminated here, because it still 
persists." 
  Finally, he admitted that, although Chihuahua is not a 
trafficking site, it is, unfortunately, one used for drug 
growing and production.

  [Text] Federal Judicial Police personnel detailed to 
Guerrero State uncovered a clandestine laboratory for processing 
and refining opium gum into heroin, seizing a shipment of 5,500 
grams of the narcotic, worth an estimated 35 million new pesos. 
During the operation, conducted in the municipality of Eduardo 
Neri and complying with a search warrant issued by the first 
district judge of criminal proceedings, with headquarters in 
Chilpancingo, the federal forces arrested a presumed drug 
trafficker. 
  According to the briefing report submitted to the Federal 
Judicial Police general director, Adrian Carrera Fuentes, by the 
force's deputy commissioner in Guerrero State, Jose Pulido 
Marin, the processing center was located at No. 10 Allende 
Street, in the San Sebastian district of the settlement of 
Zumpango del Rio. The action followed several investigations of 
chemicals arriving at that domicile, and of strong odors emitted 
there at night. 
  With the data collected by federal agents, the federal 
social 
representative requested that the pertinent judge grant a search 
warrant to inspect the domicile. When implemented, it enabled 
them to discover the clandestine laboratory, where they captured 
the presumed drug dealer identified as Enrique Dimas Gonzalez, 
with 35 million new pesos' worth of drugs in his possession. 
  During the execution of the judicial warrant, the agent of 
the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, accompanied by the 
aforementioned court's clerk, noted the presence of a loaded 
7.65-caliber squad pistol, a 22-caliber rifle, and 21 useful 
22-caliber cartridges. 
  Commander Marin also reported that various implements were 
found on the site, such as trays, jugs containing alcohol, bags 
of coarse and fine salt, two fumigators, a galvanized vat, and 
adhesive tape for wrapping the packages of heroin. 
  Moreover, the federal social representative confiscated a 
late-model pickup truck with Guerrero State registration, also 
carrying metal containers used in the aforementioned laboratory. 
  In connection with this case, the representative of the 
Attorney General's Office in the state, Joel Ortiz Hernandez, 
stressed that an investigation is being made of the possible 
participation of other persons presumably assigned to transport 
the narcotic to the U.S. drug market. He noted that, had they 
done so, thousands of doses would have been put into circulation.

  [Text] The changes at the Attorney General's Office [PGR] 
are linked to the results of the struggle against drug 
trafficking. Of the four attorneys general who have left their 
post, three have fallen into disgrace. They were fired for 
their inability to fight drug trafficking and only one of them, 
Jorge Carpizo McGregor, obtained positive results. This served 
to promote him to a higher position: government secretary. 
  In a PGR analysis of the administrations of the four 
attorneys general this institution has had and is expected of 
the fifth appointed in this six-year administration, it is noted 
that Carpizo McGregor was the one who achieved the greatest 
control of the PGR. He controlled "up to 35 percent," the 
remainder (65 percent) was controlled by the large drug 
trafficking organizations and the territories they managed. 
  Of the other three attorneys general, Enrique Alvarez del 
Castillo was considered the most negligent. He never established 
any type of control of the PGR. During his administration, the 
drug cartels appointed and removed government officials. During 
Ignacio Morales Lechuga's administration, up to 15 percent was 
under his control, although he was forced to resign when that 
control dropped to 5 percent. 
  During Carpizo's administration, control of the PGR rose to 
35 percent, while during Diego Valades' administration, control 
was lost once again as he surrounded himself with officials who 
had "dubious" backgrounds. The percentage of control fell to 10. 
  Humberto Benitez Trevino, the fifth attorney general, to a 
certain extent has been appointed to direct blows against drug 
trafficking, but his main concern is the electoral problems and 
the crimes that may arise. 
<H5>  First Attorney General </H5>
  1 December 1988 to 21 May 1991. 
  Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, former Jalisco governor, was 
appointed attorney general by President Carlos Salinas. He took 
over the post on 1 December 1988. 
  Without any control of the PGR, Alvarez del Castillo 
delegated the PGR's main duties to Javier Coello Trejo, who he 
appointed deputy attorney general in charge of combating drug 
trafficking. According to the PGR analysis, Coello Trejo gave 
support to cartel "A" in Tamaulipas led by Juan Garcia Abrego 
which competed with cartel "B" in the Pacific, led by Armando 
Carrillo Fuentes. In addition to the above, Coello Trejo and 
his police officers acted with impunity. The cases of rapes and 
kidnappings of women in which his officers were involved damaged 
even further his image. 
  From 1989 to 1990, the drug-trafficking heyday continued 
until the murder of Norma Corona, the president of the Human 
Rights Commission of Sinaloa, on 21 May 1990. Citizens' 
pressure forced Salinas to organize a National Commission for 
Human Rights (CNDH). 
  Salinas placed Jorge Carpizo, former president of the 
National Autonomous University of Mexico, at the helm of the 
CNDH. Salinas was forced to give total support to Carpizo. 
This in turn resulted in the fall of Alvarez del Castillo, who 
had lost control of the PGR, and Coello Trejo on 21 May 1991. 
<H5>  Second Attorney General </H5>
  22 May 1991 to 4 January 1993. 
  Ignacio Morales Lechuga, the new attorney general, appointed 
Jorge Carrillo Olea to replace Coello Trejo. He was not 
appointed as deputy attorney general, however, but as 
coordinator in the struggle against drug trafficking. The new 
coordinator's struggle against drug trafficking took off until 
it confronted Hector Palma, alias "El Guero," who was engaged in 
a struggle with capo Miguel Felix. This resulted in a shootout 
and a massacre among drug traffickers in Sinaloa and Tijuana, 
territories controlled by these gangs. 
  At the same time, a confrontation took place between "El 
Chapo" Guzman and the Arrellano Felix gang when the former 
entered the heroin market in addition to stealing three cocaine 
shipments from the Arellano Felix gang. 
  During Morales Lechuga's administration attempts were 
initiated to reduce capo Garcia Abrego's influence in the PGR, 
given that in the previous administration under Alvarez del 
Castillo, Garcia Abrego designated deputy district attorneys, 
delegates to the states, and distributed large sums of money. 
  Although during Morales Lechuga's administration there was 
an 
attempt to reduce the drug cartels' influence, Garcia Abrego 
influenced PGR decisions at the highest levels, Arellano Felix 
at the mid-level, and Amado Carrillo at the lower level. 
<H5>  Third Prosecutor </H5>
  5 January 1993 to 10 January 1994 
  When Jorge Carpizo initiated his administration at the PGR, 
he left Carrillo Olea at the forefront of the struggle against 
drugs. Nevertheless, from day one it was noted that Carpizo 
would not follow in the steps of Ignacio Morales. He started by 
taking control of his office and learning the PGR reality, which 
he began to control. 
  "With Carpizo at the helm, none of the PGR officials budged, 
they all walked a straight line--at least that was the 
appearance. At any time, a special investigation group could 
surprise them and if any irregularity was uncovered they lost 
their jobs or they ended up in jail. This instilled fear in 
many of the officials," remarked one of the sources consulted. 
  Everything went well for Carpizo until 1 January 1994 when 
the insurrection took place in Chiapas. Beginning in January, a 
"witch hunt and repression" was initiated in all the nation's 
police institutions as a result of this armed conflict. 
  At that time, from the Center of National Security at the 
Government Secretariat, Fernandez de Villar attempted to involve 
Carpizo in this "with hunt and repression." However, the 
attorney general cleverly pointed out that the PGR had nothing 
to do with the Chiapas conflict, therefore, it was not its 
responsibility. 
<H5>  Fourth Attorney General </H5>
  11 January 1994 to 13 May 1994 
  Diego Valades, who came from the Federal District 
Prosecutor's Office, came to the PGR with the mission and with 
the same line of conduct as Carpizo. Nevertheless, Valades' 
problem was that he sought political posts with greater 
responsibility such as Queretaro Governor or a seat on the 
Supreme Court of Justice. This took up his time as well as much 
of the push Carpizo gave to the PGR. The PGR began to fall by 
the way side. 
  Valades appointed to his work team deputy attorneys general 
who were publicly questioned for being corrupt such as Rene 
Gonzalez de la Vega and Alfonso Cabrera. Moreover, he made 
important changes in PGR representatives at several 
institutions; this allowed drug trafficking to blossom. 
  In addition to this, Valades made a mistake when he 
attempted 
to present new charges against Mario Aburto--Luis Donaldo 
Colosio's murderer--for "false testimony." Aburto had never 
declared he was telling the truth before any judicial authority. 
Valdes also made a mistake by fighting the PAN [National Action 
Party] team that governs Baja California, while he conducted 
operations and made statements that placed the PGR's legality in 
doubt. 
  This attorney general felt a great deal of pressure and 
anger, first because a Special Prosecutor's Office was not 
created for the Colosio case, and second for the creation of the 
National Public Security Coordinator, headed by Arsenio Farell. 
<H5>  Fifth Prosecutor </H5>
  14 May 1994 to ? 
  Humberto Benitez Trevino took over the post of attorney 
general on Saturday. His main challenge is not the struggle 
against drug trafficking, rather it will be to combat electoral 
crimes.

  [Text] The Office of the Attorney General of the Republic 
[PGR] will hold a "Refresher Course in Forensic Chemical 
Analysis of Narcotics and Psychotropics," according to an 
announcement made by that department yesterday. Its purpose is 
to analyze the technology used in recognizing the various 
formats of drugs and narcotics, to study the organization of 
laboratories for narcotics research, and to examine the 
legislation on the subject. 
  The federal justice institution noted that updating the 
expert study of chemical reagents used to identify cocaine, 
marijuana, and other drugs is another purpose of the course, to 
be held in Mexico City's Independence Auditorium. 
  The official spokesman for the Attorney General's Office, 
Fernando Aguilar, remarked that the meeting would be opened by 
the assistant prosecutor for preliminary investigations, Rene 
Gonzalez de la Vega. It will be organized by that institution's 
General Directorate of Expert Services as well. 
  He indicated that, during the sessions, both national and 
foreign experts will relate their experiences with the use of 
reagents and high technology procedures as aids in the 
investigations conducted by the Federal Public Prosecutor's 
Office. The aim is to achieve a better and more expeditious 
prosecution and administration of justice. 
  He explained that, at the first session, on 25 April, the 
specialists will discuss topics relating to the organization of 
narcotics laboratories in France and Mexico, and the program for 
regionalizing such laboratories, as well as the national dating 
of drugs in France. They will also deal with problems involving 
the international legislation on chemical precursors. 
  There will be subsequent discussions on the identification 
of 
marijuana based on its botanical characteristics, color 
reactions, and chromatography techniques, as well as the 
identification of its origin. Also to be covered are 
hallucinogenic mushrooms and their active principles; cocaine 
and its botanical characteristics, origin, and identification 
with various chemical reagents; and precursors and analogous 
drug substances. 
  Other topics dealt with will be the identification of 
Papaveracea [the poppy family]; opium and its derivatives; and 
the analysis of its principal adulterants, derivatives, 
intermediate products, and precursors. Before the forum 
concludes, speakers will discuss the classification of 
psychotropics, pharmacological activity and the General Health 
Law, and the identification of amphetamines and their 
derivatives, barbiturates, and hypnotic substances. Finally, 
there will be a general explanation of the amendments to the 
Penal Code relating to this subject.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on drug seizures and arrests related to drug trafficking 
monitored through 19 May. 
<H5>  Argentina </H5>
  On 12 May police personnel arrested two men carrying 6,000 
doses of LSD during a control operation at Ezeiza international 
airport. The drugs were hidden in 11 tablets distributed in 
small bags. This is the largest LSD seizure ever in Argentina. 
(Buenos Aires PAGINA/12 in Spanish 14 May 94 p 15) 
<H5>  Bolivia </H5>
  Lieutenant Colonel Ramiro Ortega Sequeiros, Mobil Rural 
Patrol Unit, Umopar, commander in Beni Department, reported on 4 
May that four people, including two alleged drug traffickers who 
are sought by the antidrug police, died on 29 April in the crash 
of a small plane. The accident occurred at the Loma Alta cattle 
ranch, northeast of San Joaquin in Mamore Province. The crew 
members were identified as pilot Erwin Revollo; Sergio Garcia, 
aka Pedro Combo; German Arias Rodriguez, aka Tres Patas; and his 
wife Rosa Antelo Suarez. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 7 May 94 
Section 2 p 3) 
  The Umopar commander in Beni, Ramiro Ortega, reported that 
an 
operation conducted in the township of La Orquilla, Itenez 
Province, Beni Department, showed that petty drug traffickers 
are gradually replacing the small light planes that carried the 
drugs from the Chapare region to the drug gathering centers in 
Beni and Pando Departments. They travel through forests and 
rivers that are not under rigorous control to the drug gathering 
centers, where they contact the buyers. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in 
Spanish 9 May 94 National Section p 1) 
  During an operation carried out last weekend in Oruro by 
members of the Special Antinarcotics Force, a total of 42 kg of 
cocaine paste were confiscated when a group of drug traffickers 
riding in a truck were intercepted on the Oruro-Pisagas highway 
on the Chilean border. As a result six drug traffickers were 
arrested. (La Paz Television Nacional in Spanish 0100 GMT 18 
May 94) 
<H5>  Brazil </H5>
  The largest opium byproduct seizure ever made in Brazil has 
allowed the federal police to discover a new international drug 
trafficking route. U.S. citizen Lisa Ruth Bell was arrested at 
Rio de Janeiro international airport carrying 12 kg of opium 
byproducts valued at $12 million. The drugs were hidden under 
the false bottom in her handbag and in bags tied to her body. 
The police have discovered that traffickers are using direct 
Bangkok-Rio de Janeiro flights to bring in the drugs, which are 
then shipped to the United States. Federal police specialists 
are analyzing the seizure to ascertain whether it involves 
heroin or morphine. (Rio de Janeiro Rede Globo Television in 
Portuguese 1600 GMT 17 May 94) 
<H5>  Paraguay </H5>
  National Narcotics Directorate personnel arrested two 
Brazilian citizens and seized more than 2 kg of very pure 
cocaine during a raid of an inn in the township of San Lorenzo. 
The detainees are Enrique Cespedes Leiges, 34, and Edson 
Pereira da Silva, 39. (Asuncion ABC COLOR in Spanish 13 May 94 p

  [Text] Latin American representatives fear drug trafficking 
groups may be behind the international campaign to decriminalize 
and legalize narcotics. 
  "They use well-known international personalities to promote 
legalization," said lawyer Rodolfo Vielmann, 55, general 
coordinator of the Drug Prevention Council of Guatemala. 
  The concern with the decriminalization of drugs was 
expressed 
on 13 May in Sao Paulo during the last day of a meeting of Latin 
American drug prevention experts. 
  The forum was sponsored by the UN International Drug Control 
Program (UNDCP) and 40 experts from 17 countries participated. 
  Some participants suggested holding another UN meeting to 
exclusively discuss the subject of decriminalization. 
  Vielmann said some members of the U.S. Health Department 
defend the idea. In Colombia, some court sentences have 
considered the use of drugs a personal matter and an individual 
right. 
  "The court decisions of some countries worry us," said one 
participant who did not want to be identified. "Traffickers 
kill," he added. 
  Psychologist Jose Luis Harb, 34, the Bolivian Social 
Prevention under secretary, said the preaching in favor of 
decriminalization in Colombia is worrisome. 
  He said that Bolivia is a drug producing country and this 
makes it different from the rest. "In my country cocaine base is 
very cheap and traffickers are interested in the foreign market. 
To decriminalize narcotics does not help at all." 
  Luis Carlos Zamora Reys, 37, the head of the Colombian 
National Narcotics Directorate, said that legislation in his 
country only tolerates drug addicts and worries with their 
recovery. 
  Sao Paulo First Lady Ika Fleury said: "The idea of 
decriminalizing narcotics is globally flourishing," adding: "If 
badly conducted, it will have serious consequences." She 
participated in the UNDCP closing ceremony as president of the 
Sao Paulo Solidarity and Social Fund. 
  Giovanni Quaglia, 43, UNDCP director in Brazil, said the 
legalization of drugs "is no solution, it is beginning to be 
defended because society believes all other measures have 
failed." 
  He said that what is happening in some Latin American 
countries is a trend to decriminalize consumers and those who 
carry small amounts.

  [Text] Expressing his agreement with an opinion voiced by 
U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia Charles Bowers, Social Defense 
National Secretary Mario Soliz noted that so far Law 1008 has 
achieved good results and met its goal of struggling against 
drug trafficking. 
  Soliz was referring to remarks made in Sucre by U.S. 
Ambassador Charles Bowers, who noted that Law 1008 is a "fair 
and good" instrument. 
  At odds with the citizenry's nearly unanimous position that 
this law should be changed, Ambassador Bowers prefers the 
implementation of the law to remain unchanged. 
  For his part, Mario Soliz emphasized that Law 1008 has met 
its goal and become a key element in the war being waged against 
the scourge of drug trafficking. 
  Nevertheless, Soliz indicated that now it is necessary "to 
improve" this legal instrument through a total consensus 
involving all social groups of the population. 
  Soliz added that this improvement is closely linked to the 
amendments that might be implemented, based on the experiences 
gathered so far. 
  Asked about the possible approval of a decree regulating the 
legal marketing and industrialization of coca leaves, Soliz said 
he is satisfied because this government measure will benefit 
coca producers. 
  Soliz added: "This is a good regulation that approves coca 
industrialization only in areas that traditionally have produced 
it."

  [Text] A high-level source in the multiethnic army of Chang 
Sifu or "Khun Sa" denied a report on the recapture of several 
towns on the western bank of the Salween River by Rangoon 
government troops. 
  The source confirmed that Khun Sa's soldiers are still in 
full control of all strongholds, noting that the report on the 
recapture of towns from Khun Sa's army was merely propaganda 
from the Burmese Government. He admitted that goverment troops 
are present in the region, but they have not yet launched any 
offensive against Khun Sa's positions. 
  Both the government's side and Khun Sa's army suffered heavy 
casualties in the fighting, which broke out opposite Lak Taeng 
village of Wiang Haeng District, Chiang Mai Province, since 7 
May. It was reported that the Burmese Government has recaptured 
eight strongholds earlier taken over by Khun Sa's men. On 20 
May, some 7,000 government soldiers, together with 1,200 
porters, were reportedly rallying in the vicinities of Mong Chot 
and Mong Tuan in preparation for crossing the Salween River to 
the western bank to launch attacks on Khun Sa's positions. 
  The source said he was unaware of the report on the U.S. 
financial assistance given to the Burmese Government for the 
suppression operations against ethnic rebel groups, adding that 
the Burmese Government probably cited narcotics problem as a 
pretext to request the U.S. help. 
  Our correspondent reported that although the fighting was 18 
kilometers away, the sound of artillery shelling could be 
clearly heard in Wiang Haeng district town. No wounded soldiers 
from Khun Sa's army crossed the border to seek treatment from 
Wiang Haeng district's hospital as in the past because Khun Sa 
has set up field hospitals at the strongholds captured earlier 
from the government side. 
  District Clerk Phongsakon Thirabadi said he had instructed 
officials to closely monitor the situation along the border with 
Burma. However, he anticipated gruesome battles if the 
government troops are able to cross the Salween River to the 
western side, and this can trigger refugee influx into Thailand.

  [Text] La Paz, 10 May -- The ministers of foreign affairs 
and of government agree over the legalization of drugs. 
Responding to whether Bolivia will follow Colombia's lead with 
regard to the legalization of drug consumption, they stated on 
10 May that this issue cannot--and should not--be considered 
from a unilateral standpoint, but rather as a part of a general 
context. The government rejects this because it wants to 
prevent the country from becoming a "Mecca" for drug traffickers. 
  Both ministers seek to ward off the possibility that Bolivia 
will embark on a legalization process, since--as Government 
Minister German Quiroga pointed out--it would turn the country 
into a "Mecca for drug trafficking." 
  Quiroga said: "The trafficking issue must be assessed within 
a general perspective rather than individually, as a nation. It 
would be terribly dangerous if one country became the 
traffickers Mecca. This is why we must be part of a general 
approach, part of the measures adopted by all countries--both 
producers and consumers." 
  Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar termed the issue delicate 
and pointed out that it must be solved by the international 
community as a whole, as the community of nations is now 
debating this issue. 
  The government minister--who holds more radical 
ideas--voiced 
his firm opposition to the decriminalization of cocaine as 
Colombia proposed. He believes it would turn the country into 
the "Mecca" for the production, consumption, and peddling of 
psychotropic drugs and a place where drug kingpins would thrive. 
  Quiroga pointed out that the legalization of consumption 
should be part of a consensus process and policy among several 
countries. He added that it would be most inappropriate for 
Bolivia to make a unilateral decision. 
  He stated that Colombia's stance on this issue should be 
considered as "leaving one's opponent unmarked and making a 
false move" which may have appalling consequences for that Latin 
American country which may become the world's center of drug 
consumption and distribution. He added: "This is most 
dangerous." 
  Quiroga noted that one cannot favor the legalization of 
drugs 
on the premise that interdiction has allegedly failed, since the 
two points are different, but at the same time are constituent 
parts of a whole. Interdiction is a fundamental part that seeks 
to track and punish traffickers while crop substitution programs 
seek to devise economic solutions to solve the problem of 
surplus coca production. 
  "The two paths should run parallel: Interdiction should not 
be conducted without crop substitution, nor should the latter 
take place without drug enforcement. The two should be part of 
an overall policy," he said. 
  Quiroga said Bolivia should coordinate with other countries 
toward a coordinated action. 
  The government minister remarked that the country has 
achieved very encouraging results in its struggle against 
trafficking, even though it did not eradicate all surplus coca 
plantations. He added that this subject is under discussion 
with U.S. authorities. 
  Quiroga contended that aid for the balance of payments 
should 
not be exclusively linked to the reduction of coca crops, but 
should also consider blows dealt to trafficking, the destruction 
of maceration pits, the dismantling of laboratories, and the 
number of drug gangs arrested. 
  He said: "It is not just a question of destroying coca 
crops, 
it is a war against trafficking." Quiroga also denied any 
alleged pressure over the mandatory eradication of surplus 
plantations and a reduction in economic aid toward the balance 
of payments.

  [Excerpts] Military troops are patrolling Chapare Region. 
This was confirmed by Social Defense Under Secretary Mario 
Soliz. He stated, however, that the military troops are not 
involved in the struggle against drug trafficking. 
  [Begin Soliz recording] Right now military troops, like any 
ordinary citizens, are circulating in the Chapare zone, and some 
of them are carrying out training exercises. They are also 
investigating the possible existence of narcoterrorism. [end 
recording] 
  Soliz commented that the troops in El Chapare are subject to 
the Defense Ministry, and not to the Social Defense 
Undersecretariat. 
  The under secretary said that many peasants oppose the 
presence of the Leopardos [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas, 
UMOPAR] because they are involved in drug trafficking. 
  [Begin Soliz recording] The operation Amanecer [Dawn] was 
carried out in Sinahota, and within 2 hours some 6 kg of cocaine 
were seized. Moreover, 45 maceration pits and 32 cocaine 
factories were found during the course of the day. This is 
really frightening, because the average number of maceration 
pits UMOPAR members usually find ranges from six to eight per 
day. [end recording] 
  Recently the government approved a decree referring to the 
industrialization of coca leaf, which was not welcomed by the 
leaders of the coca farmers. 
  [Begin Soliz recording] There is a surplus coca leaf 
production that is illegal; these are illegal plantations. The 
government can therefore by no means authorize the 
industrialization of something that is illegal, as this would be 
illogical; it would mean violating laws and, I repeat, this 
makes no sense. [passage omitted] 
  Mario Soliz asserted that the mentioned decree cannot be 
modified as the Chapare leaders have requested. 
  In turn, he asked them to fulfill the commitment to 
voluntarily eradicate part of the surplus production. 
  [Begin Soliz recording] What we want to say to them, in the 
first place, is: Gentlemen, let us eradicate 3,000 hectares, 
because if we do so the country will receive $20 million which 
it needs. We are not talking about compulsory eradication. The 
law clearly states that we must eradicate between 5,000 and 
8,000 hectares. But we want to reach a consensus. [end 
recording] 
  Soliz then said that with or without a consensus, the 
alternative development plans and the voluntary eradication of 
coca plantations will in any case be implemented in Chapare. 
  [Begin Soliz recording] We do not want to resort to violence 
because, after all, the government has the necessary tools to 
see to it that the law is respected, but we believe that 
interdiction is not the best alternative at this moment if we 
are able to reach a consensus. [end recording]

  [Text] The executive branch believes that 80 to 90 percent 
of the coca leaf produced in Chapare is earmarked for drug 
trafficking. Minister German Quiroga stated that it has 
therefore been decided to regulate the use of coca leaf through 
a supreme decree. Quiroga, however, issued some warnings. 
  [Begin Quiroga recording] The decree states in what zone of 
the country this regulation regarding the industrialization of 
coca leaf should be implemented. We were under the impression 
that some coca farmers wanted to decriminalize coca production, 
but the government has no intention of doing that as the entire 
country is aware that approximately 80 or maybe 90 percent of 
the surplus coca leaf produced in Chapare is earmarked for drug 
trafficking. [end recording] 
  Minister Quiroga made a clear comparison. He said that on 
one hand there is the good coca, which is used for chewing and 
for industrial purposes, and on the other there is the bad coca, 
and we must not forget that. The bad coca is essentially that 
produced in Chapare which, in turn, is used to produce cocaine. 
  Nobody should therefore have any illusions that coca is 
going 
to freely circulate in Bolivia. That would be like giving 
cocaine carte blanche.

  [Excerpt] Rio de Janeiro -- On the evening of 12 May, 
Federal Police [PF] Drug Enforcement Division agents seized a 
truck that was carrying with 300 kg of marijuana and at least 60 
boxes of .45 and .357 Magnum ammunition. The incident took 
place on the Rio de Janeiro-Sao Paulo road, near Nova Iguazu, 
(Baixada Fluminense District). 
  The cargo was found in the double bottom of a dump truck 
with 
Sao Paulo license plates BWD-1230, which was being carried on a 
car transporter to Rio de Janeiro. The car transporter driver, 
Miguel Dias Ribeiro, said he was hired to transport the dump 
truck. He denied all knowledge of the drugs. 
  Police officer Ramon Alonso headed the operation. He said 
the drugs were found following the arrest in Sao Paulo of 
trafficker Claudeci Martineli da Silva who was carrying 86 kg of 
pure cocaine which he was about to send to Rio de Janeiro. 
Martineli allegedly informed the PF of the drug shipment. 
Alonso did not want to give details about where it was supposed 
to be delivered. The driver, who was arrested, said that he had 
to meet someone in Rio de Janeiro who would take the dump truck.

<F P=106> [From the "Midday Television Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The Constitutional Court today upheld the ruling on 
personal drug consumption. The ruling will not affect the 
sentences of those who store, produce, manufacture, distribute, 
or are linked in any other way to drug trafficking activities. 
Fernando Ramos has the story: [begin recording] 
  Ramos: As for the ruling that authorized 
possession of drugs for personal use, the Constitutional Court 
emphasized we cannot think of repression as the only mechanism 
to solve this problem. In several of the ruling's paragraphs, 
the Constitutional Court insisted it ruled according to what the 
Constitution and the laws stipulate. 
  Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango: This 
is nothing unusal; it complies with the duties of the 
Constitutional Court. As for the consumption of potentially 
toxic substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, we count 
on education, which is part of the ruling. 
  Ramos: The ruling also stipulates that the 
National Congress will be able to legislate to find measures to 
control drug consumption. 
  Constitutional Court Magistrate Vladimiro Naranjo: 
Within the Legislative Branch, the National Congress is free to 
take the initiative in this field. There are no reasons why the 
Constitutional Court has to set some standards; this is a 
legislative initiative. 
  Ramos: The four dissenting votes were also 
submitted to the Constitutional Court Secretariat General. The 
reasons why some magistrates voted against the legalization of 
drugs for personal use are explained in those documents. 
  Constitutional Court Magistrate Hernando Herrera: 
I believe the right to free personality development cannot 
overstep the rights of society, family, youth, children, and 
women, because our Constitution stipulates the prevalence of 
general interest over individual rights. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Statement issued on behalf of the Colombian Constitutional </F>
Court by Court President Jorge Arango Mejia in Santa Fe de 
Bogota on 18 May] 
  [Text] Statement from the president of the Constitutional 
Court, as spokesman for the Court: 
  1. As a lawyer and a judge, I refuse to issue in haste an 
opinion on the varied and complex judicial issues raised by the 
president of the Republic in his 18 May (17 May) statements. It 
is necessary to study them thoroughly. 
  In addition, as president of the Constitutional Court, I am 
forbidden from engaging in controversies surrounding the Court's 
decisions, regardless of whether a citizen or the chief of the 
Executive Branch himself starts them. 
  2. The Constitutional Court's decisions, arrived at through 
a majority vote, are the decisions of the institution, not just 
the decisions of those who voted in favor of a decision, because 
neither the Constitution nor the law requires unanimity. This 
is why the attempt to create divisions and dissension over the 
Court's vote is inadmissible. There is only one Constitutional 
Court. 
  3. The Constitution stipulates the separation of government 
branches. Thus anything that entails interference by one branch 
in the inherent functions of another contravenes the 
Constitution itself. We will have to determine to what extent 
the president of the Republic's disapproval of the 
Constitutional Court's decision respects the Court's autonomy, 
complies with the constitutional mandate established for 
harmonious collaboration among government branches, and 
contributes to institutions' normal procedures. 
  4. The Constitutional Court has ruled and will continue to 
rule with resolute autonomy, thereby fulfilling its duty to 
safeguard the integrity and preponderance of the Constitution as 
stipulated in Article 214. The Court must always remain 
detached from pressure and flattery, regardless of who exerts 
the former and who utters the latter. 
  Finally, the public must understand that when the 
Constitutional Court issues a decision, it does so to meet its 
exclusive commitments without the need for or opportunity to 
consult anyone or anything other than the Constitution. 
  [Dated] Santa Fe de Bogota. 18 May 1994 
  [Signed] Jorge Arango Mejia.

<F P=106> [Text of government communique issued in Santa Fe de Bogota </F>
on 18 May] 
  [Text] Aware of the reasons which led the Constitutional 
Court to declare unconstitutional provisions which penalize the 
possession and consumption of personal doses of drugs, the 
national government reasserts that it will obey the judicial 
decision. Not only does the government not agree with the 
decision, it believes that its effect will be serious. 
Consumption of substances that create addiction cannot be part 
of the behavior condoned as part of the free development of 
personality. Legislators must be given the option to ban and 
punish this, according to his criteria. 
  The government does not share the court's extremely 
individualistic interpretation of the Constitution in matters 
related not only to individual autonomy but also to obligations 
established in the Constitution, in this case Articles 49 and 95. 
  The government considers it its duty to promote the 
necessary 
decisions to fill the void and mistakes that might result from 
the court's decision. Immediately, using authority derived from 
laws now in effect, the government will issue decrees to 
prohibit and to confirm prohibitions on the possession and 
consumption of drugs and psychotropic and hallucinatory 
substances in at least the following places and events: public 
places, places open to the public, schools, and workplaces. 
Drugs will be banned among minors, pregnant women; drivers of 
vehicles, ships, or airplanes; those who bear firearms; and 
those who exercise certain professions, such as doctors and 
dentists. 
  Likewise, we intend to establish penalties for violations of 
some of the preceding prohibitions, according to each case and 
the seriousness of the misdemeanor. The penalties will range 
from arrest, closure of public places, suspension of flight 
licenses, cancellation of work contracts, suspension or firing 
of public workers, deportation of foreigners, cancellation of 
firearm permits, and the suspension of licenses or professional 
cards. 
  The government reiterates that topics of such importance 
must 
take into account what the people have to say, thus the 
government calls on all Colombian society--political parties, 
churches, economic associations, workers, peasants, social and 
community organizations, the academic community, parents and 
youths--to present together with the government a draft bill 
with popular initiative, to call a referendum to modify the 
Constitution to clearly establish the prevalence of the general 
interest, the possibility of penalizing citizens for not 
fulfilling their duties, and clearly stating the legislators' 
prerogative to ban and prohibit the consumption of drugs and 
psychotropic substances. 
  In the next few weeks the president will call on 
representatives of the various mentioned institutions and 
organizations to form promotional committees and begin the 
necessary formalities for a popular legislative initiative. 
Given the reaction in the last few days, the national 
government is certain that is correctly interpreting the 
feelings of all Colombians in support of the fight against drug 
trafficking and preventing youths from Colombia and the rest of 
the world from falling into the claws of today's most damaging 
perversity--drug consumption.

perversity--drug consumption. 
  I am ready for your questions. 
  Moderator: First we have Azucena Lievano from the 
"24 Hours Newscast." We ask that reporters ask only one 
question because we have a time limit. 
  Lievano: Mr. President, in the court's decision 
the magistrates also spoke of the need for the state to 
establish measures or ways to educate Colombians on this. What 
decisions will the government make to teach people not to take 
drugs? 
  Gaviria: My suggestion was against the emotional 
part of the ruling, about which the government is very 
concerned. If the government accepts the emotional part of the 
Constitutional Court's ruling, this would mean that because 
citizens have a right to take drugs, campaigns against drug 
consumption themselves could be called into question at any 
time. In fact, if the emotional part of the sentence were 
accepted, it could serve as a basis for the judge to rule in 
favor of a petition for protection and say that not even 
anti-drug campaigns are a legitimate civil right. 
  The government is very, very concerned about the effects of 
the Constitutional Court's decision. But it is even more 
concerned about what motivated this sentence that made drug 
consumption into a civil right. This is very risky for society. 
It endangers the very campaigns that society, other 
institutions, and the government are waging in an attempt to 
convince Colombians, especially the younger generation, not to 
take drugs. This is because of the enormous risk this poses to 
an individual's development and to peaceful coexistence. The 
effect this has had in developing a society with healthy 
citizens, forming healthy citizens, and not citizens who are 
addicts, not persons with habits [words indistinct] that the 
justices of the Constitutional Court have now considered as a 
personal right. This will cause great harm to individuals and 
society. 
  Moderator: Diana Mateu, from Radio Santa Fe. 
  Mateu: Good afternoon Mr. President. Some nations 
have criticized Colombia's position on drug consumption as it 
seems to change so much. There is also the confrontation 
between powers that seems to favor a trend toward the 
decriminalization of drugs, something that the government of 
course opposes. Do you think that this could have repercussions 
on future relations with the United States? 
  Gaviria: I believe this is basically an internal 
problem. I have never seen it as a problem with the 
international community; I have viewed it as a matter that 
concerns Colombians alone. I have been witness to the Colombian 
community's almost unanimous reaction against the possibility 
that in Colombia drugs could be used freely. What is more, that 
decision almost exalts drug consumption; it is full 
justification for citizens to take drugs. This terrifies us. I 
do not believe one must [word indistinct] or tolerate 
international implications. 
  Let me take this opportunity to indicate that in other 
nations where [words indistinct] to say that drug consumption 
has been depenalized, let me say that in no country has this 
become a civil right. It is as if a specific antisocial 
behavior is considered [words indistinct] without the need to 
[words indistinct] that conduct of a penal nature. It is to 
that extent that there has been certain tolerance for accepting 
personal doses for drug consumption. It has not occurred to 
anyone to make this a civil right. [words indistinct] 
anti-social behavior. Right now, in no nation in the world, 
with the exception of Colombia, is drug consumption considered 
normal conduct or as an aspect of the development of an 
individual's personality. No, not at all. In all the nations 
of the world, drug consumption is a considered antisocial 
behavior. In some nations, in the vast majority, this incurs 
penal sanctions. There are some nations where there are no penal 
sanctions, but drug consumption is considered antisocial 
behavior, a behavior that should be dealt with as a health 
problem. [Words indistinct] civilian sector favors not 
penalizing drug consumption, but it is something totally 
different to turn drug consumption into a civil right. 
  Moderator: Question from Flora Ines Torres. 
  Torres: Good afternoon, Mr. President. Aren't you 
playing your last card by calling for a referendum this close to 
the end of your administration? In addition, you need the votes 
of 5 million Colombians. What is your opinion? 
  Gaviria: I am acting in accordance with my duties. 
[Words indistinct] with my political nature. I believe I am 
behaving as most Colombians expect me to. We would have wanted 
to hold this referendum sooner. Due to the ruling's character, 
we have determined that most of the--should we say--limitations 
that could be established could be done by decree. However, to 
avert the constitutional consequences and to try to avoid having 
this type of interpretation of the Constitution prevail, we have 
to modify the Constitution. 
  We believe the law that will be proposed to Congress on 
holding a referendum should come from a popular initiative, and 
we hope, in the coming days, to form a group to follow all 
procedures regarding the law on mechanisms for participation 
that will be sanctioned next week. We are only waiting for the 
signatures of some congressional chamber presidents because, as 
the Constitutional Court stipulates, Congress establishes the 
requirement that a popular initiative law [ley de iniciativa 
popular] must call a referendum. 
  I would also like to point out that, based on our 
consultations, our interpretation of the Constitution, and the 
law on mechanisms for participation, our opinion is that this 
referendum cannot take place concurrently with an election. It 
could not be held either during the first elections, the runoff 
elections, or possibly in the upcoming October elections. That 
referendum would have to be held on a separate date. We have 
not set a date for referendum nor have we agreed on its content 
because we want to reach a consensus with the sectors that come 
with us to collect the signatures. We want to get back on 
course and present this to the Congress during its regular 
sessions in June or in the sessions that are to start on 20 July. 
  We believe it would not be appropriate to present it before 
the law on mechanisms for participation is passed, or before 
hearing the views of the other sectors on which we have called. 
We will begin consultations next week in order to form a group 
of people to negotiate a popular intiative law with the 
Congress. I am positive we will be able to gather the 800,000 
signatures required to make this a popular initiative law. I 
have confidence we will collect several million signatures for 
Congress so that it becomes aware of what Colombians want. 
  Moderator: Here is William Parra. 
  Parra: Mr. President, why hadn't we heard until 
now about the government's reaction to this Constitutional Court 
decision? Why didn't the government respond while the suit was 
pending? What justification can President Gaviria give 
Colombians when he strongly promoted the Constitution and now he 
wants to reform it? As the Constitutional Court president said 
yesterday, it's like having a new dress and changing it [words 
indistinct] three months later. 
  Gaviria: First, I believe you did not listen to 
the statement I made the day after the Court's decision. I 
believe Colombians are clear on the fact that their government 
and their president reacted to the Court's decision. I do not 
believe my statement today is any different from the one I made 
at that time [two-minute break in reception] that our 
Constitution embraces fundamental rights, which have no 
limitations and must not be compared to these other rights. 
  This is somehow what is behind the Constitutional Court's 
decision [word indistinct] because obviously that was not the 
feeling of the four magistrates who cast a dissenting vote, thus 
responding to the arguments and motivations with which the 
majority of Constitutional Court magistrates reached this 
decision. 
  Moderator: The next question is from Ricaro Canon 
from "The Noon" newscast. After that will be Jairo Gomez. 
  Canon: Mr. President, as long as this decision is 
in effect, what position and actions will the government adopt 
to repress and penalize drug consumption and trafficking? Do 
you consider, as you pointed out, that the Constitutional 
Court's decision can be overturned by decree? 
  Gaviria: No. No. We cannot overturn the Court's 
ruling by issuing a decree, because it will violate the 
Constitution. Because the ruling has a paragraph that includes 
the same guidelines, decrees, and laws of previous police corps, 
we will establish some of the limitations that the Court 
believes are reasonable and could be established. However, the 
essence of the ruling, drug consumption in Colombia, will not be 
banned. This is a basic right that cannot be curtailed by 
issuing a decree. The only way we can curtail that right, 
should we want to, is to amend our Constitution by means of 
following the amendment procedures stipulated in the 
Constitution itself. 
  Moderator: Next question is by Jairo Gomez from 
the "Seven O'Clock Newscast", followed by Antonio Jose Caballero. 
  Gomez: Mr. President, according to the proposal 
you have just made, there will undoubtedly be need for many 
steps, and most surely it will not be taken into account before 
your administration ends on 7 August. Why did you not leave 
this to the new president of the Republic? 
  Gaviria: Well, for one thing, the new president 
of the Republic would have proceeded with this issue as he saw 
fit. I do not want to get involved in the decisions the new 
president would adopt. I am going to issue the decree and take 
the initiative in asking citizens to express their opinions. I 
believe that it was not only the president's opinion which I 
expressed in the early hours of the day after the Court's 
decision. In this respect, with regard to the next government, 
he will proceed as he deems appropiate. I believe that as a 
result of the generalized frame of mind of the Colombian people 
with respect to this issue, the next president's government will 
work to have the people express an opinion on this issue. If we 
had had a president-elect now I could have consulted on the 
issue with him. Since we don't, I believe it is my 
responsibility to uphold the Colombian people's desire to keep 
working to prevent this situation--which is of a legal 
nature--from taking hold. This is the case not only because of 
what it represents, as far as drug consumption goes, which a 
great majority of Colombians reject, but also for other reasons 
that could become a reality if this type of decision prevails in 
Colombian society as an interpretation of the Constitution. 
  Moderator: Here is Antonio Jose Caballero of RCN, 
and (Clemente Dominguez) gets ready to ask his question. 
  Caballero: Mr. President, once again we hear the 
expression I abide by but do not agree with in this explanation 
of the Colombian state branches. The prosecutor general [words 
indistinct] through the Constitutional Court. What is the 
government most concerned about? The image of Colombians abroad 
or the health and well-being of people here? 
  Gaviria: With regard to what the prosecutor 
general thinks of the Constitutional Court's decision, that is 
something you would have to ask him, whether this was the sort 
of legalization he was proposing or something different, or 
whether he had another proposal to make to Colombia and the 
international community. I would prefer not to interpret the 
prosecutor general's view. I have clearly stated that I am 
concerned about this situation's impact at home, not for its 
impact abroad. I am fundamentally concerned about its impact at 
home on the health of Colombians, the social cohesion of 
Colombians, the need to punish the antisocial behavior in 
Colombian society. It concerns me whether it is advisable for 
Colombian society to be able to demand that drug abusers undergo 
medical treatment so that Colombian society can punish anyone 
who is a repeat drug abuser if he does not undergo medical 
treatment and give up drugs. These circumstances make this a 
serious matter. 
  Reaction abroad does not seem essential to me. Reaction of 
citizens, parents and young people, reflects concern for our 
children, our young people, and our society. I have not seen 
anyone worry about the consequences abroad. In fact, I do not 
think there will be consequences abroad. We have to focus on 
the impact this has on our families, our children, and our 
society. 
  Moderator: Here to ask a question is (Clemente 
Dominguez) of Todelar. Samuel Salazar of Caracol Radio gets 
ready to ask his question. 
  Dominguez: Mr. President, why do you insist on a 
referendum rather than on a bill, as the Constitutional Court 
said, and why not include the proposal for an educational 
campaign for drug abusers since experts feel drug addiction is a 
kind of illness? 
  Gaviria: Regarding the first issue, I would like 
to say the decree we will issue will in no way take the place of 
a statutory law that establishes limitations mentioned by the 
Court's decision. The Court said these are police norms, and we 
believe that by gathering a large amount of norms from the 
Minors Code and other kinds of legislation to which we will 
refer next when we will issue the decree we will be able to 
establish those limitations. But we are concerned about the 
motivation behind the sentence, not so much about the decision 
that we can criminalize [as heard] drug consumption, since what 
concerns me the most is motivation. 
  Why are we concerned about motivation, and why do I insist 
on 
this? We are concerned about motivation because it has turned 
drug consumption not into antisocial behavior that will not be 
penalized but into a civil right. These are two very different 
things. It is true that some societies have come to the 
conclusion that they do not want to penalize drug consumption or 
the personal drug doses. No society, however, has said that drug 
consumption is not antisocial conduct. This is something 
exclusive to Colombian society and our Constitutional Court. 
Holland, Germany, Italy, (Spain), and some U.S. states did not 
do this. That is not true. Drug consumption in all those 
countries is antisocial conduct. It is antisocial conduct. In 
some countries it is punished by law, and in others it is not, 
but in all of them it is antisocial behavior. But here, our 
Court, in an interpreation that we described as excessively 
individualistic, has ruled that drug consumption is not 
antisocial behavior but actually a right. I think it does 
serious harm to Colombian society to coexist with that theory, 
with that underlying idea of the development of personality, 
which deep down... [pauses] In some way we agree with the 
dissenting opinion that showed this undermines life and the very 
argument used by the Court. It undermines human dignity, the 
development of personality, and social coexistence. 
  Moderator: Here to ask a question is Samuel 
Salazar of Caracol Radio, and Pablo Arturo Paez gets ready. 
  Salazar: [Words indistinct] [Ninenteen-second 
break in reception for station identification by station 
announcer] 
  Gaviria: ...an arbitrary arrest. We could decide 
to arrest a driver for having taken drugs. We believe that this 
conduct is evidently damaging to society. In addition, we would 
have to consider other than simple penalties. We believe such 
conduct warrants an arrest and our Constitution foresees it 
[words indistinct] not been declared as invalid by the Court. 
We believe that anyone who takes drugs in public places can be 
subject to arrest, more so if we are referring to any Public 
Force member. Quite frankly speaking, I plan to fight with all 
my energy to prevent Colombian society from falling prey to 
situations where, for example, Public Force members or even 
doctors, take drugs right in front of their patients, or perform 
surgery while under the influence of drugs. I firmly believe 
that such conduct warrants an arrest. Don't you agree? 
  Moderator: The following question is from Carlos 
Arturo Paez from [word indistinct] followed by Ana Fernanda 
Valderrama. 
  Paez: Mr. President, the Constitutional Court's 
majority decision was made by taking Article 16 of the 
Constitution into consideration. When reading this article we 
notice that this article is very broad and difficult to 
regulate. Does the government have its own initiative as to 
what and how this article should be regulated? 
  Gaviria: Most surely it is an article very 
difficult to regulate. Except for cases involving drug 
consumption, we have found no other angle to develop the article 
as part of a statutory law. We have thought--and this would be 
one of the issues we would propose to the group working on the 
People's Initiative Law--to include a proposal to add several 
paragraphs to the article establishing that the lawmaker can 
determine penalties, inclusive of criminal penalties, not only 
against those who take drugs under certain circumstances such as 
the ones I just mentioned. Most of all to determine penalties 
even for those who take drugs on a personal basis. 
  Moderator: Last question from Ana Fernanda 
Valderrama from "National Newscast." 
  Valderrama: Mr. President, good afternoon. 
Through a decree you plan to tell the Colombian people, as well 
as the country's mayors, that they are not allowed to take drugs 
in public places. You plan to tell doctors that they cannot do 
it in front of their patients. However, what everyone is 
wondering is that most surely the people are going to do it in 
private and it is not going to be restricted to the average 
citizen, but it will also spread, even government workers. 
Don't you believe that this could foment the double morality 
standards already existing in the country? 
  Gaviria: Of course, however, that is not as result 
of the decree the government is going to issue. It is a 
repercussion of the ruling by the Constitutional Court. I think 
we all agree, and I think that on this the Constitutional Court 
also agrees, that Colombians have the right to consume drugs but 
that there must be limitations. Which limitations? There are 
limitations on situations that endanger social coexistence, 
solidarity, and social order. Those limitations will 
undoubtedly have to be established anyway. Just imagine a 
society that condones situations such as a pilot flying an 
aircraft, or a driver under the influence of drugs. Situations 
such as those represent a peril to social order. I feel 
obligated--regardless of the inconsistencies you just 
mentioned--to issue a decree that includes those legal 
provisions. Thank you all.

<F P=106> [Statement by Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate of the </F>
Colombian Conservative Party; place and date not given--live or 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Good afternoon. I am going to speak sincerely 
and directly, face to face with you, about the changes I will 
make if you elect me as your president on 29 May. I am going to 
tell you about my plans to make Colombia a nation of 
opportunities where we can be sure of getting a good education, 
being able to walk the streets safely, and finding a decent job. 
[passage omitted] 
  Previous governments have believed mistakenly that 
guerrillas 
and narcotraffickers are the only ones who deserve attention 
from the state, thus neglecting daily security. That is why I 
have proposed the creation of a specialized group, so that just 
as groups that counter guerrillas, kidnappings, and 
narcotrafficking, it can dedicate itself to dismantling and 
breaking up, once and for all, the mafia of common criminals who 
disrupt in the country's main cities and the tranquillity of 
citizens. 
  It is critical that we support the prosecutor general's work 
to definitively eliminate impunity. Nothing is more infuriating 
or frustrating than to see crimes go unpunished and criminals 
mocking their victims because they know they will not be 
punished. Even worse is the scenario where a victim, the 
citizen, is mistreated by a bureaucratized, inoperative, and 
inefficient justice system. For example, a citizen files 
charges and fails to recover stolen goods but must fear 
retribution from the thief he identified. We must guarantee 
citizens that they will receive prompt and full justice through 
fair punishment of the criminal. 
  Our personal safety is now jeopardized by the Constitutional 
Court's ruling on the legality of specific drug quantities for 
personal use. This is unacceptable and inconceivable. We 
cannot allow them to bury our dream of a better Colombia. As a 
parent, I cannot accept this and you can't either, because we 
want healthy children and young people. I do not want those who 
represent our future to fall under the effects of narcotics. I 
will not allow them to murder our future. I do not want to see 
the criminal selling drugs or killing our efforts to restore 
values, family, education, and everyday safety. No to drugs! I 
have always said this and will always say it: I will not budge! 
  I am not one of those who today says no to the court's 
decision but who yesterday was one of the ones who proposed 
legalization. Or maybe they believe that the marijuana of 15 
years ago was less harmful than the kind consumed in the streets 
today? What nonsense! No to drugs! Following the legalization 
of the personal dosage comes the legalization of drug 
trafficking. Make no mistake about that. In this struggle 
against the killers of our future, we have paid a high price in 
lives, kidnappings, and grief. That cost will not be fruitless. 
No parent who really loves his children, no teacher who values 
his students, no Colombian who thinks about Colombia can agree 
with those who favor legalization. I will not permit it.

  [Excerpt] Presidential candidate Andres Pastrana has said 
that truth must be the golden rule in politics as well as public 
administration and added that this principle, which should be 
part of this electoral campaign, has not been respected by all 
the presidential candidates. 
  Without naming names, but clearly alluding to them, Pastrana 
criticized Liberal candidates Ernesto Samper Pizano and Humberto 
de la Calle for their alleged sudden changes of opinion and 
attitude. 
  "One cannot trust someone who in June 1980 signed the ANIF 
[National Association of Financial Institutions] report 
supporting the legalization of marijuana and later reiterated 
this support at a meeting at the presidential palace on 13 May 
1993 and today changes his mind and rends his garments when what 
he so staunchly supported has been legalized," Pastrana said 
when referring to Samper. 
  "One cannot trust someone who today supports what he denied 
yesterday; one cannot trust someone who yesterday said `I will 
never accept' and today accepts it," Pastrana said in reference 
to De la Calle. 
  Pastrana spoke on Monday night at the Tequendama Hotel 
during 
an event to honor him sponsored by the Future Foundation. 
Several reporters were also invited to attend the event. 
  During his speech Pastrana insisted that his actions have 
been in accord with his way of thinking and that he is not lying 
to the country nor is he contradicting himself before the 
Colombian people. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Mexican Center for Children's Rights has 
reported that approximately a million children in the country 
between ages eight and 17 are inhaling solvents, and that there 
is no control over the sale of these products. 
  The foregoing is inferred from the study made by that 
center, 
titled "Inhalable Solvents and Child Drug Addiction," in which 
it also specifies that these substances are used primarily by 
street children. They are easily purchased in paint shops, or 
from shopping centers and street vending stands located in areas 
where those youngsters gather. 
  Thinner, resistol, glue, paints, and dyes, among other 
items, 
cost relatively little; hence, they have been called "cheap 
drugs." The price of any of these products ready for inhaling, 
and contained in bottles or plastic bags, is from five to 10 new 
pesos. 
  Based on reports from previous years, this center claimed 
that there is no effective control over the sale of these 
products. It indicated that even some members of police forces 
in Mexico City, and those in other countries, are profiting from 
this criminal business. 
  It comments: "In legal terms, inhalable solvents are not 
classified as drugs in Mexico, because they are industrial 
products manufactured, transported, and sold lawfully." Hence, 
the Penal Code does not categorize their sale for purposes other 
than those for which they were manufactured as a crime. 
  As for the damage caused by the inhalable substances, the 
report notes that it is known that recent studies with rats at 
the Mexican Institute of Pediatrics determined that toluene, a 
substance contained in all the products inhaled by children, 
damages the brain chemistry, reducing the response time in 
dangerous situations.

<F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina Cruz] </F>
  [Text] A large shipment of the synthetic drug known as 
"crystal," worth nearly $1 million on the drug black market in 
the United States, was seized by Federal Judicial Police [PJF] 
personnel assigned to Baja California State [BCS]. The PGR's 
[Attorney General's Office] branch agency in the state reported 
that, during the operation, three presumed drug traffickers were 
captured with the drug while attempting to reach the city of San 
Jose, in the state of California. 
  Information provided by the Federal Judicial Police General 
Directorate, headed by Commander Adrian Carrera Fuentes, reveals 
that members of the force succeeded in arresting three subjects 
identified as Xavier Madriz Hernandez and the sisters Maria and 
Veronica Rios Chacon. They were leaving the ferry Azteca, 
arriving from the port of Mazatlan, Sinaloa, at the Pichilingue 
marine terminal in La Paz. 
  Personnel under orders from the PJF deputy commissioner in 
the state, Manuel Ramirez Cardoso, began a routine inspection of 
the vehicle being driven by those now indicted: a 1987 Mazda 
pickup truck with Washington, D.C., plates No. 8574J1. Upon 
opening the vehicle's hood, they discovered a special 
compartment, especially designed to carry drugs and narcotics, 
in its lower part, directly below the windshield wiper area. 
  Inside the compartment the PJF agents found 13 packages of 
various sizes containing the narcotic, with a gross weight of 13 
kg and 700 grams. It was identified as "crystal," a drug known 
as one of the laboratory type, and highly toxic. 
  According to the statements made to the public prosecutor by 
the accused, entered in preliminary investigation 99/02/94, the 
presumed drug traffickers purchased the narcotic in the town of 
Tacapaltepec, Michoacan. They later moved it to the port of 
Mazatlan, where they boarded the ferry taking them to La Paz, 
Baja California Sur. They told the Federal Public Prosecutor's 
Office that they intended to travel by land from that area to 
the border at Tijuana, subsequently entering the town of San 
Jose, California. 
  In this connection, the PGR's representative in the state, 
Irma Garcia de Cuevas, stressed that "crystal," owing to its 
chemical composition per se, is a drug creating physical and 
psychological addiction from the first time that it is consumed. 
It also causes lack of appetite, hallucinations, and toxic 
psychosis. She concluded by noting that, had it reached its 
destination, it would have commanded a price of nearly $1 
million. Meanwhile, those now indicted will be placed at the 
disposal of the pertinent district judge of criminal 
proceedings. They will be tried based on their presumed guilt of 
committing crimes against health in the form of drug 
transportation and possession.

  [Text] On the morning of 17 May, Televisa Coahuila 
correspondent Juan Andres Martinez reported on "The Awakening 
Program" hosted by Guillermo Ortega that judicial agents protect 
drug traffickers in the city of Saltillo. As a result of this 
report, Martinez was arrested. 
  At the office of Judicial Police Commander Mario Espinoza 
Lobato, Martinez was accused of committing a serious offense by 
tarnishing the image of the Attorney General's Office, PGR, with 
his report. The Televisa correspondent was arrested without a 
warrant. He was held incommunicado for nearly nine hours and 
was transferred to the Saltillo Prison, where he remained until 
this afternoon. This occurred after he broadcast a report which 
the PGR station in Coahuila did not like. They are now saying 
that he committed other offenses. We find this very strange, 
however. We are asking that the abuses against correspondent 
Juan Andres Martinez be dealt with in accordance with the law.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Claudio Picasso Ardito: "Drug Trafficking vs </F>
Nicaragua"] 
  [Text] The U.S. State Department's most recent 
report on drug trafficking and money laundering in Central 
America generated a wave of protest from officials in our 
government. The State Department document tells us that drug 
trafficking and money laundering have increased from 1993 to 
1994, and it specifically names Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica, 
and Honduras. With respect to Nicaragua, it states that our 
country has been slow to pass laws punishing such crimes and 
does not provide adequate financial support for law enforcement 
agencies. 
  Reports by such agencies as the DEA [Drug Enforcement 
Administration], U.S. Customs, the Financial Crime Enforcement 
Network, and others in 1992 and 1993 contain a stockpile of 
information on financial movements and trafficking in harmful 
substances. Indeed, the report sounds the alarm for Nicaragua. 
  Let us look at the facts. Our brand-new commissions seem to 
be unaware of achievements in certain areas. We are specifically 
referring to money laundering, concerning which we can state 
that in Nicaragua, the Central Bank efficiently controls 
exchange banks and other authorized agents. In addition, at a 
meeting held on 25 January 1993 in the offices of the Treasury 
Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission in 
Washington, D.C., it was clearly stated that Nicaragua is not 
among the countries where this type of crime occurs. A 
memorandum from the BCN [Central Bank of Nicaragua] even 
reflects this information. The Superintendency of Banking has 
also instituted efficient control barriers in our commercial 
banks that render money laundering more difficult. 
  Nevertheless, we cannot say that money laundering does not 
take place. We must remember that criminal organizations have 
efficient financial systems and that if they do operate, it must 
be as discreetly as possible, conducting their dealings through 
the uncontrolled commercial underworld that exists in our 
country and paving the way for consolidation. We must be clear 
about this and not engage in speculative, puritanical statements. 
<H5>  Plans </H5>
  The level of drug use in our country has risen from 1990 to 
1994 with respect to Cannabis sativa (marijuana), cocaine, 
amphetamines, and tranquillizers. The increase among young 
people is alarming. There must be no attempt to cover this up 
and Commander Caldera of the National Police has warned of the 
emerging danger on several occasions. Now can we blame the 
Police for their failure to act because we are all aware of the 
limited budget available and the red tape of officials in a 
certain "ministry" that results in operational delays? In the 
meantime, the figures continue to rise noticeably, as we can see 
in our daily newspapers and health reports. 
  Drugs have now made their way into Nicaragua. How do they 
get 
here and from where? What is the reason for the increase? We all 
know that we are surrounded by countries where the transshipment 
and laundering of money is blatant. We are a logical target. 
  We must simply recognize the facts, without euphemisms or 
underestimating the problem. Rising poverty is a hotbed to be 
used by drug traffickers, combined with legal confusion and a 
lack of restrictive criminal laws, an absence of government 
control over mind-altering substances and of adequate mechanisms 
to reduce the availability of dangerous substances, along with a 
lack of (modern) measures regulating the purchase and 
distribution of drugs for medical use. Let us be realistic: It 
is not that we can make a country free of drugs, but we can make 
a country opposed to drugs that is difficult for organized crime 
to penetrate. 
<H5>  Education and Legal and Police Measures </H5>
  The measures are simple but costly, and the investment 
required is enormous in terms of human and economic interests. 
It must initially include the following: 
  1) providing an efficient budget for the National Police to 
be used to improve techniques and modernize means so as to 
create an antidrug atmosphere; drafting legal guidelines for 
speed in operations (functionalality); expanding the range of 
action and equipment of the Economic Department; modernizing the 
crime lab in order to bring it in line with world investigative 
requirements and guidelines; and (Please!) raising the wages of 
our policemen (they are the ones dying because of our apathy); 
  2) drafting efficient laws for the fight against drug 
trafficking and money laundering, not parodies or copies from 
some other jurisdiction, but laws covering summary action and 
harsh sanctions; regulating and giving the force of law to 
police evidence in such crimes; 
  3) organizing the legal system to make it more workable; 
  4) setting up an office to oversee the control, uses, and 
effects of substances and to govern their importation, 
production, and distribution; 
  5) regulating the seizure of drugs, equipment, and dirty 
money from drug traffickers (saving the government budget 
millions) because we still have obsolete laws on the books in 
our country; 
  6) establishing intergovernmental and police cooperation 
with 
specialized agencies via cooperation agreements; and 
  7) promoting education campaigns in our schools. The danger 
is latent and the message is reaching us from all sides. Our 
officials must realize that drugs are destroying entire 
societies today, and we cannot prevent this from happening by 
rhetoric alone.

aboard the Panamanian-registered vessel Christian in the port of 
Coco Solo by the canine section of the Free Zone and the PTJ 
[Judicial Technical Police]. The photograph shows a large 
number of boxes that contained cocaine camouflaged by clothing, 
addressed to the Republic of Haiti as the port of destination. 
Investigations have determined, however, that the true final 
destination of the drug could be the port of Miami.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Aponte, a correspondent in Tingo Maria] </F>
  [Text] Interior Ministry intelligence analysts estimated 
the fortune amassed by Oscar Alberto Ramirez, aka "President 
Feliciano," at $200 million through kickbacks paid by gangs of 
drug traffickers operating in the area known as the coca belt 
region, which is located along the jungle. 
  According to these analysts, who are conducting an 
investigation in the region, Ramirez started to collect this 
money--which accounts for one-third of the total flow moved 
through the marketing of cocaine paste in the region under 
Shining Path [SL] control; that is, $600 million--a few months 
before the arrest of Abimael Guzman. 
  Ramirez managed to do this despite the fact that the SL has 
lost control of major drug centers such as Crespo, Castillo, 
Pueblo Nuevo, Pacayacu, Loro, and recently--as a result of 
Operation "Aries"--Mohena, Moyuna, Venenillo, Mongon, and 
Ancayacu, among others. 
  By contrast, cassava, rice, corn, and other legal crops have 
yielded only $30 million. 
  Through disclosures made by repentant drug traffickers at 
the 
303d Battalion on the Huallaga Front, it has been learned that 
"Feliciano," "El Manco," and other SL leaders who deal with the 
drug traffickers have permanent ground-air contact through 
powerful receivers, portable transmitters, and using coded 
messages. 
  Huallaga Front strategists believe Operation "Aries" 
prompted 
the suspension of flights by Colombian planes in the Leoncio 
Prado (Huanuco) and Padre Abad (Ucayali) areas. 
  Despite the information obtained by counterintelligence 
agents from repented former SL leaders and peasants forced to 
work for the SL for some time, there is no firm clue as to the 
place where the fortune Ramirez amassed by exacting kickbacks 
from drug traffickers is hidden. 
  There is evidence, however, that drug traffickers and SL 
members circulate large amounts of dollars through local 
branches of banks and financial companies. The fact is that not 
all the proceeds from drug sales are "laundered" in Lima by 
individual money exchangers or through investments in legally 
constituted companies. 
  There are several financial companies competing for 
narcodollars along the coca belt region. According to 
intelligence sources, no one should be surprised if "Feliciano" 
made large deposits through a front, if he is keeping a major 
portion of the money, or he distributed it through his closest 
aides and henchmen. 
  The truth is that the money is concentrated in few hands 
because those terrorists who are clashing with security 
forces--the ones called the "rank-and-file"--are poorly fed, 
dressed in rags, and suffering from contagious diseases such as 
scabies, tuberculosis, and cholera. 
  Some repented SL leaders who were recently captured admitted 
that most of those now following "El Manco" have absolutely no 
morale, that they are following him out of fear for their 
families who have been kidnapped by the SL, which has threatened 
to murder them. 
  It has been reported that drug shipments have been suspended 
after the dismantling of the so-called "Red Sea" battalion and 
as a result of the capture and/or surrender of many subversives 
and the action of antisubversive forces at the Ucayali Navy base. 
  Based on information obtained in the region, it has been 
ascertained that each shipment consisted of 300 or 500 kg of 
basic cocaine paste, depending on whether the carrier was a 
single-engine or twin-engine plane, respectively. 
  DEA agents said that basic cocaine paste produced in the 
coca 
belt is transported to large refinery laboratories located in 
the Amazon Trapeze jungle (an area located between Brazil, 
Colombia, and Peru) where, after being processed into cocaine 
hydrochloride, it is shipped to the United States and Europe.

  [Text] Lima, 15 May (EFE) -- Military sources in the Upper 
Huallaga jungle region have reported that on 15 May Peruvian 
security forces seized 150 kg of cocaine base after finding a 
Colombian light plane. 
  The sources added that the plane was found early on Sunday 
morning. It had been abandoned on a clandestine airfield in San 
Pablo, San Martin Department. 
  The situation of the plane is being investigated. It is 
believed to have been abandoned by traffickers after they were 
discovered by an Army patrol. 
  The site where the Colombian plane was found is considered a 
"red zone" where coca is grown and macerated into cocaine base. 
  Peruvian cocaine base is taken to laboratories in Colombia 
where it is processed into pure cocaine.

  [Text] The Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] approved 
last night by an ample majority the top quantities of drugs that 
will, for legal purposes, be considered small quantities, as 
well as early deadlines for certain cases involving the crime of 
drug trafficking. 
  Up to 100 grams of cocaine paste and illegal byproducts, 25 
grams of cocaine hydrochloride, 200 grams of marijuana, and 20 
grams of marijuana byproducts will therefore be the limits for 
`small' quantities, which will determine a prison term of not 
less than two years and not more than eight years, a 365-day 
fine, and disability as established by Article 298 of the Penal 
Code. 
  The same legal standard establishes that, if drugs are 
distributed in small quantities and directly to individual 
consumers who are not chargeable, there will be a prison term of 
not less than one year and not more than four years, a fine 
ranging from 180 to 365 days, and disability. 
  According to its whereas clause, the bill approved last 
night, which was initially remitted by the executive branch and 
subsequently corrected by the CCD Justice Commission, seeks to 
correct the inaccuracy in Article 298 that prompted contentious 
jurisprudence. 
  The bill also establishes a special, expeditious trial, 
which 
represents a one-sixth reduction of the sentences that must be 
added to the reductions received for confessing a crime. 
  Another approved bill involves changing the priority level 
of 
obligations of financial system organizations and savings and

  [Text] The only place where the MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] still has some strength is the central 
jungle. There it has a column that is allegedly headed by 
Nestor Serpa Cartolini himself, and which allegedly has a 
considerable number of weapons, according to two MRTA chiefs 
arrested by the Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate] 
and presented to the media on 6 May. 
  The area of influence of this armed group is located between 
La Merced, Satipo, and Pichis, and in the jungle in Junin and 
Pasco Departments. There they continue to carry out attacks, 
although these are not as harmful as those carried out in the 
past. 
  In the January and February issues of the MRTA mouthpiece LA 
VOZ REBELDE, the MRTA claims responsibility for several attacks, 
most of them in the central jungle, a few in the north, and a 
few in Lima. 
  However, the group that acted in the north was deactivated 
with the arrest of Juan Antonio Leon Montero, aka "Perseo," 
member of the MRTA national directorate. 
  The MRTA also suffered harsh blows in Lima, especially last 
month with the Alacran 3 Operation carried out by the second 
Dincote division, which arrested Emilio Villalobos Alva, aka 
"Celso" or "Polo," and nearly all the members of its "Special 
Forces"--a detachment that specialized in kidnappings and in 
collecting protection money from businessmen. 
  Dincote said that 20 MRTA bases in Peru have so far been 
dismantled. In face of this the MRTA members who no longer have 
a regional command have retreated to Lima and to the Central 
Jungle area, as well as to Jaen and the surroundings of Huancayo. 
  This means that there currently remain only four MRTA 
bastions. The main one is in the central jungle. Those in Jaen 
and Huancayo are unstable, and the command in Lima is trying to 
recover the time lost, this time under the command of the number 
two man of the MRTA: Miguel Rincon Rincon. 
  Dincote has said that in general terms, the MRTA forces are 
disbanding. 
  For example, the members of the "Martin La Torre Escalante" 
platoon that carried out actions south of Peru, especially in 
Puno, are fleeing to Bolivia, where MRTA leader Sonia Cuentas 
supports them. 
  This platoon, which bears the name of one of the terrorists 
who died in the Los Molinos operation in 1989, is headed by 
Justino Soto Vargas, aka "Lucho Chico," among others 
  The MRTA members who remained in Trujillo and Chiclayo have 
retreated to Jaen. Many MRTA members of Lima have also 
emigrated to Tarma and Junin. 
  According to the documents that were found, the MRTA plans 
to 
take what remains of its military forces to La Convencion 
(Cuzco), and Aguaytia (Ucayali). 
  According to Dincote detectives, this is a strategic retreat 
with the purpose of recovering the control of the coca producing 
zones as well as the financing for their actions. 
  Given the action of the forces of order, the MRTA has lost a 
lot of its area of influence at a national level, especially in 
the Huallaga region and in other coca producing zones that 
constituted its emporium and had become its base of actions. 
  Now it will be very difficult for the MRTA members to return 
to these zones, not only because of the Armed Force's actions, 
but also because the voids it left were quickly occupied by the 
Shining Path.

leader made this accusation in the House last week. Since then, 
he has been repeating it at recent political meetings. (Sharon 
Coward) tells us more:

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" Report by Ramon Meneses from Puerto Ayacucho] </F>
  [Text] DEA reports on the increasing use of Venezuela as a 
bridge for drugs have also revealed that the "doors" open to the 
south, specifically in the Amazon and Apure regions, a 
high-level police official has reported. 
  "This situation has been getting more serious every day. 
During the past years, the drug barons, who were operating in 
neighboring Colombia, have transferred all their laboratories to 
areas in Vichada and Guainia regions. It has been easy for them 
to work in those secluded areas because the presence of security 
forces is sparse there," Venezuelan intelligence officials have 
pointed out. 
  People know about the groups in Puerto Ayacucho but they 
move 
very cautiously due to the [words indistinct] with the movement 
of money and weapons. Many people have reported encountering 
drug traffickers when they are working in the Amazon region. 
Drug traffickers reportedly have opened roads in the Montana 
Fria, Rueda, and Garcitas areas, to the south of Puerto 
Ayacucho. They also reportedly opened another road in the 
northern area, very near Puerto Paez, to take advantage of 
Puerto Carreno and other Vichada towns. 
  A prominent National Guard official, who has been working 
against drug traffickers for several years, has reported: 
"People don't talk about them because they fear retributions, 
but seeing how the drug traffickers are increasing their ties in 
the region and apprehensive that their quiet existence in the 
Amazons may turn into violence like in Colombia, they are now 
cooperating and we have been informed of the drug traffickers' 
paths in the south." 
<H5>  The Road is Free on the Colombian Side </H5>
  Due to the freedom they have on the other side of the 
Orinoco 
[Colombia], Venezuelan authorities can do little about the 
presence of the drug traffickers in the Venezuelan side. The 
drug traffickers control entire towns in the neighboring country 
and authorities do not get close, sometimes due to fear and 
others due to compliance with the illegal activity. "Things are 
so serious that on one occasion we arrested a Colombian citizen 
who had a large amount of drugs on him in Puerto Ayacucho and we 
were surprised to find out that he was the top police official 
in a town close to the Amazon capital city. How can you fight 
against this?" the official asked. 
  The Orinoco is a long fluvial highway, through which 
Venezuelan authorities, by an agreement signed with Colombian 
authorities, are able to transit freely. They did not consider 
that international right today would cause a serious problem on 
that bordering and depressed region where drug traffickers have 
set up their headquarters and where they secure allies in all 
the sectors of the, up until now respectable, community. 
  Enrique Betancourt, one of only two native governors that 
region has had in all its history, and one of the few strugglers 
against that scourge said: "When I was governor I ordered 
measures against all the drug traffickers' fronts, because I 
knew that it [drugs] was filtering through the weak and scarcely 
guarded border. Unfortunately my administration was short-lived. 
However, during those months not one act of violence took place 
in the state and not one case of kidnaping was reported, as is 
happening today, he noted. This scourge has been spreading its 
evil on several fronts of our community, from which officials of 
the security corps and officials of the governorship do not 
escape." 
  Betancourt said: "It is of no avail to report personal 
incidents linked to drug trafficking if a stiff and courageous 
response does not exist by those in charge of enforcing the law. 
These individuals, most of them from Caracas, become powerful 
lords based on false promises and positions from which they 
manipulate and operate under their superiors' complacent gaze; 
this is also a crime," the former governor of that Amazon region 
stressed.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Xiao Hang (4562 5300): "Public Security </F>
Steps Up Operations Against Drug Trafficking"] 
  [Text] Stepped-up antidrug operations by public security 
organs across the country since early this year have resulted in 
the solving of more than 2,000 drug cases--almost double the 
number in the same period last year--and the seizure of more 
than 2,000 kg of drugs. 
  Guided by identified drug-trafficking patterns, public 
security organs in southwest border provinces and regions, and 
those along the southeast coast--such as Yunnan, Guangxi, 
Fujian, and Guangdong--stepped up reconnaissance and border and 
coastal interceptions, thereby solving cases, boosting the 
number of cases solved in the first quarter, and achieving a 
greater rate of crime-busting than the same period last year. 
Yunnan solved 900 drug cases in the first quarter, seizing more 
than 700 kg of heroin; and solved a major drug case involving 
over 10 kg of heroin on each of six days from late March to 
early April. 
  Guangxi and Guangdong public security organs solved more 
than 
400 drug cases and arrested a number of drug traffickers from 
outside the borders in the first quarter. Aimed at stopping 
criminals from taking advantage of the increasing social 
intercourse between the two shores of the strait to traffic 
drugs, Fujian public security organs increased efforts at 
cracking these cases, solving 22 drug-trafficking cases in the 
first quarter, seizing close to 40 kg of drugs, and arresting 57 
suspects, some of them of Taiwan origin. 
  In their struggle against drugs, public security organs made 
a point of mobilizing and relying on the masses to launch a 
people's war against drugs. On 22 February, a peasant in 
Lijiang County, Yunnan Province, picked up a bundle of sugar 
cane on a road and found in it 51 g of heroin wrapped in a 
plastic bag. He reported this immediately to the public 
security organ, which investigated and followed the lead, 
thereby solving a major drug case. 
  The Ministry of Public Security recently issued notices 
commending public security organs for the brilliant results they 
have scored in the battle against drugs.

marked as containing dog food, was shipped from Bangkok to 
Poland in July but was returned when it went unclaimed in 
Poland. (Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 12 May 94 p 1)

  [Text] Sengchun Salween, spokesman of the Shan State SLORC 
[State Law and Order Restoration Council], revealed that the Tai 
Yai's national liberation army under the leadership of Khun Sa 
earlier launched attacks on the strongholds of Burmese 
Government troops in all parts of the Shan State and seized from 
the government side several towns such as Mong Hsat, Kengtung, 
Mong Hsai, Doi Laem, Doi Namchang, and Mong Chot. The fighting 
between three battalions and seven companies of government 
troops and Khun Sa's army and a combined force comprising Tai 
Yai, Red Wa, Haw, and Karen ethnic groups resulted in the deaths 
of 300 of Khun Sa's soldiers and injuries to 600 others. 
Casualties on the government side were 500 killed and over 
1,000 wounded. The government sent six jet fighters to bomb 
Mong Pan, now under Khun Sa's control, but the bombing mission 
had to be canceled due to poor visibility. Moreover, Khun Sa 
has reportedly installed 10 SAM-7 missiles around Muang Jod to 
deter any attempted offensives by the government side. 
  According to the latest battle report, several government 
battalions attacked Khun Sa's strongholds and recaptured all the 
towns except the major strategic township of Mong Chot. Some 
7,000 government troops together with 1,200 porters are now 
rallying in an area north of Mong Chot on the western bank of 
the Salween River. 
  Phairot Thomat, a senior district clerk of Wiang Haeng 
District in Chiang Mai Province, disclosed that the battle 
between the Burmese Government troops and Khun Sa's army took 
place some 18 kilometers from the Thai border and the sound of 
gunfire could be heard in the district for the whole day 
yesterday. The report received by the district office confirmed 
the recapture of several towns from Khun Sa's army by the 
government side. Meanwhile, Narong Kon-athit, chief of Wiang 
Haeng District, is now inspecting and closely monitoring the 
situation along the Thai-Burmese border. 
  According to a correspondent dispatch, trade activities at 
Piang Luang market comprising 150 shops and the black market at 
Lak Taeng village in Wiang Haeng District were rather sluggish. 
Some shops reported that their daily sales were less than 300 
baht. Earlier, the amount of money circulating at the markets 
each month was formerly recorded at 30 to 40 million baht. 
  Tat Thon, chief of the Information Office of the Shan State 
SLORC, said during an interview that he had not received any 
reports on the United States planning to join the suppression 
operation against Khun Sa's army. However, he reaffirmed that 
Khun Sa's army is still capable of putting up resistance to the 
government's offensives. 
  According to a report from Government House, the issue of 
drug kingpin Khun Sa or Chang Sifu, was raised up for discussion 
during the 20 May meeting of the National Security Council, as 
it has been reported that the United States will join hands with 
the Burmese Government to launch a massive suppression operation 
against Khun Sa in the near future. The United States believes 
that the success of operation will greatly reduce the amount of 
narcotics smuggled to that country while the operation itself 
helps the Burmese Government eliminate its ethnic enemy. 
Burmese soldiers will be used during the operation while the 
U.S. side provides logistics support. 
  The meeting reportedly agreed that Thai authorities must be 
alert and impose stricter security measures along the border 
with Burma to prevent any intrusion and ensure security for Thai 
villagers in the border areas.

  [Editorial Report] The daily PUSAN ILBO's 30 March 1994 
edition on page 23 carried a report that the office of the Pusan 
District Prosecutor arrested six philopon [crystal 
methamphetamine] smugglers, including an overseas 
Chinese-Korean, Wang Chin-saeng, who is employed by Kimpo 
Airport Customs as an interpreter. Chong Yong-sok and Kim 
Kil-tae were among the six arrested. 
  According to the prosecutor's office, the leader, Chong 
Yong-sok, paid Wang four million won [approximately U.S. 
$50,000] to accompany Chong and Kim Kil-tae to Taipei, Taiwan 
and interpret for them. Chong purchased one kilogram of 
philopon for five billion won [approximately U.S. $6.25 million] 
in Taipei and returned to Korea through Kimpo International with 
the drug concealed in the clothes Kim was wearing. 
  The smugglers were arrested on 28 March while they were 
contacting drug dealers in the Namdaemun market areas in Seoul. 
The one kilogram of philopon was seized as evidence when they 
were arrested. 
  Along with scrutinizing the background of Chong's drug 
business, the prosecutor's office has expanded the investigation 
because of Wang's involvement. The investigators are looking 
into the customs office and its employees for possible 
involvement in drug trafficking.

  [Text] A meeting to publicize a comprehensive plan for drug 
control for the period from now to the year 2000 was held in 
Vientiane on the morning of 16 May. The meeting was chaired by 
Souban Salitthilat, deputy minister of foreign affairs and 
chairman of the Lao National Committee for Narcotics Control. 
It was attended by (Ms. Amerera Haq-perera), representative of 
the United Nations Development Program, along with many 
representatives from 10 northern provinces and representatives 
of various ministries and departments concerned. 
  Souban Salitthilat noted drug addiction as a problem which 
seriously threatens the world society at present. He said: 
Drug addiction and trafficking have been widely expanded, thus 
bringing about an adverse effect to the world. It is considered 
a problem for which everyone must be jointly held responsible. 
The deputy minister of foreign affairs noted: The Government 
of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] has regarded as 
an important task the reduction of supply of opium and other 
addictive plants. To achieve the said goal, the LPDR Government 
has utilized all sources of funds totaling some $28 million from 
various countries as well as from international organizations to 
implement four projects in five provinces in the northern 
region, such as the Pha Lavek project in Vientiane Province, the 
Lao-American project in Houa Phan Province, and the rural 
development projects in Xieng Khouang, Bokeo, and Luang Namtha 
Provinces. At the same time, the government implemented a 
strategy of persuading people who have earned their living on 
slash-and-burn cultivation to switch to plains land to do rice 
farming and plant other types of crops, which can bring about 
higher revenues. This strategy can also help preserve the 
environment. 
  Souban Salitthilat stressed: The Lao Government presently 
has been prepared to cooperate, through every possible means, 
with all countries and international organizations in solving 
this problem on the basis of the principles of respecting each 
other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and 
mutual benefit. In cooperating with the UN Commission on 
Narcotic Drugs, the Lao Government has adopted a comprehensive 
narcotics control plan for implementation for the period from 
now to the year 2000. Stipulated in the said plan are the 
urgent needs as noted in the government's strategic plan, 
policy, and (projects) for actual practice, including the 
gradual reduction of poppy plantation; the elimination of the 
planting of marijuana for commercial purposes; the reduction and 
control of narcotics demand; the suppression and control of 
illicit trading, production, and other illegal acts involving 
narcotics; and working in cooperation with the world in dealing 
with this problem.

  [Text] Taipei, May 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan is planning to enact 
a law to prevent money laundering, Justice Minister Ma Ying-Jeou 
said Tuesday [17 May]. 
  Ma made the statement while meeting with a delegation from 
the G-7 Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a group of 
regulators set up in 1989 by the Group of Seven industrial 
countries to fight cross-border financial crime. 
  Many industrial countries, including the United States, 
France, Britain, Australia, Italy, Holland, and Luxembourg, have 
passed legislation outlawing money laundering. 
  Ma said the Ministry of Justice will start to draft 
regulations soon in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance and 
the Central Bank of China to prevent laundering of criminal 
money from drug and other illegal dealings. 
  "The legislation is needed as Taiwan is playing an 
increasingly important role in global trade and financial 
exchanges," Ma noted. 
  Under the draft regulations, Taiwan will require banks to 
report suspicious transactions to government authorities. 
  The draft bill is expected to be completed by the end of 
this 
year, Ma said. 
  The FATF delegation, headed by John Gieve, British 
undersecretary of treasury, said the Paris-based organization 
initiated in the 1988 G-7 economic summit would provide 
counseling services for Taiwan to pass legislation against money 
laundering. 
  The group, composed of experts from America, Japan and 
Britain, arrived in Taipei Sunday to check Taiwan's progress in 
the fight against money laundering. They will depart Wednesday.

  [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan's first civilian 
anti-narcotics group was established in Taipei Saturday [14 May] 
with Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou witnessing the kick-off 
ceremony. 
  At the ceremony inaugurating the Republic of China [ROC] 
Anti-Drug Promotion Group, Ma said that the work against 
narcotics should be deeply rooted in people's minds, and that it 
depends on both government and civilian efforts. 
  He said the anti-drug movement must be jointly pushed by 
both 
government and people, since the moet powerful weapons against 
illegal drugs are in the hands of citizens themselves. 
  Executive director of the newly-established group Liu 
Chang-luen said he and group members will take concrete actions 
over a long period of time in line with Premier Lien Chan's 
policy of combining government and civilian efforts in a war 
against drugs. 
  Those attending the inauguration ceremony at the Taipei 
international convention center included Vice Justice Minister 
Lin Hsi-hu, Legislator Rau Ying-chi, and National Assemblyman 
Tsai Chung-chi.

  [Text] Ten active Opposition MP's and seven former MP's 
have been suspected by the United States of involvement in the 
narcotics trade and three have been denied entry visas to the 
U.S., Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri told the Cabinet 
yesterday. 
  A Cabinet source said Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong said 
the three MP's denied visas still sat in the House. He named 
one of them as Chat Phatthana Party MP for Chiang Rai Mongkhon 
Chongsuthamani. 
  Mr Mongkhon could not be reached yesterday for a statement. 
  The U.S. Embassy refused comment on the allegation against 
Mr 
Mongkhon. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong's revelations came as the Cabinet discussed 
at length the drug allegations against Chat Thai MP for Nakhon 
Phanom Thanong Siriprichaphong. 
  An Interior Ministry source said the U.S. suspicions that Mr 
Mongkhon was involved in the drugs trade and the refusal to 
grant him an entry visa was also mentioned in a letter sent from 
the Foreign Ministry to the Interior Ministry yesterday. 
  The Foreign Ministry said in the letter that the U.S. had 
asked Thailand to arrest Mr Thanong and send him to that country 
for trial. 
  The ministry said the U.S. had also informed it it had 
denied 
an entry visa to Mr Mongkhon on suspicions he had been involved 
in the narcotics trade in the U.S. under similar circumstances 
to Mr Thanong. 
  Mr Mongkhon's visa request was denied in March. 
  The U.S. said some people had sought information about Mr 
Mongkhon, but its only reply had been "no comment", the Foreign 
Ministry stated in its letter. 
  The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, when asked about this matter 
yesterday, declined comment. 
  Mr Mongkhon is known widely in his home province as "Sia 
Lek". 
  He is a former close aide to Narong Wongwan, former leader 
of 
the now-defunct Samakkhi Tham Party, who was also denied an 
entry visa by the United States for similar reasons. 
  An elder brother of Mr Mongkhon is now serving time in jail 
after being sentenced to death on drug charges in April 1992. 
  Mr Mongkhon, 48, was elected to represent Chiang Rai in 
1983, 
1986, 1988 and 1992. He served as secretary to the agriculture 
and cooperatives minister in 1990. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong also told the Cabinet he was ready to 
testify 
before the House Committee on Parliamentary Affairs concerning 
this matter tomorrow. 
  The Cabinet yesterday considered legal points to decide 
whether Mr Thanong could be sent to the United States for trial. 
  Four laws were taken into consideration--the Extradition Act 
of 1929, the International Cooperation on Crime Act of 1992, the 
Thai- U.S. extradition treaty of 1990 and the Narcotics 
Suppression Act of 1979. 
  According to the U.S. indictment, Mr Thanong was involved in 
smuggling marijuana between 1977 and 1987. 
  This means Mr Thanong cannot be sent for trial in the U.S. 
under the extradition treaty. 
  According to the Narcotics Suppression Act of 1979, crimes 
which took place abroad cannot be tried in Thailand. The 
Narcotics Suppression Act, which was amended in 1992, also 
cannot be enforced retroactively. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said after the Cabinet meeting 
it was still unclear whether Mr Thanong could be sent to the U.S. 
  He said the Juridical Council had been asked to make 
recommendations. The council will also study the possibility of 
having Mr Thanong undergo trial in Thailand. 
  The source said Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut told 
the Cabinet the evidence against Mr Thanong lacked weight if he 
was tried in Thailand. 
  He said consideration must be given to whether the U.S. 
indictment against Mr Thanong could be used as evidence. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong also admitted the local evidence against the 
MP was insubstantial. 
  The Interior Ministry has decided it cannot arrest Mr 
Thanong 
and send him to the U.S. because the alleged crimes were not 
committed in Thailand. 
  The decision follows a meeting yesterday between Permanent 
Secretary Ari Wong-araya and his deputies, Chaiwat Hutacharoen 
and Chaloem Promloet, said the source. 
  The source said Thailand had been asked to send Mr Thanong 
to 
the U.S. under an extradition treaty between the two countries 
signed in 1990. 
  An alternative was to send him to a third country which has 
an extradition treaty with the U.S. as Washington realizes the 
extradition of Mr Thanong is not possible under the Extradition 
Act of 1929. The Interior Ministry based its decision on this 
act. 
  The Foreign Ministry also informed the Interior Ministry in 
its letter that 10 Americans suspected of conspiracy with Mr 
Thanong had been sentenced to jail.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai told Parliament 
yesterday some MP's were suspected of involvement in drug deals 
and he vowed to get rid of them. 
  He said he had a list of suspected drug dealing politicians, 
including MP's and provincial and local politicians, but 
declined to reveal who or how many there were. 
  Mr Chuan said the list was not updated and those who had 
been 
in previous governments for the past several years would know as 
much as he did. 
  But the list of suspected drug dealing politicians was not 
provided by Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, according to the 
Premier. 
  The Premier pledged to take action against all drug dealers 
no matter if they were MP's or other politicians. 
  "Don't ask who they are or how many. That's useless. We 
don't have any evidence to pin them down. We only have 
suspicions." 
  Mr Chuan said he did not have any evidence which could lead 
to the arrests of any MP's and disclosure of their names would 
not be of any help. 
  "It's the duty of my Government to suppress all vice and I 
believe no party wants to have bad MP's." 
  But the Premier did not confirm or deny news reports that 
Sqn 
Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong had claimed in a Cabinet meeting 
on Tuesday that 17 MP's were allegedly drug dealers. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong dismissed the reports during his testimony 
before the House Committee for Parliamentary Affairs as well as 
during the full House meeting yesterday. 
  The minister said he was doing the right thing for the 
prestige of Parliament and the country. 
  "It's a shame on us all. If you wore a bucket to hide your 
face, I would wear a bucket to hide my face, too," he said 
referring to drug claims against MP's. 
  Mr Chuan said Cabinet meetings were supposed to be secret 
but 
admitted it was his Government's fault some information was 
leaked to the press. 
  Chat Phatthana MP Sophon Phetsawang and a few other MP's 
insisted the Premier tell the House whether or not Sqn Ldr 
Prasong had made such a claim during the weekly Cabinet meeting. 
  The Premier said the foreign minister had shown documents 
provided by United States authorities through the U.S. Embassy 
in Bangkok on allegations that Chat Thai MP Thanong 
Siriprichaphong and Chat Phatthana MP Mongkhon Chongsuthamani 
had been involved in drug deals. 
  The U.S. authorities seized Mr Thanong's home and car in 
California, lodged criminal charges against the Chat Thai MP for 
his alleged marijuana smuggling and revoked in March a visa for 
Mr Mongkhon, also suspected of having dealt in drugs. 
  The foreign minister reported this to the Cabinet, Mr Chuan 
said. 
  Mr Thanong was suspected to be a marijuana smuggler between 
1977 and 1987, the period during which he was not a Chat Thai 
MP, but the information pertaining to the claims was only 
recently exposed to the press, according to Mr Chuan. 
  He did not think there was any conspiracy outside Parliament 
which might want to sabotage the House; only some MP's who might 
want to discredit other MP's or tarnish the entire House. 
  "I don't think there is any conspiracy. It's only among us. 
Don't blame anybody else." 
  His comment followed several MPs' claim that drug dealing 
charges against the 17 MP's might have been made as part of a 
conspiracy outside Parliament aimed at destroying the entire 
House. 
  Mr Chuan dismissed criticism that drugs claims surrounding 
the Opposition MPs were designed to pre-empt a no-confidence 
motion the Opposition had planned to launch against his 
Government.

  [Text] Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday 
issued a stern warning to the mass media, threatening tighter 
controls if they continue to publish or broadcast reports which 
affect innocent people. 
  The warning came amid much coverage in the press and other 
media on allegations of drug trafficking involving politicians. 
  The controversial reports were fuelled by a broadcast on 
Thursday by the radio Independent Network News (INN), which gave 
the initials of a number of politicians, government officials 
and police who were allegedly involved in the drug trade. 
  "Take it as my last request," Chawalit said. 
  "I will not stand it if their reports affect innocent people 
again. Don't blame me if I take drastic action. I may ask to 
see the information before publication or broadcast." 
  Chawalit said if his warning was not heeded, his tough 
actions might start with reporters being prohibited from 
entering the Interior Ministry's compound for three days. 
  "From now on we must get tough with the mass media on their 
news presentation," Chawalit said. 
  "If it is not true as reported, innocent people will be 
affected. This will also affect the credibility of the radio 
announcers if their reports are not true." 
  Chawalit said he would ensure that the affected party 
receives fair treatment in news coverage and presentation. 
  "We must deal with this problem seriously to bring about 
fair 
treatment. The mass media are not free to write anything and 
broadcast it the way they like. 
  "We must control the mass media to be up to standard to 
protect innocent people from being affected." 
  INN, quoting unnamed anti-narcotics officials, reported on 
Thursday that three government MP's were involved in narcotics 
trafficking. It identified them by their initials and 
positions, and said they belonged to a political party whose 
leader is the prime minister. 
  Later the agency said three opposition MP's were also 
involved in narcotics trafficking. Although it identified them 
only by their initials, it provided other details such as 
constituencies and party affiliations which made identification 
easy. 
  Senior anti-drug officials on Thursday denied INN's claim 
that staff of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) 
passed evidence of drug trafficking to the agency. 
  Speaking at a press conference at the Interior Ministry, 
Chawalit said he summoned the INN editor to question him about 
the sources of the news. 
  "He still insisted that he had received the correct 
information and had verified the information. But he refused to 
identify his sources," Chawalit said. 
  Chawalit said he would like INN to apologize formally to the 
mentioned people to prevent more problems. 
  "I think the mentioned people are ready to forgive so that 
there would be no more trouble," the minister said. 
  But, Chawalit said, he expected more trouble because the 
news 
agency insisted it had done nothing wrong. 
  Three Democrat MP's have vowed to sue INN while opposition 
members were also reported to be considering similar action. 
  A senior police official accused by the agency also 
threatened to seek damages of Bt20 million. 
  The minister said he would not revive the annulled Decree 
42, 
which once allowed police to shut down newspapers without 
seeking court orders. 
  Chawalit said many complaints had been made against the mass 
media recently. 
  He cited a headline by SIAM POST newspaper, partly saying 
"the Parliament of duo lions on the globe"--a reference to a 
brand of heroin--as an example of a news report which affected 
innocent people. 
  "All parliamentarians were angry at being accused this way," 
Chawalit said. 
  The minister said he would like the mass media to act with 
honor and credibility by not publishing untrue reports. 
  "I would like them to identify their sources more clearly," 
the minister said. 
  Late Thursday night, INN radio news identified more 
businessmen and politicians it alleged were involved in drug 
trafficking. 
  INN quoted sources again quoted from the ONCB. This time, 
though, INN gave full names and surnames of the alleged drug 
traffickers.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Don't Blame the Media for MP's Alleged Drug </F>
Dealing"] 
  [Text] There were fireworks in Parliament on Thursday over 
drug allegations against MPs. 
  Several lawmakers have been suspected of involvement in drug 
trafficking. Thanong Siriprichaphong, an opposition Chat Thai 
MP, has been charged by U.S. authorities with smuggling more 
than 45 tonnes of marijuana into the United States between 1977 
and 1987. 
  On Tuesday, it was reported that Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri told the Cabinet that a further 17 Thai politicians had 
been blacklisted by the United States for suspected involvement 
in drugs. Of the 17 accused, he reportedly said 10 were present 
opposition lawmakers and seven former MP's. 
  Fuelling speculation further were fresh allegations made by 
the Independent Network News [INN] radio that apart from 
opposition MP's, three government lawmakers were also suspected 
of involvement in the drug trade. INN, quoting unnamed 
anti-narcotics officials, identified them only by their initials 
and positions, and said they belonged to a political party whose 
leader is the prime minister, an obvious reference to the 
Democrat Party. 
  While the government was caught offguard, INN also turned 
the 
heat on the opposition by identifying three leading opposition 
MP's alleged to be involved with illegal drugs, through their 
initials, constituencies and party affiliations. 
  Rather than initiate serious action in response to these 
allegations. Lawmakers--both government and opposition--have 
tended to blame the media for the controversy that only appears 
to be getting messier. 
  After angry opposition parties on Wednesday threatened to 
seek his expulsion if he failed to name the 17 suspected MP's, 
Foreign Minister Prasong apparently got cold feet and denied 
ever telling the Cabinet about the 17. Prasong said he had only 
told the Cabinet meeting that Thai people from various fields 
including the military, the police, business and politics are 
involved in drug smuggling, without naming any individuals. 
  "If anybody here wants to talk about the 17 MP's, then go 
and 
ask the media which publicized the issue, he said. 
  When cornered, it is easy to pass the buck and blame the 
messenger for whatever consequences might arise in the pursuit 
to accurately report events to the public. 
  The fact of the matter is that the individuals implicated 
are 
not ordinary Thais. They are the people's representatives in 
Parliament--which is supposed to be the bulwark of democracy. 
  The role of the media in Thailand, unlike in several 
neighboring countries, is to act as the public's watchdog. If 
politicians with backgrounds that indicate they have made 
fortunes illicitly have been elected as MP's, then the public 
has every right to know about it. 
  After the bloody May events in 1992, all politicians have to 
realize that democracy in the country is of the people, by the 
people and for the people, with the media playing the very 
important role safeguarding the people's interests. 
  Recent remarks made by opposition MP's that Foreign Minister 
Prasong as well as the three Democrat lawmakers should sue 
newspapers and radio stations for reporting "lies" are uncalled 
for and show the narrow-mindedness typical of many members of 
parliament. 
  When members of Parliament are implicated in 
drug-trafficking, they cannot just be viewed as isolated 
incidents because the image of the whole country is adversely 
affected. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai told Parliament he would not 
hesitate to get rid of MP's if they were involved in drug 
trafficking. "It's the duty of my government to suppress all 
vice and I believe no party wants to have bad MP's," he added. 
  But these are mere words and mean nothing unless concrete 
action is taken. 
  Money laundering legislation must be introduced without 
delay 
giving authorities the right to investigate the financial status 
of drug suspects. In the world today, hard drugs like heroin 
and cocaine are killing thousands of people every year. 
Unfortunately, in Thailand it appears there are many people 
occupying positions of power who have no compunction whatsoever 
about supplying illegal drugs to foreign markets. Amassing 
wealth through such illegal means does not even prick their 
conscience. 
  For democracy to work, even on the most basic level, the 
public must be kept informed. It is the duty of the media to 
provide the information necessary to help people vote in good 
MPs to the House of Representatives. 
  The media is only trying its best to preserve the dignity of 
the House by reporting what is actually happening. In the 
broader interests of the country and salvaging Thailand's 
international reputation the media must not be prevented from 
doing so.

  [Excerpt] The Chat Thai Party has approved the resignation 
of Thanong Siriprichaphong, member of the House of 
Representatives from Nakhon Phanom, who is accused by the United 
States of being involved in the narcotics trade. Thanong's 
resignation from the party thus automatically terminated his 
membership in the House. 
  Speaking to reporters at Chat Thai Party's head office at 
noon today, Banhan Sinlapa-acha, leader of Chat Thai Party, said 
that the approval of Thanong Siriprichaphong's resignation was 
made on the recommendation of the fact-finding committee set up 
earlier by the party. However, as yet, Thanong Siriprichaphong 
is still considered innocent because the court has not yet ruled 
that he is guilty. Banhan said the drug charge against Thanong 
has caused severe damage to the country and its political 
institutions as well as to the Chat Thai Party. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday 
ruled out the possibility of embattled MP Thanong 
Siriprichaphong being prosecuted in Thailand unless Washington 
provides more evidence to substantiate drug trafficking 
accusations against him. 
  Chawalit said after meeting with other senior officials 
concerned that the U.S. government had only provided a copy of 
its indictment against Thanong. That was not sufficient to 
prosecute a case before a Thai court, he said. 
  At the meeting with Chawalit were Deputy Permanent Secretary 
Ari Wong-araya, Interior Ministry legal adviser Chailoet 
Ditsamnat, national Police Chief Prathin Santipraphop, Deputy 
Police Chief Pol Gen Phot Bunyachinda, Assistant Police Chief 
Thanu Homhuan and Chawalit's personal secretary, Sonchai 
Montriwat. 
  "The copy of the U.S. indictment cannot alone be used as 
evidence to substantiate drug allegations against Thanong. The 
police cannot do anything at present," Chawalit said. 
  The minister has ordered Prathin to ask the Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) for more details relating to the charges. 
  Chawalit also said he wants more information from Washington 
about Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri's revelation that 17 
other Thai MP's stand accused by the U.S. of being involved in 
drug trafficking. 
  Chawalit has ordered the Office of Narcotics Control Board 
to 
gather evidence related to the Thanong issue. Prathin said he 
is awaiting additional information from the Foreign Ministry. 
  Asked to confirm a Chat Thai Party statement that Thanong 
faces only six months in jail if convicted here of drug 
trafficking, Chawalit said he does not know the penalty involved. 
  Given adequate evidence, Prathin said, Thanong would not 
escape prosecution on any drug charges just because of his 
stature or influence. 
  Attorney General Ophat Arunin said yesterday the government 
should decide quickly whether to extradite Chat Thai MP Thanong 
Siriprichaphong to face drug trafficking charges in the United 
States. 
  Ophat will testify today before the House committee on 
parliamentary affairs which is investigating the issue. He 
would infomm the committee of all information he received from 
U.S. officials.

MP for trial in the United States. [begin recording]

  Unidentified reporter: What is the government's 
position? Will the MP be tried here or extradited to the United 
States? 
  Prasong: If there is a law that allows an 
extradition, we will probably have to cooperate with the United 
States to preserve our country's reputation. If the law does 
not allow this, then we will not be able to extradite him. The 
legal specialists will consult the law in case the United States 
requests an extradition. 
  Reporter: In most previous cases, the United 
States was able to bring major drug traffickers to trial in its 
courts. 
  Prasong: Most of them were arrested in the United 
States or in third countries. 
  Reporter: What if there are other officials 
involved in this case? 
  Prasong: [Words indistinct]. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Money Laundering Law Is Needed"] </F>
  [Text] The call for a money laundering prevention law has 
drawn greater attention from the general public following the 
seizure of the property in the United States of a Thai MP who 
was accused of being involved in marijuana trafficking in that 
country. At present, Thailand has no law for the prevention of 
dirty money laundering, while such legislation has already been 
enforced in many countries, including by our neighbors, such as 
Singapore. The money laundering prevention law will enable the 
authorities to probe into the financial status of any suspicious 
persons to determine the sources of their money and related 
transactions. 
  As a matter of fact, the examination of assets and 
liabilities of suspected individuals is nothing new to Thailand. 
Following the previous coup, the then ruling National 
Peacekeeping Council issued a special order for the examination 
of assets of suspicious politicians. As a result, the people 
were informed of politicians who received gifts of checks and 
individuals who gave such gifts to them. This is another type 
of money laundering law once enforced in Thailand. But this 
peculiar measure was unacceptable in a democratic society 
because of its discriminatory enforcement. 
  Looked at from another angle, the money laundering law can 
also affect individual rights. However, if too much emphasis is 
placed on personal rights, the whole society can suffer adverse 
consequences. It is imperative that the state place the 
interests of the society over that of individuals. Without this 
law, it is feared that Thailand can become a haven of dirty 
money which is normally earned from narcotics trafficking, the 
contraband goods trade, and other illegal activities. 
  Financial institutions might find it hard to swallow if such 
a law is enforced. Their business and liquidity can be hampered 
should the money of their clients be ordered frozen pending 
official investigation. But they should consider the adverse 
consequences the country has to bear without this law. 
Switzerland was once labelled as one of the places where dirty 
money was deposited. 
  The current situation and present trends in the world and 
society have warranted a money laundering prevention law for 
Thailand. Hence, the authorities will be able to examine the 
money of suspicious individuals. Otherwise, Thailand will 
become a haven of dirty money from law breakers in the country 
as well as from unscrupulous individuals abroad. However, if 
the law makers themselves also have wounds on their backs that 
need covering, it is very likely that such legislation will 
never be promulgated.

<F P=106> ["This report is excerpted from a Bank of Thailand document </F>
presented by Charung Nukhwan, assistant governor of the Bank of 
Thailand to the seminar organized by the Faculty of Law of 
Chulalongkon University in September 1993"] 
  [Excerpts] Money laundering is a process of turning 
illegally- or unscrupulously-earned money into legal currency 
and preventing attempts to prove its illicit origin. Not only 
narcotics traffickers but also criminals have been engaging in 
money laundering activities to purify their money. 
  Money laundering techniques vary from country to country. 
One way to do money laundering is to keep tranferring money 
from one bank or financial institution to another until it is 
difficult to trace the origin of that money. 
  In some cases, the money is first sent to countries where 
laws strictly prohibit financial institutions from revealing the 
identity and personal information of their customers. Later, 
the money will be sent back home. By so doing, authorities will 
find it rather difficult to gather sufficient evidence to take 
any legal action against the owner of the money. 
<H5>  Different Patterns of Money Laundering </H5>
  (1) Illegally-earned money is spent as cash abroad. 
However, carrying a huge amount of cash travelling abroad is 
rather difficult and can trigger official suspicion. Some 
countries impose strict controls on cash transactions while 
financial systems in many countries are not conducive to cash 
transactions. Therefore, cash dealings are practical only in 
countries where regulations are lenient. Cash can also be sent 
out across the borders to other countries with assistance from 
corrupt officials. 
  (2) Depositing the money with financial institutions in the 
country is a common practice. Depositors normally use false 
names in their account books to protect their identities. This 
method is popular in countries where laws do not require the 
disclosure of identities of persons who make transactions or the 
specification of the value of each transaction. This legal 
shortcoming is conducive to using financial institutions to do 
money laundering. 
  (3) Depositing cash with commercial banks and financial 
institutions in other countries where laws on the control of the 
operations of banks and financial institutions are lenient so 
that the money will be included in those countries' monetary 
systems. After that, the money is transferred back to its 
owners, traffickers or criminals, through different means such 
as the wire transfer service. The money is now considered 
clean. This is a weakpoint of the countries which fail to 
enforce the law to strictly control cash outflows. 
  (4) Setting up a business or company is another tactics used 
by traffickers or criminals to conceal the source and ownership 
of their illicit money. They might either set up or purchase a 
company in a tax-free zone abroad. They then have their 
enterprises at home take out a loan or buy goods at exorbitant 
prices from their company in the foreign country so that the 
illegal money can be circulated between the two enterprises. 
  (5) Other methods of money laundering include purchasing 
cash-earning businesses which have been operating at a loss such 
as hotels, foreign exchange ventures, restaurants, retail shops, 
etc. The illicit money then is used to revive these businesses. 
The money is later siphoned out to do something else such as 
buying assignable commercial papers issued by financial 
institutions which assume no responsibility over any change of 
holders of the documents. 
  Moreover, advanced communications technologies in money 
transfer only emphasize quickness. Officials handling the 
transactions have no way of knowing their customers or the 
objectives of the transactions. This is another good 
alternative for money launderers to clean their dirty money. 
<H5>  Prevention And Suppression Of Money Laundering In Foreign </H5>
Countries. 
  FATF, Financial Action Task Force, is an international 
cooperation program established with U.S. assistance in 1989. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Money Laundering Prevention in Thailand. </H5>
  At present, Thailand is not a member of any international 
organization, nor has it concluded an agreement with any 
countries on money laundering prevention. There is not specific 
law dealing with this problem. Money laundering is not regarded 
as a criminal offense. Financial institutions have no 
particular measures against money laundering except those 
curbing the amount of money in domestic circulation and the 
risks borne by financial institutions in dealing with their 
clients. However, there are several rules and regulations which 
indirectly obstruct money laundering such as the control on cash 
inflow and outflow, the requirement for customers engaging in 
money transaction to reveal their identities, and the retention 
of transaction records. In fact, these are regular pratices of 
commercial banks. 
  Despite the lack of a secrecy law, it is the etiquette of 
financial institutions to keep the identities of their customers 
secret. 
<H5>  Suggestions: </H5>
  There are some shortcomings which can obstruct the 
introduction of a money laundering law. Here are some 
suggestions to overcome the problems. 
  (1) At the initial stage, a law must be promulgated to give 
legal immunity to commercial banks and financial institutions 
which release information about their customers who are 
suspected of doing money laundering. After a period of time, 
commercial banks and financial institutions are required to 
report to the authorities any irregularities, such as the 
transfer of a suspiciously high amount of money so that the 
latter can closely follow it up. 
  (2) Commercial banks and financial institutions must be 
required by law to know their customers in person and be 
prohibited from opening accounts for customers who use fake 
names or refuse to give their real names. Withdrawing or 
depositing huge amounts of cash, for example over 10 million 
baht, would require some written justification, which must be 
keep in the records for a period of time. Suspicious cases must 
be reported to authorities immediately. Commercial banks and 
financial institutions must work out an effective system for 
watching out for and following up any money laundering. 
  (3) A special working unit should be set up to investigate 
monetary offences, confiscate or impound property purchased with 
the money from drug trafficking and other criminal activities, 
and receive information from commercial banks and financial 
institutions for coordination with other agencies concerned. 
This unit can be established independently or under the 
jurisdiction of a ministry. 
  At present, Thailand is in the process of opening its 
financial market and relaxing regulations on the operations of 
financial institutions. New requirements for financial 
institutions in monitoring their customers and reporting to 
authorities can become obstacles to the implementation of the 
said liberal policy. Several countries, such as Singapore, have 
started enforcing this law. Therefore, Thailand can still wait 
to see the result first. 
  Laws and regulations on the control of operation of 
commercial banks and fiancial institutions in Asian countries 
are not much different. The enforcement of the money laundering 
legislation must be carried out step by step to ensure the 
country's maximum interest.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Time to clean up the dirty laundry"] </F>
  [Text] Last week in Taiwan, police broke up a heroin sales 
operation. The drugs were made in Burma, and sold in Taiwan by 
Singaporeans. The managers of the heroin ring were Hong Kong 
triad members who live in Thailand. Drugs entered Taiwan aboard 
ships of various nationality, sent mixed among other cargo by 
Bangkok transport agencies. Operations were masterminded across 
international satellite telephone connections, and profits were 
banked somewhere, although police are not yet sure where. This 
was, authorities point out, only a "small" smuggling operation 
responsible for dumping an estimated 50 kilograms of heroin per 
month on hapless addicts in Taiwan. 
  It is no wonder, then, that leaders of the international 
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) were in town last week 
pushing for new laws to combat drug smuggling. National police 
forces, up against an organized foe which is both sophisticated 
and ruthless, are losing the battle against addictive drugs. 
The international scope of the narcotics business is obvious. 
It is equally plain that drug traffickers only can be combated 
through international cooperation. Thailand must consider 
accepting the call of the world community to enact new, tough 
laws against money laundering. 
  FATF is a five-year-old group with a growing membership, 
funded by the G-7, of the world's second richest nations. It is 
mainly a lobbying group, formed to convince countries and 
bankers alike that it is in their own interest to monitor huge 
flows of cash. By watching where such money goes, FATF and its 
backers argue, big time drug dealers can be identified, 
investigated and ultimately put out of business. It is a 
compelling argument to beleaguered anti-narcotics agents. FATF 
President John Gieve told our officials it also should be 
attractive to the very people involved--our bankers. "A country 
or a center which wishes to attract the top names will find it 
easier to do so if they have in place anti-money laundering 
legislation," Mr Gieve said. 
  Some read this statement as a threat. But it is, instead, a 
promise. Cash transactions with banks are becoming ever more 
tightly controlled throughout the world. Even where banking is 
traditionally secretive and protective of the customer, such as 
in Switzerland, large transfers now are routinely reported to 
the police if the banks have any suspicion about their origin. 
Banks and nations which cooperate in anti-laundering efforts 
get more international business when they enter the financial 
centers. 
  Efforts to combat drugs kingpins have more and more targeted 
their fortunes. Sales of narcotics are performed with cash for a 
variety of reasons, just as most legitimate commerce is done 
more and more with paper. Warlords have assembled armies which 
outgun most police forces, but the bosses of the drug gangs must 
convert their profits. Money laundering is aimed at converting 
"dirty money" from drugs into "legitimate money," which then can 
be used for any purpose--even for buying entire governments. 
  Anti-laundering laws are the legal version of the famous 
Watergate maxim on how to catch villains: "Follow the money." A 
huge cash deposit may be attractive to a banker. But unless he 
knows the businessman making the deposit, money-laundering laws 
require him to report the transaction to authorities. This 
opens up a new line of inquiry to authorities. If written 
carefully and enforced without favor, such laws will not affect 
honest citizens, and will enhance the reputation of banks which 
participate. 
  Clearly, no inroads will be made against major drug 
trafficking without international cooperation and effort. 
Already, neighbors such as Australia, Japan Hong Kong and 
Singapore have passed tough anti-laundering laws, without harm 
to the business of their banks nor the privacy of their people. 
Unquestionably, the Government must consider such legislation 
carefully, and seek advice both from other countries and our own 
judicial experts before acting. But action on money-laundering 
must be taken soon. 
  Because Thailand is a front-line drugs state, the Government 
must take the responsibility of acting. Drug use already harms 
our country badly in many areas, from the spread of AIDS through 
massive corruption and countless petty crimes by desperate 
addicts. Because it is close to the production centers in Burma 
and Laos, Thailand also attracts major traffickers. Our 
country, and our banks, are healthy enough to reject drugs 
money. The Thai Government should take action to make the 
country increasingly unattractive for drug traffickers. A 
careful, but tough, anti-laundering law would mark a major step 
in such an effort.

  [Text] Zahedan (Sistan-Baluchestan), May 14, IRNA -- The 
8th Iran-Pakistan joint border commission opened here Saturday 
to explore problems and difficulties of the two countries' 
border provinces in countering bandits and drug smugglers. 
  Deputy chief minister of Pakistan's Baluchistan Province who 
is heading the delegation, Shirdel, praised Iran's law 
enforcement personnel for their decisive campaign against drug 
dealers. 
  Referring to Islamabad's attempts to eradicate narcotics and 
drug trafficking, he stressed that Pakistan does not produce any 
type of narcotics, and that these drugs are being mass produced 
in neighbouring Afghanistan and smuggled into his country. 
  According to him Pakistan is also serious in its fight 
against drug dealers despite its lack of proper facilities and 
equipment to deal with them on the long border it shares with 
Afghanistan. 
  Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan Province borders Pakistan's 
Baluchestan Province. 
  Head of the Iranian delegation, Vajihollah Aqa-Taqi who is 
in 
charge of security-political affairs at the governor-general's 
office of Sistan-Baluchestan Province, said Iran will spare no 
efforts in promotion of economic links between the neighbouring 
provinces. 
  He assured that Iran will seriously deal with all activities 
against Pakistan at the joint borders and will never let border 
be a base for subversion inside Pakistan. 
  He stressed that Iran expects reciprocal treatment from 
Pakistan and particularly officials in charge of Baluchistan 
Province in this regard. 
  Outlining Iran's success in the drug campaign, Aqa-Taqi 
announced that the law enforcement personnels have seized over 
10 tons of narcotics in the border regions during the first 
month of the Iranian calendar Farvardin which ended on April 20. 
Iran-Pakistan joint border commission which is being held bi- 
annually will last 3 days.

<F P=106> [Edward Gorman report: "Afghan Exiles Return to Reap Heroin </F>
Profits"] 
  [Text] Kabul -- Continuing civil war and anarchy in 
Afghanistan are causing a huge increase in the production of 
heroin, much of which is heading towards Europe. 
  Aid officials and Western diplomats in Islamabad, the 
Pakistani capital believe that the amount of land in Afghanistan 
under poppy cultivation has increased by more than 50 per cent 
since 1990. 
  They see it as a long-term crisis facing Europe and believe 
that the production boom is a consequence of hard-pressed 
refugees returning from Pakistan and Iran to broken villages 
short of cash and opting for the most profitable crop where once 
mainly wheat and maize were grown. 
  One Western envoy said: "What I find frightening is that at 
the moment people are making money out of it, but when the `Mr 
Bigs' realise there are serious profits to be made there will be 
an explosion of drug trafficking from this region. We are just 
seeing the tip of the iceberg." 
  Most of the poppies are being grown in the eastern and 
southern provinces of Afghanistan--areas which suffered the 
worst destruction during the ten-year Soviet occupation. 
Figures are difficult to get, but in some areas of Nangarhar 
province, around Jalalabad, for example, aid officials estimate 
that 98 per cent of the cultivated land is under poppy. United 
Nations estimates for total opium production nationally from 
1990 to 1992, even before production started to rise 
dramatically, show an increase from 415 ton's to 640. 
  The problem for the West is that with no effective central 
government in Afghanistan, it is difficult to put in place 
adequate drug control programmes. Many of the areas under 
cultivation are inaccessible due to general brigandry and 
lawlessness, while the civil war is causing rampant inflation 
and unemployment, which is making life difficult for returning 
refugees. 
  In the eastern provinces, the situation is compounded by 
what 
Western observers see as the failure of the Pakistani 
authorities to crack down on the thousands of heroin 
laboratories and smugglers operating in the tribal areas of the 
North-West Frontier province. Some suspect corruption within the 
Pakistan establishment at a high level. 
  Another aspect of the problem is that smuggling routes have 
proliferated since the Soviet war. While most of the heroin 
probably continues to be exported through Pakistan, which has an 
estimated 1.5 million addicted to the drug, other routes include 
the north, through Badakshan province, into Tajikistan and up to 
Moscow and into Europe; north into Uzbekistan or through Herat 
into Turkmenistan; west through Iran into Turkey; or south to 
the Makran coast for shipping to Dubai. Anthony Fitzherbert, 
programme co-ordinator for the Food and Agriculture Organisation 
farming rehabilitation project in Afghanistan, believes that 
once farmers get used to growing poppies it will be difficult to 
stop them. "It'll grow at the same rate as the market in the 
West," he said. "The Afghans are not going to produce a 
surplus--they are going to produce for the market. 
  Andrew Pryce, project manager for the UN Drug Control 
Programme based in Peshawar, cautions against scaremongering. 
"A lot of it is conjecture. If one does nothing about it, it 
is going to grow. When we are able to do something about it, we 
can bring alternatives to it and kill it," he said. 
  One difficulty is impressing on the Afghans that heroin is 
bad news for everybody. In the village of Khushgumbat near 
Jalalabad where this year's harvest is under way, a village 
elder responded defiantly to criticism of poppy growing. "Why 
are you manufacturing weapons and sending them here where they 
will kill people? The problem is that we have less land and we 
have to live and feed our families. There is nothing else to 
compare with the poppy yield. The people who buy it from us take 
it abroad--that is their business."

  [Text] Bombay, March 31--The narcotics cell of the Bombay 
police last week seized a massive factory manufacturing 
methaqualone from which the drug Mandrax is made. 
  This is the first time in India that such a large 
methaqualone factory has been seized, although experts believe 
that India is the largest producer of Mandrax. 
  According to the chief of the narcotics cell, DCP [Deputy 
Commissioner of Police] Rahul Sur, Mandrax tablets and 
methaqualone powder each weighing 100 kg and collectively valued 
at Rs 20 lakhs were seized from the factory along with a Maruti 
car. 
  The factory, masquerading as Ambala Organic Chemicals Pvt 
Ltd 
in an industrial estate in Kadhi, Mehsana district, Gujarat, was 
spread over 10,000 sq feet and had five boilers 12-feet high. It 
is believed to have been in operation for the past nine months. 
  Six persons were arrested in this connection: Nitin Khimji 
Bhanushali (33) of Neelam Nagar, Mulund; Nayan Jetha Bhimji 
Bhanushali (28) of Sarvodaya Nagar, Mulund; Harish Kantibhai 
Patel (35) of Nadiad, Gujarat, and Manehdra Singh Sandhu (41), 
Kinit Jayantilal Amin (33), Amit Jayantibhai Patel (26), all of 
Ahmedabad. 
  However, Prem Shetty, one of the biggest manufacturers of 
Mandrax tablets in India, who had advanced the money through 
hawala for the purchse of the factory, is believed to have fled 
India.

<F P=106> [Article by Anindya Sengupta: "Opium Cultivation Flourishes </F>
in Districts Despite Strictures"; first paragraph STATESMAN 
comment] 
  [Text] While cultivation of opium poppy seems to be largely 
concentrated in Bankura, Nadia and North-24 Parganas are not far 
behind. 
  Despite strict penal provisions incorporated in the Narcotic 
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, illegal cultivation 
of opium poppy and cannabis continue to flourish in large parts 
of Bankura, Burdwan, Purulia, Birbhum, Nadia, and the North-24 
Parganas. 
  While cultivation of opium poppy seems to be largely 
concentrated in Bankura, the districts of Nadia and the North-24 
Parganas happen to have the largest concentration of cannabis 
cultivation as detected by the State Excise Department. 
  The minimum punishment for cultivation of opium poppy is a 
rigorous imprisonment of 10 years, extendable to 20 years. 
According to the Excise officials, villagers seem to care less 
about legal consequences and desperately indulge in the act, 
which yield opium and from which morphine is derived and 
finally, of course, the deadly heroin. 
  Although opium poppy had an edible use through one of its 
by-products, popularly known as posto cultivation of 
the same was potentially more dangerous than cannabis, whose 
derivatives were charas and hashish, said an official of the 
State Excise Department. 
  Statistics speak volumes about this growing and dangerous 
trend among villagers, who according to the Excise officials, 
find it more reasonable and lucrative to cultivate opium poppy 
and cannabis. 
  Excise officials feel that whereas the cultivation of opium 
poppy is less costly than that of other cash crops, the return 
is more rewarding. This could be one of the reasons for 
widespread cultivation of the same, said an official. 
  According to the Excise Department, several bighas of land 
are being utilised for this purpose. 
  The figures available from the department, say nearly 285 
acres of land was found to be under cultivation of opium poppy 
plants in the district of Bankura alone, which happens to be the 
prime area of such cultivation in West Bengal. 
  This detection was only for the financial year 1993-94, 
where 
the estimated number of poppy capsules was about a crore. In the 
same financial year, the Excise Department detected opium poppy 
cultivation in about 20 acres of land under the Kaksa thana area 
in the Burdwan district also. 
  Regarding cannabis, the Department found 20 bighas and 31 
acres under such cultivation in two separate raids in Nadia in 
March this year. The given area had an estimated yield of about 
4,870 kg of cannabis. 
  While there was no definite proof of the manufacture of 
opium 
despite a noticeable rise in the cultivation of opium poppy 
plants as admitted by the Narcotics cell of the State Excise 
Department, officials felt that a popular by-product of opium 
poppy, posto meant for edible use could have been a 
major reason for its widespread cultivation. 
  The price of posto, which had gone up 
significantly in the past few years, could have prompted 
villagers to go for large scale cultivation with fertile soil 
and adequate irrigation facilities, said a senior official of 
the Department. 
  However, the Excise Department seems to be determined to 
arrest this growing trend in several districts of the State. On 
conditions of anonymity an official of the Department said, a 
series of raids would be conducted in different districts 
including, Bankura and Nadia in the current financial year, 
based on specific information received by the Department. 
  When asked about the extent of cooperation received from the 
villagers the official said in most of the cases instead of 
cooperation it was tough resistance, which at times virtually 
snowballed into a confrontation between the Excise people and 
the villagers. 
  According to the Excise Department, cannabis was available 
at 
retail outlets and sold without restrictions till December 12, 
1989, the cut-off date as decided at the UN's single convention 
on Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in 1961 to which India was 
a signatory. 
  It was decided at this convention that the signatory 
countries would stop non-medicinal and non-scientific use of 
cannabis within stipulated time frame. Hence, from 13 December, 
1989 both cultivation and sale of cannabis became illegal.

  [Text] In its attempt to check illicit opium cultivation in 
Meghalaya, where this practice is the most prevalent among all 
the seven north-eastern States, a team of officials of the 
Narcotics Control Bureau, Eastern Region, recently raided Badak 
village in the Mariyang circle of east Siang district. 
  They destroyed more than 400,000 of opium plants. The NCB 
[Narcotics Control Board] team, assisted by CRPF [Central 
Reserve Police Force] jawans, set on fire the plants spread over 
30 plots on April 4, said Mr S. Nag, assistant director of the 
Bureau, in Calcutta on Monday. 
  According to the Union Finance Ministry sources, opium 
cultivation is rampant in east Siang and Lohit districts of 
Arunachal Pradesh for quite some time. 
  Apart from opium, another alarming trend is the massive 
cultivation of high-quality ganja in the Ukhrul and Senapati 
districts of Manipur which fetches Rs 1,500 and above a kg. 
  A major haul of about 1.5 tons of Manipur ganja in Calcutta 
in December last by the NCB is an eye-opener.

  [Text] Bombay, April 13--Mr A.V. Potdar, designated judge 
dealing with cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic 
Substances Act, has acquitted a Nigerian national who was 
accused of being in possession of over 16 kg of brown sugar on 
the ground that there were discrepancies in the police version 
and that the prosecution had not been able to prove its case. 
  Bernard Ugochukwa Acaribe was arrested at Bombay Central 
railway station at about 3.30 p.m. on April 6, 1989. The police 
said he was carrying a big suitcase in which were 18 Samsonite 
rexin handbags containing brown sugar. Samples of the brown 
powder were sent to the chemical analyser who confirmed that it 
was a crude form of heroin. 
  The accused was arrested and was subsequently charge-sheeted 
on January 27, 1994. He was brought to trial before Judge 
Potdar. Before the trial commenced, however, the drug allegedly 
seized from the Nigerian was destroyed in keeping with the 
provisions of section 52 of the Act. The accused told the court 
that he had been falsely implicated in the case. 
  He alleged that he had not been arrested at Bombay Central 
station at all and that he had, in fact, been picked up at 
Marine Drive area on April 6, 1989. He said that the drugs were 
not found on him and that the suitcase and its contents were 
planted on him. Judge Potdar recorded in his order that it was 
difficult to believe that the Nigerian was guilty of the offence 
alleged against him since there were material discrepancies 
between the evidence given by police officers and a panch 
witness. 
  The judge also found fault with the chemical analyser's 
report since it did not mention the per cent of the drug in the 
brown powder that was seized. While one police officer, Mr 
Bagwan, told the court that he did not remember how the suitcase 
was opened, another officer, Mr Birje, stated that it had a 
combination lock. However, the panch witness testified that the 
accused opened the bag with a key. All the three were part of 
the raiding party that arrested the Nigerian. 
  While one of the police officers told the court that the 
samples to be sent to the analyser were collected in polythene 
bags, the panch witness said that they were collected in paper 
envelopes. Judge Potdar mentioned that both the officers and the 
panch witness were present at the time the accused was accosted. 
The order also recorded that there were discrepancies in the 
weight of the 18 packets as mentioned by the police in different 
records. 
  The judge pointed out that the panch witness differed with 
the police officers with regard to the colour of the powder 
seized, the mode in which the samples were packed and the manner 
in which the suitcase was opened. Judge Potdar agreed that a 
person could be convicted merely on the testimony of police 
officers if the panch witness turned hostile. But in such a 
case, the evidence of the officers had to be unimpeachable. 
  Mr V.I. Panwani appeared for the state of Maharashtra. Mr 
Ravi Gurnani, Mr P.S. Hingorani and Mr Ayas R. Khan represented 
the accused.

<F P=106> [Article by Chowdhery M. A. Sheed: "Drugs: An Major Problem"] </F>
  [Text] The UN officials working to control drugs have 
announced that Afghanistan has become the largest producer of 
heroin in the world. This situation has affected Afghanistan 
also. The UN officials believe that 15 percent of the Afghan 
population is addicted to drugs. A BBC correspondent reported 
that according to UN officials Afghanistan produces 2,000 tons 
opium annually. Almost all of this heroin goes to European 
nations. The opium producing region in Iran and Pakistan, known 
as the Golden Crescent, is the largest producer of opium in the 
world. Until recently, the area in Laos and Myanmar was known as 
the Golden Crescent and produced most opium in the world. Each 
year, hashish fields in Afghanistan are photographed from 
satellites and estimated figures are prepared based on these 
photographs. The estimates so far are based on the sources from 
Afghanistan as foreigners are not permitted to travel in 
Afghanistan due to war. According to information available, they 
are growing opium in areas where they did not grow in the past 
to meet the expenses of preparing land. The refugees who had 
returned after 14 years of war have also made growing opium 
their occupation because this is the best way to make a lot of 
money in short period of time. Opium is being grown for the 
first time in Sangarmar near Pakistani border and in Kandhar and 
Herat west of it. In the past, opium was grown mostly in 
Badkhshan in the northern region. A UN drug control official in 
Kabul said that it was not possible to impose any law because of 
war. He said that he did not hesitate in saying that no 
government in this region has taken any steps to control this 
affliction to protect the people from this curse forever. It is 
a proven fact that drugs are prepared in tribal areas in 
Pakistan, however, this ugly trade is not limited to Pakistan 
only. China, Malaysia, and Singapore are also active in this 
trade. In Sichuan, a northern province, a restaurant is known 
for some special delicacies. This restaurant became very crowded 
when it introduced a new dish called "Chindo hot pot." This 
restaurant offers four traditional Chinese dishes with its own 
special spices. According to SHANGHAI EVENING NEWS, the health 
department and the police became suspicious seeing such 
popularity of this dish. This dish and the spices and ingredient 
used in it were analyzed in a laboratory. The laboratory 
indicated use of an addictive drug in this dish. Detailed 
analyses revealed use of opium in this dish. It should be known 
that this Chinese border province is notorious for drug 
smuggling. It is fortunate that the Chinese government has 
strengthened its campaign against drug abuse. According to CHINA 
DAILY, 82.6 kilograms of drugs were confiscated during this 
year. This is a 56 percent increase over the last year. Most of 
the action was taken in southwestern provinces that share border 
with Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos. Most of world's hashish and 
heroin was produced in this region. In the Chinese province of 
Xingxia, there are dozens of laboratories on the border that 
manufacture Number 4 heroin known as China White around the 
world. This is the purest heroin and extremely lethal. If we 
shed light on the evil drug trade in connection with Singapore, 
we will find that drugs here are smuggled from its neighbor 
Malaysia. About two to four kilogram heroin is smuggled each 
week. According to one magazine report, six persons including a 
16 year old girl, were accused of selling heroin. The narcotics 
authorities said that this girl was the youngest among the drug 
dealers arrested until now. These people were arrested by the 
Central Narcotics Bureau officials after a two-day operation. 
They had recovered two kilograms heroin worth 800,000 Singapore 
dollars. According to Singapore laws, any person caught with 15 
kilograms of heroin can be sentenced to death However, this 
sentence is applied only to persons above 18 years of age. The 
president has discretionary powers for punishing persons below 
the age of 18. The Central Narcotics Bureau officials said that 
heroin to Singapore is smuggled via Malaysia. The magazine 
further wrote that the Singapore High Court has given death 
sentence to a person for smuggling heroin. Phatak Sao, 32 years 
old, had committed this crime in August 1990. Thirty-eight grams 
of heroin was recovered from his person. The court was told that 
10 packets of heroin were recovered from the accused. Later, he 
took the police officers to his flat where they found a machine 
for making packets. Any person with more than 15 grams of heroin 
in Singapore can be sentenced to death. After this death 
sentence was announced in the middle of the 1970's, 40 persons 
including some foreigners have been hanged for this crime. As 
this writer mentioned in the beginning of this article, no 
government has taken any effective step to eradicate this ugly 
trade. It is expected that this evil and ugly trade will be 
abolished now. Drugs are seized from almost all the tribal 
areas. This proves two facts. One, the center of producing and 
smuggling heroin is still in tribal areas and this wicked trade 
could not be stopped despite government's efforts. Second, 
despite the government's announcement of exemplary punishments 
for drug dealers, the drug mafia is still very active. 
Therefore, the government must implement the punishments that it 
has announced. The mere announcement of these punishments will 
not stop the smugglers from these activities. The ultra modern 
equipment that the smugglers have procured can be estimated by 
the fact that they own very expensive cars and mobile 
telephones. It is very difficult to arrest these smugglers 
because of their secret and effective communication system. We 
need organized efforts against these drug smugglers. 
  It is fortunate that according to an agreement between 
Pakistan and the United States, the latter will provide $3.5 
million in additional aid to Pakistan for drug control 
activities. This aid is in addition to the aid that the United 
States gives to Pakistan through other economic agencies. 
Pakistan received economic aid from many countries including the 
United States for controlling drugs. However, we can say with 
confidence that this aid was not used properly. 
Misappropriations on a large scale were committed. We have heard 
very embarrassing scandals related to the millions of dollars of 
U.S. aid being used for helping the poppy farmers in Gadun. The 
prominent people involved in drug trade and important officials 
in drug control agencies are working together to find new ways o 
smuggle drugs. Some extremely powerful persons with close 
contacts with the government are not only involved in this ugly 
trade but also protect drug smugglers. The lists of such 
influential persons that the United States and Saudi Arabia had 
given to Pakistan prove this claim. The major reasons why drug 
smuggling has not been controlled is the abuse of foreign aid 
for drug control and the silence of our government over the 
involvement of influential people in this trade. The Western 
nations do not give this economic aid to control drugs because 
of their sympathy for us. The United States and other Western 
nations provide this aid to protect their people there from this 
curse because smugglers go directly to these countries as the 
drugs are expensive. It is the result of our failure that one 
reason for declaring Pakistan a terrorist nation [as published] 
was its government's patronizing of drug smugglers. All these 
reasons not withstanding, the production and smuggling of drugs 
is a terrible crime from humanity perspective alone. This trade 
should be discouraged at every level because the drug smugglers 
earn billions and as newly rich people corrupt the society. In 
addition, they are guilty of ruining health of the people in 
their own country when they sell it there. Hundreds of thousands 
of families have been ruined. What is necessary is to make sure 
that the money the United States provides to Pakistan for 
controlling drugs is used appropriately. A plan must be 
implemented to stop the large-scale misappropriations and 
stealing so that practical steps can be taken to uproot the 
curse of drug abuse.

  [Text] Kohat (MASHRIQ Correspondent)--The Kohat police has 
foiled an attempt to smuggle drugs worth millions of rupees in a 
car with fake military license plates. They arrested one person

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jumma Khan: "Drug Money is Being Invested in </F>
National Commerce and Industry"] 
  [Text] According to the latest news Pakistan, Afghanistan, 
and India are the first, second, and third countries 
respectively in drug production, abuse, and smuggling in the 
whole world. 
  Mr. Giorgio Giacomelli, executive director of the UN 
International Drug Control Program, is visiting Pakistan these 
days. He addressed a press conference in the UN drug control 
office in Karachi on Thursday and presented some facts and 
figures on which one cannot but express remorse. 
  Mr. Giacomelli said that the number of drug addicts in the 
world was three million. Half of them live in Pakistan! Pakistan 
is not a very important drug producer, but drug abuse has 
reached dangerous proportions here. According to Mr. 
Giacomelli's records Pakistan produces 150 ton heroin and opium 
annually. In Afghanistan, this amount has reached between 1,000 
to 3000 tons. About 50,000 acres of land is used for growing 
drug crops in Afghanistan. He explained that this was due to the 
war raging in Afghanistan for about a decade. The United States 
could not implement its drug control program because of it. This 
has led to an increase in drug production, abuse, and smuggling 
in Afghanistan. 
  The UN facts and figures have their own place, and we have 
analyzed this problem more than once in this column. It is 
surprising that an organization like the United Nations bases 
its conclusions only on the magic of numbers. Why doesn't it 
discuss the activities that give birth to these numbers? For 
example, I had explained in detail in this column how the 
production, use, and smuggling of drugs was on the rise in 
Pakistan, and also that it was an extension of the increasing 
production in Afghanistan. The war and civil war over two 
decades in Afghanistan had opened the Afghan border for free 
movement of the Mujaheddin. This helped drug dealers to 
successfully transfer their business to Pakistan. Since the 
United States had no objection to it at that time, this business 
continued to flourish. Now that the U.S. interests in 
Afghanistan have been served, it is continuously expressing its 
dissatisfaction over Pakistan's increasing drug trade. At that 
time when Pakistan had formed a blind policy on Afghanistan, did 
not the United States know of the frightening outcome of this 
trade? You can imagine how explosive this situation is by the 
fact that when Pakistani government decided to limit the 
movement on Afghanistan-Pakistan border and to close the border, 
a situation was created that the government had to reverse its 
decision. It is not difficult to estimate how long the hand of 
the drug mafia is. Abduction of foreigners and government 
officials is a common occurrence in Balochistan, Sarhad, and 
Sindh. 
  The people of Balochistan, Sarhad, and Sindh are hostages of 
the drug mafia. Terrorism and abductions are part of the same 
story. It is deplorable that the law enforcement agencies know 
these facts and, instead of taking action against the drug mafia 
or making the Pakistan-Afghanistan border safer, they are taking 
action against the peaceful citizens. This is not a secret that 
no one is aware of. 
  At one time, Afghan citizens came to India for business, and 
they were still viewed with suspicion. At present, a lot of 
Afghans have Pakistani passports or identity cards and are 
giving a bad name to Pakistan all over the world. This has 
brought Pakistan to the top of the list of nations involved in 
drug smuggling. Is it not the responsibility of these 
organizations to record the fact that Pakistan got this curse 
during the war while protecting U.S. interests in Afghanistan 
without regard to the country and its people being destroyed? 
  A U.S. deputy secretary of state recently lamented that drug 
money has penetrated Pakistani politics. However, this situation 
was created by the U.S. government. Mr. Giacomelli states that 
40 percent of Pakistan's GDP is drug money. This can be fatal to 
any economy. He said that commerce and industry in Pakistan were 
going into the hands of drug smugglers, therefore, Pakistani 
government should be alert about them. He emphasized the need 
for law enforcement and said that law enforcement agencies must 
be made more effective. 
  The effectiveness of law enforcement agencies is contingent 
upon their diligence. There is no guarantee that they will not 
be effected by the "glamour." In the present situation of our 
law enforcement agencies, any legal action will be useless. But, 
what does Mr. Giacomelli know! 
  Mr. Giacomelli knows that 25 percent of Pakistan's raw 
material production last year was from drug money, and this had 
doubled to 50 percent in one year. 
  Still, Mr. Giacomelli does not want to debate the "why" of 
this situation. Perhaps, he does not want to raise this issue on 
purpose. However, it cannot be left alone. 
  We have to first determine which people of which group have 
what benefits associated with this business. Until this basic 
fact is determined, no drug program can be successful. This 
subject is extremely difficult, but we have to discuss it one 
day. 
  Mr. Giacomelli informed us that the United Nations and its 
agency is planning to start a program in cooperation with Iran 
and Pakistan to reduce drug production in South Asia and to stop 
drug smuggling from this region to the West. This program will 
cost three million dollars. Iran will contribute $20 million 
while the United Nations and Pakistan will contribute $5 million 
each. 
  Mr. Giacomelli while explaining details of his meetings with 
the prime minister and the president said that Pakistan was very 
troubled by this drug situation and is willing to cooperate with 
the United Nations. However, he said that if Pakistan's 
industry, commerce, and politics were fully controlled by the 
drug Mafia, there will be extremely dangerous results and 
Pakistan's economy will be destroyed. 
  If we look at our national politics in the context of drugs, 
do we not see the bitter fact that youthful, strong, and active 
forces of our society have been made helpless and innocent 
people who are being left at the mercy of the drug mafia? No 
village or city is safe from the terrorists. Is it not pathetic 
that the forces that can stand firm against the drug mafia are 
being pushed forcibly against the wall? The forces that can be 
used against the anti-social elements, terrorists, and drug 
dealers, are being murdered by the hands of those who are 
supposed to enforce laws. The question is: Who has invested in 
what part of this trade? Why are these operations and fake 
campaigns of the drug enforcement agencies so aberrant.

  [Text] The chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement 
Agency, NDLEA, Brigadier General Musa Bamayi, has said that the 
agency will not spare anybody in redeeming the nation's image 
abroad, even if it means getting rid of staff or disbanding the 
agency. Brig. Gen. Musa Bamayi stated this at a press 
conference held at the Kano state office of the agency. He 
brought along with him 82 retrenchment letters and three of 
dismissal for the staff of the Kano agency, and he supervised 
the distribution of the letters at the news briefing. He 
explained that findings in the last three months in the Kano 
office of the NDLEA have shown that staff of the agency have 
tremendously betrayed the confidence reposed on them by 
Nigerians. 
  NTA Kano correspondent Hamisu Rogo reports that Brig. Gen. 
Bamayi revealed that some claims by the international community 
that some officials of the NDLEA cooperate with drug barons are 
genuine, and that those retrenched have been found to be 
involved in some way or another with drug barons at the airport. 
The three dismissed officials were found to have been involved 
in acts capable of perverting the course of justice. The 
chairman said the NDLEA is ready to [words indistinct].

  [Excerpt] The government has launched a campaign to deal 
with drug traffickers, with effect from today, and has called on 
Tanzanians to expose all those involved in drug trafficking. 
Addressing Mlandizi residents in Kibaha District, the deputy 
prime minister and minister for home affairs, the Honorable 
Mrema, said that the government had resolved to launch the 
campaign when it realized that Tanzania had now been turned into 
a transit point for drugs. The Honorable Mrema stated that the 
government would reward those who expose drug traffickers. 
However, he did not specify the amount to be paid to those who 
would assist the government in arresting the traffickers. He 
pointed out that, after five or 10 years, Tanzania would have 
many mentally destabilized youth as a result of drug abuse.

  [Text] Prague, May 13 (CTK) -- Guidelines for the money 
laundering bill will be presented for discussion within a 
fortnight, Justice Minister Jiri Novak told reporters today 
after his meeting with Swiss Justice and Police Minister Arnold 
Koller. 
  Novak said Koller told him about the Swiss legislation on 
the 
matter and offered help in drawing up the bill. 
  Koller said the extension of Swiss legislation includes a 
definition of organized crime and streamlining the confiscation 
of the organized gang members' property. Banks are allowed to 
alert the state attorney or the police when spotting suspect 
banking operations. 
  Koller, who designed the Swiss money laundering law, also 
said that the worldwide yearly return on drug trafficking 
amounted to $120 million, which he said was a reason for 
democratic countries to join in the fight against money 
laundering. 
  The law has not been late in coming, Novak said. The 
developed European countries have only introduced it recently 
and among the post-communist countries only Hungary has a 
similar law, he said. 
  The Swiss have launched a limited project enabling 50 drug 
addicts to have controlled access to free drugs, Koller said. 
  If former deputy chairman of the bankrupt Czech bank Banka 
Bohemia Jiri Cadek, now on the run and reputedly considering 
seeking asylum in Switzerland, is detained by the Swiss police, 
he will be extradited to the Czech Republic, Koller said.

  [Text] Warsaw (DPA) -- Polish customs officials have 
caught drug smugglers with 40 kg of heroin at the German-Polish 
border crossing of Olszyna near Forst. It has become known only 
now that some Poles last week tried to smuggle the "hot" stuff 
to Germany in a private car. In Slubice--the Polish part of 
Frankfurt/Oder--a Vietnamese was apprehended who was trying to 
take opium hidden in cotton shirts into the Federal Republic. 
The public prosecutors said on 19 May that he had 600 shirts 
with him, decorated with a beer mug design. Underneath this, 
little bags with an amber liquid containing opium were sewn in.

  [Text] In the last few days, the Balkan routes of the drug 
traffickers have received a new blow from the Romanian police, 
which discovered and confiscated 112 kg of pure heroin from 
Turkey, whose final destination was an address in Germany. The 
112 kg of heroin is the largest such bust on the territory of 
our country. The drug was contained in one kg bags hidden in a 
special container inside a bus driving on the Turkey-Germany 
route. In order to find the hiding place, the whole bus had to 
be taken apart piece by piece. It appears that the head of the 
network of traffickers was a known figure in the Spanish 
underworld. It is worth mentioning that the bus with the 112 kg 
of heroin managed to cross the border; the drugs were discovered 
and seized in Bucharest.

  [Excerpt] Bucharest ROMPRES, 17/5/1994 -- [passage 
omitted] At a press conference held on 16 May, General Ion 
Pitulescu, head of the General Police Inspectorate [IGP], named 
a number of points scored against crime syndicates by the 
Romanian police. Listed among them are the capture of 112 
kilograms of pure heroin, seen as a new blow given to the Balkan 
drug connection, for the head of which, now in Spain, the 
Romanian police will demand extradition. Another success was the 
seizure on 23 April, jointly with the German police, of 55 
kilograms of heroin and the apprehension of two persons in 
Turkey, one in Germany, and two in Romania. On 11 May the 
Syrian citizen Muhammad Khalal was caught while selling one 
kilogram of pure heroin worth $30,000. The cooperation with the 
German and Dutch police forces made possible the dismantling of 
another connection that used to operate on the route Constanta- 
Bucuresti-Arad-Netherlands, which trafficked 6,000 kilograms of 
hashish. In collaboration with the Chinese police, 10 criminals 
were caught, all involved in two sadistic assassinations and 
assaults. The same gang is suspected of having killed a fellow 
citizen and of having then disposed of his body by chopping it 
in a concrete-mixer, which they subsequently dismantled and had 
its parts dispersed. Another case regards four groups of 
racketeers from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) 
reported to have committed several robberies against tourist 
groups. The latest remarkable feat is the capturing of a 
12-person gang involved in the stealing and trafficking of 30 
million lei worth of electrolytic copper from Zlatna, and of 20 
million lei worth of gold-bearing mud. Implicated in this 
affair is, as General Pitulescu said, the "Emperor of Gypsies 
Everywhere, Iulian I." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 16/5/1994 -- The Bucharest 
Court heard in the 16 May public session a part of the 
defendants in the trial of the Dogmanov group standing charges 
of drug traffic, forgery and use of forgery and traffic of 
weapons and ammunition. The defendants, two of whom are 
Colombian citizens, explained how they got acquainted abroad and 
started the drug traffic connection. They managed as early as 
1990 to bring several consignments of drugs in Romania, using, 
among other things a marble table and 21 pictures. The last 
consignment, containing about 100 kg cocaine, was concealed in 
the pedestals of two statutes. The Romanian police managed to 
trace them and arrested the whole connection, led by Romanian 
Alexandru Sava Dogmanov. The defendants heard by the court 
today pleaded guilty of a part of the offenses.

<F P=106> [Article signed MMA/MJN: "International Heroin Trafficking: </F>
Major Chinese Network Uncovered"] 
  [Text] Liege, 19 May (BELGA) -- An investigation carried 
out by the BSR [Special Research Force] in Liege and the police 
forces in Luxembourg and the Netherlands has succeeded in 
uncovering a major "Chinese" network for running heroin into 
several European countries. The Liege police apprehended a 
41-year-old Croat, Nemad Lukic, a Luxembourg resident, in 
possession of two kg of heroin. A further three arrests were 
carried out in Maastricht by the Netherlands police. The three 
persons concerned are currently being held in the Netherlands 
with a view to being extradited to Belgium, as requested by the 
Public Prosecutor's Office in Liege. The arrested individuals 
comprise one 39-year-old Maltese called Wooi Kok Geok, a 
43-year-old Indonesian named Hadi Kesuma Bn Djimin, and a 
43-year-old Chinese called Kuang Jeniy-Zhou. Finally, a 
businessman of Chinese origin, considered to be at the hub of 
heroin trafficking in Europe, was arrested in Luxembourg. 
  The first four individuals arrested had been under close 
surveillance by various police units. Recently they met in 
Maastricht where Lukic took delivery of 2.15 kg of heroin. The 
moment he received the package, Lukic was unwittingly followed 
by police belonging to the Liege BSR branch, who then followed 
him to the Post House Hotel by the Liege-Herstal freeway. 
  There Lukic was caught in possession of the drug, which 
turned out to be a Chinese variety of heroin, 80 percent pure, 
according to analyses carried out in a specialised laboratory at 
Liege University. 
  When interrogated by the police, Lukic denied all the facts 
although he had been caught in possession of the drug. A 
warrant for his arrest was issued by the Public Prosecutor's 
Office in Liege and he was then locked up in Lantin prison. 
  Two of the three individuals apprehended in the Netherlands 
were in possession of firearms. 
  In Luxembourg, the investigation also led to the arrest of a 
41-year-old Chinese trader named Wong Suk Yin, who is considered 
to be the key person for reselling heroin in several European 
countries. Wong Suk Yin told his investigators that he could 
regularly provide 10 kg of heroin of the same quality as that 
seized in Herstal. The confiscated heroin, which still had to 
be "blended" before being sold, because its purity made it 
potentially lethal if consumed in that form, had a market value 
of approximately 100 million Belgian francs. Various police 
departments are continuing their inquiry.

determine a strategy for the Twelve to combat drugs, with a 
budget of 906,000 contos. 
  "We are here today to take a decisive step toward the 
practical implementation of a major project of the European 
Union." This was the opening statement made by Marques Mendes to 
the 16 members of the OEDT board of administration: 12 from the 
member states, two from the European Commission, and two 
specialists designated by the European Parliament. 
  In his official speech, the deputy minister greeted those 
present in the name of the government, guaranteeing Portugal's 
"total commitment and its best effort" in support of the 
observatory's installation: a task that he wished to be "rapid." 
  Marques Mendes stressed the fact that, "Combating the 
scourge 
of drugs and drug addiction requires determination, cooperation, 
and solidarity." He gave a reminder that, "It is impossible to 
do effective work based on mere amateurism." 
  As for the informational role that this observatory will 
assume in the future, that member of the government claimed that 
"paths for cooperation" are being opened for action on a 
European scale, which could result in "more effective 
intervention." 
<H5>  Two Candidates for Future Director </H5>
  At yesterday's meeting, the first convened by the OEDT board 
of administration, and held at the Belem Cultural Center, the 
members debated topics related to the start-up of this first 
Community agency with headquarters in Portugal. They discussed 
the organization of internal regulations, the selection of a 
president, and various possibilities concerning the 
observatory's installation. 
  The session was chaired by Vanden Abeele, the Commission's 
general director for budget, who, during a brief press 
conference, announced that the observatory's budget for this 
year will be 4.6 million ecus [European currency units], nearly 
906,000 contos. He commented: "However, only half of that sum 
has been made available." 
  The second meeting will take place before the end of July, 
at 
which time a director will be designated, as well as a genuine 
work program. The profile of the future director was debated 
yesterday, with emphasis on two candidates: Father Feytor Pinto, 
the high commissioner for Project Life, and George Stievenard, 
in charge of the Drug Department of the Commission of European 
Communities' Secretariat General. DN [DIARIO DE NOTICIAS] 
published an interview with the latter yesterday. 
  According to the regulations establishing the OEDT, its 
purpose is to provide objective, reliable, and comparable 
reports, on the European level, regarding drugs and their 
respective consequences, not only from the social and health 
standpoint, but also from that of trafficking and repression. 
  However, the observatory cannot adopt any measure extending 
beyond the specific realm of information and respective 
treatment. It has a computerized network available, establishing 
the infrastructure for collection and exchange of information 
and documentation. The system has been designated the European 
Network for Information on Drugs and Drug Addiction (Reitox). It 
is intended to create a link between the national information 
networks, the specialized centers in the member states, and the 
information systems of international organizations and agencies 
cooperating with the observatory. 
<H5>  Taking Europol Into Account </H5>
  In this respect, stress should be placed on the third 
article 
of the regulations, which states that the observatory shall take 
into consideration activities carried out, specifically, by the 
European Police Service (Europol), and make an effort to 
evaluate them. 
  Dealing with a rather sensitive issue, the regulations 
stipulate that the observatory shall not collect data that would 
make it possible to identify persons or small groups of persons. 
It must also refrain from any informational activity relating to 
concrete cases and specific names. 
  It must take into account the Council of Europe's Convention 
108, on protection of persons, insofar as the computerized 
treatment of data of a personal nature is concerned.

<F P=106> [Interview by Leonor Figueiredo with George Stievenard; </F>
place and date not given] 
  [Text] "The politicians are working without a network 
in the drug area." DN [DIARIO DE NOTICIAS] was told this by 
George Stievenard, indicated as the future director of the 
European Observatory for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which held 
its first meeting in Lisbon today. The major task is to lend 
consistency to political decisions. 
  In charge of the Drug Department of the Commission of 
European Communities' Secretariat General, he is viewed by the 
experts as the likely future director of the observatory. The 
commission has had a coordinating function since 1990, but it 
was not until after the Treaty of Maastricht went into effect 
that the dynamics for the creation of the European Observatory 
for Drugs, with headquarters in Lisbon, began to take shape. The 
Twelve want a coordinated action, based on the work of the 
observatory, which is due to begin operating this year. 
  DN: What are the functions of the commission that 
you head? 
  Stievenard: This commission analyzes the drug 
problem, and is associated with a dozen general directorates 
working on the issue. It also plans the commission's decisions 
and its participation in the European agencies. With 
coordinating functions since 1990, it resulted from the creation 
of the European Committee To Combat Drugs, a high-level 
political committee including the 12 national coordinators of 
the battle against drugs, and the commission's coordinator, who 
is a commissioner. 
  DN: What is the principal objective? 
  Stievenard: We want to determine the commission's 
orientation and the coordinated positions of the Twelve in the 
battle against drugs. We also want to pay attention to what is 
being done sectorially, on the public health level, and in the 
realm of foreign relations, specifically, involving cooperation 
with Third World countries, the central, Asian, and Latin 
American blocs, and the Mediterranean nations. It is important 
that a coordinated action be selected among the 12 countries, in 
the area of justice, according to the Treaty of Maastricht. 
  DN: Do you think that it will be easy to find a 
global policy among the Twelve? 
  Stievenard: That is the most important aspect. In 
the context of the political effort that we have made since 
1990, the priority is to find a global strategy, in keeping with 
the two European plans for fighting drugs, adopted two years ago 
by the Council of Europe sessions held in Rome and Edinburgh. 
They are largely intergovernmental plans because, before the 
Treaty of Maastricht went into effect, there was no Community 
jurisdiction over the matter. It is a system for coordinating 
the national policies of the Twelve, dealing as consistently as 
possible with the issues of public health, foreign and 
international relations, and justice. 
  DN: Some Community countries have small drug 
observatories. Will you seek in them the "know-how" for 
establishing this European observatory? 
  Stievenard: The existing observatories have not 
advanced beyond an embryonic stage; but the experience is 
important. What was decided by the commission, quite concretely, 
was to explore the possibility of creating a European 
observatory for drugs and drug addiction. It all started there. 
Since 1990 we have traveled to various member countries, 
questioning them. We came face to face with the participants 
working in the drug field, asking them how they would view this 
observatory. On that basis, we made a technical study of the 
future observatory. Oddly enough, to our great satisfaction, we 
perceived that the position of the Twelve was no different. This 
enabled us to move to the next phase: the creation of an agency 
under Community law, and the regulations for creating the 
observatory, adopted in February 1993. In October, we decided 
that the headquarters would be in Lisbon; and we are now in 
contact with the Portuguese authorities to put this observatory 
into operation. 
  DN: Will the European Observatory begin working 
this year? 
  Stievenard: It should start operating in 
September, after the director is installed with an initial 
staff. At the first meeting, (to be held today) at the Belem 
Cultural Center, it will be decided who the members of the board 
of administration will be. The council will have one 
representative for each member state, chosen by each country 
(Portugal will be represented by Father Feytor Pinto), with two 
representatives from the commission in Brussels and two 
designated by the European Parliament. The next phase, with the 
holding of the first board of administration meeting, should 
consist of the naming of its chairman. The second stage will 
involve the designation of the director, but this will probably 
not occur until the second observatory meeting, due to take 
place in June. 
  DN: The observatory already has regulations. Would 
you care to summarize them? 
  Stievenard: They contain major objectives, with a 
twofold ambition. Relying on the national centers gathering 
information on drugs in each country, we shall obtain an overall 
view of the drug problem. In order to make political decisions, 
we must have reliable information on what is happening in each 
country, and in the Twelve as a whole. What is the status of 
drug addiction; how many drug addicts are there? We don't know 
that today. Every country has its own information system, but 
the systems are not compatible; the definitions applied are not 
the same. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a perspective on 
the Twelve. The observatory will have that role, but its 
particular aim will be to harmonize the criteria and definitions 
increasingly, so that the situations in the various countries 
can be compared. 
  DN: The policy of the Community nations on 
repression, prevention, and treatment of drug addicts is like a 
patchwork quilt. Each one has gone its own way.... 
  Stievenard: The different policies among the 
Twelve give us, besides the difficulty stemming from the 
divergence, the opportunity to view the multiplicity of 
experiences. This will be one of the basic functions of the 
observatory: in other words, to learn about these experiences, 
to compare them, and to take examples for a global strategy. It 
will help to determine the political objectives. 
  DN: Will prevention be in the forefront of the 
activities? 
  Stievenard: Prevention will be a priority of the 
plan, as well as the aspects of repression and international 
relations. The commission is preparing a draft plan of global 
action on drugs for the European Union, covering the next five 
years. The drug problem cannot be treated in a sectorialized or 
independent manner. 
  DN: But there is an area of human rights between 
repression and treatment. 
  Stievenard: It is a strategic and extremely 
difficult area. Dialogue must be facilitated between police 
authorities and health technicians. 
  DN: How will the information be shared? 
  Stievenard: The observatory has been created for 
this purpose: to organize the information and make it accessible 
to everyone, to all the technicians, whether they be in the 
justice or public health field. That dialogue is necessary. But 
we realize that this will be difficult to establish 
spontaneously between the ministries of health and internal 
administration in the respective countries. Dialogue is easier 
on the level of the Twelve. When there are difficult relations 
between ministries in the same country, it is better to 
facilitate dialogue among ministries of different countries. The 
Union can achieve this: by using the value of diplomacy in the 
service of a global strategy for the battle against drugs. 
  DN: Are you confident about the observatory's 
future? 
  Stievenard: Without any doubt; I don't see why it 
would not work. Its function is not to substitute for politics, 
but rather to treat the information in a technically sound 
manner, so that it will be useful for the political decisions. 
The politicians are working in this area without a network, 
without a real knowledge of the subject that is essential for 
making decisions, with an understanding of the cause. 
  DN: Do you favor harmonization of the member 
states' laws? 
  Stievenard: That is a long way ahead. We started 
with a situation, before the Treaty of Maastricht went into 
effect, wherein we had 12 countries with their own policies. We 
changed when the treaty took effect, allowing the member states 
to choose the policy, but obliging them to cooperate within the 
framework of the Union. What will happen within the next few 
years (and we want this project to be in effect for the next 
five years) is rapprochement and dialogue among the member 
states. They retain the opportunity for doing what they want on 
the national level, but they are obligated to cooperate; and the 
observatory will furnish technical resources for reinforcing the 
cooperation. They will make their selection by comparing 
experiences. It is necessary to "create" that path. I am 
confident. I believe in opening up dialogue among the states. It 
will make them eliminate the negative consequences of their 
individual choice, and they will be forced to include the 
dimensions of the others. It is progress. The future will tell 
whether it is necessary to go further. 
<H5>  [Box, p 18] </H5>

  -  The politicians are working in this area without a real 
knowledge of the subject, which is essential for making 
decisions, with an understanding of the cause. 
  -  The priority is 
to find a global strategy for the European Union in the battle 
against drugs. 
  -  The observatory should begin operating in 
September, after the director is installed. 
  -  Prevention and 
repression will be priorities in a European plan that will be in 
effect during the next five years. 
  -  Dialogue must be facilitated 
between police authorities and health technicians.

<F P=106> ["a.z."-signed report: "Alarming Balance Sheet of </F>
Drug-Related Deaths"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- The number of drug-related deaths in 
Vienna rose by 10 percent from the previous year to 103 in 1993. 
The 1992/93 drug report, presented on Friday [20 May], points 
out that, above all, an increasing number of young people die 
from overdoses of drugs. The youngest person to die from drugs 
was 14. A total of 10 young people under age died of drug 
consumption. At 37 deaths, the development is also alarming 
among the 20- to 24-year-olds. A new "record" is expected for 
this year because 57 drug-related deaths have been reported so 
far. 
  "Drug-related deaths are no yardstick for a good or bad drug 
policy," Sepp Rieder, the city councillor responsible for 
health, stated, referring to the report. The opposition 
criticized his lack of action and the absence of efficient 
preventive measures.

<F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "Additional New Charges for </F>
Heroin Smuggling"] 
  [Text] Two Nigerian men who are suspected of possession and 
smuggling of heroin received new charges when Helsinki Municipal 
Court heard the case on Thursday [5 May]. 
  The men, who are suspected of belonging to an international 
syndicate distributing Nigerian heroin, were arrested in 
Helsinki at the end of March. According to police, the heroin 
was smuggled to Germany and the United States via Finland. 
  Police have seized as much as 700 grams of heroin from an 
indicted 24-year-old student. This amount would have been worth 
several million markkas on the street. The student had been 
previously charged for possession of approximately half a 
kilogram of heroin. 
  On Thursday the prosecutor asked punishment for two other 
Nigerians for aggravated narcotics violations. 
  According to the indictment, a 32-year-old public relations 
man had, with the aid of a Finnish passport, sent out 250-350 
grams of heroin from this country. The man denied all charges. 
He was previously sentenced to five months imprisonment for 
having smuggled marijuana into Finland. The prosecutor now 
demanded punishment for him and for a 36-year-old student for 
possession of heroin. 
  The student denied he had sought economic gain from the 
activity, saying he had been holding the narcotics as a favor. 
  All three men have resided in Finland for many years. 
  The National Criminal Police got on the gang's trail through 
cooperation with the DEA and U.S. Customs. Authorities in 
Finland and the United States moved against the gang at the same 
time in the United States and Finland. Several suspects have 
also been indicted in the United States. 
  The court will continue dealing with this case on 19 May. 
Pending this, the three are being held.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Charles Pasqua: `Crime Spiral </F>
Broken'"] 
  [Text] "France has stopped the increase in the crime rate, 
which has been rising almost continually over previous years," 
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua told members of the National 
Assembly yesterday as part of the government address on 
security. The following are the main points of his speech. 
<H5>  Statistics </H5>
  According to Mr. Pasqua, from April 1993 to March 1994, the 
overall increase in crimes and misdemeanors in metropolitan 
France "was a mere 0.47 percent." Mentioning as an example car 
thefts and crimes on the public highway, he explained that the 
former "fell by 3.1 percent" while the latter "increased by a 
modest 1.1 percent." Furthermore, and "this is the first time it 
happens in 20 years, violent thefts went down 0.12 percent," he 
indicated. Mr. Pasqua said these figures were "encouraging if 
one looks at the 34 percent overall increase in crime in the 
years 1989-1992, a figure that reaches 54 percent for crime on 
the public highway and even 67 percent for armed robberies." In 
his view, this means that "the spiral is conclusively broken." 
<H5>  Drugs </H5>
  Drug trafficking "decreased by four percent" over the last 
12 
months. To demonstrate "intensive police activity," Charles 
Pasqua indicated that 6,070 dealers, 55 percent of whom were 
foreigners, and 6,289 users-dealers had been arrested and 
subjected to legal proceedings. Last, "for the first time in 
France in 10 years, there was a decline in deaths by overdose: 
454 compared with 499."

Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger by Cornelia von Wrangel; place and

Trial"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Von Wrangler] Apropos young 
people: Does the so-called hashish ruling pave the way for a 
more liberal drug policy? 
  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger: The ruling of the 
Federal Constitutional Court on soft drugs has been completely 
misunderstood by the public, because the Federal Constitutional 
Court just confirmed our law, according to which the possession 
of small amounts of drugs for one's own consumption is also 
punishable. Then the Federal Constitutional Court said that 
punishment may be unnecessary if small amounts are involved. 
Actually, this is precisely the situation that we have at the 
moment. Among the justice ministers of the laender we have 
dealt with the question of what is to be defined as a small 
amount. The Federal Constitutional Court has not answered this 
question. There are very different ideas, ranging from two to 
30 grams. So far, we have not been able to agree on a uniform 
line and, therefore, we will meet again this year. 
  Von Wrangler: Will you agree on an amount below 
10 grams? 
  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger: Yes, I think so. 
  Von Wrangler: Thus, the next political step will 
not be the complete release of hashish? Or the release of 
heroin, as North Rhine-Westphalia Justice Minister Krumsiek 
advocates? 
  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger: No, the legislature 
will not legalize soft drugs in the foreseeable future. What 
applies to soft drugs must also apply to heroin and other hard 
drugs. The ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court does not 
apply to the latter, which means that there is no suspension of 
punishment for the possession of small amounts of hard drugs.

the Event of an SPD Win"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- Johannes Singer, the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany] Bundestag Group's spokesman on drug 
issues, has welcomed the go-ahead to allow hard drugs in small 
quantities of up to 0.5 grams in North Rhine-Westphalia. He 
told DIE WELT that in the event of an SPD election win, an SPD 
government would pursue a similar drugs policy to that of 
Duesseldorf Justice Minister Rolf Krumsiek (SPD). "After the 16 
October elections, there will certainly be a careful 
liberalization of drugs policy in keeping with the guidelines 
from North-Rhine-Westphalia," said Krumsiek. Krumsiek does not 
think the release of smaller quantities of hard drugs will 
encourage people to try them for the first time in their lives. 
"There will not be a single consumer more," he believes. 
Nevertheless, he has spoken out "vehemently" against the 
complete availability or legalization of hard drugs. "The fight 
against the dealers must be stepped up," he says. 
  However, Duesseldorf's drugs policy is controversial within 
the SPD. Saarland Interior Minister Frieder Laepple has 
criticized the initiative as "the wrong path," and Hans 
Gottfried Bernrath, chairman of the Bundestag Internal Affairs 
Committee, has described it as "risky." 
  Krumsiek has been sharply criticised by the Union and the 
FDP 
[Free Democratic Party] grass roots. According to the business 
manager of the Union Bundestag Group, Juergen Ruettger, the very 
state is turning itself into a drug dealer with policies like 
this. "If the disastrous drugs policy of the Johannes Rau 
(SPD)-led land government exerts itself, all the barriers will 
be broken," he said. 
  Christian Socialist Union land group chief Michael Gros 
called on Johannes Rau to stop the justice minister's 
"dare-devil drugs escapade" immediately. He said the minister's 
decision was irresponsible, and meant submission to the drugs 
mafia. Horst Eylmann (Christian Democratic Union), chairman of 
the Bundestag Legal Committee, accused the North 
Rhine-Westphalian Government of sanctioning the use of hard 
drugs "through the back door." FDP deputy Joerg von Essen said 
the North Rhine-Westphalian decision was not dependent either on 
the law or on any Constitutional Court ruling. 
  The Constitutional Court has not explicitly permitted the 
consumption of smaller quantities of soft drugs like hashish and 
marijuana. It has merely instructed the state prosecution to 
quash cases involving such consumption.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Tuesday [17 May] the coalition 
meeting, headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, clearly came out 
against the release of so-called hard drugs and thus against the 
line of North Rhine-Westphalian Justice Minister Rolf Krumsiek 
(Social Democratic Party of Germany). After the meeting 
Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel stated that the coalition 
agreed that the Anti-Crime Law should be adopted as quickly as 
possible. This law is to be discussed at its third hearing in 
the Bundestag this week. 
  Among other things, the coalition politicians discussed drug 
policy after the ruling of the Constitutional Court that, even 
though the possession of small amounts of cannabis products, 
such as hashish and marijuana is not permitted, criminal 
prosecution of such cases should be left to the discretion of 
the public prosecutor's offices. In Krumsiek's view, this 
ruling by the judges in Karlsruhe also covers his plan to no 
longer make the possession of small amounts of heroin and 
cocaine liable to criminal prosecution. This has been opposed, 
above all, by Internal Affairs State Secretary Eduard Lintner 
(Christian Social Union), the Federal Government's drug expert.

<F P=106> [`eli'-signed report: "Conflict Between Bonn and </F>
SPD-Governed Laender; Coalition Sticks to Hard Drugs Ban"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The first conflict seems to be developing 
between the government and a few laender governed by the SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany] on the subject of future 
drugs policy. On Tuesday [17 May], the coalition talks 
consisting of leading Union [Christian Social Union and 
Christian Democratic Union] and FDP [Free Democratic Party] 
politicians decided against the implementation of a far-reaching 
drugs policy like the one in North-Rhine Westphalia. In the 
nearest future, a working group is to decide whether a 
German-wide legal amendment is required in order to keep the 
possession of hard drugs punishable. In North Rhine-Westphalia 
and Schleswig-Holstein, the possession of small quantities of 
heroin and cocaine has recently been legalized. One can even 
buy up to 30 grams of hashish before the law intervenes. 
  CSU [Christian Social Union] Land Group Chief Michael Gros 
expressed criticism of North Rhine-Westphalian Minister 
President Johannes Rau. "It is quite wrong for Rau to remain 
silent about the policy of his own justice minister, Rolf 
Krumsiek," said Gros, who described this policy as a "political 
dare-devil escapade." As a presidential candidate, Rau is 
supposed to bear responsibility for "the whole of German youth," 
said Gros. The coalition talks avoided any criticism of Rau, 
but spoke out firmly against the availability of hard drugs. 
The coalition believes that hard drugs will indeed be freely 
available in North Rhine-Westphalia. Therefore the drugs rule 
must be abolished, it was said. 
  A working group consisting of Health Minister Horst Seehofer 
(CSU), Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger 
(FDP), and Interior Minister Manfed Kanther (Christian 
Democratic Union, CDU) is to establish soon whether the law on 
intoxicating substances should be changed. One of the 
provisions of this law says that drug consumers must not 
necessarily be prosecuted if no damage to public interests is 
detectable or the perpetrator's guilt seems "slight." This is 
the case when drugs are used exclusively for private consumption. 
  Unlike in the case of North Rhine-Westphalia, the coalition 
has so far not expressed any criticism of the drugs policy of 
the Schleswig-Holstein government, which adopted a ruling last 
week whereby the acquisition and possession of up to one gram of 
heroin and up to five grams of cocaine and amphetamines is not 
punishable, just like in North Rhine-Westphalia. People can 
even possess up to 30 grams of cannabis products. In North 
Rhine-Westphalia, the upper limit on cannabis is 10 grams. 
There are still no upper limits in Lower Saxony, where it is up 
to the prosecution to decide whether or not drugs are consumed 
for private purposes. 
  The debate on drugs policy was initiated by a Constitutional 
Court ruling which allows law-enforcement bodies to quash cases 
of drug consumption without actually sanctioning this 
consumption explicitly. The Court has said several times that 
it never meant to permit the consumption of hashish. 
Nevertheless prosecution can be waived in petty cases. In 
addition, the Court recommended the working out of uniform rules 
concerning drug consumption applicable to the entire republic. 
The justice ministers conference in Hamburg at the beginning of 
May decided that the above recommendation be implemented before 
summer. As a result, some laender, such as North 
Rhine-Westphalia, have produced preliminary rules. The justice 
ministers of the individual laender doubt whether these uniform 
German rules can be produced by the time of the 16 October 
elections. The justice ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia says 
there are major differences of opinion between northern and 
southern parts of the country on the subject of drugs. Hesse 
Justice Minister Christine Dennhardt and her Berlin colleague 
Lore-Maria Peschel-Gutzeit (SPD)--Berlin is governed by a 
CDU/SPD coalition--support North Rhine-Westphalia's policy. 
  Bavaria is opposed to a liberalization of drugs consumption, 
and wants life imprisonment for drug dealers. The Bavarian 
government has resolved to table a federal legal initiative 
empowering the courts to impose life imprisonment on drug 
dealers working in organized bands.

<F P=106> [`kl'-signed report: "Dispute in the SPD Over Drugs Policy"] </F>
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- An open row has erupted inside the 
SPD [Social Democratic Party] on the subject of drugs policy. 
On Wednesday [18 May], Peter Struck, federal general manager of 
the SPD Bundestag Group, criticized the SPD North 
Rhine-Westphalian government's decision to permit the possession 
of smaller quantities of drugs, even hard drugs. The North 
Rhine-Westphalian government defended its own decision. 
However, partly as a reaction against sharp criticism from the 
federal government, the Duesseldorf government underscored the 
"provisional" nature of Justice Minister Rolf Krumsiek's drug 
guidelines, and called for uniform German rules laying down 
penalties for violating the law on intoxicating substances. 
  According to a declaration released following a cabinet 
meeting on Wednesday, the waiving of criminal proceedings for 
the possession of small quantities of hard and soft drugs as 
suggested by Krumsiek does not mean a legalization of the 
possession of drugs, nor does it mean a relaxation of the 
practice of law-enforcement bodies until now. With its 
decision, North Rhine-Westphalia is merely acting within the 
limits of feasibility. 
  Interior Minister Herbert Schnoor said that the federal 
government was criticizing the North Rhine Westphalian 
government's decision merely in order to deflect attention away 
from the failure of its own drugs policy, which was geared 
strictly to prosecution rather then therapy and prevention. 
Evidence of the failure of this policy is the fact that since 
the 1982, over 10,000 people have died as a result of a misuse 
of drugs, and almost 100,000 have consumed drugs for the first 
time in their lives. 
  Although Minister President Johannes Rau also supports the 
stance of his justice minister, members of the North 
Rhine-Westphalian government consider both the timing and the 
official reason for Krumsiek's decision to be wrong. They are 
especially critical of the fact that in his guidelines, the 
minister availed himself of the ruling of the Constitutional 
Court even though the Court has said nothing about the 
possession of smaller quantities of hard drugs. 
  According to AFP, Strick called on the justice ministers of 
the SPD-lend land governments to find a common line of policy. 
Strick told DEUTSCHLANDFUNK that the SPD wants no unconditional 
prosecution of drug consumers if they only consume soft drugs 
for private purposes. But Krumsiek's position goes further than 
this, he said. On the other hand, Johannes Singer, the drugs 
expert of the SPD Bundestag Group, defended the North 
Rhine-Westphalia government's decision.

  [Text] The laender decide at their own discretion the 
amount for which possession of hashish, heroin, cocaine, and 
other drugs is not liable to punishment. DIE TAGESZEITUNG 
presents on overview: 
  Baden-Wuerttemberg: Examination of each individual case. 
  In Bavaria, too, each individual case is decided. For 
amounts of up to five grams of hashish, criminal prosecution can 
be waived. No tolerance for hard drugs. 
  Berlin: Examination of each individual case. Same as in 
Bavaria for cannabis products. 
  In Brandenburg criminal prosecution can be waived. In this 
case, the "amount of drugs needed for approximately three hits" 
must not be exceeded. 
  Bremen: The amount of hashish must not exceed a limit of 10 
grams. The limit for hard drugs is three grams. 
  Hamburg: No information. 
  Hesse: Examination of each individual case. The prosecutor 
general's office has issued a noncommittal recommendation that 
criminal prosecution can be waived for amounts of up to 30 grams 
of cannabis products and one gram of heroin. 
  Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: Examination of each 
individual case. 
  Lower-Saxony: Examination of each individual case. 
  North Rhine-Westphalia: Up to 10 grams of hashish and up to 
half a gram of heroin should not be liable for punishment as a 
"small amount." 
  Rhineland-Palatinate: Already in January 1993 Justice 
Minister Caesar introduced a Bundesrat initiative, according to 
which possession of less than 20 grams of hashish and less than 
100 grams of marijuana is punishable only with a fine. 
  Saarland: No guidelines. Criminal prosecution for the 
possession of small amounts is usual only on the third 
repetition. In the case of hard drugs "criminal prosecution 
measures" are taken no matter what. 
  Saxony: Examination of each individual case. 
  Saxony-Anhalt: Here the Justice Ministry "decided quite 
deliberately" not to give any specific amounts as a limit so as 
not to limit "the leeway of the public prosecutor's office." 
  Schleswig-Holstein: Upper limit 30 grams of hashish; cocaine 
and amphetamines up to five grams; heroin up to one gram. 
  Thuringia: Thuringia may be renowned for its sausages, but 
relatively little is known about hashish there. Last year 
police seized 300 grams all over the land. Thus, the public 
prosecutor's offices have little experience. Proceedings may be 
halted for amounts up to five grams. In other cases: "No soft 
treatment for hard drugs."

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Drug Mafia Launches Offensive on </F>
the German Drug Market"] 
  [Text] Security experts are sounding the alarm: They fear 
that the international drug mafia will significantly increase 
its activities in Germany this year and will "more or less 
flood" the German market with drugs of all kinds. To stimulate 
demand, one can expect "dumping prices" for a transitional 
period. 
  This trade offensive can be interpreted as a response to the 
Federal Constitutional Court ruling on hashish and the new drug 
policy adopted by North Rhine-Westphalia, say top German police 
officials. 
  Using their stocks in North Africa and Europe, the drug 
cartels have been bringing more hashish and marijuana onto the 
German market over the past few months. According to the 
Federal Office of Criminal Investigations (BKA) in Wiesbaden, 
the quantity of cannabis products that have been found has 
increased steeply to 1,352 kilograms during the first quarter of 
1994. In the corresponding period last year, police and customs 
officials confiscated 711 kilograms. In 1993, German law 
enforcement agencies removed a total of almost 11.4 tonnes of 
cannabis products and 2.5 tonnes of hard drugs from the market. 
  The overwhelmingly greater part of the cannabis products 
delivered to the drug scene in Europe by "tightly controlled, 
top criminal organizations" came from Morocco. The country is 
one of the states--alongside Lebanon and Pakistan--that 
primarily produces hashish, whereas America and the African 
states of Zaire, Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, and South Africa mainly 
produce marijuana. Nigeria is the main source of marijuana on 
the German scene. 
  The largest European port of entry for cannabis products 
smuggled from Africa is Spain. The dealer organizations run the 
European wholesale trade from there. Various points in the 
Netherlands serve as the largest "half-way storage center" for 
Germany. The Netherlands and German ports organize the bulk of 
the cannabis for the German drug scene. The BKA's view of the 
current situation is: The so-called ant-like process of 
smuggling from the Netherlands is "continuing unabated." 
  According to BKA information, in addition to German drug 
dealers, Turks, Algerians, Moroccans, Italians, and Austrians 
are particularly involved in large-scale trading in cannabis. 
  Because of the relatively large volume, cannabis tends to be 
transported by container via sea, air, truck, or railroad. A 
tried and tested option is the use of barges, that is, pontoons 
used for transporting freight that smugglers use to take the 
drug to ships. This means that ships no longer have to enter 
ports, which means that the turnaround in the use of containers 
is higher and port dues are avoided. In 1992, 9.5 tonnes of 
marijuana were found on these special boats in ten cases. In 
every case, the cargo came from Lagos in Nigeria. 
  The readiness to resort to violence in the drug business is 
causing the police considerable concern. Addressing 
international experts at a working conference in Wiesbaden, BKA 
boss Hans-Ludwig Zachert said: "Organized smugglers and 
wholesalers as well as street dealers are in extensive 
possession of weapons. This great availability of weapons means 
that there is an increased danger that such weapons will be used 
in conflict situations. Police forces at the laender level have 
indications that members of the drug scene are preparing 
themselves for such conflicts. Reports have been received of 
training in the use of firearms. The criminals themselves are 
preparing for the danger of being hit by wearing bullet-proof 
vests."

<F P=106> [Article by Olga Orfanidou: "Triple Score on Heroin"] </F>
  [Text] Alexandroupolis -- The smugglers figured that the 
customs officials would be preoccupied with the TV broadcast of 
the "Olympiakos" [team] basketball game. But they lost their 
nerve when they saw the officials at their posts. A few minutes 
later the customs officials discovered 121 kilograms of heroin 
concealed inside the walls of their mobile home. 
  Giorgen Mery, 31, a cosmetics merchant, and his 36-year-old 
wife, Anette Duna, confessed that they purchased the heroin in 
the Turkish town Yialova and planned to take it to London and 
sell it for 100,000 D.M. (approximately 38 million drachmas) 
[over $158,000]. 
  This is the largest quantity of heroin discovered in Greece 
and the authorities believe that they have dealt a heavy blow to 
the circuit which moves heroin from Turkey to Europe. 
  Those arrested also confessed that in previous years they 
had 
transported large quantities of heroin from Turkey to Europe 
using the Smyrna-Brndizi ferry boat. 
  This time they used their mobile home which they had 
remodeled with the help of Turkish drug dealers. But this first 
transfer by land failed because their information regarding the 
inadequate policing of the Kipoi customs post proved false. 
<H5>  A Large Circuit </H5>
  Stavros Tzioras, director of the Kipoi customs post said 
that 
a large circuit of European and Turkish drug dealers is behind 
the arrested couple, and that after this blow they will think 
twice before they try again to pass narcotics through Evros. 
  Late in the afternoon the couple was taken to the public 
prosecutor. The customs officials estimate that the value of the 
heroin exceeds 2.5 billion drachmas, but with additives this 
quantity is increased threefold for the street market and the 
value increases proportionately. 
  --Two construction workers, refugees from Kazakhstan, 
arrested yesterday in Drama, had in their possession seven 
kilograms of hashish. They are Nikos Motkalidis, 36, and Rafik 
Toulkerogli, 34, who were arrested following surveillance. Today 
they were to be sent to the public prosecutor.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "There Are 10-Year-Old Users!"] </F>
  [Text] The myth of the broken family as the chief cause of 
young people resorting to drug use should perhaps be knocked 
down. There are other causes for drug use according to the 
conclusions of a four-year study by the Forensic Medicine 
Laboratory of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki [AUT], 
which had the sad duty of continually contacting and observing 
the drug-dependent individuals of the area. 
  The conclusions of the study, which were drawn from hundreds 
of interviews and case histories of narcotics users, during the 
period from 1989 to 1993, will be presented today in a report by 
Mr. Matthaios Tsoungas of the Forensic Medicine Department of 
AUT, at the 9th Medical Conference of Northern Greece. 
  The most dramatic fact arising from the analysis of 
interviews with a total of 2,194 individuals who "passed" 
through the laboratory of the Forensic Medicine Department 
during the period from 1989 to 1993 is that the age of first 
contact with narcotics seems to be more often lower, even 
"touching" the preteen years. 
  It is characteristic that--as they themselves confessed--two 
users first came into contact with drugs at the age of 10. 
  One of them--as he himself declared--began with Indian 
cannabis, and the other with medicinal drugs. 
  The results of the analysis of drug users' responses yielded 
the following statistics: 
  Among the drug users, 36.2 percent were illiterate or 
elementary school graduates; 39.6 percent had finished the third 
year of middle school or technical school; 21.8 percent 
indicated that they were high school graduates; and 2.4 percent 
had a college education. 
  The myth of the family environment as a catalytic influence 
would seem to collapse in view of the results of this long-term 
study, because 57 percent of the users of so-called "hard drugs" 
declared that they were not dealing with any problem at home, 
and only 11.2 percent were children from broken homes. 
  Those who had lost one or both parents comprised 13.2 
percent, while 18 percent faced problems with family members 
(siblings, aunts and uncles, etc.). 
  According to Mr. Tsoungas, the only area in which drug users 
displayed a special reluctance to answer was in relation to 
their professional standing, which figures are issued with 
reservations as to their reliability. 
  According to replies of the users themselves, 36.2 percent 
declared themselves unskilled, 33.4 percent were blue-collar 
workers, 12.6 percent were white collar workers, 14.4 percent 
were professionals, 3 percent were farmers, and only one user 
declared himself a scientist. 
  The study's "subject matter" was a sample of 2,194 
individuals, the large majority of whom (over 80 percent) were 
men of all ages. 
  The increase in the number of drug users being brought to 
the 
Forensic Medicine Laboratory in the last few years is worrisome. 
  Specifically, in 1989, 385 individuals were brought for 
examination (after being arrested for use or for dealing); in 
1990 there was an increase to 477; in 1991 a decrease to 416; in 
1992 there were 434; while in 1993 there were 482. 
  The age of those examined varied from 16 up to 76 years old. 
  According to the information in the Forensic Medicine 
Laboratory's study, 46.6 percent of users stated that they began 
using from the age of 18; 43.8 percent stated that they began 
using drugs between the ages of 19 and 25; 9.6 percent of 
respondents began using drugs beyond the age of 25. 
  The users' responses on the causes to blame for their resort 
to narcotics are characteristic: 65.1 percent of the users 
stated that they began using drugs out of curiosity, or through 
peer contact; 14.7 percent thought that they had been lead to 
drugs due to economic or family problems; 6.7 percent stated 
that they began using after joining the the Merchant Marine, 
while 13.5 percent began using during their time of military 
service. 
  With regard to substances with which drug use began, the 
conclusions reached in the study are characteristic--though 
scientifically disputable: 64.7 percent of users stated that 
they began with Indian cannabis, without this meaning that 
cannabis is necessarily serving as the "lead-in" for the 
so-called "hard drugs," especially if one keeps in mind that an 
especially large proportion of chronic cannabis users never go 
on to other substances. 
  Thirty percent of users stated that they began with pills 
and 
other medicinal preparations, while 4.4 percent said that they 
went straight to heroin, and only 0.9 percent stated that they 
began with cocaine.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ten Arrested in Anti-Heroin </F>
Trafficking Operation"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 18 -- Italian police have arrested 
ten people suspected of involvement in an international heroin 
trafficking ring and seized around 40 kilos of heroin in an 
on-going operation aimed at stemming the flow of heroin into 
Italy from the Balkans, police sources disclosed here today. 
  Those arrested on suspicion of involvement in the 
transporting of heroin, mainly from Turkey, are of Italian, 
Albanese, Turkish and Macedonian origin. 
  The operation, code-named Macedonia, is being conducted by a 
police team based in Rome with secret service and anti-drug unit 
collaboration. 
  The sources said that, so far, 40 searches have been made. 
During one of them, Marcello Speranza, the owner of an elderly 
people's home in Ostia outside Rome who was reported as having a 
long criminal record, was arrested. His brother, Vittorio, was 
arrested last November when police found 20 kilos of heroin in 
his possession.

Network of Traffickers in Weapons Purchased in Switzerland and 
Drugs Dismantled"] 
  [Text] Bologna, 14 May (ATS/ANSA) -- The Bologna police 
(Northern Italy) have dismantled an important network of weapons 
and drug traffickers, the Italian authorities announced on 
Saturday [14 May]. The weapons, which were to be sold to 
Calabrian and Sicilian mafia families, had been purchased in 
Switzerland and illegally brought into Italy through the Grison 
Mountains. A total of 33 persons were arrested following the 
investigations that started two years ago. 
  The police action, called "Giano," started in the area of 
Rimini. A group of policemen infiltrated the criminal 
organization that allowed them to trace the network of 
traffickers to the top. In addition to the weapons, that also 
came from former Yugoslavia through Serbo-Croat intermediaries, 
the policemen discovered 16 kg of pure heroin and two kg of 
cocaine. They impounded 15 machine guns, eight high-caliber 
guns, seven pistols, two riot-guns, explosive materials, and 
detonators.

<F P=106> [Article by Eduardo Damaso and Fernando Semedo] </F>
  [Text] The geopolitics of drugs is being discussed 
today in Lisbon, at the Franco-Portuguese Institute. A current 
issue, its debate is being attended by two European specialists: 
Labrousse, head of the geopolitical observatory for drugs in 
Paris, and Stievenard, chief of the EC's [European Community] 
drug unit. This is a useful debate in a country such as 
Portugal, which is the entryway for half of the cocaine consumed 
in Europe. Exaggeration or not, this is the percentage cited by 
several observers. At least it allows us to understand the 
dimensions of the facilities enjoyed by the drug traffic on the 
Portuguese coast. This situation is a result of the lack of 
inspection facilities, but is also due to the corruption of 
agents in certain forces supposedly existing to combat the drug 
traffic. 
  There are over 100 agents from the defunct Customs Guard 
[GF] 
and the Maritime Police, with ranks as high as lieutenant and 
captain, providing security for the unloading of drugs on the 
Portuguese coast. This situation, which PUBLICO reported in 
feature articles published on 21 and 22 December of last year, 
has been described in various official documents. However, a 
more detailed account is provided in a confidential survey 
conducted by the Criminal Investigations Police nearly a year 
ago, along the entire Portuguese coast. 
  This survey, based on information collected during various 
drug trafficking proceedings, was reported to the justice 
minister, Laborinho Lucio, early last year. On several 
occasions, he referred to this situation at meetings of the 
Council of Ministers. 
  PUBLICO has learned that the survey was being discussed by 
the Criminal Investigations Police administration, which decided 
to notify the minister of the facts. The seriousness of the 
situation would entail options (regarding material resources 
and, possibly, coordination among various police forces) on a 
cabinet level. Hence, the decision was made to inform the 
minister of the report's existence. 
<H5>  Country Divided Into Areas of Influence </H5>
  The abolishment of the Customs Guard may have been hastened 
owing to the situation described in the report. This is one of 
the hypotheses accepted by several sources contacted by our 
newspaper. They even admit the possibility that various measures 
for coordinating the security forces in the drug area may have 
been discussed in the context of the serious state of corruption 
existing among the paramilitary forces. 
  The document, prepared by a brigade created especially for 
this purpose, was written in order to identify the individuals 
and logistical resources involved in the drug trafficking along 
the Portuguese coast, for subsequent investigations of both the 
trafficking and money laundering. 
  The work carried out made it possible to identify the groups 
operating from the Algarve coast to Minho, with their leadership 
structures and operational facilities; as well as the boats, 
warehouses, vehicles, properties, and assets purchased with the 
profits. Also identified were the accomplices "contracted" in 
institutions such as the ex-Customs Guard and the Maritime 
Police. There are nearly 50 names of individuals, including 
civilians and agents of the security forces; as well as accounts 
of millions of contos' worth of houses, vehicles, boats, and 
warehouses. 
  The agents most directly involved with the traffickers are 
of 
low rank; nevertheless, in at least half a dozen cases the 
situations involving collaboration with the unloading of drugs 
are known to persons with high-level assignments in the chain of 
command. A captain, lieutenants, and sergeants, as well as 
scores of agents, have been identified. 
  In the survey, which has already prompted several individual 
investigations, the country is divided into areas of influence 
wielded by the groups most active in the unloadings. It is well 
known that the main organizations are set up in the Viana do 
Castelo district, in Foz do Douro, Matosinhos, Espinho, Figueira 
da Foz, Peniche, Nazare, Cascais, Lisbon, Sesimbra, Setubal, 
Sines, Vila do Bispo, and Portimao. In some of the cases 
detected, entire outposts of the ex-Customs Guard were found to 
be implicated with the Mafia engaged in unloading drugs. 
  Those localities along the Portuguese coast are the chief 
reception sites for the drugs, which arrive on medium and 
large-sized vessels as far as the boundaries of the national 
waters. They are later transferred to smaller craft (in some 
instances, to boats belonging to the GF itself), which carry 
them to warehouses, some located on sites a little farther from 
the coast. 
<H5>  Spaniards Know </H5>
  The work done by the Portuguese police has updated some 
information already contained in a report prepared by the DEA 
[Drug Enforcement Administration] in 1989, following an 
infiltration of the network run by the Galician drug trafficker, 
Laureano Oubina (one of those with better contacts in Portugal), 
and of the Spanish police. 
  During the investigation related to the proceedings that 
culminated in Operation Necora, Judge Baltazar Garzon had in his 
possession the names of all the contacts of some of the leading 
Galician drug dealers in Portugal, particularly those in the 
Algarve. There was even information detailing the names of bars, 
restaurants, and coffee shops visited or owned by some of those 
contacts, with telephone numbers, home addresses, etc. 
  This information was retained in the dossiers of the Spanish 
police who, as several sources from Portuguese police circles 
told PUBLICO, have "highly detailed" information on who's who in 
the Portuguese drug trade. At least, they know who is providing 
logistical support to the Spanish traffickers. 
  Much of this information may have been provided to the 
Spanish authorities by the "repentant subject," in the Necora 
process, Ricardo Portabales, whose statement was heard by the 
Portuguese police in Madrid last summer. Portabales' hearing was 
prompted by the many references that he made, in interviews 
published in the Spanish and Portuguese press, to a meeting held 
in Cascais three years earlier, between Galician and Portuguese 
drug traffickers. However, during the questioning to which he 
was subjected by the Portuguese police, he did not give any 
objective information possible to put in writing. 
<H5>  European Police Attentive </H5>
  Certain police forces and intelligence services in some 
European countries and in the United States may also have known 
for some time the content of the report whose existence we are 
revealing publicly today. 
  The British intelligence service, MI-5, and Scotland Yard, 
the British police headquarters, are in this category. The same 
may hold true of the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency), the U.S. 
police department specializing in combating drugs, and of the 
German police. 
  Portugal's role in the international drug trafficking 
networks has warranted very special attention from those police 
forces. Some of them have agents here on a full-time basis. The 
drug traffic and matters associated with the (legal or illegal) 
arms business are the focus of special attention. 
  Moreover, the DEA, which is currently monitoring Portugal 
from its office in Madrid, is preparing to become installed in 
Lisbon as well. 
  Despite the highly confidential nature of the information 
revealed in the document, those agents working in close 
proximity to the Portuguese investigators in the Criminal 
Investigations Police have had access to it.

<F P=106> [Article by Eduardo Damaso and Fernando Semedo] </F>
  [Text] In Spain, the Customs Surveillance Service (SVA) 
which, during the 1980's, was converted into a major force for 
repressing the international drug traffic, has at its disposal 
78 ships, six airplanes, five helicopters, and 350 vehicles on 
the ground supporting its operations. As if that were not 
enough, 17 of the aircraft have the capacity for intervention on 
the open sea, allowing their crews to board suspicious vessels. 
It is a powerful armada. 
  In Portugal, there is no clear perception of whether the 
surveillance on the coast for this purpose is assigned to the 
force that resulted from the abolishment of the Customs Guard, 
or to the Navy, although it is the former that controls the 
sophisticated system for detecting suspicious vessels that has 
been set up along the coast. At least the results of this type 
of surveillance have never been observed. 
  However, since the early 1980's, Portugal has been one of 
the 
main entryways for traffickers into Europe. The Portuguese 
Criminal Investigations Police inspector, Dias Costa, a 
specialist in the investigation of the international traffic, 
prepared a study on Portugal's transformation into a major area 
for the entry of South American cocaine and Moroccan hashish 
into Europe. 
  Factors of a political and economic nature, particularly the 
Spanish authorities' protectionism for the public tobacco 
enterprise, prompted the Galician contraband and drug 
trafficking groups to concentrate their drug unloading 
activities in Viano do Castelo and in the Algarve, particularly 
in Lagos, Portimao, and Sagres. 
  Dias Costa remarks: "Although the Spanish traffickers harbor 
a special preference for the Algarve in their activities, since 
it is a region protected from winds, even those in summer, and 
is located closer to Morocco, they have begun spreading their 
influence more toward the north. Some still remained in the 
Palmela area until 1986." 
  According to Dias Costa, the advancement to the Alentejo 
coast and the Setubal peninsula may have been due to the 
"considerable support that was found, enabling them to carry out 
the unloading without any problems." The fact is that, after the 
arrest of the drug trafficker, Laureano Oubina, and of the 
Charlins brothers, in Troia, the Galician traffickers' methods 
changed. This occurred because they concluded that they could 
avoid risks and expense by transporting drugs to the Portuguese 
coast, since they have at their disposal here "a multitude of 
fishermen with financial and logistical problems of all kinds." 
  Dias Costa recalls that: "At that time, there were fishermen 
who were selling essential parts of the equipment on their 
boats, even anchors, so as to be able to meet the most 
fundamental needs of their families." 
  As a result, a situation difficult to control was created. 
"Let's not deceive ourselves. The unloading of hashish and 
cocaine on our seacoast is occurring at such a rate that no one 
could, in all honesty, tell how many hundreds of tons of either 
drug passed through here last year."

  [Excerpts] A large-scale operation against the criminal 
world was carried out in Tbilisi today. [passage omitted] 
Operations aimed at establishing peace and challenging criminal 
gangs and mafia clans were carried out in eight towns and rayons 
in the republic. 
  This morning, Tbilisi was completely sealed off. Roadblocks 
were put up at the city's key junctions, and police, security 
and guard units started apprehending crime suspects, 
confiscating fire-arms and explosives from the population and 
unmasking drugs dealers. 
  More than 40 suspects, including 11 people wanted for 
serious 
crimes, were detained by 10:00 in the morning. Some 30 
automatic guns, machine-guns, dozens of hand grenades, pistols 
and grenade launchers were confiscated from citizens and 
criminals. The police discovered 100 stolen cars. A large 
number of drug addicts and dealers were unmasked. The operation 
is still under way. 
  It can be said that operations like this, especially when 
hundreds of law-enforcement officials are involved, can rarely 
be prepared in absolute secrecy. Nevertheless, one can say that 
the criminal world suffered a telling blow. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] As for the fact that 
there is military hardware in the streets, I would like to 
stress that the Ministry of Internal Affairs and its units have 
nothing to do with politics. We are not taking part in 
political discussion. Roadblocks were erected in order to give 
peace to our city. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Edict of the Georgian Head of State on Urgent Measures To </F>
Strengthen the Struggle Against Drug Addiction and the Drugs 
Business"] 
  [Text] The difficult socioeconomic situation that exists 
in the Republic of Georgia, the deterioration of the crime 
situation, and the weakening of border controls have contributed 
to the spread of drug addiction in the country. It is also 
significant that the drugs mafia in different countries is 
showing a particular interest in Georgia as a country that is 
convenient for the transit of drugs. An internal market is 
arising in Georgia for the production and sale of drugs derived 
from plants. The spread of drug addiction among minors and 
adolescents is arousing particular concern and drug addiction 
among women is also a serious problem. 
  In order to plan, coordinate, and control measures aimed at 
the comprehensive prevention of drug addiction in the Republic 
of Georgia, the implementation of a single state policy in this 
sphere, and to combat drug addiction and the illegal circulation 
of narcotic substances, a government commission has been formed 
under the chairmanship of Georgian Deputy Prime Minister I. 
Menagharishvili. The commission is made up of representatives of 
the Republic of Georgia Cabinet of Ministers and scientific, 
health, and youth organizations. 
  In order to strengthen further the struggle against drug 
addiction and the drugs business, it is decreed: 
  1. To accept the proposal of the government commission and 
to create a national bureau for combating drug addiction and the 
drugs business on the basis of the Republic of Georgia Ministry 
of Internal Affairs Department for Combating Drug Addiction and 
the Drugs Business. 
  2. The Republic of Georgia Ministry of Internal Affairs is 
to ratify the rules and structure of the National Bureau for 
Combating Drug Addiction and the Drugs Business within a period 
of 10 days. 
  3. The Republic of Georgia Ministry of Justice, along with 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs, is to prepare within one month 
draft legislative acts on controlling the legal circulation of 
narcotic and psychotropic substances, on combating their illegal 
circulation, and on conferring the right to the Republic of 
Georgia Ministry of Internal Affairs National Bureau for 
Combating Drug Addiction and the Drugs Business to sell 
valuables confiscated by a decision of the court in this 
category of cases. 
  4. The Republic of Georgia Ministry of Communications is to 
provide the service with modern means of communication by 1 May 
of this year. 
  5. The Republic of Georgia Cabinet of Ministers and the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs are to provide the National Bureau 
for Combating Drug Addiction and the Drugs Business with a 
material and technical base within a period of one month. 
  6. In order to protect the rule of law in matters concerning 
the struggle against drug addiction and the drugs business and 
exercise supervision, a department is to be created within the 
Republic of Georgia Procurator's Office to supervise cases 
concerning the illegal circulation of narcotic and psychotropic 
substances. 
  7. The Republic of Georgia Customs Department is to create a 
corresponding service in order to strengthen organized control 
over the transfer of narcotic and psychotropic substances at 
customs checkpoints. To report the results to the Government 
Commission for Combating Drug Addiction and the Illegal 
Circulation of Drugs. 
  8. The Republic of Georgia Ministry for Health Protection is 
immediately to create a republican inspectorate to control the 
legal circulation of narcotic and psychotropic substances. 
  9. The Republic of Georgia Ministries of Internal Affairs 
and Health Protection are to provide a register of [those 
involved in] the drugs business and users of drugs for 
nonmedical purposes and ensure the effective implementation of 
Georgian Head of State Decree 32 of 5 February 1994. 
  10. The Republic of Georgia Television and Radio 
Broadcasting Corporation and the Republic of Georgia Information 
and Publishing Corporation are to cooperate closely with the 
Republic of Georgia Ministry of Internal Affairs National Bureau 
for Combating Drug Addiction and the Drugs Business and the 
Republic of Georgia Ministry of Health Protection Drug Research 
Institute in order to disseminate efficiently the appropriate 
information on television and in the press.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Ladin report under the "Events and Commentaries" </F>
rubric: "One `Noose' Is No Longer Enough"] 
  [Text] A law and order operation codenamed "Noose" was in 
effect throughout Kazakhstan for more than a week. It was 
carried out at the initiative of the republic's President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
  No state of emergency was imposed in Alma-Ata [Almaty] or 
the 
other cities, Kairbek Suleymanov, state councillor of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, underlined in his interview for KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA. But the rising crime had become so "burning" an issue 
that the situation called for tough measures, which proved 
sudden to some extent. The first unusual thing was that 
substantial law and order forces, including internal troops, 
were brought in to impose order in towns and populated centers. 
No army units were deployed. 
  The job done is not small. According to the state 
councillor, 50,428 people came under scrutiny of the patrols and 
militia bodies during the week. Naturally, those are people 
only detained for offenses. 
  During the week 333 kg of narcotics were seized. The 
militia's "hauls" were sometimes between 0.5 to 1.5 kg. 
Suleymanov does not dispute that some regular routes for drugs 
coming from Tajikistan were discovered, but in 11 instances the 
"goods" were carried by citizens of that republic. 
  Some 1,500 illegally stored weapons were seized. Militia 
seized a submachinegun and a "Mukha" hand-held grenade launcher 
from Oleg Osadchiy, a military officer, who was attempting to 
sell them. 
  The operation is over. On the whole it yielded the expected 
results while one cannot say that crime in Kazakhstan has been 
finally defeated.

<F P=106> [XINHUA Commentator: "A Grand Blueprint for China's </F>
Sustained Development"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Apr (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
recently approved "China's Agenda 21," representing a practical 
step that China has taken to implement the resolutions of the 
United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development and 
a major event in China's efforts toward sustainable development. 
In a sense, the "Agenda" sketches for China a blueprint for 
development in the 21st century. 
  China is a developing nation with nearly a 1.2 billion 
population. China's foremost goal and task at present is to 
develop the economy and shake off poverty and backwardness. 
Like many developing countries, China faces global 
environmental problems such as climatic changes, ozone layer 
depletion, and reduced species diversity. In developing the 
economy, it also needs to address the problem of environmental 
pollution, ecological destruction, and devastation of natural 
resources. Due to low productivity levels, in the past China 
opted for economic development on a grand scale, seeking to 
realize high levels of growth through massive investment in 
industries with high levels of energy consumption and pollution. 
This led to the depletion of natural resources, the worsening of 
environmental pollution, and ecological destruction. As China's 
economy has now entered a stage of high-speed development, 
greater pressure will surely be brought to bear on our natural 
resources and environment if we continue to stick to an outdated 
development pattern and only emphasize quantitative growth to 
the neglect of qualitative improvements to the economy. If we 
fail to change our direction, we will be forced to pay a greater 
price; China's modernization process will be delayed; and the 
foundation of the existence and development of the Chinese 
nation will even be undermined. 
  Sustainable development is a great cause that has not yet 
been taken up in the course of human history. 
  Sustainable development in China is an important component 
of 
global sustainable development. The only way for China to 
ensure sustainable and high-speed development is to opt for a 
development path that will not only promote the economy but also 
protect the environment. The idea behind the formulation of 
"China's Agenda 21" is to promote sustainable development in 
China. 
  For human beings at the close of this century and the next, 
the issues of population, natural resources, and the environment 
will be common themes. As a developing country, China is 
entrusted with an important mission. The scope of the rational 
use of resources and environmental protection is no longer 
limited to the prevention of environmental pollution and to the 
restoration of the ecological system, but is being extended to 
a greater range of economic development and social progress. 
This marks a great leap in the cognitive level of human beings. 
It is precisely because of such a cognitive leap that we are 
presented with a new opportunity for development. It is 
necessary to realize high economic efficiency and to conserve 
natural resources and to lower energy consumption through 
setting a rational industrial setup, standardizing the types and 
scales of industrial enterprises, formulating and implementing 
correct industrial policies, accelerating the pace of 
readjusting industrial structure and technological 
transformation, and popularizing non-polluting production 
technologies and adopting non- polluting production methods. It 
is also necessary to continue experimenting with ecological 
farming projects; to greatly popularize non-polluting 
technologies for farming production; to rationally develop, 
utilize, and protect farmland; to enhance the capability to 
combat natural disasters; to gradually build an 
intensive-farming industry; and to help establish a rational 
structure for city planning. 
  The birth of "China's Agenda 21" marks a good beginning for 
China's sustainable development. Now, the most important task 
for us is to advance the comprehensive implementation of 
"China's Agenda 21" in a down-to-earth manner. 
  The Chinese people have made tremendous contributions to 
human civilization. The Chinese people, by adhering to the 
policy of reform and opening up, are now advancing step by step 
along the path of sustainable development. We will surely have 
a bright future. China will surely make new contributions to the 
global environment and development.

  [Text] Beijing, April 17 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Ministry 
of Posts and Telecommunications is to issue, on April 21, a set 
of four stamps featuring desert afforestation. 
  Designs and denomination of these stamps are: "the vast 
expanse of desert", 15 fen; "flowers in the desert", 20 fen; 
"forest of diversiform-leaved poplar", 40 fen; and "oasis in the 
desert", 50 fen. 
  Desertification is a serious environmental problem 
challenging the whole globe. China has vast areas of desert and 
is seriously affected by desertification. At present deserts 
constitute 15.9 percent of China's land area. 
  In recent years China has achieved notable results in 
harnessing desertification, with drought-enduring shrubs and 
trees, such as the diversiform-leaved poplar, planted to shelter 
farmland and stop moving dunes. 
  So far, some 6.7 million hectares of the country's deserts 
have been afforested, and 10 percent of the desertified land has 
been effectively harnessed. 
  The designer of the stamps is Meng Sihui from the Palace 
Museum.

  [Text] Lanzhou, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Chinese geologists 
believe that the bulging movement of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau 
affects the the global climate along with the formation of 
plateau monsoons. 
  Extensive investigations beginning last year on this highest 
plateau in the world by a team of Chinese scientists have shown 
that plateau monsoons have a strong influence on sand storm and 
precipitation distribution worldwide. 
  Before the formation of plateaus the global climate was mild 
and humid with little variation in different places, according 
to scientists at the Lanzhou Institute of Plateau Atmospheric 
Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in northwest 
China's Gansu Province. 
  In the tertiary period, the scientists said, the 
Qinghai-Tibet plateau began to rise. Consequently the global 
environment and climate started to change. 
  In other words, the swelling of the plateau led to the 
formation of hot low pressure in summer and cold high pressure 
in winter around the plateau, and plateau monsoons began to 
emerge. 
  The scientists estimated that the monsoon formation could be 
traced back as early as 37 million years ago, and it took its 
present form about one million years ago. 
  Such changes in atmospheric circulation in turn caused sharp 
temperature drops along the earth's medium and high latitudes, 
and the geological distribution of precipitation also began to 
take on monsoon traits. In summer, the land to the east of the 
plateau was humid while the land to the west was dry. 
  About 2.4 million years ago the plateau rose to 1,500 m 
above 
sea level on the average. Now the average elevation is 4,500 m. 
  The scientists said the intensification of circulating 
currents made the climate along the medium and high latitudes of 
the northern hemisphere turn cold, and glacial periods emerged. 
  Monsoons also strengthened the high-altitude subsidence 
airstream in the southwest of the plateau, which resulted in 
drought in northern Africa, with the original forest climate 
turning into a semi-arid climate. Man appeared at this time. 
  On the other hand, due to a strong wind belt two km over the 
land surface caused by the plateau monsoon, the yellow sand 
north of the plateau was stirred up and descended onto the 
northeast of the plateau to form a loess plateau covering 
600,000 sq km over the years. 
  In addition, intensified sunlight reflected on the plateau 
surface after the swelling movement led to abnormal air 
circulation in the entire northern hemisphere. In turn, the 
middle and eastern part of the American continent became humid 
and its western part turned warm and dry. 
  With the aid of satellite data, scientists at the Lanzhou 
Institute of Desert Research found that widespread snowfall and 
glaciers due to the swelling affected the global climate, too. 
  They also discovered that the plateau monsoon accelerated 
the 
speed of wind in spring in the central Asian region, and 
large-scale sand storms emerged in desert areas and places short 
of vegetation, between February and May in particular. 
  Sand particles can be carried as far as the waters of the 
Northern Pacific Ocean and Northwest Indian Ocean.

  [Text] Beijing, 16 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- In recent 
years river channels inside and outside Beijing have suffered 
from human-made destruction and serious pollution. Therefore, 
some experts have time and again warned relevant departments and 
citizens that because there is a serious shortage of water 
resources and pollution is getting worse, many river channels on 
the outskirts of Beijing have silted up. 
  The River and Lake Management Section of the Beijing 
Municipal Water Resources Bureau revealed that former Beijing 
Mayor Chen Xitong personally inspected the Erdao channel in 
Jintailu last year. This channel was called a "present-day 
dragon beard ditch" [meaning the channel was full of residue]. 
He immediately instructed the relevant department to improve 
the situation. In a week the dregs were cleared but the channel 
stilted up again the following week. It was learned that the 
river water passing through this channel was for the Beijing No. 
1 Thermal Power Station to generate electricity. The silt in the 
channel caused by pollution threatened the normal operation of 
the power station. Once the relevant department dredged up some 
tree branches, foam plastics, bicycles, three-wheeled carts, 
dead pigs, and dead dogs from a silted-up section of the channel. 
  Pollution similar to this is not rare in Beijing. Some 
experts said that apart from industrial pollution, the most 
threatening is human-made pollution. Most of the 175-km long 
river channels on the Beijing outskirts are clean in the upper 
portions, green in the middle, and black in the lower reaches. 
Protecting water resources, which are seriously in short 
supply, has become an urgent task for Beijing.

<F P=106> [Report by Zhu Baoxia: "Nepa Reveals $1.6m Pollution Fine </F>
Scheme"] 
  [Text] The National Environmental Protection Agency (Nepa) 
yesterday announced a $1.6 million plan to improve China's 
pollution charges system. 
  The two-year project involves a pollution study and aims to 
work out new charges for offenders, said Lu Xinyuan, deputy 
director of Nepa's supervision and development department. 
  It is being financed by a $1 million loan from the World 
Bank 
and 5 million yuan ($600,000) from central and provincial 
governments. 
  All enterprises are to be taxed for emitting sulphur dioxide 
before the end of the year and they will have to pay for 
discharging solid waste next year. 
  Lu said the measures would help curb the spread of acid rain 
which is caused by sulphur dioxide. 
  Acid rain damages crops, forests and buildings and costs 
China an estimated 16 billion yuan ($2 billion) a year. 
  It is currently spreading from Southwest to East China, the 
official said. 
  The country first adopted pollution charges in the late 
70's. 
  And 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have 
levied charges on 113 pollutants. 
  More than 200,000 enterprises nationwide have paid a total 
of 
18 billion yuan ($2 billion) in the past 15 years. 
  Last year, they paid 2.7 billion yuan ($310 million) -- more 
than lO times the figure in the late 70's. 
  The charges have been used to subsidize the control of key 
polluted areas. 
  And they have covered 6 per cent of the country's total 
spending on the control of industrial pollution. 
  Studies into the uses of pollution charges in 24 large and 
medium-sized cities showed 796 million yuan ($139 million at the 
old exchange rate) had been levied on 3,901 enterprises in seven 
years. 
  This cash, plus government investment, funded the 
construction of more than 7,000 pollution-control projects 
nationwide. They were designed to treat 794 million tons of 
waste water and 199.1 billion cubic metres of waste gas a year.

<F P=106> [Article by Yang Ailian [2799 1947 5571] </F>
  [Text] Grassland is one of China's six primary resources, 
totalling 6 billion mu in area (400 million hectares), amounting 
to 40 percent of the total area of the country. China's 
grasslands are not only extensive, but they are widespread, 
stretching from 310 to 610 longitude. China's grasslands are 
divided into 17 major types, over 30 subtypes, and over 1,000 
specific varieties where more than 7,000 species of natural 
pasture grasses and feed plants grow. Within China's 
21,000-kilometer borderline, 14,000 are on grasslands. Most of 
these grasslands are on the frontier in remote areas where 
diverse minority peoples live, and much of it ancient and poor. 
  The protection, practical utilization, and development of 
grassland resources are not only of strategic economic 
importance, but also of strategic importance for strengthening 
the solidarity of the people, turning poverty into riches, 
strengthening border defenses, administering the national 
territory, and protecting and improving the ecological 
environment. 
  1.113 billion mu of China's 6 billion mu of grasslands are 
southern mountain grasslands or grazing lands, and in the north 
there are 378 million mu of grasslands, more than half of which, 
on average, are not in use. About 400 million mu of grazing 
lands are arid or summertime pasturage not yet fully developed 
for use, and over 1 billion more are depleted grassland that 
need to be renewed to greatly raise their level of productivity. 
Although the utilization of China's grasslands is presently in a 
period of transition in the level of productivity and method of 
management and utilization, moving away from the natural grazing 
stage to one of intensified management, they are still largely 
being plundered by the old style of grazing. Grassland resources 
have not been used to their fullest advantage and have not yet 
reached full production potential, and their present level of 
production is very low. In 1989, livestock production per 100 mu 
of grassland was one-twentieth of that of the U.S., one-tenth 
that of Austria, and one-eightieth that of New Zealand. 
  The low productivity of China's grasslands does not arise 
from lack of actual natural resources, but from historical 
social and circumstantial causes, mainly: 
  1. Poor, unconstructive and backward management of 
grasslands 
for pasturage has caused grasslands to recede markedly. 
Grassland laws and protective controls are weak, and more than 
100 million mu of grassland has been destroyed through 
exploitation in recent decades. Grassland management has for a 
long time been a practice of "eating from the big pot", and the 
management, construction, and utilization rights, 
responsibilities and benefits have not been driven home to the 
people, and that's why there has been an increase in 
over-grazing. Grasslands have been simply used and not 
replenished for a long time, and for decades, for every yuan of 
annual output from every mu of grassland, only 2 or 3 fen have 
been re-invested. Being unable to make ends meet has led to 
predatory management and relentless disappearance of grasslands 
which have turned to sand and salt, causing the depletion of 
over 1 billion mu of grassland. Grass production is down to 
two-thirds or one-half of what it was in the 1950's, hastening 
the loss of grasslands and wetlands, and increasing the hazards 
of sandstorms and pestilence. 
  2. Although the water and temperature conditions of mountain 
grasslands and grazing areas in the south are good, traditional 
farming mentality hinders the advance of efficient grass and 
pasturing technology and methodologies, and progress has been 
made in only a few places, while in most areas resources are 
still being wasted. In many places grass on mountain slopes has 
been removed to plant cereal crops, causing loss of wetlands, 
ecological damage, and bringing poverty to the mountain and the 
people, or creating a situation comparable to going begging with 
a gold cup. 
  3. Damage caused by mixed farming and grazing of mountain 
grasslands and grazing areas in the north has been serious. 
Although conditions are good for grasses and excellent for mixed 
farming and grazing, the attitude of favoring farming over 
grazing, and using grasslands for cereal crops has been 
detrimental to the development of grasslands, such as on the 
Sanjiang plain, the loess plateau, and the Huanghai coastal 
grasslands where the land has been turned to sand and salt, the 
ecological environment has been damaged, and use of grassland 
resources has been counter-productive. 
  A national program for the development of grassland has been 
formulated to improve grasslands in order to meet the demand for 
wool, milk, beef and mutton, the needs for economic development 
of grassland areas and management of the national territory. A 
policy for a ten-year goal for grassland development has been 
formulated to integrate key-point development with overall 
administration, construction and management, and to make full 
use of the advantages in the north and south. Along with 
enforcement of national grassland laws and a compensatory 
contract responsibility system, and nationwide administration 
for development of vanishing grasslands, good grazing stock 
processing facilities should be built and commercial grazing 
stock product bases should be created in key development areas, 
in the northern mountain grassland and grazing locations, and in 
southern mountain grassland and grazing areas. Key projects 
should be implemented to build livestock feeding and shelter 
facilities on grasslands, meat and hides projects on northern 
grasslands, projects to emulate New Zealand on southern 
grasslands, green-light projects to control the depletion of 
grasslands, and other capital construction projects in grassland 
areas. 
  The following development policies must be adopted to 
realize 
the above targets: 
  1. Put more effort into publicizing "grassland laws", enact 
better grassland laws and perfect the legal system as soon as 
possible, set up stronger enforcement organizations, raise the 
quality of law-enforcement units, resolve and eradicate 
grassland destruction, put a time limit on effecting property 
and utility rights, and credentials, put the compensatory 
responsibility system into full force, put teeth into grassland 
protection, ensure practical use and effective construction of 
grasslands. 
  2. Development and utilization of grassland resources should 
be brought into capital construction planning and financial 
business development plans to guarantee a steady input and 
supply of materials; 
  3. Nationally and locally financed grassland development 
foundation systems should be set up, mainly through financial 
outlays or land occupation and utilization taxes, grassland 
resource management fees, pasturage taxes, slaughterhouse taxes, 
part of which should be used for development of grassland 
resources. These foundations could be used for repayments, and 
managed by livestock (grassland) handling departments, and 
supervised and checked by financial departments; 
  4. Grassland resource administrative organizations should be 
strengthened. Among China's 6 major resources, grasslands occupy 
the largest area, but there is only one office-level (grassland 
office) unit with management responsibility, which, as the 
socialist market economy develops, will become unsuitable for 
handling the development and utilization of grassland resources. 
China must setup competent management organizations for 
effective macro-controls, supervision, and inspection of 
grassland resources.

<F P=106> [Article by Xu Shangxiang [5171 1424 3276]: "An Alarm: </F>
Harmful Effects of Acid Rain Expanding in China"] 
  [Excerpts] In recent years, the harmful effects of acid 
rain in China have been expanding. In 1992, the amount of sulfur 
dioxide emitted into the atmosphere surpassed 17 million tons, 
and surveys indicate that a quarter of the cities in northern 
China have atmospheric sulfur dioxide concentrations above the 
permissible level of 0.15 mg/m[.sup]3[/]. In southern China, 
the acidity of precipitation is increasing perceptibly, and the 
area subject to acid rain, which originally was confined to the 
Chongqing-Guiyang and Nanchang-Changsha regions, now includes 
the Fuzhou-Xiamen, Changzhou-Shanghai-Hangzhou, and 
Qingdao-Jinan areas. The harmful effects of acid rain are now 
among the ten major environmental problems facing China's 
modernization. 
  1. Destruction of Forests. Before acid rain reaches the 
ground, it damages the leaves of trees, causing them to become 
yellow, gradually lessening their photosynthetic ability, 
leaching out nutrients, and causing the leaves to wither and 
fall. When acid rain enters the soil, it dissolves inorganic 
nutrients, leaches them away, and also decreases the amounts of 
organic matter in the soil, thus decreasing soil fertility. Acid 
rain also hinders root development, retards the growth of trees, 
and decreases their resistance to disease and insect pests, with 
the result that large areas of forest are killed. In the 
mid-1980's, precipitation in Sichuan had become significantly 
acid (in 1989 the pH of rain in Chongqing had fallen to 4.21), 
and acid rain was abundant in the Chengdu and Chongqing regions; 
as a result, the huashan pines at Fengjie, the firs of Mount 
Emei, and the masson pines in the hills south of Chongqing have 
been damaged over an area of more than 100,000 mu. 
  2. Corrosion of Buildings and Structures. Acid rain can 
react 
chemically with limestone, sandstone, concrete, and metals. The 
resulting corrosion damages or defaces buildings, statues, and 
cultural relics. It has been reported in the press that owing to 
the effects of acid rain the Leshan Buddha, the largest statue 
of the Buddha in the world, is already seriously affected: its 
face is pitted, its nose is blackened, its body is wasting away, 
material has been lost from the hands, feet and shoulders, and 
the outer garment is being worn away, making urgent measures 
necessary. High-voltage electric transmission lines, railways, 
metal bridges, motor vehicles and skyscrapers are being corroded 
by acid rain, which decreases their service life and 
necessitates more frequent repair. Surveys in Guangdong and 
Guangxi provinces found that the cost of rustproofing metal 
equipment such as that described above exceeds 100 million yuan. 
  In addition, acid rain causes corrosion or fading of paints 
and organic coatings, weakens fabrics and causes them to fade, 
ages rubber and plastic, and degrades and destroys paper 
products, thus decreasing or eliminating their utility value. 
  3. Dying Lakes. Although no acidification of lakes has yet 
been found in China, bicarbonate levels in some reservoirs of 
the Jiajiang, Danleng and Mingshan regions (covering about 5,000 
square kilometers) have fallen to 0.5 meq/liter 
[milliequivalents per liter]; in the Zigong, Rongxian, Wanxian, 
Liangping, and Zhijiang regions (about 8,000 square kilometers), 
bicarbonate levels in some reservoirs are between 0.5 and 1.0 
meq/liter. Under the international Gallway standard, water 
bodies with bicarbonate levels below 0.5 meq/liter are 
classified as sensitive to acidification; those with bicarbonate 
levels above 0.5 meq/liter are classified as not sensitive to 
acidification. Thus, the first group of reservoirs mentioned 
above is sensitive to acidification: owing to their low 
bicarbonate levels, they have a weak buffer capacity for 
resisting acidification and a latent proneness to acidification. 
The latter group of reservoirs is potentially sensitive. Thus, 
the problem of acidification of lakes must not be ignored. 
  4. Decreased Crop Yields. When acid rain falls, the leaves 
of 
crops are the first to be damaged. Rusty spots appear on them 
and they turn yellow. Their absorptive ability and 
photosynthetic ability are weakened, and the internal 
organization of the leaves is damaged, resulted in the leaching 
out of sugars, amino acids, and pectin and retarding their 
growth. Acid rain also decreases the sprouting rate of seeds and 
the root development of plants; and because the absorptive 
ability of soils is decreased, seedling growth is slow and crop 
yields fall. On 15 March 1979, a fall of acid rain that occurred 
in a zone including the Fenghuang, Changsha and Xiangtan areas 
of Hunan Province and the Songtao region of Guizhou Province 
caused a major decline in crop yields over an area of 350 square 
kilometers. 
  Acid rain leaches such inorganic components as potassium, 
calcium and magnesium from the soil and can decompose rock, 
alter soil components, accelerate the leaching of potassium and 
magnesium and promote wind erosion of the soil; it can depress 
the vital activity of microorganisms, slow the degradation of 
organic matter, and cause a decline in soil fertility, which 
also decreases crop yields. According to Ministry of Agriculture 
statistics, 5.3 million hectares of agricultural land in China 
is affected by acid rain and fluorine pollution, and the annual 
loss of grain output exceeds 6.3 billion kilograms. 
  As the acidity of precipitation increases, toxic metals such 
as aluminum, mercury, cadmium and lead can be leached from rocks 
or the soil and can be absorbed by plants. Elevated cadmium 
levels have been found in plants of the lettuce family. Toxic 
metals in vegetables and fruits may not affect yields, but they 
do lower the food value of produce and may make it inedible.

4850 3466], Ecological and Environmental Research Center, CAS, 
Beijing: "Nitrous Oxide Emission Levels in China"; manuscript 
revised 24 Nov 1992] 
  [Excerpts] Abstract -- The sources and magnitudes of 
nitrous oxide emissions in China are described and analyzed. The 
annual emission of nitrous oxide in China is 950 gigagrams (as 
nitrogen), equivalent to about 6 percent of the world total. 
Natural sources account for 71 percent of the total and human 
sources for 29 percent. The primary natural source is the sea, 
and the most important human source is the combustion of coal. 
It is calculated that in the next few years the rate of increase 
of N2O emissions will be 6 gigagrams per year (as 
nitrogen) 
  Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important atmospheric 
trace gas which both contributes to the greenhouse effect and 
can destroy ozone in the stratosphere. Atmospheric 
N2O levels have increased greatly from their 
pre-Industrial Revolution levels, reaching 310 ppbV in 1990, and 
the annual rate of increase is now between 0.2 and 0.3 percent. 
Although N2O makes a major contribution to global 
environmental change, there are still difficulties in 
identifying and quantifying its sources. It was formerly 
believed that the use of agricultural fertilizers and the 
combustion of fossil fuels were the factors causing global 
N2O levels to rise. But recent research has shown 
that the results of earlier calculations were overstated, and as 
a consequence, more detailed efforts to identify N2O 
sources and to forecast N2O concentrations are being 
made. 
  Because N2O levels vary from region to region and 
from country to country, any limits imposed on its emission must 
take account of the particular conditions of each country. 
Calculated country-by-country or region-by-region emission 
figures are of great importance in the development of 
appropriate control policies in each country and are also of 
great reference value in calculating the global N2O 
budget. Since China is a large, developing nation, the trace 
gases emitted by its industry and agriculture may constitute an 
important fraction of total global emissions of greenhouses 
gases. Wang Mingxing [3769 2494 2502] has made an estimate of 
methane emissions in China, but there have been relatively few 
efforts to determine the emission sources of other trace gases 
in China. In this paper, using domestic statistics and following 
the most recent OECD methodology for calculating trace gas 
emissions, we analyze domestic N2O sources and their 
relative contributions. 
  Nitrous oxide emissions can be classified as natural and 
manmade. Among the natural sources, we shall concentrate on 
emissions from soil and water. Table 1 gives statistics on 
N2O emissions in China, classified by source. 
<H5>  Table 1 </H5>
  3. Annual Change in N2O Emissions 
  Human activity has altered the global environment and is 
producing a great effect on atmospheric N2O levels. 
Changes in the natural environment and the development of 
industry and agriculture have caused fluctuations in emissions 
by various N2O sources. Below we shall present crude 
estimates of the changes in N2O sources that are 
likely to result from various factors in the next few years 
(Table 2). 
  In China, housing construction, desertification and other 
land-use factors are causing a gradual decrease in the arable 
land area, which may cause a decrease in N2O 
emissions from the soil. It is estimated that an annual decrease 
of 5 million hm[.sup]2[/] in the area of arable land and 
grassland will result in an annual decrease of 3.0 Gg 
(gigagrams) in N2O [here and below, all figures for 
nitrous oxide are expressed as nitrogen]. But with accelerated 
economic development, the consumption of fossil fuels will rise 
steadily, producing an increase in N2O emissions. 
The combustion of coal, oil and natural gas in stationary 
facilities will cause increases of respectively 2.8, 0.3, and 
0.03 Gg of N2O per year, for a total of 3.1 Gg. 
Similarly, the total N2O emissions from mobile 
sources will increase by 0.3 Gg. An annual increase of 1.4 x 
10[.sup]8[/] kg in fertilizer use will cause direct release 
of 1.6 Gg N2O from the soil, together with the 
emission of 1.6 Gg of N2O from groundwaters. The 
burning of straw from crops will produce an annual increase of 
2.3 Gg N2O per year; but this is an upper limit: 
because the energy structure of agriculture is changing and 
fossil fuels are gradually replacing plant fuels as an energy 
source, in the next few years N2O emissions should 
increase by about 6 Gg. 
<H5>  Table 2. </H5>
  4. Conclusions. Our analysis indicates that the total amount 
of N2O emitted in China is 950 Gg per year (as 
nitrogen), with natural and manmade sources accounting for 
respectively 71 and 29 percent of the total. It is reported that 
the total world emission of N2O is 14 to 15 Tg 
(teragrams). Thus, China's N2O emissions account for 
about 6 percent of the world total. The calculations show that 
China's N2O emissions are primarily from natural 
sources, chiefly marine sources. Because China burns very large 
amounts of coal, this source represents a rather large fraction 
of manmade N2O emissions. Owing to changes in 
various factors, in the next few years the net annual increase 
in N2O emissions will be 6 Gg N2O.

Soil and Water Conservation Institute, CAS: "Ecological and 
Environmental Disasters During the Economic Development of 
Northwest China and Strengthened Measures to Deal with Them"] 
  [Text] Northwest China comprises Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, 
Qinghai and Xinjiang provinces. Its total area of 3.03 million 
square kilometers represents 31.6 percent of the country's land 
area, and its 11 million hectares of arable land represents 12 
percent of the national total. Its population is 74.92 million, 
7 percent of the country's total, and includes an agricultural 
population of 58.75 million, 6.8 percent of the country's total. 
The amount of wasteland that could easily be brought under 
cultivation is roughly equivalent to the current area of 
cultivated land. Northwest China is the main pasturing and 
livestock-raising area of China, with 110 million ha of usable 
grassland, constituting 33 percent of the country's total; it 
also has 14 million ha of forest land, or 11.9 percent of the 
national total. Although the area has vast land resources, 
hard-to-use deserts and barren hills now represent 50 percent of 
its total area. The region contains an important part of China's 
supplies of coal, petroleum, natural gas, rock salt, and 
nonferrous metals. With the rapid development of the national 
economy, various types of irrational human activities will 
intensify, and ecological and environmental disasters will grow 
increasingly serious, causing harm to the economy. 
  I. Principal Aspects of Environmental Disasters in Northwest 
China 
  Some aspects of environmental disasters in Northwest China 
are a historical legacy, while others are the result of 
human-caused damage to the ecology and environment. As people 
have come to take ecological development more seriously, and as 
environmental awareness has increased, environmental development 
in the northwest has made some progress. But the problem of 
ecological and environmental damage has not been brought 
thoroughly under control, and eco-environmental disasters are 
becoming increasingly serious. They have become the limiting 
factor on economic growth and they threaten the conditions of 
life: thus they have reached the alarm stage. The principal 
types of ecological disasters are as follows. 
  A. Serious Damage to Vegetation 
  1. Damage to Forests and a Decrease in the Forested Area -- 
Damage to forests is the principal culprit in creating an 
ecological and environmental imbalance. The region has a 
harvestable forested area of 13.7 million ha, or 11.9 percent of 
the country's total forested area of 115.2 million ha. But the 
high elevations in the area and its cold, dry climate, with 
scarce precipitation, combined with human-caused damage to the 
region's ecology and environment, result in a very slow forest 
growth rate. The world average rate of forest cover is 22 
percent and China's national average is 12.7 percent. But as a 
result of serious forest damage, Northwest China's percentage of 
forest cover is only 3.28 percent, one of the lowest figures for 
any region of the world. 
  2. Excessive Cultivation of Grasslands -- The Northwest is 
China's main livestock raising area. Xinjiang, Qinghai and Gansu 
are three of the country's five major pastoral areas. Northwest 
China has a total of 1.133 billion ha of grassland. The 
currently usable natural grass areas total 106 million ha or 33 
percent of the national total. But most of the grasslands in the 
Northwest are arid prairie, desert prairie, or alpine 
grasslands; these areas do not have the lush appearance 
described in the old poem, "When the grass bends before the 
wind, you can see the cattle and sheep." The majority of the 
grass area is shortgrass prairie with a very low grass 
production rate. In addition, there has been serious human 
interference. Since liberation, a total of 3.4 million ha of 
grassland has been brought under cultivation in Xinjiang 
Province. For the most part, this was fertile, well watered 
land, and much of it served as winter and spring grazing land 
for livestock. When it was brought under cultivation, the 
livestock was displaced to poorer, more arid grasslands, and the 
change in land use and inadequate development measures resulted 
in a significant amount of desertification. A sharp decline in 
the area of grassland caused the grass production of Gansu and 
Qinghai to decrease by 20 to 40 percent. In the mid-1980's, the 
economic loss resulting from damage to the grasslands of 
northwestern China was 2.0 billion yuan in Xinjiang, 1.4 billion 
yuan in Qinghai, 900 million yuan in Shaanxi, and 200 million 
yuan each in Gansu and Qinghai (all in constant 1989 yuan). The 
condition of the ecological environment, with its damaged 
vegetation, continues to deteriorate. 
  B. Deterioration of Soil Quality 
  1. Intensified Erosion -- Erosion is one of the most 
troublesome aspects of damage to Northwest China's ecological 
system and is seriously affecting agricultural and livestock 
production and posing an increasing threat to human productive 
activity and to the conditions of life. Land areas suffering 
from erosion in the region already total more than 330,000 
square kilometers. Just in Shaanxi and Gansu, the annual loss of 
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium as a result of soil erosion 
is equivalent to more than 10 million tons of fertilizer, and 
1.358 billion tons of silt is carried annually into the Yellow 
River from these provinces, representing more than 84 of the 
total amount entering the entire river. The cumulative amount of 
silt in the lower course of the Yellow River is 400 million 
tons, 50 percent of which comes Shaanxi. Soil loss by erosion in 
Shaanxi Province exceeds 10,000 tons per square kilometer, and 
the area subject to catastrophic soil erosion is 44,000 square 
kilometers or 21.4 of the total area of the province. Of the 192 
reservoirs built prior to 1973, 41 (21.3 percent) are now fully 
silted up, and 40 percent of the effective volume of the 
remaining reservoirs has also been lost as a result of silting. 
  2. Spreading Desertification -- Northwest China has 149 
[as published; error for 1.49 million?] square kilometers of 
desert and gobi, or 15.5 percent of the nation's total. It is an 
arid or semiarid region, with precipitation of only 50 to 600 mm 
per year. These circumstances, combined with human-caused 
damage, are causing increasingly serious desertification. The 
area converted to desert is steadily expanding and already 
amounts to 23.80 million ha, in addition to which about 3.933 
million ha of farm land, 4.933 million ha of grassland, and 
2,000 kilometers of railway right-of-way are under the threat of 
desertification. The region east of the Helanshan and Wushaoling 
areas, and the mixed agricultural and pastoral region that 
extends from the Ordos to Ningxia, are in especially serious 
condition. Spreading desertification in Northwest China poses a 
great threat to hydroelectric plant construction and railway 
construction and is affecting the economic development of the 
Northwest. 
  3. Expanding Salinization -- The Northwest is the region 
of China with the most serious salinization problem. In a large 
part of the affected area, the plow layer of the soil has 
accumulated large amounts of salts; the salt content is 
sometimes 30 percent or more, producing large areas of salinized 
wasteland and converting the region to one of abundant 
halophilic vegetation. The area of salinized land exceeds 1.6 
million ha. Of this total, 1.22 million ha is in Xinjiang, 
accounting for 30 percent of its total area of arable land. 
Since the filling of the Baojixia and Fengjiashan reservoirs in 
Shaanxi was begun in 1971 and 1977, the groundwater level has 
been rising steadily, and in Fufeng County alone, 0.53 [as 
published; error for 5,300?] ha of arable land has become 
salinized, with an average grain yield of less than 1500 kg/ha. 
  C. Frequent Natural Calamities 
  As a result of ecological degradation, natural disasters 
have 
become more serious. The principal such disasters in the 
northwest are drought, hail, high winds, flooding, landslides, 
and mud and rock flows. The frequency of drought is increasing: 
a minor drought occurs an average of once in 3 years, and a 
major drought once in 7 years. The area of farmland in Shaanxi 
subject to drought increased from 182,000 ha in 1952 to 2.311 
million ha in 1990, representing 65.26 percent of the total area 
of arable land. In addition, the annual precipitation is largely 
concentrated between July and September, and as a result, 
torrential rains may cause flooding in mountain regions, along 
with landslides and rock and mud flows. 
  D. Serious Shortage of Water Resources 
  Northwest China is the country's main arid and semiarid 
region. It has little precipitation, and the amount of rainfall 
varies greatly through the year. The bulk of the area has less 
than 400 mm of precipitation a year, and 2/3 of that area has 
less than 250 mm per year. Surface water consists primarily of 
river systems, which are dependent on replenishment from 
glaciers and snowpack. Groundwater supplies are also not 
abundant, and only a few regions can practice irrigation. In 
most of western Qinghai, the annual precipitation is only 25 to 
50 mm, and the precipitation in Toksun, Xinjiang, is only 3.9 mm 
per year, the country's lowest figure. The loess plateau belt 
that extends across Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia and Qinghai has very 
little surface water or groundwater, and in addition the terrain 
is complex and hard to use; as a result, irrigation water, 
drinking water, and industrial water are in extremely short 
supply. Although surface water is relatively abundant in most of 
the Qinbashan region, the area lacks high-quality level land, so 
that there is little potential for irrigated agriculture. These 
circumstances, in combination with human impact, the lack of 
scientific awareness, and ill-considered mass-scale projects, 
are producing numerous problems in the use of water resources. 
Chief among them are: (1) Inefficient use of water on the upper 
and middle sections of rivers, including excessive irrigation in 
the upper sections, which causes a lack of water in the lower 
sections of the rivers and produces desertification. On the 
upper Tarim River, the diversion of water for agricultural uses 
increased, and the water was indiscriminately dammed and 
withdrawn in the industrial areas of the middle section of the 
river, resulting in an acute water shortage in the lower reaches 
of the river and making it impossible to bring new areas under 
cultivation. (2) Owing to inadequate protection of the water 
quality of lakes, some of the freshwater lakes in the region 
have received large discharges of clean but saline water, 
causing a decline in water quality. Because no thought was given 
to protecting the waters of Bosten Lake when the Jiefang No 1 
Canal and the Baolansu Dam were built, the amount of fresh water 
entering the lake is steadily decreasing, with an attendant 
increase in the proportion of high-salinity discharge waters 
entering the lake. As a result, the salinity of the lake's water 
rose from 0.38 g/liter in 1959 to 1.98 g/liter in 1992. 
  E. Uncontrolled Waste Disposal 
  Environmental pollution is becoming increasingly serious as 
a 
result of the irrational disposition of high-energy-consumption 
local industry and other types of local industry and small-town 
enterprises. The "three synchronizations" (of programs, design, 
and construction) were rather poorly carried out, and the 
discharges of solid residue and of liquid and gaseous wastes 
were rather large. In addition little of the waste was treated. 
As a consequence, the environmental condition of Northwest China 
has been worsening, and pollution levels in some regions are far 
higher than those in coastal regions or developed regions. 1. 
Solid Residue. Northwest China is the country's largest energy 
base, and during the extraction process, mining enterprises 
usually consider only their own immediate benefits, 
indiscriminately piling up or dumping tailings or waste rock. 
Shaanxi produces about 14 tons of mineral tailings and solid 
waste from coal pits, chemical engineering plants and mining and 
metallurgy enterprises a year. While 8 percent of this waste is 
utilized, most of the rest enters rivers and streams. 2. 
Wastewater. On the Yinchuan Plain in Ningxia, where there is a 
sizeable concentration of industry and industrial wastewater is 
used to irrigate farmland, it was found that of 39 samples of 
wheat, 41.0 percent were contaminated with the harmful metals 
lead and cadmium and 10.3 percent were contaminated with 
arsenic; of 29 samples of paddy rise, 44.8 percent were polluted 
with lead, 41.4 with cadmium, and 6.9 percent with mercury. 
Nitrate pollution of such crops as chives, turnips, cabbage, 
rape, celery, spinach and radishes have reached levels that are 
cause for alarm. Some 24 percent of a group of soil samples had 
levels of cadmium pollution that exceeded the standards. The 
Yellow River too is polluted to various degrees. The main 
pollutants are: suspended matter, above the standard in 100 
percent of samples; COD [chemical oxygen demand], above standard 
in 83.33 of samples; phenols, above standard in 40 percent of 
samples; arsenic, above standard in 55.5 percent of samples; 
mercury, above standard in 11 percent of samples; and hexavalent 
chromium, above standard in 5.56 percent of samples. 3. Waste 
Gases. The principal waste gases are flue gas from the 
combustion of coal and such harmful gases as sulfur dioxide, 
which can form acid rain and can damage or kill forests and 
crops. The frequency, extent and severity of acid rain are 
increasing in Shaanxi Province. The frequency of acid rain in 
Shangzhou, southern Shaanxi, has reached 52.3 to 80 percent, and 
even Xifeng Peak, 2000 m above sea level in the Huashan range, 
receives acid rain. 
  II. The Human Factor in Ecological and Environmental 
Disasters 
  Protecting the ecology and environment is equivalent to 
protecting the conditions of life for mankind and for all 
vegetation. But the condition of the environment is still 
deteriorating in the Northwest. Natural disasters are 
increasing, torrential rains are more frequent in summer, and 
winter droughts are more serious; forests are being logged 
excessively, the country's land resources,are shrinking, 
indiscriminate cutting and overcutting cannot be controlled. 
Soil erosion is serious, producing a range of damage that 
exceeds control capabilities. Scientific and technological 
capabilities are weak, and new technologies and conventional 
technologies are difficult to disseminate. Environmental 
pollution by large industries is increasing steadily, and the 
harm done by pollution accidents is mounting, with the threat 
becoming steadily more serious. The rapid rise of low-level 
industry, with primitive equipment, outmoded processes, and 
inadequate management, combined with a lack of environmental 
protection awareness, has caused increasing pollution. When 
chemical fertilizers, agricultural pesticides, and plastic 
sheeting are used, they produce new and increasingly severe 
pollution. 
  The fact that the ecological system is made to produce high 
output while receiving low inputs is the primary factor 
responsible for damage to the eco-environmental balance. For 
many years, China's average investment in production industries 
that consume biological resources has been small, based on the 
belief that these renewable resources are inexhaustible. But the 
cumulative result over a long period has given rise to many 
human-caused ecological and environmental disasters. In forest 
management, the emphasis has been on logging, with a neglect of 
afforestation, and there has been overcutting of forest. More 
has been taken out than has been put in, and the practice of 
indiscriminate clear-cutting has left barren areas of wasteland 
and has damaged an increasing amount of the country's territory. 
In livestock grazing, the visible investment in building up and 
transforming grasslands has been insufficient. Their annual 
output value per hectare is an average of 15 to 23 yuan, but the 
annual investment per hectare is only 0.3 to 0.45 yuan. The 
great imbalance between inputs and outputs that results from 
insufficient investment is a growing trend. 
  In construction projects, there have been some rudimentary 
programs aimed at producing a beneficial ecological and 
environmental cycle, but they have generally been short-sighted, 
non-specific, unscientific, and infeasible. Many such programs 
have lacked any thorough systems-oriented preliminary studies 
that would have allowed the best program for integrated 
development to be chosen. As a result, in macroscopic terms, 
control was inadequate, and in microscopic terms there was a 
lack of specific detail. The result was that in the placement of 
municipal and rural construction and of industrial and 
agricultural production, and in the layout of the transport 
network, each project was usually a law unto itself. There was 
no careful, integrated provision for both the present and the 
long term, the particular and the general, the river basin and 
the local area, the main stream and side channels, the cities 
and the countryside. Administratively, there was no attempt at 
comprehensive consideration of mountains, waters, farmland, 
forest and roads; efforts to manage large and small river basins 
were not coordinated with each other; and it was very difficult 
to carry on integrated administrative measures. Ecological and 
environmental management was frequently plagued by lax 
observance of laws, failure to follow regulations, and 
inadequate management. 
  III. Stepped-Up Measures Against Environmental Disasters 
  We should step up integrated research and protective 
activities in order to deal with ecological and environmental 
disasters and to develop and utilize China's land resources 
rationally. We should readjust the structure of industrial and 
agricultural production and strengthen our ability to guard 
against ecological and environmental disasters. An ecological 
viewpoint should be used to guide disaster prevention measures, 
to decrease losses from eco-environmental disasters, and to 
increase the effectiveness of efforts to ward off such 
disasters. The following stepped-up measures should be taken. 
  A. Strengthen Environmental management, Improve Disaster 
Reduction Capabilities 
  1. Stepped-up Research, Integrated Preventive and 
Management Measures -- Stepped-up research on ecological and 
environmental disasters is a major task of the science of 
natural disasters in the 1990's. Environmental disasters 
constitute a global system of deterioration, which is made up of 
disaster-breeding environments, disaster-promoting factors, 
disaster-prone entities, and the disaster-causing events 
themselves. The social application of research into disasters 
should consists of efforts to lessen them. Thus, emphasis should 
be laid on the following theoretical subjects. (a) Investigation 
of eco-environmental disaster chains: while specialized research 
is important, integrated research is even more important. (b) 
Investigation of clusters of eco-environmental disasters: they 
occur in clusters both spatially and temporally, and an 
integrated investigation of this subject is also necessary. (c) 
Investigation of the mechanisms of ecological and environmental 
disasters: these include both disaster-causing mechanisms and 
disaster-promoting mechanisms, and environmental research 
dealing with regional eco-environmental disaster systems should 
emphasize their integrated mechanisms. (d) Research on regional 
disaster categories: disaster-prevention measures should be 
drafted on a scientific basis and should be geared to the 
disaster conditions of particular regions. (e) Research on 
eco-environmental disaster warning systems, with the purpose of 
giving timely predictions of disasters and minimizing the losses 
that they cause. (f) Major scientific investments in the 
prevention and management of eco-environmental disasters, and 
organization of a set of disaster evaluation systems, and of 
system science and system technology structures, uniting all 
three so that they work together to enhance research on 
eco-environmental disasters. 
  2. Raise Awareness, Treat the Land as Precious -- 
Protecting the land is an effective means of mitigating 
eco-environmental disasters. But the land resources of the 
Northwest have been damaged repeatedly by such factors as 
erosion, indiscriminate use of agricultural land, recultivation 
of waste lands, and cutting of forests, and policies that leave 
the land idle; the result has been a sharp decrease in the 
amount of arable land. The world per-capita area of arable land 
is 0.37 ha. The figure for Northwest China is 0.152 ha, but in 
view of the rapid population growth, inducing all peoples in the 
region to value the land highly is a top-priority matter. Some 
provinces or regions in northwestern China have declared "land 
alarm days," on which organizations at all levels include 
long-term tasks of carrying out the Land Law, the Water and Soil 
Conservation Law, the Forest Law, the Grasslands Law and the 
Water Law on the agendas of party committees and governmental 
bodies and in addition take steps to increase the land awareness 
of all cadres and of the masses. Along with mass publicity in 
all forms, plans should be made to hold basic information and 
training classes on national land resources. Focal-point 
training classes should be held for rural and village cadres in 
order to make them thoroughly aware of the essential fact that 
China has a large population and limited land resources and that 
China's reserve land resources are inadequate. 
  3. Focus on Propaganda, with Education as the Foundation -- 
Bringing about a beneficial ecological and environmental cycle 
is an immense systems undertaking and a basic means of 
mitigating eco-environmental disasters. We must rely on the 
combined efforts of the entire populace, propagandize and 
educate them, and use a variety of methods to increase 
awareness. The following steps should be taken. (a) Increase the 
ecology-mindedness of cadres at all levels and of the peasants, 
make use of oral presentations, pictorial propaganda, typical 
examples, visual education and the like to disseminate 
ecological information and to strengthen an 
environmental-protection orientation. (b) Hold classes on the 
integrated utilization of the ecological environment in 
institutions of higher education, make use of adult-education 
examinations, offer two-year specialized courses, and train a 
contingent of advanced research and management personnel. (c) 
Use workplace training, radio and television educational 
programs, agricultural correspondence colleges and peasant night 
schools to train a home-grown contingent of technical personnel. 
(d) Strengthen ecological and environmental research. (e) Set up 
an ecological and environmental monitoring network and increase 
its density, and gradually convert people from indiscriminate 
measures and passive adaptation to conscious adoption of 
protective measures and conscious reform. 
  In the development of the socialist market economy, we must 
deal effectively with numerous contradictions between economic 
development and the environment. We must guarantee the resource 
requirements for state construction, suitably develop the area's 
resources, and engage in optimal planning, scientific 
management, and coordination. If environmental protection lacks 
correct guidance, or if comprehensive management of industry 
programs, siting programs, product-oriented programs, 
environmental protection programs and basic construction are 
ignored, it is likely that the result will be significant damage 
to the ecology and environment. If so, then the numerous 
dispersed rural enterprises will become the chief rural 
polluters and will cause large-scale pollution. Therefore, the 
development of rural enterprises must promote improvement of the 
environment and protect the natural ecological balance. This 
will produce great social and economic benefits. 
  B. Protect the Environment and Promote a Beneficial Cycle 
  1. Afforestation and Intensification Activities -- In 1978, 
the state undertook the "Three Northern" protective forest 
program, whose objective was to bring about beneficial 
ecological and environmental cycles. By the year 2050, over an 
area of 4.069 million square kilometers in 14 provinces, 
regions, and municipalities, representing 42.4 percent of the 
country's area, a total of 0.251 [as published; error for 25.1 
million?] hectares of plantings will have been created, along 
with 275 [as published] ha of forest growth in closed mountain 
areas, which will essentially control erosion in the area 
covered by the project. Implementation of the program and the 
relevant construction activities are in full swing. 
Afforestation must be carried out in a manner suited to local 
conditions in order to bring about a rational distribution of 
forest plantings. In medium-elevation and alpine river-source 
areas, the focus can be on watershed forests; in low mountain 
and hill areas or denuded slope areas with severe erosion 
problems, the focus should be on water-protection forests and 
special economic forests. 
  2. Effective Rural Construction, with Conservation of Water 
and Soil -- The per-capita arable land area of Northwest 
China is 0.251 ha; the arable land consists primarily of 
low-productivity slope areas. Medium- and low-productivity areas 
account for 85 to 90 percent of the total land area, and 80 
percent of the area is subject to the "three losses" (of water, 
soil, and fertilizer), so that the potential of arid-zone 
technologies for increasing output cannot be utilized. As a 
result, rationally developing land resources is a top-priority 
matter. After slopes have been brought under cultivation, areas 
of gentle slopes must be reconstructed. The construction of 
basic plots is an important measure for strengthening the 
utilization of arable land. The construction of a variety of 
such basic plots, including level embanked areas, terraces and 
small furrow-irrigation areas can be carried on concurrently. In 
many areas, a variety of measures suited to the conditions may 
be used, such as building stone-reinforced terraces and 
walled-off terraces, building dams to create reservoirs, 
blocking gullies, and the like; of these measures, soil- and 
fertilizer-conserving terraces are the most effective. 
  3. Integrated Management, Thorough Development -- The basic 
type of landscape pattern in Northwest China is large areas of 
mountainous terrain with small areas of level floodplain; land 
resources are extremely scarce. Drafting programs for the 
rational utilization of China's land resources is of major 
importance for the thorough development of this region. In areas 
with severe environmental damage, a variety of measures must be 
used. (1) Intensified macroscopic land control, establishment of 
an effective land resource management organization, and vigorous 
overall planning for land resources. National land resource 
development programs should be included in the overall system of 
programs for the development of the national economy and 
society. (2) Diversified use of limited agricultural lands in 
accordance with local conditions, effective three-dimensional 
development, and maximization of the land utilization rate, the 
solar energy conversion rate, and the commodity up-valuation 
rate. (3) The fertility of large areas of barren land should be 
built up, stubble and straw from crops should be returned to the 
fields, and crop rotations that include the growing of grasses 
should be used to increase inputs into the land. Unused land 
resources should be put into use, and the renovation of medium- 
and low-productivity fields should be intensified, increasing 
their output per unit of area. (4) Develop both "channels and 
shoals," thoroughly use all available land resources, and strive 
for optimal resource utilization, optimum replacement, and 
maximum effectiveness. 
  4. Control Pollution, Clean Up the Environment -- The 
expanding range of human economic activity and its increasing 
frequency give rise to environmental damage and pollution. The 
administrative, economic, legal, and public-opinion dimensions 
must be used to bring about integrated control of pollution. 
Enterprises with outmoded processes that are heavy polluters 
may, as appropriate, be abolished, idled, merged, or 
respecialized; local sulfur refineries, paper mills and 
electroplating plants without environmental protection 
facilities must be put on a modernization program; new paper 
mills and electroplating plants that are capable of causing 
pollution and environmental damage too must be put on a 
modernization program. Construction projects and development 
projects that may cause environmental pollution or damage must 
be coupled with stringent environmental protection measures in 
order to prevent new pollution sources from arising. To deal 
with agricultural pesticides, pesticides that exceed the 
standards must be abandoned, with active development of new 
high-effectiveness, low-toxicity, low-persistence pesticides; 
the development and dissemination of microorganisms as anti-pest 
agents must be intensified, and biological, physical and 
chemical measures must be used to minimize disease and insect 
damage. The processes and technology of chemical fertilizer 
production must be modernized, and the output and quality of NP 
fertilizers and mixed fertilizers must be improved. 
  5. Broaden Sources, Regulate Flow, Decrease Water Shortages 
-- Water resource utilization should be put under comprehensive 
management in the context of an overall systems development 
approach. (1) Within a river-basin system, the legal regulation 
of natural waters and mountain areas and the centralization of 
water rights should be instituted, with consistent 
administration of the water resources protection law, 
unification of water rights at higher levels, and coordination 
of the higher and lower levels, with the higher levels having 
primacy; institute central distribution and central construction 
within the drainage-basin unit, rather than allowing all units 
to go their own ways. (2) In the integrated management of 
mountain areas, natural waters, agricultural land, forests and 
roads, it is waters, agricultural land and forests that are the 
main subsystems of the river-basin system, and they must be 
placed under integrated management. (3) Construction of mountain 
reservoirs, reconstruction of plains reservoirs. Since the state 
was founded, numerous plains reservoirs have been established in 
Northwest China, effectively promoting the regulation of water 
flow and the development of industrial and agricultural 
production. In the future, the construction of new mountain 
reservoirs will be considered, which should both assure 
sufficient regulation of river flow and provide resources for 
irrigation, electric power generation, and flood protection. 
This will be a key factor in regulation at the level of the 
entire river basin. 4. Draft effective river basin management 
programs. The hydraulic construction and water conservation 
departments should take the lead and should coordinate the 
efforts of the agricultural, forestry, livestock raising and 
water-management departments to establish an effective 
river-basin program and to carry on large-scale, planned, 
effective regulation.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Japan will strengthen a 
regulation on domestic transactions in ivory and crocodile skin 
as part of its obligations under an international treaty to 
preserve endangered species, Environmental Agency officials said 
Friday (915 April]. 
  The government endorsed at a cabinet meeting a plan to 
submit 
to the current Diet session a revised bill for preserving 
animals and plants facing extinction. 
  The revised bill regulates domestic transactions of parts of 
animals such as skin, plumes and bones, in addition to the 
bodies themselves, including stuffed ones. 
  The Washington Convention -- the Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora -- bans 
international trade in animal bodies and stuffed animals of 
species at risk. 
  Japan ratified the convention in 1980 and enacted a related 
law in 1987, which is the measure the government is now planning 
to revise. 
  The Environment Agency will introduce a measure to 
distinguish between contraband goods and ones imported legally 
before Japan started applying the Washington Convention rules. 
  The revised bill will require importers and processors of 
animal bodies to register and attach seals or tags of 
certification to each product, agency officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- With the "Green Round" 
multilateral talks just around the corner, the South Korean 
Government decided Monday to play an active part in global 
environmental activities and adopt world environmental standards 
in industry. 
  After a meeting of environment-related ministers presided 
over by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, the government said it 
would adopt as the Korean Standard (KS) to the norms on 
environmental management of the International Standardization 
Organization (ISO) which will be completed by 1996. 
  The government also decided to join the convention on 
biological diversity which has been in effect since last 
December, the Montreal Protocol and the Copenhagen Protocol or 
the Amendment to the Montreal protocol in the first half of this 
year. 
  The ministers said the country should join by May 15 the 
second term (July 1994-June 1997) Global Environment Facility 
(GEF), which was established with the aim of preventing global 
warming, protecting the ozone layer and world water resources, 
and preserving the diversity of species. 
  To that end, the government decided to contribute 5.6 
million 
dollars to the GEF. 
  In another effort to prepare for the upcoming Green Round 
negotiations, the government drew up a plan to reinforce the 
activities of "the task force for the international 
environmental management standards" set up at the Korea 
Employers' Association (KEA). 
  The government hopes that the task force's activities would 
lead industries to seek environment management systems. 
  Concerned that perhaps South Korea, sandwiched between the 
developed and developing countries, may not make itself heard, 
the ministers who attended the meeting agreed to carry out 
aggressive diplomacy to defend Seoul's interests during the 
Green Round negotiations. 
  The ministers also agreed to minimize trade regulations 
imposed in the name of environmental protection, given that free 
trade serves the causes of the world trade organization. 
  In addition, they decided to host the first 
intergovernmental 
meeting sponsored by the United Nations Emvironment Program 
(UNEP) to enhance cooperation in Northeast Asia. North Korea 
will also be invited to the meeting. 
  To join in global efforts to protect wild animals, the 
ministers will establish laws banning the sale of tiger bones 
and tiger-bone medicines by October this year. 
  Moreover, some 10 billion won will be provided to businesses 
for the establishment of recycling facilities and waste storage 
centers.

  [Text] Washington, April 11 (CNA) -- Representative Ding 
Mou-shih of the Coordination Council for North American Affairs 
Monday [11 April] expressed deep regret at the U.S. decision to 
impose trade sanctions against Taiwan for its alleged trade in 
endangered species parts and products. 
  "It is deeply regrettable that the United States has decided 
to rush ahead with sanctions against (Taiwan), despite the 
recommendation by the Standing Committee of the United Nations 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (to 
postpone sanctions)," Ding, head of Taiwan's non-official 
representative in the U.S. said in a statement. 
  He said that Taiwan has made aggressive efforts to eradicate 
the trade in endangered species, adding that "we are concerned 
that sanctions will cause an unnecessary negative reaction on 
the part of our people." 
  Ding added that the Executive Yuan has approved amendments 
to 
Taiwan's wildlife conservation law that significantly increase 
punishments for those convicted of trafficking in endangered 
species, and that these amendments are expected to be passed by 
the Legislative Yuan soon. 
  Taiwan has been conducting an island-wide crackdown on 
establishments suspected of selling rhino horn and tiger parts, 
he said. Of the 519 shops that have been investigated so far, 
six were found to be selling products containing rhino horn 
powder and 22 were found to be selling tiger products, he added. 
  Ding reiterated Taiwan's commitment to eradicating the trade 
in endangered species, and said he believes that dialogue and 
cooperation rather than sanctions are the best means of 
achieving progress toward the elimination of endangered species 
trade.

<F P=106> [Article by Y.C. Tsai] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs issued a three-point statement Tuesday [12 April] 
expressing deep regret and dissatisfaction over the U.S. 
imposition of trade sanctions on Taiwan's wildlife products. 
  On Monday, U.S. President Bill Clinton issued an order 
prohibiting import of wildlife specimens and products from 
Taiwan in retaliation for Taiwan's alleged continued trade in 
rhino horns and tiger bone. 
  The Foreign Ministry called the sanctions "obviously unfair 
and unjust," and criticized Washington for ignoring Taiwan's 
effort in wildlife conservation, which "is far greater than that 
of the neighboring countries or areas in this region." 
  The ministry, however, reiterated that Taiwan remains 
"determined and committed to the cause of wildlife conservation 
in spite of the unilateral U.S. sanctions. 
  Moreover, the ministry urged all ROC [Republic of China] 
citizens "to recognize the global trend of conservation and 
comply with the pertinent laws and regulations in full 
cooperation with the government by refraining from smuggling, 
trading, consuming, exchanging, or possessing endangered species 
and their derivatives so as to dissolve the international 
pressure of sanctions." 
  The sanctions will reportedly result in U.S.$20 million to 
U.S.$25 million in annual losses for Taiwan and will limit 
exports of farmed crocodile skins, orchids and farmed coral, 
local trade officials said. 
  Sanctions will take effect in 30 days and will continue 
until 
December 1994, when the U.S. will review conservation programs 
in Taiwan and decide whether to extend the import prohibitions.

  [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- It is extremely unfair 
for the United States to sanction Taiwan for its alleged 
continued trade in forbidden wildlife products, a Presidential 
Office spokesman said Tuesday [12 April]. 
  "The Republic of China [ROC] has not lagged behind other 
countries in preservation of endangered species," Raymond Tai, 
deputy secretary-general to the president, said after learning 
that U.S. President Bill Clinton issued an order on Monday 
prohibiting import of wildlife species and products from Taiwan 
in retaliation for Taiwan's failure to stop illegal trade in 
rhino horns and tiger bones. 
  "We have made enormous efforts to protect wildlife and have 
launched massive crackdowns on illicit wildlife product trade in 
recent years," Tai stressed. "The U.S. should not have used 
outdated data and photos to back its charges against Taiwan." 
  Tai reaffirmed Taiwan's commitment to stamping out illegal 
wildlife trade, saying the Legislative Yuan will soon pass a 
package of amendments to the wildlife conservation law that 
significantly increase penalties for offenders. 
  Premier Lien Chan also blasted the U.S. sanctions as "unjust 
and unfair," saying the U.S. should take note of Taiwan's 
progress in wildlife conservation and reconsider its decision as 
soon as possible. 
  Lien also ordered the Council of Agriculture (COA) to 
present 
within two weeks a comprehensive program for consolidation of 
rhino horn and tiger bone stocks, crackdown on illicit wildlife 
trade, wildlife product examination and conservation manpower 
training. 
  The COA has set up a special task force to intensify 
crackdowns on wildlife trade. COA officials said the United 
States has agreed to negotiate with Taiwan over wildlife trade 
issues. If the Legislative Yuan can pass the conservation law 
soon, the officials said, the U.S. may shorten the period of 
trade sanctions on Taiwan.

  [Text] Taipei, April 14 (CNA) -- Acid rain is posing a 
greater threat to Taiwan than ever before, according to the 
Environmental Protection Administration [EPA]. 
  An EPA official said the north of Taiwan was at greatest 
risk, but that the pattern exists around the island. 
  According to data collected by the EPA from 12 sites around 
the island from September [word indistinct] through March 1994, 
the rain falling at Wanli, a coastal township about 30 minutes 
drive from Taipei, was the most acidic, with an average pH level 
of 4.3. 
  pH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in 
water. The range of PH values is from 0 to 14. The pH levels 
from 0 to 7 indicate acidity, with 0 being the most acidic, and 
pH levels from 7 to 14 indicate alkalinity. A pH level from 6 
to 8 is considered safe. The pH levels in rain at all 12 sites 
the EPA kept statistics for were all below 6. 
  The EPA statistics show that rain falling at Wanli and 
Panchiao, a suburb of Taipei, [words indistinct] levels of 3.9 
in January, while Yangmingshan and Kuanying -- also in the north 
-- also had especially acidic rainfall. 
  The lowest levels of acidity in rain were found in Taihsi in 
western Taiwan and Taitung in the southeast. The pH levels 
there were 5.6 -- signaling a smaller threat to the environment, 
but a threat nonetheless.

  [Text] Thailand and Japan have agreed to cooperate in the 
preservation of biodiversity in accordance with the Earth Summit 
resolution. Director of the National Science and Technology 
Development Agency Yongyut Yutthawong has signed a memorandum of 
understanding with his Japanese counterpart to jointly implement 
the project to preserve biodiversity. According the United 
Nations Convention of Biodiversity, signed by 156 countries on 
29 December 1993, biodiversity will be strictly preserved at 
cooperative efforts among signatory countries -- Thailand and 
Japan included. Mr. Yongyut says the cooperation between 
Thailand and Japan will enhance the conservation and protection 
of biodiversity as well as reasonable utilization of flora and 
fauna, including equal sharing of benefit from the biodiversity. 
The two countries will exchange data, information, and 
researchers in the field of biodiversity.

<F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "Reserve Storage for Nuclear Fuel </F>
at Paks"] 
  [Text] Officials in Paks hope that, in accordance with the 
signed agreement, Russia will take the spent fuel from the 
nuclear power station in Paks. At the same time, due to the 
uncertain domestic situation in Russia, officials in Paks began 
preparations for the construction of a temporary storage 
facility, to make sure that there will be no need to stop the 
power station in case of obstacles in the transportation of 
spent fuel. 
  Although environmental protection experts in Moscow argue 
about the agreement to transport the spent fuel rods to Russia, 
Paks officials hope that the Russian side would abide by the 
agreement after all. At the same time, Balazs Kovacs, head of 
the information office of the nuclear power station in Paks, 
told us that, due to the uncertain situation, they are already 
prepared for the construction of a temporary storage facility. 
The fuel rods must be placed to lie dormant for five years in 
Paks prior to transportation to Russia. If they only keep adding 
spent fuel to the storage facility, it will become full by 1995, 
and if there are no other possibilities of storage, the nuclear 
power station will have to be shut down, a power station which 
supplies almost half of Hungary's need for electric power. It 
is not expedient to take such a risk and, therefore, 
preparations are under way in Paks to build a temporary storage 
facility. 
  As is well known, the joint English-French consortium 
Alsthom, a firm that has gained considerable experience in the 
construction of such facilities, won the right to construct the 
storage. The necessary environmental study has been done, and 
its evaluation is currently under way. Power station experts 
expect an answer in about one month. The technical plans are 
also being drawn now, but construction has not yet been started 
because there is no authorization yet. Only the land is being 
prepared for construction. 
  The experts are also conducting information activity among 
the people living in 12 settlements around the facility. 
Several people oppose the storage, and a civil movement against 
the storage has been formed. However, officials in Paks hope 
that they will succeed in convincing the opponents of the 
project that the facility is not dangerous. The hearing of the 
population is still pending, something required by law; no power 
station in Hungary can be built without this.

<F P=106> [Interview with Environmental Protection Minister Janos </F>
Gyurko by Janos A. Szilagyi; place and date not given: "No 
Breakthrough on the Bos Issue"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
  Szilagyi: After the fall of the 
Meciar-government, which represented a rigid position also 
regarding the Bos river barrage issue, many people hoped for an 
improvement in relations and progress in settling the Bos issue. 
Did the meeting in Bratislava justify these positive 
expectations? 
  Gyurko: Regarding the inter-ministerial 
cooperation, the Slovak side showed a constructive attitude. 
They showed a positive approach toward solving the common 
environmental and nature protection problems, and gave up the 
planned construction of the dangerous waste incinerator plant in 
Parkany, which would strongly pollute the air in the 
Dorog-Esztergom area. We decided to create a joint cooperation 
committee within 30 days to tackle concrete issues, a committee 
led by the two public administration state secretaries. I 
cannot report, though, on serious progress in the Bos issue. 
However, it is a promising development that these talks were 
held in a better atmosphere than previous talks. 
  Szilagyi: Did the two positions get closer to each 
other? 
  Gyurko: Very few concrete things were said, 
because the presentation of each side's position took up most of 
the time. At first, the Slovaks opposed the idea of maintaining 
the mediatory role of the European Union; instead, they 
suggested bilateral talks. Later, however, they gave up this 
idea. I made it clear that, at the talks on the distribution of 
water, we seek a temporary solution valid until the decision of 
the Hague International Court, and not a final solution. I also 
made it absolutely clear that Hungary continues to expect a 
solution to the problem from The Hague. I presented the latest 
decision of the Hungarian Parliament on the supply of water to 
the Szigetkoz area. In connection with this, I asked them to 
take concrete measures to protect the Hungarian natural 
environment and let more water in the main Danube and into the 
Mosoni-Danube branch. Mr. Hrasko promised to support the flow 
of some 20 cubic meters of water per second into the Mosoni 
Danube. This would signify definite progress in saving the 
Szigetkoz area, because we could redirect this surplus water in 
the various side branches of the Szigetkoz area and, thus, the 
costs of pumping would drop. [passage omitted] 
  Szilagyi: Did you also talk about the serious 
technical fault involving the sluice chambers at Bos and the 
subsequent halt in the navigation of the Danube? 
  Gyurko: The Slovak delegation said that the 
sluice chambers problem was an unpleasant development that came 
at the wrong time. It seems that the reports on the upcoming 
opening of navigation on the Danube are unfounded and it is 
possible that the repair works will last for another month. The 
task of the Danube committee may be to settle the issue and 
discuss the possible compensation demands. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Guadalajara, 11 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Cesar Robalino 
Gonzaga, Ecuadoran minister of finance and credit, signed with 
the IDB here today a contract for $14.9 million for an 
ecological protection program. 
  IDB Spokesman Carlos Brezina reported that the program is 
intended to reduce and control environmental damage in 
estuaries, mangrove swamps, and other natural resources along 
the Ecuadoran coast, as well as to strengthen the country's 
capacity to protect, handle, and rehabilitate coastal ecosystems. 
  Robalino said the program includes a subprogram to implement 
coastal resource development plans and to implement 120 projects 
for the administration of mangrove swamps and coastal areas, 
environmental cleanups, handling and conservation of marine 
resources, and community organization. 
  Brezina explained that the project's goal is to improve the 
economic opportunities of residents along the Ecuadoran coast 
and to increase revenues derived from ecotourism and aquaculture. 
  At the signing of the contract it was said the 2,860 km of 
Ecuadoran coastal line present [words indistinct] "conflictive" 
demands of tourism, the exploitation of shrimp and a [words 
indistinct], added that the project to be implemented by the 
Executive Directorate of the Program for Handling Ecuador's 
Coastal Resources will cost $16.5 million. Local funds for the 
project total $1.6 million. 
  The contract between the IDB and Ecuador was signed this 
Monday in Mexico's western city of Guadalajara within the 
framework of the 35th Annual Meeting of Governors of the 
institution. The meeting is scheduled to end on 13 April.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on environmental issues monitored through 14 April: 
<H5>  Argentina </H5>
  About 300 metric tons of garbage was shipped from military 
bases and shelters in the Antarctic to the port of Buenos Aires, 
the Argentine Navy reported in the last week of March. The 
garbage was brought by the icebreaker Almirante Irizar on its 
return from the 1993/94 Summer Antarctic Campaign. In a press 
communique, the Navy said the cleanup of Antarctic bases follows 
the strict international regulations on conservation in the area 
contained in the Antarctic Treaty's 1991 Protocol of 
Environmental Protection. The protocol was ratified by 
Argentina last October. The shipment included scrap metal, 
plastic, metal, food remains, cables, tubes, wires, and other 
materials used by workers. The waste will be dumped in 
landfills. (Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD in English 2 Apr 94 
p 5) 
<H5>  Brazil </H5>
  Japan has guaranteed Brazil $66.4 million for the 
Japanese-Brazilian Cooperation Program for the Development of 
the Woodland Savannah, Proceder. Of this, 80 percent will be 
financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, JICA, 
and the remaining 20 percent by private banks. The project will 
focus on an area of 80,000 hectares in the states of Maranhao 
and Tocantins, part of which will be used for agriculture and 
the other part for forest reserve, preserving the environment. 
(Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 1 Apr 94 p 18) 
  The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics has 
reported that 303 species and subspecies of the Brazilian fauna 
are in danger of extinction. Experts estimate that 24 of them, 
especially birds, are in serious process of extinction or could 
have disappeared. Areas of the Pantanal reserve in Mato Grosso, 
and the Amazon Basin are registering an increasing extinction 
process because of deforestation, indiscriminate burning, 
clandestine hunting and fishing, pollution of rivers, among 
other reasons. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2224 GMT 12 Apr 94) 
<H5>  Chile </H5>
  The Navy has ordered special emergency measures following an 
accident in which three containers with sodium cyanide fell into 
the sea. The accident occurred off (Tunquien Bay) near 
Valparaiso on 9 April. The containers fell from the Bahamas 
flagged ship Camina. (Santiago Television Nacional de Chile 
Imagen Internacional in Spanish 0100 GMT 12 Apr 94) 
  Chilean Agricultural Minister Emiliano Ortega on 8 April 
condemned the illegal destruction of a vast native forest in the 
Chilo region by the Philippine Golden Spring Forestal de Chile 
consortium and backed the $50,000 fine imposed on the company. 
Ecologist groups state that about 120,000 hectares of forests 
are destroyed per year. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2336 GMT 8 Apr 94) 
<H5>  Uruguay </H5>
  The Colonia City Hall has promulgated regulations to 
effectively preserve the native flora in Colonia department in 
keeping with the 1987 Forest Law. Severe sanctions are foreseen 
for those who violate the norms. (Montevideo LA MANANA in 
Spanish 29 Mar 94 p 35) 
  The National Farm Research Institute, INIA, and Botanic 
Garden representatives on 23 February signed an agreement to 
improve the native flora preservation and to promote rational 
exploitation. (Montevideo BUSQUEDA in Spanish 7 April 94 p 43)

<F P=106> [Report by Sunderlal Bahuguna: "Black Shadow of the Demon </F>
Named Development"] 
  [Text] The threat of the end of the human race caused by 
the neglect of our environment has not stopped. The past four 
decades of economic development have culminated in a global 
awareness, and the "State of the World Report 1994" has 
presented additionally some irrefutable and shocking facts. 
These became apparent at the meeting of the World Awareness 
Group, which has scientifically evaluated the developmental 
activities of the past four decades and has adopted the mandate 
to direct the course of action for the next 40 years. The 
administrators, policymakers, and sociologists of the world have 
been using this report as a path finder. It has been translated 
into 27 languages. Ten million copies of the English edition 
alone have been printed from New York, London, and New Delhi. 
Eleven hundred copies were distributed among world leaders 
participating in the recent International Financial Forum in 
Davos. 
  The first disadvantage of making economic advancement the 
goal of development has been an imbalanced and astounding 
grabbing for ownership of the substances that keep the earth 
alive. Before human intervention, the production capacity of 
earth-related materials from forests and pastures was about 150 
billion tons. Humans destroyed about 12 percent of this and used 
about 27 percent. Thus 40 percent has already been used up by 
humans, leaving only 60 percent for other living things. This 40 
percent is from that portion which was easily accessible to 
humans. Now, the trend is to reach for more and more. 
  What will be the result of this? When the forests are 
invaded 
too much, it impacts the water resources. In spite of the noise 
made about the preservation of forests, 130 million hectares of 
the world's forests have been destroyed from 1970-90. The 
majority of these were tropical forests, which were home to and 
a treasury of many varied species of flora and fauna. In 
destroying these forests, a delicate balance of biodiversity, 
forest resources, and a well-established eco-system of symbiotic 
creatures has been irrevocably upset. The procreation and 
natural balance has been replaced by a market philosophy of 
industrial production, based on human selfishness. 
Biotechnology, acclaimed widely as the hope of the future, is 
the biggest culprit as it sucks the earth repeatedly, until 
there is nothing left. 
  The same thing that was done to the forests has been 
repeated 
with farm lands. Four decades of development have been showing 
astounding food and other production due to the green 
revolution. Along with improved food grain production, meat 
production has also increased 2.6 times. 
  This would have made those pushing for advancement happy, 
except that after 1984 there was a sudden decrease in food 
production. The increase had been a direct result of 
improvements in irrigating and fertilizing techniques. A ton of 
fertilizer used to yield 9 tons of produce, but once the 
productivity zenith was reached, it fell to only 2 tons. Between 
1984 and 1993, the annual food production went down from 29 
million tons to only 12 million tons. In the next 40 years, by 
the year 2030, should the same condition prevail, the yield 
would only be 248 kg per capita, compared to the top production 
year 1984 with a per capita production of 346 kg. The 
fluctuation in food production directly impacts meat production. 
We must not assume wrongly that the per capita growth in food 
production has met food demands and has lead to self-sufficiency 
and uplifting of living standards of the poor. This 
misconception can be dispelled by looking at the per capita 
consumption statistics worldwide. The annual per capita food 
consumption for Canada was 974 kg, and for the United States, 
860 kg, when for India it was 186 kg, and for Bangladesh 176 kg! 
This striking difference is because those countries' greatest 
use of food products is to convert them into fodder for 
obtaining animal-protein in the form of meat, eggs, and milk. An 
American's average annual consumption includes 42 kg of beef, 28 
kg of pork, 44 kg of poultry, and 271 kg of milk, whereas an 
Indian's food consumption is mainly to wipe out hunger, and stay 
alive. 
  There has been an extraordinary increase also in fisheries. 
It had increased to an annual production of 100 million tons in 
1990, from a mere 22 million tons in 1950. The per capita 
consumption had risen from 9 kg per year to 19 kg, but now there 
is a marked decrease in this also. This has decreased to only 11 
kg per capita. The main reason for this is the pollution of the 
ocean floor from where 90 percent of the fish are obtained. 
  This picture of economic development makes it clear that our 
planet is hurtling towards its demise. The dance of death will 
be felt more acutely in the poorer nations since the peoples of 
these countries are more directly dependent for sustenance on 
water, forest, and earth resources. Converting to a market 
economy has brought about a basic change in their 
generations-old ways of living, and traditions. The temple of 
economics is the market and money its god. Even in this the 
place for foreign currency, especially the "dollar" has the 
highest place. The industrialized nations of the world have 
trapped the rest of the world into the spread of this snake's 
hood of market economy so that probably there is no nation left 
whose leader does not have to supplicate himself to this method. 
They are acquiring materials through free trade. Under this 
system it really does not matter who rules a country. Those who 
accept this way have only one rule -- economic slavery. It is 
clear from the examples of Japan and the Netherlands how 
countries that make trade their mainstay remain affluent, even 
when they lack basic natural resources. Japan sells cars and 
computers, and from that income buys food, wood, oil, iron, and 
other raw materials. The Netherlands uses 10 percent of its 
farm, pasture, and forest lands for production. Japan's annual 
per capita national production is $18,000. Japan's trade 
stretches far to Canada, whose forests have been leased by Japan 
for a long while now. The clearing of the tropical forests in 
neighboring East Asia is for its expanding self-indulgence, and 
to fulfill its commercial needs. The aborigines, who have 
already been rendered poor by deforestation, are being pushed 
towards starvation. 
  The exports and imports of these countries can show us how 
they keep their trade balanced. Holland exports milk and 
milk-products, while it imports the fodder for its cattle from 
far-off Thailand. India is a big importer of crude oil. In 
1989/90, we imported 5.460 billion rupees [Rs] worth of crude 
oil. There is a permanent goal to improve this. India is also 
importing the dung from Dutch cows, since there is a danger of 
Holland's rivers becoming polluted by it. These cows are sent to 
the slaughter-house anyway once they stop yielding milk. 
  The increase in population in the next 40 years will be 
significant. The world population has doubled in the last 40 
years from 2.50 billion to 5.2 billion. And every year it has 
increased by 70 million. The next 40 years are likely to see an 
increase to 8.900 billion. That means a yearly 90-million 
increase. The rate of increase in Western countries will be very 
low. In Russia and in Italy, the population will decrease by 1 
and 2 million, respectively. In the last 40 years in India, the 
population has shown an increase of 307 million, and an increase 
of 590 million is expected in the next 40. We will rank second 
only to China, as we already do, with a population count of 
1.443 billion. 
  The dreams of a comfortable life that poor nations dream and 
the promises of their governments of bright futures all will get 
crushed. During 1950-60, the rate of economic growth for the 
world was 4.9 percent and per capita was 3.1 percent. During 
1990-93 it dropped to 0.9 and 0.8 percent, respectively. It can 
be argued that these are global figures, and in a developing 
nation like India, the annual rate of growth has been higher. No 
matter how good the growth, the benefits from it reach only the 
handful of people controlling the power and the economies of 
these rich and poor nations. 
  These developments are issuing a warning to develop new 
methods of survival, other than those aimed at economic growth. 
It would be foolish to ignore this warning, saying that it may 
be a matter of choice for the rich nations to leave the path of 
prosperity through economic growth, but a poor country has no 
option and cannot give it up. 
  From the Himalayas in the north to the oceans in the south 
and east, I witnessed for one week (17-24 February) the 
battleground where this is being fought. In Tehri, the highest 
dam in Asia, at 260.5 meters, has been constructed, killing the 
effluent Bhagirathi river, submerging a 42 sq km plain, and 
uprooting 100,000 people. Why? To sustain big, mainly 
export-oriented industries; to provide a few more hours of 
electricity at night to the cities; to increase the production 
of exportable sugarcane in western Uttar Pradesh, which is 
already 100-percent irrigated; and to meet the increased demand 
for water of the fun-seeking tourists that come to Delhi's 
five-star hotels. In Medhak Zilla near Hyderabad, on 300 acres 
of farmable land, an Alkabir slaughterhouse with the capacity 
for killing 120,000 cattle has been built. In the seashore city 
of Tanjore, the granary of the south, fisheries are set up at 
the cost of destroying 10 thousand hectares of farmable land. As 
I coursed along the seashore to the north-east towards Orissa, I 
found that there also these fisheries have been established, 
destroying sealife and forests on the seashore. There is a plan 
to commercialize the seashore areas of Puri by constructing 
hotels for tourists. Delhi has announced agreements to export 
15,000 tons of buffalo meat every year to the Philippines and 
buffaloes to Vietnam. Animal and animal-product exports are 
going to increase from Rs3 billion to Rs20 billion per year. 
  Behind all these plans is the clout of influential political 
leaders, i.e., the elected representatives of the people of 
these regions. In the end, the result of such pressure cannot be 
anything other than the consumption of the very last lump of the 
flesh of silent nature and the silent millions with their filial 
dependence on her.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb 22 (PTI) -- The government has taken 
the first step to cleansing polluted stretches of 17 major 
rivers in the country by approving in principle an approach 
paper on the subject, the Lok Sabha was told today. 
  The implementation of schemes for pollution abatement would 
be taken up in 1994-95 in 46 towns in 12 states and would be in 
addition to the schemes approved for de-pollution of the Yamuna, 
Gomti and the Ganga, the environment minister, Mr. Kamal Nath 
said. 
  Studies to assess pollution loads have been taken up with a 
view to formulating schemes of pollution abatement in these 
cities, the minister said. 
  The 17 major rivers which would be cleansed in their 
polluted 
stretches include Sabarmati in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, Satluj 
running through Ludhiana, Jallandhar, Phagwara and Philur in 
Punjab, Subarnrekha flowing through Ranchi, Ghatshilla and 
Jamshedpur in Bihar, Godavari and Krishna running along Nanded, 
Nasik, Karad and Sangli in Maharashtra. 
  The stretches of the same rivers when they flow in the 
Andhra 
cities of Bhadrachalam, Mancharial, Ramagundam and Repalle. 
  In Tamil Nadu the Cauvery would have to be cleaned at Grant 
Anicut, Kumbakonam, Tiruchirapalli, while in Karnataka the 
Cauvery and Tungabhadra would have to be cleansed in the cities 
of Chickamanglur, Belur, Mysore, Thirthahalli, Bhadravati, 
Shimoga, Hogenakkal and Pagalur. 
  In Rajasthan the pollution abatement would have to be in the 
cities of Kota and Kesoraipatan where flows the Chambal river. 
  In Orissa the Baiterni and Brahmini would have to be cleaned 
at Chandbali and Dharamshalla.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 17 -- India has opposed the 
developed countries' move to link trade with environment, 
emphasising that GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] 
or any other forum -- trade or otherwise -- should not be 
allowed to review national developmental priorities. 
  Addressing a round-table discussion on `Perspectives of 
developed countries: environment and trade' at Geneva on 
Thursday, the minister for environment and forests, Mr Kamal 
Nath, said, "let not plain protectionism be passed off as 
environmental concern." 
  The round-table talks have been organised by the United 
Nations Environment Programme in coordination with UNCTAD 
[expansion not given], environment ministers of 15 countries, 
including the United States, the UK, Brazil, Malaysia, Norway, 
Austria, Mexico, India, Japan, and China are participating. 
  Calling for a moratorium on linking trade with environment, 
"unless it clearly impinges on collective ecological security," 
Mr. Kamal Nath said the environmental action" is to flow out of 
free will in an atmosphere of shared global concern." 
  He reminded the participants of the Agenda-21 agreed at the 
Rio Summit to stress that "we have to assidiously strive to 
ensure that any decisions which attempt to bring in 
environmental considerations to modify trade relations conform 
rigorously to the Rio consensus." 
  Mr. Kamal Nath termed the efforts to put environmental 
barriers on trade as a kind of "green imperialism" and said that 
the whole idea of international eco-labelling based on processes 
amounted to legitimisation of extra-territorial interference. 
  "We agree that environmentally-harmful processes must be 
stopped and that overexploitation of non-renewable resources 
must be controlled, but the solution lies not in unilaterally 
banning trade but rather in transferring technology and offering 
prices to developing countries for such commodities which would 
not then necessitate their over-exploitation or jeopardise their 
developmental priorities," Mr. Kamal Nath told ministers of the 
leading countries. 
  He explained that while dumping the eco-labelling schemes in 
some western countries which give value only to 
environment-friendly chemical dyes, they ignore natural dyes 
completely even though they are equally, if not more, 
ecologically sound. "Thus, Asian countries which are major 
manufacturers and exporters of textiles cannot earn an eco-lable 
which should rightfully be theirs." 
  Rejecting the developed North's concept of forest 
conservation which entails locking-up developing countries' 
forests and leaving them untouched, Mr. Kamal Nath said: 
"Forests in India are a community resource. These communities 
use forests, by and large sustainably. This may not fit into the 
western idea of conservation, and yet we maintain that so long 
as the use is sustainable, it does mean conservation. This 
exemplifies the contention that ... environmental standard or 
specifications are country specific." 
  In case of trans-boundary environmental effects, Mr. Kamal 
Nath said the "affected nations have the right and duty to 
safeguard their vital concerns." Where there are cases of 
blatant trans-boundary effects, such matters should be dealt 
with by genuine multilateral mechanism, the minister added. 
  Talking of product standards, Mr. Kamal Nath said while 
harmonisation of product standards if necessary, it cannot be a 
single standard on a global basis. 
  Different countries have different ambient levels of 
pollution, different environmental assimilative capacities and 
different social and economic problems and objectives. "It would 
be necessary to harmonise standards in groups -- the groups 
could be product-wise or region-wise or, better still an 
innovative combination of both these."

  [Text] Head of the nuclear safety research center of the 
Socio- Environmental Union Vladimir Chechetkin has expressed 
fears about a possible leak of liquid nuclear waste pumped into 
underground streams at a nuclear facility outside Krasnoyarsk 
named Krasnoyarsk-26. 
  In an interview with Interfax, he said that no thorough 
geological study of the area had been conducted though the 
underground nuclear waste storage at the Severny test site had 
been in use for 30 years. 
  Chechetkin does not rule out that the nuclear waste is not 
leaking out onto the surface through cracks. The test site is 
about five kilometers away from the Yenisey River, a fact 
causing particular worry by Russian environmentalists. 
  He also spoke of as many as 10 contaminated spots being 
found 
along the main pipeline through which the waste is pumped from 
the facility to the site, with radiation levels 200 times higher 
than normal background radiation. 
  Among other substances, the waste contains plutonium whose 
half life is 24,000 years. 
  Experts fear that contamination may spread over a larger 
area. This raises particular dangers in as the plant management 
obtained a licence for collecting wild berries, mushrooms and 
herbs there. 
  Chechetkin said that plans were under way to put up a new 
facility for reprocessing nuclear fuel and that the project 
provided for the burial of tritium at the Severny site. 
  He warned about dire implications from the continued pumping 
of liquid nuclear waste underground.

<F P=106> [Undated letter signed by "Experts on Nuclear Law "A. </F>
Ioyrysh, V. Kiselev, U. Margulis, V. Menshikov, Ye. Nesterov, A. 
Protsenko, Yu. Rogozhin, Yu. Fedulov, V. Filonenko, R. 
Sharafutdinov, and A. Shramchenko: "Nuclear Laws Have Been 
Written but Are Languishing in Parliamentary Archives"] 
  [Text] The history of civilian and military nuclear power 
dates back almost 50 years. But we still do not have a single 
federal legislative act directly regulating the use of nuclear 
energy. You get the impression that the legal vacuum here suits 
the competing branches of power, the nuclear power industry 
departments, and industry down to the ground. 
  Prior to the events of October 1993, one of the initiators 
of 
the systematic approach to nuclear legislation was the Radiation 
Safety Subcommittee of the Supreme Soviet Committee on Ecology. 
The subcommittee spent three years studying problems of nuclear 
and radiation safety in Russia and cooperated with the U.S. 
Senate and the European Parliament in this work. Its portfolio 
contained the most important legislative initiatives: a draft 
concept of the legal backup for the use of nuclear power, draft 
laws on problems of the treatment of radioactive waste, the 
application of nuclear technologies in the national economy, 
nuclear power station safety, and others. In conjunction with 
the draft Law "On the Use of Nuclear Energy," which was prepared 
by the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Committee on Industry 
and Power Generation, they could soon have become the basis for 
Russia's nuclear law. But they did not. 
  Today neither the Russian Ministry of the Environment and 
Natural Resources nor the government departments which deal with 
safety problems are showing the due interest in the continuation 
of that work. Clearly it is easier to live according to 
departmental instructions. As a result radioactive waste, for 
example, will continue to be poured into the ground and into 
water systems. The most dangerous products -- highly 
radioactive liquid waste -- will be buried deep in the earth as 
a "gift" to future generations. 
  Clearly it does not make sense for the State Duma to begin 
entirely from scratch and it is necessary to make use of the 
existing draft documents. 
  What are the most important principles that we propose, 
insisting on the systematic regulation of legislation in the 
sphere of the use of nuclear energy? 
  1. In the use of nuclear power Russia will be oriented 
toward the priority of protecting the health of the population 
and the natural environment over economic benefit; 
  2. The state will monitor the safety of installations using 
nuclear power regardless of their forms of ownership; 
  3. The regulation of safety and oversight in the sphere of 
the use of nuclear power both in the national economy and at 
installations of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry must be 
exercised by a single state organ; 
  4. The population and pubic organizations must take part in 
the discussion of questions of ensuring safety in the use of 
nuclear power and this participation must be enshrined in law; 
  5. A triad consisting of a federal organ, a component of the 
Federation, and organs of local self-government must take part 
in the solution of the most important questions (the siting of 
nuclear power stations and the storage of radioactive nuclear 
waste); 
  6. The final decision on the siting of potentially hazardous 
installations using nuclear power must take the population's 
opinion into account; 
  7. The departmental norms must unconditionally be based on 
federal laws of the Russian Federation. 
  After the effective blocking of nuclear legislation in the 
Supreme Soviet, the adoption of the Russian Federation 
Constitution, and the subsequent hiatus in the legislative 
organ's activity, the time has come for those departments which 
use nuclear power to finally realize that the present situation 
is intolerable. The government must exercise its right to 
initiate legislation in this sphere. 
  As a result of U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Russia 
and the subsequent accords on deliveries of enriched uranium to 
the United States, the Ministry of Atomic Energy could become 
the largest holder of hard currency. It is to be hoped that at 
least a small proportion of the resources earned at 
installations which represent an enhanced danger to the 
population and the natural environment will be allocated by the 
Ministry of Atomic Energy to the formation of a nuclear law. 
The atom will not remain without rights forever in Russia!

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report from Moscow </F>
Oblast's Polymetal Plant by L. Varebrus and V. Stupin, 
identified by caption; figures in brackets denote broadcast time 
in GMT in hours, minutes, and seconds] 
  [Text] [101254] Varebrus over video of padlock, 
barbed wire fence, and sign reading "Stop! No Entry!": 
Even today production facilities here are kept behind seven 
seals, and the barbed wire fence and awesome sign are no mere 
stage props. But there are no secrets behind these gates. 
There is waste ground. The gates are opened only very rarely. 
The predecessors of the present plant created a very dangerous 
neighborhood here -- a radioactive dump of their own waste, and 
what is more, directly on the banks of the Moskva river, as you 
can see. 
  Unidentified man carrying radiation counter: 
Right by the gate -- 10 microroentgen... Uh-oh -- 
132...520...divided by four that is 130. 
  Varebrus to camera over video of snowy landscape: 
Not a negligible quantity. Incidentally, this is not just a 
dump. The land belongs to the Kolomna museum. If you dig, you 
can find up to 1,300 microroentgen per hour. And on the surface 
up to 650. Not everywhere, of course. Just in certain places. 
Waste emitting more than 300 microroentgen is subject to burial 
at a special facility near Sergiyev Posad. Initially, nothing 
was known about this danger, subsequently it was kept secret, 
and now, when it would be possible to remove this filth -- 
uranium, thorium, and radium lie buried under the snow here -- 
the money has run out. So production managers from the present 
polymetal plant have themselves sounded the alarm. 
  V. Sotskov, deputy director for safety and emergency 
situations, identified by caption: The simplest solution 
would be if the waste could simply be taken away. But, as I 
have already said, it is technically impossible to dig it up, or 
cover it up somehow. The bank will be destabilized and the 
deposits will slide into the Moskva river. 
  Varebrus: True, the radioactive substances would 
not dissolve in water. But they would accumulate in the silt 
and pass into fish. And so there is only one solution -- look 
for and find the money necessary to protect our health. [101424]

  [Text] On 3 March, Deputy Zlotnikova sent a question to 
President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin regarding the 
location of radioactive waste on Russian territory and, in 
particular, on the intention of the Russian Government to accept 
a proposal by the Hungarian side to store radioactive waste from 
its nuclear power stations on the territory of Orenburg Oblast. 
On 8 April, the State Duma adopted a statement by the Yabloko 
Faction on holding parliamentary hearings on the matter in 
question in the near future. Here is Tamara Vladimirovna 
Zlotnikova, deputy chairwoman of the State Duma Committee on 
Ecology and member of the Yabloko Faction . 
  Zlotnikova: I received an answer to my question 
from the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy; the answer is 
striking not only in its environmental and economic illiteracy 
but, I would say, also, to a certain extent, in its cynicism. 
They write that the Hungarian waste will not be a significant 
addition to our own radioactive waste. The main aim, then, 
behind the signing of this contract is quite obvious, and it is 
a pity that strategic documents, especially ones that concern 
environmental issues, are not used as bases for making state 
decisions -- that is both the president's message on 
strengthening the Russian state in the area of ecological 
problems and the president's edict on the Russian state strategy 
on protecting the environment, which identifies the guarantee of 
the population's safety from radiation as one of the main 
problems in the realization of the constitutional rights of 
citizens of Russia to a safe environment. 
  The bluntly expressed departmental position of Minatom is 
being used as a basis for making decisions at the state level. 
And the main task of this agreement is the guarantee of a 
stable, long-term hard currency income, which will enable funds 
to be directed into rehabilitating territories [polluted by 
radiation]. Well, this is really a cannibal's point of view. 
First we poison the land and then we spend part of the currency 
we get on rehabilitating the territory. This is immoral as far 
as Russia's inhabitants are concerned. It is not only 
anti-ecological but anti-people. 
  And so, we got the support of the entire Duma. We are 
waiting for an answer from the president and from Viktor 
Stepanovich Chernomyrdin. We would not like to see Russia 
getting such anti- ecological presents from him. Therefore, the 
Yabloko Faction was unanimously supported by all of the Duma. 
No economic difficulties, even Russia's disastrous financial 
situation, can justify the signing of this protocol. It is 
unjustified from the points of view of the economy, politics, 
and the law. It would be immoral to turn Russia into an 
international waste dump.

  [Text] Announcer: The Chelyabinsk Oblast 
Administration has agreed to store radioactive waste from 
Hungarian atomic power stations. As our correspondent reports, 
the population has not been informed of this. It should be 
added that the relevant protocol on waste storage was signed 
last Saturday in Budapest by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov laid out the 
position of the president at a briefing today. [begin recording] 
  Kostikov: We are talking about the processing and 
utilization of waste from those atomic stations that were built 
according to Russian or Soviet, as they were then, designs with 
participation of Russian technology. The agreements signed back 
then obliged Russia to process, export to its territory, and 
store waste products. [end recording] 
  Announcer: In the meantime, Aleksandr Shuvalov, 
the head of the press service of Russia's Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, has the 
following to say: [Begin recording] 
  Shuvalov: References to the existing practice of 
accepting and storing exhausted nuclear fuel from the Czech 
Republic, Bulgaria, and Finland will not work in the given case. 
The agreement between the governments of the USSR and the 
People's Republic of Hungary of 22 December 1966 did not provide 
for importing nuclear fuel. The agreement left out this point 
and now attempts are being made to repair the omission. 
Decisions of this sort are making the already serious 
radio-ecological [radioekologicheskaya] situation in our country 
even worse and opens the door to a flow of other waste materials 
that are no less harmful for the environment. [end recording]

  [Text] An expert of Russia's Social-Ecology Union Marina 
Khotuleva told newspeople in Moscow that the radiological 
situation in different areas of the Russian Federation was 
complicated owing to the continued operation of the state 
nuclear complex facilities. More specifically, the 
environmentalists are worried about the situation at the 
chemical plant Mayak in the Chelyabinsk Region of the Urals. 
  According to the Social-Ecology Union, Mayak produces daily 
up to 100 Mn [million] curie [Ci] of radioactive waste and dumps 
more than 1 Mn Ci into the lakes Karachai and Staroye Boloto. 
The two lakes are responsible for the contamination of the 
region's underground waters. 
  Mayak operates in a zone of high seismic activity where 
earthquakes of up to 7 points on the Richter scale can take 
place, at the same time a number of man-made lakes with a total 
of some 400 cu m [cubic meters] of liquid radioactive waste in 
them have been dug out in the main flow of the Tech River. 
  The large amount of radioctive waste in the Cheliabinsk 
Region explains why there are 60 percent more cases of 
children's leukemia in Cheliabinsk-65 and Cheliabinsk-70, where 
Mayak operates, than in other industrial centers. 
  The Social-Ecology Union feels the region must be declared 
an 
ecological disaster zone.

"Is `Foreign' Radioactive Waste To Be Buried in Our Country?": 
"Position of the Ministry for the Protection of the Environment 
and Natural Resources: This Decision Will Exacerbate the 
Radiation Pollution Situation in the Country"] 
  [Text] The appearance of the government document to which 
was appended the draft protocol providing for the burial of 
vitrified radioactive waste on the territory of the Russian 
Federation came as a total surprise for the Ministry for the 
Protection of the Environment and Natural Resources 
[Minprirody], Aleksandr Shuvalov, head of the press service of 
Russia's Minprirody, told ROSSIYSKIYE VESTY's correspondent. 
Minprirody did not agree with the document in this form, and in 
principle could not agree with it in such a version. 
  Moreover, back in December 1993 the ministry sent its 
comments on the draft protocol, clearly stating the need for 
strict observance of the "Procedure for Receiving Spent Nuclear 
Fuel From Foreign Nuclear Electric Power Stations for Subsequent 
Reprocessing." Incidentally, this regulatory document was 
ratified by the Ministry of Atomic Energy and completely 
unambiguously requires reprocessed spent nuclear fuel to be 
returned to the supplier. 
  Strictly speaking, there is nothing surprising in the stance 
taken by the environmental protection organs. They dismiss out 
of hand any idea connected with the burial of radioactive waste 
-- indeed, of any other toxic waste -- in our country. 
Moreover, a legal norm also exists -- in the Law "On the 
Protection of the Natural Environment," Article 50 of which 
expressly forbids "the importation of radioactive waste or 
materials for the purpose of storage or burial." And references 
to the existing practice of receiving and burying spent nuclear 
fuel from the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and Finland, do not 
apply in this case, since this practice is based on agreements 
concluded before the adoption of the law, and which therefore do 
not come under that law. 
  In the agreement with Hungary the clause on the acceptance 
of 
nuclear fuel was "omitted." And now attempts are being made to 
repair this omission by means of the enticement that this is 
very profitable for Russia. Yet the latter argument is highly 
dubious. What is beyond doubt is that such a decision would 
exacerbate the already serious radioactive pollution situation 
[radioekologicheskaya obstanovka] in our country and open a 
"door" through which other waste, no less harmful to the 
environment, will flood in. And then what? We buy a clean 
environment on import, perhaps...? 
  The agreement on the burial of nuclear waste on Russian 
territory signed by Viktor Chernomyrdin in Hungary is within the 
framework of the obligations which Russia, as the USSR's 
successor, must fulfill. The head of state's press secretary 
Vyacheslav Kostikov set out this position at a briefing in the 
Kremlin at the request of the Russian Federation president and 
prime minster. 
  In Kostikov's words, the agreement signed in Hungary 
concerns 
the reprocessing and recycling of nuclear waste from nuclear 
electric power stations built to Soviet plans and using Soviet 
technologies. "As soon as the international treaties elapse, 
Russia will avoid concluding such agreements," Vyacheslav 
Kostikov remarked.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Position of the Russian </F>
Ministry of Atomic Energy" rubric and the general heading "Is 
`Foreign' Radioactive Waste To Be Buried in Our Country?": "The 
Protocol Does Not Run Counter to Russian Legislation"] 
  [Text] The protocol to the existing intergovernmental 
agreement of 28 December 1966, which was signed 1 April 1994 by 
Minister Viktor Mikhaylov on behalf of the Russian Federation 
Government, juridically confirmed the fulfillment by Russia, as 
the state taking over from the USSR, of the obligations to 
Hungary which existed prior to 1991. 
  In accordance with the protocol: 
  "The appropriate organizations of the Russian Federation 
pledge to supply, and organizations of the Republic of Hungary 
to purchase, nuclear fuel in the form of ready-made fuel 
assemblies and control assemblies throughout the period of 
operation of the `Paks' Nuclear Electric Power Station in the 
volumes necessary for the annual recharging of the reactors." 
  "The appropriate organizations of the Russian Federation 
will 
accept spent nuclear fuel from the `Paks' Nuclear Electric Power 
Station in the form of fuel assemblies and control assemblies, 
after being held for five years at the `Paks' Nuclear Electric 
Power Station, throughout the period of operation of the `Paks' 
Nuclear Electric Power Station on terms analogous to the 
acceptance of spent nuclear fuel from other countries under 
intergovernmental agreements concluded by the USSR prior to 
1991," i.e. prior to the Russian Federation's adoption in 
December 1991 of the Law "On Protection of the Natural 
Environment," whose Article 50, Point 3 prohibits the 
importation of radioactive waste and materials from other states 
for purposes of storage and burial unless an international 
treaty concluded by the Russian Federation lays down other rules 
(Article 93). 
  The Russian Federation president's Edict No. 472 "On the 
Russian Federation's Fulfillment of Intergovernmental Agreements 
on Cooperation in Constructing Nuclear Electric Power Stations 
Abroad" appeared in April 1993 for the purpose of resolving 
questions relating to previously concluded treaties. The edict 
confirmed (Point 1) Russia's fulfillment of the USSR's 
obligations under intergovernmental agreements on cooperation in 
constructing nuclear electric power stations abroad concluded 
prior to 1991, including in the sphere of the delivery of 
nuclear fuel and the return of spent fuel from these nuclear 
electric power stations to Russia for processing, entrusted 
(Point 2) the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, Ministry of the 
Environment and Natural Resources, Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Federal Inspectorate 
for Nuclear and Radiation Safety with drawing up and approving 
the procedure for accepting spent nuclear fuel from foreign 
nuclear electric power stations for subsequent processing at 
Russian enterprises, and also instructed the Russian Ministry of 
Atomic Energy and Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations (Point 
4), when concluding corresponding contracts with foreign 
clients, to proceed from the premise of the 
preferential return to the client country of the 
solidified radioactive waste formed during processing. 
  The "Procedure for Accepting Spent Nuclear Fuel from Foreign 
Countries' Nuclear Electric Power Stations," agreed with all the 
aforesaid departments, was drawn up and approved in 1992 in full 
accordance with the edict. It is of fundamental importance to 
emphasize that the edict enshrined the legal possibility of 
making exceptions from the general rule for the Russian Ministry 
of Atomic Energy and Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations in 
respect of the return of solidified radioactive waste to the 
client. Thus, such an exception was agreed when spent nuclear 
fuel was imported from Hungary in 1993 in connection with the 
Hungarian prime minister's appeal to the chairman of the Russian 
Federation Government with regard to the critical situation 
concerning fuel at the "Paks" Nuclear Electric Power Station. 
The Russian Federation's refusal to accept the said materials 
would be a violation of our obligations, particularly the July 
1986 contracts concluded with the "Paks" Nuclear Electric Power 
Station on the basis of the USSR Government's decree. Such 
actions would undermine Russia's international authority as a 
reliable partner which strictly fulfills the international 
obligations assumed prior to 1991 and would contribute to the 
loss of an important East European market for our industry. 
  Wherever our country has helped to construct nuclear 
electric 
power stations (the CEMA countries of East Europe and Finland), 
Soviet plans have been employed in respect both of the use of 
fresh fuel and of the return of spent fuel to the USSR for 
processing, pursuing, inter alia, the aims of the Treaty on the 
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Technologies. 
  It must be borne in mind that Western firms (Westinghouse, 
Siemens, EDF, and others) are today actively offering their 
services in the construction and modernization of nuclear 
electric power stations and deliveries of nuclear fuel, actively 
squeezing Russia out of the East European market for nuclear 
fuel. 
  It should be pointed out that Britain and France also offer 
extensive services in processing spent nuclear fuel to other 
countries (chiefly West European ones). France also carries out 
large volumes of work on processing such fuel under a contract 
with Japan. 
  During the processing of spent fuel, isotopes of uranium and 
plutonium are extracted for subsequent use in nuclear power 
generation, while waste from processing is vitrified and put 
into lengthy storage. This technology has been developed and 
introduced in our country to ensure the work of all nuclear 
electric power stations with reactors of the VVER-440 
[water-cooled, water-moderated power reactor] type constructed 
by us prior to 1991, with due regard for modern demands with 
regard to protecting the health of personnel and protecting the 
environment. 
  The signed protocol to the 1966 agreement confirms the 
economic relations which took shape between Russia and Hungary 
prior to 1991 and does not run counter to Russian legislation or 
the Russian Federation president's Edict No. 472 of 21 April 
1993, and all the necessary procedures were observed in its 
preparation, including agreeing it with the region in accordance 
with Article 9 of the Law "On Protection of the Natural 
Environment." It ensures the protection of Russia's economic 
and political interests in East Europe and makes it possible, 
inter alia, to resolve the problem of rehabilitating territories 
polluted by industrial activity in the past and of implementing 
the program for handling radioactive waste. 
  Therefore all attempts to cast doubt on the Russian 
Federation Government's decision are unfounded and have nothing 
in common with Russia's interests apart from the desire alone to 
politicize the situation in the country.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Karlov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- "Grave indications of 
serious medical aftermaths, caused by the irradiation of human 
beings, have appeared eight years after the Chernobyl disaster," 
ITAR-TASS was told today by staff members of the Medical 
Radiology Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences. 
  As many as 517 people, afflicted by radiation, were found in 
58 Russian cities, including Novgorod, Izhevsk, Elista, Kurgan, 
Novosibirsk, Omsk, and Khabarovsk. But the Chernobyl zone of 
contamination remains most threatening. It embraces 17 regions 
of Russia with a total population of more than two millions. 
Some children were found to be suffering form cancer of the 
thyroid gland in those areas. In normal conditions there are 
only a few cases of this ailment per million of children. 
Today, the incidence of this terrible disease has increased 
more than 20-fold in Gomel and Bryansk regions. Specialists 
forecast a sharp growth of this disease in Kaluga, Tula, and 
Oryol regions. 
  But Chernobyl is not the only danger zone in Russia. The 
second vast area of contamination is the southern part of the 
Urals. Several accidents there have been contaminated with 
strontium-90 radionuclides in an area of 2,000 square 
kilometres, inhabited by 300,000 people. 125,000 more people 
were irradiated by discharges of radioactive wastes into local 
rivers. 
  The third territory is in the southern part of Siberia, 
contaminated by the fallout of nuclear tests on the 
Semipalatinsk testing ground, where 467 nuclear devices were 
touched off in the course of fourteen years. Loyal to their 
"internationalist duty", Soviet servicemen carried out nuclear 
bomb tests only on days when the wind was blowing from China 
towards Altay territory, Kemerovo, Orenburg, and Novosibirsk 
regions. The population of those areas is now consuming 
contaminated meat and milk. Due to the deteriorating economic 
situation, people are beginning to fish and hunt intensively in 
contaminated woods. They are also consuming wild mushrooms and 
berries, picked in contaminated forests and meadows. 
  New methods of measuring the "average doses" of irradiation 
were developed during the period that has elapsed since the 
Chernobyl disaster. Measuring "average" doses in populated 
localities is the same as measuring the "average temperature" of 
patients in a hospital ward. Even in populated localities, 
where the "average dose" is normal, there will always be people 
with large doses of irradiation, making up the principal risk 
group. 
  Millions of people have suffered through the fault of the 
state. This is why the state must fulfill its commitment to 
lower to the maximum the consequences of contamination. But the 
Finance Ministry is now planning to sharply reduce or stop the 
allocation of funds for the Chernobyl programme. This will 
accelerate the already looming extinction of the nation's gene 
pool.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Nikolay </F>
Geronin] 
  [Text] Moscow April 18 ITAR-TASS -- The area of the Sea of 
Japan in which the Russian Pacific Fleet dumped some of its 
radioactive wastes does not show above-normal levels of 
radioactivity, according to preliminary data released by a joint 
Russian-japanese-South Korean expedition which just finished 
studying the area. 
  Russian Naval Captain Gennadiy Vorobyev, deputy head of the 
radiation and chemical security department, told ITAR-TASS on 
Monday that during the month-long expedition, Russian, Japanese 
and South Korean scientists took samples of sea water from their 
base onboard the research ship "Okean", which belongs to the 
Russian federal hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring 
service. 
  The expedition's work was prompted by the worries of several 
countries in the region that the dumping of radioactive 
materials in the Sea of Japan by the Russian Pacific Fleet in 
October, 1993, might lead to higher radiation levels.

  [Text] The radioactive situation in the Tomsk region, where 
the Siberian chemical plant is situated, is very complex; 
several territories are contaminated with Plutonium-239 and 240 
as a result of numerous discharges from this enterprise, Marina 
Khotuleva, expert of the Radioecological Research Center of the 
Social- ecological union, declared to Interfax. 
  In her words, contamination of territories located nearby 
the 
Siberian chemical plant in Tomsk-7 exceeds the background 
contamination several times, in some places it is 3000 
becquerels per sq.meter. 
  "Discharges of radioactive water from the plant into the Tom 
river have resulted in its contamination with radionuclides 
Cobalt- 60, Zinc-65, Manganese-54," said Khotuleva. 
  As she said, the Radioecological Research Center conducted 
an 
independent investigation of the consequences of the accident at 
the Siberian chemical plant which occurred on April 6, 1993 and 
found out that the territory was additionally contaminated with 
a short life cycle radionuclides, Ruthenium-103, Niobium-95, and 
Cerium-144. 
  Ecologists are concerned over the fact that liquid 
radioactive wastes are being pumped into the underground water 
layers for storage for a long time already. 
  As Khotuleva declared, a total of 40 Mn cubic meters of 
liquid wastes, including those which contain plutonium have been 
pumped under the ground since early fifties till now. "Nobody 
can rule out possibility that these radioactive materials can 
appear in reservoirs and in water supply systems intended for 
drinking," said she.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Mirnyy (Arkhangelsk region) April 18 TASS -- A 
programme for the environmental defence of the Russian north has 
been worked out by scientists working with the state strategic 
missile testing complex. The programme allows the military to 
estimate the damage caused to the environment by missile fuel 
and other harmful things, and to decrease the amount of damage 
caused to nature along the missiles' flight path. 
  "600 rocket and rocket-carrier launchings have been made in 
the last ten years. That is what forced us to start researching 
environmental problems", ITAR-TASS was told by Colonel Viktor 
Omelchenko, head of the testing area's computer centre. 
  The programme was worked out by the testing area's leading 
specialists and is a data and reference system which shows which 
areas are most subject to damage and the various levels of 
pollution. On the basis of such statistics, conclusions may be 
drawn and certain steps undertaken. The programme is unique, 
since it is concentrated on a concrete area, the environmentally 
fragile Russian north. 
  According to Omelchenko, Russian cooperation with American 
military scientists has led to great interest in the latter's 
missile-related environmental programme, which has been 
thoroughly worked out. 
  The United States programme's starting theses are 
significantly different from the Russian ones. For example, the 
flight trajectory of missiles and missile-launchers goes over 
the Pacific Ocean. However, the two countries' cooperation in 
this sphere is still very helpful. 
  "The programme which we have created is the first step to 
the 
development of an environmental monitoring system to keep track 
of the situation as it develops", stressed Colonel Omelchenko.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prof. Kirill Pavlovich Stayev, conducted by </F>
Mikhail Dmitruk: "The Poor Little Princess Bit the Poisoned 
Apple" 
  [Text] And why? Because the beauty in Pushkin's 
famous fairy tale had never had "ecological literacy" training. 
Incidentally, that subject, one pertaining to environmental 
protection, may soon be studied by Russia's school children and 
vocational students. 
  Adults keep on polluting the environment as if they had 
no children, and as if they themselves would live forever. 
Clearly the next generation will have to save itself. And adults 
are already prepared to give it that chance. Recently a joint 
board meeting of two Russian ministries -- education and 
environmental protection -- approved a draft resolution on 
recruitment of school children in ecological studies. Our 
science correspondent discussed this new and extremely important 
undertaking with Professor Kirill Pavlovich Stayev, State Prize 
laureate, who helped prepare the resolution. 
  Stayev: One of the main reasons for the 
thoughtless attitude toward nature is the lack of ecological 
culture in Russia. It needs to be taught in school, or else it 
will be too late. But ecology should not be a separate subject, 
but rather a leitmotiv for all disciplines, because the most 
important issue facing humanity today is the struggle for 
survival in a poisoned environment. 
  Dmitruk: Why frighten school children with the 
"environmental ulcers" that have been uncovered virtually 
everywhere in Russia? If they learn of these things at a tender 
age they might be psychologically traumatized, and children's 
health has been undermined by environmental pollution as it is. 
  Stayev: The mass media are no longer concealing 
the scale of environmental disaster in Russia -- and children 
are aware of it, too. But in the hunt for sensational material 
many journalists like to spend their time uncovering 
environmental crimes and talk very little about how to deal with 
their consequences. Most often children are psychologically 
traumatized because they do not know how they are going to 
survive in a poisoned environment. By teaching them that, we 
eliminate both destructive factors, both the psychological and 
the physical. 
  Dmitruk: Is that really possible in today's Russia? 
  Stayev: It is becoming possible. By a joint 
decision of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources and the Ministry of Education, ecology lessons are 
being introduced in secondary schools and vocational schools. 
These lessons are to be taught by instructors in biology, 
physics, chemistry and other subjects. Through practical 
exercises the children will learn about hazards to the 
environment so they will be aware of how to subsequently clean 
up various pollutants. 
  Dmitruk: But should that not be done by the 
adults who work for Ministry of Environmental Protection 
agencies and the public health service? 
  Stayev: Even school children know how well they 
are coping with their jobs. Those agencies are chronically short 
of people and money. Therefore even Russia's "environmental 
ulcers" -- places like Norilsk, Chelyabinsk, Plesetsk and many 
other "environmental disaster areas" -- have not been thoroughly 
studied, much less cleaned up. But things that underpowered 
organizations are not capable of doing can be accomplished by 
millions of Russian school children and vocational school 
students. 
  Dmitruk: That tremendous force can be utilized 
free of charge under the banner of struggle for survival. But 
lots of money will be needed for instruments, reagents and 
cleaning agents for laboratory studies. Where will that money 
come from? 
  Stayev: By decision of the two ministries it has 
been recommended that regional environmental organs and 
ecological funds allocate up to five percent of their total 
annual funding to support environmental education. 
  Dmitruk: Excuse me, but in Russia not even laws 
are always complied with, so mere recommendations from two 
impoverished ministries can simple be ignored if it is not 
advantageous to comply. What advantages can there be from 
environmental education? 
  Stayev: Very major ones, because environmental 
protection organs' funding is derived mainly from fines imposed 
on enterprises that pollute the environment. The more polluters 
the kids expose, the more fines professional defenders of nature 
will collect. The benefit will probably be several times greater 
than the five percent of funding that we recommend be allocated 
for environmental education. 
  Dmitruk: But if this idea takes off, the mafia 
structures that are now pocketing the money allocated by the 
state for environmental protection are not likely to be too 
happy about it. And might not the heads of enterprises that are 
violating environmental protection law, to put it mildly, drop 
students a "hint" that they should stop any studies that might 
bring on scandals and fines? 
  Stayev: Today there is nothing more important for 
the next generation than environmental protection. If young 
people do not protect the environment, soon irreversible 
processes in the biosphere capable of destroying every living 
thing could begin. There can be no compromise on this point: 
either we die out, or we save nature and ourselves. 
  We cannot sit idly by while every living thing dies. It is 
not possible to halt this extinction without heroism and 
self-sacrifice, and we must prepare young people for that. 
  Right now they are being taught to take really pointless 
risks. For example, Western movies are cultivating extreme 
individualism, depravity and cruelty -- that is about how to 
kill, not save. A majority of children and teenagers get no 
other training: the Pioneer organization is gone for good, and 
the Boy Scout movement is in its infancy. Kids cannot find a 
larger positive cause to unite them. The struggle to save their 
Fatherland from ecological disaster could be that cause. That 
struggle would fill teenagers' lives with profound meaning, a 
spirit of collectivism and noble romanticism. 
  Dmitruk: It is not likely that pretty words will 
inspire today's teenagers to undertake selfless labor, even for 
the sake of saving everyone, because in recent years they have 
been taught to seek instant material gratification in all things. 
  Stayev: And that is what we are offering kids. 
Through ecology lessons they would find out about the extent of 
pollution and method of decontaminating the food products they 
buy in stores with their parents, buy at markets or grow in 
their own garden plots. They would test sites to determine soil 
acidity, water hardness and background radiation, and then bring 
them down to normal levels. The knowledge and skills learned by 
students could be passed on to their parents and to their 
grandparents. The older generation should have a keen interest 
in their kids getting environmental training. 
  I am referring not only to parents, but also to the heads of 
enterprises. A majority of enterprises are going to be 
privatized, and a good manager is always interested in the 
health of his employees. 
  Dmitruk: In the West it has long been calculated 
like this: one dollar invested in environmental protection 
yields an eightfold profit. 
  Stayev: Yes, and therefore it will be very much to 
an enterprise manager's benefit to hire graduates who have 
environmental training: they will look out for their health and 
for the environment. Even now owners of enterprises should be 
interested in environmental training at the schools and 
vocational schools from which they get new personnel. A 
farsighted manager could sponsor that effort, with benefit for 
himself as well. 
  Enterprises used to become patrons of local educational 
institutions on orders from above. But prudent enterprise owners 
will voluntarily be patrons of economic [sic] education in 
general schools and vocational schools that will in the future 
yield for them greater savings in fines paid to environmental 
protection agencies and in sick days for their employees.

Democratic Green Party of Chelyabinsk Oblast: "I Want To Tell 
You About the Chelyabinsk Tragedy"] 
  [Text] Ukrainian People's Deputy Volodymyr 
Yavorivskyy quite recently received a letter which related the 
fate suffered by the hostages of the "Urals Chernobyl" -- the 
Mayak Industrial Combine. Volodymyr Oleksandrovych conveyed this 
letter to our newspaper, as its author had requested. We offer 
it here for your attention. 
  Dear fellow-countrymen! 
  I am writing to you from the distant Ural city of 
Chelyabinsk. I was born near Kherson, studied at Odessa 
University, worked for 11 years at the Odessa Polytechnical 
Institute, and I have been here for 26 years -- at the 
Chelyabinsk Technical University. 
  My older children and grandchildren are Ukrainians, whereas 
my younger daughter is Russian; I have brothers and sisters 
living in Kiev, Kherson, Odessa, and Moscow. Both Ukrainian and 
Russian cultures are near and dear to me. In my soul and in my 
consciousness Russians and Ukrainians are fraternal peoples. 
  I want to tell you about the Chelyabinsk tragedy so that you 
may know what is menacing you. 
  Some 45 years ago in this short-lived "Ural Switzerland" an 
enterprise began to be built for the purpose of making an atom 
bomb. The best minds of our nation were brought here, and they 
worked self-sacrificingly, believing in the need to create an 
atomic shield for our Fatherland. This plant was built in record 
time. 
  But the technology of radiation safety was still at a very 
low level at that time. Plutonium was carried about in glass 
vessels, adulterated radioactive wastes were poured into the 
small Techa River, on the bank of which the "Mayak" Chemical 
Combine was situated. That came to be the name of the production 
association which produced nuclear weapons. 
  Thousands of nuclear specialists and service personnel 
perished during the first few years of Mayak's operation, and 
nobody has ever counted the number of people living around there 
who also were lost. 
  Finally the authorities came to their senses and began to 
resettle people away from the river. They fenced it about with 
barbed wire and prohibited people from drinking its water, 
bathing in it, or watering their cattle in it. But for many 
years they did not explain to people the reason for these 
prohibitions. And people used to drink contaminated milk, eat 
vegetables from cities which used water from the Techa for 
irrigation purposes, and they continued to bathe in this river. 
  The average life expectancy declined to 40 years. And these 
could not really be called lives. Everone's bones hurt, they had 
headaches, they were weak, and suffered from bleeding. And in 
the town of Ozersk (Chelyabinsk-65) more and more children came 
into the world with birth defects. Whereas in 1955 these 
amounted to 10-11 per 1000 births, in 1988 this indicator stood 
at 22 per 1000 births. 
  Another misfortune was that the medical personnel were 
forbidden to make correct diagnoses. This was a state secret. 
The physicians had to sign an agreement not to divulge their 
diagnoses. How many tragedies could have been averted if it had 
not been for this anti-humane decree or regulation! 
  In 1957 there was an explosion at a tank in which diluted 
radioactive wastes (RAO) were being stored for safekeeping. As a 
result of this rupture, a trail 105 km long and 8-10 km in width 
was created. The fate of the persons who happened to be on the 
territory of this radioactive trail was tragic. Without any 
explanations of the reasons for this, all such persons were 
herded into barracks; their clothing and personal effects were 
burned, and they were given different clothing. A ditch was dug, 
and bulldozers were used to dump everything in it together with 
the cattle and bury the whole lot. The people were hauled away 
and resettled in temporary buildings. And then they were 
forgotten. 
  The third significant accident at the Mayak Chemical Combine 
occurred in 1967. After the toxification of the Techa people 
began pouring RAO into man-made or natural lakes. In one such 
lake, in Karachay, RAO accumulated having an activity factor of 
600 million Curie units (12 times greater than the amount 
emitted at the time of the Chernobyl disaster). 
  The summer of 1967 was a scorcher. The Karachay grew very 
shallow; the banks became denuded; the radioactive algae and mud 
dried up and turned into dust. The wind raised this lethal dust 
and and carried out about over an area inhabited by close to a 
half a million people. 
  Small or modest-sized accidents which occur -- in the 
specialists' words -- within the "regulated system" (that is, 
with discharges less than the allowable parameters) happen all 
the time and with great frequency. Thus, for example, on 17 July 
of last year there occurred a discharge at one subdivision of 
the Mayak Chemical Combine; and a slurry pipeline burst on 4 
August. 
  The authorities reassure us that such discharges are less 
than the parameters of the allowable norms, but we doubt that 
the grounds justifying these norms are adequate. Furthermore, 
their frequency is so great that the sum-total turns out to be 
significant. 
  The swamps and ground waters of our oblast contain a total 
RAO having an activity of 1 billion, 300 million Curie units 
(equivalent to approximately 26 Chernobyls). There are 935 
persons here who are ill with radiation sickness. Our hematology 
units at the local treatment facility are completely filled with 
sick children; 80 percent of them will die, and their places 
will be taken by others. 
  The nuclear shield of the Fatherland not only protects but 
also kills people. The military-industrial complex throughout 
the world is guided solely by its own departmental interests, as 
well as by the desire to preserve and safeguard its own 
scientific potential, its own privileged position, the existence 
of "closed" cities, and so forth. But these interests do not 
coincide with those of people in general. 
  We consider that nuclear production -- including nuclear 
electric-power engineering -- is leading us to destruction. We 
must re-orient ourselves as rapidly as possible to alternative 
energy sources. For gigantomania will utterly ruin us.

<F P=106> [Report by SIM: "Russian Troops Left Their Bases and </F>
Radiation" -- first paragraph published in boldface] 
  [Text] The ecological problems of disarmament will be 
discussed at a planned seminar at Narach lake under the auspices 
of the Belarusian Defense Ministry, the State Committee for 
Ecology, and the Belarusian Academy of Sciences. 
  An area of more than 4.5 million hectares has been vacated 
after the withdrawal of certain units of the Russian Strategic 
Missile Forces. Use of this land, however, has been complicated 
by the fact that increased radiation has been observed at 
numerous sites. For example, in Marina Horka -- one of the 
Russian units' bases -- the level of radiation exceeds the norm 
by 10 times. There have been reports that radioactive emitters, 
which were used for didactical purposes, were stored here. The 
lack of controls and natural aging of the emitters have led to 
the increased radiation levels. At Rechytsa, a radioactive 
waste dump which has been handed over to the Belarusian Interior 
Ministry, radiation is detectable within 200 meters of the 
perimeter. Since the dumping ground is located in an 
unprotected forest area, the local citizens -- unaware of any 
danger -- are taking advantage of nature's bounty there.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "'International Safety Regulations </F>
Are Not Met,' IAEA Experts Said"] 
  [Text] According to an agreement with COMPETENT Ukrainian 
agencies, a group of experts for the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] worked for two weeks at the Chernobyl nuclear 
power plant. Certain well-informed sources, preferring to 
remain anonymous, sent our newspaper the text of a letter by 
IAEA Director Hans Blix to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
summarizing the results of the work done by the experts of his 
organization. We have the opportunity to acquaint our readers 
with almost the full text of this letter that is of great 
interest. Here it is (the original style is preserved): 
  "...documented were numerous shortcomings in ensuring safety 
at the operational nuclear units. Particular concern is aroused 
by specific problems connected with the obsolete design of the 
old-type No. 1 reactor that are still waiting to be resolved... 
  "Experts have also pointed to a number of factors that, when 
combined, effect the overall safety situation. Difficult work 
conditions and a substantial steady drain of qualified 
professionals represent a big problem. In addition, a limited 
possibility to purchase common equipment results in a deficiency 
of necessary spare parts. 
  "The most serious problem established by the experts is the 
accelerated deterioration of the `Shelter' at the No. 4 reactor 
unit. The destruction of this unit, if it were to take place, 
would complicate safety conditions of operational units and 
produce grave ecological consequences. 
  "Although fully aware of the magnitude of the economic 
crisis 
that Ukraine confronts, I consider it my duty to bring to your 
attention that international safety norms are currently not met 
in Chernobyl. Given the graveness of the present situation, you 
might want to convene a meeting with the concerned countries to 
discuss what measures could be taken to improve the situation..."

<F P=106> [Article by Bohdan Bereketa, HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent: </F>
"...All Traces Have Been Buried in the Bunker"] 
  [Text] An extraordinary event took place in Lutsk. It was 
only recently that local authorities found out that, since 
September 1993, unspecified chemical substances have been lying 
about on the territory of the city (a few meters away from the 
Styr River). They had been brought in by the Polish firm 
"Midas." There are more than 10 tonnes of them in 194 barrels. 
The cargo had been sent to the local scientific and production 
society "Industriya-T Ltd." The cargo arrived without a proper 
contract, specifications, or certificate. 
  "To this day, nobody knows through which Customs post these 
chemical substances got to Volyn Oblast," oblast chief of the 
State Administration for Environmental Protection Rostyslav 
Mihas said indignantly. "One has an impression that they have 
fallen from the sky. Even a commodity-transportation invoice is 
missing." 
  Very much about it is a mystery. General director of the 
"Industriya-T Ltd" Yevhen Lebed maintains that he has no 
business relations with the Polish firm "Midas." 
  "We have a contract with the `Doris' firm in Wlodawa," said 
Yevhen Oleksandrovych. "The Poles owe us a few thousand U.S. 
dollars. We agreed by telephone that, for these dollars, they 
would send us dyes and varnishes.... As for the firm "Midas," I 
don't know anything." 
  I would like to believe that this is the case. However, the 
"commodity" had been stored for one-half year on the 
"Industriya-T Ltd" premises. Without corresponding documents. 
It is still unknown what substances are within the barrels. 
Much later, some unofficial papers in German arrived from 
Poland. If one is to believe the text, the barrels contain 
dangerous substances, which decompose upon contact with water, 
acid, or carbon dioxide and may produce toxic hydrocyanic acid. 
According to R. Mihas, there is a suspicion that this cargo 
arrived from another country, but via Poland. 
  When local authorities found out what kind of "commodity" it 
was, they decided to immediately take it away from the city. 
The Civil Defense headquarters, the Sanitary Service, and the 
militia offered their help, and the Procurator's Office started 
looking into the case.... The chemical substances were 
transported to the territory of a former military unit and 
buried in the bunker of the former command post. Again a 
violation. The military property had been transferred to the 
collective agricultural enterprise "Ukrayina" in Kivertsi Rayon. 
However, not only wasn't the farm's leadership asked 
permission, but it was not even notified [about the chemicals]. 
Of course, the local residents are upset, as some of them work 
there. 
  Deputy chairman of the Volyn state administration Andriy 
Chumachenko said that a letter had been sent to corresponding 
Polish services with a request to locate the owner of the 
unknown chemicals. The answer was as follows: "`Pan [Mr.] 
manager' is under `criminal' investigation." 
  Does the "Midas" firm exist at all? 
  This is how we live. It has already been some time since 
waste products in the guise of raw materials have been delivered 
from Germany to the Lutsk plastic wares plant. Take what we 
don't need. This is done without any authorization on the part 
of environmental protection bodies. The enterprise cannot 
reprocess this garbage, yet it continues to arrive. Almost 130 
tonnes of German waste products are buried on the territory of 
the plant. Another 40 tonnes are still lying about....Volyn 
Oblast. 
<H5>  Editorial Note </H5>
  On 28 March 1994, with a mutual agreement by representatives 
of more than 100 countries that are signatories to the Basel 
Convention, a total ban was adopted on exporting dangerous waste 
products (including exports of waste products for reprocessing) 
from developed countries to developing ones and to countries of 
Eastern Europe and the CIS. 
  Today, 98 percent of waste products of various industries 
accumulate precisely in 24 most advanced countries of the world 
-- from now on they will have to deal with that junk on their 
own. 
  It is true, though, that Ukraine has not yet joined the 
Basel 
Convention. That is why it is being used as a dumping ground.

<F P=106> [Article by Mykhaylo Kuzmenko, head of the Department of </F>
Radioecology at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences 
Hydrobiological Institute: "How Do You Feel, Dnieper?] 
  [Text] The fate of the Dnieper River is in the fate of 
Ukraine. The fate of Ukraine is in the fate of the Dnieper 
River. From times immemorial, the Dnieper has been a source of 
livelihood, a defender, and a savior for the people who lived in 
its valley. Its banks became a cradle for the Ukrainian nation 
and for the first human cereal-growing civilization -- the 
Trypillya culture. The genius of Ukraine's great son T.G. 
Shevchenko matured and derived inspiration on the banks of the 
Dnieper. The immortal bard found his last refuge there, too.... 
  For the majority of Ukraine's population -- 35 million 
persons -- the Dnieper continues to be the indispensable source 
of drinking water; it satisfies the needs of industry and 
irrigated agriculture; it is also used as an economic transport 
line. Not to mention the Dnieper's significance for the 
spiritual world of the people as a source for literary and 
artistic creativity! 
  Throughout its age-old history, the Slavutych [a poetic name 
for the Dnieper] repeatedly suffered enfeebling droughts and 
destructive floods. However, recent decades have become 
particularly ominous for the great river. The epoch of 
hydrological construction culminated in the creation of six 
water reservoirs: Kiev, Kaniv, Kremenchuk, Dniprodzerzhynsk, 
Zaporizhzhya, and Kakhovka. The semi-flowing water reservoirs, 
created in the flat- country river, have lost their eternal 
purity and the life-giving properties of the Dnieper water. The 
yearly mass development of blue-green algae -- the algal bloom, 
the formation of slime, the swamping of huge shallow-water 
areas, the chemical pollution, and, as a result, the sharp 
deterioration of the biological quality of the water -- this is 
a very incomplete list of afflictions suffered by Ukraine's 
life-giving artery. 
  Great changes have taken place in the qualitative 
composition 
of the ichthyofauna; valuable species of fish -- sturgeon, pike, 
and carp -- have disappeared or decreased in number, whereas 
fish of inferior value, such as clupeids, gudgeon, or rudd, have 
multiplied. 
  However, the Chernobyl nuclear tornado has introduced the 
most dreadful poison into the Dnieper. As a result of the 
accident, the natural ecosystems in the Dnieper Basin have also 
undergone wide- scale radioactive contamination. On the first 
days after the catastrophe, fragments of uranium fissure were 
driven by the wind in various directions and over huge distances 
away from the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant, 
contaminating woods, fields, water reservoirs and becoming 
deposited in plant and animal organisms. 
  Prior to the accident, the background content of 
radionuclides in the water of the Kiev Reservoir was as follows: 
strontium-90, between 0.00407 and 0.00682 becquerels per liter; 
cesium-137, between 0.00074 and 0.0037 becquerels per liter. 
The radioecological situation in the Dnieper and in its 
reservoirs largely took shape during the first weeks and months 
following the accident, when the content of radionuclides in the 
water reached between 0.04 and 1,332 becquerels per liter and up 
to 800,000 becquerels per kilogram of natural moisture content 
in bottom deposits. 
  Among the main tasks during the period that has passed after 
the accident there was work associated with the protection of 
water bodies, in particular, the building of dams and traps on 
the path of the main flows of radionuclides and the fixation of 
soil in the areas of drainage. Despite the considerable 
expenditure and the large volume of work aimed at reducing the 
travel of radionuclides from the 30-kilometer zone, the escape 
of radionuclides to the Prypyat River, the Dnieper River, and 
its reservoirs could not be appreciably reduced. 
  For example, at the end of 1993, the content of 
radionuclides 
in the Kiev Water Reservoir was as follows: in bottom 
sediments, 26 becquerels per kilogram strontium-90 and 815 
becquerels per kilogram cesium-137; in plants, respectively, 102 
and 407; in mollusks, 138 and 195; and in fishes, 13 and 211. At 
the present stage, the radioecological situation in the Dnieper 
and its reservoirs remains unstable. The content of 
radionuclides in the water is between 10 and 20 and in aqueous 
organisms 30 to 1,500 times that prior to the accident. Some 
carnivorous fishes in the Kiev Reservoir were found to contain 
cesium-137 in quantities that were one and one-half times the 
permissible level established in 1993 by the National Commission 
for Radiation Protection.

<F P=106> [Natalya Filipchuk report: "The Road Has Been Chosen. How </F>
To Cover It?" -- first paragraph published in boldface] 
  [Text] On 7 and 8 April, the conference "The Road Toward a 
Nonnuclear Future; Ecological Problems of Ukraine's Nonnuclear 
Status and Human Psychology" was held in Kiev in the Ukrainian 
Building for Economic and Scientific and Technological Knowledge. 
  The conference was largely sponsored by the Global and 
Regional Security Institute. The Ministry of Defense and the 
Ministry of Machine Building, Military-Industrial Complex, and 
Conversion organized it. Vice prime minister Valeriy Shmarov, 
who opened the conference, made the following comment upon the 
fact: "The Ministry of Defense is interested in new scientific 
developments as a consumer. The Ministry of Machine Building -- 
as a contractor...." Regarding scientists, they also tried to 
specify their role in the future nuclear conversion and asked 
how long the information (partially published in the foreign 
press) that is essential for their elaborations, will be 
withheld from them. To this Shmarov replied: Foreign 
journalists know how to work and they always obtain the 
necessary information. 
  However, this strictly practical question sounded very 
routine against the background of the issues that were discussed 
at the esteemed academic gathering. Namely: political and 
legal aspects of nuclear disarmament; the development of 
programs for destroying nuclear missile weapons and ecological 
and economic problems of their implementation; how to prevent 
the spread of radiation through subsurface water; the safety of 
the population residing near potentially hazardous facilities; 
the psychological syndrome that may afflict the liquidators of 
the accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant in the 
future; social guarantees for servicemen from those military 
formations that will be disbanded. With regard to the latter, 
vice premier Shmarov said this: Seventy-five percent of all the 
capital allocated for the disarmament program (according to some 
tentative estimates, it is $2.5 billion -- N. F.), will, in all 
probability, be spent on the social protection of servicemen 
dismissed from military service, on finding new working places 
for unique specialists, and on reprofiling. Incidentally, on 
this particular issue, no common language was found with the 
U.S. side. 
  A considerable sum is also allocated for ensuring ecological 
aspects of nuclear disarmament. In the opinion of the majority 
of speakers, Ukraine must abandon the idea of accumulating 
nuclear waste on its territory and utilizing (which is extremely 
expensive) the radioactive fuel in the hope to later emerge onto 
the international market with newly produced uranium, something 
upon which some specialists insist. All the more so since this 
will be difficult to accomplish in the near future. In the next 
15 years, Russia will supply uranium to the United States (500 
tonnes, in accordance with an agreement). The conference, which 
was prepared at the highest level and at which interesting and, 
the main thing, realistic reports were delivered, proved that 
Ukraine has a chance to cover that road toward a nonnuclear 
future, but there will be many problems and shocks on that road.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on a briefing held by the chairman of </F>
Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Energy, Mykhaylo Umanets; 
place and date not given: "The Moratorium on Nuclear Power 
Stations Is a Headache for the State" -- first paragraph 
published in boldface] 
  [Text] In winter, the entire population felt the shortage 
of energy. That we did not freeze to death is largely thanks to 
the concerted work of the AES [nuclear power station] 
collectives. In those months, they accounted for 40 percent of 
the total electricity produced in Ukraine. All together over 
the last year, AES's produced 75,238 million kilowatt/hours, or 
33 percent of the total amount of electricity. Moreover, it 
costs half of that produced by conventional power stations. 
These figures were made public at a briefing held by the 
chairman of Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Energy, 
Mykhaylo Umanets.

  "We are pleased with the result," said Mykhaylo Umanets. "We 
have not let the country down, and this is what matters. Are we 
satisfied with the quality of our work? Safe operation is our 
quality. Accidents were prevented from happening. It is true 
that there were 11 incidents, but, in accordance with the 
international scale of nuclear and radiation safety, they were 
rated as incidents of first and second degrees, which do not 
have in any unexpected consequences." 
  Mykhaylo Panteliyovych also regards the cancellation of the 
moratorium on the building of new power units, something that 
has undoubtedly opened up prospects to the industry, as a 
victory of common sense over political intrigue. A decision was 
also made to postpone the closure of the Chernobyl station. 
This will make it possible to prepare more thoroughly for its 
closure and, at the same time, have economic advantages. The 
station will continue to produce the electricity that we need so 
much for a few more years. 
  What all of this has cost us! Quite recently, the press 
brought to the public's attention the desperate "SOS" by the 
nuclear industry, which, while selling the cheapest electricity 
to the state, did not have money to purchase fuel because of 
customers' failure to pay for the energy; it also sounded the 
alarm that specialists are leaving Ukraine's AES's en masse. 
The reason is the lack of social protection and salaries, which 
are lower than those in Russia. 
  It appears that this alarm was heard. At any rate, the 
president issued an decree enabling nuclear specialists to 
resolve many of the burning problems by exporting some of the 
electricity. The fuel issue has also been taken off the agenda 
for several years. The stations will receive the fuel from 
Russia in exchange for nuclear warheads from strategic missiles. 
  Considerable changes for the better have also been achieved 
in raising the level of the stations' operational safety. Over 
recent years, hundreds of specialists have received training at 
nuclear stations in Western countries. Recently a simulator 
started working at the Zaporizhzhya AES, and operators of VVR 
[water-water)-1,000 nuclear reactors will improve their 
qualifications with its help. The installation of a simulator 
presented to us by France will soon be completed at the 
Khmelnytskyy AES. 
  Last year, for the first time, the Sevastopol Naval 
Institute 
admitted two groups of students to specialize in servicing 
AES's. The majority of the students are residents of towns with 
developed power engineering. 
  The price we have had to pay for the moratorium will long 
remain a pain. Incidentally, it has not yet been determined 
numerically in terms of money. However, it is known that, owing 
to those politicians who rose high in their careers on 
anti-nuclear wings, we have lost 4 billion pre-inflation rubles. 
It is precisely such funding that Ukraine did not receive from 
the Union budget, after it stopped work building units that were 
at a high level of readiness. 
  This moratorium has now been canceled. Some people have 
received political dividends from this and the state -- a 
headache: Where, in our budget made up of holes, can we get 
such astronomical sums? The sixth unit of the Zaporizhzhya AES 
has to be commissioned this year. The second unit of the 
Khmelnytskyy and the fourth of the Rivne stations must be 
commissioned in 1996. 
  Nor will it be simple to fulfill this program in view of the 
fact that the construction and assembly collectives have, in 
fact, deserted the stations. Only superb specialists can and 
have the right to build such facilities. However, not even 
these problems are a matter of the greatest concern for 
departmental heads. Given our political situation, the lack of 
clarity is quite disturbing. Where are the guarantees that the 
new parliament will not pass a law on a new moratorium? 
Decisions to open or close the Chernobyl AES have been made 
five times. 
Despite everything, specialists are already looking to the 
future: the construction of new-generation fast-neutron power 
units, which are more economical and more reliable. Canadian, 
U.S., French, and Japanese specialists are offering their 
designs. 
  We have our own scientifically substantiated concept on 
developing the industry under the headline of creating our own 
nuclear cycle in Ukraine. Of course, it is an expensive 
undertaking. However, it is worth the huge outlays, because not 
only is it economically advantageous, but also politically 
expedient, pointed out Mykhaylo Umanets. 
  "At present, fuel accounts for 64 percent of the cost of the 
electricity produced by the nuclear stations," he reasoned. 
"Calculations have shown that this percentage could be halved, 
if we did not have to purchase that fuel abroad, considering 
that Ukraine is already capable of extracting and enriching 
uranium ore to a concentration of natural uranium. We send this 
ore to Russian enterprises where the fuel elements are 
manufactured. We also send zirconium there, from which the 
holders for the cassettes are made. Incidentally, Ukraine used 
to have a monopoly on the extraction and production of zirconium 
within the USSR. Since we possess it and have specialists at 
the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences who may ensure the scientific 
implementation of the project, we simply have no moral right not 
to use such a potential in the interests of our own state. 
These outlays will eventually be returned a hundredfold. 
Ukraine could lose its independence if it continues to receive 
energy from neighboring states, which often use it to put 
pressure on us.

<F P=106> [Article by O. Kharlamenko, head of the Mariopol PZU (Green </F>
Party of Ukraine) Club, and L. Olshevskyy, member of the ZELENYY 
SVIT UEA (Ukrainian Ecodefencinform Agency): "Why Are There So 
Few Happy Families in Mariopol?"] 
  [Text] During the first quarter of last year 800 marriages 
were registered in Mariopol, whereas 764 divorces were 
registered during this same period. According to data from a 
sociological poll conducted by a civic organization here, the 
principal reason for such "family" instability is the 
infertility and impotence of this city's human population. These 
factors have reached 60 percent and 33 percent respectively. 
  However, even if a family in Mariopol has a "real man," that 
does not necessarily mean that such a family will add a third or 
fourth member. The rate of stillbirths and infant mortality 
before the age of one year during the period 1989-1991 varied 
between 45 percent and 50 percent. Thanks to modern-day 
medicine, this indicator declined to 26 percent in 1992. But 
this was specifically due to ultrasonic diagnostics and the 
interruption of pregnancy in cases where anomalies were 
discovered. And this was already after nature itself had made a 
choice: From 1989 through 1992 the number of miscarriages 
increased from 24 to 32 per 100 pregnancies. 
  Nor can those families in which an infant has arrived always 
be called happy. Of each 1000 children, 22 are born with birth 
defects (for the sake of comparison, in Simferopol this 
indicator stands at 8). 
  At a time when the birth rate is declining, the mortality 
rate is rising: During the first quarter of 1993 it increased by 
25 percent in comparison with this same period in 1992. But what 
do births and deaths have in common? The connecting link here is 
a cancer-treatment facility which was built for 90 beds but 
which now has 220. 
  This situation is dreadful, but it can be explained. This 
city with its 540,000 inhabitants provides 35 percent of 
Ukraine's steel and 30 percent of Ukraine's sheet metal. 
Mariopol also produces 90 percent of all kinds of septic tanks, 
as well as equipment for metallurgical and ore-enriching 
complexes. It carries out contracts for the Ministry of Medium 
Machine Building, and -- in addition -- has a plant producing 
medical equipment, as well as very large construction 
enterprises. The Mariopol seaport is the biggest on the shores 
of the Sea of Azov. Its annual goods turnover amounts to 12 
million tonnes. Plying the world's oceans are at least 100 ships 
of the Azov Shipping Company, which are registered in the Port 
of Mariopol. 
  And all these entities are gasping and spewing out terrible 
poisons. Two steel-smelting plants and one coal-tar chemical 
plant have become particularly old and obsolete. This complex, 
which still bears the name of Illich, is regarded as the most 
modern and up-to-date in Ukraine. Among its production 
facilities, which extend around the city's outskirts, is an 
open-hearth shop with three furnaces having a capacity of 900 
tonnes each and three others having a capacity of 650 tonnes 
each. It has these furnaces, but they lack any equipment for 
combatting the contaminants from them. During the last 30 years 
unsafe wastes discharged by these plants have accumulated in 
enormous quantities in bodies of water which are unsuitable for 
this purpose. Solid wastes alone, which include 75 percent iron 
compounds, 1 percent manganese compounds, and 1.2 percent zinc 
compounds, have accumulated to the extent of more than a million 
tonnes. People say that during the Soviet Union period the 
Japanese wanted to acquire all of these materials wholesale, but 
the Soviet government refused -- saying that not a single gram 
of strategic raw material should be turned over to a potential 
enemy. And the adulterated wastes have been abandoned at two 
dump sites, from which sufuric acid has already been leaking for 
many years now. 
  That which the people of Mariopol drink can hardly be termed 
"water." The small Northern Donets River, which constitutes the 
principal source of water here, is dreadfully polluted, and the 
purification station is not operating in accordance with the 
normative requirements. Its operators have been compelled to add 
more chlorine than provided for by the norms, but that still 
does not help the situation much because waste waters are 
seeping into the system. 
  At one time Mariopol was a health-resort area. But nowadays 
the beaches are closed down every year. Salmonela bacteria have 
been found near the waste-water discharge collectors on the 
beaches, and cholera bacteria have been found in the Kalchyk 
Stream, which winds its way through the city. 
  It is not an easy matter to track down all these bad things, 
all the more so in that there are only five inspectors on the 
staff of the Ministry for Environmental Protection's local 
administration. Efforts to reinforce them should not be impeded. 
It would also be a good idea to outfit them with up-to-date 
monitoring equipment. Only when a correct diagnosis has been 
made and effective monitoring controls set up will we be able to 
actually proceed to carry out plans providing for the 
development of alternative industrial sectors, the optimization 
and modernization of metallurgical enterprises, as well as 
putting new purification capacities into operation.
