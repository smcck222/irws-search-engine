<F P=106> [Article by Davit Bitsadze: "A Poverty-Stricken Country and </F>
Looted Banks"] 
  [Text] The public at large knows the story of the 
erroneous monetary-credit policy that began during the late 
unlamented rule of the ex-president and still triumphantly 
continues. The final, decisive battle against this destructive 
phenomenon of our economy has been declared by the republic's 
Procuracy, the Chamber of Control, and the Internal Affairs and 
Security ministries. They have shed light on numerous alarming 
facts, which we present to readers today and will continue to in 
the future. Let everyone know who is involved in these filthy 
and destructive affairs that threaten to lay waste to the 
country. 
  The criminal threesome took shape all of a sudden. It 
included D. Kinkladze, the chairman of Gori's Diadema 
Cooperative, E. Sulashvili, the head accountant of Tbilisi's 
Bagebi-92 Firm, and B. Leviashvili, a Gori resident of unknown 
occupation. In October-December 1992, they used false credit 
advices, tax orders, and expired limited checks to deposit 101 
million rubles illegally in the account of a small business 
called Rkina-Betoni in the Gardabani Branch of Binsotsbank. 
However, they failed to steal the money, the crime was detected 
and the money was sequestered. 
  The threesome's fantasy was even grander; they decided to 
create a commercial bank and obtained the support of National 
Bank President D. Dvalishvili and Georgian Rescue Corps Deputy 
Chairman G. Arveladze. Although the Argobank (that's what they 
decided to call it) did not have the money required by the 
capital fund or the necessary facilities, the former 
[Dvalishvili] readily registered it, and on the basis of a 
letter from Arveladze he granted it a billion rubles in credit 
for half a year, because it was supposedly part of the Rescue 
Corps. Of course, everything went according to the scenario: 
Argobank deposited funds in various companies and cooperatives; 
in return it obtained U.S. dollars and divvied them up. For 
their crime, Kinkladze and Sulashvili are in jail; Leviashvili 
fled to Moscow and is being sought. 
  In the same spirit of the times, Irakli Shavliashvili, the 
general director of Trialeti Cooperative in Tbilisi, assumed the 
mantle of someone concerned about his country and sent a 
touching letter to the government in 1992: "Lend me two billion 
rubles after I deliver a ship full of sugar to Batumi Harbor." 
Attached to the letter was former Vice Premier P. Koguashvili's 
resolution directing the appropriate officials to issue a letter 
guaranteeing the loan. The boastful and hypocritical 
Shavliashvili, armed with the letter, actually obtained the Head 
of Government's resolution as well, ordering National Bank 
President Demur Dvalishvili to speed up the documentation and 
thus speed up the transaction. As always, Demur Dvalishvili did 
just what he was told. National Bank Vice President N. Pipia was 
also hasty, failing to realize that the credit was supposed to 
be issued after the sugar was delivered to Batumi, and he 
directed Industria-Bank Board Chairman Z. Gendzekhadze to issue 
a two-billion ruble loan to Trialeti. Shavliashvili was lying in 
wait, and on that same day he transferred 1.98 billion rubles to 
Moscow, where it was converted, and 4,541,863 U.S. dollars wound 
up in the Warsaw Branch of Amerbank. To this day no one knows 
what happened to the money and whether there is any real chance 
for the state to get it back. 
  Shavliashvili was restless, and like a spider he spun new 
webs of deceitful manipulation. He signed agreements with 
Tbilisi firms such as Guri, Medasi, Lasha, and Bani and Company, 
such that these companies deposited 2.618 billion rubles in 
Trialeti. Naturally, these firms had obtained the money through 
state credits. In all the cases, the loans were issued for the 
purpose of bringing food into the republic. One bitter economist 
had this to say: "If food had really been brought in with the 
money which Georgia's banks loaned out, we would have enough for 
several years." People who have looked into it also say that the 
job shouldn't have been turned over to private persons, that the 
state ought to have a monopoly on it. Many also say that state 
banks ought not to grant loans to companies and cooperatives; 
that should be the commercial banks' job. It's certainly 
something to think about. Keep in mind also that bankers are 
profiting from it and have got rich. 
  Readers probably want to know what happened to I. 
Shavliashvili. Irakli Shavliashvili and his associates, 
presidents Zaal Godadze and Akaki Berdzenishvili of Medasi and 
Petra, skipped the country after getting their hands on 
billions, and are now in hiding. The Security Ministry has been 
asked to help find their whereabouts. 
  For years, money has been drained out of the National Bank 
by 
using a shabby, primitive trick--supposedly to bring food into 
the country. Because nothing was done to see that the money was 
spent as intended, sharpsters had a clear field and could easily 
turn credit into hard currency. In this way, a few people are 
getting rich while thousands and hundreds of thousands are 
getting poor. I. Iashvili, the President of Ika, is among those 
newly enriched. The National Bank granted 500 million coupons in 
his name. He, in turn, deposited the money in a firm called 
002/1, from which he was supposed to receive food and industrial 
goods. In fact, however, he got what he was trying for--U.S. 
dollars. 
  A. Adeishvili, chief of the Saketerzetmshenproekt 
Administration, also got in on the currency boom. He asked T. 
Sigua, the former chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers, and R. 
Gotsiridze, the former Vice Premier, for a loan of 1.2 billion 
rubles. His request did not use the notorious phrase "to acquire 
food"; he used a more original trick--the idea of bringing in 
fuel--and he promised to "help the citizens who had been cheated 
by the Imedi Firm." That is how he hooked the gullible. The 
President of the National Bank readily complied with R. 
Gotsiridze's resolution and authorized the state's commercial 
Agromretsvbank to issue the requested amount of the loan to the 
Administration. Adeishvili pulled another clever trick. He 
really did pay 88 million rubles to the citizens who had been 
cheated but used the rest of the money for his personal 
purposes; an investigation is underway. 
  There have been some particularly alarming cases of fraud 
owing to the National Bank's encouragement. The president of its 
creative firm Saburtalo-93 is G. Lomidze, who ought to earn a 
place in the Guinness Book of World Records for it. 
  To be more specific, G. Lomidze wrote an authorization and 
from the National Bank's Clearing Center he took 10 million 
coupons' worth of transfer documents to the Borzhomi Branch of 
Binsotsbank, in which he had opened an account. He put an 8 in 
front of the 10 million coupons to yield the enormous sum of 810 
million coupons. The Borzhomi doughheads "failed to notice" the 
inserted number (in such documents, you know, the amount is also 
written in words) and gave him the whole amount. By a prior 
arrangement, the swindler transferred 800 million to the account 
of the Forvard Brokerage Firm on the Caucasian Stock Exchange. 
The purpose this time, again, was a "noble" one--to bring food 
in for hungry people, although that was the furthest thing from 
the so-called president's mind. The greedy and vengeful G. 
Lomidze pocketed 11,300 dollars. In turn, Forvard set up its 
next lightning swindle: along with three other brokerage firms 
on the Caucasian Exchange it carried out another 
800-million-ruble commodityless transaction, causing a 
considerable loss to the state. 
  But that wasn't the end of G. Lomidze's fraudulent odyssey. 
This time, he got his hands on documents transferring 19 million 
coupons to various organizations. Using the same old method, he 
put a 7 in front of that number. Again, the personnel of 
Borzhomi's Agrobank were gullible enough to give him 719 million 
coupons. At Lomidze's request, 700 million coupons were 
deposited in the account of a company called Sameba--naturally, 
for the purpose of buying food. Then, as a result of an 
unauthorized deal between that firm and Saburtalo-93, he 
pocketed 10,000 dollars, but distributed 19 million coupons to 
three firms for the intended purpose. In this way, Lomidze 
easily got his hands on 1.5 billion coupons. 
  A comment: It has been determined that the blank passport 
with which G. Lomidze acted had been stolen along with some 
others from the passport desk of Tbilisi Vakskiy Rayon's 
Internal Affairs Department, and criminal proceedings have been 
instituted. The firms mentioned above, moreover, were doing 
their financial dealings without being registered with the Tax 
Inspectorate. Nobody checked on their activities, which is why 
they were able to operate so successfully. 
  Now let's look at the "heroic deeds" of the firm called 
Andria, and its President V. Kavtelidze. It is located in 
Tbilisi's Vakskiy Rayon. This executive had no trouble getting 
things going, obtaining a 1.5-billion-ruble loan from Tbilisi's 
Samepo Bank. He was also motivated by "good 
intentions"--bringing food in for the hungry people. Kavtelidze 
distributed the funds this way: he transferred one-third to 
various firms in order to appropriate them later. In fact, he 
pocketed 37,500 dollars instead of buying food. He transferred 
the remaining billion to a company called Berika for "commercial 
purposes." In fact, he was merely slaking his lust and readily 
sacrificed his country and its people. 
  We could talk endlessly about the National Bank's 
anti-national policy. Other banks are guilty of the same, 
including rayon-level banks. The Shulaveri Woolen Mill obtained 
a loan of 2.75 billion coupons from Marneuli's Agrobank. The 
entire sum (supposedly to procure wool) was transferred to 
Tbilisi's Kristal-LKG Corporation, which in turn deposited it in 
the account of a firm called Kapital-Plus "to buy food with." A. 
Lysenko, the General Director of Kapital-Plus, added it to other 
monies and transferred more than 1.5 billion coupons to seven 
brokerage firms on the Caucasian Stock Exchange, again "to buy 
food." In fact, however, he obtained and pocketed 27,432 U.S. 
dollars. As a result of a commodityless transaction of about 
11,000 dollars, the Tatishvili Brothers' Mukhranis Veli Company 
issued it for "meat that was procured"; in fact, nobody procured 
a single kilogram of meat. 
  This is not the only commodityless transaction by the 
Tatishvilis, along with other crimes. G. Galidava, the president 
of the firm called Uta, and his bookkeeper K. Chachua, 
established contact with that criminal gang through G. Gogsadze, 
a broker on the Caucasian Stock Exchange. They deposited 380 
million out of 500 million coupons borrowed from the bank, 
supposedly to buy meat; instead, they acquired 7,500 U.S. 
dollars. Now the Tatishvilis' depredations are at an end; they 
are in custody. The same fate has befallen other criminals who 
were in league with them. 
  G. Dolidze, the President of the KG Benevolent Corporation 
in 
Telavi, has shown himself to be an outstanding swindler and 
money-grubber. Using false tax orders and limited checks, he 
managed to deposit over two billion rubles in the Telavi, 
Signakhi, and Lagodekhi branches of Agromretsvbank, which he 
then transferred to various firms and corporations supposedly to 
acquire wine-making materials, but the deal fell apart, he was 
caught in the act, his hopes were dashed, and he got no dollars. 
V. Bilikhodze, the chairman of the Universali Cooperative in 
Ozurgeti, used false limited checks to steal 450 million rubles 
from the bank in a short time. 
  Investigative agencies have also received information about 
the improper use of credit funds on a large scale by firms named 
Kvatakhevi, Gigi, Achiko and Company, and others. Other 
commercial outfits are also being investigated. 
  After learning these facts, readers can easily see why our 
country is in such a predicament and why the treasury is empty. 
Some questions: What motivated the National Bank and other banks 
when issuing credit? Were they obligated to monitor the proper 
spending of the credit funds? And does the republic have a 
mechanism to provide that monitoring? Finally, what role is 
assigned to the republic's government and Finance Ministry in 
this regard? These questions are all of concern to anybody who 
cares about the country's fate. The Shavliashvilis, the 
Tatishvilis, the Lomidzes, the Kinkladzes, the Adeishvilis, and 
all the greedy people who stand behind them are ruining the 
country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Customs Department Chairman Viktor </F>
Lordkipanidze by Rusudan Lordkipanidze: "The Battle Will Be 
Merciless. Georgia Has Its Own National Customs Service": place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] Georgia has had its own customs service for 
two years now, but we cannot say yet that everything is perfect 
and without flaw in it. Most of the public gives it very poor 
marks, and not only that, people think it is a money-grubbing 
organization, and not without reason, I think. This is also 
attested these days by free-wheeling "black business." Of 
course, what kind of performance can you expect when this vital 
national service has been reorganized almost four times in its 
two years of existence, and its officials and customs personnel 
have been replaced similarly. How could all of this not leave 
its mark on the service's formation? Judge for yourself: the 
Georgian Customs Administration of the USSR Customs Committee 
was abolished in February 1992 and the Georgian Customs 
Department was formed, after which the Department became part of 
the Finance Ministry, only to be removed from it soon after and 
become a separate Customs Committee. Last year, again, this 
Committee was abolished and the Customs Department was 
formed. 
  "It was all new to Georgia, and it had to be learned 
empirically, gropingly, following hunches, and sometimes local 
officials put their own pockets' interests first," said the 
current chairman of the Customs Department, Viktor 
Lordkipanidze, a member of Parliament from Ajaria. He was 
appointed to the post, quite unexpectedly to everyone, late last 
year. Not much time has gone by since then, but it has been long 
enough for this man to become adjusted to his new job and to 
think out and shape his own future operations program. So I 
talked to him and asked, "Can we say, at long last, that Georgia 
has its own national customs service?" 
  [Lordkipanidze] Georgia's state customs service, the 
Georgian 
Customs Department, with its own customs agencies, laws, rules, 
material-technical base, and cadres, does exist legally and in 
actuality. It has been recognized and accepted as a member by 
the World Association of Customs Organizations; it is a subject 
in our republic's bilateral agreements with other countries; and 
its chairman is a full member of the Council of Chiefs of 
Customs Services of the CIS and an equal member of the heads of 
customs services of other countries. 
  At a press conference not long ago, Batoni Giorgi Chanturia 
(who seems to have maintained his interest in Georgia's customs 
service) said that Georgia's entry into the "ruble zone" is 
"already underway, inasmuch as Georgia's customs service has 
already joined Russia's customs service structure." 
  If such a political somersault is valid, then we can just as 
well turn it around with a back flip and say, "Russia's entry 
into the coupon zone is already underway, inasmuch as Russia's 
customs service has already joined Georgia's customs service 
structure." 
  And so, if we stop juggling words and look into the thing, 
Georgia's customs service is a two-year-old child, just getting 
on its feet, still learning and developing, but nevertheless 
independent and on its own. 
  Most of these two years have been taken up by wars to 
preserve Georgia's territorial integrity, and customs officials 
also put on the uniform. And they fought and died, too. 
  Even between wars, unarmed customs officials have been 
repeatedly pelted by legal and illegal armed formations. 
  Through its own fault, the customs service--and sometimes 
with good reason--acquired the image of a money-grubbing 
organization. The control agencies didn't waste time: they 
quickly created customs control structures and set up detection 
headquarters in the customs office. 
  [Correspondent] Nobody likes constant control, but it is a 
fact that the customs service has not been all that spotless.... 
  [Lordkipanidze] People in every era and in every country 
have 
had no sympathy for tax gatherers and customs officials. It 
cannot be disputed, of course, that the people's wrath is well 
founded these days. You have to agree, however, that it's 
annoying when you have to suffer not only your own lash but 
someone else's whip. We customs officials have enough sins of 
our own; don't hang other people's on us. 
  What we need to know is that the customs inspector is 
empowered and obliged to follow customs control procedures (and 
he does) only with respect to persons crossing the border at 
customs checkpoints, in specially designated customs zones. 
  Customs checkpoints on land are being created only by 
agreement with neighboring countries, and on both sides of the 
border. 
  [Correspondent] How many border customs checkpoints are 
there 
in Georgia right now? 
  [Lordkipanidze] There are railroad checkpoints at Gardabani 
and Sadakhlo; 
  highway checkpoints at Kazbegi, Lagodekhi, Samtatskaro, 
Tsiteli Khidi [Red Bridge], Ninotsminda, Guguti, Sadakhlo, 
Akhkerpi, and Sarpi; 
  maritime checkpoints at Batumi and Poti harbors; 
  airport checkpoints in Tbilisi and Batumi Airports. 
  Hence, anybody else who comes up to you somewhere else, on 
the highway or at a crossroads, on a train, wearing a uniform or 
not, armed or not, with credentials or not, who passes himself 
off as a "customs officer" is nothing but a highway robber and a 
criminal. 
  [Correspondent] I don't suppose that means that Customs 
Department personnel are all free of sin.... 
  [Lordkipanidze] Of course not. When we carried out the Head 
of State's order "On Planned Measures To Stabilize the Situation 
In Lower Kartli," we abolished the Bolnisi Customs Office and 
fired all its 60 staffers and officials; in Marneuli we set up a 
new customs office. In the Poti Customs Office we fired the 
chief, and in Sadakhlo we fired the entire 36-man crew of the 
customs post, which both local and foreign citizens had been 
lodging complaints against. An investigation is underway, and so 
far 26 men have been fired. 
  [Correspondent] Naturally, you will hire new ones to replace 
them. Isn't it possible, though, that one robber will be 
replaced by another? 
  [Lordkipanidze] Most of those who have been fired are not 
robbers. It's just that, owing to their own subjective and 
objective traits they are not able to meet the required 
standards. Let me tell you the requirements which an airport 
customs post inspector must meet: a college education, 
completion of a special customs school or special courses, a 
customs service rank, fluency in Georgian and Russian as well as 
a working knowledge of another foreign language, age 35 or 
under, a "clean" record, good physical condition, good build and 
appearance, a high level of culture, and a certificate from a 
narcology clinic (some preference is given to women). 
  After all this, a half-year contract is signed with the 
inspector, which will be renewed after the trial period and 
certification. 
  In the past two years, no instruction has been provided; now 
this is given priority. 
  Since 10 January, training has been provided in specialized 
courses for persons recruited for customs service. These courses 
will be permanent and will be expanded by drawing upon 
qualifications-upgrading groups. An agreement has been signed 
stipulating that this year about 60 young people will be 
enrolled in one-month courses training customs service recruits 
in Moscow and Rostov. About 35 customs specialists will upgrade 
their qualifications in Moscow. More than 20 will take 
short-term study and training courses under Euro-Association 
auspices in customs schools and structures of Europe. By summer, 
plans call for opening a customs academy in Moscow, and a number 
of our young people will be sent there. 
  I think that Georgia's Customs Service must be depoliticized 
not only on paper but in deed, so that the political ups and 
downs taking place in the country cannot influence it. Its work 
has to be based on high professionalism and obedience to the law 
almost to the point of nitpicking. 
  [Correspondent] Still, what is your impression of the 
customs 
service from the inside? 
  [Lordkipanidze] Like others on the outside, I used to see 
two 
opposed forces--the smugglers trying to carry prohibited or 
unauthorized goods out of the country, currency, and historical 
and national treasures, and bring in narcotics, other 
psychotropic substances, weapons, ammunition, and so on. On the 
other side there were the dedicated customs officials who, 
sometimes at the cost of their life, tried to prevent smugglers 
and narcotics peddlers from breaking our laws and carrying 
material goods away. I respected honest customs officials and 
hated those who engaged in extortion and made dirty deals with 
smugglers and narcotics importers. 
  If you can believe it, that's the way it really is. That's 
why the battle must be without compromise. 
  [Correspondent] I believe you have a computerized 
export-import reporting network. How has it helped you? 
  [Lordkipanidze] We found that in 11 months of last year 
three 
times more goods left Georgia than came in. In another time and 
another country this would be taken as a positive; and we would 
have taken it that way also if we could be certain that all the 
earnings from the exports were coming into Georgia and not 
ending up in the safes of other countries. 
  Only 18 percent of the value of goods shipped out of Georgia 
on a barter basis came back in the form of commodities. 
  We have got used to seeing gas, utility services, and other 
bills being paid late or not paid at all. Unfortunately, many 
state and private structures owe billions to the state treasury. 
We have the ability to work with the National Bank, the 
Economics and Finance ministries, the Tax Inspection, and other 
departments to draft laws, regulations, and directives and, 
through the customs service, stop the commodities and currency 
drain and recover at least some of the old debts. 
  The introduction of an effective record-keeping system has 
made it possible to assign the Customs Department the task of 
assessing and collecting excise and value-added taxes, but 
nothing has been done about the fact that the Customs Department 
needs a new assessment and collection system of the kind it is 
not used to, and highly qualified specialists to run it. 
Therefore, it proved impossible to start this effort on 1 
February as the law stipulated. 
  The other day, however, at our request we went to the Head 
of 
State, and many essential decisions were made. 
  [Correspondent] What can you tell us about arming customs 
officials? 
  [Lordkipanidze] At first we asked for a 1,500-man customs 
security force with a general in charge in order to accommodate 
our official functions. But after several rounds of battle 
against the criminal world, my "appetite" got smaller. If border 
units are strengthened sufficiently, if they can seal off the 
smuggling routes and at the same time secure the safety of the 
customs posts, we will be content with smaller, mobile, 
fast-reaction detachments, well trained and armed with the best 
Alpha and Delta traditions, provided with the necessary 
transportation facilities--armored vehicles on land, patrol 
boats at sea, and helicopters in the sky. The equipment will be 
painted white and have its own insignia. 
  [Correspondent] What do you wish for most? 
  [Lordkipanidze] To set up posts on the Psou and the other 
side of the Roki Tunnel. 
  [Correspondent] Is that realistic? 
  [Lordkipanidze] Absolutely. It's just a matter of time!

<F P=106> [Interview with Georgian Acting General Procurator Dzhamlet </F>
Babilashvili by SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA Correspondent Davit 
Bitsadze: "Law and Order Is Not an End in Itself..."; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] He was born in Sagaredzho in 1942, the son of 
a jurist. He graduated with honors from Tbilisi State University 
in 1969 and went to graduate school. He is a candidate of 
juridical sciences. For a number of years he worked in the 
Georgian Academy of Sciences Economics and Law Institute, first 
as a junior and later as a senior researcher. He has published a 
number of scientific works. He has served in agencies of the 
Procuracy since 1977: he was Procurator of Sagaredzhoyskiy 
Rayon, First Deputy Transport Procurator of Transcaucasia, 
Deputy Chief and Department Chief of the Procuracy Investigative 
Administration of the Republic of Georgia, and Procurator of 
Kutaisi. In 1991-1992 he served as a judge on the Georgian 
Supreme Court, and was a member of the Presidium of that Court. 
In December 1992 he was appointed a Deputy General Procurator of 
the Republic of Georgia. He is now Acting General 
Procurator. 
  He is married and has three children. 
  [Bitsadze] Batono Dzhamlet, what is the Procuracy like 
today, 
and what problems does it face? 
  [Babilashvili] The transition period to Georgian statehood 
has also left its mark on the Procuracy. The old style and 
methods of the Procuracy have nearly been changed, but the new 
style and methods are not yet fully in place. In short, the 
Procuracy is a transition-stage state agency which is finding 
its place in the new system of state agencies. It will continue 
to function as the chief agency overseeing compliance with 
legality; its job is to see that the law is uniformly and fully 
complied with both by individual citizens and by officials and 
departments. The Procuracy has an investigative apparatus that 
is not very large but is very mobile and highly qualified to 
make its contribution to the fight against crime. 
  As for problems, we have plenty of them. People are tired of 
lawlessness and are waiting for the government to help. Still, 
crime is the most pressing problem. It is along this line that 
Procuracy organs, in my opinion, need to focus all their 
professionalism and efforts. It's true that it is the Internal 
Affairs and Security agencies that are on the front line of the 
battle, but the Procuracy can and must make its own hefty 
contribution. This is proved by the hundreds of difficult crime 
cases by which our investigative officers have caught and 
instituted criminal proceedings against many dangerous criminals 
such as murderers, terrorists, gangsters, and other violent 
felons. The Procuracy's evidence is used to jail dangerous 
criminals; in the courts my colleagues defend the state's 
interests in the battle against crime, monitor the lawful 
punishment of perpetrators, exercise oversight of convicts' 
serving of time in places of incarceration and of the lawfulness 
of investigation procedures in the Security and Internal Affairs 
agencies, and so on. We regularly analyze the crime situation in 
the Center and the outlying areas and draw up expert 
recommendations. 
  [Bitsadze] Laws enforced now were passed by the totalitarian 
regime. Doesn't this make your work harder? Could that be why 
the fight against crime has not been effective? 
  [Babilashvili] Completely new legal relations are now 
becoming established in our life, and naturally they will 
require the appropriate legislative adjustments. 
  However, because we are talking about crime we have to say 
that, in my opinion, a number of fundamental peculiarities are 
to be noted in this regard in the legislation that is in force: 
in some cases, a particular norm is clearly obsolete, an 
anachronism (for example, economic crimes); in other cases, 
however, many such norms are correct and in keeping with the 
times, but the necessary conditions for enforcing these laws are 
not yet in place. 
  Certainly, everything must be rectified in the course of 
time. The implementation of normal legislation, naturally, will 
improve the law enforcement agencies' effectiveness in keeping 
order. Future legislation work will have to take account of the 
realities of our life, the level of legal consciousness of the 
republic's citizens whom the norms are intended for, our 
national character, and other particular factors.... 
  There are other factors. In present legislation, for 
example, 
for some reason a situation has taken shape in which the law 
protects the criminal rather than the victim, against the 
interests of the injured party. It should be the opposite. 
  Especially today, when the victim of a crime is virtually 
terrorized, under great pressure from the criminal or his 
associates, and there is no mechanism in the laws to protect him 
from it. The same thing is true of a witness to a crime. It is 
this factor that is one important reason why a substantial 
number of cases are not solved, or if they are they never come 
to court because the victims or witnesses recant their initial 
testimony. This is understandable, because the people are afraid 
of the criminals and the state is not protecting them. I think 
immediate legislative measures must be taken to rectify that 
situation. 
  [Bitsadze] In your opinion, what are some of the features of 
crime today? What changes have there been? 
  [Babilashvili] Clearly, crime has become more organized. 
Organized gangs have come into being, crime has become their way 
of life. They have support in the state structures, they are 
economically very strong and have the right connections; they 
control certain territories and certain types of business and 
trade. Many such gangs are now legalized, and some of them have 
acquired status and, as is the fashion these days, they have 
infiltrated certain official structures (the law enforcement 
agencies have detailed information on them). The public is aware 
that the process of isolating them is underway, and hopefully we 
will finish the job. 
  Another peculiarity is that most registered crimes are of 
the 
violent category--murder, robbery, banditry. 
  I mentioned murder. There has probably never been such an 
increase in the number of murders in the history of Georgian 
crime. Sometimes there are as many as 10 murders a day in 
Georgia, and motiveless murders are also on the rise. 
  The criminal world has never been so well armed as today. 
You 
can find all kinds of firearms in the hands of criminals, to say 
nothing of communications devices, night vision devices, and so 
on. Most important, criminals can acquire firearms easily, 
securely, and without hesitation. Naturally, all of this makes 
it harder to fight crime and requires the use of additional 
detection, technical, and legal forms and methods. 
  [Bitsadze] Batono Dzhamlet, what do you think of the death 
penalty, also lynch law? 
  [Babilashvili] I am personally against the death penalty, 
but 
as a jurist and a procurator I denounce the savagery of the 
criminal world, whose criminal actions are characterized by 
unprecedented violence, cynicism, and arrogance. I think that 
society has to do something to protect itself, including the 
threat of the death penalty. Naturally, this is not really a 
solution to the problem, because the fight against crime, as we 
know, requires much more than making punishment tougher. It 
requires an integrated solution, and one element of that has to 
consider the supreme penalty--the death penalty. From this 
position, I believe that this extreme penalty is still necessary 
in today's Georgia. Life itself testifies to this. I'm referring 
to a situation that has taken shape in recent years: there is a 
widespread rumor that the death penalty has been abolished, and 
people have reacted with mob law, stoning criminals to death. 
This is not befitting to a nation having the kind of legal 
traditions we have. As a punishment, the death penalty has not 
been abolished in our country. Last year, in fact, the Georgian 
Parliament introduced execution by firing squad, along with 
other penalties, for two new grave crimes, among amendments in 
the Criminal Code (Article 65[.sup]1[/]--genocide--and 
Article 66[.sup]1[/]-- for a mercenary taking part in an 
armed conflict or battle). The criminal world has to realize 
that society does have a tough tool to protect itself from their 
depredations--the death penalty. 
  [Bitsadze] When the situation is real tough and all kinds of 
brutal and harsh crimes are being committed, how does the 
investigative apparatus work? 
  [Babilashvili] The republic's investigative apparatus is 
working at full capacity. Investigators of the Procuracy, the 
Security Ministry, and the Internal Affairs Ministry are 
investigating very serious cases, some of which are of great 
social resonance, including crimes by the ex-President's allies 
in western Georgia, ethnic cleansing and genocide of the 
Georgian population by the Abkhazian separatists, criminal 
violations in the monetary-credit system, the crimes of the 
Tatishvili brothers, the Sviri Brotherhood, the gangs operating 
in Guria and Lower Kartlia, and others. Not to mention the 
numerous cases of terrorism, murder, kidnapping, robbery, and 
other grave crimes. 
  Unfortunately, the republic's investigative apparatus is not 
yet very effective. Almost half of the grave crimes that are 
committed remain unsolved, and this adversely affects one 
fundamental principle of the fight against crime--namely, that 
liability for committing a crime must be inexorable. When 
criminals go unpunished, this encourages not only repeat 
criminals but also new persons to commit crimes. 
  It is true that a big share of the blame for this goes to 
the 
investigative and detective services, but there are reserves to 
be found here as well. Frequently, investigations drag on for no 
good reason, the quality of the investigation is rather low, and 
so on; naturally, citizens are justified in their complaints and 
dissatisfaction, and the Procuracy must exert more control in 
this regard. The investigative service, of course, has plenty of 
problems of its own, but that is another subject. 
  [Bitsadze] Wouldn't one solution be to create a separate 
investigative apparatus--that is, to form a unified 
investigative body? The way it is today, investigations are done 
separately by the Procuracy, the Internal Affairs Ministry, and 
Security.... 
  [Babilashvili] The suggestion to create a unified 
investigative apparatus is not new. It was being discussed back 
under the old Soviet regime, but for some reason no practical 
steps were taken. In the present former Soviet republics, now, 
there have been attempts to reform the investigative 
apparatuses, but it looks as if the effort has stalled. I 
believe that only Lithuania has a separate investigative 
committee. 
  The basic argument of those who favor creating a separate 
investigative apparatus is that the same agency ought not to 
both investigate and exercise oversight (it is the Procuracy 
they have in mind). This argument is probably well grounded. So 
some post-communist countries--Russia, for example--have taken 
the step of granting the accused the right to appeal a 
procurator's authorization to jail him as well as a decree to 
extend his jail term; of course, there are plenty of opponents 
to this legislative innovation. 
  What route we will take will be revealed by court reform. Of 
course, the creation of a separate investigative apparatus is no 
panacea. I can name several leading foreign countries in which 
there are more agencies having the right of preliminary 
investigation than we have. In the U.S., for example, more than 
five agencies do investigations: the FBI, the CIA, the Tax 
Collection Department, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Customs 
Service, and others. 
  Eminent specialists believe, however, that the point is not 
which department runs the investigation but how well it performs 
its role in the justice system. 
  [Bitsadze] The public is aware that cases of the allies of 
the ex-President are under investigation. Isn't there a danger 
of scores being settled with political adversaries? How 
effectively will the law be obeyed? 
  [Babilashvili] Not to be too categorical about it, I will 
say 
that such a precedent is ruled out. This has been stated 
repeatedly by leaders of the government and the law enforcement 
agencies, and it has been backed up by concrete actions. We have 
reconciled hundreds of persons who have voluntarily turned in 
their weapons, and criminal proceedings against them have been 
stopped. These are persons who are not guilty of a grave crime. 
  Naturally, clemency does not extend to persons who have 
inspired fratricidal civil war and national fragmentation and 
are guilty of grave sins. These people include certain deputies 
to the former Supreme Soviet and high officials of the former 
regime, the chairman of the government and certain members of 
the government, prefects, leaders of armed gangs, and so on who 
are subject to imprisonment. Some of them are already in 
custody, and some are being sought by the Internal Affairs and 
Security ministries as being guilty of grave crimes. The charges 
against them are criminal charges and have nothing to do with 
political motives. 
  [Bitsadze] The public is aware that the republic's 
enforcement ministries have been carrying out major operations 
against criminal gangs; they have been searching homes on a 
massive scale, jailing suspects, and so on. Isn't there a danger 
of ignoring the requirements of the law? 
  [Babilashvili] Whenever the enforcement ministries prepare 
for such operations, they have absolute information about the 
criminals, about the property they have obtained illegally, 
about their weapons, their narcotics stashes, wanted criminals, 
and other things, but for understandable reasons these do not 
require detailed discussion. As a rule, these operations are 
consulted on with the Procuracy, and we check on the legality of 
the plans. 
  The operations are participated in by the appropriate 
investigative officers, who ensure compliance with the law and 
the procedural aspects of detention, searches, and confiscation 
of any items obtained by criminal means. In short, we have 
created the necessary system to ensure the protection of 
citizens' legitimate rights. In general, though, such operations 
are new to our experience, necessitated by the requirements of 
the time; for its part, the Procuracy spares no effort to ensure 
that these encouraging efforts are made in compliance with the 
law. 
  [Bitsadze] You mentioned court reform. How do you envision 
it, and how does it tie in with the Procuracy? 
  [Babilashvili] A special decree of the Head of State has 
created a commission relating to court reform, and I am one of 
the co-chairmen of it. Court reform is essential, and it will be 
carried out as soon as stability is restored in the republic, 
when the executive branch has real control over processes in the 
country. Agencies of the Procuracy will also have to be reformed 
accordingl--but gradually, in stages. There are a number of 
ideas about that, sometimes mutually exclusive ones; there are 
also some fashionably extreme notions about abolishing the 
Procuracy as a state agency and turning its functions over to 
various other agencies. Time will tell how this matter is to be 
resolved. 
  I get the impression that there are forces in our country 
which are not pleased when such a legitimately academic and 
centralized body as the Procuracy is doing its job of protecting 
the state's interests. At one time these forces did everything 
they could to diminish enforcement departments such as the 
Security and the Internal Affairs agencies, and to some extent 
they achieved that. What we got as a result is clear to everyone. 
  [Bitsadze] At a time when people are settling scores with 
each other through the use of weapons, how realistic is it to 
speak of law enforcement? Doesn't it add up to legal nihilism? 
  [Babilashvili] To some extent it probably is, but let's also 
keep in mind that other countries on the road to freedom have 
been in similar and even worse shape and have still made it out 
of the crisis. It seems that a grave crime situation is the 
price society pays for democracy and freedom. Whatever 
difficulties we have, we must never forget the civilized form 
known as legal relations among men. The state and its agencies 
will have to do their part. We must strengthen citizens' faith 
in the law, while those who flout the law will have to be dealt 
with effectively, up to and including the use of force, and this 
is being done with increasing intensity. 
  [Bitsadze] One of the culminating stages of the justice 
system is punishment. How do things stand in Georgia in this 
regard? 
  [Babilashvili] Things are worrisome in that regard too. The 
system on which Soviet penitentiary policies were based--using 
prisoners as a cheap work force, the use of corrective labor, 
and so on, has been dismantled and is practically no more. The 
new conception, with its appropriate institutions and material 
base, is in the formation stage. Meanwhile, prisoners--or, 
rather, convicts--need to be maintained and employed, and this 
is one of our most serious problems right now. In fact, if the 
state cannot take care of a prisoner and comply with punishment 
procedures, its whole penal policy against crime will be in 
doubt. If we want to establish order, we will have to scale 
everything down, as they say, and take care of our prisoners in 
order to ensure continuity of the cycle of instituting criminal 
proceedings, court trial, and serving sentence. Otherwise these 
first two stages of the justice process will become purely a 
ritual, because criminal punishment will not fulfill the 
function which criminal law assigns to it in the fight against 
crime. 
  [Bitsadze] What are the prospects of the fight against 
crime? 
Is there any cause for optimism? 
  [Babilashvili] The fight against crime is a long and 
difficult process. Our task now is to bring crime under control, 
and our enforcement ministries really are up to that task. Once 
terrorism and banditry are wiped out, the crime rate curve will 
start to go down; hence, we really do have cause for optimism. 
Most important, public opinion is on our side; people want us to 
wipe out violence, robbery and looting and lawlessness; people 
want the chance to live and work normally. 
  [Bitsadze] Batono Dzhamlet, there has been considerable 
hullabaloo over bank credits these days. What is your position? 
What is the Procuracy doing about it? 
  [Babilashvili] By an order of the Head of State, we are 
tasked with coordinating all the work of checking the legality 
of credit issuance; this work is being done by the National 
Bank, the Chamber of Control, the Procuracy, and Security and 
Internal Affairs agencies. This work is going on quite 
intensively. Still, it is very difficult and time-consuming. 
About 20 criminal cases have been brought up to requirements and 
are underway. Suspects have been jailed, and investigation is 
underway. The disposition is such, in general, that the basic 
aim of the investigation is to recover the credits to the state, 
and persons who voluntarily pay their debt will be granted 
leniency according to the law. So far, billions of coupons have 
been returned to the state. The effort is continuing. It is made 
difficult by the fact that many of our countrymen have taken the 
hard currency gained by converting money "resurrected" from the 
credits (we're talking about millions) and stashed it in foreign 
banks. Unless they turn it in voluntarily, the appropriate legal 
steps will be taken to recover the illegally obtained monies. 
  [Bitsadze] There have been frequent explosions, sabotage, 
and 
terrorist acts, and various opinions about them have been 
published. What can you say about them, and what is the 
Procuracy doing? 
  [Babilashvili] All of these acts are state crimes according 
to the Criminal Code. It is because they are particularly 
dangerous that the State Security agencies are tasked with 
combatting them. The Procuracy is involved with these problems 
basically in terms of overseeing legality. 
  As to recent explosions, I know that intensive work is going 
on in the Security Ministry, and results will surely be 
forthcoming. 
  In general, along with the stepped-up assault on the world 
of 
crime a backlash is also quite possible, manifested in similar 
actions. Consider certain other factors as well: Do you think 
that in terms of safety everything has ended with the civil war? 
How many frustrated people are there, filled with the desire for 
revenge, because of their political bankruptcy and other base 
feelings? The war situation in Abkhazia and the fact that the 
republic's internal borders are unprotected make it imperative 
that we be alert and watchful. Consider, also, the mafia clans' 
struggle for spheres of influence. Hence, the various agencies 
have plenty to worry about. Until a crime is solved and the 
specific criminal is identified, therefore, it is difficult and 
probably awkward to assert anything categorically. 
  Many worthy men have fallen in the fight against crime, 
including many law enforcement officers. Sad to say, some of 
their murders remain unsolved today. Consider, in particular, 
the treacherous murder of the Procurator of Tbilisi; serious 
efforts are underway to solve it, and the results are 
encouraging. We consider solving it to be a matter of the honor 
of the republic's Procuracy. 
  [Bitsadze] Material incentives play a big part in the 
interests of Procuracy officers. How do things stand in that 
regard? 
  [Babilashvili] Things are not very well in that regard. 
Practically everything these days depends on the officers' 
enthusiasm and professional dedication. Many of them couldn't 
make it and have transferred to other structures, and others are 
quitting now. The majority realize that almost everyone is 
having trouble these days, and they're waiting patiently for a 
better future. 
  The Procuracy needs help if we are going to be able to work 
somehow. This refers to transportation, fuel, equipment and 
supplies, and so on. We don't have the resources to have new 
uniforms made, and all kinds of other things I won't talk about 
now. All we ask is the minimum necessary to maintain the 
institution and keep a qualified cadre nucleus. 
  [Bitsadze] Batono Dzhamlet, what you have said should 
encourage readers who have suffered so much bitterness and pain 
in recent years. Can you add anything? 
  [Babilashvili] A true Procuracy officer has always 
sympathized with anyone who is a victim of lawlessness. For a 
professional there is nothing more saddening and depressing than 
for someone to be in trouble and nothing can be done to help him 
or ease the situation because of circumstances. And, sad to say, 
there are such cases in our experience. Eventually, undoubtedly, 
everything will fall into place, and law and order, based on 
reason, will triumph. Naturally, this is not an end in itself. 
It is the means by which to open the way to constructive labor 
and ensure Georgia's economic and spiritual revival. My wish for 
our people is that that time will come soon.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of State Givi Lominadze, chairman </F>
of the Temporary Committee on Emergency Situations in the West 
Georgian Zone, by Rusudan Lordkipanidze: "`It's a Long Way to 
Complete Calm"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] "The situation in western Georgia is somewhat 
better. Processes are manageable, but we are still a long way 
from complete stabilization," Minister of State Givi Lominadze 
said recently at a session of Parliament; he is chairman of the 
Temporary Committee on Emergency Situations in Georgia's Western 
Zone. 
  And no wonder: as long as the front line runs along the 
Inguri, the process of reconciliation of supporters of the 
former government has not been completed (by no means have all 
the opponents of the present government extended the hand of 
friendship to us), and they have yet to be disarmed, it's still 
a long way to complete calm. 
  Recently the Georgian Parliament's Juridical Commission 
and the Justice Ministry drafted a statute "On Temporary 
Commissions for the Reconciliation of Supporters of the 
Government of the Ex-President, Attached to Local Administrative 
Bodies in the Emergency Situation Zone of Western Georgia," 
stipulating the creation, organization, and operational 
procedures and jurisdiction of the Reconciliation Commission 
(that is what it is called for short). 
  As we know, Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze last 
year, in October, called upon all fighters in the 
Gamsakhurdia-Kobalia ranks to turn in their weapons and give 
themselves up. At the same time, a guarantee of immunity was 
given to anyone who had not committed a grave crime. The task of 
studying the cases of those who turned themselves in was turned 
over to the Procuracy. Why, then, has it become necessary to set 
up reconciliation commissions? We asked Givi Lominadze to answer 
this question and explain the statute. 
  Districts of Mingrelia, unfortunately, are suffering 
from an information famine. Owing to the particular urgency of 
this article, therefore, we asked Communications Minister Pridon 
Indzhia to do everything possible to see that this edition makes 
it into Mingrelia. 
  "When chaos reigns in the country," Batoni Givi said, "when 
illegal armed units are roaming in rather large areas--and not 
just units but criminal armed gangs which, by their treacherous 
actions, basically caused the loss of the war in Abkhazia--at a 
time when weapons and medicine were supposed to be sent to the 
front but never got there, and a hostile force was formed in our 
rear and not only betrayed us but worked in harmony with the 
enemy, openly joined forces with outside mercenaries and 
Abkhazian separatists, and almost got as far as Kutaisi, the 
government had no choice but to use force. The government was 
also aware that those forces also included numerous persons who 
had gone astray and lost their way. This is what impelled the 
Head of State to make his appeal, in which he showed clearly 
that the government was not interested in reprisals. The 
Procuracy's agencies would run a check of all adversaries who 
had turned in their weapons voluntarily, and anyone not guilty 
of war crimes, anyone who had made a mistake and been deceived, 
would be granted clemency by the Georgian government and Eduard 
Shevardnadze personally as the Head of State, in accordance with 
legislation in force; such persons would be treated humanely and 
helped to return to their homes in safety. Many heeded this 
call, many didn't. There was some misunderstanding in the law 
enforcement agencies as well. Persons who came over to the 
present government's side were supposed to be investigated only 
by the Procuracy's agencies, yet that work was undertaken by the 
Internal Affairs Ministry and the Security Ministry, structures 
of the Defense Ministry, and a number of officials having the 
right qualifications but not the jurisdiction; this resulted in 
provocative rumors as well as unlawful actions on the part of 
some law enforcement structures and, in many cases, specific 
subjects. This is what necessitated the creation of an 
institution designed to detect organized groups and armed 
formations supporting the ex-president in the emergency zones of 
western Georgia, as well as persons acting against the Georgian 
government in other ways, and examine their actions in a 
collegial manner, taking account of public opinion. 
  "Let me say also that any affirmative decision by the 
Commission does not have the force of law; it is not the final 
authority in the matter. It is supposed to study public opinion 
in particular rayons and cities, relay it to Procuracy agencies, 
and they, in turn, are to take account of it in making their 
decision, if the investigation has not revealed any grave crime 
committed by the specific person. 
  The reconciliation commissions are set up under regional and 
rayon-level administrative bodies in western Georgia's emergency 
zone. 
  [Lordkipanidze] Who are the members of the commissions? 
  [Lominadze] Officials of regional (rayon-level) 
administrative bodies, members of Parliament elected from the 
relevant electoral districts, deputies to the local agencies of 
authority, and representatives of the public--all with an equal 
vote, of course. 
  [Lordkipanidze] Could you say a couple of words about the 
rights and duties of the Reconciliation Commission? 
  [Lominadze] To coordinate the activity of law enforcement 
and 
other state and civic bodies to detect and reconcile persons, 
groups of persons, and armed units in opposition to the 
government of Georgia, if, as I mentioned, they have not 
committed a grave crime; within its jurisdiction, to coordinate 
the activity of local law enforcement agencies in order to 
prevent the punishment of persons who oppose the government but 
have not committed a grave crime, who have turned in their 
weapons and ammunition, and have sincerely repented of their 
actions; to create all the conditions necessary to see that such 
persons are returned to their place of work and residence; to 
give them guarantees of a peaceful life; and many other 
things.... 
  [Lordkipanidze] What are the procedures of the Commission's 
work? 
  [Lominadze] Basically it will work on the basis of citizens' 
individual or group statements, also petitions coming in from 
enterprises, organizations, and establishments, and 
representations from law enforcement agencies. The materials are 
to be examined in 10 days and a well-motivated decision made. 
  [Lordkipanidze] What happens if it is found that the actions 
of a person or group of persons are criminal? 
  [Lominadze] The material is turned over to investigative 
agencies. 
  [Lordkipanidze] Is it possible to appeal a decision of the 
Reconciliation Commission or an action taken by it in connection 
with the examination of a case? 
  [Lominadze] It can be done in the Temporary Committee of the 
Emergency Zone, which has the right to overturn the Commission's 
decision. 
  [Lordkipanidze] I understand that such commissions have been 
set up under all the city and rayon administrations in the 
emergency zone. When are they to take action on the statute? 
  [Lominadze] The statute has been sent out and has been in 
force since 10 March. [end of Q and A] 
  One more cause for hope on the way to stabilization, 
perhaps not in vain.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Volkov: "They Want Credit Emission from </F>
the Government--But Have Doubts About the Solvency of the 
Council of Ministers"] 
  [Text] The most reliable source of financing for the 
territories of Russia is credit emission. We can only welcome 
this candid statement issued by Oksana Dmitriyeva, chairperson 
of the State Duma Subcommittee on Financing for the Territories. 
Finally the Russian parliament has gotten the opportunity to 
translate the unintelligible groaning of the opposition into 
normal language with an intelligible vocabulary. 
  The results of parliamentary hearings on the draft budget 
for 
1994 presented by the government are as follows: The most 
competent Duma members have shown that state income in the 
budget is overstated due to the fact that production volume 
decreased more heavily than was presumed (by 25 percent instead 
of the 8 percent contained in December calculations of the 
Ministry of Economics), while additional state investments 
should be added to the expenditures. 
  The State Duma will not be able to create a full-fledged 
conciliation committee capable of reaching consensus together 
with the government. According to Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of 
the Duma Budget Committee, this would mean "violation of the 
principle of separation of powers." On the other hand, Sergey 
Shapovalov, chairman of the Committee for Regional Policy, 
insists that a common working group is needed--true, its 
decisions would be "advisory in nature." 
  In other words, the State Duma is attempting to find 
roundabout ways, having come into conflict with the statute it 
readily adopted on procedure for adoption of the budget. This 
statute prohibits the adoption of additional expenditure 
resolutions without either a confirmation of supplemental 
sources of income or the reduction of expenditures with respect 
to other budget lines. In point of fact, taking into account 
growing pressure on the part of intragovernmental groups aimed 
at increasing outlays, an "advisory"--i.e., unofficial--working 
group might "convince" the Ministry of Finance to a possibly 
greater degree than would open confrontation during the course 
of the official procedure for adopting the budget. Especially 
since there seem to be additional sources through which the 
government can obtain income--the removal of tax benefits for 
exporters, estimated by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the 
Economics Committee, to amount to R24 trillion, and by Aleksandr 
Pochinok, deputy chairman of the Budget Committee, at 
approximately R10 trillion. But as Mr. Pochinok noted, it would 
be more proper to first repeal the legal resolutions affording 
such benefits, and only then introduce the new income into the 
budget... 
  The situation is further complicated by the fact that the 
Duma has assumed the responsibility to begin examination of the 
budget at the end of next week. In the meantime, according to 
the Budget Committee chairman, the draft presented does not 
conform to selected excerpts from the president's correspondence 
with the parliament--there is no line in it about additional 
funds which must be expended on the closure of a number of coal 
mines, for example, or the readjustment to be made at military 
plants, etc. In Mr. Zadornov's words, "the affording of 
additional funds must be conditioned upon plans for a framework 
restructuring of the economy." This requirement does not 
presently appear to be entirely realistic, however--and not only 
because an effective concept of framework restructuring is 
lacking. It also proceeds from the insincerity of politicians 
who strive to effect institutional changes in words, while in 
fact sustaining bankruptcy and conserving the Soviet industry. 
  Claims of the State Duma to the effect that new methods are 
being used to finance the regions out of the federal budget 
appear to be quite justified. As we know, the government has 
adopted a system of transfers, accumulating income in the 
federal fund for support to the regions from value-added tax, 
and then transferring it to the most needy regions. However, 
coefficients used by the Council of Ministers either were 
calculated employing incorrect methodology or proceeding from 
political considerations. For example, Kemerovo Oblast finds 
itself in first place in the list of needy regions, and of 66 
subsidized regions it will receive almost half the funds 
accumulated. Objecting to this is not only Yabloko, but the 
Russia's Choice faction as well. However, competent opponents of 
the government's program from the "Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin" 
bloc have additional, nontechnical objections to the principles 
of regional financing proposed by the Ministry of Finance. Mrs. 
Dmitriyeva stated yesterday that since the decline in production 
should lead to reduced volumes of value-added tax, the source of 
financing for the subsidy fund for the regions must be 
different--direct credit emission, to be precise. In this 
regard, observers are proposing that taxes be repealed entirely 
and that the economy be financed from a computation of minimum 
necessary outlays, but that in such event the parliament be 
dissolved as the source of idle talk about this minimum and the 
government be cleansed of officials who attempt to defend sector 
interests.

"Budget-94: 'A Forward-Looking Economic Policy Could Be Started 
as Early as the Second Half of 1994'"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  What Kind of Economic Policy Has Been Built Into the Budget? </H5>
  A conspicuous reduction in the domestic expenditures of the 
state is the first point that should be noted. The official 
deficit of the federal budget--62.4 trillion rubles [R]--equals 
approximately one-third of its expenditures and comes to 8.6 
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). This is less than 
last year (10.5 percent of GDP). However, the reduction in state 
expenditures in real terms and the hardening of monetary policy 
are not restricted to two percentage points; they are much 
greater. 
  The expenditure side of the budget includes quite a number 
of 
new items which were not included in last year's budget. For the 
relative size of domestic expenditures of the budget to be 
comparable with last year, the following should be subtracted 
from the amount of expenditures in 1994: 
  --state guarantees for foreign loans--R12.8 trillion 
(previously they were not taken into account within the budget, 
and from 1994 on they are registered in the budget twice, as 
financing for the deficit and as budget expenditures). In 
general terms, these are mythical, nonexistent expenditures; 
they will not occur actually, i.e. as payment of funds from the 
budget, this year, and in the years to come--only in the event 
that the enterprises that have received these loans are unable 
to pay them back); 
  --financial support fund for northern territories--R6.6 
trillion, and expenditures for conversion--R0.8 trillion (the 
monies in these items were previously provided as loans from the 
Bank of Russia); 
  --the debt of the budget for 1993--about R4 trillion (has 
already been paid in the first quarter); 
  --the increment of expenditures for serving the foreign 
debt--R6 trillion (more than $2 billion). 
  Therefore, the real domestic expenditures of the state under 
comparable methodology will decline by about R30 trillion 
rubles, and the size of the deficit will decline by almost a 
factor of two and come to merely one-fifth of the expenditures 
and less than 5 percent of GDP. 
  It should also be taken into account that the interest rate 
on credit from the Bank of Russia has become positive in recent 
months, i.e. it exceeded the growth of prices, that the 
extension of easy credit and subsidization of imports were 
canceled, and that a number of other restrictions in monetary 
policy were introduced. Therefore, the government is planning a 
perceptible hardening of the budgetary and monetary policy for 
1994. 
  The tax burden is growing noticeably: 
  --profit tax has been increased by 6 percent (of which 3 
percent is for the federal budget), 
  --a special tax has been introduced--actually, value-added 
tax has been raised by 3 percent; 
  --the tax on assets has been raised to 2 percent; this 
amounts to a very sharp increase given a reappraisal of the cost 
of enterprise assets by a factor of 27 effective 1 January 1994 
(in 1994 proceeds by virtue of this tax are projected to be 20 
times greater than in 1993); 
  --transportation tax has been introduced (1 percent of the 
labor compensation fund); 
  --customs duties on imports were increased effective 15 
March. 
  At the same time a number of preferences in profit tax have 
been granted; however, in grand total the government plans to 
collect 16.6 percent of GDP for the federal budget, instead of 
the 10.6 percent last year. Even after the nontax proceeds are 
subtracted, the tax load on the economy for funding federal 
expenditures will increase by a factor of almost 1.5. 
  Nonetheless, despite the tax increase the revenues of the 
budget appear to be overstated. Budget revenue calculations 
clearly fail to take into account the industrial slump, the 
mounting volume of nonpayments, the flight of capital, and an 
increase in the "average" resourcefulness of merchants in terms 
of tax evasion. In the first two months of 1994 only 8 percent 
of GDP in taxes was successfully collected by the federal 
budget, whereas a statistic from the beginning of last year is 
built into the calculations which is clearly unrealistic. 
  Given that the revenue calculations are overstated, it will 
become necessary to cut back expenditures as revenues are really 
taken in, that is, the domestic expenditures of the state will 
be reduced even below the level planned in the budget, which is 
low to begin with. 
  While the overall tax burden increases, the government turns 
out to be unable to take specific and realistic measures to 
increase budget revenues. 
  Thus, in keeping with the Law on the Customs Tariff which 
was 
passed last year, an overwhelming majority of customs 
preferences were to be canceled effective 1 January 1994 because 
the rates of customs duty were to be uniform and not subject to 
change. The government has been unable to cancel these 
preferences and apparently is not planning to do so. A shortfall 
in budget revenues on account of the granted preferences exceeds 
$4 billion (R12 trillion) in terms of duties alone, and 
considerably more taking into account value-added tax and the 
excise tax on imports. Besides, the government exempts from the 
levying of duties and taxes almost $20 billion in foreign trade 
turnover consisting of centrally exported and imported items 
(loss in duties alone--up to $3 billion). 
  The budget does not sufficiently account for the possibility 
of increasing proceeds from privatization, as well as the growth 
of revenues in conjunction with the consolidation of off-budget 
and "ministerial" funds in the budget. Despite the decisions 
made to merge these funds, this has not been actually done. 
<H5>  Budgetary Expenditures </H5>
  On the whole the budget expenditures are planned to increase 
by a factor of 4.5 compared to 1993 (under the comparable 
calculation method described above), with revenues planned to 
increase by a factor of 7.1. 
  State investment from the federal budget comes to about 2 
percent of GDP (even according to initial calculations for the 
budget it came to 3 percent). Priority investment programs have 
virtually not been distinguished in the draft. The assistance 
fund for small businesses and entrepreneurship comes to less 
than one-hundredth of 1 percent of budget expenditures. Out of 
almost R8 trillion in subsidies for the coal industry, only R0.3 
trillion is earmarked for a program of reorganization and 
closure of unpromising enterprises; the rest of the amount 
constitutes a grant to the industry to carry out the pay scale 
agreement (wages), to maintain social services facilities, and 
so on. The reorganization fund is not envisioned at all in other 
sectors. Funds allocated for conversion (R0.8 trillion) are not 
an investment in the reorganization of production for 
manufacturing civilian products at defense enterprises, as one 
might think; instead, grants for wages or to maintain social 
infrastructure facilities account for four-fifths of these 
funds. In real terms, proceeds from privatization will decline 
compared to 1993, although last year privatization for checks 
proceeded whereas in the second half of this year a transition 
must be made to privatization at a fee. 
  The structure of budget expenditures is inertial in nature 
and appears to be called upon to merely "patch holes" in the 
economy. Of the entire complex of economic policy measures, only 
the policy of restricting state expenditures and the growth of 
money supply is implemented very consistently. 
<H5>  Is the Budget Policy in Line With the Existing Situation? </H5>
  Some economists might be getting the impression that a 
"victory" over inflation is near: The rate of inflation has been 
falling consistently since August 1993. It appears that the 
objectives set for economic policy will be reached any minute. 
  Of course, a normal economic situation presupposes stable 
prices or prices growing slowly (up to 10 percent a year). 
However, is the direct path toward the goal always the best? 
  As a result of consistent policy, in the fall of 1993 
enterprises have for the second time since 2 January 1992 ended 
up in a situation of rigid financial restrictions. Two years ago 
enterprises responded with an increase in nonpayments, with the 
volume of production falling slightly. They reacted differently 
at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994. 
  Industrial enterprises no longer have the funds to purchase 
raw materials and subcontracted parts, and are forced to reduce 
production. In the fall of 1993 industry experienced the most 
feeble seasonal pickup in all the years of crisis. In January 
1994 (during the period of traditional seasonal stability), 
there was an unprecedented decline, by 12 to 17 percent compared 
to the December 1993 level according to various estimates. The 
decline in one month was virtually equal to that for all of 
1993! In February the volume of industrial production stabilized 
at the extremely low January level, thus confirming that the 
decline in January was not random in nature. In the process the 
volume of production in machine building dropped by more than 
one-half compared to January 1993 (according to preliminary data 
it fell by one-quarter in industry as a whole in the first 
quarter of this year). 
  The worsening financial standing and stoppages of 
enterprises 
are bringing about a rapid growth of arrears in the payment of 
wages and forced furloughs for workers. In the last five months 
(October 1993 through February 1994), arrears in the issuance of 
funds for labor compensation in industry, construction, and 
agriculture increased by a factor of 5.2, of which in the last 
two months--by a factor of 2.6. As of 1 March more than 8,000 
industrial enterprises had arrears; in February the latter 
exceeded the monthly labor compensation fund at these 
enterprises by a factor of 1.25. A reduction in effective demand 
by workers who have failed to receive wages restricts final 
demand even more. 
  Mounting financial difficulties hit the budget like a 
boomerang: Proceeds from the profit tax are dropping sharply (in 
conjunction with reduced profits), as are those from value-added 
tax (in conjunction with mounting nonpayments), income tax, and 
some other taxes. The economy ends up in a vicious circle: 
Failing to receive revenues, the budget reduces expenditures, 
which diminishes the value of final demand; this brings about a 
worsening of the financial standing of enterprises, lower 
profits, and growing nonpayments. The knot becomes ever tighter. 
As the results of January and February indicate, even a direct 
tax increase does not bring about an increase in budget 
proceeds; losses due to the deterioration of the economic 
situation are considerably greater. The increase in import 
duties effective 15 March will most likely bring about smaller 
budget revenues due to a reduction in imports. 
  Shortfalls in financing for agriculture are one of the 
reasons for a reduction in the planted area. In the fall of 
1993, an area 20 percent smaller was planted in winter crops, 
which will bring about a loss of the crop of approximately the 
same magnitude. Planted areas are likely to shrink in the spring 
of 1994, too. This means that there will be fewer foodstuffs 
this year, and they will be more expensive. In 1992 and 1993 the 
slump in agriculture was minimal, and this mitigated the 
deterioration of the economic situation in the country. In 1994 
the situation might change, and a reduction in agricultural 
production will accelerate the industrial slump rather than 
mitigate it. 
  The policy of increasing taxes and cutting back on budget 
expenditures will not actually bring about a reduction in the 
deficit. It will bring about a cataclysmic fall in production, 
deterioration of the financial situation in the economy, and a 
surge in the budget deficit; paradoxical as it may be, as a 
result of this policy revenues will grow (inflation!) 
conspicuously slower than expenditures. 
  The general economic situation in Russia obviously 
deteriorated sharply at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 
1994. In this situation, the government prefers to pretend that 
nothing special is happening. However, if the deterioration 
continues at the same rate, the most elementary projecting 
methods result in an estimated slump in industry of more than 30 
percent, i.e. almost by a factor of 1.5, rather than 8 percent 
(as in the original projection of the government), 12 percent 
(as in the revised projection), and not even 20 percent (as in 
the pessimistic projection)! 
  Let us recall that the president's Budget Message for 1993 
submitted to the Supreme Soviet contained the following 
macroeconomic projection: inflation--a factor of 3.4 during the 
year, slump in industry--7 percent, budget deficit--7.2 percent 
of GDP and about 25 percent of expenditures. The actual numbers 
for 1993 were: inflation--a factor of 10, slump--16.2 percent, 
budget deficit--10.5 percent of GDP and about one-half of 
expenditures (and then only at the price of rigid restrictions 
and debts of the budget carried over into 1994). 
  If we look at the 1992-1993 situation as a whole and try to 
distinguish the principal causes of this profound fall in the 
volume of industrial production (just under a factor of 2), we 
can distinguish two causes--a reduction in investment and a loss 
of sales markets. 
  The government projects a further decline in investment for 
1994. Indeed, there is no hope that investment will grow under 
the stated policy. Undoubtedly, investment from the budget will 
be extremely limited (in conjunction with attempts to achieve 
inflation-control goals). Following the events of 21 September-4 
October 1993, the investment climate for domestic, to say 
nothing of foreign, private capital investment is extremely 
unfavorable in view of sharply higher political risk. This is 
why new decisions will be needed in order to stabilize the 
volume of investment--yet another revision of the cost of fixed 
assets of enterprises, the expansion of centralized credit 
provision through government channels, or an increase in the 
budget deficit. 
  Between 1989 and 1993 Russia successively lost traditional 
markets for the sale of its products. The markets of the former 
socialist countries were lost from 1989 through 1991 in 
conjunction with the disintegration of the Council for Mutual 
Economic Assistance. The markets of the former Union republics 
were lost in 1992 and 1993 in view of the deliberate liquidation 
of the united ruble zone by Russia. Finally, in 1993 Russia 
began to lose its own domestic market in conjunction with the 
policy of stabilizing the exchange rate of the ruble in the 
environment of high inflation: Imported products are crowding 
out the domestic producer. 
<H5>  The Budget as an Instrument of Economic Policy </H5>
  It is impossible to bring inflation in the Russian economy 
down in the short term; its roots are profoundly institutional 
and structural in nature. Regardless of the will and wishes of 
reformers, the Russian economy has entered a phase of 
fluctuations which is known in economic science under the name 
of "stop and go" [rendered in English in the original]: Periods 
of stricter monetary policy give way to periods of relaxation. 
This sets a certain cycle in the economic and political life of 
the country. However, in this instance it is necessary to feel 
quite clearly the change in policy from "stop" to "go." In late 
1993 and early 1994 this change is obviously due. Persisting in 
the "stop" policy is bringing about an ever greater slump in 
production in industry and agriculture, deterioration in the 
structure of the economy, stoppages at enterprises, and rapid 
growth of first hidden and then overt unemployment, with all the 
ensuing social and political conflicts. 
  We consider institutional and structural transformations in 
the economy against the background of relatively stable and 
predictable budgetary and monetary policies of the state to be 
the main tasks of economic policy at present, rather than 
fighting inflation. Our main priorities in economic policy 
should be as follows: 
  --growth of state investment (budget and off-budget) and 
incentives for private investment; formation of the capital 
market; 
  --incentives for shifts in the structure of production in 
favor of products of final demand and those with a high degree 
of upgrading; 
  --support from the state for reforms in all sectors of the 
economy. 
  To properly devise the budget for 1994 it is first of all 
necessary to build into it a realistic, realizable macroeconomic 
projection designed with the likely influence of the economic 
policy of the state taken into account. 
  In view of the worsening macroeconomic situation in Russia 
at 
the beginning of 1994, a minimum task should be set before the 
budget for 1994: to strive to refrain from worsening the main 
macroeconomic characteristics compared to last year. The 
impatient aspiration to improve these characteristics quickly 
has already resulted in a cataclysmic slump in industry. This is 
why, in view of the results of the first quarter of 1994, the 
deterioration of the indicator of the industrial slump can no 
longer be avoided. It is realistic to proceed from the statistic 
of decline in industrial production of 20-25 percent this year 
(that is, the maintenance at the end of the year of the level of 
production of the first quarter of this year). 
  For the most part, the state is left with the device of 
funding out of the deficit in order to slow down the fall this 
year. This device should be used. Of course, in the process it 
is necessary to contain inflation within certain limits, for 
example, 15-20 percent per month this year, with this plank 
subsequently being reduced yearly. 
  It would be necessary to use the secured "respite" in 
fighting inflation in order to develop reforms in the principal 
sectors of the economy. 
  This is how a budget for 1994 which would reflect such an 
economic policy could look in terms of the principal economic 
parameters. 
  The revenue base should be real. This means that, on one 
hand, the standard of collected taxes should not be overstated, 
and on the other, it will be necessary to take full advantage of 
the potential to augment revenues. Unfortunately, the 
possibilities for increasing revenues are few. Most of them are 
associated with foreign economic operations--revision of the 
volume of product transactions to meet state needs (it is 
necessary to sharply reduce it), as well as compliance with the 
requirements of the Law "On the Customs Tariff" with regard to 
the cancellation of preferences in export and import operations. 
However, the cancellation of preferences will likely necessitate 
a partial increase in directed grants and state investment, 
which will be included on the expenditure side of the federal 
budget. It is necessary to think over the possibility of 
increasing proceeds from post-voucher privatization. It is 
necessary to consolidate most off-budget funds within the 
federal budget, with their expenditure side analyzed. Of course, 
it is necessary to step up monitoring of the collection of 
taxes, as well as export and foreign exchange controls. 
  The proportion of state expenditures in the budget for this 
year should be approximately at the same level as in 1993, and a 
little higher--in proportion to the growth of budget revenues. 
This puts the size of the budget deficit at 40-50 percent of its 
expenditures. 
  However, with a view to ensuring a turnaround in the future, 
it is necessary to change the structure of the expenditure side 
of the budget: Expenditures should be increased for items that 
will produce real returns in the long term. 
  This is primarily investment. It is necessary to make 
investment in keeping with the special-purpose federal programs 
developed by the Ministry of the Economy. In this instance it is 
better to follow the path of increasing financing for already 
approved investment programs without starting new ones, and of 
concentrating investment on construction sites that are close to 
completion. Of course, it is necessary to improve the quality of 
the development of such programs, taking into account world 
experience of project financing and perhaps with technical 
assistance from international financial organizations. In 
addition, investment along the lines of joint financing of 
special-purpose programs of local budgets is promising, as well 
as joint financing with the private sector (primarily but not 
only in housing construction); the latter is particularly 
significant for enlivening investment activity. Federal 
investment should not come as a grant in the course of joint 
financing; it is necessary to record it as a share of the 
property of the enterprise being built (retrofitted), with the 
possible privatization of this share in the future. The 
mechanism for financing the difference in interest rates on 
long-term loans out of the budget may be used more actively. 
Measures of state support for the development of a capital 
market are necessary--a reduction in taxes on operations with 
securities, incentives for an active investment policy on the 
part of state and nonstate institutional investors, and the 
creation of an infrastructure for the development of investment 
projects (investment banks and companies, a change in the 
direction of work of the Committee for the Management of State 
Property, and so on) etc. 
  Second, there are expenditures for real reforms. This is 
support for small businesses (for example, the budget fund could 
be increased by a factor of 50 to 100), an increase in the fund 
for enterprise reorganization in the coal industry and the 
creation of a similar fund for enterprises from other 
industries; a state program for voluntary enterprise 
bankruptcies; realistic conversion programs associated with the 
reorganization of production; active shaping of the labor 
market; reorientation of the privatization process away from 
distribution of property by checks toward holding auctions and 
investment competitions (won by those who want to invest the 
most); incentives for exports and import substitution, and many 
other things. 
  Third, these are appropriations for science, culture, 
education, and health care--not an increase in expenditures for 
all items in these sectors but rather financing for reforms in 
them: a transition to funding mostly scientific projects rather 
than institutes; incentives for a transition to insurance-based 
health care; tax exemptions for noncommercial activities, and so 
on. Finally, appropriations for defense should be used to 
mitigate the consequences of already planned reductions in the 
strength of the army and its transition to a greater degree to 
the professional principle of organization; changes in the 
structure of the state defense requisition; and meeting 
disarmament obligations. 
  Much of what has been described here can and should be done 
as early as in the 1994 budget. We propose to reject in the 
first reading the draft 1994 federal budget submitted by the 
government and to return it to the government for revisions. One 
month could suffice for the government to do this. It would then 
be possible to manage to approve the budget before the beginning 
of the third quarter in view of the fact that the budget for the 
second quarter has already been approved, and that the specially 
developed accelerated procedure for approval of a budget by the 
Duma takes 40 days. 
  In view of the sharply higher instability of the economic 
situation in Russia, the real lead time in budgetary planning 
comes to one or two quarters. This is why it can be recommended 
that the government submit to the Duma a budget for the third 
quarter or for the second half of the year. Correspondingly, 
quarterly reports on implementation of the budget should be 
submitted (as of today even the 1992 report has not been 
submitted to the Duma, to say nothing of the first quarter of 
1994). 
  It is necessary to consider the federal budget together with 
other fundamental decisions on economic policy--confirmation of 
the Main Directions for Monetary Policy and the reports and 
budgets of the off-budget funds. Besides, a macroeconomic 
projection and calculations for the consolidated budget (that 
is, those with the drafts of regional budgets) in primary form 
are needed within the Budget Message in order for a decision to 
be made. Unfortunately, not one of these documents has been 
submitted for consideration by the Duma so far. 
<H5>  * * * </H5>
  The 1994 federal budget is unacceptable in the form in which 
it was submitted. It is too harsh for our economy, which is 
still ailing. If the budget were rejected in the first reading, 
with precise recommendations given for revising it, a 
forward-looking economic policy could be started as early as the 
second half of 1994. The 1995 budget could then be developed 
proceeding from the accomplishments of 1994. Of course, we could 
hardly expect a quick improvement in the socioeconomic 
situation. However, it is important to embark on a path that 
leads out of the abyss as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Shlemovich Gontmakher, deputy minister </F>
for social protection of the Russian Federation and candidate of 
economic sciences, and Tatyana Yugay, chief analyst of the 
Analytical Center for Socioeconomic Policy of the Office of the 
President of the Russian Federation and doctor of economic 
sciences: "Social Policy: In Which Direction To Navigate?"] 
  [Text] "The need for the creation of truly targeted 
social protection has long been urgent and overdue even. Its 
nucleus should be composed of personal work with everyone who 
appeals for assistance." 
  The social sphere in the best socialist times was the 
unloved 
stepdaughter of the military-industrial complex, and now her 
wicked sister--financial stabilization, which is aiming to cut 
the already scant expenditure on social needs--has shown up. And 
as always when it comes time to tighten the screws, it is the 
people who are left carrying the can. Yet the social sphere is 
the space of people's direct vital activity, of our sole and 
unique life, which we want to live not just any old how, roughly 
and in haste, but with dignity, and if not as in civilized 
countries, then with minimal conveniences, at least. 
  Meanwhile our country is increasingly becoming an extremely 
unpropitious and even dangerous sphere of habitation. A threat 
to the health and normal reproduction of the population has been 
created. In the last three years alone the birthrate has fallen 
from 13.4 to 9.2 per mill, and mortality has risen from 11.2 to 
14.6 per mill. As a result, society is becoming depopulated: In 
the past year alone it declined by 300,000. The natural 
population decrease has become particularly threatening in 
Central Russia. Mortality at the able-bodied age is increasing 
at a preferential rate, and, what is particularly alarming, the 
already high child and infant mortality is growing also. 
  The sanitary-epidemiological situation has deteriorated. In 
the past three years alone morbidity from diphtheria has 
increased by a factor of 12.3, from measles, by a factor of 4.1, 
typhoid, 1.5, and tuberculosis of the respiratory organs, by a 
factor of 1.3. The growth of infectious diseases is a direct 
consequence of the deterioration in the quality of food and the 
sanitary state of the cities and villages. 
  The situation in the sphere of nature conservation [as 
published; possible misprint for "occupational safety"] is 
particularly inauspicious. Injuries are sustained in industry 
and agriculture annually by 400,000 workers, of whom 15,000 
become invalids, and 8,000 die. One out of every five working 
persons works under conditions that do not conform to 
sanitary-hygiene standards, which has led to a doubling of 
occupational illness in the past five years almost. 
  Thus the disregard for the social constituent of the process 
of reform of the economy has brought the nation to the brink of 
physical survival. We could present a long list of factors that 
have reduced the people to such a life. But ultimately they have 
all been brought about by the absence of a unified comprehensive 
social policy, which has made the latter a gratis and optional 
supplement to macroeconomics. 
  The social ministries work in an emergency first-aid mode 
and, lacking a concerted action program, distribute monetary 
resources to those who have become adept at lobbying in the 
corridors of power or who are able to loudly make their presence 
known. The miners began it, it was continued by the air-traffic 
controllers, teachers, and doctors. But there are also 
categories of working people which could hardly attract 
attention to themselves by shouting or strikes. Science, 
culture, and so forth are quietly becoming extinct. 
  Now, when the original shock following the proclamation of 
the election results has passed, there is no shortage of 
miraculous prescriptions of a painless reform of the economy, up 
to and including the resuscitation of state regulation (read: 
control). One of the best examples of this genre is, for 
example, the infamous report prepared by the Russian Academy of 
Sciences Economics Department. 
  The authors of the report proclaim a transition to a 
socially 
oriented market economy; we will leave the marketeers to judge 
the "marketness" of their proposals, but as regards the 
"socialness," things are not, to be blunt, that dazzling. In so 
bulky a report merely one paragraph each is devoted to such 
components of social policy as assurance of a subsistence 
minimum; housing reform; pensions and a "reinforcement" of the 
system of social allowances; food assistance for the 
particularly vulnerable categories; credit for young people; 
reorganization of the system of health care; preservation of the 
gratis nature of basic types of education; the fight against 
unemployment. The main defect of the report is the absence of 
specific mechanisms of a solution of these burning social 
problems; there are not even the most elementary calculations as 
to how much this would cost the treasury and the taxpayers, and 
the specific sources of funding are not indicated. Without such 
economic computation the above-mentioned measures will remain 
merely good intentions, and the road to hell is, as we all know, 
paved with these. 
  The proposal for the completion of the elevation of the 
minimum wage and social payments to the subsistence minimum no 
later than the first half of next year, 1995, sounds very 
beguiling, for example. Is this feasible, if it is considered 
that the minimum wage now constitutes 25 percent of the 
subsistence minimum. 
  The report points to the need for the government's 
establishment of some "socially permissible level of 
unemployment," but how is it to be measured? For Russia as a 
whole this is a "mean hospital temperature." Each city and each 
community have their own employment situation. Instead of 
armchair discussions of figures, would it not be better to 
concentrate on the elaboration of a program of a restructuring 
of employment, the creation of new jobs, and the development of 
a system of the training and retraining of personnel? The report 
makes absolutely no mention of such most important areas of 
social policy as incomes policy (the interlinkage of the various 
types thereof, the principles of fixed-income indexation, the 
formation of wages as the price of manpower, and so forth); 
formation of a labor market; the organization of targeted social 
protection; social partnership; the principles of the 
delineation of responsibility in the pursuit of social policy 
between the federal and local levels; stable financial support 
for social programs. 
  What, in our view, should the program minimum of social 
policy for the coming years represent? 
  It is necessary first and foremost to proceed from the fact 
that any state should guarantee such things as minimum wages and 
pensions and free generally accessible health-care services, 
education, and culture. An increase therein in line with the 
increase in economic possibilities would be guaranteed here 
also. But not directively but merely given objective signs of a 
real improvement in the situation. In 1994, for example, the 
minimum remuneration under all conditions will be maintained at 
the level of 50 percent of the subsistence minimum. This figure 
could be increased if against the background of a steady 
reduction in inflation to 5-7 percent a month an increase in 
real personal income were to begin. The next step could be taken 
when real income is restored to the level of the end of the 
1980's. 
  It has long been time to introduce into Russian practice 
such 
a concept as the "social budget." This means that the person in 
the government to whom responsibility for social policy is 
entrusted would have at his disposal a sizable part of the 
budget pie. As for how to divide it among the various 
areas--this would be the internal concern of the social bloc of 
the government. Supplementary to this it would be necessary to 
strictly defend the "social budget" itself against the 
military-industrial, agrarian, and other lobbies. 
  Closely linked with this is the question of how to 
distribute 
the "social budget" between the center and the regions. There 
would have to be precise mechanisms and agreements here, 
evidently. 
  The responsibility of the localities in the pursuit of 
social 
policy should be bolstered also by the communication of a 
uniform wage scale of an exclusively recommendatory nature. This 
would afford the regions an opportunity with regard to local 
specifics to allocate resources independently and with 
sufficient flexibility for unblocking bottlenecks from both a 
sectoral and intraregional angle. This selective influence on 
the sore points of the publicly funded sphere would make it 
possible to sharply enhance the efficiency of the use of funds 
for remuneration. 
  If we are speaking of an incomes policy as a whole, however, 
the regulatory role of the state should under present conditions 
shift primarily to the sphere of the taxation of personal 
income, being manifested in the rigorous, even repressive, 
withholding of the taxes specified by legislation and also in a 
temporary increase in the rate of taxation of high and 
super-high personal income. This would make it possible to 
replenish the revenue side of the budget and slow somewhat the 
property stratification processes. 
  The need for the creation of truly targeted social 
protection 
has long been urgent and overdue even. Its nucleus should be 
composed of personal work with everyone who appeals for 
assistance. If the applicant is able-bodied, work would be found 
for him, or he would be sent on courses to acquire a trade. For 
people with limited employment opportunities (women with small 
children, the handicapped) special jobs would be created. The 
beamed allocation of credit to families, young ones 
particularly, and the utmost encouragement of small-scale 
enterprise should be part of the arsenal of active means of 
social protection. 
  Those, on the other hand, who are incapable of catering for 
their well-being by their own labor must be paid--in a strict 
linkage with their material situation--allowances, 
compensation--and accorded privileges, free food, and so forth. 
A system of the ascertainment of and assistance to those who for 
objective reasons are not in a position to independently make 
their calamitous position known would be developed together with 
this. 
  The principles of the specificity of social protection are 
being introduced quite successfully in a number of Russian 
regions. A striking example are Voronezh and Nizhegorod Oblasts, 
where practically each needy family obtains entirely specific 
assistance from the local authorities. 
  In conclusion we would like to share our apprehensions about 
the fact that the real result of the castling which has occurred 
in the power structures since the elections could be not an 
improvement in Russians' material position but satisfaction of 
the political ambitions of numerous party leaders. Yet on 12 
December the electorate sent them an unambiguous message, which 
says that if the social sphere continues to be ignored by 
politicians, VVZh will be the second president of Russia. The 
results of the Federal Assembly elections should be seen as a 
first call, and the second call--general strikes and acts of 
civil disobedience--could be heard very soon and very menacingly.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Serp i Molot General Director </F>
Nikolay Izvekov by B. Dmitriyev under the rubric "Rumors"; place 
and date not given: "'Serp i Molot' Is Doing Fine"] 
  [Text] There are a lot of rumors everywhere. Including in 
Moscow. Just recently, for instance, it was said that one of the 
largest Moscow plants--Serp i Molot--is about to be shut down. 
Well, rumors they may be, but the workers became concerned: Are 
we being thrown out onto the street? It is not difficult to 
guess what panic may cause at an enterprise. Who benefits from 
inflaming the situation? MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent posed 
this question to Serp i Molot General Director Nikolay Izvekov. 
  "I have to disappoint the sensation lovers: Nothing terrible 
is happening at the plant," Nikolay Yakovlevich said. "On the 
contrary, after a certain decline in production, it is on the 
rise again. Although, of course, we have our share of problems. 
We had some unpleasant things happening before the plant 
stockholders' meeting. Somebody was spreading the most 
outrageous rumors that the enterprise had been sold to "third 
parties." In reality, outside companies, which are the source of 
the rumors, did attempt to buy a controlling share of Serp i 
Molot stock. For instance, ChIF [voucher investment fund] 
Partnerstvo purchased at preferential prices from plant 
employees about 15,000 shares and attempted to place their man 
on the board of directors. Fortunately, we managed to keep 
outside commercial operators from participating in running the 
metallurgical plant, where incompetent people are simply 
dangerous. Actually, I can tell you with certainty that 
Partnerstvo has little interest in our production. What attracts 
this firm is a different juicy morsel--huge commercial space 
that may be used as warehouses..." 
  According to Nikolay Izvekov, after unsuccessful attempts to 
place themselves on the plant joint-stock company's board of 
directors, the investment fund management began sowing panic 
among employees. In addition, clearly paid-for articles about 
the plant's unstable situation appeared in the "yellow" press. 
  "Right now we need to reassure the workers," continue 
Nikolay 
Yakovlevich. "Because there are no serious reasons for concern. 
We are working successfully, installing state-of-the-art 
technologies, and are not even considering selling any of the 
plant's property. And anyway, how could one of the plants most 
needed in the country be sold? If we stop production, the entire 
radio, automotive, and watch-making industry will immediately 
grind to a halt. Everybody needs high-quality steel, which is 
produced at only two or three enterprises in Russia." 
  Unfortunately a small part of the collective did fall for 
the 
temptation offered by commercial operators and sold their stock. 
However, in the opinion of the Serp i Molot management, the 
block of shares purchased by ChIF Partnerstvo is several times 
smaller than the controlling share. So there is no reason to 
worry. The metallurgical giant still belongs to the workers and 
produces the output we all need.

<F P=106> [Article by IZVESTIYA correspondent Sergey Zhdakayev: "Are </F>
State Enterprises Good for the State? Production Democracy's 
Hopes and Disappointments"] 
  [Text] Tula--Vladimir Dronov and Yuriy Tarasov came 
to be plant top managers through the same 
scenario--elections. 
  At the end of the 1980's, in the fashion of the times, the 
combine plant was electing a director. Yu. Tarasov, who by then 
was already the plant's acting general director, lost the 
election. The job went to V. Dronov, deputy director of a 
neighboring plant--an outsider, so to say. 
  Tarasov, however, survived the blow and a year later had his 
revanche at the Tula Railroad Machinery Plant, coming in ahead 
of seven contenders there. 
  Apparently, new ideas sound more convincing coming from a 
new 
person. Or perhaps it is true that no man is a prophet in his 
own land. 
  Now the era of production romanticism is becoming a thing of 
the past. Euphoria is being replaced by the rational, and 
emotions--by calculations. At recent stockholders meetings of 
the Tula Armory Plant [TOZ], for instance, the delegates 
expressed no-confidence in outsiders and rather unanimously 
voted for the old director, N. Maslennikov. 
  True, the results of the meeting are currently being 
challenged. Opponents contend that the law was violated. But 
this no longer incites previous passions. Commenting on these 
disputes, a local newspaper offers the conclusion that "the idea 
of elected management has exhausted itself. We have left this 
stage behind. And democracy does not apply here." 
  The paper also speaks rather skeptically of privatization, 
comparing it with collectivization. As to the stockholders 
meeting, it goes so far as to call it "a wake for the old TOZ." 
"Now it is a joint-stock company, which is doled out puny crumbs 
from the budget, and the collective must look for a way out on 
its own." 
  Does this mean that the longed-for economic independence has 
lost value in the eyes of the people and even has become a cause 
for condolences? 
<H5>  Ruble Equivalent of Freedom </H5>
  Generally speaking, the sad fate of a collective which "has 
to look for a way out on its own" does not evoke particular 
sympathy in the hardened hearts of the public. Therefore a trump 
card in the arguments against privatization is that it allegedly 
impoverishes the state, depriving it of its riches, the 
treasury--of revenue, and the people--of social protection. 
  This argument seemingly even is supported by the economic 
situation. The year 1994 began with delays in payments to 
budget-financed organizations. 
  But is privatization the culprit? In Yu. Tarasov's opinion 
the reverse is true. "When I came to Zheldormash [railroad 
machinery plant], the plant was nothing but a burden for the 
state, producing 11 million rubles [R] of output and not 
contributing a kopek to the treasury. Because there was only one 
type of tax then--profit tax. At the same time, it received R1 
million a year from the treasury in the form of subsidies. Since 
converting to joint-stock holding we have not received a kopek 
from the budget, while we paid more than R1.5 billion last year 
alone in the form of taxes. So I ask: Which is better for the 
state?" 
  It was exactly privatization, in Yu. Tarasov's opinion, that 
provided the plant with an incentive to modernize production. 
The Zheldormash put into production new track-repair machines, 
which the railroad industry has "accepted" and gladly buys, and 
opened a new furniture production facility, creating 300 new 
jobs in the process. A considerable part of the profit goes into 
expansion of production. In the environment of general decline, 
Zheldormash increased its output by 20 percent. It managed to 
allocate some money for social needs as well: It built a 
144-apartment house, purchased two buildings in a recreation 
facility on the Oka River, and built a heated stadium and soccer 
field. 
  Of course, the insolvency crisis is affecting Zheldormash, 
too, but not to such an extent as, for instance, the combine 
plant. 
<H5>  The Dead Grab the Living </H5>
  The 12,000-employee Tula Combine Plant [TKZ] was officially 
considered a flagship of national agricultural machine-building. 
Although strictly speaking it built not combines but headers. 
Combines were made at Rostselmash [Rostov Agricultural Machinery 
Plant], while the Tula flagship supplied header components for 
it. 
  At the beginning of the 1980's the TKZ, following Rostov's 
footsteps, began modernization, which cost (according to 
official data) R414 million (today the same figure would be 
expressed in billions). Tula was supposed to put into production 
headers for Don combines--90,000 units a year. 
  The plant was declared an all-Union shock-labor Komsomol 
[All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League] construction 
project. Eyewitnesses maintain that the entire oblast 
construction complex worked on the TKZ modernization project. 
Equipment was brought mostly from Japan and Germany, and 
additional workers from Ashkhabad ((Ashgabat)) and Tashkent. 
Venerable elders were brought in by plane from far and near 
mountain villages. 
  As the project neared completion, however, it came out that 
an error had found its way into the calculations of the 
modernization project's authors: The battle for the harvest did 
not need 90,000 headers--16,000 would be enough. 
  After modernization--which, by the way, was never 
completed--the plant was left with R45 million worth of unneeded 
Western equipment and special-use equipment for the production 
of wide-cut headers that cannot be modified. "Good-bye to 
people's money invested in modernization," the transformation 
plant newspaper KOMBAYNOSTROITEL in the beginning of 1990 summed 
up dejectedly. 
  The discovery was unsettling. New times were already 
knocking 
on the door, while the plant was firmly positioned to become a 
drain on the treasury. And since the treasury was getting 
increasingly emptier day by day, the plant, according to its 
newspaper, "kept beating on the door of its ministry begging for 
another handout." 
  Correctly appraising the situation, Dronov promised the 
collective "to rid ourselves of the demeaning role of 
Rostselmash appendage," to retrofit the plant for the production 
of profitable and prestigious goods, and gain economic 
independence. This earned him victory at the elections. 
  Some consider it a Pyhrric victory, though. Dronov did break 
out of Rostselmash's grip. Instead of harvesters, the plant is 
producing hitch-on combines, woodworking benches, electric 
motors, carts, and other apparently needed goods which were 
expected to ensure profits and hence economic independence. 
  So far, however, the expected profit--and independence with 
it--has proven elusive. The products are not selling well. Some 
because of the low purchasing capacity of agricultural 
consumers; others are not competitive; still others are not 
produced in enough quantity to generate real income. As a 
result, the plant today owes banks more than R7 billion, which 
is, in expert estimates, equal to almost 70 percent of the value 
of its property. Workers have not been paid for four months; the 
budget does not get any tax revenue. Unpaid liability amounts to 
R730 million. "In the current economic situation," admits 
Dronov, "we cannot do without credits." He means, of course, 
preferential credits, which strictly speaking are budget 
subsidies. At the end of last year the situation at the combine 
plant was discussed in the government. Dronov was promised R5 
billion, which he never got. "It is a paradox," said one of 
Dronov's colleagues commenting on the latter's request. "In the 
past everybody dreamed of economic independence; now they demand 
help from the state. But if you are independent, what right do 
you have to ask for it? The price of freedom is business 
activities, a new financial strategy, and perhaps even 
deprivation." 
<H5>  Does History Repeat Itself? </H5>
  The first stockholders meeting at the combine plant is 
scheduled for May. Dronov is facing elections again. Except that 
now the decisive vote will come mainly from buyers, not 
stockholders. This is the substance of true economic democracy. 
Voting by their hard-earned rubles, consumers have no mercy on 
failing producers. And the task of the meeting's participants is 
to register and carry out their will.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Kokorin, automated assembly line plant </F>
economist: "`Either There Isn't Enough Money, or Else Not Enough 
Sense . . .': Releasing Prices to Stimulate Production and Then 
Cutting Production to Ease Inflation Is Insanity, not Economic 
Policy, Says Plant Economist"] 
  [Text] The nonpayments crisis that has struck our 
economy is a Russian variation on the overproduction and market 
crisis characteristic for a market economy. Here, as in the 
general case, insufficient income and demand from the majority 
of the population lie at the base of the crisis. It was 
inevitable that our production would get into a market crisis, 
because the structure of our production was designed for a weak 
differentiation in incomes. As soon as that differentiation 
increased, as soon as the incomes of some increased and others 
decreased accordingly, then it was immediately obvious that some 
of output was not finding a market. 
  Large incomes are spent completely differently from small 
ones. And when some found themselves unable to buy furniture, 
clothing, and expensive foods, others found they needed real 
estate, Mercedes, and even private account in a foreign bank. 
  Demand has dropped in the mass market and increased in the 
elite market. If we had a closed economy, then the increase in 
demand for elite goods would lead to an increase in their 
production, thereby stimulating general economic growth. Imports 
got in the way, though. The new bourgeoisie, naturally, 
preferred higher quality foreign goods. On the other hand, the 
mass market was swamped by imported consumer goods and food, 
which exacerbated the market crisis for our own output that had 
already broken out. 
  The majority now cannot buy imported goods to the extent 
they 
used to buy their own. The former are not cheap enough to 
compensate for the population's declining purchasing power. 
Partially for this reason, imported consumer goods and foods 
enjoy a demand because the majority of the population has become 
so poor. Who, say, would prefer imported oil to our own Vologda 
oil if their income hadn't dropped? 
  It is not quality, however, but our poverty--this is mainly 
what has made imported consumer goods and food competitive. We 
are getting goods intended for third world countries, for 
nations that don't sneer at them. In the first quarter of this 
year alone, of the imported meat and sausage products inspected 
by the State Trade Inspectorate, nearly 60 percent were 
rejected, as were over 70 percent of the alcoholic beverages and 
more than 40 percent of the tea and coffee. 
  A piquant situation has come about. The poverty of the 
majority of the population has made it profitable to import 
cheap goods that have no demand abroad because of their low 
quality. The reverse is true as well: the huge incomes of a 
minority have made it profitable to import goods that do not 
enjoy great demand in the West, since they are too expensive. 
Whereas our output has proved less than competitive on the mass 
or the elite market. 
  The overproduction and market crisis is being aggravated by 
the sharp cut in what are socially absolutely essential state 
expenditures. The budget deficit is no testimony to the fact 
that they are too great. Unlike years past, the budget deficit 
today is the consequence of low state income. Not that long ago, 
the state comprised a powerful military-industrial complex and 
generously financed science and education, whereas today there 
is no money for anything. Naturally, the social product has been 
cut. But expenditures for defense, science, and education have 
been cut even more. The only item that has increased is the cost 
of maintaining the state apparatus. This latter, however, 
comprises a relatively small portion of total expenditures and 
do not affect the financial situation substantially. 
  The actual reasons for the budget deficit are well known: 
the 
loans to commercial banks at a negative interest rate, that is, 
for all intents and purposes, subsidies. This is the transfer 
into private hands of income from export-import operations; this 
is uncollected taxes from merchants and, naturally, the export 
of capital on an unprecedented scale. 
  The flourishing of trade and banking structures costs 
society 
dear. Maximally high taxes on producers does not help, and an 
extremely harsh financial policy with respect to production is 
not going to save the situation. 
  Financial policy in the sphere of turnover has turned out to 
be too soft. If the public funds that now go into trade and 
banking capital were to go into state income, we would now have 
the healthiest budget in the world--that is how mightily the 
country's population has been robbed in these years. 
  They are keep insisting on trying to convince us of the need 
to live within our means. This is a rather banal truth. In fact, 
however, we are being forced to live much worse than the funds 
available would allow, to spend on defense, science, education, 
and the rest much less than what society's cash resources make 
possible and what is absolutely essential for the satisfaction 
of society's needs. 
  The nonpayments crisis is going to continue to intensify 
until the demand for output is cut both on the part of the 
population and on the part of the state. This is what our 
radical reformers ought to have in mind if they really do intend 
to halt the decline in production. But are they aware of the 
scale and complexity of the task? 
  A monopolized economy has a long hard time coming out of a 
crisis. By way of illustration, one could cite the United 
States. In 1929, a crisis broke out, but there was no 
improvement until the very beginning of World War II. Whereas 
our market has been deformed to a greater degree than during 
America's Great Depression. 
  The government is preparing draft documentation for the 
introduction of a bill of exchange circulation. This is what the 
Finance Ministry sees as the final solution to the nonpayments 
problem. But who, one might ask, is going to honor a bill of 
exchange from our goods producers? The commercial banks? 
Possibly. But only on condition that the Central Bank is 
obligated to do a stock-taking of these bills of exchange. But 
this means inflationary financing, the emission of money not 
secured by goods. The bill of exchange is no salvation where the 
final solvent demand is limited and dropping. 
  In order to overcome this overproduction and market crisis, 
which is classic by its very nature, and which has been called 
the nonpayments crisis here, it is essential first of all to 
limit the differentiation in incomes, what is called in the West 
an incomes policy. 
  Think of F. Roosevelt. In a message to Congress in June 
1935, 
he proposed introducing a progressive tax on major wealth and 
corporate profits. Congress approved the bill. In the West, 
people realized long ago that excessive concentration of wealth 
at one pole and poverty at the other is the basis for economic 
crisis as well as social conflict. 
  Meanwhile, in our country, not only is no sensible incomes 
policy being carried out, on the contrary, here everything is 
being done for the fantastic enrichment of a minority and 
impoverishment of the majority. This does not exclude other 
causes for the nonpayments crisis. The government is constantly 
delaying the repayment of debts to agriculture and the fuel and 
defense industries and violating budgetary discipline for 
science, education, and culture. Meanwhile, all social and 
economic expenditures are being ascribed to the necessity of 
fighting inflation. 
  There is some logic in this behavior, of course. Our economy 
does not have any natural, internal barriers to inflation. This 
means inflation can be weakened only by relying on artificial 
barriers, which in the final analysis will always come down to 
saving money. 
  All this is correct, but unfortunately this is not an 
instance when the end justifies the means. Actually, that's not 
even so. What the government considers a goal (stable prices) in 
actuality is only a means, whereas the government looks on the 
actual goal (production) only as a means for stabilizing prices. 
Everything is confused in the Oblonskiy house! Releasing prices 
for the sake of stimulating production, and then cutting 
production in order to ease inflation, is insanity, not economic 
policy. 
  The problem is not at all a matter of preferring inflation 
or 
decline but in extricating ourselves from the idiotic situation 
in which we have to choose between inflation and decline. This 
requires the restoration of state control over prices. Under our 
specific conditions, however, this kind of control will be 
sufficiently effective only if control over the movement of 
goods is established simultaneously. Right now we do not know, 
generally speaking, at which line between a market economy and a 
planned economy we will be able to halt the decline in 
production. Nonetheless, we must act without delay. The 
nonpayments crisis is entering its final stage, threatening to 
paralyze all industry.

<F P=106> [Article by Ye. Temchin, under the rubric "Investments": </F>
"Where to Put Capital: In Snickers or Lathes?: Commercial 
Structures Offer Their Assistance to State Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Something seems to be starting to change in our sick 
economy: for the first time a group of major businessmen, at 
their own initiative, have approached Anatoliy Ogurtsov, 
chairman of Roskommash [RF Committee on Machinebuilding], with 
an offer to collaborate. It used to be just the opposite: 
Roskommash sought out partners among commercial structures. But 
didn't find any. It is more profitable to invest capital in 
Snickers than in lathes or turbines. There is practically no 
risk involved, and a speedy accumulation of capital is ensured. 
Machinebuilding is a long and risky affair. 
  Russia's machinebuilding complex finds itself in a very 
difficult position--mutual nonpayments, a lack of working 
capital, difficulties with the market and output, and so on. 
Last year mutual nonpayments and creditor indebtedness reached 
nearly 6 trillion rubles [R]. In January another more than R1 
trillion was racked up. Tractor and combine plants are standing 
idle; the collectives of our glorious auto giants have been put 
on forced leave; and our lathe builders and instrument makers 
are just barely working. 
  One of the instigators of the meeting with the 
industrialists, Aleksandr Yefanov, chairman of the board of 
directors of the Mikrodin AO (joint-stock company), stated that 
commercial structures possess sufficient capital to support 
financially several sites of the machinebuilding complex, but 
doing this will require above all strictly selecting, with the 
help of experts, pilot projects for potentially progressive 
output that is certain to be competitive and that will enjoy 
elevated demand on the domestic as well as the foreign market. 
"Mikrodin AO," he said, "is a happy exception. We have no 
problems with marketing our output or with nonpayments." He 
explained that it is just a matter of the system he put 
together: NIOKR [scientific research and experimental design 
work]--financial organization--marketing. These are the three 
whales on which the Mikrodin association rests. First an 
interesting and promising project, then a study of its marketing 
possibilities, and, after that, its financing. The main 
misfortune of many enterprises is that they do not use this kind 
of system, or in any event they lack the two most important 
links in the chain--marketing and financing. Abroad, banks work 
with industry in the closest possible way. This has not been set 
up here. 
  One person who spoke in the wake of the industrialists said 
that work in this direction is our last hope. Someone else added 
that this meeting between financiers and industrialists could 
become a historic turning point in machinebuilding. In short, 
fine words were spoken at this conference, hopeful words. 
  But I sat there and listened and thought that many fine and 
hopeful words had been spoken in recent years, but the reality 
is much worse. Tens of plants have come to a complete 
standstill, hundreds are working three or four days a 
week--there is no money even for salaries. The reasons for this 
misfortune are well understood by everyone, and there are plenty 
of plans for getting out of this labyrinth, but just which of 
them will lead us out into the bright market future? We are 
drowning in macroprograms, of which we are periodically 
informed, but how do are they going to be carried out on the 
microlevel? What specific plans are there on this score? 
  Anatoliy Ogurtsov, Roskommash's chairman, told me that a few 
days ago the leaders of the industrial committees, famous 
academicians, and representatives of bankings structures had 
gathered and discussed how to get out of the present impasse, 
and they never did come to a unanimous opinion. Each group has 
its own macroprogram, each of which contains good ideas, but 
they mesh badly. At Roskommash they made an attempt to 
synthesize them. A working group of 11 highly experienced 
financial analysts was created. They got hold of "outsider" 
programs (although this is not always easy; we have retained the 
old habit of not showing "outsiders" our "secrets"), subjected 
these programs to painstaking analysis, selected the most 
far-sighted elements, and added their own. 
  At the meeting between the machinebuilders and the "sharks" 
of capital, several contradictions were noted in the goals of 
industrialists and financiers. Most important to the former, in 
order for such giants as ChTZ [Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant], 
Rostselmash, and others like them to take up work again, was 
that their investment return workers and engineers from their 
forced leave. The other side was interested in something else. 
The president of the inter-branch commercial Resurs Bank, Semen 
Epshteyn, said sternly that bankers were acting in this instance 
not as altruists or as patrons, but were guided above all by the 
desire to defend our market against foreign intervention. And 
there is only one way to do that: by investing in pilot 
projects. But these have to be selected very carefully, not only 
for their technical characteristics but also for their marketing 
possibilities as well. Banks are not going to invest capital in 
something that the market doesn't demand and that will not yield 
a definite profit. 
  In his opinion, it makes no sense to invest capital now in a 
tractor or combine giant, because their current mass output is 
not in demand in the market. All you can do here is get bogged 
down and go bankrupt. It would be another matter if there were 
new developments that were promising from a marketing aspect. In 
that case there would be food for thought. 
  After the second meeting, Roskommash created in quick order 
its own expert commissions, which must choose what they think 
are the most promising projects. 
  These will be subjected to expert banking analysis, and then 
they will see. 
  The fact itself is important. For the first time in the 
years 
of economic reforms, commercial structures have turned away from 
Snickers and toward machinebuilding, which never yields quick or 
large dividends anywhere in the world but does ensure the 
prosperity of all other branches. 
  This meeting of young native capital and our old 
machinebuilding may set off a saving spark. We will have to wait 
a month. That was the deadline set.

<H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>
  Over the period 29 March to 5 April 1994 prices for consumer 
goods and services rose by 2.2 percent, including for 
foodstuffs--by 1.4 percent, nonfood items--by 1.9 percent, 
and for-fee services for the population--by 11.9 percent. 
The highest rate of increases in prices for goods was registered 
in cities of the East Siberian economic region, and for for-fee 
services for the population--in the cities of Northwestern, West 
Siberian, and Far Eastern regions. 
  Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in the 
consumer market were as follows (as a percentage of the 
preceding observation date): 


                 03/22       03/29       04/05       Average daily price

<H5>  Foodstuffs. </H5>
  Over the period 29 March to 5 April prices in organized and 
nonorganized trade rose by 1.5 percent and 1.3 percent. 
  Price changes by main categories of food products are shown 
below (as a percentage of the preceding observation date): 


                     Total           Including:

vegetables 


  In organized trade, similar to the preceding 
month, vegetable prices rose at an anticipatory rate: onions--by 
14 percent, fresh cabbage--by 11 percent, and carrots--by 7 
percent. A high rate of price increases remained with respect to 
bread and bakery products (5-7.5 percent). A higher rate of 
price increases than in March was registered with respect to 
milk products (2.7-5 percent). There was practically no change 
over the week in prices for meat, butter, vegetable oil, sugar, 
eggs, and vodka. 
  Similar to organized trade, the greatest price increases 
in nonorganized trade were registered with respect to 
fresh produce: prices for onions went up by 11 percent, fresh 
cabbage--by 6 percent, and garlic--by 5 percent. The rate of 
prices rises with respect to meat increased somewhat as compared 
to March (1.4 percent). Prices for milk products remained 
practically unchanged. 
  The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic 
foodstuffs increased over the week by 2.7 percent and as of 
5 April amounted to 45,500 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly 
basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured 
a factor of 4.0; the highest cost was registered in Magadan 
(R122,400) and the lowest--in Ulyanovsk (R27,800). In terms of 
the cost of the consumer basket, St. Petersburg and Moscow 
ranked 33th and 37th among 132 monitored cities (R49,700 and 
R49,100 on a monthly basis). 
<H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>
  As in March, prices for nonfood items rose at a somewhat 
higher rate. Prices for some medicines continued to rise at a 
high rate--10 percent. Prices for garments, knitwear, and 
footwear rose over the week by 1.7-2 percent. 
<H5>  For-Fee Services for the Population </H5>
  At the beginning of April rates of for-fee services for the 
population increased considerably. Apartment rents in Russia on 
average rose 23.9 percent; the cost of urban and rail 
transportation--15-19 percent, and that of basic residential 
telephone service--12-17 percent. 
  Rents in municipally owned residential buildings in St. 
Petersburg, Vladimir, Saransk, Kurgan, Blagoveshchensk, and 
cities in Tatarstan increased several-fold. In Surgut they 
jumped from R100 to R255 per square meter. The cost of municipal 
services also went up considerably in these cities. 
  Urban bus fares in Belgorod, Maykop, Khabarovsk, 
Komsomolsk-na-Amure, and Samara increased by a factor of 2.5 to 
five; rail transportation fares in Orel, Yaroslavl, Saransk, 
Rostov-na-Donu, and Stavropol--by a factor of two to 2.5. 
  While fees for attending preschool facilities increased in 
Russia as a whole on average by 13.8 percent over the week, in 
Tyumen, Surgut, and Maykop they increased more than twofold, and 
in Voronezh--fourfold. 
<H5>  Wholesale Prices for Industrial Products </H5>
  The index of wholesale prices for industrial 
products was lower in March than in February, and measured 
110 percent. Over three months of this year (as compared to 
December 1993) prices increased 1.5-fold. 
  In practically all industrial sectors (with the exception of 
electric power generation, nonferrous metallurgy, and chemistry) 
prices rose at a slower pace than in February of this year. 
Prices rose slower with respect to fuel industry products. Oil 
prices increased over the month by 15 percent, petroleum 
products--by 6 percent, and coal--by 8 percent. At the end of 
March the average price of coal in the main coal-producing 
regions--Kemerovo and Rostov Oblasts--amounted to R16,000-18,000 
per tonne, and in Republic of Komi--R22,000 per tonne; oil in 
Tyumen Oblast--R65,000. Producer wholesale price of gas amounted 
to R5,400 per 1,000 cubic meters, gasoline--R148,000, and diesel 
fuel--R136,000 per tonne. Overall over the first quarter, fuel 
industry wholesale prices increased 1.7-fold. 
  Higher prices for fuel and products of their processing 
continued to affect the cost of electric power. By the end of 
the quarter electric power rates as compared to December 1993 
increased 1.6-fold and amounted on average for all categories of 
consumers to about R29 per kw-hour. The main increases in 
electric power rates in March occurred with respect to electric 
power delivered to industrial consumers and municipal 
services--by more than 20 percent. 
  As during the preceding two months, wholesale prices for 
consumer goods rose at a slower rate than those for producer 
goods, and amounted on average to 9 percent. Wholesale prices of 
milk and meat products increased over the month by 7-9 percent. 
Over the quarter, prices in bread-baking, butter-making, 
cheese-making, and milk industry rose by a factor of 1.5-1.6. 
  Freight rates at all types of transportation increased by 8 
percent in March of this year, including by rail--by 21 percent, 
pipeline--by 11.5 percent, and automotive--by 7.5 percent. Air 
freight rates remained practically unchanged. 
  As compared to December 1993, freight rates increased 
1.8-fold, including rail transport--by 79 percent, pipeline--by 
75 percent, and automotive--by 73 percent. 
<H5>  Industry </H5>
  In the first quarter of this year Russian industry produced 
R55 trillion worth of goods in current prices, including in 
March--R21 trillion worth. The physical volume of 
production declined by 24.9 percent as compared to the 
first quarter of last year (in the first quarter of 1993 
production declined as compared to the analogous period of 1992 
by 19.3 percent), including by 23.1 percent in January, 24.1 
percent in February, and 27.4 percent in March. 
  During the first quarter it became clear that the production 
decline is predominantly of a structural nature. This manifested 
itself in the fact that the volume of production became 
increasingly predicated more on solvent demand than on resource 
potential. As a result, the degree of any particular sector's 
reaction to the emerging market situation varied. While gas 
production remained practically at last year's level, sectors in 
the fuel and energy complex reduced production of oil and coal 
by 9-15 percent. At the same time the output of many basic 
categories of machine-building products and a number of light 
industry goods dropped almost by half; chemical industry 
output--by 25-30 percent, and that of ferrous metallurgy--by 
20-35 percent. Production of basic categories of foodstuffs 
declined by 10-20 percent. 
  Over January-March 1994, of 406 most important categories of 
products counted in periodic reports, average daily production, 
as compared to January-March of 1993: 
  --increased with respect to 26 items, (including 
foundry machines, machines used in municipal services, 
production lines and automated systems for measuring and 
packaging dry foods, dough-making components and machines, cash 
registers, apathite concentrate, cinematographic and photo film, 
polyvynilchloride resin, freezers, cotton fabrics, cooking salt, 
high fat-content cheeses and feta cheese, and mayonnaise), or 6 
percent of the total number; 
  --decreased with respect to 373 items, or 92 
percent of the total number. With respect to 281 items (69 
percent of the total number), production declined by one-quarter 
or more; among them are lubricant oils, sheet rolled metal, 
high-grade cold-rolled steel, metal cord, fire-resistant items, 
low-power electric motors, light bulbs, mine electric carts, 
self-propelled tower cranes, elevators, freight and passenger 
rail cars, chemical fiber and thread, protein fodder additive, 
phosphate and nitrogen fertilizer, commercial wood, lumber, 
marches, cement, roof slate, construction brick, gypsum, 
asbestos, sewing and washing machines, photo cameras, woolen and 
silk fabrics, outer knitwear, footwear, lump sugar, macaroni 
items, canned fish and meat, cereals, vodka, and hard liquor. 
  Over the elapsed period there was no production of computer 
control systems, coal-cutters, yard and industrial diesel 
locomotives, scrapers, self-propelled mower-crushers, grain 
loaders, and flax-harvesting combines. 
  By the end of the quarter, stoppages at individual 
production facilities had occurred at almost 5,000 enterprises. 
And while at the beginning of last year the prevailing cause of 
stoppages were shortages of input materials, components, and 
fuel, in the first quarter of this year the main cause of 
enterprise stoppages were difficulties in selling output (more 
than 60 percent of all losses). 
  In a number of sectors distribution difficulties were the 
result of lack of consumer demand stemming from a decline in 
public need for the output produced (conversion); in others, 
first and foremost those serving the consumer goods 
sector--reorientation of solvent demand toward more competitive 
imported goods. 
  In the fuel and power generation sectors in 
January-March of this year extraction (production) of the main 
varieties of energy resources continued to decline. Overall, 
75.7 million tonnes of oil, including gas condensate, were 
produced over the quarter (85 percent as compared to the first 
quarter of 1993), 76.3 million tonnes (91 percent), and 165 
billion cubic meters of gas (99.2 percent); electric power 
generation declined by 4 percent as compared to the first 
quarter of last year. 
  In ferrous metallurgy, in January-March of the 
year, as compared to the corresponding period of last year, 
production lagged with respect to pig iron smelting--20 percent, 
steel--26 percent, production of finished rolled metal--24 
percent, and steel pipe--48 percent. 
  In machine building, in the first quarter of this 
year with respect to almost half the items counted in periodic 
reports output amounted to 40 percent or less of the level of 
the first quarter of last year. Production of large electric 
machinery over the elapsed quarter as compared to the first 
quarter of 1993 declined by 46 percent, metal-cutting machine 
tools--by 50 percent, forge presses--by 68 percent, freight 
cars--by 62 percent, trolley buses--by 52 percent, and passenger 
cars--by 31 percent; production of electric travelling cranes 
and self-propelled cranes declined by almost two thirds, of 
bulldozers--almost by half, and production of scrapers was 
suspended altogether. 
  In the chemical and petrochemical industry, 
overall during the quarter output of the main raw material 
products--synthetic ammonia, sulfuric acid, and caustic 
soda--amounted to 72-79 percent of the level of last year's 
first quarter, and of calcinated soda--51 percent. Mineral 
fertilizer production dropped by 28 percent as compared to first 
quarter of 1993; chemical thread and fiber--by 53 percent; and 
automotive tires--by 44 percent. 
  In the chemical-pharmaceutical industry, 
production of ampicillin amounted to a little more than 
one-third on that of January-March of last year; validol and 
levomicitin--about one-half, and euphillin--two-thirds. At the 
same time, production of analgine, papaverine, and 
nitroglycerine increased as compared to the first quarter of 
1993. 
  In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper 
industry in January-March of this year, as compared to the 
corresponding period of last year the take-out volume of timber, 
including round timber, declined by almost one-third, which led 
to a decline in the production of lumber by 30 percent; the 
output of commercial cellulose dropped by 34 percent, paper--by 
26 percent, and cardboard--by 39 percent. Production of 
effective substitutes for commercial wood, in particular, 
cement-chip panels and technical wood chips for the production 
of cellulose and wood pulp declined over the indicated period by 
41-51 percent; of hardwood-fiber board and packaging 
cardboard--by one-third, and wood-chip board--by 23 percent. 
  In the construction materials industry over the 
first quarter of this year as compared to the corresponding 
period of last year the output of cement declined by 35 percent, 
soft roofing and insulation materials--by 44 percent; brick--by 
26 percent; window glass--by 41 percent; wall materials, 
prefabricated ferro-concrete, construction and technical lime, 
and porous fillers--by 29-34 percent; and high-grade asbestos 
and mineral cotton--by 50-55 percent. Production of home 
appliances and fixtures--heating radiators and convectors, gas 
stoves, and bath tubs--declined by 36-52 percent. 
  In light industry in the first quarter, as compared to the 
first quarter of last year, output of fabrics declined by 19 
percent, hosiery and knitwear--by 28 percent, and footwear--by 
55 percent. 
  There was a considerable decline in the production of most 
items in the garment industry: coats, short coats, and 
skirts--by 61-68 percent, light coats and jackets--by 53-58 
percent, and slacks and suits--by 41-42 percent. 
  In the production of complex home appliances in 
January-March 
of this year as compared to the same period of last year there 
was an increase in the output of freezers, two- and 
three-chamber refrigerators, and digital laser disk players. 
Output of the most important items for cultural and household 
use declined: washing machines--by 43 percent, tape 
recorders--by 60 percent, television sets--by 24 percent, and 
porcelain, stoneware, and majolica tableware and kitchenware--by 
19 percent. 
  Over the elapsed period of the year there was a drop in 
production of goods for small farms, house-adjacent plots and 
gardens: engines and motorized cultivators--by 10 percent, and 
mini-tractors--by more than one-quarter. 
  Among food items, in the first quarter of 1994, as 
compared to the corresponding period of last year, there was an 
increase in the output of high fat-content cheeses and feta 
cheese, as well as mayonnaise. 
  Production of most foodstuffs declined as compared to the 
first quarter of 1993: meat--by 25 percent, whole-milk 
products--by 17 percent, butter--by 33 percent, vegetable 
oil--by 11 percent, flour--by 16 percent, and cereals--by 35 
percent. 
  There was a considerable drop as compared with January-March 
of last year in the production of confectionery and macaroni 
items, canned meat, starch, and baker's yeast (by 22-39 
percent), lump sugar and food concentrates (by 56 percent and 47 
percent, respectively). The output of bread and bakery items 
dropped by 14 percent. 
  Production of vodka and hard liquor amounted to half of that 
for the first quarter of 1993, including 57 percent in March. 
<H5>  The Agro-Industrial Complex </H5>
  Farms in the southern regions of Russia began sowing early 
spring crops. According to reports from localities, because of 
the long spring and heavy spring high-waters, the sowing 
campaign in a number of territories began approximately two 
weeks later than last year. 
  Readying equipment for operation is proceeding 
more slowly than preceding years. At this point almost one-fifth 
of tractors, soil-tilling equipment, and seeders are still 
awaiting repair at Russian farms. 
  Industrial and distribution organizations have shipped 
mineral fertilizer and fuel for agricultural needs in the 
following volumes (millions of tonnes):

  The decline in shipped quantities of indicated material 
resources was a result of lower production volume, as well as 
poor solvency of agricultural consumers. As compared to the 
corresponding period of last year, purchases in January-March of 
this year dropped by more than half. As farms received credit 
for the conduct of the spring sowing campaign, shipments of fuel 
for agricultural needs increased over the past month as compared 
to the preceding one by 19-21 percent. 
  Agricultural enterprises have been buying fuel and 
lubricants 
more actively lately. In March of this year farm petroleum 
products warehouses received 58 percent more diesel fuel and 44 
percent more gasoline than in February. At the same time the 
volume of petroleum products purchased by enterprises as a whole 
over the first quarter was lower than that of preceding years.

<H5>  Animal Husbandry </H5>
  In the first quarter of this year, as compared to the 
analogous period of 1993, the volume of livestock and poultry 
sold for slaughter by farms of all categories declined by an 
estimated 13 percent, production of milk--by 9 percent, and 
eggs--by 6 percent. At agricultural farms, which are the main 
producers of animal husbandry products, the volume of production 
of meat and milk declined by 15-18 percent, and eggs--by 6 
percent. Production of animal husbandry products at personal 
plots remained at the same level as the corresponding period of 
last year. 
  A decline in the animal herd is taking place mainly at 
agricultural enterprises where the rate of herd reduction with 
respect to horned cattle and swine amounted to 11-13 percent, 
cows--6-7 percent, and sheep and goats--22-23 percent. 
Remainders of fodder per standard head of cattle amounted at 
these farms by the beginning of April of this year on average to 
6 quintals of feed units, as compared to 5.3 quintals of feed 
units by this time last year. 
  In the first quarter of this year procurement organizations 
purchased for state stocks from all producers 28 percent less 
livestock and poultry, 21 percent less milk, and 6 percent fewer 
eggs than during the same period last year. At the same time, 
agricultural enterprises increased sales of animal husbandry 
products at farmers markets, through their own trade network, 
the public catering system, and other channels. 
<H5>  Sales of Fresh Produce </H5>
  By 28 March of this year agricultural enterprises sold 
through all distribution channels 17,500 tonnes of greenhouse 
vegetables (24,200 tonnes in 1992). They sold 12,800 tonnes of 
such products to procurement organizations (73 percent of the 
total volume), which is one-third less than last year.

  Sales of these products through other channels increased. 
Since the beginning of the year 4,700 tonnes of greenhouse 
produce (27 percent of the total volume of sales), as compared 
to 4,200 tonnes (18 percent) last year, were sold through 
farmers markets, their own trade enterprises, and the public 
catering system. 
  The greatest decline in procurement of greenhouse produce 
(three- to fourfold) occurred in Tambov, Penza, and Samara 
Oblasts. Procurement of greenhouse produce at the farms in 
Belgorod Oblast and Mordvinia amounted to only 4-12 percent of 
last year's level. 
<H5>  Standard of Living </H5>
  The monetary income of the population over the 
first quarter amounted to R53 trillion and was nine times 
greater than in the first quarter of 1993. The share of the 
payroll fund in the total volume of monetary income declined 
from 65 percent in the first quarter of 1993 to 59 percent in 
the first quarter of 1994. 
  The population's disposable income (income less mandatory 
payments) increased by about 10 percent after factoring in the 
consumer price index. 
  Distribution of the Russian Federation population by per 
capita income was as follows:

  Calculations show that the rate of growth of nominal income 
in the high-income group is twice as high as the analogous 
indicator within the low-income group. 
  In the first quarter of 1994 the average wages 
earned by workers increased 7.5-fold as compared to the first 
quarter of 1993. The estimated average wage in March amounted to 
R160,000 and increased 6.8-fold as compared to March 1993. Real 
average monthly wages calculated after factoring in the consumer 
price index declined in the first quarter of 1994 by 4 percent 
as compared to the first quarter of 1993, and in March 1994 as 
compared to March 1993--by 3 percent. 
<H5>  Employment </H5>
  The total economically active population in March 1994 
numbered about 75 million, or 50 percent of the country's total 
population. Of them, 70.5 million persons were engaged in all 
categories of economic activities and 4.4 million persons were 
not engaged but actively searching and in keeping with ILO 
methodology were classified as unemployed. Taking into account 
those working part-time, total unemployment potential amounted 
to 8.8 million persons, or 11.7 percent of the economically 
active population. One million persons, or 1.3 percent of the 
total economically active population, were officially designated 
as unemployed by organs of the state employment service.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Sosin, director of the Scientific Research </F>
Center of Problems of Economics and Management: "The Practice of 
Economic Reform. Unusual Thoughtlessness"] 
  [Text] Kemerovo--The popular thesis about "shifting 
the center of gravity of the reforms to the localities" is 
erroneous--thinks the author of the article published below. 
Only the Government of the Russian Federation is capable of 
bringing the coal, metallurgical, chemical, and machine-building 
regional complexes out of the crisis. And it must not take its 
hands off the wheel. 
<H5>  The Monopoly is Immortal. Long Live the Monopoly! </H5>
  I must say that no document developed by the president's 
administration, signed, and, moreover, read by B. Yeltsin, has 
evoked such authentic interest among specialists as the first 
Message of the president of the Russian Federation to the 
Federal Assembly, "On Strengthening Russian Statehood." The 
document can be viewed in various ways. But there is no doubt 
about one thing: The Message clearly brought Ye. Gaydar's 
economic experiments to an end. 
  In his message the president stated that "1994 must be the 
year of the formation of Russian financial-industrial groups. 
The government must make sure that they are created strictly on 
a voluntary basis and prevent the revival of old ministerial 
structures, illegal appropriation of state property, and 
unjustified monopolism." 
  The creation of corporations has proved to be viable 
throughout the entire 20th century. But, as analysis shows, the 
potential capabilities of financial-industrial groups (FPG) 
could remain unrealized if their creation turns into a regular 
campaign and they themselves are regarded as a panacea for all 
economic problems. 
  Is the alarm justified? Unfortunately, yes. And here is a 
concrete confirmation of this. The administration of Kemerovo 
Oblast, based on the key points of the Edict of the President of 
the Russian Federation No. 2096 of 5 December 1993 "On the 
Creation of Financial-Industrial Groups in the Russian 
Federation," began to work actively on forming the 
financial-industrial group Kuzbass Company. According to the 
intention of the authors of its concept, it "is being created 
for fuller utilization of scientific-technical and production 
potential of the Kemerovo production-territorial complex." As 
you can see, in Kuzbass they are trying to rely on the edict to 
create not an interbranch structure but a regional one which 
would function like the old Sovnarkhoz [Soviet of the National 
Economy]. 
  But, God help them, with "local" problems. Here, as analysis 
shows, we are speaking about something altogether different: the 
creation of a real monopolistic monster which could cause 
serious harm both to the region and to Russia as a whole. The 
administration intends to solve the oblast's economic problems, 
among other things, "through cartel agreements of participants 
in the financial-industrial group...." It is in this connection 
that I fully share the viewpoint of Ye. Salnikova, deputy chief 
of the Main Administration for the Development of Competition of 
the State Committee of the Russian Federation for Antimonopoly 
Policy and Support of New Economic Structures: "The most 
dangerous thing for market relations are agreements in the form 
of financial-industrial groups among competitors--enterprises 
operating on the market for the same commodity." How does one 
avoid this? 
<H5>  We Can Save Ourselves Only Together, in the Same Boat </H5>
  Speaking at a conference of leaders of coal enterprises and 
associations of the Kuzbass, oblast Governor M. Kislyuk said 
that: "We need financial-production groups, since it has long 
been clear that rescuing the drowning is the problem of the 
drowning themselves. No Moscow and no ministry will help us." 
  With all due respect to the governor, I think Kislyuk's 
statement is profoundly erroneous and very rash. 
  What is the most alarming thing? The key circumstance for 
the 
Kuzbass is that saving the oblast economy is far from an oblast 
problem since we cannot overcome our adversities within the 
framework of the Kuzbass alone. Why? Because these problems are 
too great and the price of solving them is very high...let us 
think about it. 
  If we tried to rely only on our own investment resources and 
organizational efforts, we would not be able to complete the 
structural rearrangement of the oblast national economy or 
perhaps even just the fuel complex by the end of the 21st 
century. The essence of the problem, in my opinion, is this. 
According to figures from oblast statistics, by 1 July 1992 the 
fixed capital of the oblast national economy (before it was 
reappraised) was estimated at 49.1 billion rubles [R] in 1984 
prices. Of this amount, R39.3 billion was in fixed production 
capital. So if we set for ourselves just a partial task and 
began structural rearrangement only of the sphere of material 
production and the production infrastructure, we would have to 
invest, depending on the branch, R3.5 and sometimes even R10 in 
capital investments for each ruble of fixed production capital. 
  Our calculations show that just high-quality transformation 
of worn-out fixed production capital will take from R25.0 
billion to R41.0 billion in capital investments in 1984 prices. 
As for agriculture, which produces approximately 38 percent of 
the social norm of grain, it could collapse completely if 
financial aid is not rendered to it from the federal budget. 
  So are we at an impasse? The problem, it seems, can be 
resolved only on the basis of combined efforts: federal, 
interregional, intraregional, branch, and production. For no 
matter what anyone says, the Kuzbass with all of its factors is 
only a particle of immense Russia. Its key branch--coal--will be 
subsidized from the federal budget in the future as well. 
Therefore there will be no "economic gallop." 
  We will be forced to pass through such stages as: 
stabilization, which will occupy the years 1994-1996; 
restoration; structural, and, finally, market. Conducting the 
basic economic reforms will probably take from 25 to 30 years. 
And this is in the best case, with a satisfactory solution to 
the most difficult economic problems and mandatory provision of 
the necessary investment resources. But in all probability the 
emergence of the Kuzbass from its structural and ecological 
crisis will last up until the middle of the 21st century. 
  Here a great deal can be resolved through a well-considered 
and weighed regional economic policy, strategy, and selected 
priorities. We will probably not be able to reach the key 
indicators of the United States, Japan, and Western Europe until 
the end of the 21st century. The historic disparity is too great. 
<H5>  What Can the Oblast Administration Do? </H5>
  And so the problems are legion. Who should work on them? 
Within the framework of the oblast, who is responsible for 
leading the process of economic reform? The answer to this is 
simple: Of course, it is the oblast administration. But, as the 
situation shows, its economic role is decreasing and in all 
probability it will decrease even more. The reason for this 
phenomenon is fairly commonplace. Everyone who is very familiar 
with modern history recalls that before 1929 in the United 
States the majority of economic functions were under the 
jurisdiction of the states. But the crisis of 1929-1932 
demonstrated the inability of the states and local authorities 
to handle socioeconomic problems alone, which brought about 
strengthening of federal power within the framework of F. 
Roosevelt's "New Deal." 
  Therefore, drawing historical analogies, I can say with a 
fair amount of certainty that the thesis: "The center of gravity 
of the reforms must shift to the regions," if speaking about 
branches of specialization, will not stand up even under the 
slightest criticism since one can see nothing here but good 
intentions and wishes. In this case I have in mind investment 
resources. It is in this connection that the federal government, 
relying on the region's administration, must take over the main 
functions for bringing the coal, metallurgical, chemical, 
machine building, and other regional complexes out of the crisis 
and also provide a federal production infrastructure. 
  And agriculture should be under the direct jurisdiction of 
local administrations; this pertains to the intraregional 
production and social infrastructure. After a couple of years 
when the administration begins to be restored and return to its 
initial condition, when its quantitative and qualitative growth 
begins, when normal tax mechanisms are created--then, I agree, 
it will be possible to begin a stage-by-stage increase in the 
role of regional administrations in solving economic problems. 
At the same time this would be based on interaction between 
federal and regional legislation. But today.... 
  In my view, it is necessary, in the first place, to develop 
a 
full-scale "general plan for management of the oblast national 
economy," which is capable of functioning in a market 
environment; second, to create as a part of the oblast 
administration a "Committee on Coordination of Economic Activity 
and Organization of Cooperative-Economic Ties in the National 
Economy of Kemerovo Oblast." 
  In general I think that the oblast administration, while not 
a market subject, can do a great deal for its reliable 
functioning--through the creation and priority support of 
corporations (financial-production groups), associations, and 
private and joint enterprises.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Leytland, chairman of the economics </F>
committee of the Democratic Party of Russia, by Valeriy Badov; 
place and date not given: "With the Introduction of Big-Time 
Radicals the Russian Economy Began To Thunder Down the Hill"] 
  [Text] "All of Russia will long remember Ye. Gaydar: 
because only 50 percent of the 1990 economic potential remained 
intact there. It is necessary to change priorities and period 
keep key sectors of industry under government jurisdiction 
during the transition," 
  --thinks the chairman of the economics committee of the 
Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Leytland. Our correspondent 
speaks with him. 
  [Badov] In everyday terms the evaluation of the crisis 
differs depending on the position of the person doing the 
evaluating--who has been burned and who has kept warm. In this 
sense, as far as I know, your view of the economic barometer is 
"three dimensional"--as an industrialist in the post of 
president of the Siberian Highway Corporation, a banker as the 
representative of the board of the Narkombank, and as a 
politician who heads up the economics committee of the 
Democratic Party of Russia. 
  [Leytland] No matter which side you look from, there is 
nothing to make you feel better. The "Chicago model" turned out 
to be utter quack medicine for our sick economy and it must be 
replaced before it is too late. 
  [Badov] Many see the defeat of the Gaydar bloc as a sign of 
public rejection of the monetarist model of reform. Since 
Gaydar's resignation, those who took his rhetoric at face value 
are grieving over the notion that Russia is about to be knocked 
off the bright path of economic liberalism. And right at a time 
when the most unfavorable, "shock" part of the reform is behind 
us. But the economic program of the Democratic Party of Russia, 
in which you along with Glazyev and Bogomolov also had a hand, 
not only denies the correctness of the path chosen by Gaydar and 
his followers in government but also raises doubts about whether 
these reforms were actually liberal in nature: "Today instead of 
a market with free competition, a semi-feudal market is being 
formed." Is this not a polemical exaggeration? 
  [Leytland] I do not see any exaggeration. During the course 
of what was called liberal reform the mechanisms the suppress 
competition became even stronger. While in terms of degree of 
"liberalization" of the economy we outdid developed capitalist 
countries. What kind of paradox is this? But the dirty trick is 
that this present "free will"--freedom from state 
regulation--has been absurdly "augmented" with freedom from 
responsibility for the means and results of economic activity. 
And the first victims of these economic machinations were the 
consumers and small enterprises. An oligarchy is appearing which 
is suppressing competition and advancing the interests of 
society, which include the demand for efficiency. Incentives for 
productive activity are simply disappearing. 
  [Badov] The old bureaucratic command system tied the hands 
of 
people with entrepreneurial inclinations but it was unable to 
close its eyes to their self-will. The imperative for economic 
growth held sway over bureaucrats from the Gosplan [State 
Planning Commission] and also local party bosses. One gets the 
impression that the present authorities have no such imperative. 
  [Leytland] Perhaps not. Two years of life according to a 
monetarist calendar have led to a degradation of the economy 
that it would have been difficult to imagine. We industrialists 
and entrepreneurs, who in words have been given our "freedom," 
have ended up in traps stronger than those of the nomenklatura-- 
financial and doctrinaire ones, but with the opposite sign. 
Remember the discussions of Bukharin and Larin from 1918 and 
their furious attack on "bourgeois" commodity production. It is 
as though this historical scene has returned again: There is the 
same restraint and "righteousness," but with a switching of the 
poles. And the same indifference to the price they pay to get 
what they want. They have thrown the works of the Putilovs and 
Ryabushkins on the bonfire--the potential of the second largest 
economy in the world. 
  We had ruined everything with our reforms when the national 
economy began to go on the auction block and the best capital 
and resources were being used to pay for debts and forfeitures. 
Does the fact that foreign investors have actually invested a 
paltry $180 million in Tyumen oil and gas not tell you anything? 
In my times as leader of the trust in Samotlor we assimilated 
comparable sums with a large trust in one season. 
  Foreign investors are bypassing Russia. It is not only 
political instability that is to blame for this. It is simply 
that they see that our economy is failing and more and more 
appreciably oligarchic tendencies are coming forth to control 
it. Western entrepreneurs and bankers are surprised at how 
"democratic" we are. They give us to understand in an open 
exchange of opinions that this is good, that the Russians have 
finally recognized the advantages of a market economy, but in 
our enthusiasm for renouncing communism, why should we let the 
economy slide downhill? 
  Not one of the former socialist countries has had such 
pathetic results. Go through the Western supermarkets. They are 
crammed with high-quality clothing from the Chinese provinces, 
Singapore, and even Bangladesh, where people live in shacks like 
during Kipling's times. But you will not see Russian goods of 
export quality next to them on the shelf: They simply are not 
produced. There is a true sign that Russia does not have healthy 
business activity. 
  Light industry has dropped the production of more than half 
of its goods. And the most rapid turnover of capital is here. 
Instead of this the stores and shops throughout Russia are 
filled with discarded imported goods of mediocre quality. And 
the burgeoning network of shops will soon begin to fail because 
of the decline of consumer demand. But all that is trivial 
compared to the closing of mines, shops, and institutes.... 
  Only 57 percent of our 1990 economic potential has remained 
intact. And the decline of production has accelerated sharply in 
recent times. Essentially we are experiencing not the costs of 
reform but economic disaster. True, there are still enthusiasts 
whose heads have not been cleared even by the cold breeze of the 
elections to the Duma, and they are calling for making the 
policy more radical. They are inciting the government to 
"accelerate" the reforms even more. As in the tragic plot from 
the "Golden Calf," these radicals are prepared to saw even more 
weights in two. "But what if suddenly the weights are not made 
of gold?" The people who were about to accept the radicals' 
promises on faith are worried. But in response they hear the 
sacramental: "Saw, Shura, saw." The pragmatic wing in the 
government were hanging onto the coattails of the "monetarists" 
even before. Let us just recall the practical and businesslike 
steps of Chernomyrdin and Soskovets and the demarches of Lobov 
and Zaveryukha. Realists and pragmatists have long been aware 
that the dough being mixed by the "monetarists" will never 
rise.... 
  Thanks to the pragmatists in all stages the economy is still 
functioning somehow and the infrastructures are still whole. The 
government has undertaken a number of protectionist measures to 
protect the national producer. But it is too early to get our 
hopes up. In terms of many indicators, the crisis, I repeat, has 
entered a destructive phase. 
  [Badov] Let us sum up a certain outcome from the Russian 
version of "shock therapy." Is it true, as inveterate optimists 
assert, that the critical phase of the crisis of the economy is 
behind us and the forces of market self-regulation will rectify 
the situation themselves? 
  [Leytland] In January 1992 the "government of intellectuals" 
ventured to refrain from state regulation of economic processes, 
concentrating on macroeconomic policy. So that the market could 
start to function and money would become the "commodity of 
commodities," a simple gentlemen's "collection" was 
proposed--achieving a deficit-free budget, stiffening credit 
policy, and restricting the money supply. The result was the 
opposite of what was expected: There was sharp decline of 
production, high inflation, a growing threat of collapse of the 
state sector, and ineffectiveness of the weak private sector. 
There was an increased tendency toward deindustrialization of 
the national economy with a real prospect of turning Russia into 
a cheap market for raw material and work force for highly 
developed countries. 
  [Badov] But there are also signs that the course is being 
adjusted. 
  [Leytland] The failure of the policy of macro-stabilization 
forced the government to take the reigns but, in the big 
picture, the course that was selected has not changed: from 
liberalization of prices--to demonopolization. Still it seems to 
me that we must take the opposite path, that is, to 
liberalization through the creation of competition. 
  The real condition of the economy, the extreme level of its 
monopolization, and the "difficult" structure as well as the 
lack of an effective competitive environment make it necessary 
to change economic priorities. The potential base for the new 
economic policy would be the consumer sector defining and not 
backward development of it--only it is capable of restoring 
material incentives for labor and accumulation, which will move 
the investment process off the mark. 
  Next I want to say something that will cause general 
indignation among the radicals: During the transition period we 
must keep the key sectors of industry, the most important ones 
for the survival of the entire economy, under state control, 
consistently creating along with this a nonmonopolized, nonstate 
sector. 
  [Badov] Do you really consider it possible to put up with 
monopolies for a certain amount of time? 
  [Leytland] The monopolies have not gone anywhere. The 
problem 
is that all at once, in one fell swoop, we gained a decaying 
market where the monopolists, left uncurbed by the state, 
grabbed us by the throat, establishing arbitrary prices and 
decontrolling production volumes. A change in the form of 
ownership is frequently not accompanied by the elimination of 
monopolies. In order to escape the vicious circle it is 
necessary to use the as yet unforfeited ability of the 
monopolized sector to stabilize and maintain the level of 
industrial production. 
  Further, through state regulation it is necessary to change 
price ratios in the economy in favor of the nonmonopolized 
sector. Such a system of shifting relative prices will make it 
possible to stimulate rapid development of small and 
medium-sized entrepreneurship and to set the mechanism of 
competition in motion. It is necessary to restore the national 
market as well. The most important thing for Russia is still a 
market within the boundaries of the CIS countries. I consider 
the deepening tendency toward isolation of national markets to 
be unpromising and dangerous. 
  [Badov] And what about inflation? 
  [Leytland] There is no miraculous means of curbing inflation 
as long as the factors encouraging it are in play. I would 
include among them the government's eagerness to raise prices of 
energy sources and raw material to the world level while the 
exchange rate of the ruble is declining and monopolized large 
sectors of the economy are uncontrolled, and money is being 
printed in "waves." 
  The only real ways of fighting inflation are at the micro 
level. Such a deep and steady depression throughout the entire 
front of the economy as we have today cannot be surmounted with 
ordinary market methods. I think that in very short periods of 
time the industrialists, trade unions, and government should 
conclude a General Agreement on Wages, Prices, Profit, and 
Capital Investments. After this, officially regulated prices can 
be legally documented as maximum prices. 
  There is an urgent need for indexation of the assets of the 
enterprises. We need an official monthly price indexation based 
on the balance of the industrial and product "baskets," with 
priority for agricultural products. Finally, we must take steps 
to abolish the value added tax in both construction and 
agriculture. 
  [Badov] So you do not share the favorite idea of the 
monetarists about a "deficit-free budget at any price...." 
  [Leytland] A budget with a zero deficit under conditions 
where only half of the pre-perestroyka national income is left 
and you cannot knock very much off state expenses is a utopia. 
The main measures in the area of finance and credit should be 
aimed at surmounting the crisis and stimulating production and 
business activity, which will produce added national income and 
hence more for the budget. 
  The resignation of the "architect of the reform," Gaydar, 
seems to have marked the end of past illusions and seductions. 
We have all emerged from a situation where freedom of 
entrepreneurship was suppressed and denied. To use the apt 
comparison of our great compatriot and Nobel prize winner 
Vasiliy Leontyev, we were trying "to teach penguins to fly" just 
like that. Neither "penguins" nor "storm petrels" will replace 
the pragmatists if we really do not want to create an efficient 
economy where everyone pays his own bills.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Orlov, secretary of the </F>
Organization Bureau of the Russian Free Labor Party (RPST), by 
Vladimir Nazarov: "A Computer Instead of a Megaphone"] 
  [Text] It is easy for a journalist to work with 
Aleksandr Orlov. I must elaborate on this -- you call without 
looking at either the clock or the sheet on the calendar. He is 
practically always at his job, but if he is away on business, 
you can get information from his closest assistants. I did call: 
on Saturday and on Sunday, early in the morning and late at 
night, called without any special need for it. At first this 
"ordnung," so highly valued by Germans, delighted me, but later 
on (a shovel full!) I felt vaguely irritated. What is this, I 
thought, selfless devotion, sacrifice? Or a game? After all, it 
is not a fire brigade, nor a street stall -- it is a party, the 
Russian Free Labor Party (RPST), where Aleksandr Orlov is the 
secretary of the Organization Bureau. He immediately dispelled 
my doubts: 
  "This staff of ours really does do a lot of work -- but not 
under duress, and not because of high wages. We all hold the 
same views, for us the work office is a political club. Who 
watches the clock in a club? I leave work, let's say, at one in 
the morning, and they ask me, with irony: is this free labor? Of 
course, I answer sincerely and very much in earnest: this is the 
freest labor." 
  At this point it was hard for me to keep a straight face. 
The 
point is that Orlov's doctoral dissertation also touched on and 
included the problem of leisure. This was natural, though, and 
offered me grounds for my smile at the RPST. Everything else 
here is serious: the clear vision of goals and tasks, the 
clear-cut work of the staff.... We will go back to this, but for 
now, a little about the party. 
  The RPST is one of the "oldest" in Russia -- it was created 
as far back as 1990. At that time it was a party of newly 
sprung-up entrepreneurs, cooperative workers and farmers. Hence 
its small size, and indeed, small fame. Last June, a "changing 
of the guard" took place at the congress -- Ivan Kivelidi was 
elected chairman, and Aleksandr Orlov headed the organizational 
bureau. Orlov: "several approaches to the party's future 
activity were proposed at the congress. The ones that won -- 
won".... The RPST changed not only its leaders, but also its 
orientation. Now it expresses interest in private ownership. I 
ask Orlov: 
  [Nazarov] Aleksandr Sergeyevich, tell us precisely, how does 
the RPST differ from other entrepreneurial parties? From the 
Borovoy Party, let's suppose.... 
  [Orlov] Roughly speaking, the Borovoy Party is a party of 
large capital, which we concede to it without a fight. In the 
sphere of our work, we have problems of ownership, problems of 
the middle class -- the very class which supports any state -- 
and which is destroyed in our country by the power of property 
owners who do not want to see that this is also destroying the 
country. 
  [Nazarov] A "property owner" is a painfully eroded concept. 
What is the necessary property qualification for entrance into 
the party? 
  [Orlov] Nothing like that. We regard as one of us everyone 
who is aware of the primary human need -- to freely acquire, 
possess and have at one's disposal one's own property. The value 
of the private property or business is of absolutely no 
importance to us: let it be an entire plant or a single share 
bought for a voucher, or intellectual property.... The main 
thing is the psychology of the owner. After all, you can be a 
very rich person and at the same time be a contemptible 
person.... 
  [Nazarov] Aleksandr Sergeyevich, the RPST consists of 50 
regional organizations. This looks like quite a wide-scale 
operation. But there are only 7,500 members.... 
  [Orlov] This is not many? But why is this not many? Indeed, 
there are clearly not enough of these forces for public 
meetings, picketing and street fighting organizations, but 
revolutionary shocks are not incorporated in our strategy or our 
tactics. The party has grown recently, new people have come, and 
more will come -- without a doubt. We are interested not simply 
in the "growth of the ranks," but in qualitative growth. Let us 
say, the Vorkut miners persistently proposed Kivelidi as a 
candidate from their group for the former Supreme Soviet and the 
State Duma. The Cossack oblasts -- on the Don, the Kuban --give 
us good support. This does not at all mean that there are larger 
organizations there. For example, there is only one RPST member 
-- the director -- in the huge Uralmash Plant. Is this a lot or 
a few? Do we need another party committee at the plant? 
  The RPST has true friends, and some of them are sometimes 
still allergic to the word "party." They do not want to legalize 
the membership (and they are acting correctly), but they are 
ours.... Of the well-known people I will name Oleg Tabakov, 
Vladimir Etush, Gennadiy Khazanov.... 
  [Nazarov] You were not noticeable in the past pre-election 
campaign.... 
  [Orlov] We took virtually no part in it. Why should we? 
Nevertheless, we have representatives in both houses of 
parliament, in the government, in the state duma. Indeed, at the 
present regional elections, the local organizations themselves 
decide: whether or not to put forward a candidate from the RPST. 
If yes -- we can finance the pre-election campaign, if not -- we 
do not insist. There are only 28 of our candidates standing for 
election throughout Russia. 
  [Nazarov] If you don't mind, I would like to talk a bit 
about 
the party staff. I heard: The Volskiy Party almost copies the 
work of the CPSU staff. Even the furniture resembles it.... 
  [Orlov] You see, after all, I too went through a period of 
work on the CPSU staff. This is a serious school, it helps me a 
great deal even now. In any case, I know how to organize staff 
work. I know to whom to offer a job and to whom not. For 
example, we don't need specialists in "pumping up" or 
"organizational work," we don't need fiery orators --none of 
these talents are called for in our work.... Our man should work 
with a computer, and not with a megaphone. 
  [Nazarov] Whose talents can be called for in this case? How 
many are on the party staff? 
  [Orlov] We have about 30 people working on the staff. Many 
are scholars: sociologists, economists, political scientists, 
philosophers. The task of today's staff member is expert 
service.... 
  [Nazarov] Boast about your achievements. 
  [Orlov] We have no special achievements yet, perhaps, 
but.... 
Long before 12 December, our sociologists predicted 
Zhirinovskiy's victory at the elections. They also predicted 
sufficient passivity from the electors. 
  We are doing a great deal of interesting work now, as well. 
For example, we are following and analyzing the activity of 
almost 40 parties in Russia.... 
  [Nazarov] Which of them have serious chances for success? 
  [Orlov] This includes Zyurganov's party. After all, in our 
country they either reject it in a narrow-minded way, or extol 
it, without noticing that the party has serious and, in my 
opinion, progressive movements. They have not yet finished with 
extremism, but the directors are seriously looking at the 
social-democrat rails.... 
  [Nazarov] This is noticeable from speaker Ivan Petrovich 
Rybkin. Can you really compare the Rybkin of today with what he 
was a year ago? 
  [Orlov] Rybkin's past, I think, was superficial. The status 
of the man is changing, and his social role is changing. I say 
this to you as a specialist. 
  [Nazarov] Aleksandr Sergeyevich, it is possible that in time 
the situation will change, but for the time being you belong to 
the category of small parties. You have no global tasks on your 
shoulders.... 
  [Orlov] This is the purest delusion. We set ourselves only 
global tasks, and our staff works only on achieving them. 
  [Nazarov] What are they, if it is no secret? 
  [Orlov] It is no secret. We do not absolutely need to have 
our "own" president, a majority in the government or in 
parliament. We are striving for and will continue to strive for 
a change in the political system, since we consider the present 
one to be transitional. We want people not to afraid of the 
state, not to tremble for their property, for their business. We 
want the state to serve the interests of the property owner in 
good faith and truth -- with no dependence on which party gains 
the victory at the next elections. 
  [Nazarov] This will happen? 
  [Orlov] Absolutely. 
  [Nazarov] I read your party documents carefully, and I did 
not find any RPST program in them. 
  [Orlov] We simply don't have one. There cannot be one in the 
current changing situation. We have basic program units by which 
we are guided in our work. 
  [Nazarov] All the same: how does the RPST differ from other 
parties --related and rival? 
  [Orlov] To put it briefly, everyone knows what has to be 
done. But they do not know how! We do know ....

<F P=106> [Report by Ilya Shkabara of the "Mercator Group": </F>
"Preferential Credits Do Not Prevent Unemployment"] 
  [Text] By the beginning of 1994, according to official 
data, 835,000 persons, or 1.4 percent of the able-bodied 
population, were unemployed in the Russian Federation. Against 
the background of countries in the West, where unemployment is 
several times higher, the situation is quite favorable. 
(American economists consider 5 percent of the economically 
active population to be a normal level of unemployment; only if 
unemployment exceeds this limit does it begin to have a harmful 
effect on the economy of the state or a region.) The level of 
unemployment in Russia as a whole is not high at present, but 
some individual regions have already gone past the critical 
point. 
  The following have gone beyond the 5-percent threshold: 
Ivanovo, Kostroma, Pskov, and Yaroslavl oblasts and the 
republics of Dagestan, Kalmykia, Mordovia, and Chuvashia. 
Arkhangelsk and Kirov oblasts and the republics of Adygeya, 
Ingushetia, Northern Osetia, Udmurtia, and Chechnya are coming 
closer to that point. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-048-64A>      Unemployment in the Russian Federation (Beginning of 1994) </FIG>


  There are various reasons why regions are led into such a 
situation. The Northern Caucasus Republic, a region which 
traditionally has a surplus of labor, has been exporting 
manpower for a long time not only to the capital's markets, but 
for construction organizations and seasonal work in practically 
every part of Russia. Many of the unemnployed persons from the 
Caucasus are working quite successfully far from home and are 
more a subject of interest to the tax authorities than social 
security organs. Some 60 percent of the unemployed in the 
Northern Caucasus are under 30 years of age. The ranks of 
criminal gangs and those involved in illegal businesses 
throughout Russia are increasing precisely because of this 
category. Unemployment in this region is reflected in crime from 
Kaliningrad to Sakhalin. And for this reason, the creation of 
jobs in the Northern Caucasus is more a struggle with the source 
of personnel for organized crime. 
  The precipitous production decline in light industry, 
shipbuilding, and sectors of the defense complex has been the 
principal cause of the rise in unemployment in Central Russia 
and the Volga region. 
  The crisis in domestic light industry led to mass firings of 
personnel in Ivanovo, Yaroslavl, and Kostroma oblasts, and the 
high concentration of enterprises in these oblasts led to a 
sharp rise in unemployment. The situation is becoming critical. 
Light industry enterprises do not have effective sectorial 
management organs which could lobby for their interests in the 
government. As a result, local administrations have been forced 
to take extreme measures to surmount the crisis and the 
unemployment which this crisis has caused. 
  The hasty extension of preferential loans and reduction of 
local tax rates have not checked the rate of decline, but they 
have had a substantial effect on the regions' budgets. As a 
result, the budget deficit was 15 billion rubles [R] in Ivanovo 
Oblast, R20 billion in Kostroma Oblast, and only Yaroslavl 
Oblast made ends meet, according to the results for 1993. The 
average wage in these regions is also lagging behind 
substantially. In Ivanovo Oblast, it is 60 percent of the 
average Russian wage and one of the lowest in the Russian 
Federation. (According to Goskomstat [State Committee for 
Statistics] data, the average wage in Russia in January was 
R134,161.) 
  Most of the unemployed in Arkhangelsk, Vladimir, Kirov, and 
Pskov oblasts and republics in the Volga region and Udmurtia 
were employees in the military-industrial complex who were 
discharged. The difficult situation in the defense enterprises 
led to a reduction of over 700,000 persons in 1993, and a 
substantial number of them were added to the army of unemployed. 
The "militarized" regions with a high proportion of the VPK 
[military-industrial complex] in the structure of industry (in 
Udmurtia, for example, every fourth resident was employed in 
defense complex enteprises) have suffered the most. A further 
reduction of military orders stipulated by the budget for 1994 
will lead to new large-scale dismissals, which will aggravate 
the acute social tension in these regions. 
  The rate of increase in unemployment varies in different 
areas as well. The highest rates of increase are observed where 
unemployment is already higher than the average level in Russia. 
In 1993, unemployment in Mordovia rose by three times as much, 
in Kalmykia by 2.4 times as much, in Ivanovo Oblast by 2.2 times 
as much, and in Chuvashia and Udmurtia by two times as much. But 
unemployment has declined since the beginning of the year in the 
cities with the lowest level of unemployment (under 0.5 
percent)--Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
  Depressed regions are being formed where a precipitous 
production recession is combined with a high level of 
unemployment and a low average wage. In due course, the 
depression is deepened and negative socioeconomic processes 
begin to intensify each other. A 1-percent rise in unemployment 
in a depressed region leads to a regional decline of 2.5 percent 
in the gross national product. 
  One-sixth of Russia's population is living in depressed 
regions today, and an effective system for their support needs 
to be established. Available experience in overcoming the 
structural crisis in industry should form the basis of the 
program. Nizhegorod, Samara, and Saratov oblasts, where the 
proportion of the military-industrial complex is no less than in 
Vladimir or Kirov oblasts, have resolved the problem by close 
integration between industrial and commercial structures. The 
use of commercial bank loans to supplement enterprises' working 
capital, targeted financing, and the formation of 
industrial-financial groups--this is far from a complete list of 
promising types of collaboration. Incidentally, it is 
characteristic that most of the territories which are going 
through a depression are lagging behind in the voucher rating at 
privatization auctions as well. A collapse is a collapse. On all 
points! 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-048-65A>      Depressed Regions in Russia </FIG>


  The opportunities of federal organs of authority are very 
limited today. By transferring to the regions a substantial part 
of its powers, the state has relinquished a significant part of 
its obligations. The transfer of 90 percent of employment fund 
resources to the regions has led to the point that the 
government has deprived itself of the opportunity to 
redistribute funds to the most needy territories. Because of the 
situation that has taken shape, it would have been sensible to 
make the federal organs of authority responsible for 
redistributing all the employment fund assets and provide a 
favorable environment for investments aimed at creating new jobs 
in the depressed regions.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Sorokin under the rubric "Chronicles of </F>
the Absurd": "Mikhail Poltoranin Likes To Have Journalists 
Eating Out Of His Hand"] 
  [Text] Two days ago the State Duma passed in the 
first reading a federal law, the text of which has accidentally 
ended up in my hands. 
  It makes sense to examine the law in more detail because 
this 
is one of the first laws passed by our new parliament (it seems 
that only the law on the status of deputies and the amnesty 
decree, which has the force of law, came before it). The law on 
deputy status did have a precursor--a similar law of the 
previous, now dispersed, Supreme Soviet, and the amnesty decree 
was initially submitted by the president altogether, whereas 
this draft is, so to say, a product of the Duma's own creativity 
and is without parallel in our legislation. 
  Unfortunately it seems to be without parallel in another 
respect--in terms of its absurdity and inferiority. 
  The law describes "procedures for coverage of organs of 
state 
power in the state mass media" and was submitted by the relevant 
committee (chairman Mikhail Poltoranin). I do not know what 
behind-the-scenes struggle preceded the emergence of this draft 
and who schemed against whom, but I can confidently maintain 
that there was an intrigue. First, the draft law invades, and 
invades very substantially, a quite specific professional 
sphere--journalism as a whole and TV journalism in particular. 
However, as far as I can judge from the silence of the press, 
not one major professional journalist was familiarized with the 
text in advance. For example, can a person who has never sat 
behind a steering wheel in his life single-handedly establish 
the rules of the road? Perhaps he can, but it is clear what is 
going to happen at intersections. 
  Either they, naive as babes in the woods, counted on the law 
making it through before the press "gets wind of it" (even if it 
does make it through, who is going to comply?), or some of the 
editors knew but were as silent as guerrillas.... 
  In principle I can even compile a list of the names of these 
guerrillas; it is easy to guess. The traces of intrigue remain 
in the text of the draft law. Actually, we are looking at two or 
even three completely different laws which are crudely fitted 
inside one another without even being polished in any way. 
  The first law, let us call it the original one, corresponds 
to the general headline: "On Procedures for Coverage of 
Activities of Organs of State Power by STATE Mass Media" 
(emphasis mine--Yuriy Sorokin). The very first article (the 
subject regulated by the law) explains that at issue are 
precisely the state mass media, i.e. those that are founded by 
organs of power and, consequently, it does apply to other mass 
media (which are independent of the state). 
  A norm follows thereafter which is new in our legislation 
and 
which I as a journalist who has not yet lost his taste for 
freedom cannot but welcome: It says in black and white that 
state organs of all kinds CANNOT BE founders of the mass media 
(with the exception of those publishing official communications 
only). That is to say, the state retains for itself utterly 
official publications such as SBORNIK UKAZOV...and 
PRAVITELSTVENNYY VESTNIK, whereas the rest are free.... 
  In the immemorial time of perestroyka, when the current 
adviser to the president Yuriy Baturin together with Mikhail 
Fedotov and Vladimir Entin wrote their first draft law on the 
FREEDOM of the press, which became the base for all subsequent 
laws--even they did not proceed to insert such a norm in the 
draft law, their entire ceremonious but unyielding democratism 
of the time notwithstanding. This quite obviously was not 
"passable" material.... 
  At present, this norm is already perceived as commonplace. 
Most mass media have long ceased to be owned by the state de 
jure. Technically, neither KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, nor TRUD, to 
say nothing of the new, recently started newspapers and 
magazines have to report to the state concerning anything: Some 
have, to the noise of three revolutions in a row, reregistered 
as publications founded by collectives of journalists or public 
or private organizations independent of the authorities; others 
have been established by private individuals or independent 
structures from the very beginning. 
  Until recently there were exceptions--some central and local 
publications which fell victim to the last skirmish of the two 
branches of power in October, for example, in the case of 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, which the president in essence took away 
from the routed parliament. However, under this new law, which I 
call the original one, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will also be set free. 
  A knowledgeable legislator without a hidden agenda up his 
sleeve would perhaps leave off here. It does not make sense to 
describe the entire procedure for the publication of official 
communications by the state informational organs in detail at 
the legal level--first, because very few such publications 
remain; second, a law cannot be written to cover absolutely all 
occasions anyway. It would be much simpler and more feasible to 
appoint obedient and diligent state officials (editors) to state 
publications with whom all issues would be resolved "on a 
routine footing." 
  It is just that, taking into account the sad Russian 
tradition of self-devouring authorities, it would have made 
sense to restrict in the law the very list of official 
publications, striking a balance and clearly indicating to which 
of the branches of power each publication should belong. There 
is even more reason to do so because the official organs should 
obviously be financed directly from the budget, and it is the 
direct responsibility of the parliament elected by the people to 
count the taxpayer's money. This is it. I repeat that this is 
where a legislator should leave off if he seeks to ensure 
precisely the thing he talks about publicly. 
  However, our legislator is not like that. 
  A text from a quite different quarter has been inserted into 
the original text of the law devoted solely to STATE mass media. 
Specifically, Article 4, which in essence regulates the 
relationship between the state and the entire INDEPENDENT press 
altogether, and then on the most essential score--financial. 
From the point of view of canons, this is like an excerpt from a 
manual on steel pouring being printed in a cookbook. First, the 
relationship between the state and the independent press is 
regulated by a separate law, and if something needs to be 
changed, amendments to the already existing law should be passed 
or yet another, new law should be passed. In any event, this 
issue should be voted on separately rather than attached to a 
law devoted to another, unimportant problem. Second, this is 
about money and, as we will see, a lot of it; therefore, a 
separate consideration is even more necessary because this 
substantially increases the expenditure side of the budget. 
Third, although this is poetry, actually such legislative 
changes in the financial relationship between the state and the 
independent press, as we will see, call into question the 
independence of the press in general, and this already amounts 
to an incursion into the sphere of constitutional liberties.... 
  However, it is clear that those who inserted Article 4 into 
the original text did not act out of glaring incompetence; quite 
the opposite. It is precisely a separate vote on this issue that 
they were trying to avoid, aware that in that case the alignment 
of votes would be uncertain, to put it mildly. This is why I 
have the right to talk about a scheme. However, just as 
paleontologists restore the image of a dinosaur based on the 
imprint of its hind leg preserved in hard coal, I can restore 
the image of the giant who walked through here from the text of 
Article 4.... 
  It reads: 
  "Printed periodicals shall publish materials or 
communications of the state organs of the Russian Federation and 
its components under contracts and at a fee out of the funds 
allocated from the relevant budget to ensure the operation of 
these state organs." 
  It is precisely the independent press that is meant here by 
"printed periodicals" because the dependent press is named the 
"state mass media," and this is specifically mentioned in the 
text. A numerical calculation, which judging from the signature 
was prepared by one I.Ye. Vybornova, chairman of the 
subcommittee for economic support of the mass media, is enclosed 
with the text. I am not going to give the details of these 
numbers. I ask that you trust me as a professional 
newspaperman--the numbers are stupid and pulled out of a hat. 
However, two circumstances are important to us in this instance: 
First, it is suggested that the state will pay the newspapers 
for the latter to communicate the fact of the existence of the 
state on a daily basis AT ADVERTISING RATES, and that the total 
amount will exceed 40 billion rubles [R], apparently in the few 
months to come (incidentally, no precise time period is 
indicated). 
  So, if we perceive all that has been written here literally, 
it is plain gobbledygook. As is known, the independent press 
does not publish the texts of laws, official acts, and so on. At 
best it offers information on them and as a rule such 
information is prejudiced. It is somehow absurd to pay state 
money for this. Besides, it does not make sense--this is money 
going the drain because, whether or not the state pays, the 
independent press will offer information about all state events 
and decrees of any consequence in any event--after all, nobody 
would read a large proportion of the newspapers otherwise, and 
they would go bankrupt. Paying at advertising rates is 
impossible; advertisement is goods by the piece, and the cost of 
newspaper space for advertising is measured in centimeters. For 
example, how are you going to calculate how many centimeters in 
the discourse of a particular commentator may be appraised as 
advertising for a state organ? Incidentally, which organ? The 
president? But what if the commentator praises the Duma and, as 
of today, dislikes the president? 
  However, it is not worthwhile to sort through all this 
delirium because this is not what it was meant for. Actually, 
this is about so-called state subsidies for the press, except 
that this time the issue is hidden within new and not very 
fortunate packaging. It is hidden because in the open it would 
run into quite legitimate resistance. 
  The issue of subsidies for the press arose most acutely 
after 
the price explosion in January 1992. Since the funds for 
subscriptions were collected for one year in advance, still at 
old prices, it was clear that newspapers would not survive given 
soaring prices for newsprint, transportation, energy, services 
of the Ministry of Communications, and so on. The situation was 
piquant because by then most central newspapers had either 
registered their independence from the state or had claimed 
such. However, all of them demanded money from the state in 
unison at that point. Ultimately, the state proceeded to do 
this, despite Gaydar's categorical objections. Most newspapers 
got subsidies (tremendous amounts for the budget), although a 
few with the largest circulation, in particular KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA and TRUD, got the lion's share of subsidies. This measure 
may have been justified at that point in order to prevent a 
cataclysmic collapse of the press at the initial stage of 
reforms (at the time most of the press supported them). 
  Besides, having allocated the money, the government could 
not 
help getting certain things in return. This function of 
collecting ideological tribute from the newspapers was assumed 
by Mikhail Poltoranin, minister of the press at the time. 
Mikhail Nikiforovich liked to have journalists eating out of his 
hand. For him this was a huge and interesting area of work: to 
compile lists of publications, to weigh thoroughly and for a 
long time whom to give or not to give subsidies, to discuss this 
with editors, naturally giving advice in the process as to what 
tone they should write in and about which branch of power.... 
However, in the public eye Mikhail Nikiforovich, on the 
contrary, appeared as the only savior of the free press: Look, I 
have pushed through the subsidies, and I push them through every 
day.... The microscopic sum he allocated to the newspapers 
PRAVDA and SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA at the time gave him the pretext 
to regularly refer to himself on TV screens as the model of a 
Genuine Democrat: Look, I have given money to the opposition, 
too. (At the time few people pondered the fact that this 
particular opposition suited the government.) 
  In the few years since, the situation in the newspaper 
market 
has changed qualitatively. The circulation of all newspapers has 
dropped substantially, not right away but rather gradually, and 
nothing horrible has happened. The sky has not fallen. Quite the 
contrary, the combined circulation of publications has not 
changed all that much; the readership was redistributed. It came 
out that a tremendous number of "central" newspapers (which was 
natural in a huge, strictly centralized state) was apparently 
just not needed in a much smaller country which, in addition, is 
structured on the federal rather than totalitarian principle. It 
has been precisely local and regional publications that have 
developed. New nonpoliticized publications have come along 
which, it transpires, can survive on their own. Banks have 
appeared which have already matured enough to finance 
newspapers, thus relieving the state of this burden. However, 
the payment of subsidies has continued, though understandably 
not to all. As a result the situation in the newspaper market 
has begun to assume slightly absurd features: Prices for 
newsprint and everything else are growing; the still centralized 
Rospechat [Main Directorate for Press Distribution of the 
Ministry of Communications] is unable to handle the distribution 
of newspapers and is also demanding greater funds, likewise the 
postal service; the number of subscribers is falling steadily, 
but the number of newspapers is increasing anyway! There is a 
shortage of journalists already! 
  The subsidies are one of the principal reasons. Tens of 
thousands of tonnes of wasted paper are returned as scrap 
because dozens of publications exist in the old, preserved form 
due to subsidies. The impossibility of accomplishing oneself 
while working in a press that is independent de jure but not de 
facto, which is becoming increasingly obvious to journalists, is 
another reason. The reluctance of the regions to have a press 
dependent solely on an uncle from Moscow is yet another reason, 
and so on, and so forth, all the way to the readers' desire to 
have a choice.... 
  I am not maintaining that state assistance to the press is 
completely unnecessary: The newspaper business is very risky, 
and regulatory intervention of the state in one form or another 
is necessary. The forms of such intervention which are accepted 
in civilized countries have long been known: Primarily tax 
relief (newspapers are still fleeced at the rate of commercial 
enterprises); second, subsidization of the relevant mail and 
communication services (which in essence would amount to moving 
the money from one of the state's pockets to another), and 
finally, leasing of premises to publications at preferential 
rates (meanwhile, in our country, even in the notorious House of 
the Press on Pushkin Street in Moscow, "merchants" were 
ensconced upon "merchants" who naturally had the resources to 
give bribes). 
  Finally, the state must of course maintain a comparatively 
small proportion of publications (in terms of 
funding)--specialized children's, medical, scientific, etc. 
publications. Incidentally, even they can be financed out of 
other relevant items of expenditure, and no political allusions 
will arise in this matter. 
  All of this has been known for a long time and published 100 
times. Why does the issue of subsidies surface, as we can see, 
yet again and in this sophisticated form? 
  As the saying goes, look for the one who benefits.... 
  In very simple terms, subsidies are necessary for a few 
dozen 
small publications, of whose existence, I am convinced, an 
overwhelming majority of the population is not even aware; these 
publications will immediately die off in the absence of 
subsidies. Besides, the two supermonopoly giants of the domestic 
press, TRUD and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, apparently insist on 
subsidies. It is precisely subsidies that help them maintain 
their circulation at the quite high level of a few million 
copies. However, neither newspaper will collapse if it is 
deprived of subsidies: It is just that their circulations will 
drop (the circulation of the already mentioned KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA has dropped in recent years from 22 million to 3 million, 
but the people were not left without information 
nonetheless--nature abhors a vacuum). Why does KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA need a circulation that is still huge by current 
standards, even at the price of losing real independence from 
state structures and a continuous shortage of funds to pay for 
newsprint? Perhaps KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA does not need this, but 
the Komsomolskaya Pravda Joint-Stock Company does. The size of 
profits from advertisements depends on circulation, and these 
profits of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA are not measured in tens of 
millions. Naturally they are not returned to any budget but are 
rather put to use again through commercial structures of the 
Komsomolskaya Pravda Joint-Stock Company. It seems to me that we 
know what to call the allocation of sums going into billions 
from the state budget to a private commercial company which 
extracts profits from them and distributes the profits among its 
people. It is just that the legal practice of the world appears 
to lack a term for instances in which the parliament is involved 
in this. 
  A companion memorandum enclosed with the draft law is signed 
by the chairman of the Committee for Information Policy--indeed, 
the same Mikhail Nikiforovich Poltoranin. I do not intend to 
suspect the former minister, who still cultivates a warm 
relationship with the leaders of a number of publications, of 
being commercially interested--this will never be proven! 
However, Mikhail Poltoranin's political interest is obvious: 
After all, tax relief, which can truly improve the situation of 
the entire press, does not call for creating some kind of 
structure which would once again carve up the pie and, 
therefore, keep the hungry on a leash. 
  Meanwhile subsidies--even in the form of "payments for 
advertising the state," ridiculous as it might be--do call for 
creating some kind of commission or committee that will decide 
how much to give to whom, and who ran the better or worse 
advertisement. Understandably, whoever heads this committee will 
have informal influence on the two largest newspapers in the 
country, and therefore carry an altogether different political 
weight of his own.... 
  However, this does not exhaust the list of incongruences (or 
congruences--depending on the angle you take) in the text of the 
draft law. 
  Further on, after this small extraneous insert which will 
cost the taxpayer R45 billion, an altogether wild text follows 
that is devoted to the problems of our poor television, 
virtually all of which, with the exception of Independent 
Television, is unfortunately state-owned. 
  At first the issue is what television is obliged to show in 
newscasts. In the opinion of the legislator, newscasts should 
consist of a demonstration of what the various organs of power 
from the very top to the very bottom, along both the executive 
and representative vertical chains of command, are doing. 
  I quote: 
  "The state audiovisual mass media of federal significance 
shall include, on the day of occurrence of the event in 
question, in all informational programs reports on: 
  "decisions and actions falling within the jurisdiction of 
the 
Russian Federation president or the Russian Federation 
Constitutional Court, or constituting the responsibility of the 
chambers of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly in keeping 
with Articles 88, 93, Part 2, Article 87, Part 2, Article 92, 
Part 2, Article 108, Parts 2 and 3, Article 111, Points a), c), 
and e), Article 83, Points a), b), c), and f), Part 1, Article 
84, Points a), b), c), d), and e), Part 1, Article 102, Points 
a), b), f) and g), Part 1, Article 103 of the Constitution of 
the Russian Federation. 
  "The state audiovisual mass media of federal significance 
shall include, on the day of occurrence of the event in 
question, in all informational programs reports on: 
  "decisions and actions falling within the jurisdiction of 
the 
Russian Federation president or the Russian Federation 
Constitutional Court, or constituting the responsibility of the 
chambers of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly in keeping 
with Parts 1, 4, and 5, Article 102, Points c), d) and e), 
Article 103 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation; 
  "statements of the Russian Federation president, chambers of 
the Russian Federation Federal Assembly, and the Russian 
Federation Government; 
  "presentations by the chairman of the Russian Federation 
Government, deputy chairmen of the Russian Federation 
Government, and federal ministers at the proceedings of the 
chambers of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly; 
  "press conferences of the Russian Federation president, the 
chairman of the Russian Federation Government, the chairman of 
the Federation Council of the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly, the chairman of the State Duma of the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly, as well as press conferences held 
by decisions of the committees, commissions, factions, or deputy 
groups of the chambers of the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly; 
  "other publicly significant facts of activities of the 
federal organs of state power. 
  "The state audiovisual mass media of federal significance 
must ensure prompt information for TV viewers and radio 
listeners concerning official visits by the heads of foreign 
states and governments to the Russian Federation, as well as 
about official visits abroad of the Russian Federation president 
and delegations of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly or 
the Russian Federation Government...." 
  Alas, this is just the beginning. These are merely 
newscasts, 
and everything else follows on several pages. Everything is 
regimented--the time of broadcasting (prior to 2400), an 
opportunity to cut advertisement into the stream of official 
reports (impossible), the length and frequency of other 
programs, coordination procedures, and so on. Even the 
"preferential right" of the speaker on the principal issue to 
appear on the air is envisioned, as well as that of a deputy who 
has spoken at a meeting if his point of view has won a certain 
number of votes. It is envisioned that all these programs should 
not overlap in time if they are broadcast on different channels. 
The order in which video episodes should be placed is 
envisioned: first, about the parliament, then about then 
president, then about the governments, and so on, up to 
mandatory participation by journalists in "informational and 
educational programs" about the operation of the state organs 
and criminal liability for violating the present law. 
  It is instructive that all this legislative gibberish is 
subsequently extended from the federal, central level to all 
others in descending order. According to the beautifully 
consistent bureaucratic thought, the same should be happening to 
local radio and television! That is to say, the local 
authorities do not have the right to sort things out even with 
their own television--here is the federation for you.... 
  In general I am recounting all this with amazement rather 
than outrage: Unlike the issue of subsidies, this part of the 
"law" is absolutely harmless because it cannot be carried out in 
principle. It would be easier to close television down. Besides, 
sooner or later the state will be compelled to set television 
free just as it did newspapers: It is impossible to maintain 
television out of the budget. 
  However, another point is the most essential in this 
instance--that this, if we may say so, draft law has been passed 
by the Duma in the first reading. While I have loved the 
parliament for a long time and with devotion regardless of who 
is in it, just as a symbol of hope that one day we will be all 
right, too, I cannot but note that the continuous struggle of 
the democrats against parliamentarism has borne fruit. Obviously 
the current Duma does not have legal personnel with any degree 
of skill (all of them have long been in the presidential 
structures, banks, or overseas; besides, who is going to come to 
a place where shots are fired, and not blank ones!). Meanwhile, 
a parliament is first of all a research establishment, and only 
then a voting machine. The parliament should have at its 
disposal the best personnel, time, and material potential in 
order to not vote on such gibberish. As the first attempt 
indicates, our parliament lacks all these. A few more "tries" of 
this nature and the Duma will indeed have to be disbanded: After 
all, control of a spaceship cannot be entrusted to the intellect 
of an ape.

<F P=106> [Interview with Itskhak Bannai, manager of the YUBEKS </F>
Company, by TRUD correspondent Nikita Shevtsov, in Antwerp; date 
not given: "Uncut Diamonds--This Is a Way of Life"] 
  [Text] My interlocutor--Itskhak Bannai--is the 
manager of the YUBEKS Company, which is located in the Belgian 
city of Antwerp; it is considered one of the fastest developing 
and promising firms operating on the uncut and cut diamond 
market. It has subsidiary and joint enterprises in many 
countries of the world. Not many people know that YUBEKS became 
the first foreign firm that started to cut diamonds in Russia 
jointly with the Smolensk production association Kristall. The 
discussion in our interview mainly centered on the peculiarities 
of the diamond business and how it is developing in the world, 
particularly in our country. 
  [Shevtsov] Mr. Bannai, why and how did you decide to work in 
the diamond business? 
  [Bannai] Most of all, because diamonds are not simply a 
business, but a way of life. Work on them can even be equated to 
art. I see this business as a hobby that, in addition, can bring 
in an income. Although, based on economic interests, on my part 
it would be more advisable to concentrate my principal attention 
on other more profitable forms of activity of our companies. 
  The cut-uncut diamond business is a closed business in which 
in order to win one's own "place under the sun" it is necessary 
to pass a very difficult survival exam. He who engages in this 
business finds himself under unusual conditions, in which an 
especially important role is played by confidential relations 
with partners, and the word you give has primary value. 
  I joined the diamond business immediately after completing 
studies at a university in Paris. I started to learn it in 
Israel, where I studied and worked in shops and became familiar 
with gemology. Further, our company was among the first to 
master the "princess" type of cut, which was new at that time. 
Given the availability of a certain type of raw material, this 
cut makes it possible to obtain a very beautiful diamond with a 
quadrilateral form. The losses from the initial weight are 
extremely insignificant. Thereby, the coefficient of 
effectiveness of its use is greatly increased. Thus, it can be 
said that this is what started our penetration into the 
uncut-cut diamond business. 
  [Shevtsov] Are any changes occurring now in world trade in 
the uncut and cut diamond business? 
  [Bannai] It is well known that the uncut-cut diamond 
business 
is to a large degree conservative. But in recent years it has 
undoubtedly been experiencing important changes, especially in 
the sphere of the new technology for processing uncut diamonds. 
At the same time, the concept of sales is changing and being 
improved. Broad prospects for the development of new markets in 
the east are emerging--first and foremost in China and Russia, 
where one-quarter of the population of the planet lives. It is 
precisely there that new diamond buyers should appear. 
  [Shevtsov] But after all, they are very expensive, and the 
incomes of the people in these countries is rather low... 
  [Bannai] First, there is reason to hope that the incomes of 
the population in these countries will increase. And, second, it 
should not be thought that all diamonds are very expensive. Of 
course, there are diamonds that cost hundreds of thousands and 
even millions of dollars. But on the other hand there are the 
kind that in principle are accessible to everyone. They can be 
acquired for several dozen dollars. Thus, the dream of diamonds 
is realizable not only for the rich. 
  [Shevtsov] How is the activity of your company conducted on 
the Russian market? 
  [Bannai] I visited Russia as a businessman for the first 
time 
in 1989. During a visit to the Smolensk production association 
Kristall we began to hold negotiations on the creation of a 
joint enterprise for cutting diamonds. And although they were 
quickly concluded with success, a considerable amount of time 
passed before it was possible to establish a joint enterprise 
between our company and the Smolensk plant that really began for 
the first time to engage in diamond cutting. It was given the 
name Kristalldiam, and after three years became one of the major 
producers of diamonds, among similar joint enterprises existing 
in Russia. In addition, its product is distinguished by the high 
quality of faceting for which Russian diamonds, particularly 
Smolensk diamonds, have long been famous. We were the first to 
produce the Princess diamond cut in Russia. Right after our 
enterprise, other Russian plants began to do this also. All 
told, with the participation of YUBEKS five joint enterprises 
engaged in diamond cutting have been established in Russia. 
  [Shevtsov] What do you think of the condition of the 
uncut-cut diamond industry in Russia? 
  [Bannai] I want to say that, despite the economic crisis 
that 
has struck practically all branches of the economy of Russia, 
this industry is one of very few that has succeeded in 
maintaining its position. Although, of course, its development 
is being negatively affected by the instability of the political 
situation, the developing crime-conducive situation, and also 
the fact that some enterprises have ended up outside Russia. 
  Unfortunately, there is no clear concept of the development 
of the uncut diamond processing industry on a countrywide scale. 
Moreover, this branch attracts a large number of people who do 
not understand it very well. Nevertheless, they try to influence 
the course of events. Some of them think that Russia should sell 
its raw materials only to De Beers, and others that it should 
not sell diamonds at all, inasmuch as this leads to a 
"squandering" of the national wealth, etc. A lot of inaccurate 
and incorrect articles have appeared in the press. Unjustified 
attacks are frequently made on such state structures as 
Komdragmet of Russia, Almazyuvelireksport, and Diamonds of 
Yakutia-Sakha. But after all, high-class professionals work in 
these structures who like and understand their business. 
  It is clear that it is necessary to sell the main mass of 
uncut diamonds and the products received from them. If Russia 
does not trade in uncut and cut diamonds, others will start to 
do so for it, squeezing it out of the international market. Of 
course, reserves of uncut diamonds must exist, but in reasonable 
limits. It is no accident that the United States regularly 
resorts to the sale of uncut diamonds from the strategic 
reserves. In the last two years this tendency has intensified 
even more. 
  Now, for example, the value of technical uncut diamonds has 
dropped sharply. Prices for them were reduced by 20-30 percent 
in the last year. A situation has developed in which even De 
Beers cannot and indeed does not want to control the situation 
in the technical uncut diamond market. I, for example, consider 
absolutely groundless the De Beers assertion that Russia, 
allegedly in circumvention of an agreement reached with this 
monopoly, has flooded the international uncut diamond market, 
which will lead to a drop in prices for them. How then in such a 
case, while announcing the arrival on the world market of an 
excess of uncut diamonds from Russia, did De Beers itself 
increase deliveries by 30 percent, thereby attaining a record 
level of sales for its entire 120-year history of existence. 
  Of course, if Russia takes the path of development of its 
own 
diamond-cutting production, this will to some degree weaken the 
monopoly position of De Beers. In turn, Russia will feel more 
confident on the international cut diamond market. I think that 
your country, from the position of an equal, could come to an 
agreement with De Beers about your real place in this market. Of 
course this is not easy, but it is possible. 
  For this the state must first decide how many and what kind 
of uncut diamonds it wants to cut, and also guarantee the 
necessary raw material to diamond-cutting plants for a long 
period. In addition, the government has to consider that in 
offering raw material to plants according to a price list 
coordinated with De Beers, a high profit will be assured from 
the production of cut diamonds. This is explained by the fact 
that additional well-paid jobs are established, and the treasury 
receives stable deductions from the payment of high taxes. The 
diamond-cutting plants gain their own capital, and they are not 
listed among the state debtors. 
  I am a supporter of the centralized distribution of diamonds 
in Russia among enterprises engaged in their cutting. However, 
of course, they should be received only by serious firms that 
simultaneously with trade ensure the employment of the 
population. In addition, it is necessary to establish a 
secondary raw materials market in Russia and also to encourage 
Russian firms to establish subsidiary enterprises in other 
countries. They should join in partner relations with foreign 
companies that have colossal experience in activity on the 
international market. It is also necessary to support and 
strengthen those Russian structures headed by Komdragmet, which, 
speaking for a continuation of cooperation with De Beers, at the 
same time do not plan to do the bidding of this monopoly, first 
and foremost protecting the interests of Russia and its uncut 
diamond industry.

<F P=106> [Report on statements made by First Vice Premier Oleg </F>
Soskovets at collegium meeting with the directors of metallurgy 
enterprises: "`It Is Difficult for Everyone--In Different 
Ways...'"] 
  [Text] After the resignation of Ye. Gaydar and B. 
Fedorov, the mass media reported that the corps of directors had 
come to power, that the government would carry out its will, and 
consequently, that an end had been put to the reforms in Russia. 
What was the basis for such conclusions? It would be better to 
make a judgment on industrial policy based on the actual 
relationships between the government and enterprise directors, 
not on the basis of theoretical arguments. In this connection, 
their meeting in an expanded collegium of the Russian Federation 
Committee on Metallurgy was significant. The directors of the 
basic sector of domestic industry--metallurgy--and a number of 
government officials headed by First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets 
held a dialogue which did not conform to what has been described 
by our SMI [mass media], let us say frankly. The directors did 
not speak as the opponents of reforms. The government was in no 
hurry to compliment "the generals of industry." This was a 
meeting of pragmatists, first of all. 
  Essentially all the problems facing the Russian economy are 
concentrated in enterprises of the country's metallurgical 
complex, because they are the ones who have incurred the largest 
expenditures for energy consumption, locked in all the country's 
mining and 25 percent of the coal industry, and taken over a 
substantial part of the output of the machinebuilding complex 
and the electrical engineering industry, and so forth. These 
problems must be resolved, because without the metallurgical 
industry, the Russian economy cannot be reformed any further: 
metallurgy is the foundation on which all industry stands. 
  The country's basic and most important sector is in crisis 
today, and no matter how painful its manifestations are, 
searching for those at fault for this situation in the central 
departments in Moscow is unlikely to be correct. And not only 
because metallurgy is always the focus of close attention by the 
government (it is sufficient to remember that the government 
examined stabilization of the work of a number of subsectors of 
the metallurgical complex on several occasions last year), but 
primarily because today metallurgical enterprises are 
independent subjects of economic activity and subjects of the 
market. And they should operate independently. But it seems to 
me that many metallurgical enterprise managers have not realized 
this fact yet, and have not completely adapted themselves to 
conditions in an economy which is being reformed. 
  There are reasons for this. Centralization in industry, 
for which ministries were used as a tool in the USSR, was 
probably most apparent in enterprises subordinate to the 
Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy and Ministry of Nonferrous 
Metallurgy. Let us remember how the ministers "trained" the 
directors in selective conferences. The commands are still fresh 
in most of their minds: "Stop production--give the converted 
metal back to the cooperatives... Discontinue domestic 
deliveries--set aside so many metric tons for export, so many 
for the Ministry of Defense..." We were trained to work by 
command and in accordance with volume indicators, and although 2 
or 3 years ago we were studying the work of foreign firms and 
invited the presidents of concerns and representatives of 
joint-stock companies who have been working under market 
conditions all their lives, we have not been able to develop 
anything similar to their system of management. 
  We denationalized property and formed shareholding 
enterprises, and we essentially limited ourselves to this. After 
acquiring a basis for independent economic operation, we began 
setting prices ourselves. Transport workers set rates which, 
from their point of view, were the best possible to maintain the 
sector. Can the prices for energy resources be called abnormal 
if the power engineers set them freely, guided by the very 
specific situation in which they found themselves? Ask any 
manager in the Ministry of Fuel and Energy about this, and he 
will say that all the prices for electric power announced for 
consumers through the RAO [Russian Joint-Stock Company] "YeES 
Rossiya" are based on the cost of the metal, coal, and so on. 
But as a result we arrived at a situation in which no one can do 
anything: everyone owes each other. Who has to set up a system 
for payments between enterprises, in accordance with laws 
drafted by the government, of course? The Ministry of Finance? 
Of course not. Who has to ensure that the banks, whose founders 
are engaged in economic operations, provide for effective 
demand? The government? Also no. We have to say frankly that a 
management system has not been created in metallurgy. 
  A Committee on Metallurgy has been established, and it 
performs a great deal of useful work in shaping government 
policy with respect to the sector, but metallurgists have not 
been able to come to agreement among themselves. Beginning with 
the mining enterprises, through all the production conversions 
right down to the fourth process stage, there are absolutely no 
financial relationships--those relationships which can establish 
and maintain the necessary production ties in any 
situation--among the subjects engaged in economic operations. A 
management system is able to identify the common interests of 
enterprises and unify them, not in accordance with a formal 
characteristic, but because of their economic, financial, and 
property linkage. It is precisely this link which is traced in 
the classical structure of any Western concern associated with 
metallurgy, whether it is a technological or multisectorial 
association. It is precisely this link which creates additional 
interest for the producer and is the stimulus for production. 
Until we establish it, it is very difficult to speak about 
stopping the manifestations of the crisis at some stage. 
  We are now attempting to unite the interests of miners and 
metallurgists, miners and transport workers, aluminum producers 
and power engineers, and we are speaking about cartel 
agreements, which may be only natural for economic subjects in 
the current stage from the viewpoint of tariffs, and on the 
other hand, from the viewpoint of prices for finished products. 
But this kind of agreement remains on paper if its participants 
make a stand for their narrow interests and are oriented not 
toward the final ton on which each one's profit is calculated, 
not toward the production cycle as a whole and all the 
processing stages, right up to completion of the end product, 
but only toward the stage associated with their direct activity. 
Civilized approaches to relationships between economic subjects 
are well-known in the world, and we have to develop them as well 
if we do not want to return to the old system, which should be 
ruled out completely today. We must not go back to the command 
system, but forward, toward a financial system of management. 
  Today we cannot pay for Kazakhstan coal for the 
Magnitogorsk, 
Nizhniy Tagil, and Orsk-Khalilovo combines, for chromium ore for 
Chelyabinsk and Serov, and we cannot count on Ukrainian 
enterprises... We should not think that we can get along without 
that part of the raw material and production base which was left 
with the near abroad after the collapse of the USSR, and that 
Russia is in a position to restore everything that it lost. 
According to our estimates, this would cost the country $12 
billion. Will the taxpayer understand us if we ask him to pay 
such a sum? Of course not. Based on professional knowledge of 
technological production facilities and experience in personal 
relationships, it is incumbent upon us to restore ties and 
reactivate a unified metallurgicl complex, but only through 
financial relationships, which should become the basis for the 
system of metallurgy management which we have to create. 
  I am following how the situation in our economy is being 
interpreted in the West. There they say the Central Bank is 
chiefly at fault for the lack of the results needed in the 
reform, because it supposedly is extending credit to state 
enterprises. But this is not the case. We have to acknowledge 
the complete absence of a state system for increasing investment 
activity. Metallurgy, like a number of other sectors, was given 
substantial benefits related to customs duties, export 
operations, and currency deductions last year. But these 
benefits did nothing to increase investment activity: because of 
the crisis in effective demand, a substantial part of the funds 
released were directed to the consumption fund. 
  Unfortunately, we do not hear the voice of enterprise 
managers, and they have to raise questions about costs in the 
government's work, credit and financial problems, and on both 
tax and pricing problems, that is, on key questions where the 
government has to work out the basic rules of the game in 
accordance with which economic subjects should interact between 
themselves and with the state. The most important subject for 
our economic policy is the change of enterprises to 
shareholding, which should produce definite results in the 
activity of each economic subject; the urgent task of organizing 
a banking system is extremely important as well. 
  The government can resolve all these matters only with the 
help of our specialists. We will not find any others who know 
domestic metallurgy and understand the problems facing it.

<F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Solovyev, secretary of the FITUR </F>
[Russian Federation of Independent Trade Unions] Council: "No 
One Is Sorry for the People in `Communal Accomodations'"] 
  [Text] State apartments free of charge disappeared in 
the previous era. Millions of Russian families have remained in 
cramped, dilapidated, damaged housing. Does the Russian 
Government intend to provide support for the disadvantaged, who 
are not in a position to spend millions to improve their housing 
conditions? 
  As we know, the new constitution of the Russian Federation 
grants only our right to have a roof over our heads instead of 
the traditional state "guarantee" of housing for all of us. And 
achieving this now depends only on the individual himself, or 
more more precisely, on his wallet. And that is sad. Half of our 
society is made up of persons unable to work (pensioners, young 
people, the disabled, and children), who receive fixed 
allowances, compensatory payments, and stipends which are far 
below the subsistence minimum. It is clear that the market in 
the housing field means they are completely deprived of civil 
rights and even further dependent on the local budget. But if we 
are reminded that there is never any money in the budget as it 
is, it is not at all clear how the new order for providing 
social housing will function. 
  The state of affairs with respect to provision of housing 
for 
the 60 million able-bodied citizens is even less clear. The most 
pressing question is: will the state's "housing debt" be paid to 
them? After all, the line in which over 10 million families have 
"stood" for many years has completely lost its outlines (vague 
as they were). And the mechanism for ordinary employees of 
"ordinary" enterprises to purchase housing on the market is 
completely inaccessible. 
  In the transition to the market, the housing problem is just 
as severe as the wage and employment problems. However, the 
latter have counterparts in the economy of Western countries, 
but the housing problem has the features of a purely Soviet 
phenomenon. In this connection, I believe we need to single out 
several key factors and define them more specifically in a new 
housing policy. Unless the reformers want restructuring of the 
housing field to become an additional catalyst for social 
instability, of course... 
  First of all, in defining the overall economic mechanism for 
stabilization, we cannot overlook the gradual expansion of 
housing construction. Naturally, this is possible only with 
wide-scale state protectionism. Secondly, we need to maintain 
state levers for regulating the housing market. A policy of 
"shock" privatization of housing facilities is unacceptable. And 
thirdly, discontinuation of state subsidies for housing and 
payment for communal services should take place together with an 
appropriate review of the tax system and a change in the 
structure of a minimum consumer budget. 
  I would like to discuss these key problms in a little more 
detail. 
  The average housing per citizen is 16 square meters of total 
space, which is somewhat less than that stipulated by the 
Housing Code of the RSFSR--18 square meters. The housing problem 
in Russia is burdened by the fact that more than 30 million 
square meters of housing are located in dilapidated and damaged 
structures. With the volumes of construction being forecast, it 
is not hard to draw the conclusion that there are no prospects 
for improvement in the situation. 
  The shock increase of 100 times the cost of housing and 
everyday services outlined by the government program deprives 
persons on the waiting list of the opportunity to acquire an 
apartment under the conditions stipulated by the RSFSR Law "On 
privatization of available housing in the RSFSR." Most of the 
people simply will not have the funds needed to purchase housing 
over the next 10 years. 
  There has been a decline in the volume of financing for 
housing construction from all sources. The government has 
practically relieved itself of this unpleasant business. The 
situation that has taken shape has paralyzed movement of the 
line for improved housing conditions, first of all. The FITUR's 
proposals to conclude a General Agreement on Additional 
Commitments for Housing Construction have not been supported in 
the Russian Federation Government and were not put into a 
document. 
  The situation with respect to development of house-building 
cooperatives and individual builders is no better. There has 
been three times as much recession here. In the economic 
sitation that has taken shape, shifting the concern about 
housing to the people's shoulders will not be able to stimulate 
new construction over the next 10 years, since the population 
has a single problem--survival. 
  A new source of financing for housing construction has made 
its appearance over the past 2 years--so-called commercial and 
shareholding organizations. It is being practically doubled each 
year, but its proportion, as before, is not high (25 to 30 
percent). 
  As of the beginning of this year, 10 million families were 
on 
the waiting list to receive housing. Almost one-third of them 
are living in communal apartments, dormitory facilities, and 
dilapidated and damaged structures; many have been waiting to 
receive housing for over 10 years. 
  With the existing level of housing provided for the public 
and the condition of the economy, we cannot manage without 
direct assistance from the state budget and other centralized 
sources. 
  The housing market being formed under government supervision 
has become a factor in the workers' deteriorating housing 
conditions and has sharply stepped up both economic and social 
tension. I think that housing reform should be coordinated 
without delay with all elements of social policy (primarily with 
the policy of incomes and the living standard, and with the 
employment policy and directed social support for disadvantaged 
citizens) and subordinated to the goals of providing for the 
priority constitutional rights of the individual--to housing and 
property and a fitting standard of living. But the current 
housing policy is openly subordinated to a single, purely 
economic interest--relieving the state budget of what is left of 
elementary social guarantees.

<F P=106> [Report by F. Ilyukhin: "37,000 Casualties! It Is Terrible"] </F>
  [Text] In commenting on the accidents statistics for the 
first 6 months of last year (ZA RULEM No 11, 1993), we predicted 
that the annual total would differ little from 1992, a year with 
a high accident rate. Unfortunately, this prediction was 
generally correct. 
  Despite the fact that the number of DTP [traffic accidents] 
in 1993 dropped by 3.7 percent compared with 1992 and there were 
3.9 percent fewer persons injured in accidents, the principal 
and most alarming indicator--the number of casualties--rose by 
1.5 percent. 
  More than 37,000 persons were killed on Russian roads, 100 
people per day. You remember how the country was shaken last 
December by the aircraft disaster over Irkutsk, where about 120 
passengers and crew members were killed. But there are almost as 
many here every day, and there is no public reaction. This is 
the kind of dangerous magic involved in large figures. 
  The steady increase in severity of the consequences of 
accidents (with a decrease in the number of accidents) attests 
to the fact that they are becoming bloodier. The reason for this 
often is unregulated high speed, poor roads, and the 
disgustingly poor condition of the vehicles. 
  All the same, in grieving about casualties on the roads last 
year, let us not pass over the positive trends which provide at 
least a little hope. The number of accidents and the number of 
persons killed and injured by drunk drivers have declined (by 
5.5, 3.7, and 3.5 percent, respectively). The accident rate 
involving the transport facilities of enterprises and 
organizations has decreased. The number of accidents here 
declined by 14 percent, and the number of persons killed and 
injured decreased by 13 and 14.9 percent. Though we should not 
boast too much about this--the fleet of motor vehicles which 
belong to so-called juridical entities has been reduced, as we 
know. And one more positive result--fewer children have been hit 
by vehicles than in 1992. 
  In one of the commentaries on accident rate statistics 
published in the journal, they were compared with a pendulum, 
because there is no assurance that individual indicators which 
declined last year will not increase in the following year. 
There is no such assurance now, either, since there is no 
unified highway traffic safety system in Russia--it has not been 
created yet. There is no law on road traffic, although it has 
been drafted, but it was not moved for almost a year in the 
former VS [Supreme Soviet]. Perhaps the new parliament will find 
the time for it, and devote its attention to one of the most 
important social problems of our time.

  [Text] The complexity of the transport situation 
which has formed on Russian territory was impressively 
elucidated at the Applied Science Conference of the RF Academy 
of Transport, which was held in September 1992, with 
international participation. The content of the basic reports 
and speeches, however, went beyond the framework of simply 
informing the transport community of the state of affairs on 
Russian railways. Proposals on the directions for development of 
the Federation's transport system and on the concept for drawing 
up the "Transport Rossii" [Russian Transport] Program and the 
principles on which it should be based were advanced at the same 
time. 
  A considerable place was devoted to scientific support of 
developments, and the new demands which our transport policy 
must meet under market conditions were formulated. The main 
report rejected the principle of the "primacy of means of 
transport," which transfers the center of gravity from the 
organization of a commodity-producing system as a whole and its 
infrastructure to selection of the methods for operating rolling 
stock for each individual form of transport. It was noted that 
today we need specialists, thinking in general transport terms, 
without whom we cannot form an efficient commodity- and 
passenger-carrying system for the Russian Federation. 
  The rates of development of the comprehensive state program, 
"Transport Rossii," in which the Academy of Transport is 
assigned a prominent place, are picking up. The first stage of 
development is essentially completed. About 50 scientists and 
experts from abroad took part in it, and forces and resources of 
the International Monetary Fund were drawn in. One of the 
reports noted that in the past the Union "had never had programs 
like this, it was being done for the first time." In reality, 
perhaps, our country had not had such an accompaniment for a 
sectorial national economic program since the 
mid-1920's-beginning of the 1930's, when it was considered the 
norm to draw in foreign specialists and resources. It is another 
question as to how effective this will be in modern-day Russia. 
After all, our scientific potential is fully adequate for us to 
cope with any task ourselves. The mechanical transfer of Western 
experience to domestic soil is particularly inadmissible. 
  Another general aim, based on principle, and expressed at 
the 
conference, was the need to provide the program with a reliable 
foundation -- scientifically verified ideology, which should be 
incorporated into the basis of Russia's transport system. This 
will be our topic below, and moreover, our main attention will 
be paid only to problems and questions which remain in the 
background, but are of decisive importance for the development 
of Russia's transport system. 
<H5>  Analysis of the Problematic Situation </H5>
  It is impossible to determine the strategic and tactical 
goals correctly, and to formulate Russia's transport policy, 
without objectively evaluating the situation which has formed. 
The destruction of the unified political space inevitably led to 
the dismemberment of the country's economic wholeness and a 
breakdown of the traditional transport-economic ties. In 
evaluating the general course of the process of disintegration 
of the USSR transport system, the results of this process, 
condensed to the maximum, can be characterized in a single word 
-- degradation -- which has encompassed almost the entire 
transport industry of all the former Union republics, including 
Russia. 
  Russia's sacrifice in favor of the other republics was 
obvious, constant and significant in former years, but is not 
appreciated to this day. Russia was regularly allotted too low a 
volume of supplies of transport funds and material-technical 
resources. With respect to the density of the railroad network 
(about 5 km per 1,000 km[.sup]2[/] of territory), Russia gave 
way to many of the former Union republics --Ukraine (38 km), 
Belarus (27 km), Kazakhstan (5.4 km), Uzbekistan (7.8 km). 
Russia also found itself in last place with respect to density 
of paved roads (about 23 km per 1,000 km[.sup]2[/] of 
territory). Right now it has only about 460,000 km of these 
roads, while the total need for them is estimated as 2.5 million 
km. 
  On the whole for Russian transport, the volume of freight 
conveyance in 1992 was reduced by 20 percent, including river -- 
by 37 percent and air -- by 40 percent, as compared with 1991. 
In the last few years the development of the transport network 
has slowed down, as is evidenced by the data in Table 1.

  In 1992 the transport construction volume was cut back 
sharply. In 9 months of 1992, of the planned 90 km of new 
railroad lines for the Russian Ministry of Railways, not a 
single kilometer was put into operation. Only 40 km of second 
tracks were turned over for operation, instead of 208 km. In 
January-September 1992, 2,900 km of paved highways for general 
use were built, as against 5,900 km in the same period of 1991 
and, respectively, 25 km as against 87 km of main petroleum 
products pipelines. No main oil pipelines were put into 
operation in this period (in 9 months of 1991, 705 km of them 
were put into operation). The unsatisfactory state of many of 
the railways creates emergency situations, leading to losses 
during transport and a reduction in the speed of freight 
delivery. 
  Railroad transport. The railroads of the Russian 
MPS have an increasing number of defective rails and rails that 
have worked out their service life laid on their tracks. The 
extent of main tracks using these rails has reached respectively 
11,000 km (9 percent of the total extent) and 22,000 km (18 
percent). Some 22,000 defective switches and 23,000 defective 
crossings (11 percent of their total number) are in operation on 
the tracks. 
  There is an urgent need to replace R-65 rails on the most 
freight-intensive roads, which account for 83 percent of the 
developed length of main tracks in Russia, with the stronger 
R-75 rails. Only 4 percent of the main tracks have rails of this 
type at present, and such freight-intensive roads as the 
Sverdlovsk, East Siberian and Transbaykal have no R-75 rails at 
all. 
  The deterioration in the state of the track on the railroads 
stems to a considerable extent from the double or triple cutback 
in supplies of rails, ties and other permanent way elements. The 
main reason for the nonfulfillment of the schedules for supply 
of materials for the permanent way tracks is the railroads' 
shortage of funds to settle with the suppliers. The price of 
rails, ties and sets of switch ties rose by a factor of 35-50 as 
compared with 1991, and of sets of switch assemblies -- by a 
factor of 160. 
  Because of the poor state of the track, the roads have been 
forced to introduce speed restrictions for train traffic on a 
number of sections. According to the condition on 20 November 
1992, on sections 8,000 km long, 5,500 speed restriction 
warnings were in effect, and of them, 1,500 were not provided 
for by the traffic schedule. 
  Motor vehicle transport. The highway network of 
the Russian Federation is inferior in all indicators, not only 
to the leading foreign countries, but also to the former Union 
republics. According to the data of the Motor Vehicle Transport 
Department, only 10-12 percent of the trucks and buses for 
general use from the motor vehicle fleet of the former USSR were 
left on Russian territory. 
  Over 40 percent of Russia's rural population centers have no 
connections with the network of routes for general use. The 
situation is particularly critical in Yaroslavl Oblast, where 
only 17 percent of the rural population centers have this 
connection. The situation is analogous in Tver, Kostroma, Orlov, 
Kursk, Volgograd, Omsk and Tyumen oblasts and the republics of 
Mari El, Mordovia, Chuvashia, Kalmykia, Khalmg-Tangch and Tuva, 
where no more than [sic] half of these population centers are 
located. 
  The quality of the highway network for general use is not 
good: 11 percent of the highways are dirt roads, which become 
virtually impassable in the fall and winter. Over one-third of 
the paved roads are gravel, crushed rock, slag and cobblestone, 
which do not meet the technical norms, traffic intensity or 
loads of today's means of transport. The poor quality of the 
road pavement and its tendency to wear rapidly make frequent 
highway repair necessary. A cutback in the repair work volume 
has recently begun, however (Table 2).

  River transport. By the beginning of 1992, the 
extent of inland waterways served by Rosrechflot had dropped by 
3,400 km, or by 3.2 percent, as compared with the beginning of 
1986. The length of the navigable inland waterways was greatly 
reduced (by 5.5 percent). The extent of waterways with 
guaranteed depths has also dropped somewhat. The reason for this 
is the lack of demand for certain sections of the waterways, 
mainly on small rivers, because of the reduction in the volumes 
of cargo and passenger transport. 
  By the beginning of this year, there were 2,600 mooring 
places in Russia with the total extent of the mooring front 
being 182,200 linear m, of which shipping company cargo berths 
account for 58 percent. The total extent of the cargo berths is 
tending toward reduction: it has dropped by 2 percent as 
compared with 1986. This is because some of the obsolete wooden 
berths have been taken out of operation. The length of the 
berths equipped with transhipping equipment, was reduced by 
1,300 linear m during this period, which is because of the sharp 
drop (by 65-70 percent of the 1986 level) in freight conveyance 
by river transport and dismantling of the transshipment 
equipment from inactive berths. 
  Maritime transport.Thirty-nine seaports and 22 
port centers with a total mooring front length of 60,500 linear 
m, which constitutes about 50 percent of the length of the 
berths in the former Union, are located on Russian territory. 
The production capacity of the Russian ports is estimated at 187 
million t (42 percent of the capacity of the USSR ports) and 
provides only 54 percent of the need for cargo handling. The 
rest of Russia's export-import cargo is handled at ports of the 
Baltic countries, Ukraine, Georgia and Azerbaijan. At the same 
time, Russian ports transship about 13 million t of the 
contiguous states' cargo. 
  The berths are equipped with 216 transshipping complexes for 
dry cargo and 26 complexes to handle bulk cargo, which is 
respectively 45 and 40 percent of the transshipping complexes of 
the former Union. With the break-up of the USSR, Russia was 
deprived of modern complexes to transship potassium salt, 
petroleum cargo and liquefied gas, and was left without railroad 
ferries to Germany and Bulgaria. Today the country has only one 
portside elevator to accept imported grain and one specialized 
complex to transship imported raw sugar. 
  The port industry must be developed and modernized. About 60 
percent of Russian ports are unable to accept modern large ships 
because the berths are not deep enough. Over one-fourth of the 
berth front and fenced-in structures are in an unsatisfactory 
technical condition. No new transshipping complexes for seaports 
were envisaged or being put into operation in 1989-1991. 
  The structure of the transport fleet is extremely 
inefficient. It includes only 27 percent of all the reefer 
ships, 29 percent of the grain carriers, 18 percent of the 
ferries, 25 percent of the LASH ships and 35 percent of the 
passenger ships of the former USSR Ministry of the Maritime 
Fleet. 
  Air transport. The former Aeroflot, one of the 
world's major air associations, no longer exists. It has been 
broken up into dozens of small companies. The Russian Aeroflot, 
which was an international carrier, transported 3 million 
passengers in 1992 (or 700,000 fewer than in 1991), including 
500,000 passengers by charter flights. The shipment of cargo by 
this air company's planes increased from 54,000 t (1991) to 
75,000 t (1992). The technical strength of the ground base is 
about 60 percent of the normative level, and not over 50 percent 
with respect to air terminal complexes. The wear and tear on the 
fixed capital in air transport was particularly high and reached 
70 percent. 
  An objective analysis of the above figures leaves no doubt 
that the first and main task of the "Transport Rossii" Program 
being worked out should be to re-establish the Federation's 
transport potential at today's scientific-technical level. This 
urgent task should be given priority over other tasks and plans 
for transport newbuildings, including the construction of 
high-speed railroad lines, construction of new seaports, 
superhighways through uninhabited or sparsely inhabited regions, 
etc. 
<H5>  Does the Russian Federation Need an ETS [Unified Transport </H5>
System] 
  The answer to this question seemed to be provided at the 
above-mentioned applied science conference, and this answer was 
absolutely affirmative. The "Transport Rossii" Program should be 
worked out as a unified, objective-oriented complex, 
encompassing the entire Russian territory, all levels of 
management, including regional, and all forms of transport 
(although the problems of municipal and industrial-technological 
transport, it appears, have been dropped from this complex). 
  The unification of Russia's transport system, however, 
should 
not mean cutting it off from the routes of the neighboring CIS 
territories. Another question arises in connection with this: 
can Russia work out a realistic program for its transport 
development without the participation in it of its closest 
neighbors, with whom its transport network (for example, 
railroad) has been (and continues to be) in unity, not just 
formally, but in actuality, for the last one-and-a-half 
centuries and more? 
  The problem of forming a unified Russian transport system, 
with a narrow, and therefore erroneous, conception of it, would 
signify the destruction of the super-national, "trans-boundary" 
unity of the railroad network, which in reality does exist. The 
overall nature of the "Transport Rossii" Program, therefore, 
gains yet another dimension, the weightiness of which is 
determined by the fates of the CIS. Neither rapid nor slow 
disintegration of the CIS is advantageous to Russia's transport 
workers, and the most farsighted politicians and managers, 
fortunately, realize this. 
  Economic isolation inevitably leads to the creation of 
differentiated transport markets, stagnation in the sphere of 
technical progress as a whole and a reduction in the efficiency 
transport use. The experience of the West European countries in 
particular convinces one of this. The Common Market countries, 
for example, due to isolationism in the transport policy at the 
end of the 1980's lost about 400 billion Marks yearly. According 
to calculations made by German scholars in connection with the 
intention to create a unified European market in 1993, as N.S. 
Konarev informed us in his report at the conference, the Common 
Market countries are losing over 15 billion Marks a year at 
border crossings. The average speed of freight delivery, from 
Belgium to Greece, for example, is only 12 km/hr, because of all 
the border procedures that have to be performed. At the same 
time, with the creation of a unified European market, all the 
border formalities will become unnecessary and the delivery 
speeds should sharply rise. 
  Making a realistic and considered evaluation of the 
advantages of transport integration, Kazakhstan, for example, is 
consistently following the policy of strengthening cooperation 
with Russia, within the framework of the CIS, and on a bilateral 
basis as well. In an interview for the newspaper GUDOK (No 21 of 
4 February 1993), N.K. Isingarin, minister of Transport for the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, spoke with understandable anxiety about 
the "rolling wave of technical and technological lagging behind 
in the development of railroad transport on almost all the 
railroads of the Commonwealth".... In order to avoid this 
danger, the director of Kazakhstan transport feels, it is 
advisable to "think up variants for the future development of 
the railroads." The conclusion is fully justified, and one 
cannot help but heed it when working out the "Transport Rossii" 
Program. The experienced engineer, scientist and director looks 
even farther: "Kazakhstan is prepared for the Russian MPS, based 
on its scientific potential, to boldly dictate, with their 
instructions and recommendations, the policy for the development 
of the railroads." 
  Unfortunately, not everyone can see the advantages of this 
cooperation for Russia. Some people think that by isolating 
itself, Russia will gain the possibility of radically improving 
its socio-economic situation. It needs at least in some way to 
compensate for the loss of time and pace, to be determined, 
finally, in its domestic and foreign policy, to concentrate on 
solving its own problems and to obtain a legal freedom of 
actions, not just of appeals and declarations. Russian transport 
will lose scarcely anything from the break-up of the CIS --they 
think. Right now the unified transport system of the CIS 
countries exists only in name. To preserve the visible, 
displayed unity of the CIS, Russia will, as before, have to pay 
in some way, and some mercenary-minded partners throughout the 
commonwealth wish to obtain quite a large payment. Is it not 
better to let them experience and comprehend, and quickly, all 
the disadvantages of living in discord? 
  After all, though, the isolation of Russia's transport 
system, isolation consolidated in an individually worked out 
program, and the additional political erosion of its 
administrative-territorial structure, whether we like it or not, 
will lead to a loss of its status as a great power. Then the 
unenviable role of a raw material appendage to the "civilized" 
states awaits the country, naturally, with all the attributes of 
such a condition -- overwhelming poverty of part of the 
population, economic dependence on the outside world, and 
political instability. This course of events will become reality 
unless the CIS countries (first and foremost Russia) display 
political wisdom and a will to true cooperation. 
  Strengthening the Commonwealth is the best of the possible 
outcomes, and should be achieved, but not at the price of 
endless economic and political concessions on Russia's part. 
There is always a dominant in any system, and Russia is this 
dominant in the CIS. Acknowledging its natural supremacy (just 
as in the West, the United States is the generally acknowledged 
dominant) and authority is an indispensable condition for the 
existence of a unified transport area. 
  Preserving and strengthening the commonwealth of former 
Union 
republics, even if this process takes several years, may prove 
to be the salvation of both Russia and the other CIS countries. 
A unified economic and transport area is preserved, and the 
re-establishment of the declining transport communications will 
take considerably less time and fewer material, labor and 
financial resources. The political disagreements related to 
establishing interstate boundaries will be smoothed over, the 
conflicts about the distribution of means of transport among 
republics which only recently lived as a unified family will be 
alleviated, and the chance of making the transition from the 
eight-year-long destructive phase of reforms to its creative 
phase will be promoted. 
  Unfortunately, some republics were in a hurry to give up the 
idea of Russia's natural supremacy in the commonwealth of 
independent states, which did not prevent them from finding an 
"older brother" in the far abroad. The existing transport 
infrastructure, however, was quite conservative, and it will not 
be easy for these republics to quickly reorient their 
transport-economic ties toward new partners, passing over Russia. 
  At the stage of programming the development of transport, 
Russia should not rule out the participation of the former CEMA 
member countries, and even the European Community (EC) in its 
transport structures. It is very unlikely, however, that there 
will be a major breakthrough on this level of cooperation in the 
near future, although such interaction in solving individual 
problems is possible right now. In the final analysis, a great 
deal will be determined by the foreign policy goals of the new 
Russia, but the decisive factor is the domestic socio-economic 
policy. 
<H5>  Questions of State Importance </H5>
  In the program being worked out, the following extremely 
important questions must be given a precise answer: 
  The first of them: will efforts be continued to 
ensure the unity of the transport system, not only on the scale 
of Russia, but also beyond its limits, on the level of each form 
of transport? 
  In solving this problem, it seems that only railroad 
transport was precisely determined: the MPS of the Russian 
Federation virtually took on the coordination of railroad 
service on the entire territory occupied by the Soviet Union 
until the end of 1991. Considering the specific nature of 
railroad work, to examine and approve the basic statutes 
ensuring stable transport service for the national economy and 
the people under the conditions of a market economy, a Council 
for Railroad Transport was set up as the highest authority for 
coordinating the work of the railroads and its permanent 
executive body -- the Board of Directors. Agreements on the 
basic principles of the operational work of the CIS railroads, 
on the procedure for transit, on dividing up the railcar and 
container fleets, and other important decisions were made. 
  The property of the Soviet railroads, marine and other forms 
of transport as a whole, however, was essentially divided up 
among the sovereign republics "on the spur of the moment," 
virtually by self-usurpation. Russia, as was noted, lost exits 
to the largest and technically best-equipped seaports and was 
deprived of its share in the capacities of the railcar building, 
locomotive building and shipbuilding enterprises. Air transport 
suffered tremendous losses. The transport repair base was 
unevenly distributed among the CIS countries. For example, in 
the sphere of capital repair of freight cars, Russia has a 
13,400 deficit of boxcars, Ukraine has a surplus of 5,700, 
Kazakhstan a deficit of 2,700 cars a year, Armenia has no such 
base at all, etc. 
  In working out the "Transport Rossii" Program, which has 
gained the status of a state program, one must not let this very 
acute problem go unheeded. In this respect, the program can be 
neither deideologized nor depoliticized. One cannot agree with 
the point of view of those who judge according to a "no use 
crying over spilt milk" scheme. This problem must be solved on a 
fair, strictly scientific, state basis. 
  The riches accumulated by our fraternal nations should not 
be 
let go after the destruction of their common home, but should 
unite the people and the economy of the CIS countries. There are 
opportunities for this, and we must time and time again go back 
to the problem of dividing up the transport production 
capacities, which deserve individual, unhurried, thoughtful 
consideration. We need solutions which will make it possible to 
make joint use of the transport capacities created in the past 
for a direct purpose. "We must decisively prohibit the 
overproliferation of production facilities. Everyone will gain 
from this in the long run." This point of view, expressed by 
N.S. Konarev in the course of discussing the program at the 
conference, gives true guidelines to its developers. 
  The task of dividing up the transport capacities should be 
achieved in consideration of the fact that, for example, in the 
years of the early five-year plans, over 50 percent of the 
transport newbuilding sites were located outside Russia's 
limits. About 4,000 km of railroads were turned over for 
operation on the territory of Kazakhstan alone in those years, 
which almost tripled the extent of its railroad network. The 
capital of Tajikistan was joined to the railroads of the 
country, and the networks of Azerbaijan (Mindzhevan-Alyat line) 
and other republics were intensified. 
  The tendency toward outstripping development of the 
transport 
network outside the territory of the Russian Federation was 
maintained in the postwar years. Of the railroads built in the 
period from 1945 to 1975, 40 percent of their total extent fell 
to Kazakhstan, Central Asia, the Caucasus and the Transcaucasus. 
As a result, by the beginning of the 1980's, the railroad 
network of Kazakhstan, for example, approached 15,000 km and 
constituted 10 percent of the total operational extent of the 
Union's railroads, whereas in 1913 it was not over 2,700 km (4 
percent of the extent of Russia's railroad network at that 
time). In the postwar years, new mainlines were built on the 
territory of Turkmenia and Uzbekistan (the 1,000-kilometer 
Chardzhou-Kungrad-Beyneu line), Tajikistan and other republics. 
Tens of billions of rubles were allotted from the Union budget 
for the construction of these lines and other facilities. The 
time has come for these assets to be fairly "divided up," 
meaning by this, the right of joint use of the common production 
capacities of each republic in a certain proportion. 
  The Second question: how will Russian transport 
participate, in the coming difficult stage of development of our 
multi-ethnic republic, in achieving the most important all-state 
tasks? 
  As before, the agrarian problem is one of these tasks. There 
is little determination of the agrarian sector's need for 
transport and expression of this need in additional transport 
production capacities. We must have a well thought out system of 
transport provision for the rural area, guaranteeing the success 
of Russia's agrarian policy. 
  It is not clear what will compensate for the closing down of 
unprofitable and low-activity stations and lines serving the 
rural hinterlands. Many rural towns and villages that have been 
abandoned will undoubtedly be rehabilitated and inhabited. We 
must seriously think about how transport will support the new 
agrarian policy and will contribute to the revival of spiritual 
and economic life on the vast expanses of Russia. We also need a 
clear-cut stand on problems of developing ecologically pure 
electric transport and reducing the adverse effect of transport 
and road construction on the natural environment and man. 
  One of the most important socio-economic tasks for all types 
of transport should be provision of passenger transport in large 
cities and urban agglomerations. All the countries of the world 
are intensively seeking to accomplish this task, but it is not 
even designated in the plans for development of Russian 
transport. One cannot count on the way this was done in the 
past, by widescale construction of subways: that requires 
tremendous expenditures. The problem is insoluble without rail 
transport. 
  As studies of the transport laboratory of the State 
Management Academy imeni S. Ordzhonikidze showed, in many large 
Russian cities (Nizhnyy Novgorod, Volgograd, Samara, Ufa, Perm, 
Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, etc.), railroad lines with an extent 
of 35-40 km and more run within the city boundary, connecting 
the peripheral areas of the city with its central section. These 
mainline intra-junction routes, radially approaching the cities 
and intersecting the urban sites being built up, have gradually 
"grown into" the city structure. Now, however, these lines are 
used mainly for freight transport, and only partially for 
suburban and intra-city passenger service. In the future there 
will be an opportunity to create, on the basis of these 
intra-junction lines, highly efficient systems of surface rail 
transport, to radically improve the quality of suburban 
passenger transport and to make through trips in the 
"city-suburbs" zone. 
  Transit and local (intra-junction) freight transport must be 
gradually carried out to by-pass junctions or other parallel 
intra-junction connections, using the lines thus freed mainly 
for passenger traffic. This would make it possible to solve 
several problems at once. In the first place, to release here 
the throughput capacity of the railroads located in the city for 
more intensive suburban and, especially important, urban 
passenger transport, to assist traditional types of city 
transport. In the second place, it will make it possible to 
reduce dust pollution of the air basin and city territory, and 
lower the level of transport noise and vibration. In the third 
place, the cardinal point, the problem of the throughput 
capacity of the most important railroad junctions and the 
reserve of production capacities and capital investments in the 
development of transport will be solved for many years ahead. 
  Mainlining transport on the basis of electrified surface 
railroads will make it possible in practice to begin developing 
unified networks of rail transport in Russia's large cities and 
to organize through service between the city and its suburbs by 
more economical methods. 
  It is expedient to begin realizing this task in the next few 
years. Particularly needed for this are: evaluating the 
possibility and expediency of more complete use of surface 
railroads for the needs of the population, on the basis of 
inspecting the rail transport networks in large Russian cities 
(first stage); intensifying research which will make it possible 
to determine the conditions and sphere of use of surface 
electrified railroads in Russian cities, for organization of 
intra-urban and suburban transport, and will also make it 
possible to evaluate the socio-economic effectiveness of these 
roads (second stage). 
  The RF MPS has already begun research in this sphere, and 
its 
results should be incorporated in the "Transport Rossii" 
Program. This will make it possible to draw up proposals and 
begin the radical rebuilding of rail transport for the large 
cities of Russia. 
  The third question: what should be the state 
policy in developing technical means of transport, including the 
entire complex of devices and structures ensuring the normal 
operation of the railways? 
  Here, in particular, we must make clear whether nuclear 
power 
for transport should be further developed and if it should, then 
on what scale and in which regions of the country. 
  The prospects for further electrification of transport as a 
whole, and of railroads in particular, must be outlined. The 
main heavily traveled railroad mainlines have already been 
electrified. What principles will be incorporated in choosing 
the sections subject to further electrification and on what 
energy-carrier and traction parameters it will be reckoned 
remain unclear. 
  The problem of selecting the weight and speed of the rolling 
stock units, particularly in railroad transport, should be 
solved on the basis of a whole group of present-day 
socio-economic and ecological requirements. So far there are 
virtually no substantiated decisions in the sphere of efficient 
methods of raising the transport potential of the railways. 
  The fourth question: will Russian transport take 
real steps toward intercooperation among forms of transport and 
also among related sectors of the national economy? 
  The transition of transport, particularly railroads, to 
market relations is not simple and not easy. It is, however -- 
today's reality, and is not being solved by the tariff policy 
alone. Transport should be more actively included in 
intersectorial cooperation (integration), but this does not even 
exist within transport itself (between the forms of it), not to 
mention cooperation with industry, agriculture, etc. Meanwhile, 
the tasks of improving transport administration as a whole and 
of ensuring efficient interaction between forms of transport in 
passenger and freight conveyance (development of transshipping 
junctions, construction of combined terminals, etc.) have now 
become even more urgent than they were two or three years ago. 
  The main principle incorporated into the basis for 
development of Russian transport in the past was the idea of the 
wholeness of the country's transport-road complex, the 
centralization of management and the creation of super-large 
transport monopolies. In the course of one-and-a-half centuries 
and more, a unique transport structure of the monocentric type, 
based on state ownership, formed on the territory of Russia. 
This historical fact is of great importance in practical work. 
Powerful, but insufficiently flexible, this structure today is 
not in a position to satisfy fully all the requirements of a 
market economy. The objective necessity and possibility have 
arisen of increasing the efficiency and improving the quality of 
transport work, by supplementing it with a network of 
small-scale and medium-scale business enterprises. 
  Any market is hard to control, particularly at the stage of 
coming into being and in the absence of the necessary 
regulators. The point is not only this, though. An efficient 
transition to a market is possible on condition that a surplus 
of commodities and services is available (or may be ensured in a 
very short time). Only in this case will competition ensure the 
normal action of market regulators. 
  Some forms of transport and categories of enterprises 
possess 
the characteristics of a natural monopoly. Even in capitalist 
countries (Germany, France and, until recently, Japan), the 
railroads essentially find themselves outside the market, 
regularly receiving billions in subsidies from the state budget. 
Competition does exist in them, though, since the production 
capacities of state and private railroads have accumulated there 
in the course of one-and-a-half centuries and today cover the 
real demand for transport by a factor of two to three. 
  It is a different matter in our country. The need for 
transport in our homeland is potentially tremendous, and there 
can be no question of a surplus of transport products of the 
proper quality in the next few years. The development of 
small-scale and medium-scale business enterprises would make 
possible a noticeable reduction in the gap between demand and 
supply of transport products and services. 
  By the beginning of the 1990's, there were three segments of 
small-scale and medium-scale transport business in the Russian 
Federation: state, leased and private. The sphere of 
entrepreneurship continues to expand, although the volume of 
conveyance by mainline forms of transport, as compared with 
1985, was cut at least in half and continues to drop. The 
development of small-scale and medium-scale transport business 
is connected not so much with transport work (this mainly 
relates to railroad transport, which occupies the dominating 
position in Russia's transport system) as with 
transport-dispatch service for the population and customers, 
performance of loading-unloading work and freight-sorting 
operations, and also with activity in the sphere of repair and 
service of means of transport and hoisting-transporting 
equipment. 
  In the first quarter of 1993 in Russia, there were over 300 
privatized motor vehicle transport enterprises, about 150 air 
companies, and approximately 130 water transport enterprises 
with several hundred ships. Private persons and cooperatives 
became owners of over 122,000 trucks and over 11,000 motorbuses. 
  Despite the growth of entrepreneurship in Russia's 
transport, 
its scale looks modest as compared with other sectors of the 
country's economy. This is not only because of the corresponding 
instructions of the RF Goskomimushchestvo, issued in the autumn 
of 1992 and in January of 1993 (as we know, they specify a 
special procedure for privatization in transport and do not 
permit turning the transport infrastructure over to private 
ownership), but also because of a number of other economic, 
legal and organizational reasons. These reasons include the 
slump in production and the reduction in demand for the 
transport of freight and passengers, the rise in prices for 
means of transport, fuel and spare parts, the imperfection of 
the legal base and undeveloped nature of the mechanism for state 
regulation and support of entrepreneurship. 
  It appears that, with the elimination of these reasons, 
small-scale and medium-scale business in Russian transport can 
accelerate its development. The correct choice of their spheres 
of activity on the transport market will contribute to this. In 
our opinion, these spheres are: delivering passengers and small 
consignments of freight to cities and suburban zones; technical 
service, repair of motor vehicles and the offering of a full 
range of services on the country's main highways; 
transport-dispatch service for the population and for 
enterprises of various forms of ownership; setting up 
small-scale and medium-scale transport firms on low-activity 
railroads and at stations, marine and river ports, and 
industrial transport enterprises; setting up intersectorial 
transport firms which complete the transport process in mixed 
service and at the "customer-transport" juncture; fulfilling the 
orders of major transport enterprises in the sphere of 
subsidiary-ancillary activity. 
  The choice of these directions in the development of 
small-scale and medium-scale business is substantiated: it 
promises a true improvement in the quality of transport service. 
There are over 1,400 cities in Russia with a population of from 
50,000 to 250,000 persons, in which it is expedient to carry out 
regular transport of passengers and small consignments of 
freight, which is unprofitable for enterprises of the state 
sector. Despite the creation of a network of company-serviced 
centers, almost 8 million private owners of motor vehicles 
cannot satisfy their need for technical service and repair of 
their vehicles. Even on Russia's main highways, there is no 
basic vehicle service, which makes normal operation of motor 
vehicles difficult. 
  As for the development of entrepreneurship on low-activity 
railroad lines and stations, Russia has over 3,300 km of lines 
and about 1,000 stations included in this category, the 
operation of which brings the roads large losses. 
Commercializing the work of these facilities on the basis of 
small-scale and medium-scale entrepreneurship can make them 
profitable. Positive changes can also be made at the juncture 
points of transport and customers, which so far remain a "no 
man's land," and also in the sphere of the subsidiary-ancillary 
activity of large transport enterprises. 
  Success in small-scale and medium-scale business in these 
spheres is impossible, however, without the support of the 
state, a point which should be reflected in the program for the 
development of Russia's transport. 
  The fifth question: what should be Russia's 
strategy and tactics in the sphere of transport when following a 
new regional and national policy? 
  The density of the road network and the quality of the 
transport service are different in different regions of the 
Russian Federation. In some autonomous republics, krays and 
oblasts, the trend toward isolation of transport and other 
sectors of the economy is intensifying. Therefore, using 
transport to integrate autonomies and other administrative 
subdivisions within the framework of the Russian Federation is a 
task of tremendous state importance. 
  The sixth question: On what principles will Russia 
be guided in the sphere of transport when implementing an 
investment policy and foreign economic relations? 
  First of all, effective general transport goals and scale of 
priorities must be worked out. The former theory of the 
effectiveness of capital investments is now inadequate as an 
answer to this question. Practical experience in solving 
specific economic problems will, as before, outstrip the theory. 
Moreover, the existing theory itself, on which the investment 
policy for transport was built, is in many ways obsolete. It is 
extremely important today, until there is a proper theoretical 
basis, to formulate, at least roughly, the general principles of 
the new investment policy in transport, just as it is important 
to work out a new approach to purchasing technical assets 
(ships, locomotives, railcars, other equipment) abroad. It must 
be determined using the prices for these products burdening the 
fixed production capital of all forms of domestic transport, 
deforming our domestic transport market and inhibiting progress 
in domestic machine building. 
  Since May of last year, the Ministry of Transport has been 
cooperating with the World Bank, discussing large-scale projects 
for the development of Russia's route network, with foreign 
capital drawn in. It is a question, in particular, of building 
highways in Siberia and the Far East with their subsequent 
connection, through Chukotka, the Bering Straits and Alaska, 
with the North American highway network. The project is, of 
course, a grand one, but its implementation would lay too heavy 
a burden on Russia's economy. It would also be useful to 
consider other projects of this type in the light of expediency 
and potentials of the economy. 
  As for drawing in foreign capital, Russia has a wealth of 
pre-revolutionary experience in this sphere, and should not 
forget about it. Many business people from abroad have worked in 
the field of transport construction in the country in their 
time. A large syndicate of French and Dutch bankers were the 
founders of the not unknown Main Society of Russian Railroads. 
It was famous not only for its successes in railroad 
construction, but also for large-scale financial machinations. 
The concession holders literally robbed the Russian treasury, 
and got rich on stock-exchange speculation with shares. Private 
companies would build railroads, and then operate them until 
redemption by the treasury -- primarily through funded loans 
abroad under government guarantee. This led to an influx of 
foreign capital, and moreover, the average profit norm for it 
was double or triple that in the countries of Western Europe. In 
this way, foreign capital elicited fabulous profits from the 
Russian treasury -- 3 billion gold rubles. 
  Now as never before it is useful to think over the words 
spoken by S.Yu. Witte a century ago: "Until Russian life works 
out its own national economy, based on the special individual 
features of Russian soil, until then we will be in the process 
of vacillating between various fashionable doctrines, falling 
for first one and then the other; until then we will hear from 
the same lips and read... logically incompatible judgments and 
projects; until then what was created yesterday will be 
considered bad tomorrow, and what is being created today is what 
was abolished yesterday; ... until then we will not have a 
correct economic existence, but will go along in the tow of 
foreign influences and all kinds of speculations, at the cost of 
national well-being." 
  In working out the "Transport Rossii" program, greater 
attention should be paid to its social guidelines and 
scientific-methodological basis. We will attempt to shed light 
on these important problems in the next issue of the 
journal. 
<H5>  [No 10, Oct 93 pp 7-10] </H5>
  [Text] 
<H5>  Social Guidelines </H5>
  It is difficult to present the "Transport Rossii" Program 
without social components. The human factor in transport is 
especially important: over 13 percent of the workers in the 
national economy are employed in the basic and "auxiliary" 
activity here. It is therefore impossible to separate the social 
policy in the Program from the economic policy. We will show 
this, using the example of railroad transport. 
  The key problems of the social development of the country's 
railroad transport were recently examined in detail at the 
network conference organized by the Economic Main Administration 
of the MPS and TsNIITEI [Central Scientific Information and 
Technical-Economic Research Institute] in May-June 1991. 
Representatives of the main administrations of the MPS, 
railroads and Central Trade Union Committee took part in the 
conference. The conference evaluated the general state of the 
social sphere of railroad transport, revealed its shortcomings 
and outlined ways to solve the two major, key problems -- wages 
and housing construction. Both these problems are closely 
connected with the general economic condition of the sector and 
prospects for its development under market conditions. 
  In the past two years, the situation in railroad transport 
has changed radically. In the first place, it does not have the 
object -- Soviet railroads as a unified whole -- for which 
social guidelines were worked out. In the second place, the 
slump in freight transport volumes continues, and under the 
conditions of hyperinflation, the tariff level lags behind the 
growth rates of expenditures for transport. This leads to a drop 
in the profitability of the roads and displacement of the 
emphases in the criteria for evaluating the efficiency of 
transport production, and makes achievement of the formerly 
outlined goals in social development of the roads become highly 
problematical. 
  Consequently, a correction must be made in the roads' 
economic policy and their social programs, with orientation 
toward the actual trends and prospects for development of market 
relations, both outside the sector (in the national economy as a 
whole) and within it (between individual roads and enterprises 
within the framework of the roads). The urgent need for the 
Russian Ministry of Railways to solve this problem is caused by 
two special features of the present day. The first one is the 
lack of a new mechanism for state regulation of the development 
and work of the sector on the macro-level (the old mechanism was 
almost completely destroyed, and the new one has not yet 
acquired precise outlines). The second feature is the 
uncertainty of the periods, paths, forms and methods of 
including the railroads in genuine market relations on the 
micro-level, by virtue of their production and social 
specificities (these relations are of a quasi-market nature 
right now). 
  In the new program, therefore, the question should, first 
and 
foremost, be that of working out the basic principles of the 
economic policy of the Russian Federation MPS as a basic sector 
of our national economy. Guided by this policy as a firm 
foundation, we can count on solving the social problems, bearing 
in mind the fact that railroad transport under our Russian 
conditions was and remains a sort of center of gravitation for 
the entire national economy. 
  The sector's economic policy should meet a number of 
requirements. They include: multi-dimensionality; striving for 
the quite distant future, giving as full consideration as 
possible to the special features of the present moment and the 
transitional period; balance. The last term means considering 
the sector as simultaneously the subject and the object of 
economic and social planning, implemented in a force field of 
action of state and market interests. 
  As the subject of the economic and social policy, Russian 
Federation railroad transport must first of all formulate its 
own main goals, tasks and preferences (priorities). They should 
be directed, on the one hand, toward satisfying the needs of 
other sectors of the national economy (including the state and 
private sector) and the population, and on the other hand -- 
toward providing for its own economic and social needs (economic 
growth and social guarantees). 
  As the object of the state's economic and social policy, 
railroad transport is interested in a scientifically 
substantiated and carefully worked out legislative base. The 
following should be regulated in it: the legal status of 
railroad transport, meaning its central position in Russia's 
transport infrastructure; financial relations with federal, 
republic and local budgets (price policy, taxes, benefits). 
  There are a number of other important questions, which are 
to 
be answered in the course of substantiating the economic and 
social policy of railroad transport. These questions include: 
combining different forms of ownership; the preference for 
freight transport (in its sectorial, territorial and other 
aspects); whether it is advisable (under what conditions is it 
advisable) to retain or expand tariff benefits for passenger 
transport on trains in long-distance and suburban service; who 
will cover the roads' losses from suburban transport, and how; 
will the state orders for transport and the conditions for 
performing this transport be maintained; on what principles will 
the sector's investment policy be based; the share participation 
of enterprises of the state, municipal and private sectors in 
new construction, expansion and re-equipment of the railroads, 
including electrification; the conditions for drawing in foreign 
capital (including the republics of the near abroad); the 
measures for social protection of railroad transport workers; 
whether it is advisable to maintain its own social structure 
(health care, national education and housing construction) and 
what will be the sources of its financing; whether the principle 
of extraterritoriality of the railroads will be preserved 
(boundaries of the effect of this principle). 
  Because of the transition to the market and the extreme 
disorder of the country's economy, the railroads may run into 
mass unemployment and the need for biological life support of 
the railroad workers and members of their families. The 
probability of this outcome remains high, and the number of 
urgent social problems is doubling: wages and housing in 1991; 
wages, housing, finding jobs and food supply -- in 1993. 
  Deserving special attention, therefore are: working out 
measures to support (increase) the profitability of 
unprofitable, but socially significant enterprises and types of 
activity; choosing the most effective forms and methods of 
diversifying the production capacities of railroad transport 
enterprises and organizations. These two practical tasks, which 
are vitally important, need thorough scientific substantiation. 
<H5>  The Scientific-Methodological Basis of the Program </H5>
  Laying the foundations of a national policy in the sphere of 
transport is a problem of tremendous practical importance, and 
such problems have no abstract, theoretical solution. 
Nevertheless, the construction of the program itself should be 
prefaced by basic scientific premises and certain theoretical 
elaborations. 
  In speaking of the theoretical support of the "Transport 
Rossii" Program, it should be acknowledged that in solving this 
problem we are still far from being in a position which could be 
considered fully satisfactory. The following convince us of 
this: the lack of a serious theoretical basis in studying 
Russian transport as an organized system on a state level; the 
lack of a unified information base, based on research carried 
out, unified initial prerequisites and unified methodology. As a 
result, there is today no complete scientific way out that is 
useful for the practical work of state planning. 
  Research on the program is carried out by scientific 
subdivisions in parallel and, essentially, independently of each 
other, which deprives the scientific product of any serious 
practical value. Substantiation of promising solutions to the 
problems of the transport network using models is produced "in 
fragments" for individual forms of transport. In this case, 
neither the special features of a market economy nor changes in 
the technology of the transport process, the organization of 
freight flows or the placement of transport junctions are 
properly taken into account. The positions of researchers on a 
certain specific question of the overall problem are determined 
primarily by experience accumulated in the past and by personal 
taste and inclinations. As before, a great deal is subordinated 
to low-content manipulation with models, formulas and 
algorithms, which often quite seriously, but not always 
noticeably, falsify transport reality, and substitute imaginary 
difficulties for real ones. 
  The history of science attests to the fact that a serious 
statement of scientific problems in ordinary language should 
precede their mathematical, formulaic expression. Models and 
model study may deepen our understanding of the nature of 
transport, but they cannot solve the practical problem of 
creating a highly efficient transport system. It is unreasonable 
and impractical to study the details without solving the main 
problems. This is precisely why the "Transport Rossii" Program 
needs a fundamental theoretical basis. The attempt to outline 
the boundaries of the program and to determine the means, 
methods and potentials for its realization is the first and main 
condition for the success of all the studies being made right 
now. They, however, as in the recent past, are closely connected 
with an evaluation of the effectiveness of scientific-technical 
progress in transport. 
  A difficult period of rehabilitation lies ahead, and the 
problem of correctly evaluating effectiveness takes on special 
meaning. We have in mind, of course, not the content of various 
methods of selecting investment decisions, although they too 
must be improved. It is a above all a question of a systematic 
approach to evaluating the technical, technological and 
administrative innovations being outlined. 
  The practice of planning the development and technological 
use of the achievements of science and technology through 
developing target-scientific-technical programs makes sense. The 
programs are often formed, however, outside their natural 
interrelation. For example, important target-oriented 
scientific-technical programs for increasing the railcar load, 
the weight of the train, the speed, labor productivity, etc. 
were in their time worked out for railroad transport. These 
programs were not mutually intercoordinated, however. This is 
perhaps one of the reasons why they were not fulfilled. 
  Our goal, however, is not to establish culprits, but to seek 
optimal solutions. The point is, that at the time these programs 
were drawn up, there was not a sufficiently reliable method to 
intercoordinate them. Each program and its elaborations was 
aimed at increasing only one, important but partial, indicator. 
It would seem that all the uncoordinated partial elaborations of 
this type could be intercoordinated in a unified comprehensive 
target-oriented program. 
  Two groups of problems must be distinguished in it. The 
first 
group includes building a mechanism relating technical, 
technological and administrative innovations to the indicator 
"productive force of the transport system," through the factors 
(indicators) determining it. The second group is the working out 
of the actual rules for managing the productive force of the 
transport system. 
  Following these rules should make it possible to serve the 
freight owner well, to earn the maximum income possible, to save 
on expenses, to raise the profitability and mass of the profit, 
to pay taxes, settle with creditors and introduce an insurance 
contribution. At the same time, it will become possible to 
substantially raise wages and increase the well-being of one's 
workers (and consequently, social protection of children, 
pensioners and the disabled) and to allot funds for creative 
purposes in the sphere of culture and education. The conditions 
will also be created to provide material, labor and financial 
resources to up-date the productive forces of the transport 
system according to the demand for transport. 
  Let us dwell on the first group of problems, since the 
second 
is an independent subject, meriting special consideration. 
  At present, the transport resource and the productive force 
of transport systems are among the scarcest resources in 
society. Meanwhile, to eliminate the shortage of the productive 
force of transport, particularly railroad, takes not only a 
large amount of funds, but also a long time. Therefore, we must 
take the maximum increase in productive forces per ruble of 
expenditures as the criterion for choosing the solutions to 
modernize and develop railroad systems for the future, at least 
up to the year 2000. 
  The connection between the productive forces of the 
production-economic systems and the technical, technological and 
administrative innovations used to up-date them is obvious. In 
fact, the productive force of the railroad transport system is 
equal to the product of the capacity of one productive cycle of 
it multiplied by the number of cycles, for example, per year. In 
turn, the capacity of the cycle is the function of the average 
freight capacity of a railcar, the coefficient of its use and 
the normative need for a working fleet of railcars. 
  It is obvious that the elements of scientific-technical 
progress are in some cases separate, and in other cases -- 
combined, related to the factors of the capacity of the 
transport cycle. For example, new railcars are related to the 
indicator of freight capacity and the coefficient of its use. 
Technological innovations, let us say, methods of loading and 
transporting, are connected with the average coefficient of use 
of the freight capacity and the working fleet. Administrative 
innovations, such as complete regulation of loading, 
organization of train work, etc., are related to the static 
load, i.e., to the product of the freight capacity multiplied by 
the coefficient of its use. The quality of regulating the 
railcar fleet on the network and roads affects the normative 
need for it, etc. 
  Under specific operating conditions, all the relations of 
technical, technological and administrative innovations to the 
factors of the capacity of the cycle can be expressed 
quantitatively. The same thing applies to the degree of 
influence that the quality of the innovations and scales of 
their production use has on the increase in the productive force 
of the system. 
  The relations between scientific-technical progress and its 
production cycle are also viewed as fully determined, and the 
measure of these relations can also be expressed numerically. 
Scientific-technical achievements resulting from applied science 
(and through it, as the result of basic sciences) with their 
technological application directly affect, in some way or other, 
the operations of the production cycle. This is a natural 
result, or else the creative function of applied science is 
lost. To some extent this influence will lead to shortening the 
production cycle. In this case, the number of cycles of the 
system increases beyond the period estimated and, consequently, 
its productive force increases. 
  If one has railroad transport in mind, then the 
scientific-technical programs developed by the MPS, "Nagruzka" 
[Load], "Skorost" [Speed], "Ves" [Weight] and "Proizvoditelnost 
truda" [Labor Productivity], provide for, as was noted, a 
numerical increase in individual indicators. These indicators 
are used in determining the productive force of the system. 
Consequently, all these programs can be intercoordinated and 
reduced to a unified program to up-date the productive forces of 
the railroad transport system. This is essentially important, 
since a unit of increased productive force of the system 
requires different expenditures to maintain and use -- depending 
on through which factors (load, weight, speed, etc.) this 
increase was achieved. If the price of a unit of productive 
force on the transport market is the same, then to obtain the 
greatest profit, the productive force must be increased through 
factors requiring lower expenditures. 
  In determining the efficiency of transport system 
modernization, its price is traditionally measured as the 
adjusted expenditures calculated by means of a normative 
coefficient of efficiency. In our opinion, it is advisable to 
choose solutions in the sphere of production-economic systems 
being guided by the sum of the expenditures of fixed and working 
capital during the period of time within the limits of the 
period of obsolescence of the fixed production capital -- the 
life cycle of the system. The result of its functioning during 
that same period is measured by the total value of the 
productive force. For a number of practical tasks, one should 
take into consideration the intensiveness with which the total 
productive force is used during the period, which is also 
determined by the period of obsolescence. 
  The theory of choosing investment decisions for railroad 
transport is in many cases based on the fact that there are many 
century-old structures on the roads, and the fixed part of the 
fixed production capital (locomotives and railcars) can be used 
for dozens of years. This has influenced the views of scientists 
and practical workers in different ways, especially in the 
management sphere. After the railroads were converted to new 
forms of traction, those of them that had resources at their 
disposal interpreted the theory quite specifically. The choice 
of decisions on minimum transport expenses and a long physical 
service life for the capital was often understood as the need to 
reduce the share of expenditures to develop transport. We know 
the result -- the deplorable state of the railcar fleet and 
locomotive service, tracks and man-made structures and the 
critical situation with respect to automating labor-intensive 
processes and developing the social sphere. Such basic tasks of 
scientific-technical progress as accelerating the fixed 
production capital turnover were left unrealized. 
  Meanwhile, in world practice the length of time for fixed 
capital turnover is now, on the average, 7-10 years and less. 
The periods for introducing scientific-technical innovations is 
being sharply reduced. A number of data, characteristic in this 
respect, were presented in the collection of international 
predictions by H. Weinhauser and E. Schmakk, "The World in the 
Year 2000." More discoveries and inventions appeared in every 
decade of the second half of the 20th century than in the 
preceding 2000 years. At the same time, in every subsequent 
decade, the number of inventions and discoveries doubled as 
compared with the preceding one. In the process of space 
research, in one decade 12,000-15,000 new products and 
technology, which had not existed before, were developed. 
Structural changes also took place in the economy which were 
related to scientific-technical progress in general, but affect 
the sphere of transport. 
  It is generally known that, in many directions of 
scientific-technical progress, Soviet science, technology, 
equipment, education, the vocational skill of the workers, and 
culture held a worthy position in the world. The 
political-economic crisis in Russia and the countries of Eastern 
Europe has as its prologue the deterioration in the general 
world situation. The predictions of H. Weinhauser and E. 
Schmakk, apparently, were not destined to come true. 
  The future of world economics and the development of 
transport depend on the conditions under which the people of 
Russia and other sovereign states on the vast expanses of the 
Eurasian area will live. Seven years of "perestroyka" once again 
confirmed the very close interrelation between transport and the 
state of the country's political, economic and social daily life. 
  According to students of the ancient "universal cosmic law," 
the transformation of a condition of disorder into an ordered 
condition also ensures the preservation of the basic conditions 
for the existence of the universe, man and morality. On the 
basis of this law, the condition of our country today should be 
evaluated as clearly one of disorder. We have not followed the 
advice of N.M. Karamzin, who wanted "...to unite what had been 
committed to us for centuries into a system, made serene through 
a harmonious rapprochement of parts." Unfortunately, in the 
years of perestroyka, no harmonious rapprochement of parts has 
been taking place in "what was committed to us for centuries" 
(read, in our past, powerful Motherland). 
  It would be appropriate here to remember that each 
politician, director, scientist, business executive, each of us 
is powerful not as a critic of the shortcomings of his 
predecessor, but through his deeds, creative work and 
housebuilding. We all answer for this before the people and our 
own conscience. 
  Railroads and transport are most closely involved in all 
this. For the economic market area, i.e., for a territory within 
the limits of which commodity exchange is carried out between 
market constituents, there is no stronger organizing material 
basis other than good railways. The influence here, of course, 
is mutual. On the one hand, transport for the territory is a 
necessary condition for forming the market area. On the other 
hand, the potential market area is an incentive to create new 
transport systems, in particular, for new railroad construction. 
A good example of this is the building of a railroad in the 
western part of the "Great Silk Route," re-establishing the 
ancient market area which includes China, India, Kazakhstan, 
Central Asia, Iran and Turkey. Transport appears here as a 
market participant with full rights and as a major product 
consumer. We also know how, in the last third of the past 
century, intensive railroad construction actively contributed to 
Russia's economic development. 
  The transition from an "area" to the Motherland is thorny 
and 
long. In this profession, both the roads and the means of 
movement can be most varied. In any case, however, it must be 
borne in mind that the power methods of the social structure 
have already completely exhausted themselves. For us, the 
historically proven road to human well-being entails steady 
movement to an organized, free and just society. This will be 
the new, well-ordered state of relations between different forms 
of ownership, interests and human duty. It will embody our 
values (scientific knowledge, faith, social protection, culture, 
morality), the achievements of West and East (particularly in 
the matter of developing and using the productive forces), and 
also the values of world religions and faiths in the sphere of 
charity and mores. 
  On the path from the present "area" to a well-ordered 
Motherland, few people take with them (in the words of Pitirim 
Sorokin) knowledge, labor and charity. We need an idea which 
would unite the peoples. An idea which possesses this ability, 
in our opinion -- is the idea of re-establishing our statehood. 
A historic mission has again befallen Russia -- to unite, on a 
new basis, the parts of a unified whole, scattered by 
centrifugal forces, to create a powerful economic field of 
centripetal forces. This is difficult, it takes a long time, but 
is historically inevitable. The states surrounding Russia (and 
not only they) will themselves, voluntarily, strive toward a 
union with Russia --developed and rich, free and 
multi-ethnically reborn. It has been that way in history more 
than once, and not just with the peoples inhabiting the 
territory of the former USSR. 
  History would like to arrange things so that it falls to 
Russia's lot to stand at the head of the educated world, and not 
only in the sphere of science and art, but also to head the 
rescue of today's civilization from fascism. Our state, its army 
and people accepted the tribute of the respect of progressive 
humanity. It is remarkable in this case that the grateful 
epistles were signed not only by friends and like-thinkers, but 
also by staunch anti-communists -- Franklin Roosevelt, Winston 
Churchill and Charles de Gaulle. This is also part of our 
history, part of the people's permanent memory, and a very 
essential part for an understanding of the future. The future, 
to a major extent, will be such that striving to know the Truth 
-- the meaning of life -- to evaluate the full-valued daily life 
of man and society in a new system of coordinates will 
increasingly become the main all-deciding factor: "Without a 
firm conception of self, and of what he is to live for, man 
cannot consent to live, and would rather destroy himself than 
remain living on earth, even if all around him be bread" (F.M. 
Dostoyevskiy).

<F P=106> [Article by Yu.M. Gerasimov, Russian Federation deputy </F>
minister of Railways: "A Program To Increase Traffic Safety"] 
  [Text] Railroad transport today, as at all times, remains 
the main arterial system of the country's economy. Under the 
conditions that have formed, the economic aspects are 
increasingly coming to the foreground of its activity. We need 
funds to maintain and up-date the technical devices, retain 
skilled personnel, develop scientific research and support the 
infrastructure. In the light of the new requirements, the 
criteria for evaluating losses due to traffic safety violations 
are also changing. Whereas before, the time of the interruption 
in traffic was counted, the economic loss now becomes the most 
important indicator. 
  Meanwhile, in just 11 months of 1993, direct losses to the 
state from wrecks and accidents constituted about 790 million 
rubles [R]. Fourteen locomotives and 778 railcars were smashed 
and damaged. Six people died in wrecks and 15 were injured. 
These figures alone indicate that the situation in the sphere of 
traffic safety requires careful analysis, study and realization 
of effective measures to stabilize it. 
  In the course of the last few years, all the activity 
directed toward ensuring train traffic safety was based on MPS 
Order No 10Ts of 1991, which played a decisive role in the 
implementation of organizational and technical measures to 
prevent accidents. Because of the changed situation in the 
country and in transport, however, a tendency has been noted to 
relax attention to traffic safety problems. As a result, in 1992 
there was a wreck with serious consequences at the Podsosenka 
Station on the October Railroad, and several other accidents 
also took place. A number of decisions were made that were new 
in principle, directed toward eliminating the causes giving rise 
to transport accidents. 
  In May 1992, the MPS issued Directive No 93-u, which more 
precisely defined the allocation of duty and responsibility to 
the directors of the MPS and the railroads for organizing 
accident-free operation. In August of the same year, the 
problems of ensuring traffic safety were discussed at a meeting 
of the collegium, which resolved to carry out special tests of 
railroad workers' knowledge of PTE [Regulations for Technical 
Operation of Railroads] and instructions, as well as special 
certification of supervisory and engineering-technical personnel 
involved in organizing the ensurance of traffic safety. The 
necessary measures were determined to increase the level of 
technical training for railroad workers and make more active use 
of economic incentive methods to increase safety. It was decided 
to carry out general checks on the use of safety instruments and 
to eliminate the operation of locomotives with faulty ALSN 
[continuous automatic locomotive signaling] devices. 
  In conjunction with the railroads, MPS administrations and 
concerned departments drew up a government-approved State 
Program To Increase Train Traffic Safety in RF Railroad 
Transport in the period 1993-2000. It specifies working out, 
developing and introducing technical devices to prevent 
accidents. Plants of the MPS and defense industry complex were 
called on to participate in its realization. 
  In 1993, the Statute on Material Remuneration for Ensuring 
Accident-Free Work for a Year was drawn up and approved by 
agreement with the Central Committee of the Independent Trade 
Union of Railroad Workers and Transport Construction Workers. A 
resolution was passed on improving the analysis of the causes of 
accidents, drawing in the scientific-research institute. A 
number of documents on ensuring safety when transporting 
hazardous freight were sent to the railroads. An MPS Directive 
on increasing the role and responsibility of inspectors for 
traffic safety in the matter of preventing accidents was drawn 
up and issued. 
  It must be emphasized that the appearance of each of these 
normative acts was dictated by practical experience, and their 
principal aim was to reduce the recurrence of errors, violations 
and causes of wrecks, accidents and cases of sub-standard work 
in train and shunting operations. The success of these documents 
and measures, however, depends entirely on their being put into 
practice at the sites. 
  At present there are 6,500 stations, 289 locomotive and 214 
railcar depots, 453 track subdivisions and 282 STsB [Signaling, 
Centralization and Blocking] and communications subdivisions in 
operation on the railroads of Russia. Some 1,216,000 people are 
engaged in operations activity. The absolute majority of the 
railroad men work conscientiously, ensuring train traffic 
safety. There have been no wrecks or accidents on the Ivanovo 
Division (V.A. Shofin, chief inspector for traffic safety) or on 
the Salsk Division (V.M. Shofin) in 20 years, on the 
Moscow-Circle Line Division (A.V. Osvaldo) in 8 years, and on 
the Bryansk (A.A. Tkachev), Solvychegodsk (P.Ye. Khokhlov), the 
Likhovskoye (V.A. Turin), Yelets (O.K. Dzhioyev), Ulyanovosk 
(A.A. Kostyuk), Penza (V.G. Kazantsev), Arkhangelsk (V.I. 
Pukanov), Voronezh (I.D. Kashkin) and Ryazan (V.A. Lechkin) 
divisions in the last 3 years. 
  This prolonged period of accident-free work is the result of 
the quite high level of organization. At the same time, there is 
a group of road divisions on which the traffic safety situation 
is unfavorable. For example, in just the past 3 years there have 
been 12 wrecks and accidents on the Petrozavodsk Division, 8 on 
the Kazan, 7 on the Volgograd, 6 on the Ruzayevka and 4 on the 
Rtishchevo. At the same time, three roads -- the October, Moscow 
and Gorkiy -- accounted for almost half of all the wrecks and 
accidents. 
  In 11 months of 1993, there were three wrecks involving 
passenger trains, with loss of life, on the Moscow, Kemerovo and 
East Siberian railroads. Workers of the Moscow, Gorkiy, North 
Caucasus, Kuybyshev, Baykal-Amur, Far Eastern, Sverdlovsk, West 
Siberian and Sakhalin railroads were to blame for passenger 
train accidents. 
  On the whole, the number of wrecks and accidents dropped by 
14 percent as compared with the same period last year (33 wrecks 
as against 41 and 28 accidents as against 30). The number of 
wrecks and accidents increased, however, on the Moscow, North 
Caucasus, Volga, Kuybyshev, South Urals, Sverdlovsk, Krasnoyarsk 
and Far Eastern railroads. An unfavorable situation has formed 
on the Caucasus, Mineralnyye Vody, Volgograd, Saratov, Perm, 
Tayga, Mogocha, Khabarovsk and Novosibirsk divisions, where 
there were several wrecks and accidents each. 
  Despite a certain reduction in cases of sub-standard work in 
train and shunting operations, the number of them is still 
large. Dangerous violations of traffic safety, such as running 
through stop signals, rolling stock drifting from stations and 
cracks in the axle journals of the wheelpairs and bogie side 
walls of freight cars, have not been eliminated. The number of 
cases of cars becoming uncoupled from passenger trains en route 
has risen. A number of roads, particularly the October, Moscow, 
Gorkiy, Kuybyshev and Southeastern, have recorded many cases of 
derailment of freight trains, some of which were on the verge of 
being wrecks or accidents. 
  The largest number of wrecks and accidents (50 percent), as 
before, fall to the track service. The reason -- unsatisfactory 
routine maintenance of the track, failure to adhere to the 
regular intervals for its inspection, delay in replacing 
critically defective rails, violation of the rules for doing the 
work, unsatisfactory maintenance of the switch assemblies and 
curved crossings, and poor quality of the track repair. This 
stems mainly from the low level of discipline and technical 
knowledge of the track brigade leaders and road foremen, and the 
disorganization and irresponsibility of the directors of the 
track subdivisions, departments and services. On 11 railroads, 
and particularly -- the Moscow, Volga and North Caucasus -- the 
track workers were to blame for wrecks and accidents. 
  The situation continues to be alarming at railroad level 
crossings. In 11 months of 1993, there were 324 collisions 
between trains and motor vehicle transport, as a result of which 
84 people were killed and 109 injured. Collisions with tour 
buses had very serious consequences on the Moscow, October, West 
Siberian and Far Eastern railroads, as well as collisions of 
means of transport with suburban and high-speed trains on the 
Volga and North Caucasus mainlines. It should be noted that the 
motor vehicle drivers are to blame for the overwhelming majority 
of collisions. The railroad workers should not be cleared of all 
responsibility, though. We all know the arsenal of means of 
combating this evil -- close interaction between the organs of 
GAI [State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate] and the local 
authorities, including interaction in building overpasses. At 
the same time, we should ensure that level crossings are kept in 
good working condition and modern technical devices to regulate 
traffic are introduced. 
  The railcar service situation remains difficult. Here, the 
number of wrecks has increased, and constitutes over 40 percent 
of the total number on the network. Things are worst of all in 
the railcar service of the Northern, North Caucasus and 
Kuybyshev roads. All the violations stem mainly from violation 
of the rules for inspecting and repairing railcars and failure 
to adhere to the technology of preparing consists for the 
journey. The incomplete provision of the work places with the 
necessary tools and devices, spare parts and materials has an 
adverse effect on the level of traffic safety provision. Some 
depots have no modern instruments for non-destructive monitoring 
of the state of the units and parts of the railcars, and the 
available ones are often in poor condition. The state of the 
axle units of freight cars on rolling bearings, the repair and 
technical service of which are carried out in extremely gross 
violation of the established technology, is particularly 
alarming. 
  The data listed show that 90 percent of the accidents and 
wrecks occur in two services -- track and railcar. It is here 
that the lack of discipline, irresponsibility and negligence of 
the workers appears to the greatest extent. There are, of 
course, also serious shortcomings in the other subsectors. For 
example, in the locomotive service, there are still cases of 
running stop signals, which attests to the lack of discipline 
and criminally negligent attitude of some of the engineers 
toward the job which has been entrusted to them. With modern 
equipment, even if it is not quite perfect, and with the 
existing regulations, there should be no discussion of running 
through signals. The collectives of many locomotive depots 
confirm this. In the last five years, for example, the engineers 
of the Moscow-Kursk, Novomoskovskoye, Moscow-Kiev, Khovrino, 
Novgorod, Kalinin, Leningrad-Sorting, Gorkiy-Moskovskoye, 
Gorkiy-Sorting, Kirov, Morshansk, Penza-1, Ulyanovskoye and many 
other depots have not run through a single stop signal. 
  In the transport industry, particular danger lurks in 
incidents of rolling stock drifting from stations because of the 
violation of the procedure for securing this stock, and also in 
freight-train defects, which in the past have ended in serious 
wrecks. The worst offenders in this subsector are the North 
Caucasus, October, Moscow and Gorkiy railroads. The shortcomings 
in ensuring traffic safety stem from the activity of other 
services as well, in particular, the signals, communications and 
computer technology, freight and commercial operations services. 
  As the tragedies of Sverdlovsk, Arzamas, Alma-Ata, Annay and 
other places, which stem from the transport of hazardous 
freight, recede farther and farther into the past, many 
executives, directors of all ranks and inspectors lessen their 
attention to this problem. As a result, in 11 months of 1993, 
the network had 13 wrecks, 6 accidents and 23 derailments 
involving cars with hazardous freight. Ninety-four derailments 
and 35 collisions involving cars with this type of freight took 
place at sorting humps and during shunting operations. In 
addition, emergency situations involving hazardous freight en 
route arose 740 times. They were caused mainly by leakage 
through faulty drain instruments, cracks, corroded openings and 
the welds of boilers. In this case there is a complete or 
partial loss of the freight, and human life and health are 
threatened. 
  At the beginning of 1993, the railroads were sent an 
analysis 
of the state of safety in the transport of hazardous freight, as 
well as recommendations on preventing emergency situations. 
Particular attention should be paid to monitoring adherence to 
the procedure for shunting cars loaded with hazardous freight, 
to training workers involved in its transport and also to 
monitoring the technical condition of rolling stock intended for 
the transport of hazardous freight. 
  Wrecks, accidents and cases of sub-standard work take place 
despite the fact that a precise system of accident-prevention 
measures has been drawn up for railroad transport. The actions 
of responsible officials were noted down and regulated in order 
to ensure coordinated and accident-free work, and the duty of 
the directors was clearly defined. The arsenal of these measures 
is constantly supplemented on the basis of analyzing the 
situation that has formed at the sites. This system is in 
operation in the absolute majority of work collectives. 
  As the analysis shows, wrecks, accidents and cases of 
sub-standard work take place mainly because the rules and 
instructions are violated. On the whole for the network, there 
are about 60,000 of these violators. This means that 
undisciplined or poorly trained workers, the proportion of which 
does not exceed 3 percent of the operations personnel, threaten 
train traffic safety. The number of slip-shod workers can be 
reduced and traffic safety increased accordingly only by 
painstaking and general work with the people and strict 
fulfillment of the accident-prevention measures. This is what 
production commanders and specialists of the 
inspector-instructor staff are called upon to do. 
  The system to ensure train traffic safety is made up of many 
components. These include personnel training, instruction, 
periodic checks of the actual fulfillment of instructions and 
monitoring the state of the technical devices, adherence to the 
procedure for examining each case, analysis of the results of 
checks and inspections, purposeful realization of preventive 
measures and the main thing -- keen organizational work with the 
people. The fundamental requirements for inspectors are 
formulated on the basis of the following points: be in the thick 
of events, know how to see what is essential, be principled, 
persistent and uncompromising, critically evaluate a situation 
and consider the future. 
  As checks and inspections show, a number of railroads have 
serious shortcomings in organizing ensurance of traffic safety. 
Their causes, however, are not being eliminated, because of the 
lack of principles and the policy of compromising with workers 
of the inspectorial staff who have these shortcomings. As a 
result, cases of sub-standard work, accidents and wrecks are 
repeated. 
  It is appropriate to remember, in this connection, the wreck 
of Elista-Moscow passenger train No 251, which occurred on 5 May 
1993 on the Kashira Division of the Moscow Railroad. 
  In October 1992, the road division's chief inspector for 
traffic safety inspected the Kashira subdivision of the line. In 
November, the chief of the subdivision examined the materials, 
but issued no order. In December, the division chief made an 
investigation and also came to no conclusions. This was not 
inadvertent, because the inspection was carried out on an 
extremely low level and many serious shortcomings were not 
revealed. In January 1993, the division inspector for the track 
service made out an inspector's directive for the chief of the 
subdivision, but it was not fulfilled. 
  On 1 March, 21 cars derailed at the Kashira Station. It was 
established that this kilometer had been unsatisfactorily 
evaluated for 12 months running, and on 18 February, with the 
passage of a track-recording car, the speed was restricted to 15 
km/hr because of 4th-5th class defects. The defects were not 
eliminated -- the road foreman noted the warning. The workers of 
the inspectorial staff could not help but have known about all 
this, but took no measures. Moreover, they did not monitor the 
carrying out of the spring inspection on this subdivision or 
elimination of the defects revealed in the course of it. 
  On 23 April at the 8th picket of the 121st kilometer (where 
the wreck of passenger train No 251 occurred two weeks later), 
the chief of the section, upon inspection, discovered that the 
spaces between the ties had not been filled up with ballast, the 
spikes had not been finished off, the rails were coming out of 
the sole plate rims, the joints were suspended and there were no 
gaps. They must either close it to traffic or restrict the 
speed. Neither was done, but the deadline established for 
eliminating the defects was before 26 April. They did not manage 
to put the track into good condition, though -- the wreck 
occurred. 
  Inspections and checks are given a considerable role in 
preventive work. This can be realized in full measure, however, 
only when the inspections are carried out with the appropriate 
quality, the results are examined promptly and the measures 
aimed at eliminating the shortcomings revealed are worked out 
and put into practice. 
  At the same time, railroad inspectors do not do enough 
target-oriented checking which would contribute to decisions 
aimed at preventing particularly dangerous violations, as for 
example, running stop signals. The inspectors have the 
opportunity and obligation to go through the entire chain of 
preventive work, through all its links. These, above all, are 
the organization of technical training and instruction, the 
quality of interpreting the speedometer tapes and using the 
results in working with engineers, the activity of the 
instructing engineers, systems of surprise checks, a command 
staff train escort, familiarization of the locomotive crews with 
documents on traffic safety, high-quality elaboration of the 
classified charts for driving the trains, adherence to labor 
legislation by the staff of dispatchers and duty attendants for 
the depots, etc. Behind this arsenal of measures stand people 
called upon for constant support of the vitality and efficiency 
of the system, each element of which also has its own chain of 
components. The inspector should therefore make a thorough study 
of the efficacy of this system, not only at one depot, but on 
the road as a whole, make the necessary decisions, specifying 
the responsible executors and periods, and strive for their 
fulfillment. This work must be organized so that each person 
feels his own personal responsibility for eradicating the 
existing shortcomings. 
  One of the forms of efficient influence over directors of 
all 
ranks who are involved in ensuring traffic safety is the Book of 
Inspectors' Instructions. As checks show, inspectors do not use 
this book enough. For example, the chief of the Ramenskiy track 
subdivision had a disdainful attitude toward ensuring traffic 
safety, and in the course of 1992, not a single entry was made 
in his Book of Inspectors' Instructions. On the Petrozavodsk 
Division, no entries were made in the Inspector's Instructions 
books of the locomotive depot chiefs for five to seven months. 
At the Suyevka Railcar Depot, this division's inspector for 
railcar service did not make any checks for one-and-a-half 
years. Very poor use is made of the Book of Inspectors' 
Instructions in working with the directors of the road 
administrations, services and divisions. A lack of proper 
monitoring of appropriate measures taken in accordance with the 
instructions entered in the Book and in formal inspection and 
checking documents is a general shortcoming. This attitude 
toward this document has an adverse effect on the authority of 
the inspectors themselves. 
  Planning work, making inspections and using the Book of 
Inspectors' Instructions are all different forms of influence on 
directors engaged in organizing traffic safety. After all, it is 
impossible for the inspectors to carry out the entire complex of 
anti-accident measures on their own. With his personal 
participation in carrying out preventive work, checks and 
inspections, combined with exactingness and adherence to 
principles, the inspector should arouse commanders of all ranks 
to adhere strictly to the system of accident protection, so that 
it may ultimately have a positive effect on the work of those 
directly involved in the performance of transport work. Each 
worker on the inspection staff must at the same time have a good 
knowledge of his own depot, surround himself with an active 
group of specialists of the services, and on its basis build 
interrelations with the directors, while critically assessing 
his own place in the work. 
  Increasing traffic safety, along with activating the 
organizational activity of the command and inspector-instructor 
staff in reinforcing discipline and increasing the 
responsibility of the railroad workers for the job entrusted 
them, is also achieved by developing and introducing up-to-date 
safety instruments, devices and systems, specified by the State 
Program for 1993-2000. Powerful design and productive forces, 
including the defense industry complex, are engaged in carrying 
out this program, and the necessary amount of funds has been 
allotted. The work is being given priority financing. 
  The state program outlines the development and introduction 
of devices to prevent trains running stop signals and colliding, 
based on the latest modifications of the SAUT-Ts [automatic 
brake control system], which ensures a train stopping before a 
stop signal if the engineer is distracted from driving the 
locomotive. The system continuously monitors the state of the 
main brake line, prevents the train from spontaneously rolling 
back, and also, at places requiring increased attention (speed 
restriction sections, bridges, tunnels, etc.), checks the 
alertness of the engineer by means of a voice informant. 
  To increase the reliability of the action of automatic 
locomotive signals and prevent running through stop signals at 
sections not equipped with SAUT, provision is made to introduce 
the ALSN [automatic locomotive signaling] microprocessor 
decoder, with the functions of a complete locomotive safety 
device, which is being developed, and the Dozor instrument, 
which makes it possible to remove from the engineer's cab the 
instruments (UKBM, L143, R1117) for periodic alertness checking 
and the unreliable (L168, R1103, R1104, etc.) equipment to 
prevent the train from spontaneously rolling back. A 
telemechanical system, which makes it possible to stop the train 
when the engineer falls asleep, is being introduced for 
continuous monitoring of the physiological (functional) state of 
the engineer. The program also specifies developing and 
introducing technical devices which make it possible for the 
engineer to control the tightness of the brake line and promptly 
ascertain possible cases of its closure or increased air leak. 
This device will be used on freight locomotives not equipped 
with SAUT. 
  In accordance with the State Program, the newest automation 
and communication devices are to be developed and introduced, 
including centralized traffic control, which makes it possible 
to record the train's position, the work of the STsB devices and 
the action of the station duty attendant. Automatic blocking 
with voice-frequency track circuits, possessing increased noise 
immunity, and permitting track work to be done with low ballast 
resistance and without insulating the joints, is slated to be 
put into operation. Being introduced for the first time are 
duplex train radio communications, which ensure mutual calling 
and conversations between locomotive engineers and the train 
dispatcher, using individual, group and circular calling; 
transmission of commands from the dispatcher and reports from 
the engineer, displayed on indicator boards, and in emergencies 
-- transmission of a command by the train dispatcher to stop the 
train and the engineer's calling the dispatcher; automatic 
transmission of an emergency signal warning that the train must 
make a stop on the line. 
  Devices to prevent railcars from arbitrarily leaving the 
station, particularly higher-power parking brake stops, with 
verification of the position and remote control, as well as 
blocking devices in sorting yards, which make it possible to 
hold back the consists and railcars safely on the maximum 
permissible slopes, must be developed and put into operation. It 
is planned to increase the safety of passenger car operation 
through the use of non-combustible and combustion-resistant 
lining materials, as well as fire signal systems. 
  An important direction of the State Program is working out 
and introducing devices for non-destructive checking of the 
diagnosis of the basic elements and parts of rolling stock and 
the tracks. Locomotive and railcar depots are to be equipped 
with portable supersonic defectoscopes to monitor the wheelpair 
tires and solid rolled wheel rims, as well as devices for 
technical diagnosis and measurements when railcars are repaired. 
The track service will have high-speed track-measuring cars with 
solid-state readout of information and its processing by 
computer. The existing track-measuring cars will get an 
automatic reading-interpretation system. Traffic safety will be 
achieved at railroad crossings through their further equipment 
with automatic signaling and the introduction of 
photo-monitoring devices to record violations of the travel 
rules, as well as through developing a set of technical devices 
to rule out the possibility of trains colliding with motor 
vehicles. 
  The Program outlines the development of technical devices 
for 
vocational selection, training and skill-improving of the 
workers in the basic railroad transport vocations. New machines 
and mechanisms will be developed for emergency reconstruction 
subdivisions of the railroads, including hoisting cranes and 
equipment to put derailed cars back on the track. It used to be 
necessary to procure this kind of equipment abroad. In addition, 
the State Program specifies carrying out priority scientific 
research and development for the purpose of creating a new 
generation of transport equipment and technology in the sphere 
of ensuring traffic safety, as well as working out a set of 
measures to improve the transport of hazardous freight, and 
legislative and normative acts on traffic safety. 
  Unfortunately, some of the assignments of the State Program 
are being carried out at a slow pace. For example, in 11 months 
of 1993, only 658 locomotives, out of the assigned 765, were 
equipped with SAUT devices, which are considered the basic means 
of preventing running through stop signals. The Southeastern, 
which equipped only 57 locomotives out of the assigned 100 with 
these devices, the East Siberian (29 locomotives out of 55) and 
the Far Eastern (49 out of 65) railroads lagged behind. The 
assignment to equip locomotives with electronic speedometers and 
duplex train radio communication was threatened with disruption, 
as were a number of other assignments. 
  The Main Administration is now working out measures to 
ensure 
traffic safety in railroad transport. These measures are based 
on the need for a stricter, more purposeful and constantly 
functioning system of carrying out preventive measures against 
accidents. The main thrust was made in organizing work with the 
people, increasing their knowledge and reinforcing production 
and technological discipline. Special importance is attributed 
to the use of all forms of incentive for railroad workers who 
perform their duties conscientiously, as well as to material 
responsibility for damage caused due to sub-standard work, 
accidents and wrecks. There must be a radical improvement in the 
organization of technical training of personnel and transition 
by stages to their vocational selection. 
  Top attention should be paid to ensuring traffic safety for 
passenger trains. The task of improving technical devices, and 
particularly tracks, railcars and locomotives, is to be achieved 
by the sectorial administrations and railroads. The existing 
shortcomings in repairing and maintaining the track, 
transporting hazardous freight and ensuring traffic safety at 
crossings should be eliminated. In connection with the approval 
of the new Regulations for Technical Operation of Russian 
Federation Railroads, services are to be introduced by stages, 
in accordance with these regulations. 
  Along with putting the State Program into effect, a great 
deal of work is to be done for widescale introduction of devices 
and instruments developed at the sites and showing a high degree 
of efficiency in their work. VNIIZhT [All-Union Railroad 
Transport Scientific-Research Institute] must work out the 
organizational structure and basic points of a system of 
certification for enterprises and technological processes, as 
well as the basic sectorial standards for traffic safety. 
Systems of preventive measures to prevent accidents, and basic 
norms for the personal participation of the supervising 
personnel in this work must also be put into practice everywhere. 
  The problem of high-quality evaluation of the inspectorial 
staff is no less urgent. The activity of each inspector must be 
attentively and critically examined and his potentials 
determined, and the correct decisions made on this basis. Each 
inspector, on his section, must know not only how to evaluate 
the state of the technical devices or safety as a whole, but 
also how to determine the reasons for what happens and the poor 
workmanship of the commander responsible for it, how to find 
ways to normalize the situation and achieve their realization. 
It is also important for each inspector to be able to foresee in 
time the focal points of danger and to react promptly. The work 
of the inspectors should in future be evaluated, not for the 
quantity and comparison of the number of cases of sub-standard 
work, but for accident prevention and the adherence to 
principle, exactingness and objectivity displayed. Any attempts 
to smooth over a situation, or lack of objectivity in 
classifying safety violations and recording them must be 
stopped. In difficult and multi-dimensional inspectorial work, 
he must, above all, be self-organized. He must think about 
improving the style of his work in order not to get bogged down 
in trifles, and think about keeping under control himself, his 
subordinates and those of his commanders who are inclined to 
oversimplification in problems of ensuring traffic safety. 
  The work of the public inspectors has been increasingly less 
often remembered recently -- this true form of control has died 
out. At the same time, it is hard to solve safety problems 
without drawing a broad circle of railroad workers into the 
struggle against accidents. We must seek new forms and at the 
same time make use of what we have at our disposal: increase the 
prestige of the Book of Engineers' Comments, promote to the 
utmost material incentive for the railroad workers who alertly 
support the service, and also the directors of enterprises which 
have long ensured the proper level of traffic safety 
organization, and support and guide the activity of the 
assistant chiefs of the enterprises to traffic safety.

<F P=106> [Report on Ministry of Railways Scientific and Technical </F>
Council session by N. Davydov: "Let the Railcars Run a Little 
Longer"] 
  [Text] When they say that we are living in an unstable and 
unpredictable time, I ask myself: how is this manifested in 
railroad transport? The overwhelming majority of the sector's 
employees are continuing to perform their professional duties 
conscientiously in spite of everything. Otherwise, the freight 
and passengers would not be delivered to their destinations. 
  But this is being achieved at an increasingly higher price. 
I 
will not mention all the aspects of transport activity, just 
one. In recent years, the number of freight cars in disrepair 
has been increasing on railroads in both Russia and the CIS 
countries. This is the result of a certain lack of 
responsibility in their use and the forced division of the fleet 
while they continue to be operated jointly, which leads to the 
steady obsolescence of the rolling stock and sharp deterioration 
in all types of repair work. 
  Generally speaking, this is not a new problem. It existed 
even before the collapse of the USSR. But now the crisis in the 
economy and inflation are aggravating the situation. Investments 
in railroad transport have been reduced to zero and the purchase 
of new rolling stock has been practically discontinued. 
Accordingly, railcars are coming in for maintenance more and 
more frequently, but there are not enough funds for this. 
  Quite naturally, the question arises: how do we stop the 
trend of more and more railcars in disrepair? Specialists of the 
VNIIZhT [All-Russian Railroad Transport Scientific Research 
Institute] suggest that the railcars be assigned to railroads 
for repair, which, they say, will make it possible to create a 
self-regulated organizational-economic mechanism capable of 
maintaining the railcar fleet in good technical working order. 
Finding support from specialists in the MPS [Ministry of 
Railways] Railcars Main Administration, they proposed that this 
matter be submitted for discussion by the Scientific and 
Technical Council. 
  While Professor V. Buyanov, head of the Transport 
Development 
Prospects Laboratory of the VNIIZhT, and I Glukhov, chief of the 
Railcars Main Administration, were speaking, the impression was 
created that after the railcars are assigned to the railroads, 
the quality of their repair will improve and the expenses for 
this purpose will even be reduced. But then their opponents--V. 
Gorbunov, chief engineer of the Transpoort Main Administration, 
and G. Bugrov, chief of the Statistics Administration--were 
given the floor, and they cited numerous reasons to show that 
the existing system for operating and maintaining the railcar 
fleet must not be changed. 
  Without getting into the details of the dispute, it is still 
necessary to dwell on the main factors which Deputy Minister A. 
Kondratenko, who was chairing the session, repeatedly attempted 
to clarify. What is your conviction--that assigning railcars to 
the railroads will improve repair quality--based on? What is bad 
about the system now in use and how do we correct this? 
  Running ahead, I will say that neither side cited exhaustive 
and sufficiently persuasive arguments. There were many 
analytical statistics and variations of organizational and 
economic impact on the operations and repair processes, but on a 
practical level they looked questionable at times. 
  For example, there are no justifiable grounds for the 
statement that the railcars' assignment to railroads will make 
it possible to improve the quality of depot repair, in their 
opponents' opinion. In such a case, what is to happen to repair 
cooperation and specialization, which is the basis for the 
distribution of railcar depots in the railroad system? But the 
main point is that there continue to be many rulers of the 
railcar's destiny as before--chiefs of stations, the heads of 
PTO's [technical inspection points], and so forth on the chain 
over which it passes--but it has not had and does not have a 
really responsible owner. 
  Returning to the reasons which forced the VNIIZhT 
specialists 
to conduct research on the problem, they were based on an abrupt 
transition from a critical shortage to a large surplus in the 
railcar fleet. It did not turn out to be so simple to adapt to 
the new situation. But the continuing decline in transportation 
services is leading to a further increase in the freight car 
surplus. Under the conditions of rising inflation and 
nonpayments, it is more and more difficult for the Ministry of 
Railways to maintain them in good operating condition. 
  To emphasize the need to decentralize the railcar fleet, the 
VNIIZhT referred to experience in the United States, where the 
basic parameters--length of the system, the distances involved, 
the freight handling, freight turnover, and so forth--are 
similar in many respects to Russia's railroads. But there the 
entire fleet is the property of the railroads and private 
enterprises, and the railcar owners bear all the expenses for 
their maintenance and repair. A special automated system follows 
the 2 million railcars of the common fleet of the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico. There are no problems with redistribution, 
and record keeping has been organized at a high level. 
  But after all, it is the last condition which probably will 
turn out to be a bottleneck for the Russian railroads in 
assigning railcars. Though according to VNIIZhT calculations, 
empty runs to "their" railroad and the average waiting time for 
repair will increase substantially. However, taking into account 
the undeveloped state of our information systems and the lack of 
proper control over the transfer of railcars at junctions 
between railroads, and so forth, V. Gorbunov said, the gain from 
the innovation is very doubtful, but as far as the losses are 
concerned, they are obvious. This includes losses in average 
train weight and locomotive productivity (because of the empty 
run), which leads to higher operating expenses. 
  All the same, let us return again to the situation that has 
taken shape now. The MPS is not in a position to buy new 
railcars in the quantity needed now. The railroads owe huge sums 
for previous deliveries and repair of freight cars. Taking into 
account the deterioration of rolling stock, it has not been 
ruled out that there may be a substantial shortage of rolling 
stock by the end of the decade, if the country finally begins to 
emerge from the crisis, of course. 
  At the same time, according to information from the Railcars 
Main Administration, there are about 110,000 inoperative 
railcars in the system every day, and as strange as it seems, 
this figure is not decreasing. Although last year 635,000 
railcars were restored by all types of repair! The clearly 
abnormal situation is forcing us to look not only for a solution 
to reduce operating expenditures today, but so that we do not 
end up where we were before if the freight flow begins to 
increase. 
  I do not know who my neighbors were, but by the end of the 
session, when it had become completely obvious that the prepared 
version for assigning railcars to the railroads would not be 
adopted, an interesting dialogue took place between them: 
  "Actually, they proposed a division for one purpose: to 
assign a place of repair for each railcar." 
  "But they divided among the CIS administrations, you know, 
and basically only Russia and Belarus are performing the repair." 
  "Not at all--others are creeping in little by little, 
although I agree that a great deal depends on how the commanders 
of independent railroads make use of their levers of influence." 
  "All the same, a transport worker is still in command of the 
railcar; railcars administration employees essentially are not 
the proprietors, and with our level of responsibility and 
discipline in that administration, there will not be any!.." 
  The question automatically arises: did anything of value 
come 
out of the discussion that took place? 
  We can firmly say: yes, of considerable value. It defined 
the 
specific range of problems which must be resolved in order to 
put economic levers into use for efficient operation of the 
current system or a new system, as A. Kondratenko put it. First 
of all, we need a balance inventory of the railcar fleet by car 
numbers. In the event that there is a division among railroads, 
the financing procedure will have to be changed. The principles 
involved in the division also must be defined more specifically. 
And so forth. 
  It is regrettable only if the main point is shifted 
imperceptibly to second place after all these technical 
problems: will the railcar have an owner, all the same? Whoever 
receives income from its operation will take care of it. Not 
because of an order to do so, but because he has an interest in 
its good working order. 
  Perhaps those who have said that an inspector should be the 
railcar owner are right? Yes, they are the ones who know "the 
subject" like no one else and could take care of it. But this 
"trifle" is needed for that: they must be given the right to 
determine what happens to it, and neither the station chief, nor 
the chief of the railcars service, nor even the one in charge of 
the main administration would be able to countermand their 
decision! 
  I ask myself: what kind of status and professional level 
should they have then? And I respond that this is probably the 
most complicated of all the questions. But we will have to 
answer it anyway. If not today, then tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Kemerovo Railroad safety inspection by deputy minister's </F>
commission reported by GUDOK corespondent N. Domozhirov: "The 
Inspectors' Landing Party"] 
  [Text] In the last 10 days of March, A. Koryachkin, 
chief of the Kemerovo Railroad, signed an order in accordance 
with the results of a traffic safety inspection. It was 
conducted by a group of specialists headed by Russian Deputy 
Minister of Railways Yu. Gerasimov 
  I will stipulate right away that the inspection had been 
planned, and at first glance, nothing had foreshadowed any 
particular trouble. After all, according to results of work in 
the preceding quarter, the ministry collegium and the trade 
union central committee had awarded the Kemerovo Railroad first 
place in the system, providing it with a monetary bonus as 
incentive. But overall evaluation of economic activity in a 
specific period is one thing and meticulous analysis of one 
aspect of the production process is a completely different 
matter. 
  But the point is not in the method of inspection, of course. 
Serious miscalculations in safety matters were actually made on 
the Kemerovo Railroad. The commission checking implementation of 
Order No. 1Ts of 8 January 1994 issued by the minister of 
railways "On measures to provide for traffic safety in railroad 
transport" came to the conclusion: this important work has 
deteriorated on the Kemerovo Railroad in recent years, resulting 
in a number of wrecks and accidents and an increase in the 
number of cases involving defective items. The managers of 
certain subunits began to embellish their reporting instead of 
increasing their demands on subordinates and themselves. In 
particular, more than 10 (!) cases of rolling stock derailment 
and collisions during switching were not taken into account in a 
2-month period this year at the Kemerovo-Sortirovochnoye station. 
  In the 37-page formal document on the 3-week inspection 
compiled by B. Bogomolov, S. Nikishin, and A. Svetozarskiy, the 
chief inspectors of the TsRB [possibly: Central Inspection 
Bureau], the main cause of all the violations was a decline in 
labor and performance discipline, as well as the reduced demand 
for it. For example, 269 persons were absent from work in the 
Kemerovo Subdivision last year, but only 66 were fired for 
absenteeism. In the Topki Subdivision, the number of absentees 
during the same period increased by 1.5 times as many, but fewer 
persons were dismissed than in the previous year, 1992. 
  The commission revealed numerous cases in which disciplinary 
misdemeanors were not investigated expeditiously. After this, we 
should not be surprised by the irresponsibility of ordinary 
production workers. 
  There is no reason to list the negative facts which appeared 
in the inspection document, for they have already been given a 
principled and quite strict assessment. I will dwell on the 
analysis conducted by Deputy Minister Yu. Gerasimov. 
  The impartial discussion which took up an entire work day 
proved to be instructive and certainly will be of value to 
production commanders. Regardless of the persuasiveness of the 
commission's criticism, not all the railroad's subdivision 
managers were imbued with personal responsibility for the safety 
conditions. Some attempted to turn the discussion into a calm 
channel, as if nothing serious had taken place. Others were 
inclined to place the blame on miscalculations by someone else, 
but not on themselves. As an example, this position was taken by 
V. Avdonin, chief of the Kemerovo-Sortirovochnoye station, who 
"substituted" employees of the railroad's inspection service who 
allegedly interpret individual violations arbitrarily. They hold 
a similar point of view in the Novokuznetsk Division, where they 
sometimes describe the escape of railcars during switching in 
milder terms than they should. 
  What can be said in this regard? In fact, there are certain 
contradictions between the normative documents and directives 
from sector headquarters. But they are not sufficiently 
important to be covered up. The striving to escape personal 
responsibility at any price to smooth over the contradictions in 
this situation was so inappropriate that the deputy minister 
removed A. Avdonin as station manager on the spot. 
  It seemed to me that this was the culminating moment of the 
analysis, which was typical of the tense situation. Though 
several days afterward, through the railroad management's 
intercession, the dismissed employee was given the chance to put 
his place of work in order and to correct the procedure in 
working with categorized and hazardous freight from chemical 
enterprises in Kemerovo, for which Avdonin had been criticized. 
  All services without exception were sharply criticized. I 
will name one of the most important ones--the lines service. 
Last year, passenger train No. 178 from Kislovodsk to 
Novokuznetsk was wrecked, railcars were derailed six times while 
they were in trains and 54 times during switching, all the fault 
of employees. Safety conditions were especially poor in the 
Topki, Kemerovo, and Polosukhinsk line subdivisions, which 
accounted for nearly half of the defective equipment in the 12 
subdivisions of the lines service. 
  During the course of comments by the main administration 
commission, a question was raised repeatedly about the 
unsatisfactory view held by the lines service and its 
subdivisions toward the directive of 18 March 1993 "On the 
introduction of permanent alternate lines and engineering 
structures." In conformity with the directive, it was planned to 
add 240 line inspectors promoted from the ranks of the best 
trained linemen. However, even now, a year later, the ministry's 
directive has not been fully implmented, which has substantially 
reduced the gain that had been planned. 
  Of course, it is more complicated to resolve the problem of 
line personnel under conditions in Siberia than in regions with 
a favorable climate. The fact that workers in the industrial 
Kuzbass have a wide choice of work in their locations has a 
negative effect as well. However, all this should not relax the 
lines suprvisors, but make it incumbent on them to work more 
diligently on personnel training. 
  The railcars service was the only one where the number of 
equipment breakdowns increased at an alarming rate in 1993; they 
included the following major defects: fractures in axle 
journals, wheels, and truck side-frames. Preparation of trains 
for a run shows practically no improvement, and flagrant 
violations of the rules were permitted in repairing automatic 
brakes and automatic coupling equipment. In the wheel and roller 
bearing shops, repair procedure is not being followed, and 
assembly and inspection of bearing boxes is performed manually. 
These shortcomings have not been corrected for a long period of 
time, and the commission proposed that the chief of the railroad 
reinforce the service's management with personnel for this 
reason. 
  But take the signals and communications service. Commission 
members devoted their attention to the fact that equipment is 
being updated very slowly here. Obsolete systems of electrical 
centralization are being operated at 11 stations. Work to 
separate the power cables and the signal and blocking cables has 
not been performed at many ETs [electrical switch and signal 
centralization] stations. 
  I would err against the truth if I limited a report on the 
analysis to only the critical observations. At the inspectors' 
recommendation, the chief of the railroad (more visible from the 
side, as they say!) expressed gratitude and awarded a bonus to 
leading employees who have been successful in resolving traffic 
safety problems. They include V. Sinitsyn, chief engineer of the 
Novokuznetsk Locomotive Depot, and L. Gulyakin, that depot's 
deputy chief; and T. Khadarin, inspector in the Novokuznetk 
Division, who was given particularly high praise by the deputy 
minister. Monetary incentives were awarded to A. Rossoshanskaya 
and R. Bauer, psychologists at the Novokuznetsk and Belovo 
locomotive depots; their work, which was inconspicuous at first 
glance, was put on an equal footing with the work of leading 
production employees. 
  In the opinion of the main administration commission, the 
experience of the Kemerovo Railroad psychologists who 
distinguished themselves deserves every possible support and 
dissemination in the system, and as a correspondent, I will tell 
our newspaper's readers about this soon.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Is the President Without a National </F>
Security Service?"] 
  [Text] The other day, Sh. Karamanukyan, head of the 
Armenian president's administrative staff, called in the five 
employees of the service headed by the president's chief adviser 
on national security remaining in the ranks and notified them 
that the service, which as we know was formerly headed by Ashot 
Manucharyan and Vaan Avakyan, is to be disbanded in 2 weeks. 
After their retirement the service was essentially inactive, 
although the employees reported for work regularly. The head of 
the administrative staff displayed kindness by not ruling out 
the possibility of helping the dismissed personnel find new 
employment. 
  To all appearances, an appropriate edict by the president 
will be adopted by 15 April. It is on that day that the period 
for implementation of another edict--on freezing the activity of 
operations divisions of the GUNB RA [State Directorate of 
National Security of the Republic of Armenia]--is completed. It 
is hoped that the new document will at least state the reasons 
for disbanding the National Security Service as well as the 
GUNB. Finally, someone should familiarize the public with the 
new conception of the activity of such services. Otherwise, we 
must assume that the president is not concerned about national 
security matters.

<F P=106> [Interview with S.N. Baburin, State Duma deputy, member of </F>
the Russian Way parliamentary group, and leader of the Russian 
All-People's Union, by LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA correspondent in 
Bulgaria Olga Reshetnikova; in Sofia; date not given: "Sergey 
Baburin: 'Drawing on the Experience of History...' The Balkan 
Knot and Russia"] 
  [Text] S.N. Baburin visited Yugoslavia (as a member 
of a State Duma delegation) and Bulgaria together with his 
colleagues from the Russian Way parliamentary group, S.A. Glotov 
and A.A. Dolgopolov. As far as their trip to Bulgaria is 
concerned, it is noteworthy in its own right: Figures of the 
patriotic movement in Russia of such renown have not visited 
here yet; the Bulgarian public has a hazy notion about the 
movement itself, whereas the leading Bulgarian mass media, as a 
rule, paint it in the "Red-and-Brownshirt" tones and invariably 
associate it with the name of V.V. Zhirinovskiy. In Sofia, S.N. 
Baburin gave an interview to this correspondent. 
  [Reshetnikova] Sergey Nikolayevich, what was the purpose of 
your trip to Yugoslavia? 
  [Baburin] Contrary to the commonplace view of a "brilliant" 
foreign policy victory of Russia which has succeeded in 
forestalling the bombing of Serbian positions in Bosnia by NATO 
forces, we believe that on the whole, the current leaders of the 
foreign policy establishment are proceeding within the framework 
of the U.S. strategic plan in resolution of the Yugoslav crisis, 
having in particular played along with the United States in 
forming a Croatian-Muslim state association. In the course of 
developing its specific proposals for the settlement of the 
Yugoslav conflict, it became necessary for the ROS [Russian 
All-People's Union], of which I am a leader, to verify the 
correctness of the analysis of the situation existing there 
locally, to examine the position of the Russian military 
contingent in Yugoslavia and the conditions and nature of its 
activities, and to analyze the consequences of the introduction 
of Turkish "blue helmets" to Bosnia. We took advantage of a 
long-standing invitation to visit Yugoslavia which had been 
confirmed at a recent meeting with R. Karadzic in Moscow. The 
trip turned out to be very useful. We accumulated many 
observations, and listened to our Serbian friends and Russian 
servicemen. All of this has yet to be analyzed and the requisite 
conclusions have yet to be drawn. Therefore at present it is 
premature to discuss specific results. However, I can note one 
point right now: Serious adjustments should be made in the 
policy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia with regard 
to the Yugoslav crisis. 
  [Reshetnikova] Do you think that now, when Yugoslavia is the 
focus of attention for reasons that are easy to understand, 
other countries of the Balkan region, primarily our traditional 
partner Bulgaria, have been left out of the field of vision of 
Russian politicians? Meanwhile, the leadership of Bulgaria has 
declared the country to be a francophone state to which the 
imperial ambitions of Russia allegedly pose the main threat. 
Sofia, the sworn brother of Tel Aviv and Ankara, is knocking on 
the doors of NATO, and on the day of the national holiday they 
fly the flag of the European Community here.... 
  [Baburin] While both interested parties share the blame for 
the current state of Russian-Bulgarian relations, I cannot but 
acknowledge a serious omission in the foreign policy of Russia. 
This state of affairs ought to be rectified as soon as possible. 
This is why we eagerly accepted the invitation to come to 
Bulgaria issued by deputies of the Bulgarian parliament from the 
Fatherland Party of Labor, as well as the Zora Political Circle, 
whose approach to quite a number of key problems is close to 
that of the ROS: We are in favor of traditionalism, a reverent 
attitude toward the past, an original national path of 
development for each country, major economic reforms on the 
basis of a mixed economy, but without the total annihilation of 
all things that have proven to be viable and useful. We have 
come to Bulgaria in order to establish direct interparty and 
interparliamentary links, to consult, and to discuss problems 
which are immediate for both Russia and Bulgaria. The spectrum 
of such problems is very broad: Prospects for the resumption of 
economic cooperation between our two countries, the role of 
Russia and Bulgaria in settlement of the Yugoslav crisis and 
keeping the peace in the Balkans in general, the problem of 
integration of East European countries in NATO, and so on. A 
conversation with, for example, Chairman of the National 
Assembly of Bulgaria A. Yordanov indicated that we do not have 
mutual understanding on all these problems. We believe that NATO 
in the form in which it continues to exist is aimed against 
Russia even now. Yes, we are in favor of a partnership for 
peace, but a genuine partnership on an equal footing. For now, 
an attempt to make our states fit its political, economic, 
military, and cultural standards is obvious in the approach of 
the United States; meanwhile, both Russia and Bulgaria have 
paths of their own. We can accomplish a genuine revival only by 
drawing on our national traditions and our experience of 
history. We differed with the chairman of the Bulgarian 
parliament in our assessment of Bulgarian-Soviet relations in 
the past. Certainly, the imitation of friendship and the 
uncritical attitude toward each other harmed relations between 
our peoples. However, it would be incorrect to discard outright 
the existence of sincere friendly feelings which the Bulgarian 
people had during those years and, as I have ascertained, retain 
to this day. Just because we are from Russia, we were very 
warmly greeted both in Sofia and in the cities of Kazanluk, 
Shipka, and Kurdzhali. 
  [Reshetnikova] You visited areas which are densely settled 
by 
the Turkish and Bulgarian Muslim population in the immediate 
proximity of Turkey. It is little known in our country that 
certain external forces are attempting to fuel interethnic and 
religious conflicts in Bulgaria and encourage pro-Turkish and 
pro-Macedonian separatist organizations. The American ambassador 
to Bulgaria openly states that the Bulgarian Constitution which 
bans the creation of parties and political organizations on an 
ethnic basis is "imperfect." To your mind, how grave is the 
danger of the Bosnian scenario being replicated in Bulgaria? 
  [Baburin] This is a very serious problem, and I am 
profoundly 
convinced that the leadership of Bulgaria underestimates it, 
however, like the leadership of Russia. The state must guarantee 
the rights and liberties of all its citizens; in turn, any 
attempt to acquire special rights merely along ethnic or 
religious lines represents a step toward the destruction of not 
just democracy but also the state itself. At a meeting with the 
public of the city of Kurdzhali I said frankly: "Look at what is 
happening in Russia; may this be a warning to you against 
experiments involving the demand to make your area autonomous." 
The activities of separatist organizations may result in the 
splitting up of Bulgaria along ethnic and religious lines, which 
is tantamount to the death of the Bulgarian state. The 
separation of the Rhodope [Mountains], which are populated by 
the Turkish and Bulgarian-Muslim element, will directly connect 
Turkey to Macedonia (where the proportion of Muslims is growing 
continuously), and subsequently to Albania and Bosnia. 
  [Reshetnikova] Indeed, the actions of Washington and Ankara 
in the Balkans reveal an aspiration to create a "Muslim arc" 
here that will pass through the north of Greece, the south of 
Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, and Bosnia. The creation of this 
arc will place an effective means to pressure Europe at the 
disposal of Washington and, in addition, will isolate the 
Christian states--Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria--from one 
another, also separating them from Russia. Bulgarian patriotic 
forces are seriously concerned about this prospect, and are 
looking to Russia with hope. As we have learned, the "Worldwide 
Congress of Slavic Orthodox Christian Nations," of which V.V. 
Zhirinovskiy became chairman, has just been held in Moscow; the 
ideas of creating an all-Slavic parliament and army have been 
voiced. What is your opinion of this? 
  [Baburin] One should receive the eccentric statements of 
V.V. 
Zhirinovskiy while keeping it definitely in mind that he is a 
young politician; this is why excessive attention to his 
declarations is harmful for him, just as is free advertisement. 
In general it surprises me that in Bulgaria, Zhirinovskiy is 
perceived to be a representative of national-patriotic forces. 
There is nothing for Zhirinovskiy to create. The inseparable 
bond between Russia and the Balkan nations has been created over 
millennia. Russia is historically responsible for the countries 
of the Balkan Peninsula; it was and still is a guarantor of 
their territorial integrity and independence. We are against the 
attempt, foisted on us from the outside, to create a pillar of 
Russian policy in the form of one Balkan state at the expense of 
others and come out in favor of mutually advantageous relations 
on an equal footing between Russia and all Balkan states, 
primarily Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Greece, which are 
traditionally close to us. To my distress, the chairman of the 
Bulgarian parliament characterized this task as "not too 
essential." For ages the enemies of Russia and the Orthodox 
faith have set the task of the Balkan nations quarreling among 
themselves. A patriotic Russia sets the task of achieving mutual 
understanding and cooperation among these nations. We are 
against the creation of military blocs in this region, including 
blocs of a pan-Slavic nature. Our victory is not in achieving 
military superiority but in the victory of the spirit and 
economics. So far a Russian foreign policy concept for the 
Balkans has not been apparent. The current leaders of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs operate by the trial-and-error 
method. However, this is a dead end: Ill-conceived steps cause 
problems whose resolution produces illusory victories, but 
nobody is held responsible in the process. I am convinced that 
for Russia it was a mistake to vote in favor of sanctions 
against Serbia and Montenegro and agree to the Turkish military 
presence in the Balkans under the guise of the "blue helmets." 
This will unavoidably encourage separatist trends in the 
Muslim-populated areas of Greece, Bulgaria, and Macedonia, and 
boost the pressure of Turkey, the United States, and NATO on 
Belgrade, Sofia, and Athens, which will be unable to effectively 
resist it, given the unpredictable and inconsistent policy of 
Russia. However, I believe that the situation will change; 
Russia will finally follow a far-sighted foreign policy course 
based first of all on its national-state interests. For this to 
happen, truly democratic, patriotic forces with a statesmanlike 
frame of mind, for whom serving the Motherland is above all, 
should come to power in our country.

<F P=106> [Article by Richard Ovinnikov, doctor of historical </F>
sciences: "CIS Not a Burden for Moscow: The Commonwealth as a 
Guarantee of General Revival"] 
  [Text] The Commonwealth of Independent States, which 
emerged from the rubble of a superpower, is into its third year. 
Sufficient time to have left the infant and toddler phase and to 
have begun to walk unaided. But the diagnosis "something is 
rotten," which was once appended to the state of affairs "in the 
state of Denmark," has proven appropriate to the CIS also. The 
processes of the formation of the Commonwealth are proving 
contradictory, and successes are being replaced by failures, 
setbacks even. As a result, no one can say for certain what will 
come of all this. 
  Let us attempt to grasp the realities that have emerged. It 
would seem that the correct reference point is the historical 
background from which the present relationships in the 
Commonwealth are growing. 
<H5>  Is the Role of Leader a Burden? </H5>
  How were the components of the CIS' predecessor--the Soviet 
Union--correlated between themselves? A well-known charge 
leveled at it is that it was an empire. Let us take a look 
according to a dispassionate criterion of identification of a 
real empire, namely, whether the center (metropolis) pumps 
resources from the periphery (colonies). According to figures 
used by, we would note, the International Monetary Fund, the 
charges are not borne out--the Union center was a major donor in 
respect to the five most backward Central Asian republics. Thus 
at the last stage of the existence of the USSR, in 1991, Union 
subsidies, according to IMF data, constituted the following 
proportion of these budgets: 45 percent in Tajikistan, 43 
percent in Uzbekistan, 35 percent in Kyrgyzstan, 25 percent in 
Kazakhstan, and 22 percent in Turkmenistan. Thus according to a 
key criterion, the Union was not an empire. It effected 
infusions into the economy of the outlying areas, did not pump 
resources out. 
  But this is only the first step toward establishment of the 
root system. Let us try to exfoliate the facts further. There 
arises, for example, the question: Where did the sums of money 
for the subsidies come from? From other, more economically 
developed Union republics, primarily Russia, which accounted for 
60 percent of the overall potential. So what kind of nature of 
relationship was it--"plunder in reverse," as it is sometimes 
portrayed? Not this either. World experience testifies that this 
is a normal, even typical, mode of interaction within any 
federation. It is a question of the civilized redistribution of 
resources among its members. 
  Let us look at Canada, the federation most similar to us 
both 
in terms of size of territory and natural and climatic 
conditions and in terms of difference in the development of 
individual parts of the country. The most industrially advanced 
province of Canada--Ontario, accounting for 55 percent of 
national production--is the main donor in relation to the 
majority of the remaining 11 provinces and territories. Some of 
them receive very substantial resources nominally from the 
federal government, but in fact from Ontario. Thus for Canada's 
four Atlantic provinces these transfers constituted in 1987 the 
following percentage of their total income: 47 for Newfoundland, 
46 for Prince Edward Island, 40 for New Brunswick, and 38 for 
Nova Scotia. 
  In other words, the identity of the roles of Russia and 
Ontario is obvious. It consists of the function of leader of the 
federation, its locomotive, which is followed by the whole 
train. It is important that the allocations made the others by a 
forward-looking leader are by no means a one-sided burden. They 
are also an assurance of the health of all members of the single 
organism, a guarantee of the unity and integrity of the 
federation. A wise head does not refuse to maintain the arms and 
legs. The main thing is that the leader himself obtains a prize 
in the form of more extensive national markets. He uses this to 
considerable advantage, compensating the original costs. Thus 
all members of the federation ultimately benefit, and this is 
why they are interested in it. 
  It should be added that this nature of relations (with some 
specific singularities, understandably) is characteristic of 
other federations also--the United States, Germany, Switzerland, 
Austria, Australia. 
  Of course, the CIS is not a federation, not even a 
confederation, and only coordinating, not supranational, bodies 
are possible within it. Yes, a lesser contribution of Russia to 
the common pot is, consequently, justified as yet. But, on the 
other hand, the CIS is a unique organization: Its participants, 
even having become independent states, are tied to the Russian 
Federation by the umbilical cord of many centuries of economic 
and other relations and interdependencies. In so closely 
interwoven a common space the guiding role of Russia is 
justified. If we are all thinking in categories of voluntary 
reintegration, and this has been the case thus far, we should 
not, in any event, be taking abrupt steps back, moving back in 
order subsequently, possibly, to take a step forward. But it is 
this problem, apparently, that has arisen for Russia--this, by 
appointment, nucleus of the Commonwealth. 
<H5>  Recoil--Where and For What Purpose? </H5>
  Unfortunately, a struggle of common sense and, in addition, 
the lessons of world development against irrational 
improvisations continues in the Russian position in respect to 
the CIS. Consequently, the Commonwealth is at times recognized 
as a legitimate child, with whom hopes for the future are 
linked, what is more, at other times it suddenly comes to be 
slighted as a foundling and sponger. 
  It is well known what has as of late served as a stimulus to 
a strengthening of the trends of attraction on the periphery of 
the CIS. Disenchantment with the euphoria of the sovereignties 
and a growing understanding that it is easier to cope with 
difficulties together. All the harder does what began as of the 
middle of last year--opposite impulses of rejection from the 
center--lend itself to a rational explanation. 
  There was in July 1993 a relapse into the Belovezha 
syndrome--a new statement of the "Slav trio"--on this occasion 
concerning urgent measures to strengthen only its economic 
integration. This was followed by attempts by Moscow to impose a 
"new-type" ruble zone on the rest of the participants in the 
CIS. According to the conditions of its formation, the Russian 
Federation could use these states' credit liabilities to place 
an important part of their economies under control. Another 
condition of Russian credit was the conclusion with CIS 
countries of dual-citizenship agreements. It was said here that 
we had not thought up such conditions, the entire international 
credit system works on the basis of them, and that linking 
policy with economics is a normal practice. 
  This is not true. First, as far as it itself is concerned, 
the Russian Federation is justifiably rejecting the attempts by 
the creditors of the London Club to sell its assets overseas for 
the debts. Second, the demand for dual citizenship in respect to 
25 million citizens of one country who suddenly, through no 
fault of their own, have found themselves abroad is without 
precedent. The main thing is that while in no way helping them 
specifically, it even makes their position worse, putting the 
corresponding states, a substantial part of whose population 
would thereby become "semi-foreigners," on their guard. Similar 
claims were not made on Estonia and Latvia, incidentally, where 
severe discrimination against the Russian-speaking population is 
being openly directed by the governments. 
  It is not surprising that both Russian conditions set the 
CIS 
countries in respect to credit were rejected. Following this, a 
policy of evicting the malcontents from the ruble zone was 
adopted, and all was crowned this March by a statement that the 
burden of leader of the CIS does not suit Moscow. 
  As of the present there are more questions than answers in 
connection with so abrupt a development. But the reflections are 
highly disturbing. What is the reason, for example, for priority 
being given the creation of an ethnic Slav union? The 1,000-year 
history of the multinational Russian state has known of no such 
reference point. This could be a mine beneath the fate of the 
Russian Federation itself. Why, further, is it acceptable to 
impose in the CIS the patronage of an older brother capable of 
dictating his terms to the younger ones? To be honest, this is 
akin to the imperial approach which we have sacredly forsworn. 
Finally, does not all this mean virtual renunciation of a 
full-fledged Commonwealth and its death knell? It is not, 
evidently, from having nothing better to do that the president 
of Kazakhstan, a convinced supporter of the CIS, has put forward 
the alternative idea of a Eurasian Union. 
  One thing is certain--ignoring realities is dangerous. Only 
in close interaction and on an equal basis with other countries 
of the CIS, not in isolation from them, in confrontation with 
them even less, is Russia's own revival conceivable. 
<H5>  Potential of the Commonwealth </H5>
  There are three main reasons why Russia's emergence from the 
multidimensional crisis is possible only in cooperation with the 
other countries of the CIS. 
  First, the imperatives of world development, with which 
Russia should proceed in step, not against the current. These 
amount to the fact that only extensive regional (meaning regions 
of the world) markets afford real prospects of economic growth. 
This is why the United States, despite all its colossal 
possibilities, preferred to join forces with Canada and then 
with Mexico also in the NAFTA trade and economic bloc. In turn, 
Germany, France, Britain--also great economic powers--agreed to 
unity with other states within the framework of the European 
Union. In this context the sole possibility for Russia of not 
withering away with its ailing economy and not suffocating from 
a lack of oxygen is to have its own regional market in the form 
of the CIS. The time of "lone wolves" in the world economy is 
gone. 
  Second, the tasks of ensuring national security push in the 
same direction. The collective interaction of the states of the 
CIS is a dependable common shield. Arguing from the opposite: 
Members of the Commonwealth, abandoned to the whim of fate, 
would have even fewer chances than the Russian Federation of not 
finding themselves plunged into chaos. But acquiring thereby an 
"encircling lichen of conflicts" along its entire perimeter 
would be most unpropitious surroundings for Russia. Such as it 
has never known throughout history and should not know, even 
less generate. 
  Third, as regards the geopolitical dimension. In short: 
Unless the Russian Federation is the leader in its region of the 
world, so much more will it not be a power of truly world 
caliber. 
  An adjustment of the impulsive actions, based on elementary 
miscalculation, is needed. A journey in the turbulent waters of 
world economics and policy cannot be started by jettisoning the 
lifesaver.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS Report: "Forecast from Vienna: Better Times Will </F>
Have to Wait"] 
  [Text] After the catastrophic year of 1993 for the economic 
development of the CIS countries, tne coming year will also not 
bring a significant improvement in the situation of a majority 
of the republics, according to experts from the Vienna Institute 
for Comparative Analysis of the World Economy. 
  In the report published here on the results of research they 
carried out, it is noted that the decrease of Russia's gross 
national product, which was 12 percent last year, will slow 
somewhat and will comprise 7 percent. The average level of 
inflation will drop from 880 percent in 1993 to 500 percent. 
  As for the other countries of the CIS, they can expect a 
larger economic slump than last year. One of the reasons for 
this, in the opinion of the institute's specialists, is the cut 
in deliveries of raw materials and energy from Russia, which 
will lead to growth in prices and acceleration in inflation. As 
it is noted in the report, in 1993 the general volume of gross 
national product in the CIS countries dropped 10 percent and the 
output of industrial prodcution decreased 14 percent. The 
average level of inflation comprised 1,450 percent. 
  According to results of last year, the decrease in gross 
national product in Ukraine comprised 15 percent; in Belorussia 
[Belarus]--9 percent; in Moldavia [Moldova]--4 percent; in 
Uzbekistan--3.5 percent; in Kazakhstan--13 percent; in 
Kirghiziya [Kyrgyzstan]--13.4 percent; in Tajikistan--21 
percent; in Armenia-- 9.9 percent; and in Azerbaijan--13.3 
percent. Positive results were noted only in Turkmenistan, 
where growth in GNP comprised 7.8 percent. 
  The situation in the labor market looks somewhat better in 
the CIS countries than in other states of East Europe. However, 
the reason for this, in the experts' opinion, is because of the 
very slow formation of the structure of a market economy. As a 
result, as in the past a large number of inefficient jobs are 
maintained at enterprises. According to official data, there 
are almost 1.2 million unemployed people in the CIS countries. 
But hidden unemployment is much higher because many people are 
on unpaid or partially paid leave. 
  As a whole for the 1990-1993 period, according to data from 
the institute, the volume of industrial production in the CIS 
countries decreased almost 40 percent. This is more than during 
the U.S. "Great Depression" of the 1930s.

and officials who permit such violations of this Law, bear 
liability as stipulated by prevailing legislation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Ideas of Communism Are Alive in </F>
Ukraine"] 
  [Text] The results of the latest elections in Ukraine 
attest to the fact that the ideas of communism are still alive 
and--at times--prevail. Why is that? 
  In the opinion of respondents questioned during a 
republic-wide investigative poll, the most attractive features 
of the communist regime were as follows: economic stability, 
guaranteed work, and the absence of nationality-type or ethnic 
conflicts. That is to say, it concerns what is lacking nowadays 
(with the partial exception of the last-named factor). Only 8 
percent of those polled consider that communism had no positive 
traits at all. 
  In order to gain a more complete idea of the image of 
communism which had been formed in the social consciousness, the 
respondents were also requested to cite its most negative 
features. It turns out that communism's "greatest sin" is its 
bureaucracy (so think one-third of the respondents), as well as 
oppression of the people and corruption. Some 13 percent have 
remained steadfast and unshaken dreamers about the cloudless 
serenity of the communist past. 
  Such a distribution of opinions is combined with an overall 
decrease in the adherents of the communist idea. Their number 
has been reduced by more than two-thirds and now 
amounts--according to data drawn from the above-mentioned 
poll--to approximately 15 percent. Moreover, 11 percent have not 
yet determined their own political priorities. In contrast, the 
proportion of communism's opponents has doubled and now amounts 
to 74 percent. One-third of all the supporters of communist 
ideas comprise pension-age respondents, whereas only one-tenth 
of those under the age of 30 maintain such a political 
orientation. It is noteworthy that among former communists 
nowadays there are twice as many persons who are indifferent to 
communist ideas than there are faithful adherents to these ideas 
(the figures are 60 percent and 30 percent respectively). 
  The logic of those voters who cast their ballots for the 
communists is roughly as follows: "Since the democrats and the 
members of the independence movement were incapable of providing 
us with a better life, I am voting for the communists, that is, 
for the good old days." However, few of these voters really 
think that those communists who suceeded in being elected to the 
office of deputy will carry out their pre-election promises. 
  By the way, the telephone number to call in order to 
contact the Sotsis-Gallup organization in Kiev is: 28-64-32.

<F P=106> [Article by Stepan Romanchuk: "Ukraine Was the Big Loser in </F>
the Elections"] 
  [Text] Contrary to the bold statements made by the leaders 
of the Ukrainian National Democracy, the democrats suffered a 
stunning defeat in the 1994 elections. The Rukh faction in the 
parliament has now been reduced from 60 to 28 persons, the 
Democratic Party went from 30 down to 5 persons, and only the 
URP [Ukrainian Republican Party] maintained a stable number of 9 
persons. However, the left-wingers are celebrating a clear 
victory. Whereas in the old parliament the left-wing portion of 
the political spectrum was represented by the ideologically 
vague "Group 239," nowadays we have 118 precisely oriented party 
deputies (from the KPU [Communist Party of Ukraine], SPU 
[Socialist Party of Ukraine], and SelPU [Peasants' Party of 
Ukraine]) plus an unknown number of non-party persons. 
  Having received a push in the Donets Basin, the left-wing 
wave rolled all the way to Kiev, where--even though an absolute 
majority of the voters did cast their ballots for the 
democrats--only 5 of their deputies out of 23 were elected. The 
reasons why the National Democrats lost at least 16 seats in the 
capital have become evident following an analysis of the results 
of the second round of balloting. In Kiev elections took place 
only in those districts where there were political contests 
between candidates. In those places where two representatives of 
the National Democracy were contesting a seat, or where 
democrats were running against members of the UNA [Ukrainian 
Assembly] the left-wing voters ignored the elections. The split 
between the "Ukrayina" bloc, which includes Rukh pro forma, and 
Rukh itself, which decided to play its own election 
game--placing the party principle above all else--together with 
a 50-percent rate of visiting election wards, worked to the 
advantage of the communists' successful tactics with regard to 
disrupting the elections. The great amounts of money spent by 
Rukh in printing up posters with pictures of its candidates in 
the second round of balloting (candidates which the people 
called the "blue team" because of the color of the paper used) 
and on distributing them by the state services did not justify 
themselves: In 21 districts only 3 Rukh persons were elected, 
and--judging by the political circumstances--they would have won 
anyway, even without the above-mentioned posters (their 
opponents were communists). 
  The struggle for Kiev's seats will be continued in the 
runoff 
elections, which--most likely--will be held in the autumn. The 
National Democrats in the new parliament will attempt to alter 
the electoral law in such a way as to reduce the 50-percent 
barrier of voter attendance and the 25-percent quota for 
determining a winner. The left-wing faction--not being 
interested in the Kiev representation--will act as quickly as 
possible to prevent changes in the above-mentioned law, basing 
their arguments on the position that a precedent must not be 
allowed whereby a single Supreme Council is to be elected by two 
different legislative norms. Therefore, unless Rukh revises its 
principle of "One's own party is closest to one's own skin" 
prior to the runoff elections, we can anticipate a new 
disruption of the elections in Kiev. And that would mean a new 
victory for the communists' tactics. 
  The National Democratic leaders' habit of palming off their 
defeats as victories (in the case of the past elections as well 
as in the case of their unsuccessful attempt to conduct a 
referendum on a pre-term re-election of the parliament in 
December 1992) could play a bad joke on them and on the entire 
state. The communists evidently will strive to reinforce their 
own success and will press for holding the presidential 
elections also on 26 June. They will either put up their own 
candidate or else support Kuchma's candidacy for the post of 
chief of state. But if these elections do not take place, or if 
a president is not elected (realistically speaking, the 
candidacies of Kravchuk, Plyushch, and Kuchma have approximately 
equal chances, whereas the candidacies of Chornovol, Lukyanenko, 
and Yukhnovskyy cannot be viewed as serious), this will provide 
grounds for the left-wing faction to attempt to abolish the post 
of president. Without a doubt, the communists--together with 
their left-wing allies and the Kuchma-Hrynyov faction--will 
bring up the question of forming an economic and political union 
with Russia and federalizing Ukraine. A hundred deputies from 
the non-party "party of power" will obviously support them 
because they lean toward whatever side is the strongest. The 
"struggle for the party of power," which has been proclaimed by 
the Rukh leaders, seems to be lost ahead of time. 
  The results of the 1994 elections signify not only a 
communist revenge; they also threaten the very existence of the 
Ukrainian state. And--analogously to this--the fact that the new 
parliament has lasted for three or four years, despite numerous 
attempts to overthrow it. The tactics of the National Democracy 
have failed utterly, and it is extremely important that its 
leaders come to understand and acknowledge this. And they must 
revise the strategy of their own political activities in 
accordance with this. For one can be a radical, a liberal, 
a fighter for justice, as well as a buffoon on the political 
stage; but to leave power in alien hands is dangerous for 
Ukraine and for its citizens. Nor do childish games in the 
"blue team" and lists of candidates from variegated parties 
create grounds for anticipating that power will someday pass 
into the democrats' hands.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleh Shmid: "The Election Became a Kind of </F>
Revenge"] 
  [Text] A parliamentary election is always a war of ideas. 
But in Ukraine, for some reason, it resembles a civil war. Two 
camps, two mentalities, two dissimilar halves of Ukraine are 
seeking revenge against each other over some wretched people's 
deputies, who have been fiercely shot at from all sides. We must 
acknowledge the following fact: In this election the Dnieper 
River has historically divided our state into two huge election 
districts. Success in one of them was turned into defeat in the 
other. 
  More than half--64 out of 120 deputies from the left-wing 
parties--have been elected to the parliament in just 4 Eastern 
Ukrainian oblasts: Lugansk, Donetsk, Kharkov, and Zaporozhye. 
Two-thirds of the people's deputies with a right-wing radical 
orientation--8 out of 12--have been sent to the new parliament 
from just 2 Galician oblasts--Ternopol and Lvov. But the people 
closer to the Dnieper, in general, did not want to vote for 
anyone: Most of the election districts with incomplete voting 
are in the city of Kiev--18, as well as in the Kiev--7, 
Dnepropetrovsk--13, Poltava and Vinnitsa (6 each) oblasts. 
Crimea was an utterly unique case. Twelve districts in that 
peninsula failed to reach the point of complete voting. 
  The first conclusion to be drawn here is as follows: Ukraine 
has not yet brought forth such a powerful political force which 
could unite the two societies living on the different sides of 
the Dnieper. However, it has already brought forth left-wing and 
right-wing radicals who are capable of transforming the Dnieper 
into a frontline. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  The most contentious analysts have already calculated 
that--out of the 337 persons newly elected to the 
parliament--almost 200 acknowledge their membership in a certain 
political party or election bloc with a precise political 
orientation. The people, whom the parliament of the previous 
convocation shamelessly burdened with a majority-type electoral 
system, openly voted not so much for a specific candidate as for 
his political bent. This is precisely the most suitable moment 
for drawing our second conclusion: Our people are not stupid, 
and they are capable of coping with party lists. Therefore, 
during future elections we will hardly be able to neglect the 
proportional principle in forming a parliament. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  Eight-tenths of the National Democrats who have made it to 
the parliament should understand the following point: Their 
strength lies in the "swamp." The latter is populated by 
approximately 100 deputies with an indeterminate political 
orientation, predominantly from the camp of the "independents" 
or the "party of power." Whoever carries most of the "swamp" 
over to his own side will have a parliamentary majority. 
However, a spectrum analysis of this Ukrainian "swamp" yields 
some disturbingly gloomy conclusions: There is a great deal of 
red coloring here. And, therefore, the chances of profiting from 
additional votes from the "swamp" are possessed by the 
left-wingers--the Communist and Socialist parties, as well as by 
the Peasants' Party of Ukraine--whose proportion in the Supreme 
Council will amount to 120 persons. They lack only 50 votes to 
create a parliamentary majority.... 
  From everything mentioned above the third conclusion 
presents 
itself: The National Democrats ought to be made aware that they 
have lost this election. Their principal tasks in this 
parliament are not to allow the communists to lead our country 
back to a point from which there is no return. That is to say, 
they must endeavor to block whatever anti-Ukrainian or 
anti-market decisions which may be made, while creating--at the 
same time--alliances, when necessary, with the "party of power," 
the National Radicals, and--at times--even with the 
Inter-Regional Bloc for Reforms. The main thing is to resist 
temptation and to reject those two or three offers to work in 
the government--offers which will undoubtedly be made to the 
National Democrats at the time when the ministerial portfolios 
are being distributed among the communists and the "party of 
power." This is the simple hook which last year caught many 
persons ready, willing, and eager to butt their heads against a 
stone wall and which--in Eastern Ukraine created the myth of the 
"Benderist-Nationalist" government in Kiev, a government in 
which the only protectors and defenders of the people are 
Zvyahilskyy, Landyk, Yevtukhov, and some other honest brothers. 
  The best thing that the National Democrats could do for the 
government is to keep quiet and remain satisfied to see how the 
communists attempt to extricate Ukraine from its economic 
crisis. In order to sense its own fall, our people evidently 
have to fall to the very bottom. And when everybody comes to 
understand that this really is the bottom, perhaps a new 
election will be called. The people must finally learn how to 
change their rakes--how to substitute new ones for the old ones. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  The greatest danger for Ukraine lies in those oblasts on the 
Dnieper which had 113 election districts not voting completely. 
Whereas the present-day parliamentary game of solitaire still 
allows for a blockage of openly anti-state or communist sudden 
moves, several dozen Leninists or chauvinists elected in runoff 
elections could totally shatter this delicately balanced glass. 
If the pendulum begins to swing in the other direction, and the 
people rush to elect right-wing radicals, war will begin in the 
parliament and end in a slaughter throughout Ukraine. 
  There will be no fourth conclusion. Each person is capable 
of 
drawing it on his own.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Grigoryants by Marina </F>
Pavlova-Silvanskaya; date and place not given: "Extraordinary 
Mission"] 
  [Text] At the request of Crimean leaders, well-known 
Soviet dissident Sergey Grigoryants had a meeting with Chairman 
Mustafa Dzhemilev of the Crimean Tatar National Assembly and 
Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovilov. 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] What kind of relationship do you have 
with Mustafa Dzhemilev and Vyacheslav Chornovilov? 
  [Grigoryants] All of us were political prisoners at one 
time, 
and although I was never incarcerated with either of them, we 
were members of the same small segment of society and had a 
common cause in the 1980s. 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] What connection do you have to Crimea 
and its present leaders? Why did you agree to mediate? 
  [Grigoryants] Oh no, I have no special connection to Crimea, 
other than sentimental feelings and ties of friendship. I was 
asked to do it by Ye. Saburov, who has been my friend since we 
went to school together. He named me Yu. Meshkov's political 
adviser (because the Crimean Constitution does not provide for 
the office of foreign minister). He came up with a conclusive 
argument: "Do you want another Karabakh there?" Although, if the 
disagreements of politicians there should lead to a conflict, 
God forbid, it will be more like Yugoslavia than Karabakh. 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] When did the idea of this 
extraordinary 
mission come up, and who came up with it--Ye. Saburov or Yu. 
Meshkov? 
  [Grigoryants] It was Saburov. When Meshkov came to Moscow 
soon after the election, he asked him to head the Crimean 
Government and also agreed to my participation in it. After that 
Saburov and I went to Crimea. I visited Dzhemilev in 
Bakhchisaray on the very first day and then spent five days 
meeting with Chornovilov, Tanyuk, Kuchma, and 
Altunyan--representing the whole range of Ukrainian 
politicians--and with the Russian and French ambassadors. The 
newspapers were right to underscore my meetings with Dzhemilev 
and Chornovilov, however, because it was the Ukrainian 
nationalists and the Crimean Tatar groups that aroused the 
apprehensions of Meshkov and Saburov. I feel there are no 
particular reasons for this, with the possible exception of 
Stepan Khmara's party. In spite of the fact that I have known 
him a long time, I did not have a meeting with him. 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] In a recent interview in our newspaper 
a Crimean politician had this to say in reference to the results 
of the presidential election in Crimea: It would be wrong to 
consider the opinions of only Dzhemilev's followers because his 
assembly has not won the undivided support of the Crimean 
Tatars. Their position grew stronger at the time of the last 
election, however. Was your mission a signal that Meshkov and 
Saburov want to "build bridges" with the assembly after the 
earlier exclusive affiliation with Kiev and the Rukh? 
  [Grigoryants] I went there before the election, but you 
should not assume that Meshkov and Saburov have the same policy 
line: Their objectives do not always coincide. During my very 
first conversation with Saburov, I was surprised by precisely 
the position you mentioned. That is why Meshkov intends, they 
say, to include two of the Tatars from the opposition to the 
assembly in the government. This is one of the "convenient" 
options in the style of Gromyko and Razumovskiy, the standard 
Soviet policy of finding collaborationists who demonstrated 
their inefficacy long ago. The Tatars are the only deported 
nationality that spent decades preparing its youth to return to 
their homeland. We have to negotiate with the people who 
represent the Crimean Tatars and their strength, and not with 
turncoats who have no influence there. 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] Were you able to convince Saburov? 
  [Grigoryants] It was easy to change his mind.... 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] What about Meshkov? 
  [Grigoryants] He also agreed right away. Of course, they did 
not believe that an amicable conversation with Dzhemilev was 
possible, but the talks could not have been more friendly. 
Dzhemilev also had his doubts about the possibility of 
negotiating with Meshkov, although the Crimean president's 
acknowledgement of the need to seek a new option indicated the 
opposite. 
  The underestimation of Dzhemilev's amicability and good 
sense 
could be a major mistake. The Tatars have several different 
affiliations, and these go beyond the communists and Dzhemilev. 
Besides this, we have to remember that more than 6 million 
people who call themselves Crimean Tatars are living in Turkey. 
This is a serious political situation, and the low number of 
Tatars in Crimea (250,000) is no reason to give them less 
consideration than the Ukrainians or the Russians. I think this 
is a significant force with a remarkable leader. 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] How would you describe the political 
results of these talks? 
  [Grigoryants] I feel that the danger of war, which I was 
warned about in Moscow, does not exist at this time. There are 
no forces that want to fight with the Russians: At most, the 
Tatars will resort to civil disobedience, and the Ukrainians 
simply do not have the time or energy for this right now. They 
have extremely urgent problems of their own. There are a few 
small extremist groups, but no influential political current of 
Rukh's statute is planning any kind of aggressive actions 
against Crimea. If Simferopol does want to choose the correct 
pattern of economic development, which will lead to prosperity, 
there will be no objections. In particular, I found out 
something I did not know in Moscow: The killings in Crimea that 
we called political were actually a result of unscrupulous 
commercial activity. 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] Does that include the murder of Yuriy 
Osmanov? 
  [Grigoryants] Yes, it includes all murders verging on 
political assassinations when they are connected with money. 
Today people can work peacefully in Crimea, but there are 
serious potential dangers. The primary one is the deployment of 
two armies on the peninsula: the Russian Navy and the fairly 
sizable Ukrainian Army, which takes orders from Kiev. The second 
danger is the resistance of at least two nationalities--the 
Tatars and the Russians, who might have serious objections to 
any attempts to change the present status of Crimea. The 
Russians there are people who were raised on the military 
traditions of the Russian Navy. Although the Sevastopol Naval 
Academy was always supposed to be an all-union institution, half 
of its cadets always came from the local population. The final 
and third danger is the prospect of unfavorable developments in 
the relations of Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey, each of which has 
its own interests in the Black Sea region. 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] You returned.... 
  [Grigoryants] After a clash with the Crimean administration 
(I am not referring to Saburov). These people do not understand 
how to build political relations with other countries. They will 
not be able to pursue the policy I regard as the correct one. My 
meetings did not do much good: The Crimean administrators 
disavowed what I said with their own statements and actions. 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] Do you mean that your mission will not 
be continued? 
  [Grigoryants] Probably not. I do not see any real chance of 
this.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergiy Trashutin, from Kharkiv: "The Election in </F>
Kharkiv Marked the Victory of Kuchma's Capital over `Das 
Kapital' by Marx"] 
  [Text] The defeat of the National Democrats in the 
Kharkiv region was even more likely than that of the Reds. Even 
though the main struggle in Kharkiv took place between the Left 
and the coalition of the "money bags" gathered around the 
Kuchma-Grynyov bloc, the former were fatally short of money. 
Since businessmen made use of their unlimited financial 
resources and cornered all the mass media, the Left, lacking 
funds as well as brilliant personalities, fell back on unabashed 
populism. In the first round, this move was successful: the 
slogan "there was enough food and drink under the Communists" 
worked and allowed them to put through their candidates in 10 of 
the 14 local districts. Adding to this two representatives of 
the Ukraine Citizens' Congress, we have the complete list of 
opponents of the Kuchma-Grynyov clan, which in the first round 
had a 100 percent success rate in the region. 
  The runoff election was preceded by several noisy scandals. 
For instance, People's Deputy Filenko sued the trade union 
newspaper SOLIDARNIST for publishing calumnious information 
which allegedly influenced the outcome of the first round of 
voting. It was to no avail: he lost the runoff to First 
Secretary of the CPU obkom Kashlyakov. People's Deputy 
Meshcheryakov withdrew his candidacy in protest against what he 
called dirty methods of conducting the election campaign by his 
fellow-Reform Bloc member Grynyov. His detractors maintain that 
in reality Meshcheryakov did not have the means to fight a 
financial battle against the respected Volodymyr Borysovych on 
an equal footing. 
  Speaking of funds: Socialist Party candidate Milyukha 
declared on television that the money which the Inter-Regional 
Reform Bloc spent on the election campaign would have been 
sufficient to feed the population of Kharkiv for a period of one 
year. He also added that with that kind of money he would 
undertake to put his cat in parliament. As no one gave him that 
money, neither his cat nor Comrade Milyukha himself won a seat 
in parliament. The Kuchma-Grynyov people wound up their campaign 
by holding a rock party at the central square of the city, 
complete with fireworks and local and foreign stars, in order to 
attract young people. (Garik Sukachev was brought over from 
Moscow.) It did not work: young people looked at the spectacle 
but did not bother to vote. 
  The runoff election in Kharkiv marked the victory of the 
material (funds) over the ideal (even though it was the world's 
most progressive ideology). The Kuchma-Grynyov group won 5 
seats, the Communists 2 seats and the Socialists and 
Meshcheryakov followers 1 seat each. One more seat went to an 
independent candidate. 
  On the countryside, the political landscape was slightly 
different. There, the contest between the Left and the ruling 
party ended with the score of 8-5 in favor of the latter. One 
seat was won by an independent candidate. Among those who were 
elected from the ruling party we find People's Deputies Bandurko 
and Karasyk, the advisor to Prime Minister Suslov. There were no 
particular surprises here, except for the Chuguivskyy district 
No. 385 which elected a Communist, Raykovskyy, surprising even 
the local nomenklatura. 
  The runoff also produced a scandal, perhaps the loudest of 
all. Running and apparently winning in the Sovetskyy election 
district No. 376 was a noted democrat, liberal, etc., etc., 
etc., Volodymyr Grynyov. Let us not talk about the astronomical 
sums spent on his campaign: they could not be added up by the 
KRU, the CIA and the Central Bank of Ukraine working together. 
There were many other violations, the main of which was the fact 
that without the permission of the Central Election Commission 
the polls were kept open beyond 8 p.m. Thanks to this, a needed 
number was achieved to declare the election valid. But since 
this did not escaped the notice of the perturbed public, we 
should expect a flood of letters and complaints to the Central 
Election Commission. God alone knows how it will end, but it 
offers a good opportunity to investigate whether indeed our 
elections were truly democratic and not falsified. 
  Nonetheless, the most important outcome of the election was 
that there is no Red Dawn in Kharkiv. Neither the Left nor the 
ruling party passed in the city. Their base remains on the 
countryside, in villages where even today the collective farm 
chairman and the head of the village council lord over the 
population. But this is their legacy: only time will free the 
countryside from this plague.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Zverev, from Odessa: "In Odessa, There Is </F>
a Wondrous Team: Eight Marxists, Three Lawyers, Two Captains and 
a Shadow--One for Two"] 
  [Text] Of the 23 seats in the Odessa region, 4 remain 
unfilled after two rounds of elections, while the 19 elected 
people's deputies can be broadly divided into three groups. 
Eight hang out on the left, while eight others, who ran for 
parliament from various managerial entities, are on the right. 
It is an illusory right, and it is called so only because there 
is no real right wing in the Odessa delegation. This group 
includes many well-known names: Bodelan, Symonenko, Kudyukin, 
Plotkin, Hurvits, Hovorun, Popov and Honchar. Apart from them 
are the rest, the representatives of a Lawyer's Union: Shyskin, 
Evdokymov and Karmazin, who for the sake of speeding up reforms 
declared willingness to cooperate with all parties and movements. 
  Two weeks after the fright caused by the first round of the 
election we can breathe easier. All of a sudden, Odessa 
residents voted with wonderful moderation. New Russian 
demagogues, the writer Vershynin and the television star 
Vaserman, as well as more noisy Leninists Pylypenko, Prokopets 
and Anyshchuk failed to get into parliament. Those Communists 
who won seats in the Supreme Council are at least distinguished 
by party work or are authorities in the world of business. The 
two representatives of the Countryside Party as not so much 
party activists as kolkhoz chairmen. Only the leader of the 
city's Social Democrats, now People's Deputy Rychagov, is one of 
those who only know how to talk. 
  It is not even worth it to discuss the other eight. Almost 
all of them were early favorites and stuck in the memory of the 
people not so much by worlds but deeds. Maybe it was a mistake 
by Oleksiy Kostusev to stress the ephemeral "struggle against 
the mafia" and not his own practical activities in his election 
campaign. As a result, he suffered a defeat at the hands of the 
main object of his anti-mafia crusade, Yeduard Hurvits. 
  Today, it is hard to tell where the Odessa delegation will 
steer its ship. But it is clear as day that not everything that 
the candidates promised before the election will become reality. 
Everything will depend on two factors. First, on the balance of 
forces in parliament itself and, second, on how the big cheeses 
of the Odessa delegation, Valentyn Symonenko and Ruslan Bodelan 
steer it. Competition, not to say cold war, has been going on 
between them for a good decade. But now they may well declare a 
truce in order to protect together their regional Odessa 
interests against the encroachment by the powers that be in Kiev. 
  Yet, it is unlikely that they could remain neutral relative 
one another even for a short period of time. The elections for 
Odessa mayor and Odessa regional governor are approaching. Even 
though most likely neither Symonenko nor Bodelan want these 
posts, they will attempt to get their stand-ins elected to them. 
  For the rest, a violator of peace on the Odessa team may 
become the colorful head of the Zhovtnevyy rayon council Yeduard 
Hurvits. But it is unlikely that he could enter the competition 
for leadership. He has already been the shadow of Symonenko and 
the shadow of Bodelan. More recently, Hurvits has found it safer 
to hide in the shadow of Leonid Kuchma.

<F P=106> [Article by Ukrinform, Press Service of the President of </F>
Ukraine and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine: "Fuel for the 
Village"] 
  [Text] On 9 February, Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, performing the 
duties of the Prime Minister of Ukraine, convened a conference, 
in which issues connected with the securing of fuel and 
lubricants for the agro-industrial complex were reviewed. 
  It concerned the fact that the government has to secure 
delivery for the countryside of these materials in volumes that 
correspond to the contract for state purchases of agricultural 
production. All possible channels for getting energy supplies 
will be used for this--both in Ukraine, and from the countries 
of the near and far abroad. The transportation and other 
participating departments have been assigned to secure 
uninterrupted reception and unloading of petroleum products for 
agricultural consumers. Operative control over the work of the 
transportation production line has been established. 
  At the conference, it was announced that the necessary means 
for reducing costs of fuel and lubricants will be used. The 
prices for these will be set no higher than world prices. This 
must prevent an increase in cost of the supply of other 
production of the rural economy, coming from the new harvest. 
  Volodymyr Demyanov, Vice-Prime Minister of Ukraine, took 
part 
in the conference.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Shkarban, President of of the Association of </F>
Farmers of Ukraine: "`Inexpensive' Fuel"] 
  [Text] According to the decision of the Cabinet of 
Ministers of 9 February 1994, the exchange of farm production 
for material-technical resources is foreseen. The concern 
"Ukragrotekhservis" will realize this in exchange for the funds 
allotted for the financing of the state contract for the 
purchase of agricultural production. In particular, it is 
foreseen that 28.7 trillion karbovantsi will be used for the 
purchase of petroleum products, including 13.3 trillion 
karbovantsi for spring field work. From this sum, the Ministry 
of Finance has already paid 630 billion karbovantsi to 
"Ukragrotekhservis." This concern, which has great advantages in 
transportation and tariffs, buying hard currency at a fixed rate 
(12,610 karbovantsi per dollar), for the use of state resources 
for wheat storage and processing enterprises, would have to do 
this so that charges would not exceed 50 percent of the customs 
cost of the fuel. Therefore "Ukragrotekhservis" raised the price 
for petroleum products and gets 4.3 trillion karbovantsi for 
this from the producers, including 2.5 trillion karbovantsi for 
gasoline. This happened because the ratio of prices for so 
called "inexpensive" fuel is worse than the ratio of prices on 
the world market. For example, at the "inexpensive" wholesale 
price for diesel fuel of 3.9 million karbovantsi per tonne and 
the starting cost of grain at 1.29 million karbovantsi per 
tonne, the ratio becomes approximately one to three, while on 
the world market it is one to 1.5 (in the commercial structures 
of Ukraine, one to 2.12). 
  Reference to the point that, supposedly, the ratio of one to 
three will be lowered by future indexation is baseless, since 
there is no guarantee that, with the change in the price for 
grain as a result of indexation, the price for fuel will not 
also change at the same time. 
  In our view, it would be better if the state paid in advance 
with funds allotted in the budget (on the basis of a futures 
agreement) for the full price, equivalent to the world price, 
that part of the contract, which the producer transfers to the 
state as a pledge for the future harvest. 
  The agricultural producers have to consider seriously 
everything while making contracts for the sale of grain, 
sunflower and sugarbeet, so that another robbery of the 
villagers by state structures will not take place.

<F P=106> [Interview by B. Polishchuk with A. Pavlenko, assistant head </F>
of the concern "Ukragrotekhservis"; place and date not given: 
"Fuel: From Emergency to Emergency"] 
  [Text] 
  [Polishchuk] Anatoliy Andriyovych, because of the 
government's nonpayment of charges for production, farms could 
not get ready for spring in an adequate way, in particular to 
obtain the necessary amount of fuel and lubricants. A very tense 
situation developed. The government is trying to salvage things 
in an emergency fashion and has forced "Ukragrotekhservis" to be 
the fireman, so to speak. What has already been done? 
  [Pavlenko] To ensure spring field work under state contract, 
we have to supply to the villages 800,000 tonnes of gasoline and 
1,200,000 tonnes of sunflower oil. As of 29 March, 89,000 and 
350,000 tonnes, respectively, had been sent to farms. 
  [Polishchuk] Is this not too little? 
  [Pavlenko] The situation is not the best, but it is also not 
the worst. In Ukraine, there are still 600,000 tonnes of fuel at 
terminals. In a few days, 100,000 tonnes are expected from 
commercial structures. Chiefly, this is diesel fuel. The problem 
is to collect it in time and get it to the locations. The 
February-March schedule for supplying gasoline and sunflower oil 
will be achieved at 90 and 72 percent, respectively. 
  [Polishchuk] And the April schedule? 
  [Pavlenko] There is hope that we will manage it. In 
Feodosiya 
and Odessa, tankers are being unloaded. Every day up to 20,000 
tonnes of fuel arrive at the terminals, by rail. There is an 
agreement with Azerbaijan to supply it as exchange. 
  [Polishchuk] On what principles do the farms pay for fuel? 
  [Pavlenko] As was indicated in the government decree on 
supplying fuel, this is done by fixed prices: gasoline--4,150 
karbovantsi per liter, and sunflower oil--3,900 karbovantsi. 
  [Polishchuk] How is the distribution of the fuel going, by 
regions? 
  [Pavlenko] First of all, it has gone to the southern 
oblasts, 
where the work in the fields got going first. Now we are 
equalizing the situation in the other oblasts. 
  [Polishchuk] And how about lubricants? 
  [Pavlenko] There are problems. The issue is that their 
acquisition, as for gasoline and sunflower oil, has to be 
foreseen with funds allotted under state contract. 
Unfortunately, this was not done. Also, there is too little 
lubricating material. In Khersonska oblast, on a number of 
farms, because of dust storms, it became necessary to replace 
the lubricants in the tractors urgently. We are looking for a 
way out of this situation. We have already purchased 3,500 
tonnes of lubricants in Kremenchug. We got small amounts in 
Russia and at the Drohobych research plant, with their help, we 
will get more than 2,000 tonnes of base lubricants. An agreement 
has been made for Russia to supply 3,000 tonnes of lubricants in 
April. In this way, there will be enough in April. 
  [Polishchuk] It is a long road for the fuel and lubricants 
from the terminals and ports to the farms. Is there a mutual 
understanding between "Ukragrotekhservis" and the railroad? 
  [Pavlenko] We are still talking. An agreement with the 
railroad has been made. All losses in transporting the fuel go 
to a separate account for "Ukragrotekhservis." So, we have 
direct payments, which eases the situation of the farms. There 
are also certain complications. In particular, the old railroad 
statute, signed over thirty years ago, contributes to them. On 
account of this, the cisterns for fuel are not sealed. This 
leads to its being stolen on the road. There are many cases, 
where one quantity of sunflower oil or gasoline is indicated on 
the bill of lading, but on the spot it is indicated that some 
hundredweights are not in the cistern. 
  [Polishchuk] And are hands not being warmed by fuel allotted 
to the village, along the chain far from the terminal or 
cistern? It is being provided to the farms more cheaply. It is 
enough to let a certain quantity of fuel go through commercial 
structures and, without raising a finger, to get a few stray 
pennies. 
  [Pavlenko] We do not know about such cases. In fact, fuel 
goes by a long chain: oblast to rayon to farm. Maybe someone 
yields to temptation. But this fuel has a destination, under 
state contract, and every liter should be accounted for. 
  [Polishchuk] Your prognosis: will we not fail in a great 
extent of the spring work, through the supplying to the villages 
of fuel and lubricant materials? 
  [Pavlenko] I do not think so. I am more worried about the 
time when feed preparation and taking care of the planting 
begin. And we all have to now start thinking about this in 
advance, and not live from emergency to emergency. 
  P.S. After A. Pavlenko gave the interview and went urgently 
on a mission, we found out some quite telling information. It 
turns out, that a number of regions, including southern ones, 
where the work in the fields has gotten going more, were 
supplied with fuel as though it were precious droplets, at the 
same time that the Khmelnytskyy region was "inundated." For the 
last 20 days, 13,124 tonnes of sunflower oil and 3,232 tonnes of 
gasoline have come here, the most in Ukraine, and more than the 
Zaporizka, Luhanska, and Cherkaska oblasts combined. Is V. 
Bortnyk, the chief of the board of the "Ukragrotekhservis" 
concern, in this way "greasing" his own voters in the 
Khmelnytskyy region and winning the deputy's mandate?

<F P=106> [Article by V. Otsenko: "The Field Is Left without </F>
Fertilizers"] 
  [Text] The whole fall and winter, the government nurtured 
the villagers with promises: supposedly, from day to day the 
state will pay for the production supplied, it will take care of 
the supply of fuel, of mineral fertilizers, and other resources, 
before the beginning of field work. And now the time for going 
into the fields on a mass scale has begun. Through the lack of 
fuel in the winter a very small amount of organic fertilizers 
has been prepared. Perhaps it will be made up with mineral 
fertilizers. 
  "The situation with them is also critical," says V. 
Tyshkevych, the assistant head of the "Ukragrokhim" association. 
"In past years, the farmers and our staff began to prepare 
mineral fertilizers for spring field work in November. In the 
winter, all the problem areas were worked out. Everything got 
done without emergencies. Now things only get started at the end 
of February. There was not such tension and difficulty..." 
  Because of the state's delay in payments for plant and 
animal 
production, the farms did not have anything with which to 
acquire fertilizer. As a result, many enterprises held back 
their production, or sold their production to purchasers who 
were able to pay--to commercial structures and foreign firms. At 
an inappropriate time, on 11 February, the state decided to 
allot credits to the countryside. Even if all our mineral 
fertilizer plants work at full capacity, the demand for nitrogen 
fertilizers will be satisfied by May only at the 70 percent 
level, phosphorous at 50 percent, and potassium at 18 percent. 
  Many farms, especially in the western region, will not be 
able to renew winter grain in time and to the fullest extent. A 
large deficit in the harvest will mean a four month halt for the 
Rivne production association, "Azot." It was paralyzed by a lack 
of funds to pay for gas and electricity. Only at the start of 
spring, they got going here one aggregate for producing ammonium 
nitrate; the rest are standing still. 
  The farms in the south began field work first. However, the 
Horlivka production association, "Styrol," which services this 
zone, also will not help the farmers much. Of the 35 billion 
karbovantsi of state credits transferred to it, only 3 billion 
have been issued. 
  The enterprises which produce for Ukrainian farms are 
supplied with mineral fertilizers, gas and electricity at lower 
prices. Unfortunately, many plants often do not use the energy 
resources for what they are intended. For example, the northern 
Don production association, "Azot," every day produces fifteen 
hundred tonnes of ammonium nitrate, but the warehouses are 
empty. The fertilizers intended for spring fields go for export. 
  The Cherkasy production association, "Azot," and the Rozdol 
enterprise, "Sirka," unload oils for the countryside in 
unsatisfactory fashion. 
  Raw material for phosphorous fertilizers were purchased in 
Russia for 18.3 billion rubles, but the Sumy association, 
"Khimprom," the Rivne "Azot," the Vinnytsia "Khimprom," and the 
Kostiantynivka chemical plant, are not hurrying to take care of 
the production of these fertilizers. 
  The irregular natural of mutual financial payments at the 
intragovernmental level has left the farmers of Ukraine without 
potassium fertilizers. The production association, 
"Biloruskaliy," has broken off relations with Ukraine. The 
Kalush "Khlorvinil" and the Stebnytskyy potassium plants are too 
small, and the potassium fertilizers produced by them are of 
significantly lower quality than the Belarusian. 
  The impression has been created that it is not Ukrainian 
bread that railroad officials are planning to eat; otherwise, 
they would not behave toward the countryside in such a way, like 
racketeers. First, they began to demand payment raised several 
times for a carload, since supposedly it had not been reserved 
45 days in advance. Then they seemed to relent, but having 
loosened the reins in one case, they skinned them for other 
services. For example, they refuse to extend the railroad tariff 
which had applied up to 5 December of last year for the period 
of spring field work. Now, to ship fertilizers it is necessary 
to pay five times more. The department did not agree to 
establish the time for unloading cisterns with ammonia up to 
five days, as was the case earlier. With a lack of fuel and 
broken down auto transport, the farmer has to do this right 
away. Otherwise, there are fines. The extortion by the railroad 
men leads to mineral fertilizers, and in the final analysis 
prices for agricultural production, becoming much more expensive. 
  We have reached spring. The country's chemical enterprises 
has to send to the countryside, every day, 18,500 tonnes of 
oils, and are unloading only a third. Last year the Almighty was 
merciful and gave us a harvest. What can we hope for now?

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Geographical Sciences V. </F>
Baranovskyy: "Ukraine--Incidence of Disease Among the 
Population"] 
  [Text] The very concept of "health" is evaluated in 
different ways, and debates continue surrounding the concepts of 
"health" and "illness." The most expansive concept of "health" 
today was proposed by the WHO in 1963: "Health is a state of 
complete physical, spiritual and social well-being of the 
population, and not only the absence of disease and physical 
defects." 
  Significant structural-dynamic violations of human health, 
physical development and changes in the nature of the pathology 
of the population are taking place under difficult contemporary 
ecological conditions--a gradual rise, in the pattern of 
morbidity and mortality among the population, of the share of 
non-epidemiological chronic illnesses and a corresponding 
decrease in the share of infectious diseases. The causes for 
these phenomena include the fast pace of life and an 
acceleration of production rhythms. Disruptions of the 
ecological equilibrium and, as a consequence, increased 
nervous-emotional strain in the face of a certain 
conservativeness of the functions of the organism, occur as a 
result of the constant interference of man in nature, and could 
be the cause of complications in the health of the population. 
  Most indicators of health, as is well known, are of a 
negative nature (morbidity, mortality, invalidity etc.), giving 
an idea of the state of health versus an "opposite." The 
incidence of disease among the population is the most sensitive 
indicator describing the influence of the environment on man, 
but the statistical values are not always sufficiently reliable 
or comparable. Mortality, on the contrary, can be considered as 
a conditionally resultant influence of the environment. This 
indicator is subject to compulsory recording, with a uniform 
categorization of the cause of death accepted both in this 
country and abroad. The official indicator of the morbidity rate 
is calculated over a year per 100,000 population. It is 
subdivided into initial (first revealed) and overall (rate of 
illness, extent). The latter includes the morbidity rates of 
past years for a certain moment in time, and morbidity as 
revealed for the first time. 
  The map offered to the readers depicts the level of 
initially 
revealed morbidity of the population by oblasts, and its 
structure and dynamic over 10 years. The structure of the 
morbidity rate, as we see, is predominated by diseases of the 
respiratory organs, nervous system, skin, circulatory system 
etc. The structure of the mortality rate of the population 
presents a different picture. First is mortality from diseases 
of organs of the circulatory system, then newly created 
malignancies, accidents and others. 
  The analysis we performed showed that the territorial 
breakdown of the incidence of disease among the population 
correlates closely with the ecological situation in Ukraine. 
This question is considered in more concrete fashion in the 
"Medical-Biological Atlas of Ukraine," now completed by the 
author. It comprises text and map portions. The cartographic 
section includes the author's maps and maps that have been 
published by other specialists. The total size is 123 pages, of 
which 71 are maps, 45 of those by the author. The map scales are 
1:7,000,000 (one centimeter to 70 kilometers), 1:6,000,000 (one 
centimeter to 60 kilometers ) and 1:5,000,000 (one centimeter to 
50 kilometers). 
  The cost of publishing the atlas is about 3,000--5,000 
dollars U.S., and it will thus not be possible to manage without 
sponsors. An abridged, "newspaper" version of the atlas will 
come out soon as a special supplement to the newspaper ZELENYY 
SVIT.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Naydyonov, doctor of economic sciences, </F>
professor: "The Exchange Rate and Inflation"] 
  [Text] Inflation is the greatest social evil affecting 
Ukraine. It is ruining production and reducing the working 
population to poverty, while concentrating wealth in the hands 
of speculators, usurers, and swindlers. nflation is an economic 
mechanism of the mass plunder of the people and the primary 
accumulation of capital. 
  Recall, for example, how state enterprises were prohibited 
from establishing commercial banks under the guise of 
restricting commercial activity and were even forced to take out 
their shares after the banks had increased their starting 
capital many times over. And so they threw the pike into the 
river! No longer regulated, banks are growing rich on the 
usurious accumulation of capital. Every time that the need for 
regulating prices arises, the regulatory documents begin with 
provisions that benefit "liberalization." This is why the 
decrees on prices issued by the Cabinet of Ministers in December 
1992 and in December 1993 led to sharp price rises. 
  The banks and middleman dealers are making a fortune on 
inflation. As a result, they are pressing hard for the removal 
of anti-inflationary measures. The government is being subjected 
to harsh attacks in the mass media. 
  The state is being reviled most harshly for regulating the 
currency exchange rate and instituting foreign trade controls. 
Any attempt to curb the all-permissive activity in this sphere 
is labelled as "antimarket." Despite the fact that both these 
forms of state regulation are applied now, and have been applied 
in the past, by many countries with market economies. 
  Regulating the exchange rate of the national currency and 
foreign trade has a significant effect on the dynamics of 
domestic prices. The starting proportions for exchange of the 
currencies of different countries depends on the relations 
between the prices of goods that arrive as imports. Basically, 
the currency exchange rate should be such as to leave the seller 
indifferent in which currency he is paid for his goods. Thus, if 
the market price of a metric ton of oil is 100 dollars in one 
country and 10,000 rubles in another, the rate of exchange will 
be 100 rubles to the dollar. On the average, this ratio should 
be in effect for all goods. If you take the average correlation 
between U.S. and Ukrainian prices for a selection of 140 goods, 
the exchange rate (according to data for January 1993) should e 
254 karbovantsi to the dollar. This is the real base proportion. 
Then why is the actual karbovanets exchange rate much lower: at 
the end of March, 40,000 karbovantsi to the dollar at banks and 
43,000 on the black market? Because there is a growing, 
market-driven demand for the dollar. 
  Market business fluctuations are natural in a normal 
situation and do not deviate very far from price parity. Central 
banks and states can do away with undesirable disparities by 
means of currency invervention, interest rates, and other 
economic measures. But if the market rate deviates very far from 
the parity described, it has an increasingly opposite effect on 
domestic prices. If the exchange rate of the national currency 
has fallen by a factor of 1.5 and the dollar costs 381 
karbovantsi rather than 254, the price of all goods imported 
from abroad will increase by a factor of 1.5. If the government 
wants to lessen the effect of imports on domestic prices, it 
must act to stop the exchange rate of the national currency from 
dropping. 
  When goods are scarce and production volumes drop, market 
conditions cause the exchange rate of the national currency to 
fall as a result of an increased demand for imports. With its 
clumsy (or perhaps deliberately inspired?) actions, the state 
can escalate the demand for imported goods and foreign currency. 
This has been precisely the effect of the internal 
convertibility introduced by the Kuchma-Pynzenyk government. 
Given the existing shortage of goods, it is causing the demand 
for foreign currency to grow. 
  Should the government regard this play of exchange rates as 
inviolable if it wants to curb inflation? No, it should use 
every available means, including administrative measures, to 
halt the fall of the exchange rate of the national currency. In 
other words, it must regulate the exchange rate. To be sure, 
without disturbing the fundamental price parity and taking into 
account market conditions. 
  A second important factor that sharply increases demand for 
foreign currency is the fact that it circulates in the form of 
cash. The owners of foreign currency do not suffer from 
inflation. Because it is more stable, demand for it is growing. 
As a result, the price of the national currency is falling at an 
accelerated rate. The dollarization of monetary circulation is 
another factor that contributes to inflation. 
  In the year since the policy on foreign currency has been 
"liberalized" and the interbank currency exchange was opened, 
the rate at which the dollar is traded on the exchange has 
increased more than 90-fold (from 340 karbovantsi on 22 
September 1992 to 31,150 karbovantsi on 5 November 1993). This 
has had a marked effect on the rise of prices. During this same 
period, enterprises raised prices 85-fold. The fact that the 
rate at which the currency exchange rate is falling exceeds the 
rate at which prices are rising indicates that the exchange rate 
is not dependent on price parity but the other way around. This 
being the case, the exchange rate is of an opportunistic, even 
speculative, nature. 
  Russia raised the price of its energy supplies, setting 
itself the goal of bringing them up to world levels. The fall of 
the karbovanets exchange rate greatly intensified the effect of 
imported inflation. The steep jump in the exchange rate, which 
augurs catastrophe (from 5,970 to 19,050 karbovantsi to the 
dollar), occurred on 20 August 1993. In an attempt to neutralize 
this factor, the government and the National Bank of Ukraine 
established a fixed rate of exchange for the karbovanets. This 
was an inflexible decision that drew criticism. It was followed 
by the introduction of a regulated -- that is, deliberately 
fluctuating -- exchange rate, and the currency auctions were 
halted. 
  Unfortunately, however, this measure designed to halt the 
continued fall of the exchange rate was not applied 
consistently. Instead of the interbank currency exchange, the 
commercial banks were permitted to trade in foreign currency. 
This created something like a decentralized exchange. The 
interests of exporting enterprises have been disregarded. They 
are obliged to sell half their export receipts at the official 
rate of exchange (12,610 karbovantsi), yet buy the currency they 
need to purchase raw materials, materials, and components at the 
bank rate of exchange (37,000-40,000 karbovantsi). 
  When the Cabinet of Ministers was deliberating on the draft 
of the presidential decree, the recommendation was made to 
either establish individual quotas for enterprises for the sale 
of foreign currency (depending on the nature and structure of 
shipments of products under subcontracting arrangements), or 
sell hard currency to exporters at the same rate at which they 
had bought it. However, for some reason, there is no mention of 
this in the decree. 
  The dual system of exchange rates creates losses for 
exporters and produces dissatisfaction among them. Some circles 
deliberately interpret this as dissatisfaction with the 
principle of state regulation of the exchange rate, even though 
this is not the case at all. Is this another mistake or a 
deliberate gap? I cannot state for certain, but I suspect that 
it is the worse of the two. In fact, it is not the regulation of 
the exchange rate that should be opposed, but the retention of 
two different rates (at least not for exporters). But it is 
precisely regulation that public opinion hotly opposes. 
  Another inconsistency in the policy of regulating the 
exchange rate is the failure to make any attempt to put a stop 
to the circulation of foreign currency in Ukraine. 
  The paramount task in the war against inflation is to use 
every available method to curb the rise of prices. The thing is 
that price increases are no longer the result of inflation and a 
feature of it, but the cause of rising inflation. The rise of 
prices increases costs, creates a shortage of working capital, 
and results in the chain of nonpayments. This leads to a decline 
and halt in production, which causes prices to climb even 
higher. Or it makes it necessary to supplement working capital 
with credits, which increase the money supply and also cause 
prices to rise. No matter what kind of anti-inflationary 
measures are applied, they are nullified by the momentum of 
price increases. That is why it is necessary to resort to direct 
administrative restrictions on price increases. Especially on 
the price of a specific commodity -- foreign convertible 
currency. The government has done precisely that. And it was 
right to do so. But this measure must be implemented in a 
comprehensive and consistent manner. 
  Many countries resort to mandatory state regulation of 
foreign currency exchange rates. At present, 73 countries link 
the exchange rate of their own currencies to the exchange rate 
of one of the hard currencies, six rely on a flexible link using 
a number of indices (Ukraine could join this group), and eight 
countries regulate floating rates of exchange. As we can see, by 
far not all countries allow unregulated floating exchange rates. 
A country has to protect its economy. 
  There needs to be a will to fight the crisis. If we indulge 
in theoretical whining, we will not overcome the problem. 
  In all fairness, we have to admit that Yu. Zvyahilskyy is 
succeeding in curbing the rate of inflation by applying an 
aggregate of measures. In January, inflation measured 19 
percent, in February, 13 percent. Estimates show that it should 
be down to nine percent in March as against 90 percent at the 
end of last year. And the regulation of the foreign exchange 
rate is a vital factor in this stabilization. Attacks on the 
egulation of currency exchange rates are organized by those who 
are living off inflation. This is an assault on the people by 
robbers. But the government, too, needs to correct the purchase 
and sale of foreign currency so as not to oppress exporters and 
not increase the demand for foreign currency.

<F P=106> [Crimean Republic Presidential Edict No 38/94 on Banks and </F>
Banking in Crimean Republic, signed by President Yu. Meshkov in 
Simferopol on 11 April 1994] 
  [Text] Pursuant to subsections 10-13 of Section 2 of the 
Law of Ukraine "On the Delineation of the Powers of Government 
Agencies of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic" and in accordance 
with the first paragraph of Edict 228/93 of the President of 
Ukraine of 23 June 1993 "On the Open Economic Policy Within the 
Territory of the Crimean Republic" referring to the creation of 
an open economy in the Crimean Republic, envisaging the 
liberalization of foreign economic financial and banking 
relations, 
  I hereby decree that: 
  1. The banking system of the Crimean Republic will be part 
of 
the banking system of Ukraine, will operate on two levels, and 
will consist of the Republic Bank of Crimea and commercial banks 
of various types and forms of ownership. 
  Banks of all forms of ownership within the Crimean Republic 
will be guided in their actions by the laws of Ukraine and the 
Crimean Republic, by this edict, and by other legislative 
instruments issued in accordance with existing laws and 
regulating banking operations. 
  2. The Republic Bank of Crimea will be owned by the Crimean 
Republic. The Republic Bank of Crimea will be autonomous of the 
National Bank of Ukraine in its activities (with the exception 
of the right to issue currency, which will be the exclusive 
prerogative of the National Bank of Ukraine). 
  The Republic Bank of Crimea will pursue state policy in the 
areas of monetary circulation, credit, and settlements and will 
regulate and oversee the activities of commercial banks within 
the confines of its jurisdiction. 
  For the performance of its duties, the Republic Bank of 
Crimea will take part in drafting state programs for the 
economic and social development of the Crimean Republic, the 
state budget of the Crimean Republic, the payment balance sheet 
of the Crimean Republic, and other state programs with a 
possible impact on the state of monetary circulation. 
  3. The Republic Bank of Crimea will do the following: 
  --plan and carry out measures to regulate the volume and 
structure of the total amount of money in circulation by means 
of the appropriate consultations with the National Bank of 
Ukraine. 
  The regulation of the volume and structure of the total 
amount of money in circulation will be accomplished by changing 
the amount of credit extended by commercial banks; buying and 
selling securities and foreign currency; changing the standard 
limits on the compulsory reserves of commercial banks in the 
Republic Bank of Crimea; changing the interest rates of the 
Republic Bank of Crimea on its credits; and imposing limits on 
the credit investments of commercial banks; 
  --service the state debt of the Crimean Republic by 
conducting operations connected with the extension of state 
loans of the Crimean Republic, the repayment of these loans, and 
the payment of the interest on these loans; 
  --collect cash and other forms of payment for the state 
budget of the Crimean Republic and organize and carry out the

<F P=106> [Report by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA correspondent Georgiy </F>
Dorofeyev: "The Energy Crisis. Let Us Remember the Power of 
Wind"] 
  [Text] The Slavyanskiy Plant of High-Voltage Towers has put 
into production wind-driven power-generating systems. It is 
currently completing the first order placed by Wind-energo, a 
joint Ukrainian-American enterprise, for 50 systems, which will 
be incorporated into the power-generation system of Crimea. The 
first three systems are already undergoing testing, and the rest 
are coming up. 
  One such system, set up in a steppe, coastal, or mountain 
area where the average daily wind force reaches 5 meters a 
second, produces 1,500-1,700 kw-hours of power a month; an 
alternative method of production would have required 600-700 kg 
of coal or 150-170 kg of diesel fuel. 
  It is easy to calculate what kind of economy 50 such systems 
will deliver. Wind-driven power-generating systems means power 
generation without smog, high culture, and a clean environment. 
  It is not accidental that other organizations have also 
become interested in the production of alternative 
power-generation systems. The plant recently received another 
order for 350 such systems. They can work either as part of a 
grid or autonomously, for individual use. Naturally such systems 
will be in great demand among farmers, members of cooperatives, 
and on collective farms located far from major consumer power 
grids. A rival to fuel-based power generation is being born.

<F P=106> [Oleg Stepanenko report on interview with Belarusian Prime </F>
Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich: "The Way Out of the Crisis Lies in 
Union With Russia"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- "I will be put on trial," Vyacheslav 
Frantsavich said with bitter irony when we met. 
  I already knew this to be the case: National-Radical 
deputies have approached the Prosecutor's Office, demanding that 
he be charged with treason against the state. Specifically for 
signing a treaty on a unified monetary system with Russia, one 
paragraph of which -- concerning the status of the national bank 
-- contradicts the relevant article of the Constitution. 
  It seems that his life since he was elected chairman of the 
Council of Ministers of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic 
nearly four years ago has been composed entirely of dramatic 
events. His attempts to salvage the economy -- the decline in 
production, inflation, the decline in living standards, the 
constant attacks from the right wing and the national reformers, 
and the criticism from the left.... "You adapt to living as if 
under fire in a trench," he confessed to journalists. 
  But whereas these years which have washed like a destructive 
wave over all the former republics of the Union, have seen 
several heads of government in Belarus' neighbors, starting with 
Russia, come and go, Kebich has survived. Because he has 
occupied a key post for all this time, he has naturally had more 
of a chance than many others to make sense of the processes that 
have brought society to the brink of disaster. 
  From the vantage point of his accumulated experience, how 
does he currently view the ways and means for getting Belarusia 
out of the crisis and providing its people with a decent life? 
This was the question, a question of interest to all of us, 
that I put to Kebich first of all. 
<H5>  There Is Only One Way </H5>
  [Kebich] Basically, the only way I can see is close union 
with Russia, the establishment of an effective model for the 
economy and a just society. This is the main thing. 
  [Stepanenko] You would put union with Russia first? 
  [Kebich] Yes. Without it Belarusia has no future. Blood 
kinship, shared roots, and age-old unity with the Russian people 
are not the only issue here. We are united economically. 
Almost all our energy resources, raw materials, and the bulk of 
our components come from Russia, and two-thirds of our products 
are sent to Russia. The destruction of the Union and the 
disruption of economic ties is a tragedy whose disastrous 
consequences are being felt in all the republics; it is a 
tragedy that has become an economic Chernobyl for Belarusia. 
Our only salvation lies in integration. The unification of 
monetary systems, for which, as you know, I had to fight all the 
way, is just the first step in the direction of full economic 
union with Russia. If you like, this is the only realistic way 
not only of surviving, but also of retaining our sovereignty. 
[Kebich ends] 
  Just the day before, during a meeting with industrialists 
and 
entrepreneurs who nominated him as a candidate for the 
presidency, Kebich issued a sharp rebuke to those who have 
kicked up a fuss about the "crimes" of a government which, by 
signing a treaty on the monetary system, has supposedly deprived 
the republic of its sovereignty. And he voiced his profound 
conviction that Belarusia actually lost its sovereignty 
following the breakup of the Union, when it became 
"independent," because disorder and poverty are a road to 
servitude and total dependence on others. Opponents of economic 
union with Russia, he noted in a subsequent talk with 
journalists, are prisoners of medieval illusions. 

    [Stepanenko] But why unite with Russia alone? After 
all, there was a time when you advocated economic union within 
the framework of the Commonwealth. 
  [Kebich] I have not given up on this idea. But you will 
recall how the politicians conducted themselves: They all 
destroyed even what was enshrined in the agreement on the CIS -- 
a single economic area, a single ruble, and joint Armed Forces. 
With every summit meeting I became more and more convinced that 
national ambitions and selfishness were being put first. 
Everyone was in it only for what they could get out of it. I 
realized that we needed to come up with another, more realistic 
option. Without destroying the Commonwealth, within its 
framework, those who are more prepared to integrate, for 
example, and whose economy basically compels them to do so as a 
result of objective ties, should draw closer together. And I 
put forward the idea of an economic union of Russia, Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan, and Belarusia.... [Kebich ends] 
  This was Kebich's idee fixe. He plugged it whenever he 
could: He secured the approval of the Supreme Soviet and 
discussed the concept on several occasions with Chernomyrdin, 
Kuchma, and Tereshchenko. The planned union of four, and 
subsequently, owing to the deterioration of the situation in 
Ukraine, three, was open to other CIS member states, and was to 
have been the basis for a subsequent economic union of all 
Commonwealth countries. But it proved impossible to set it up. 
Whereupon Kebich concentrated his efforts in just one direction 
-- union with Russia. 
  [Kebich] Of course, we will go further -- we will completely 
restore the single economic area and single economic organism. 
I am sure this will accelerate the unification process on a 
Commonwealth-wide scale. Here in Belarusia, this system will 
enable us to keep alive the largest enterprises and whole 
sectors such as those involved in radioelectronics, 
machine-building, and oil refining. Russia too will benefit: 
It will not have to establish industries paralleling the ones 
operating here, nor will it have to shut down enterprises 
working in collaboration with Belarusia. 
  The second condition for getting ourselves out of the 
crisis, 
as I have already mentioned, is the establishment of an 
effective model for the economy. And here, I think, we need to 
rid ourselves of one or two illusions. 
<H5>  You Cannot Be Wiser Than Life </H5>
  [Kebich] First and foremost we need to openly acknowledge 
that the economic model proposed by the radical reformers is 
bankrupt. Let me be more specific: A policy geared to 
indiscriminate destruction of the past and all the forms and 
principles of the previous economic system is not only 
wrongheaded, it is actually ruinous. This is borne out by 
everything, by the way the production situation is developing 
and by experience -- our own experience, I mean not just 
Belarusia's, but the experience of all former Union republics 
and world experience as a whole. 
  Let me begin with an extremely obvious fact. This model has 
not achieved success anywhere on the territory of the former 
USSR. On the contrary, the more the model has been applied, the 
more the economy has fallen apart. We, for example, immediately 
refused to adopt the ideas put forward by the radical marketeers 
-- wholesale liberalization and total privatization. And we 
thereby prevented the kind of collapse we are seeing among our 
neighbors. 
  [Stepanenko] But your opponents claim that until recently 
Belarusia was being helped along by cheap Russian oil. 
  [Kebich] Excuse me, this is just political speculation and 
deception. For Russia and its enterprises, oil and gas were 
even cheaper, but production there has declined at a far quicker 
rate than in Belarusia. 
  [Stepanenko] Specialists say the fact that the republic 
survived and did not go under with just 4 percent of its own raw 
materials and components is nothing short of an economic miracle. 
  [Kebich] To a certain extent it really was a miracle. It is 
important to understand why. We kept to the safety margin that 
we had in the previous economic system. Let me remind you that 
back in 1989 the national income grew by almost 8 percent and 
was probably the highest in the world. Despite all the 
distortions and deformations which for dozens of years were 
imposed on this economic system, its healthy foundation, and 
particularly its planning system, demonstrated its advantages. 
In order to extricate ourselves from the crisis, we intend to 
bolster rather than weaken this foundation. How did Franklin 
Roosevelt extricate the U.S. economy from the crisis caused by 
the elemental forces of the free market? By planned programs, 
and control and regulation of prices and interest rates. 

    Even today in West Europe, EEC countries' agricultural 
production prices are planned and handed down from Brussels. 
And what about the Southeast Asian market and the Japanese 
economic miracle? Once again, it was achieved with the help of 
extremely vigorous and soundly based scientific planned 
regulation. Quite frankly, I was amazed by a fact I learned not 
so long ago. Almost 30 years ago in Canada our workers 
witnessed an operation where, in the space of just four hours, 
information was collated on the quantity, range, and quality of 
footwear all over the country, as well as the demand for these 
products -- and this information was then used to make forecasts 
and adjust plans. 
  [Stepanenko] So apparently in Canada they threw all their 
intellectual resources and all the structures of state and 
science into combating the elemental forces of the market? And 
in our country these things have become disconnected? 
  [Kebich] Precisely. And now, in order to extricate 
ourselves from the crisis, we need to make the connection again. 
It is time for us to say good-bye to the euphoria over private 
property, which is alleged to be the only way of creating real 
owners and ensuring the best results. World experience has 
dispelled this illusion long ago. In many developed countries 
almost half the enterprises are owned by the state and operate 
no less efficiently than private ones. And what about 
agriculture? Nowadays it should be clear to anyone that the 
best results are achieved on state-owned land in Holland and the 
state-run cooperatives of Israel. China has fed 1.5 billion 
people without private ownership. And the production indicators 
of people leasing land (in West Europe this accounts for almost 
50 percent) -- and I stress leasing, not owning -- are no worse 
than the indicators of those who own it. 
  What about our Belarusian experience? Despite all our 
shortcomings and making do with far less equipment than Western 
farmers, the republic's kolkhozes and sovkhozes have produced 
150 percent more milk per head of population than all the farms 
in the United States. And we have caught up with them in terms 
of the amount of meat produced per head of population, you know. 
<H5>  Mistakes Must Be Corrected </H5>
  [Stepanenko] Nevertheless, Vyachaslaw Frantsavich, Belarusia 
has also given ground. Laws have been adopted opening the way 
for private ownership and a privatization program.... 
  [Kebich] You know, if all forces -- our own "democratic 
reformers," the Russians, and the world community -- are 
pressuring us, one single country taken separately, and moreover 
a country without raw materials and energy resources, it is 
practically impossible to resist all alone. The government, of 
course, is to blame, but primarily because it was the government 
during this difficult period. 
  It is even said that I am against the market. No, I am not 
against it. The market exists in all modern countries. There 
was even a market in the USSR. I am opposed to the kind of 
market which has been foisted on us by the radical democrats. I 
am convinced that privatization should not be imposed by force. 
At the meeting I had with industrialists, for example, they 
expressed their opposition to the privatization of a number of 
major enterprises. I said: Let the labor collectives decide. 
A program is a program, and life is life. But we have not 
permitted private land ownership in agricultural commodity 
production. Only on personal plots and gardens, but these are 
basically privately owned anyway. We have taken account not 
only of the greater efficiency of collective forms of ownership, 
but also the unificatory commune principles inherent in the soul 
of the people and the Slav mentality. 
  [Stepanenko] This ties in directly with the theme of a just 
society, the need for which you spoke at the beginning of our 
talk. 
  [Kebich] Yes, I am convinced that unless we pursue a policy 
of building a just society, we will never climb out of the pit. 
It sometimes seems to me that we are standing on the edge of a 
moral abyss and spiritual catastrophe. Today immorality has 
become the rule, trickery and deception are commonplace, and 
cynicism is a virtue; an amazing change has taken place in 
people of all social groups. Ugly economic relations primarily 
engender legal and moral thuggery. We need to struggle against 
this. We must not place a nuclear bomb under the economy which 
will blow society to smithereens. We must not divide society 
even more into rich and poor -- it has already been divided 
enough. We need to correct our mistakes, honestly acknowledging 
that they were made chiefly in important matters rather than 
trifles. 

    [Stepanenko] So then, Vyachaslaw Frantsavich, do we need 
to make adjustments or completely change course? 
  [Kebich] What, is it better to persist in wandering off on 
the wrong track? Right now a reappraisal of what has been done 
is already under way. People in Russia are beginning to 
overcome the consequences of the narrowly monetarist approach of 
the shock-therapy reforms which destroyed the economy. I am 
sure that the bitter experience of the recent perestroyka and 
reformist eras will help us to find the right way to extricate 
ourselves from the crisis. And I hope we will come out of it 
alongside Russia rather than separately.

  [Text] We the people of the Republic of Belarus, 
proceeding from responsibility for the present and future of 
Belarus, recognizing ourselves to be a full subject of the world 
community and confirming our commitment to values common to all 
mankind, taking as a basis our inalienable right to 
self-determination, relying on the age-old history of the 
development of Belarusian statehood, endeavoring to firmly 
establish the rights and liberties of each citizen of the 
Republic of Belarus, and wishing to ensure civil harmony and the

based on the rule of law, adopt this constitution--the basic law 
of the Republic of Belarus.

region will have to be recognized in some capacity has appeared 
in Kishinev [Chisinau]. In what capacity is the question. This 
was the topic of an interview for a ROSSIYA correspondent 
granted by Ion Botnaru, first deputy minister of foreign affairs 
of Moldova. 
  [Petrova] Many people are saying that, following the 
parliamentary elections and the Consultation With the People 
poll, the situation in Moldova has changed and that it is now 
highly propitious for a solution of the conflict between the 
banks of the Dniester. Do you also believe this? 
  [Botnaru] Yes, I too believe that extra incentives for a 
resumption of the process of dialogue have appeared. Why? First, 
the results of the poll confirmed once again that we will not 
unite with Romania. The realization of the poll was an 
accommodatory step toward and, I would say even, a concession to 
the left bank. 
  Second, a consensus of political forces came about during 
the 
elections, in my opinion. Everyone already recognizes that 
special status is necessary for the Dniester region. 
  And, third, which political party could within six months or 
a year be considered to be coping with its obligations as the 
country's ruling party unless there is a change in the 
situation? That is, from the political viewpoint the possibility 
of a solution of the conflict is very favorable. 
  [Petrova] All the negotiations between Chisinau and Tiraspol 
have become frozen in a discussion of the conditions under which 
they should be held. Are there fears that things will get no 
further this time also? 
  [Botnaru] Yes, because the Left Bank perceives each 
concession of ours as a display of weakness and, 
correspondingly, demands the next concession. But there should 
be a different view of the situation: We are not weak, we are 
adults and we recognize how dangerous the situation is, and we 
are for this reason agreeing even to contacts with illegal 
structures--just as long as the "cart" of the negotiations 
starts to move. Now, after Russia has displayed good will and 
the CSCE has expressed its recommendations, the process of 
negotiations should move ahead. 
  [Petrova] What kind of status is Moldova prepared to offer 
the Dniester region? 
  [Botnaru] First and foremost, the status of the Dniester 
region must in no way impinge on the territorial integrity of 
the Republic of Moldova. Consequently, there must be one 
constitution, a common foreign policy, a common monetary system, 
a common macroeconomic policy, and common borders and customs. 
We must take account of the variegated ethnic composition of the 
population of the country and the existence within it of areas 
with the compact residence of Gagauz, Bulgarians, and 
Ukrainians. If we take the path of comminution, we will create a 
very dangerous precedent for Europe. We can, however, find 
formats whereby the local structures operate in the central 
government. 
  [Petrova] But the Dniester region is as yet sticking to the 
idea of a confederation or, at least, a federation and declaring 
that such an arrangement of the state would not mean a violation 
of its integrity. 
  [Botnaru] The declarations concerning a federation are 
connected more with a desire to preserve some structures. But if 
there is a common budget, and it must be common, the need for 
the elimination of all parallel structures will naturally arise.

<F P=106> [Article by Rita Grumadaite: "Number of Officials Assigned </F>
to Land Reform to be Supplemented"] 
  [Text] Lithuania will remain a country using atomic energy, 
at least until the year 2004-2007, when its exploitation will 
end. This is foreseen in the Program for Restructuring the 
National Energy Complex approved yesterday at a meeting of the 
government leadership. Deputy energy minister S. Kutas, the head 
of the program, indicated that measures would be implemented to 
increase reactor operation safety during the period of time 
foreseen for the operation of the Ignalina atomic energy 
station. A decision on the continued use of nuclear energy is 
expected to be made in approximately five years, when 
international experience will have formulated a clear opinion 
regarding the future of atomic programs and when very safe and 
reliable nuclear installations will have been created. 
  Plans call for completion in 1994-1995 of formerly halted 
construction on the third and fourth blocks and the upper 
reservoir of the Kruonis power plant. As S. Kutas told LIETUVOS 
RYTAS, the cost of this work is nearly $30 million. However, 
this sum includes the amount already paid to purchase some of 
the necessary equipment. There will also be incentives for 
projects dedicated to the assimilation and use of water, wind, 
and geothermal energy. In the coming two decades, specialists 
are planning to decrease approximately by half the amount of 
energy consumed to produce one unit of national production. 
  After the draft for a health insurance law was presented, 
the 
attendees of the meeting noted the absence of a financial 
analysis for the draft. Prime Minister A. Slezevicius indicated 
that "large amounts of money were involved and this threatened 
an increase in taxes." The draft foresees two types of health 
insurance--compulsory and voluntary--with supplemental health 
care services compensation on the basis of a voluntary contract. 
  Because this version of the future law "takes into account 
insurance traditions as well as the experience that the world 
has gained in the past 100 years," as its authors noted, it 
differs from the alternative drawn up by the Social Democrats. 
L. Alesionka, a member of the Seimas Health, Social Affairs, and 
Labor committee, also criticized that alternative version, 
asserting that he supported the draft being presented at the 
meeting "as a physician and a future patient", and proposed that 
the working group give "a detailed explanation of the mechanism" 
to the members of the leadership. The proposal was accepted and 
the draft will be deliberated again in May. 
  167,600 litas from the government reserve account was 
earmarked to increase the wage fund for the executive and 
government institutions of cities and district local 
governments, in order to be able to hire more workers at 
agencies that are organizing land exploitation. According to 
agriculture minister R. Karazija, one specialist is no longer 
able to both prepare and record in time the legal documents 
associated with land ownership and land use--"they are falling 
behind because there are not enough workers." As long as the 
right of ownership is not recorded and the lots are not marked 
on the land cadaster map, the land market will not be able to 
operate and there will be problems in resolving disputes. 
  Nationwide, 350,000 house possessions have to be 
legitimized, 
and about 50,000 farmers want to settle their land ownership 
matters each year. 
  Transportation minister J. Birziskis responded: why should 
the number of officials be increased, perhaps it would be 
worthwhile to reassign them in a more efficient way? In 
response, R. Karazija said that there is no precedent for the 
case of returning all the land in Lithuania. 
  At the meeting, amendments were approved to laws allowing 
citizens to receive monetary compensation for still existent 
real estate that they had previously owned. However, Kaunas city 
deputy mayor J. Vengraitis reiterated how urgent the problem of 
recovering ownership of buildings is in the cities, especially 
in Kaunas. Property owners there want to regain ownership of 
about 1500 houses. If an incredibly large sum of money--10 
million litas--were allocated each year to the local government 
there, this process would take 18 years. He presented a radical 
proposal by the Kaunas city council--to settle with the owner 
for his property at the market price, but to discuss financial 
issues related to the return of property after a corresponding 
portion of state property had been privatized for cash. 
  Although finance minister E. Vilkelis--who was chairing the 
meeting then in place of the prime minister, who had 
departed--said that "the train had already left the station" and 
that such a discussion should have taken place before the laws 
being amended on this day were adopted, the proposal received 
the support of industry and commerce minister K. Klimasauskas, 
and subsequently also the support of others--"the train can 
still be caught." 
  The minister believed that it would be worthwhile to try to 
sell at least 10 percent of property for cash. The industry and 
commerce ministry as well as the economics ministry were charged 
with preparing drafts of such a proposal. 
  2 million litas in this year's state budget are earmarked 
for 
implementation of the Restitution Act. The constitution also 
recognizes other traditional religious communities, so these 
funds are also allotted to traditional non-Roman Catholic 
confessions, taking into account their approximate number of 
adherents and the requests of the heads of the religious 
communities. A resolution was approved at the meeting, on the 
basis of which the Supreme Orthodox Council of Lithuania, the 
Protestant Lutheran Consistory, the College of Reformed 
Protestants, the Greek Rite Catholic Community, the Karaite 
Religious Community, the Orthodox Eparchy of Vilnius, the 
Vilnius Sunni Muslim Community, and the Vilnius Jewish Religious 
Community will also receive some of this money.

<F P=106> [ELTA agency information: "The Country's Economic </F>
Development in March"] 
  [Text] Vilnius, 12 April (ELTA)--Compared to February, 
there was a 23 percent increase in March in sales of extracting 
and processing industry production, considerable increases in 
loads transported by rail, ocean-going, and river 
transportation, and increases in animals, poultry, milk, and 
eggs bought, according to ELTA, citing information provided by 
the Statistics Department of the government of the Republic of 
Lithuania. 
  With respect to farms nationally, there was a 38 percent 
increase over February in animals and poultry (live weight) 
bought, and a 30 percent decrease compared to March a year ago. 
20 percent more milk was bought than in January, and the 
increase in eggs bought was no less than 44 percent. 
  There was no less than a 20 percent increase in loads 
transported by ocean-going vessels, a 6.6 percent increase for 
loads going by rail, and a 4.6 percent increase for loads going 
by river transportation. 
  According to initial data, the turnover of retail goods in 
comparative prices increased in March by 17.3 percent, whereas 
it had decreased by 4.6 percent in February, as compared to 
January. 
  In March there was an increase of 3.9 percent in the number 
of individuals unemployed and seeking work, while the number of 
registered unemployed decreased by 2.5 percent, and the number 
of available jobs increased by 3 percent. The latter figure 
points to a positive trend, since in February, the number of 
available jobs had decreased 14.4 percent. 
  The consumer price index in March 1994 was 103.3 when 
compared to February, and 111.4 when compared with the end of 
last year.

<F P=106> [Article by Arturas Racas: "As They Express Their Lack of </F>
Confidence in the Government, the LSDP Faction Also Indicates a 
Way Out of the Crisis: a Broad Coalition"] 
  [Text] At a press conference held yesterday at the Seimas, 
Social Democratic faction representatives A. Sakalas and V. 
Andriukaitis acquainted the journalists with documents related 
to the procedure of no confidence in the government that this 
faction is initiating. The journalists were also informed that 
13 Seimas members had already signed the text of the declaration 
of no confidence in the government, and that seven additional 
members intended to sign in the near future. (The signatures of 
29 members of Seimas are required for the Seimas to take up 
deliberation of the issue of no confidence in the government.) 
  Seimas deputy chairman A. Sakalas set forth the main 
principles on the basis of which the Social Democrats were 
expressing their lack of confidence in the LDDP government. 
According to him, the current government did not implement its 
strategic pledges and did not present a vision of the future of 
Lithuania. "We do not know what kind of industrial structure is 
foreseen for Lithuania, or what Lithuanian agriculture will be 
like and whether the effort will be exerted to make it 
effective. We also do not know what kind of banking structure we 
will have," A. Sakalas noted. In his opinion, the government has 
heretofore said nothing about the development of the services 
system, or about solving transit problems, including military 
transit. There was also nothing being said about the creation of 
free economic zones, the development of infrastructure, or the 
problems of employment and unemployment. 
  Also, according to the head of the Social Democratic party, 
the government was operating without adhering to the program 
that it had adopted. 
  He asserted that in the wake of the actions of the current 
government, Lithuania has "eaten" its way to a $174 million 
debt, and that this debt will have to be repaid from the pockets 
of the taxpayers or by using new loans. "The economic crisis 
continues to deepen, and industrial and agricultural production 
is decreasing", A. Sakalas continued, noting that no one 
foresees when this crisis might end. He also characterized as 
fictitious the increase in residents' income proclaimed by the 
government, since about 70 percent of this increase was achieved 
by using foreign credits, and the remainder came from "eating 
up" the savings of residents and enterprises, as well as from 
the "economy" to compensate for unpaid taxes. 
  A. Sakalas is of the opinion that responsibility for the 
situation in the country also falls on opposition parties and 
that this responsibility takes various forms. These include the 
proposal by the conservatives to initiate early elections, 
something which A. Sakalas considers unrealistic at this time; 
or the suggestion to "pick off one minister at a time", which 
Sakalas says is being proposed by certain LDDP representatives; 
or simply operating on the basis of the principle "It's none of 
my concern" and observing the situation passively. According to 
A. Sakalas, the Christian Democrats have chosen this last route, 
asserting that "We did not appoint this government, and so it 
isn't for us to dismiss it either." The Social Democratic leader 
appraised that kind of position by the Christian Democratic 
party as "political impotence or hypocrisy in not wanting to see 
the poverty of the Lithuanian people." 
  When asked who might replace the government led by A. 
Slezevicius, V. Andriukaitis said that considering the extent of 
the crisis, "it is doubtful whether a single political force 
could or can lead Lithuania out of that crisis." He believes 
that no one political force currently has such a level of 
popular support that its proposed reforms would be accepted. 
  V. Andriukaitis noted that "the problem of coalitions is 
becoming the urgent concern for all political parties at this 
time." In his opinion, political forces could make a pact of 
concord for two years, regulate the decision-making process in 
the Seimas, form a new government, and confirm its new program.

<F P=106> [ELTA agency information: "70 Percent of All Enterprises in </F>
Lithuania Have Been Privatized"] 
  [Text] Vilnius, 13 April (ELTA)--Since privatization began, 
4524 enterprises, or 70 percent of all enterprises to be 
privatized, have been privatized. Privatized state 
capital--488.3 million litas--comprises 46 percent of all 
capital foreseen for privatization. 
  2133 large- and medium-scale enterprises (478.2 million 
litas) have been privatized through public subscription of 
stocks, and 2391 small-scale enterprises (9.9 million litas) 
have been sold at auction. 
  Of the large-scale enterprises that were privatized, 
547--the 
largest group--were industrial enterprises (288.1 million 
litas); 485 were construction enterprises (66.9 million litas); 
and 422 were commercial enterprises (39.2 million litas). 
  Of the enterprises sold at auction, 1050--the largest 
group--were commercial enterprises (3.6 million litas), whereas 
784 enterprises, with a capital of 2.4 million litas, were in 
the household services sector. 
  One-time payments by the state and other special-purpose 
compensations were being sold at the 4-11 April auctions for an 
average price of 48 cents. The highest price (60 centas) was in 
Vilkaviskis district, the lowest in Jurbarkas district (30 
centas). 
  The privatization department also announced that, in 
accordance with the government's 28 March decree "Regarding the 
indexing of the permanent assets and funds residing in 
investment accounts of enterprises, institutions, and 
organizations", the Central Privatization Commission had decided 
at its 8 April meeting to stop privatization of all enterprises 
whose privatization was to have started after 1 April, as well 
as of all those that were to announce a new public subscription 
of stock after 1 April or were to once again hold auctions after 
1 April. The founders of these enterprises are obligated to 
submit revised privatization programs for these enterprises to 
the Ministry of Economics by 25 April.

<F P=106> [Interview with Romualdas Ozolas, chairman of the Center </F>
Union, by Arturas Racas; place and date not given: "The Center 
Union is Focused on Not Yet Existent Individual-Oriented 
Entities and Does Not Intend to Represent the Large 
Capitalists"] 
  [Text] In a week's time, it will be exactly two years since 
the establishment of a centrist-oriented party in Lithuania was 
publicly declared. Exactly three months after that declaration, 
the constituent assembly of the Center movement took place on 22 
July 1992, and on 5 June 1993, the constituent conference of a 
political party, the Lithuanian Center Union. On 27 October 
1993, the Center Union was registered at the Ministry of Justice. 
  At present, there are over 400 members in the Center Union, 
which is represented in the Seimas by R. Ozolas and E. 
Bickauskas. 
  LIETUVOS RYTAS presents an interview with Romualdas Ozolas, 
Chairman of the Lithuanian Center Union. 
  [Racas] Of the political forces that currently exist and 
have 
representatives in the Seimas, the Center Union is the newest 
organization, and in addition, an organization which does not 
have a historical past. Why did Lithuania need the Center Union? 
  [Ozolas] The Center Union is a political organization that 
came into being and now operates on the basis of liberalistic 
viewpoints. On the whole, liberalism in Lithuania is quite a 
recent phenomenon and lacks deeper traditions here. In a country 
where the tradition of conservatism is fundamental, basic, and 
oriented towards far in the future, parties with liberalistic 
viewpoints and their adherents truly are choosing a very 
difficult path. We understood this from the outset, but we made 
up our minds to take this step nevertheless. We believe that we 
had to decide to take this step for Lithuania's future: whether 
Lithuania will be democratic or autocratic depends on whether 
the political viewpoint of liberalism--consolidated to at least 
some significant extent--exists here. 
  The right with its national conservatism and the left with 
its cosmopolitan conservatism automatically orient Lithuania 
towards a single party, and the battle between these two forces 
may determine the development of Lithuania for a long time. 
Since the left is--in terms of history--condemned, and the right 
is the position of future parties, we believe that it is 
improper and dangerous to repeat the political route taken by 
Lithuania up to 1940. So if we, understanding the prerogatives 
granted us by history and the necessity of resisting the pull 
towards repeating what was done in the past, do not carry out 
our duty, we, as political leaders, will not, on the whole, have 
justified our purpose, and as people we will not be able to rest 
in peace even after we are dead. 
  I believe that in rising as a third force, liberalism can 
guarantee the development of a third political force in 
Lithuania. I find it very unfortunate that the Liberal Union of 
Lithuania, by responding in such a strange fashion to the 
economic situation, has heretofore identified persistently with 
the right, even though the complex of issues associated with the 
left and the right in Lithuania has not yet become sufficiently 
clear. 
  [Racas] You are emphasizing the third, or the so-called 
middle way. What is it like, how does it differ from the ways 
that the left and the right are proposing? 
  [Ozolas] The right as well as the left are offering 
guarantees to aggregate wholes. We are offering guarantees to 
individuals--to individual-oriented entities. Through these 
guarantees offered to individuals, we are trying to provide 
guarantees for those aggregate constituencies that could then 
join together and be the leading forces for Lithuania as it 
moved toward openness, toward the world, towards the 
ability--through openness--to keep in step with a dynamic world 
that is on the verge of the 21st century. Despite the pull 
towards autocracy, that world will be democratic. This is also 
demonstrated by the fact that the great empires have collapsed, 
as we had predicted. The Soviet Union and its autocratism is 
already gone, and after some time, a similar fate, it seems, 
will befall China and its imperial structure, and still later, 
the United States, although, to be sure, on a different basis. 
  [Racas] You maintain that the Center Union is oriented 
towards individual-oriented entities. Keeping in mind that in 
the past elections you were unable to overcome the 4 percent 
hurdle, is it possible to assert that these individual-oriented 
entities do not yet exist in Lithuania? 
  [Ozolas] That's absolutely correct. Lithuania is for the 
time 
being still not prepared to live through the life of the 
individual person. For now, group life has to be guaranteed for 
Lithuania: guarantees for pensioneers, guarantees for the 
unemployed, guarantees for students and so on. The individual 
person with his willingness to take a risk, his intelligence, 
determination, and tenacity still has so few opportunities, that 
even the most determined are overtaxed by what they experience. 
  The Center Union represents that softened version of 
liberalism which could correspond to the self-consciousness of 
those who are the most daring and to their interests, as people 
who are determined to lead life as an individual, in growing, 
joining into groups or classes, and assuming a certain position 
in the structure of the society, in which the majority will 
nevertheless be comprised of those conglomerates that require 
collective guarantees. 
  [Racas] Why, despite accentuation of the idea of liberalism, 
has the Lithuanian Center Union been unable to find common 
ground with the Lithuanian Liberal Union? 
  [Ozolas] I believe that this is a question of time. The 
difficulties are sufficiently comprehensible in the sense that 
here in Lithuania everything begins with ideological viewpoints, 
and any difference whatsoever in these repels people from the 
possibility of joining forces or working together. There is a 
certain degree of hypertrophied seeking of identity in all the 
parties, so it goes without saying that this might be especially 
characteristic of the Liberals, who defend the freedom of the 
individual. And that is indeed the case. 
  We said a very long time ago, back when the Center movement 
was still forming and when positions were being deliberated with 
the Liberals, that despite everything our paths were the same, 
and that sooner or later we would find a way to cooperate. We 
will also find a way to cooperate with other centrist or 
moderately oriented forces. 
  Until all the rich and powerful people who wish to 
participate in political life come together, the Liberal Union 
will be able to represent liberalism in Lithuania more as an 
idea than as a concrete political effect. However, even then 
they will not be able to collect enough votes, and the moderate 
echelons of liberalism will be able to be suitable 
representatives for those too who will share the belief that the 
defense of their private life and initiative, as well as the 
defense and increase of their personal wealth is their life's 
purpose and meaning. This is why we characterize ourselves not 
as the representatives of the large capitalists, but rather as 
the representatives of the person who has wealth, as 
representatives of the individual, as representatives of the 
person who understands that wealth is not absolute, that it is 
only a means to live and to exist, and that it is the engine of 
society's becoming free. 
  [Racas] Could you give concrete expression to who these 
"people who have wealth" are whom you would like to represent? 
  [Ozolas] The structures of wealth in Lithuania have not yet 
manifested themselves completely and it is uncertain what they 
will eventually be like. We believe that we could represent 
people both in rural areas--large- and medium-size farmers--and 
in urban areas--financiers, factory owners, large stockholders, 
as well as the entire strata of workers in private 
infrastructure. In short, for that group of owners which 
requires a guarantee of free trade and assistance as well as 
defense at times when there is instability in the country. What 
will be especially difficult and crucial will be the 
reconciliation of the guaranteeing of interests of large- and 
medium-size capital. 
  [Racas] When the Center movement was being founded, its 
ranks 
included many people who were well-known then: K. Motieka, S. 
Kasauskas, M. Laurinkus, A. Januska, etc. How would you explain 
the fact that now they either do not participate at all in the 
activities of the Center Union or have suspended their work in 
this organization? 
  [Ozolas] I believe that this is related to the fact that 
participation in politics is a very difficult duty. Moreover, 
everybody has a lot of individual interests, everybody today is 
accumulationg starting capital for themselves, and some of the 
people mentioned are doing so as well. This is why I fully 
understand Mr. Kasauskas, who is concerned with the development 
of his personal business, I understand Mr. Motieka, who wants to 
put the activities of his firm in order so that he can be 
independent. Sometimes I think that when I leave politics it 
will be as a completely poor man, whereas my friends and many 
people in Lithuania will have in reality achieved the ideal for 
which I am working in politics. That is a paradox, but working 
in politics is what I have decided to do. 
  [Racas] Members of the Center Union work in various 
government structures and frequently express differing opinions 
and so politicians sometime say that a multipartite structure 
has developed within the Center Union itself. Isn't there a 
danger that your party will split up? 
  [Ozolas] Even parties that are less democratic than ours are 
threatened by divisions and differences of opinion. The way in 
which diversity of opinion is formulated in our party and the 
way in which we manage to act on this diversity as we coordinate 
differences of opinion is very satisfying. In surmounting the 
differences of opinion that we indeed do have, we manage to 
coordinate them not with respect to the sole category of current 
economic needs, but rather with regard to what will happen in 
the distant future. When difficulties arise, we work on the 
principal question: does our general line correspond to this or 
not? If it corresponds, then we don't argue about the details. 
This is why a split is truly not a threat to us for the time 
being, even though to our critics, the details usually seem to 
be especially significant. 
  I want to emphasize where our threshhold of confidence lies: 
working individually and on one's own responsibility up to the 
point where it is clear to everyone that the person might be in 
a position to go outside the viewpoints of the party. If the 
party believes that the person has nevertheless crossed this 
threshhold and that his viewpoints no longer correspond to the 
viewpoints of the party, then we raise the issue whether this 
can continue to be reconciled with the norms of the general work 
of the party. 
  [Racas] Elections to local government may take place this 
year already. How is the Center Union preparing for these 
elections and with which political forces does it foresee 
forming a coalition? 
  [Ozolas] We have always believed and will continue to hold 
to 
the viewpoint that no advance indications on this topic are 
needed. We let our sections operate freely in choosing election 
partners for themselves. Some sections will participate in the 
elections together with the Liberals, while others will join 
with the Liberals and the Social Democrats. They will, of 
course, not coordinate their programs but perhaps they will 
succeed in agreeing on how to act together on individual issues. 
  [Racas] How does the Center Union view early elections to 
the 
Seimas? 
  [Ozolas] We have a very clear opinion on this issue: for the 
time being, we can not support this idea, because we believe 
that if the elections took place this fall, they would not in 
the main change anything, and could possibly even make the 
situation in the Seimas and the country worse. This was also my 
opinion in 1992, when I proposed that elections not be held but 
rather that we work as hard as possible. 
  [Racas] Do you expect to overcome the 4 percent hurdle in 
the 
next elections and will you try to do so alone? 
  [Ozolas] Without a doubt. We will go into the elections on 
the basis of what is there and will also look for who can agree 
with us on the principal issues. Even if such agreement would 
only happen in the distant future, and even if for tactical 
reasons certain distinctions were to remain. If our positions 
coincide and if the other party can take part in joint political 
activity and can assume the task of taking care of a certain 
domain, that party will be our friend and participate alongside 
us. We see possibilities for cooperation with the Social 
Democrats, Nationalists, Democrats, and this does not even 
mention the Liberals. The question is whether the politicians of 
today will be able to overcome their mentality, step beyond 
their personal interests, and join and unite for the benefit of 
our country.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Okhotin: "Architects of Catastrophes: </F>
Scenario of Russia's Involvement in the `New World Order'"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Mondialism and Its Pressure </H5>
  It is no secret today that the degree of interference in the 
domestic political life of our country on the part of foreign 
governments and extragovernmental organizations is enormous. On 
the whole this phenomenon is characteristic not only of Russia 
but the world, and it is being imposed by "mondialism," that is, 
the aspiration of certain powerful financial and political 
forces to control the world ("mondialism" comes from the French 
word "monde," that is, "world"). This project is otherwise known 
as the plan for "world government"). 
  Specific organizations that are the most highly involved in 
the realization of mondialist plans are primarily the Bilderberg 
Club and the Trilateral Commission. It is these structures that 
formerly "proposed and realized" ("imposed") perestroyka in the 
USSR; it is they that via the United States, the IMF, and the 
World Bank and also via the "public" institutions and 
foundations that are dependent on them are attempting (and not 
unsuccessfully) to control domestic policy processes in 
present-day Russia. 
  There is no doubt that the activity of such "mondialist 
structures" does not receive extensive coverage but they are not 
strictly secret and they periodically reveal certain aspects of 
their activity via their publications--such as TRIALOGUE, THE 
FEDERALIST, AUSSENPOLITIK, THE WORLD TODAY, and so forth. 
  In recent years these mondialist journals have devoted the 
largest number of their articles to Russia and the former Soviet 
republics. This points to the immense significance the 
architects of "world government" attach to events in our 
country. Russian readers would be interested to learn what these 
architects think of our situation since, most regrettably, with 
the present government their theoretical plans become almost 
instantaneously our social reality. 
<H5>  Regional Triad </H5>
  Mondialists see the world as being divided into three main 
regions: American (with the domination of the United States), 
European, and Pacific (with the domination of Japan). It is for 
this reason that the main mondialist organization, the 
Trilateral Commission, is called trilateral: Its principal 
participants are the representatives of these three "developed, 
market regions." 
  These regions, in the mondialists' thinking, should in the 
future become the three columns of a single world state. But at 
the present stage they are assigned the role of the expansive 
absorption into themselves of the expanses that are 
"undeveloped" or "insufficiently developed." Russia, naturally, 
falls into the category of such "insufficiently developed" 
states from the market viewpoint. 
<H5>  Plans for Russia </H5>
  The mondialist authorities have two fundamental scenarios 
for 
Russia in the sense of its integration in the world market (and 
it is this that is the Mondialists' aim). The first plan 
anticipated a change in the economic structure of the former 
USSR and the transition to a market economy with the 
preservation of the political control of the former Soviet 
leadership and within the framework of a unified state. In this 
outlook a "democratized" USSR was to have blended into the 
regional European bloc. This was what Gorbachev was talking 
about when uttering words about the "common European home." But 
Gorbachev's fall forced the mondialists to abandon this version 
of the USSR's socioeconomic integration. 
  The second version was the disarticulation of the USSR and, 
subsequently, of the Russian Federation for the entry of the 
intraregional expanses into the various "market blocs"--both 
European and Pacific and even a direct "pro-American" bloc (of 
the colonies or protectorate type--this model was intended for 
the Baltic republics, Kazakhstan, and a number of oblasts of 
Russia). Gorbachev's incapacity for realizing the first plan 
forced the mondialists to concentrate on the second, which 
became the main strategic line of Yeltsin's policy. But there 
was a certain breakdown here also. 
<H5>  Communism, Democracy, and Nationalism </H5>
  The mondialist journal THE WORLD TODAY analyzed the 
stymieing 
of the second plan for the "mondialization" of Russia in its 
January 1994 issue. From the experts' viewpoint, the main 
obstacle to Russia's entry into the market is "collectivism," a 
quality that is not compatible with market individualist 
ideology and mentality. And this collectivism has been 
manifested at three levels, what is more. 
  There is historically in residual but strong form in 
Russians 
"communist-type collectivism" (first level). When on this 
instinctive collectivism the policy of "democracy" (second 
level), that is, another "collectivist" political form, was 
superimposed, a new type of collectivism--"nationalism" (third 
level)--was manifested. This occurred, what is more, not only in 
the Russian milieu but also among other peoples that were left 
in an uncertain state following the disintegration of the USSR. 
Consequently, new obstacles to subsequent mondialist integration 
in market regions arose in this version of fragmentation of the 
single political space also. 
  It was as a forced abandonment of democracy under such 
conditions (inasmuch as it indirectly contributes to the 
appearance of a new and very dangerous, anti-mondialist, form of 
"collectivism"--"nationalism") that the mondialists perceived 
the shooting up of the Supreme Soviet and the abrogation of the 
current constitution. The authors of THE WORLD TODAY and THE 
FEDERALIST make no secret of the fact that this was an 
antidemocratic measure, necessary, however, for combating 
"collectivism." 
<H5>  Crisis of Mondialism in Russia </H5>
  But even this extraordinary measure involving the shooting 
up 
of the parliament did not do much to improve the situation 
concerning Russia's membership of the "new world order." 
Nationalism has not been conquered (the results of the December 
elections are a striking example of this); the communist 
opposition has not surrendered; and democracy has not renounced 
its political embodiment (the critical position of certain 
democratic publications in respect to the liberal terrorism in 
October 1994 [as published] is an example of this). It was after 
December that a majority of mondialist voices began to talk 
about the "return of Gorbachev," that is, about the need to 
bring to power in Russia a force, obedient to the West, of a 
"social democratic" persuasion with the possible reconstitution 
of a "common space on the territory of the former USSR." Thus 
Gorbachev himself snatched from the opposition "Eurasian" 
slogans, which were also usurped by certain 
Yeltsinites--Shakhray, Stankevich, and so forth. 
  However that may be, the mondialists today believe that the 
second version of integration has failed hopelessly and that it 
is necessary to return to the first version or its new 
modernized form. 
<H5>  Patriotic Plan </H5>
  Patriots today do not have the right to ignore the plans of 
the mondialists since their strength both in the foreign policy 
and the domestic life of the country is immense. It is the 
mondialists who initiated the changes in Russia, which the 
people and the opposition resisted merely passively, constantly 
several moves behind. Today the mondialists are in crisis and 
they frankly acknowledge this in their semiclassified 
publications. The opposition must not miss its opportunity on 
this occasion. It is required not only to end the processes of 
the disintegration of the motherland for its inclusion bit by 
bit in a regional triad but also to prevent the "return of 
Gorbachev" or a "collective Gorbachev" in the shape of 
"centrists" and repainted "reformers" in the service of 
mondialism. 
  Russia's patriots must formulate their own plan of the 
country's future. But it should be remembered that the simple 
isolationism that existed up to perestroyka is hardly possible 
today. 
  The mondialists are strong and powerful. They would never 
permit this. The patriotic plan should, therefore, be, in my 
opinion, in a sense "international" and totally anti-mondialist 
since only the mutual solidarity of all the world's 
anti-mondialist forces--left, right, center, and so forth--can 
alter the fatal course of contemporary geopolitical 
transformations. Only the solidarity of various peoples and 
states of the planet united by a common desire and a common will 
to themselves determine their historical destiny and the 
particular features of their internal arrangement can be the 
alternative to "world government."

<F P=106> [Interview with Tatarstan's Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid </F>
Mukhametshin, by INTERFAX correspondent Guzel Fazullina, 
especially for IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA; place and date not given: 
"We Have a Responsibility to the People"] 
  [Text] The more time passes since the signing of the 
treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of 
Tatarstan, the more obvious it becomes that our republic has 
entered a principally new period in its sociopolitical and 
socioeconomic development, and that from now on many issues on 
which there had been no clarity will have to be decided not by 
someone else but by Tatarstan authorities. 
  Overall, the problems of implementation of the treaty 
between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan 
constituted the bulk of the discussions at the latest, the 19th, 
session of the Republic of Tatarstan's Supreme Soviet, where the 
1994 budget was discussed. Today in an interview to an INTERFAX 
correspondent, Tatarstan's Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid 
Mukhametshin gives his appraisal of the session's results and 
his vision of the ways of leading the republic economy out of 
the crisis. 
  This interview continues a series of IZVESTIYA 
TATARSTANA materials on the subject that is extremely important 
for Tatarstan's future. 
  [Fazullina] In your opinion, has the Tatarstan Government 
been able to make use of the situation in the republic--which 
over the past two years had been more favorable than in Russia 
as a whole--to implement economic reforms? 
  [Mukhametshin] It has been able to provide social protection 
for the population, which is important. Nevertheless, since it 
was not burdened with large payments into the Russian budget 
last year and had more favorable terms with respect to oil 
exports, it could and it should have used this situation to 
begin transformations at the same time in the economy, to create 
a favorable environment for the development of small- and 
medium-size business. Unfortunately, the government has been 
concerned not so much with new sources of budget revenue as with 
the optimum distribution of existing income, which in the 
current conditions quite logically kept shrinking. 
  At the latest session, the budget was subjected to just 
criticism. The analysis of parts of its revenues and 
expenditures shows that the government has a conservative 
approach to the economy. 
  [Fazullina] In this case, will Tatarstan be able--without 
its 
own economic program and still traditionally increasing the tax 
pressure on insolvent enterprises and citizens who are certainly 
not getting richer--to collect the expected budget revenue, 
especially considering that the Republic of Tatarstan's Supreme 
Soviet decreased the revenue part at the 19th session? 
  [Mukhametshin] The parliament approved the budget on 
condition that the government will develop within a month a 
program of anticrisis measures. Considering that at this point 
only R400 million rubles had been received into the budget, can 
we really expect that R3 trillion will be collected by the end 
of the year? Hardly. Therefore, today the main task for the 
government is to identify priority sectors and enterprises, 
which will be given tax preferences; develop an effective credit 
policy and a program of reduction of mutual nonpayments--today 
they have reached R2 trillion--coordinated with the federation 
government. 
  [Fazullina] If these tasks have not been resolved in two 
years, where is the guarantee that the Cabinet of Ministers will 
find a way out of the crisis situation in one month? 
  [Mukhametshin] We believe that a month is enough. A program 
of anticrisis measures will be designed to utilize both the 
republic's internal reserves--which undoubtedly exist--and the 
external ones. Many enterprises today have programs ready, and 
some of them already are being implemented. They only need 
support, and by the end of the year they will be able to 
stabilize their financial situation. It is necessary to put into 
effect the law "On Bankruptcy," and get the antitrust committee 
to work. 
  Being in the same economic space as Russia, we are also 
looking at the second part of this program--conducting a 
coordinated policy with the federal authorities, opening 
centralized credit lines for the agro-industrial complex, 
financing federal programs, and so on. The treaty we signed with 
the Russian Government allows the National Bank of Tatarstan to 
keep flexible interest rates, and we will use this ability as 
well. 
  We have to keep in mind, however, that Russia has the same 
problem as we do. We intend to participate most actively in 
joint actions, in the development of federal programs. It is 
possible that the government will bring in outside economists to 
work on the economic development of Tatarstan; we are already in 
the process of negotiations. It is too early, however, to 
mention any names. 
  [Fazullina] There were no hints at the session at having 
your 
own regional policy. Moreover, the prime minister said that 
Tatarstan will follow the line of Russian policy... 
  [Mukhametshin] A completely independent economic policy is 
hardly possible today. We cannot say, however, that Tatarstan 
will simply go with the flow of the Russian reforms. Specific 
features will definitely be taken into account, and relevant 
adjustments made. 
  [Fazullina] In your opinion, is Tatarstan in a state of 
government crisis? Do you not believe that the Cabinet of 
Ministers should resign, making room for reformers? 
  [Mukhametshin] It is too early to speak of the government's 
resignation. Everything will depend on the program they propose 
take the republic out of economic crisis. 
  [Fazullina] Have the arguments or debates on the subject of 
the budget at the latest session been natural, or is it a 
manifestation of disagreements between the parliament and the 
government? 
  [Mukhametshin] The budget is always lobbied by certain 
groups--industry, agriculture, the budget-financed sphere. 
Adopting it is working out a compromise. In the course of budget 
discussions, I did not detect a desire on the part of deputies 
to raise the issue of replacing some members of the government 
or the entire cabinet. Although in some remarks its ability to 
implement radical transformation was indeed questioned. 
  [Fazullina] Do you not believe that over the past two years 
Tatarstan's leadership has been more concerned with resolving 
political issues--both external and internal--than the problems 
of working out economic strategy? Both targeted social 
protection and support for the agro-industrial complex represent 
to a great extent programs of survival, softening the shock. Do 
they have a future or will it be necessary to fold them? 
  [Mukhametshin] Yes, a lot of money has gone into preserving 
stability in the republic. We believed that this was necessary; 
otherwise the population would have rejected reforms. Now a new 
stage has began, and we have to protect the rights we have been 
granted and prove the vitality of sovereignty. After the signing 
of a treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of 
Tatarstan, the responsibility for reforms rests solely with 
local the leadership.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Korneyeva: "Republic's First Mortgage </F>
Bank Established"] 
  [Text] The Government of Tatarstan has approved 
documents on the establishment of the republic's first mortgage 
bank. It will issue long-term credits for the construction of 
objects of civic and industrial significance. The main 
application of the mortgage is supposed to be in housing 
construction. 
  Market relations are bringing back long-forgotten concepts 
and phenomena to the housing sphere. The mortgage--or the 
issuance of credit secured by real estate--is one of them. 
Although a mortgage law has not been passed yet, a legal basis 
has been established for introduction of the mortgage in the 
form of laws on security and privatization of housing. An 
effective way of resolving the housing problem that is used in 
the whole civilized world will appear among the residents of 
Tatarstan immediately after it shows up among Muscovites and St. 
Petersburgers. 
  The founders of the mortgage bank are the Tatsotsbank, the 
housing investment building corporation Housing Initiative, and 
the Kazzhilgrazhdanstroy Association. 
  According to specialists of the corporation, any potential 
investor, after drawing up a mortgage for his old apartment or 
other real estate, can acquire credit for the construction of 
new housing with the best consumer qualities. Credit will be 
issued to the extent of 70 percent of the cost of the mortgage. 
  Although the system of mortgage credit assumes it will be 
long-term, under conditions of high inflation such possibilities 
are limited. Therefore at first, until the ruble is stabilized, 
mortgage credit will be issued for a year and a half or two 
years. Nevertheless, this will make it possible for a family 
with even an average level of income to finance the building of 
new housing. 
  It is assumed that the Housing Initiative Corporation will 
take on all the work in drawing up the documents for the 
planning and construction of the new housing and the sale of the 
old at market prices. Its aim is to create a closed building 
cycle, performing the role of a general investor. 
  The issuance of credits under mortgage on real estate is the 
main but not the only type of activity of the mortgage bank. It 
will also engage in the issuance of securities--housing 
certificates. This system is a form of shared participation of 
citizens in housing construction. Of course, given the existing 
high prices, a majority of the people do not have the necessary 
sums to purchase an apartment. Housing certificates, which 
record the right of purchasers to an appropriate share of 
housing being built, will make it possible to buy apartments in 
parts--in installments. However, it may turn out that many 
people will not be able to acquire a certificate even for a 
square meter of housing. This is taken into account, and the 
minimum share for which a security can be bought has been 
established on the scale of 0.1 square meters. 
  When a family is able to accumulate a sufficient number of 
certificates for a whole apartment, a certificate of ownership 
will be drawn up for the family. Moreover, the purchaser of 
certificates knows beforehand the address of the home being 
built. If it is impossible to purchase a packet of certificates 
for the period of its construction, the right to continue to 
accumulate them is automatically carried over to the next home 
being built. It is not only well-to-do citizens who will be able 
to solve the housing question with the help of the system of 
housing certificates, but also people of modest incomes and 
those who are unable to get credit because of a lack of real 
estate. 
  Sites under new housing construction will be offered to the 
general investor. Appropriate structures under the head of 
administration of Kazan have prepared proposals for the 
allotment of sites to the Housing Initiative Corporation. 
  The bank will set itself up in one a reconstructed building, 
which was presented in the form of its share of investment to 
the authorized capital of the bank by Kazzhilgrazhdanstroy--one 
of its founders. 
  It is assumed that the opening of the mortgage bank will 
occur in the near future, after all the documents are 
coordinated and approved in Moscow.

<F P=106> [Report by Prime Minister of Kabardino-Balkaria G.M. </F>
Cherkesov to republic assembly of representatives of Balkar 
society on 23 March 1994: "Unity of the Republic, Interethnic 
Accord, and Creative Labor Are the Foundation of the Renewal and 
Development of the Balkar People"] 
  [Text] Esteemed Comrades! 
  Literally two weeks have passed from that moment when, with 
the participation of representatives of the regions, we marked a 
sorrowful date in our republic--the 50th anniversary of the 
violent expulsion of the Balkar people. A lot was said about 
this barbarous action and its consequences at meetings, rallies, 
reports, and speeches, and in the mass media. Recalling the 
past, thinking about the fate of their much-suffering people, 
about their present and future, and seeing the faces that know 
hard times so well, the representatives spoke with special 
warmth, frequently with tears in their eyes, about what helped 
them to endure, survive, and overcome all the difficulties and 
adversities, about the friendship and fraternity of the people, 
and about the need to strengthen unity and affirm an atmosphere 
of mutual understanding, trust, and benevolence. 
  In fact, there was a detailed analysis in those days of the 
half-century path of the Balkar people, lessons were drawn from 
history, losses, successes and achievements and existing 
problems were shown, and the work being done for their 
rehabilitation was elaborated in detail. The participants in the 
mournful measures, the Balkar population and residents of the 
republic, accepted with great satisfaction the appeal of the 
edict of President of the Russian Federation Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin and the edict of President of Kabardino-Balkaria Valeriy 
Mukhamedovich Kokov directed at restoring historical justice and 
eliminating the consequences of the criminal deportation. The 
apology given to the Balkar people by the head of the Russian 
state for the arbitrariness and lawlessness committed against 
them made a great impression on everyone. 
  Thus, pressing problems are being resolved logically, and 
questions that disturb the people are being removed one by one. 
A significant step has been taken toward meeting the 
expectations of the people, and good possibilities have been 
opened up for their revival and development. 
  It would seem that everything is moving along normally and 
that there is no reason for anxiety. Nevertheless we are 
compelled today, putting aside important matters, to meet here 
together in order to look into the situation that is developing 
and discuss a number of extremely serious questions that are 
truly fateful for our people. 
  You know that the mass media recently carried speeches and 
statements by O.Y. Beppayev, acting chairman of the National 
Council of the Balkar people, that flabbergasted and discouraged 
the residents of the republic and created tension and alarm. You 
read these pearls, and you are amazed. It simply cannot be 
believed that they came from a military person who occupied 
rather high posts in the army, who has seen hatred, malice, 
blood, tears, and death, and who knows the price of rash, 
impulsive words and actions. It is offensive and bitter that 
such views and approaches are professed by a person of whom all 
of us were proud, whom we so warmly received in the republic, 
and whom we respected precisely for his dedication to the ideas 
of peace, friendship, and harmony. 
  But just what did happen? What is the reason for the 
metamorphosis that occurred? This can only be guessed. Well, in 
the meantime we must state with regret that Beppayev's 
utterances exude a peremptoriness, unsubstantiation, boundless 
ambition, and irresponsibility. These revelations, if they can 
be called such, have one purpose--to undermine trust in the 
authority structures, inflame unhealthy passions, and 
destabilize the situation. I am confident that nothing is likely 
to result from this. 
  However, let us analyze everything without haste and in an 
orderly manner. Some members of the National Council frequently 
like to present themselves as the only spokesmen of the 
interests of the Balkar people and their genuine supporters and 
benefactors. In addition, continuous attempts are made to 
confuse the issue, to convince the uninitiated that the state 
organs are idle and sit with their hands folded, but they do not 
sleep for many nights and are working to the limit of their 
strength. 
  In this connection I consider it necessary to inform you 
once 
more how the work on rehabilitation is proceeding, what has 
already been done, and what remains to be done. I want to 
emphasize especially that since the very first days the law of 
the Russian Federation was published on this question, all the 
difficult problems associated with its implementation have been 
consistently at the center of daily attention of the president 
and the government. Believe me, nothing is done that simply. 
Each step, every item in one or another adopted document 
requires a lot of strength, nerves, and time. Of course, no one 
thinks about this. It is impossible not to talk about the fact 
that on all questions of rehabilitation the Balkar people are 
moving ahead of all repressed people. And this is the great 
service performed by V.M. Kokov. He displays unusual stability 
and persistence, and uses all his influence and authority to 
resolve the indicated problems. Thank you for this, Valeriy 
Mukhamedovich! 
  One of the key directions of the activity of the government 
for rehabilitation of the Balkar people is work to overcome the 
socioeconomic backwardness of the mountain population centers 
and economies and the creation of the necessary conditions for 
their normal development. With this aim, at the initiative of 
the Cabinet of Ministers of the KBR [Kabardino-Balkar Republic], 
the Government of the Russian Federation adopted a directive on 
6 August 1991 outlining a complex of measures to expand housing 
and sociocultural construction and strengthen the 
material-technical base of the agrarian sector. 
  I do not want to tire you with figures and facts, especially 
since we have written and talked about this more than once. 
Nevertheless, some of them should be cited. To implement the 
program developed for 1991, 10.2 million rubles [R] were 
allocated, for 1992--R199 million. The question arises: Where 
did this money go specifically? I reply. For the construction of 
a club in the village of Babugent, the reconstruction of a 
children's sports school in the village of Kendelen, a 
kindergarten, a boiler house, and a sewage treatment plant in 
the village of Verkhnyaya Balkaria, gas installation and the 
development of projects for the supply of gas to the settlements 
of Kendelen, Bylym, Zhankhoteko, and Verkhnyaya Zhemtala. Owing 
to those resources, construction of housing was also conducted 
in the village of Khasanya, the village of Verkhnyaya Zhemtala, 
an out-patient clinic in the village of Gerpegezh, a hospital 
and a kindergarten in the village of Verkhnyaya Balkaria, and a 
gas supply network and roads for kolkhozes and sovkhozes. 
  More than R1.5 million in appropriations was allocated from 
the budget of the Russian Federation last year to finance 
programs for the development of mountainous population centers 
and socioeconomic support of the Balkar people. The resources in 
question were directed at strengthening the material-technical 
base of facilities in public education, health services, and 
cultural, municipal, and housing construction. 
  If anyone is interested, it is also possible to give 
specific 
addresses, but such a listing will take a lot of time. I will 
say only that some of these resources went to the creation of 
the feature film "Journey to the Edge of Life," which recounts 
the bitter years of banishment of the Balkar people, the "Book 
of Recollections," the preparation of a Balkar encyclopedia, the 
construction of mosques in the settlements of Bylym, Khasanya, 
and Babugent, and memorials to the victims of genocide and those 
who died in wars. 
  In the first quarter of 1994, R820 million was received to 
pay off credit indebtedness for the past year on construction 
projects in the mountainous population centers. These resources 
were earmarked for the construction of hospitals and clubs in 
the village of Khasanya, a sports complex in the village of 
Kendelen, the acquisition of mill equipment and a bakery in the 
village of Kich-malka, a relay station in the village of 
Khushto-Syrt, a fruit storage facility in Yanikoy, and the 
reconstruction of the Kashkhatau cannery. 
  If we are talking about the outlook, according to the Decree 
of the Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation 
"On Socioeconomic Support of the Balkar People," there are plans 
for the erection of a large number of installations of 
production and sociocultural significance. For these purposes it 
is planned to construct a Kashkhatau brick plant, expand 
enterprises of the Elbrusstroy building industry combine, the 
marshalling yard in the village of Babugent, the lime shop and 
red lead shop in the village of Khabaz, a number of shops for 
the output of small wall blocks, untreated tile, and joiners' 
articles. 
  Special attention is being given to ensure the employment of 
the able-bodied population and the creation of additional jobs. 
It is planned to build a plant for the production of consumer 
commodities in the village of Kendelen, folk art enterprises in 
Kashkhatau, Kendelen, Bezengi, Khabaz, and Khushto-Syrt. It is 
proposed to start development of mining of mineral 
deposits--bentonite, hot springs, and gold. It is planned to 
restore the settlements of Guba-santy, Ozen, Glashevo, Uskhur, 
Chelmas, Kyzgen, and others. 
  Social rehabilitation has exceptionally important 
significance in the complex of measures for restoration of 
justice. Serious work has also been done on this area. Pensions 
from 1 March 1991 have been recalculated for all who went 
through the tragedy of the forced expulsion. In fixing pensions 
for citizens who were subjected to repression, the time they 
spent in special settlements (places of exile) is tripled. An 
increase has also been implemented in the scale of pensions for 
age for each year of work, taking into account periods 
stipulated in the Law of the RSFSR "On State Pensions in the 
RSFSR." 
  There is also progress in cultural rehabilitation. At 
present 
two Balkar professional state artistic collectives are operating 
in the republic: the Dramatic Theater imeni Kaysyn Kuliyev and 
the folklore-ethnographic ensemble Balkaria. The mastery of 
these collectives is growing from year to year. They make us 
happy, give us true esthetic pleasure, and have gained 
popularity and love and recognition not only in 
Kabardino-Balkaria but also far beyond its borders. 
  A Balkar theatrical studio has been opened in the North 
Caucasus Institute of Arts to train artistic personnel. Children 
desiring to learn the art of the national dance have the 
opportunity to visit the studio while the ensemble Balkaria is 
there. All told, about 400 persons of the Balkar nationality are 
studying in training institutions of culture in the 
Kabardino-Balkar Republic. Music schools are operating in the 
settlement of Kashkhatau, the villages of Babugent, Verkhnyaya 
Balkaria, Kendelen, and Yanikoy. 
  Measures are also being taken to satisfy the requests of the 
Balkar population for press products. The republic newspaper 
ZAMAN and the journals MINGI-TAU and NYUR are now being 
published here. Pages in the Balkar language are issued 
periodically in the newspaper SOVETSKAYA MOLODEZH and in the 
city and rayon newspapers GORNYATSKAYA SLAVA, GOLOS CHEGEMA, and 
TRUDOVAYA SLAVA. The total circulation of books published in the 
Balkar language in 1993 was about 60,000 copies. The proportion 
of these publications in the republic according to titles today 
is 32 percent, and in volume, 28 percent. The quality of 
programs of television and radio broadcasting in the Balkar 
language has improved and the number of hours increased. 
  A powerful impetus is given to all this work by the Edict of 
President of the Russian Federation B.N. Yeltsin "On Measures 
for Rehabilitation of the Balkar People and State Support for 
Their Revival and Development." This document obligates the 
appropriate organs in the near future to adopt a complex of 
additional measures for the political, social, and spiritual 
revival of the Balkar people. It addresses the problems and 
return to the motherland of our countrymen from Central Asia and 
Kazakhstan, grants persons from among repressed peoples new 
benefits in pension support, and allocates resources for a 
lump-sum allowance to persons of Balkar nationality who were 
subjected to illegal resettlement and their families, including 
children who were born in special settlement places. 
Incidentally, this question is being examined in the Ministry of 
Finance of Russia, and we hope that it will be decided 
favorably. As for the R1 billion coming from the budget of the 
Russian Federation for these purposes, the Cabinet of Ministers 
of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic authorized the Ministry of 
Social Protection of the Population in a month's time to pay out 
a lump-sum allowance of R500,000 each to rehabilitated persons 
of Balkar nationality over 80 years of age, and also to 
participants in the Great Patriotic War, regardless of age. 
  The edict of President of the Kabardino-Balkaria Republic 
V.M. Kokov of 8 March 1994 is truly historic. Its great 
significance is determined by the fact that this document, if it 
is supported by our parliament, will perhaps resolve the most 
severe problems that have been the subject of speculation for a 
long time. It addresses the renaming of Sovetskiy Rayon to 
Cherkesskiy Rayon, the restoration of Elbrusskiy Rayon, and the 
creation of a bicameral parliament, one of whose chambers would 
be formed on a parity basis. We are convinced that the 
implementation of this edict will not encroach on anyone's 
interests and rights and that it will not harm anyone. As V.M. 
Kokov emphasized at a recent news conference, it is dictated by 
the aspirations to put an end to confrontation, to cut the 
ground from under all kinds of extremists, and to ensure peace 
and accord in our republic. 
  As we see, a lot is being done to restore justice. I will 
say 
more: A unique opportunity exists at present for genuine revival 
and development of the Balkar people. It must be taken advantage 
of. Peace-loving and kind by nature, they are interested in 
civic peace, stability, and tranquility in the republic, and in 
creative labor. However, judging by some publications, this does 
not please individual figures. They need discord, intrigues, 
rallies, and congresses in order to remain afloat and be visible. 
  How else can one explain the harsh and deliberately 
confrontational speeches of S.U. Beppayev. Is it really not 
blasphemous to call the mournful rally near the railroad station 
square and the meeting of the public "a shameful spectacle" and 
"a stagnant party aktiv." On what grounds does the general 
declare that he is supported by almost all the Balkar people? 
Who empowered him to speak in their behalf, who gave him the 
right to try to raise doubts about the legitimacy of the leaders 
of the republic. It is rather paradoxical that a person who has 
lived for just a short time in Kabardino-Balkaria allows himself 
to make such statements. 
  Indeed, it will become known to the general that the peoples 
of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic, including the Balkar people, 
voted for the Constitution of the Russian Federation, and voted 
rather energetically for the election of the president and the 
prime minister of the republic to the Federal Assembly. This 
means that the Balkar people trust the leadership of the 
republic, approve and support its program of actions, and share 
its position and views on fundamental questions. 
  Esteemed Comrades! 
  Today the leaders of rayons, cities, villages, and 
settlements, deputies, members of the government, the scientific 
and artistic intelligentsia, in other words the pick of the 
nation, have assembled in this hall. We are the sons and 
daughters of our long-suffering Balkar people. And to us, of 
course, its fate is not a matter of indifference. If this is so, 
we cannot today pretend that nothing is happening, remain 
silent, and live according to the principle "it is no concern of 
mine," or "we will see what will come out of this." 
  To our great regret, some of our comrades, people who work 
in 
responsible posts, are not showing themselves to be fighters, 
they are passive, they temporize, they want to be good for 
everyone. This unquestionably does not become them. The writers, 
poets, artists, painters, and scientists have not made their 
weighty utterances yet. We must put the question today in a 
tough way--it is time to take a position and to find in yourself 
the courage to talk about this frankly. You cannot sit immorally 
on two chairs. 
  After all, we are not talking about something petty and 
personal. We are talking about reputation, honor, dignity, about 
destiny, specifically about the fate of the people. This is the 
question: Either they will follow the path of peace, accord, 
creativity, cooperation, and progress, or they will be doomed to 
new suffering and deprivation. 
  Is it really not clear to us that hotheads and figures who 
are inclined to be extremists have an excessive desire to 
destroy that which was created over many decades and centuries, 
that they want to reduce to naught the tangible results achieved 
in recent years through joint efforts in the rehabilitation and 
creation of pleasant conditions for the socioeconomic and 
cultural development of the Balkar people? Is it really possible 
to look at all of this calmly? Is it really permissible to 
remain silent and, what is more, to assent to it? 
  No, we must, we are bound to give a decisive rebuff to those 
(and it is a small group of people) who are pushing the people 
to the abyss, those who in their unseemly affairs are trying to 
hide behind their name. Our duty is to explain to the people, 
especially to the youth, who is who, who is trying to do what, 
and to what the aggressive speeches, vanity, and excessive 
ambition of individual politicians may lead. We have to do 
everything to ensure that people believe us and follow us, not 
those who are excessively suspicious, offended, woolgathering, 
and irresponsible leaders--impostors. 
  There is no need to talk about what difficult times our 
country is experiencing now. And, alas, it seems there is no ray 
of hope. This year also promises us little. It is already 
becoming clearer and clearer to a large number of both 
politicians and ordinary citizens that confrontation, 
opposition, scandals, and fighting are ruinous, and that they 
threaten the existence of the state itself. The only salvation 
is to strengthen legality and law and order. 
  This truth is urgent in an even greater degree for our 
country. We can no longer in any way spend precious time, 
forces, and energy on explaining relations and on fruitless 
discussions and arguments. It is necessary for all of us now to 
work on the economy. How to stop the decrease in standard of 
living of the population and the reduction in production, how to 
achieve the stable operation of enterprises of all forms of 
ownership, kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and individual farms, what must 
be done so that people have jobs and receive wages on time, so 
that they can walk the streets without fear, teach and rear 
their children in peace, and look to tomorrow without fear--this 
is what we have to think about, it is toward this that the 
efforts of state organs and public associations, and all of us 
together, should be directed. Only together will we be able to 
resolve these problems. No one will be able to pull out of the 
crisis, out of the poverty and need, by acting alone. This 
really is what the experience of the republics of the former 
USSR, now sovereign states, and the sad fate of even such giants 
as Ukraine tells us. 
  We have outlined great plans, including on the development 
of 
mountainous population centers, mountain farms, and full 
rehabilitation of the Balkar people. We are fully resolved to 
bring this work to its logical conclusion. Let no one hinder us. 
  The majority of the Balkar people always was and is for the 
integrity of the republic. Separatist slogans and appeals are 
foreign to it. The people associate their present and future, 
their dreams and hopes, their successes and achievements with 
their own united and indivisible Kabardino-Balkaria, with 
friendship and fraternity with Kabardin, Russian, and other 
peoples who live in the republic. They realize deeply that the 
unity of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic, interethnic accord, and 
creative labor are the basis and indispensable condition for 
revival, development, and prosperity. No one will be able to 
deceive the Balkar people, confuse them, or force them to change 
the traditions and precepts of their forefathers. 
  I thank you for your attention.

<F P=106> ["Statement of the Communist Party of the Kabardino-Balkar </F>
Republic Executive Committee"] 
  [Text] Dear Comrades! 
  The appeal of the republic assembly of representatives of 
the 
Balkar community to the peoples, political parties, and public 
associations was perceived by the Communist Party of the 
republic with approval. 
  The communists of Kabardino-Balkaria consistently advocate 
with all patriots and internationalists the integrity and unity 
of the republic within the indivisible Russian Federation. The 
centuries-old friendship and fraternal unity of the Kabarda, 
Balkars, Russians, and all other peoples of our republic is the 
most valuable property of all that was bequeathed us by our 
forefathers. These relations helped us endure in the years of 
the wartime adversities, famine, and repression. Only by 
preserving them will we overcome the present serious situation 
also. The communists support the efforts of the president, 
parliament, the government, and all parties and national 
movements aimed at preservation of the unity of the 
Kabardino-Balkar Republic. 
  We condemn the irresponsible statements of individual 
leaders 
of the National Council of the Balkar People concerning the 
division of Kabardino-Balkaria and regard them as an attempt to 
destabilize the peaceful situation and to incite interethnic 
strife in the republic. 
  The Communist Party of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic 
Executive Committee calls on the working people, communists, 
parties, and movements to make every effort to preserve the 
unity of Kabardino-Balkaria and peace and tranquillity in our 
native home. 
  [Signed] Communist Party of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic 
Executive Committee.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Eduard Gazizovich Umarov, chairman </F>
of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic Organization of the 
Consolidation Party; place and date not given: "Consolidation? 
So, Then, We Can Breathe Easy..."] 
  [Text] "You would like to see our republic wealthy, 
attractive, prosperous? You would be pleased to see the 
appearance of a whole network of new enterprises and hundreds 
and thousands of extra jobs? You would take pride in seeing 
shops treating wool and garment factories operating in stable 
fashion? The burgeoning of mining industry in our abundant 
region with its priceless minerals? High-quality machine tools 
not hacking up but cutting the Khabaz and Bezengi stone 
according to specifications? And there is hardly a fellow 
countryman who would not want to turn the Elbrus region into a 
second Switzerland, if not better. The currency resources of 
foreigners involved in business, whom we are not as yet "luring" 
to the center of our beauties to the republic's benefit, would 
help here.... 
  "And if you want all this, if you are interested in people's 
relations being not on a national and political basis but 
according to professional attributes, with a keen desire for 
property, peace, and prosperity, come to us!" 
  This was the conclusion of the sincere and ardent 
introduction to an interview with Eduard Gazizovich Umarov, 
chairman of a new party registered by the Kabardino-Balkar 
Republic Ministry of Justice on 3 February 1994. It is called 
the Kabardino-Balkar Republic Organization of the Consolidation 
Party. 
  Here are some extracts from its rules: "The KBRO 
[Kabardino-Balkar Republic Organization] of the Consolidation 
Party is a political organization voluntarily uniting in its 
ranks citizens of the Russian Federation who are permanent 
residents on the territory of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic and 
who recognize the program and rules of the party and also the 
rules of the KBRO of the party.... 
  ...The main goals... are: 
  the revival of Russia as a distinctive, historically 
unique state and of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic as a component 
of the Russian Federation uniting in peace and harmony people of 
different nationalities, religious beliefs, and professional, 
social, and property position on the principles of democratism, 
civic unity, patriotism, equal opportunities, the priority of 
the highest value--human dignity--and responsibility for the 
country and the fate of future generations. 
  To achieve the said goals... it will participate in 
elections to the representative organs of power and local 
government, with its own slate of candidates for deputy 
included, take part in the established procedure in the 
formation of the organs of state power and administration and 
also local government, and exercise legislative initiative; 
  appear in the news media and the party press.... 
  maintain direct contacts and relations among public and 
political organizations of other components of the Russian 
Federation.... 
  create research, analytical, and sociological centers 
for the study of public opinion, the needs and requirements of 
the citizens...." 
  The rules say also that a citizen of Russia who has attained 
to the age of 18 and who recognizes the rules of the KBRO of the 
party, who renders it support, and who is a permanent resident 
on the territory of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic may be a 
member of the KBRO of the Consolidation Party. 
  Party members do not pay dues. The monetary resources and 
other assets of the KBRO of the party, the rules say, shall be 
formed thanks to the voluntary contributions of organizations 
and citizens and income from its own industrial-economic and 
publishing activity and also from other receipts authorized by 
legislation. 
  At an organizational session of the new party (its action 
committee was made up of about 30 persons) those who spoke noted 
the vital nature of the party's base principles. They said that 
its program would determine the prospects of the socioeconomic 
development of the country and, consequently, of our republic 
also. 
  Of course, I immediately inquired after the sources of the 
event, how and in what connection the party chairman had 
conceived of its creation in Kabardino-Balkaria, and what 
altogether the Consolidation Party of Russia represents. 
  Instead of answering, Eduard Gazizovich showed me the 
journal 
DELOVYYE LYUDI with a striking, well-designed cover. It 
contained a portrait of Aleksandr Tikhonov, the prominent 
Russian entrepreneur and general director of the Interural 
Enterprise. He has been chairman of the Consolidation Party of 
Russia since October 1992, apparently. 
  "An entrepreneur in politics?" I expressed surprise. 
  Here my interlocutor smiled silently. He then showed me a 
page of the newspaper KURANTY: 
  "A journalist put to the person himself, Tikhonov, the same 
question...." 
  Much did, indeed, become clear from a reading of Aleksandr 
Anatolyevich's interview with a KURANTY correspondent. 
  The Interural Enterprise is a multiprofile enterprise and it 
has been involved in the production and exports of metal 
products, the development and assimilation of new technology, 
wood processing, and the production of building materials and 
consumer goods. It is apparent that business has been oriented 
toward the realization of social programs. Modern installations 
for the packing of meat and equipment for the production of 
sanitary engineering apparatus have been purchased, clothing is 
made up, and nails and cement are manufactured. In Nizhniy 
Tagil, where mountains of slag had grown up, its conversion was 
organized together with German and Swiss firms. But... 
enterprise has become increasingly difficult. The preposterous 
taxes are unsettling people. It was then that the idea of 
becoming involved in politics, which formulate the rules of the 
game, began to mature. After all, it can be seen more clearly 
"from inside" what kind of laws should emanate from the state so 
that those who are responsible for the economy might breathe 
more freely. It should dictate the rules to the politicians, not 
the other way about. Tikhonov believes that it is very important 
to create in Russia a procedure which would encourage 
production, not throw wrenches in its works. And I am sure that 
the activity of a highly skilled, honest entrepreneur might even 
lead to some amendment in the law which would improve the work 
of the enterprise and the ordinary worker. 
  For this reason he created a party, as he said, with a 
unifying principle--creation is possible only in a stable 
society. I do not understand, Tikhonov said, the politicians--of 
both right and left--who are exacerbating the situation in the 
country! 
  The Consolidation Party advocates a diversity of forms of 
property and a multistructured rural economy and everything 
being done intelligently. At the end of the interview the 
chairman of the Consolidation Party of Russia shared with the 
KURANTY correspondent recollections of how he, as an 
entrepreneur, had frequently traveled abroad. And had seen the 
following picture: In one room the politicians of two countries 
were negotiating, in another, businessmen from both sides. And 
before the adoption of a political decision, the first would 
inquire of the second: We have now considered questions with a 
bearing on such-and-such economic problems; what is best here? 
And the latter would make suggestions.... 
  "Eduard Gazizovich," I tore myself away from the newspaper 
article, "the idea that the most adept politicians could emerge 
from the ranks of entrepreneurs is clear to everyone. But let us 
return to our party. How might Aleksandr Anatolyevich Tikhonov 
help it, a branch of the Russian party, initially?" 
  "Everything will depend primarily on us, on an expansion of 
the circle of business people wishing to join the party. Not 
simultaneously and not all at once but certain heights may be 
scaled and ties to overseas firms established. We need to create 
an original economic basis. To strengthen our intermediary role 
in the organization of foreign tourism via Interural, say. 
  "Foreigners involved in business would be told that people 
are not fighting each other here. They would prepare tourist 
packages for us, we would drive them around here and offer 
billionaires family recreation in the mountains of the Elbrus 
region and at the Goluboye lakes and Chegem waterfalls. We 
would, crudely speaking, force out foreign currency, which we 
would immediately allocate for social needs. Tikhonov has 
connections with the countries that have the most modern 
drilling equipment, rock drills (Italy, Germany), Swedish 
cars.... Of course, they will not invest a kopek for us in this 
work unless there are dependable guarantees from the center. Our 
membership of the Consolidation Party of Russia, which many of 
the world's businessmen recognize, could be this distinctive 
guarantee.... 
  "Of course, in order to put things on as broad a footing as 
possible, all of Russian power, we need to increase the number 
of party members, explain to people the meaning of its work...." 
  "Eduard Gazizovich, you are known and respected in the 
republic as an experienced, professional worker in the public 
utilities sphere. If you have resolved to put your economic 
knowledge at the service of policy, prosperity, and 
consolidation, I would like to wish you well and wish you 
success. Our newspaper always supports peaceful, profoundly 
considered initiatives. And we will, most likely, meet several 
times more for a discussion on this theme." 
  "I am sure of it. Only let people respond, may they wish to 
realize our ideas together with us. My office number is 9-77-64.

<F P=106> [Account of report of B.K. Shukhostanov, minister of </F>
industry of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria; place and date 
not given: "Industrial Upturn--Not Only an Economic but Also a 
Social Problem"] 
  [Text] As already reported in our paper, there has been a 
meeting of leaders of the republic's industrial enterprises. A 
report on the results of work in 1993 and the tasks to stabilize 
the situation in the present year was delivered by B.K. 
Shukhostanov, minister of industry of the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria. 
  He observed that the situation in the republic's industry 
was 
characterized by the continued decline in production, a 
reduction in investment activity, the low solvency of the 
enterprises, and difficulties in the sale of the finished 
product. 
  At the same time an analysis shows that the first signs of 
an 
easing of the crisis situation appeared in the latter half, 
although the situation has not been stabilized completely. 
  Despite the fact that in the mechanical engineering complex 
production constituted 96.7 percent of the 1992 level, far from 
all enterprises operated at the proper level, and 12 out of the 
21 showed a decline in production of more than 10 percent. Some 
managers reduced their size considerably, not appreciably 
increasing wages or running up enormous bank credit debts here. 
These included the Sevkavrentgen, Terekalmaz, the Prokhladnyy 
Maintenance Plant, the SKEP, Nalchik Telemechanical Apparatus 
Plant, NZPP, PZPP, and others. 
  A characteristic feature of the decline in production in 
this 
sector was the reduction in the manufacture of high-technology 
and intricate products. Thus the production of instruments and 
means of automation declined 37.9 percent, of medical equipment, 
28.5 percent, high-voltage apparatus, 19.8 percent, and 
electronic equipment products, 54.1 percent. 
  Particular difficulties were experienced by conversion 
enterprises of the defense sectors, of which there are six on 
the territory of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, which 
employ more than 10,000 persons. Conversion programs of 
modernization and retooling and renewal of the product list 
approved in the appropriate departments and committees of the 
Russian Federation and included in the Federal Conversion 
Program have been devised for them. Realization of the latter 
will make it possible thanks to a change in the production 
structure to create capacity for the manufacture of civilian 
products and consumer goods worth R5 billion a year in prices of 
the first quarter of 1993 and to preserve jobs. 
  But under the conditions of the strict financial and 
resource 
limitations the conversion programs are not in practice being 
funded and are not being fulfilled. The task of the current year 
is to ensure the allocation of credit resources in full and to 
reorient these enterprises toward the civilian sector of the 
economy at an accelerated pace. 
  No less disquiet is being aroused by the iron and steel 
sector, which constitutes 19.7 percent of the republic's total 
industrial production, and the results of the work of the TVMK 
are directly reflected in the living conditions and living 
standard of the population of Tyrnyauz. The main problem for the 
TVMK and GMZ in the year under review remained the limited 
nature of the sale of output on account of the high prices, 
which exceed domestic and world prices by 25-30 percent, the 
insolvency of the consumers, and the unchecked growth of the 
price of energy. As a result the works' indebtedness to 
suppliers, the treasury, and the banks constituted R10.516 
billion, of which for electric power, R7.119 billion. 
  The president and the government of the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria are constantly rendering the utmost support 
in the solution of the problems that confront the metallurgical 
sector. Thanks to this, the question of the depositing in the 
state reserves of the Russian Federation of 750 tonnes of 
metallic tungsten was solved, which made it possible to maintain 
relatively high production in the past year. 
  Within the framework of state support for the sector it was 
decided to grant the TVMK long-term investment credit for 
modernization and the preservation of capacity totaling R1.25 
billion and to halve the tariff on energy allocated for its 
needs. The leadership of the republic found an opportunity to 
purchase and deposit in the state reserves R700 million of 
concentrate from the working capital allocated the 
Kabbalkkontrakt. 
  The situation in light industry, which perceives the 
severance of business ties with the suppliers of raw material 
from CIS countries and the sharp reduction in effective consumer 
demand the most, remains difficult. 
  The decline in production in this sector constituted 31.6 
percent. A particularly alarming situation has come about at the 
Iskozh Works, the Garment Association, the Nartkalinskiy 
Production Combine, and the Kubinskaya Footwear Factory. 
  It is essential to adopt special measures to halt the 
complete disintegration of the republic's light industry and 
find an opportunity to resolve its problems not only and not so 
much thanks to assistance from the federal authorities but by 
reliance mainly on our own powers and the use of intrinsic 
reserves and resources. 
  In conjunction with enterprises of light industry the 
ministry drew up and approved last year a program of 
intersectoral cooperation based on the Iskozh Works. It provides 
for the assimilation of new product types at eight enterprises 
of light industry, which, it is forecast, will provide 
significant economic benefits and will exclude their dependence 
on suppliers from other regions. It is essential subsequently to 
continue work in this direction with the involvement of 
enterprises of the mechanical engineering complex also. 
  There is also a need now for the elaboration and 
introduction 
of a system of a republic (Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria) 
government contract for products constituting the consumer 
basket, basic necessities, and commodities of a social focus. 
This would contribute to the filling of the market with 
affordable consumer merchandise and would stabilize industrial 
enterprises' relations with trade. Another lever, of which more 
efficient use needs to be made, is the privatization as soon as 
possible of enterprises of light industry in the form of their 
sale at public auction on a competitive basis. And use of the 
monies earned for the creation of new jobs and investments in 
programs of the structural reorganization of light industry. 
  A year ago we considered the "weakest points" the decline in 
production and the sharp reduction in investments in the 
national economy inasmuch as this was jeopardizing the 
structural reorganization of the economy and emergence from the 
crisis. But with time the accents have begun to shift. An 
analysis of the actual processes occurring in the country leads 
to the conclusion that it is not the decline in production but 
social problems, unemployment primarily, which have become 
critical today. 
  The present year could be worrying in this respect. 
According 
to preliminary estimates, more than 3,500 persons will be laid 
off. This means that it is necessary to devise a set of measures 
stimulating tax privileges for the enterprises and 
entrepreneurial structures which create new jobs and increase 
output. 
  The wages of the employees of industry of the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria remain extremely low. In December they 
constituted only R59,329 against an average in the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria as a whole of R84,200, and in the Russian 
Federation, of R141,200. 
  Ministry enterprises continued to experience serious 
financial difficulties also. True, R16.626 billion of profit 
were obtained. But the enterprises' contribution to the 
formation of the republic budget is extremely uneven. The 
largest profit was obtained by the Kavkazkabel, the Machinery 
Plant, and the Avtozapchast. Nine enterprises are unprofitable, 
and their sum total of losses constituted R294.6 million. These 
include the SKEP, Tekhnopribor, and TZNVA plants, the Kubinskaya 
Footwear Factory, and others. 
  The level of profitability remains low also. Thus with an 
annual production of R1.288 billion Telemekhanika obtained a 
profit of only R2 million. This means that the outfit did not 
form the necessary accumulation fund and did not participate in 
formation of the republic budget. 
  The shortage of enterprises' own working capital under the 
conditions of the wholesale increase in prices and the limited 
availability of credit resources has caused a most acute 
nonpayments crisis. The extent of customers' arrears past due 
for supplied products, jobs performed, and services rendered 
owed enterprises of the ministry constituted R10.463 billion. At 
the same time, on the other hand, our enterprises' accounts 
payable to suppliers constituted R14.365 billion. 
  A reason for this complication of the financial situation 
was 
the lack of requirement for individual types of products, as a 
result of which remnants thereof at warehouses constituted 
R13.862 billion. The problem in this sphere could be eased to a 
certain extent by the involvement of the Kabbalkkontrakt in the 
sale of the industrial product of enterprises of the republic. 
It is essential also to revive the functions of the former state 
wholesale depots, which undertook professionally both the 
purchase and sale of our commodities. 
  The new market structure has today become a reality. There 
are outfits that have already adapted to its conditions. Their 
managers did not wait for spectral assistance or instructions 
from above but created multiprofile production and increased the 
independence and responsibility of the structural subdivisions. 
These include the Machinery Plant, the Kavkazkabel, the 
Machine-Tool Plant, the Avtozapchast, and others. They are 
increasing production and solving questions of sales and 
nonpayments independently. 
  Many problems should be resolved by privatization. It is 
being perceived ambivalently in the republic. Because, most 
likely, we have yet to obtain the results we were entitled to 
expect. The actual progress of privatization is not exerting a 
pronounced influence on production efficiency. It is frequently 
of a formal nature and is pursued as an end in itself. The 
unjustified appropriation of state property is taking place, the 
manageability of the economy is declining, and the privatization 
process itself is being discredited. It is sufficient to say 
that at check auctions a substantial part of the shares of the 
Teleavtomatika and High-Voltage Apparatus plants ended up with 
three or four persons who had dubious sources of income and who 
had never had any connection with these outfits. 
  It should be noted that the current privatization program is 
geared to the accomplishment of a utopian idea--making all 
citizens of Russia subjects of private property with the aid of 
vouchers. Whence a whole number of negative consequences. For 
this reason it is proposed, without calling in question the need 
for privatization, to correct some of its conceptual principles. 
  In conjunction with enterprises of the republic the Ministry 
of Industry of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria also conducted 
a "stock-taking" and review of the program of structural 
reorganization of industry of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria 
with a view to concentrating resources in the priority areas. 
Today the task is to provide them with real sources of 
financing. And these may appear only with the inclusion of our 
programs in federal programs such as Conversion, Fuel and 
Energy, Equipment for the Agro-Industrial Complex, the Farmer, 
Consumer Goods, and so forth. Thirty-two projects have been 
devised altogether. 
  But the structural reorganization of the economy, an 
acceleration of scientific and technological progress, and an 
increase in enterprises' competitiveness must be organized in 
the expectation not only of government support but also on the 
basis of the active enlistment of private and joint-stock 
companies and joint ventures and their capital in the renewal of 
production. 
  The Government of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria will 
support primarily those who can step up their business activity, 
normalize their financial situation, and ensure profitable work 
under the conditions of the market. 
  There are opportunities for creating the conditions for an 
escape from the crisis in 1994. Sufficient production 
engineering, scientific, and personnel potential is preserved as 
yet. The actual timeframe and scale of realization of this 
potential, however, will largely be determined by organization 
and a capacity to tackle the tasks confronting the republic's 
industry. They consist of a halt to the general decline in 
production. Together with winding down and changing the 
production structure of nonviable works it will be necessary, 
furthermore, to stabilize the manufacture of products in demand 
and create the conditions for the revitalization and development 
of promising types of activity shaping the republic's actual 
economic potential. 
  The accomplishment of these tasks will depend to a 
considerable extent on the ability of the corps of directors to 
resolve under the present difficult conditions the problems 
confronting the work force, initiative, and an ability to get 
one's bearings under the complex conditions of the market. V.M. 
Gukepshev, director of the Nalchik Footwear Factory, called 
attention to the fact that an increase in the price of 
electricity would complicate even further the situation at the 
enterprise, which lacks working capital to purchase materials. 
Nor, as before, is their quality satisfactory either, on account 
of which our footwear cannot compete with foreign footwear and 
is not in demand. These difficulties are typical of light 
industry as a whole, and for this reason they worry M.O. 
Karmova, director of the Nalchik Leather Notions Factory, also. 
  A whole number of questions concerning the further 
development of instrument making was broached by the following 
directors: R.E. Buterus of Kavkazkabel, V.Kh. Khabitov of 
Elektronmash, V.F. Tishchenko of the NZPP, and A.Kh. Akhokhov of 
Telemekhanika. The latter also voiced a number of criticisms of 
the Ministry of Industry of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. 
The proposal of D.A. Miziyev, director of the TVMK, concerning 
the creation on the River Baksan of a hydroelectric power 
station cascade, which would resolve the problem of the 
republic's power supply, was interesting. 
  Yu.K. Altudov, chairman of the State Property Committee, 
familiarized those present with the progress of the 
privatization process here. He affirmed that only half of the 
enterprises outlined by the program had taken part in check 
auctions as yet and that the slowing of the process of 
privatization was being reflected both in the psychological 
restructuring of the work force and in investment in production. 
The far from brilliant situation on the labor market was 
portrayed by L.V. Pogrebnyak, minister of labor and employment. 
The need for an improvement in the tax and banking systems was 
described by Minister of Economics M.N. Tsikanov and V.K. 
Sokhov, vice premier of the republic. 
  The debate was concluded by V.M. Kokov, president of the 
Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. He emphasized that the period of 
political wrangling was over and that the Constitution of the 
Russian Federation had been adopted. We have all seen for 
ourselves that the people cannot be fed by slogans, and for this 
reason the purpose of our entire activity must shift in the 
direction of the economy. And the most acute problem, what is 
more, is industrial upturn. A considerable part of the 
population of the republic, producing material benefits, but 
living from pay packet to pay packet, is employed in it. 
  Unfortunately, he observed, the speeches of the corps of 
directors contained more complaints than actual proposals. 
Nonetheless, the situation cannot be considered hopeless. We 
have a Ministry of Industry, which, with the support of the 
Council of Directors, should be the coordinating body and 
intermediary in a solution of our problems in the center.... And 
great assertiveness locally should be displayed by the 
administration chiefs. They have ceased involving themselves as 
of late in questions of production, have lost contact with the 
work force, and are unaware of its problems. 
  But the main complaints were leveled at the enterprise 
managers. V.M. Kokov recalled how many demands had been heard 
concerning the need for protection against party diktat and the 
strict planning framework and for independence and freedom of 
action to be granted. Sufficient time has passed, and if some 
directors have been unable to reorganize, it is hard to expect 
this now. The government is trying to support industry. But the 
Bankruptcy Act will be applied in respect to enterprises that 
are unable to restore production in the very near future. 
  Lest they perish one by one, the way out of the critical 
situation for native enterprises could be the creation of 
industrial and financial groups, which would include those 
involved in wood processing, the creation of equipment and cable 
products for the oil workers, and so forth. This would make it 
possible for them to have their own finances and their own bank 
and, consequently, conditions for maneuver and product 
replacement, without which hoping for a production upturn is 
currently impossible. There are reserves within the republic, 
and more initiative and perseverance in their use need to be 
displayed. We have approached the critical line, V.M. Kokov 
said, but the present year must be a turning point for the 
industry of Kabardino-Balkaria.

<F P=106> [Article by Alla Barakhova: "There Are Four Contenders for </F>
the Post of President. The Election Will Cost the Taxpayers 
Three Billion Rubles"] 
  [Text] The last stage of the election campaign has begun in 
the Republic of Komi. Several days ago the Central Electoral 
Commission registered four candidates for the post of head of 
government who have received the number of votes necessary for 
registration. Aleksandr Gladkov, general director of the 
Inta-Ugol Concern; Yuriy Spiridonov, chairman of the Republic of 
Komi Supreme Soviet; Vyacheslav Khudyayev, chairman of the 
Republic of Komi Council of Ministers; and Valeriy Markov, 
chairman of the State Committee for Revival of the Komi People, 
who came out in favor of the rights of the Komi people codified 
in the law, became the contenders. All the candidates have yet 
to release the final versions of their election platforms. 
  Recently Chairman of the Council of Ministers Vyacheslav 
Khudyayev has been voicing in interviews and public 
presentations the opinion that now is not the time for the 
election; the situation in the economy is too difficult. The 3 
billion needed to elect the head of the republic and the 
deputies of local soviets will have to be taken away from 
teachers, physicians, and other employees of the sector financed 
from the budget. These statements are being received in various 
ways. Khudyayev's supporters view them as showing concern for 
the people, and his opponents--as indicating a desire to 
frustrate the elections. Incidentally, according to a public 
opinion poll, Khudyayev's rating is the lowest, with the current 
head of parliament, Yuriy Spiridonov, ranking first. 
  Vigorous actions taken by Spiridonov to defend the interests 
of the republic while serving as head of parliament are 
contributing to his success. 
  Thus, at a press conference concerning the results of a 
regular meeting of the Federation Council, Yuriy Spiridonov, 
chairman of the Republic of Komi parliament, stated that the law 
on guarantees and compensation for northern territories was not 
taken into account in development of the 1994 federal budget of 
the Russian Federation; the budgets of krays and republics are 
expected to assume a proportion of federal spending. In this 
case the entire burden of expenditures will devolve on 
enterprises. In the opinion of Yuriy Spiridonov, only radical 
changes in tax policy can improve the existing situation and 
make the output of northern enterprises competitive. Referring 
to the results of joint hearings on the north in the Federation 
Council with the State Duma, Spiridonov stated that an agreement 
among deputies from the northern regions exists under which the 
deputies intend to block passage of the budget if the draft of 
the document does not envision complying with the law on the 
north. The decision of a session of the Republic of Komi 
parliament on reducing tax transfers to the federal budget from 
13 to 8 percent will take effect on 15 April.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Yemelyanov under the rubric "Kalmykia": </F>
"Adoption of the `Code of the Steppe' Instead of the 
Constitution Did Not Shake the Republic, but It Did Rally the 
Opposition"] 
  [Text] Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was the first leader of one of 
the 16 autonomous entities within Russia to openly accommodate 
Moscow, which seemed to many after his statement on 11 March to 
be to the detriment of his own people's interest. 
  Yuli Oglayev, an associate professor of Kalmyk State 
University and the leader of the opposition, called the 
condition of society in the initial hours following 
Ilyumzhinov's statement on cancellation of the republic 
constitution one of shock: "Just as in all of Russia, our life 
before 11 March was hard but peaceful. Kirsan blew up the 
peace." The explosion resulted in the creation of a public 
Committee in Defense of the Constitution, Citizenship, and Human 
Rights, which representatives of 16 parties and movements 
joined, and the convocation by them of the Extraordinary 
Congress of the Nations of Kalmykia. 
  Communists, democrats, and nationalists united for the first 
time in order to defend the republic Constitution, which each of 
them viewed as serving their interests. 
  However, neither the congress nor the two rallies in front 
of 
the parliament building (on the first occasion 500 people 
attended, on the second--about 1,500) interfered with Kirsan 
Ilyumzhinov seeing the endeavor through to a victorious end. On 
5 April the Constitutional Assembly of Kalmykia voted almost 
unanimously in favor of the draft proposed by the president as 
recently as three weeks ago. The Code of the Steppe replaced the 
Constitution of the republic. Attempting to prove the 
illegitimacy of what had happened, representatives of the 
opposition gave examples of ways in which citizens had ended up 
as delegates to the Constitutional Assembly. They had gotten 
there in an undemocratic manner, by directives from on high. At 
present the public committee intends to contest the outcome of 
the voting which was favorable to the president in the 
Constitutional Court of Russia. 
  In Ilyumzhinov's words, introduction of the draft pursued 
several objectives: to determine the level of ethnic 
self-awareness, to figure out the groups held together by 
"anti-Kirsan sentiment," to find out the attitude of other 
republics toward anyone that "goes back" to Moscow and the 
response of Moscow itself to such, and finally, to verify how 
his own entourage "takes a punch." As the president stated, "my 
suppositions were borne out 100 percent." In the opinion of the 
president, the level of self-awareness turned out to be quite 
high. He believes that state and party officials have formed the 
previously quite languid opposition together with new leaders 
from among the professors and representatives of the Ayrat 
National Party. "Weaklings" were revealed among his 
confederates: Kirsan's former best friend, the editor of 
IZVESTIYA KALMYKII, Koneyev, came out with a protest against the 
Code of the Steppe (he was forced to quit of his own accord). 
They also replaced the leader of the republic TV and radio who, 
in the opinion of the president, was not on the ball. The poet 
David Kugultinov, whose outrage was promptly transmitted on 
ITAR-TASS channels, calmed down after a talk with Kirsan, and 
spoke with inspiration in defense of the presidential draft at 
the Constitutional Assembly. In the process, some people in the 
audience had to wipe away tears. 
  The official response of Moscow is not quite clear at this 
point. The republics have responded to the Kalmyk demarche in a 
very guarded manner, especially Tatarstan and Chechnya. 
  In the assessment of both independent analysts and those 
from 
the opposition, the Code of the Steppe perceptibly reinforces 
the power of the president, which is far from weak to begin 
with, and ordains much closer legal and economic integration 
within the framework of Russia than was previously the case. 
  Responding to a question about when Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, to 
whom the right to schedule the convocation of the Khural is 
delegated under the new main law, will do so, the president 
responded: "I have set a time for myself, but we will still 
consult the parliament." Members of the parliament for whom the 
Khural means the end of their activity in political life will 
possibly try to delay this time. However, Kirsan Nikolayevich 
intends to insist on as early as the beginning of next year. 
  For all most extensive powers of the president, the Khural 
in 
particular remains a legislative straw at which those unhappy 
with the current state of affairs may very well grasp and try to 
implement their plans to "contain" Ilyumzhinov, and if it works 
out, use a referendum for new presidential elections. In the 
opinion of experts, for now the opposition's chances are not 
good: The population of Kalmykia is more concerned with its own 
everyday problems rather than political battles on high, and 
faith in a strong leader as personified by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov 
has not ultimately been lost. 
  Does the president have something to boast of on the 
anniversary of his election and the adoption of a new law? 
According to data from the republic administration of 
statistics, a recession is being registered virtually 
everywhere. Sales on the market have fallen 30 percent; freight 
carriage by motor vehicles is down to one-half; in the villages 
they are slaughtering cattle; of 5,200 unemployed, people under 
30 account for almost one-half. To be sure, according to data 
from the same administration of statistics, the crime rate in 
the republic went down 18 percent last year, and the president 
stated officially that he has put an end to racketeering in 
Elista (which incidentally was confirmed by merchants at stands 
operating around the clock). 
  Stratification in terms of assets and unemployment is the 
most serious problem in Kalmykia, which has been aggravated 
precisely in recent years. The gates of the Monitor 
demonstration combine are closed; the workers have been on 
furlough since January. Most of those who worked at the Zvezda 
plant where the labor biography of the Ilyumzhinov brothers 
began are also taking a break. 
  However, Ilyumzhinov is upbeat despite everything. He 
promises that the largest tanning factory in the Caucasus will 
be started up. The Lockheed company, which intends to build a 
large international airport in the vicinity of Elista, should 
begin operations in the same month. However, the plant is indeed 
half a step away from "burying China and Germany under Kalmyk 
products," whereas everything concerning the airport is still 
hazy. 
  Elista is quite clean; old ladies with brooms are seen in 
the 
morning. The city is quite festive--the president pays for 
concerts on a square in front of the parliament building which 
have already been visited by the "stars." Milk is 500 rubles a 
liter, and hardly any beggars can be seen. However, many people 
expected more of the president. At present Ilyumzhinov 
frequently reminds us that his program of transformations is 
devised for five years, while only one year has passed so far.

<F P=106> [Petition by V.S. Grigoriadi, V.I. Golovlev, A.L. Kushnar, </F>
A.P. Pochinok, and V.P. Utkin, State Duma deputies from 
Chelyabinsk, addressed to Russian Federation President B. 
Yeltsin, dated 10 March 1994, under the rubric "It Is Official": 
"Deputies of the State Duma From Chelyabinsk Ask the President 
To Appoint a New Head of Administration"] 
  [Text] The press has already reported that Deputies 
of the State Duma from Chelyabinsk V. Grigoriadi, V. Golovlev, 
A. Kushnar, A. Pochinok, and V. Utkin have sent a letter to 
President of Russia B. Yeltsin in which they make a critical 
assessment of the socioeconomic and public policy situation in 
the oblast and ask that the issue of appointing a new head of 
the oblast administration be considered. 
  The deputies have approached the CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY 
editorial office with a request to familiarize the voters with 
the full text of their appeal and made it available for 
publication. 
  To President of the Russian Federation B.N. Yeltsin 
  Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich! 
  All the deputies representing the 4 million inhabitants of 
Chelyabinsk Oblast in the Federal Assembly are appealing to you. 
  We support the economic transformations you are 
implementing. 
Although we belong to different political groups (Russia's 
Choice, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord), a problem has 
brought us together which, as we see it, has reached crisis 
level--the state of affairs in Chelyabinsk Oblast. 
  Since we have a realistic notion of how complex and 
contradictory the political and economic situation in Russia is, 
we are convinced that resolution of the main problems associated 
with the processes of reforms and reinforcement of the Russian 
state in leading industrial territories, of which Chelyabinsk 
Oblast is one, would have proceeded more effectively and in 
keeping with the main bearings and directions you have clearly 
outlined in the Message to the Federal Assembly Deputies had the 
executive authorities of regions pursued the course of the 
president unswervingly and consistently. 
  Owing to the consolidation of progressive forces in 
Chelyabinsk Oblast, our territory was one of the regions that 
unconditionally supported the president and the course pursued 
by him. This is confirmed by the results of voting during the 
election of the president of the Russian Federation in June 1991 
and the referendum in April 1993. Unfortunately the opposite 
trend has been registered lately: a fall in the rating of the 
president and his course. Here is proof: 
  --the results of voting on 12 December 1993 (our territory 
ended up being the only one among the krays and oblasts to not 
have representatives on the Federation Council); 
  --voting on ratification of the Constitution came close to 
failing, which gave our political opponents the pretext to call 
the results of the vote into doubt; 
  --a considerable reinvigoration of oppositionist forces in 
the region has been registered, primarily the rapid growth of 
the number of supporters of the Liberal-Democratic Party of 
Russia. 
  Abuse of the president's trust is becoming a practice 
expressed in violations of the law and deliberate failure to 
carry out the edicts of the president and is creating an 
environment of irresponsibility and permissiveness. This is 
confirmed by the findings of a commission of the Central 
Electoral Commission which operated in February of this year 
concerning failure to carry out a number of presidential edicts, 
a letter from Deputy Chairman of the Government A. Chubays (No. 
ACh-15/942 dated 7 February 1994) concerning violation of the 
Law "On Privatization of State and Municipal Property in the 
Russian Federation" and Edicts of the President No. 1231 dated 
14 December 1992 and No. 2284 dated 24 December 1993, by the 
head of the Chelyabinsk Oblast Administration. Besides, social 
tensions in the oblast are being fueled by the periodically 
developing scandals associated with the operations of the local 
authorities and exhibiting a criminal coloring, including those 
related to issues of foreign economic activities, foodstuffs 
procurement, uncontrolled disbursement and theft of funds from 
the budget, and so on. 
  To our mind, all this has resulted from the fact that head 
of 
the Oblast Administration V.P. Solovyev has focused all his 
activities on retaining personal power to the detriment of the 
direct functions of executive structures. The administration has 
been afflicted with continuous squabbling and the absence of a 
genuine program of action for implementation of the president's 
course. In recent months three first deputy heads of the oblast 
administration and a number of heads of cities and rayons, who 
"ventured" to raise the issue of uncontrolled disbursement of 
the budget and strange connections between the administration 
and a number of commercial structures, have been dismissed. 
  The head of the oblast administration justifies ostentatious 
disregard for legislative and regulatory acts, dubious 
operations involving budget funds, and his arbitrary personnel 
practices by actions allegedly coordinated with first aide to 
the president V. Ilyushin, which causes bewilderment and 
profound doubts and directly discredits the president. 
  We believe that the head of the oblast administration does 
not meet the requirement for a leader who is capable of 
consolidating progressive forces of the oblast in order to 
implement the presidential course of economic and political 
transformations. 
  Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich! 
  The socioeconomic and public policy situation in the oblast 
is becoming critical and requires that measures be immediately 
taken to reinforce executive power and build confidence in it. 
  We ask that you consider the issue of appointing a new head. 
In the event it is necessary to set up an interdepartmental 
commission on the situation in the oblast, we ask that deputies 
from our oblast be included in it. 
  Respectfully, 
  [Signed] V.S. Grigoriadi (district 182) 
  V.I. Golovlev (district 183) 
  A.L. Kushnar (district 184) 
  A.P. Pochinok (district 185) 
  V.P. Utkin (district 186) 
  10 March 1994

<F P=106> [Article by A. Yalovenko, chief of the Chelyabinsk Oblast </F>
Regional Organization of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia 
and member of the Central Committee of the Liberal-Democratic 
Party of Russia, under the rubric "Point of View": "Elections, 
After All!"] 
  [Text] The Regulations on Elections in Chelyabinsk Oblast 
have been confirmed by a decree of the head of the oblast 
administration. Its main principles differ considerably from the 
proposals that were developed by a working group under 
representative of the president V.V. Seleznev consisting of the 
activists of various parties and movements. 
  The regulations are being vigorously discussed in the local 
newspaper. An interview with deputy head of the Oblast 
Administration B.A. Mizrakhi has been published in which he 
tried to justify individual provisions of the regulations. Notes 
have been published in which the author scares readers with the 
strength and cohesion of opposition parties before the election 
to the oblast duma. 
  All this was preceded by a heated debate and discussions 
among the representatives of various parties and movements 
concerning development of the draft regulations on the duma 
itself. Surprisingly, parties that are absolutely different in 
terms of their directions found a common language in developing 
the regulations; mutually satisfactory compromises were found. 
Parties with a democratic orientation also took part in this: 
There were representatives of the RDDR [Russian Movement for 
Democratic Reforms] and the Republican Party. B.A. Mizrakhi also 
participated. Strangely, following attacks against him, B.A. 
Mizrakhi by way of justifying himself made the quite strange 
assertion that proposals for the Regulations on Elections had 
been developed mainly by the representatives of communist and 
national-patriotic parties and movements. 
  The very process of the development of proposals for the 
Regulations on Elections exemplified the fact that the parties 
can cooperate fruitfully in the oblast duma. Thus, the LDPR 
[Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] proposed to insert 
restrictive requirements for candidates for oblast duma deputy 
into the Regulations on Elections in terms of age (no younger 
than 30), educational standard (higher education), specific 
activities (mostly economists, lawyers, economic managers), and 
residence (residing in the oblast for no less than five years). 
Although these requirements were not adopted, the LDPR did agree 
to compromise proposals that were worked out jointly. 
  It is sad that the oblast administration was not aware or 
did 
not wish to be aware of this effort of the parties and movements 
and did not take into account the jointly developed proposals. 
  It is now becoming clear that the executive authorities 
cannot and do not want to yield to the representative 
authorities. The main principles of the Regulations on Elections 
confirmed by the oblast administration facilitate this. 
  First of all, nomination of candidates by party lists is 
omitted, and only the majority system is used. So, what is 
happening: They used to talk about the development of a 
multiparty system all the time, but after receiving the results 
of elections by party lists on 12 December 1993, which they (but 
not everyone else) found strange, they began to talk about 
parties and movements being underdeveloped here, about their not 
reflecting the interests of the population. Of course, it might 
be that the parties with a democratic orientation are weak in 
our oblast. However, that the parties of an opposition variety 
are gaining strength is a real fact which neither the 
administration nor the press rejects. To our mind, this was the 
only reason for using solely the majority system in the 
forthcoming elections to the oblast duma. 
  Second, there is the numerical strength of the 
representative 
organ. In his interview B.A. Mizrakhi gives examples of the 
numerical strength of the dumas in various oblasts of Russia 
while failing to mention the oblasts in which the numerical 
strength of the duma has been confirmed to be 50 deputies; 
meanwhile, about one-half of the oblasts are that way. The 
design in this instance is also clear: The small numerical 
strength of the duma gives the administration an opportunity to 
manage it, to make it a "puppet" duma. It is clear to all that 
the smaller numerical strength of the duma means taking a small 
number of opinions into account, frequently failing to get a 
quorum, and having a poor connection between the duma and all 
strata of the population. After all, even in Tsarist Russia, 
proportionate numbers of representatives from various social 
strata--the merchants, the nobility, the craftsmen, the 
Cossacks, and so on--were elected to the Chelyabinsk Duma. 
  Third, there is the introduction of very stringent 
requirements for the collection of signatures in favor of 
nominating a candidate. After all, 4 percent of the total number 
of voters in the district translates into a number upward of 
7,000 signatures. It sufficed to collect 5,000 signatures for 
nomination even in the election to the State Duma. Of course, it 
is good for the oblast administration to believe that the traits 
of a candidate for the oblast duma should be superior to those 
of our candidates to the State Duma; however, common sense seems 
to be absent in this instance. After all, collecting this number 
of signatures will prevent the participation of many 
knowledgeable, sensible specialists in the election to the 
oblast duma who are not associated with the executive 
authorities or parties and movements because the collection of 
signatures calls for a great organizational effort and 
considerable financial outlays. It would be interesting to learn 
what financial outlays are required for this purpose if the 
press printed the financial reports of contenders for deputy 
positions in the 12 December 1993 election. Besides, the 
employees of personnel departments and housing maintenance 
offices could tell a lot about the collection of signatures in 
favor of individual candidates for deputies and blocs of parties 
and movements. It is clear that either candidates with ties to 
the administration or those abusing their official position in 
the process will have the advantage. 
  The existence of these "strange" shortcomings in the 
Regulations on Elections was also noted by our State Duma 
deputies at a meeting with the TV viewers of the oblast. 
  It is now possible to discuss the shortcomings or virtues of 
the Regulations on Elections. However, they have been approved 
and have the force of a local law from which we should proceed. 
Given that compliance with the law is one of the main principles 
of the LDPR, the Chelyabinsk Regional Organization of the LDPR 
will strictly proceed from the approved Regulations on 
Elections, all their shortcomings notwithstanding. 
  With cooperation from the leading specialists of the oblast, 
the activists of our LDPR organization have completed the 
development of an election program of the party for activities 
in the oblast duma. We expect to make it available for 
publication in the press shortly. 
  Our aspiration to have a greater number of LDPR members 
working in the oblast duma is natural. At present the party has 
at its disposal in Chelyabinsk Oblast skilled economists and 
lawyers, economic managers and workers, clerical employees, and 
also representatives of the creative arts intelligentsia, that 
is, an active contingent that can accomplish a lot in these 
difficult times in the oblast. 
  Spring is coming, and the time of renewal in nature along 
with it. We would very much like this to be also springtime in 
politics, economics, and the social sphere, so that renewal will 
affect every one of us, so that everyone will perceive the 
measure of his responsibility for the future and for Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with A.P. Kozachenko, chairman of the Chelyabinsk </F>
Oblast Committee for Land Resources and Land Development, by Yu. 
Fomin, CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY correspondent; place and date not 
given: "The Great Reallocation Is Not Over, but More Than a 
Million Landowners Have Appeared in the Three Years of Land 
Reform in the Oblast"] 
  [Text] [Fomin] Anatoliy Pavlovich, how would you evaluate 
the situation with oblast land resources at the beginning of 
1994? Has the land reallocation that started in 1990 been 
completed? 
  [Kozachenko] Three years have passed under the sign of a 
great reallocation of land. It can be said without exaggeration: 
A revolution has taken place in land relationships--the monopoly 
of the right of the state to possess land has ended. Given the 
total oblast area of 8.8529 million hectares, 3.2081 million 
have been transferred to the ownership of citizens, joint-stock 
companies, and associations. There has been a transfer of 1.2195 
million hectares of land resources to the jurisdiction of city, 
settlement, and village administrations that were also earmarked 
most of all for personal subsidiary plots, hayfields, and 
pastureland. 
  [Fomin] What does the owner of a land parcel represent today 
in a generalized way? How many owners are registered on the 
territory of the oblast--private individual proprietors, farmer 
and peasant-owned farms, joint-stock companies, and firms? How 
much land is left under the jurisdiction of state structures? 
  [Kozachenko] According to the status on 1 February 1994, 
more 
than 400,000 subsidiary plots with a total area of 66,700 
hectares are registered in the oblast. In three years 40,000 
citizens were granted land sectors for an area of 5,200 hectares 
for individual housing construction, and of this, 2,600 hectares 
were allocated to the ownership of villages and settlements free 
of charge. 
  Seven thousand one hundred and thirty-two peasant farms were 
organized on an area of 415,400 hectares, and of these, 90,300 
hectares of agricultural land were allocated free of charge, or 
21.8 percent of the total area. The remaining area was turned 
over for leasing for a period of up to 50 years, with the right 
of subsequent redemption. 
  In an area of 4,291 hectares seven communal-ancestral farms 
were organized on which the age-old Cossack principle of land 
use is being revived. The communes are operating in Agapovskiy, 
Verkhneuralskiy, Kartalinskiy, Krasnoarmeyskiy, Nyazepetrovskiy, 
and Sosnovskiy Rayons and the city of Yuzhnouralsk. One hundred 
and four hectares of land were turned over to the ownership of 
the communes free of charge. 
  Today 386,700 citizens of our oblast own land plots 
earmarked 
for gardening. Their total area is 31,400 hectares. All told, 
189,400 hectares were transferred to the ownership of more than 
800,000 citizens. 
  Significant changes have occurred in public agriculture. On 
the basis of the former kolkhozes and sovkhozes, 215 joint-stock 
companies and associations were established, to whom 3.0187 
million hectares of agricultural land were turned over to 
collective-share and collective-joint ownership. Today we have 
23 kolkhozes left that own 3 percent of the agricultural land 
and 25 state agricultural enterprises with commodity production 
that have 4 percent of the agricultural land. Thus the oblast 
disposes of redistribution funds that today amount to 403,600 
hectares, or a total of 5.5 percent of the agricultural land. A 
large part of this fund has been turned over to leasing, to 
temporary use by agricultural enterprises, and to farmers. 
  These are the results of our work: 84.5 percent of the 
agricultural land of the oblast has been transferred to citizen 
or collective ownership. The total number of landowners and land 
users is more than 1.71 million. 
  [Fomin] Anatoliy Pavlovich, in what condition is the land 
cadastre of the oblast? 
  [Kozachenko] In accordance with a government decree, owing 
to 
the resources received from payments from land, we have begun 
work on inventorying land of population centers and the 
establishment of six automated cadastre bureaus: three--in rural 
rayons--of the most numerous land users (Sosnovskiy, 
Krasnoarmeyskiy, Chebarkulskiy) and three in the cities of 
Chelyabinsk, Magnitogorsk, and Miass. The oblast committee has 
organized work for the establishment of program support of the 
cadastre. We will continue this work in 1994, and its results 
will depend on the volume of financing. We prepare an annual 
report on the status of the land fund of the oblast, and can 
provide full information on any rayon. Incidentally, this 
material can be used by any organizations that work with land. 
Although I will note that it is difficult to set up proper 
registration without the establishment of an automated system of 
land cadastre. 
  Last year the oblast land committee developed a program for 
monitoring land in Chelyabinsk Oblast. Fifteen scientific 
production organizations were involved in implementation of the 
program. Five stationary sites for conducting regular 
observations over the status of land resources of the oblast 
were set up in various nature-climatic zones. This will make it 
possible to more fully evaluate the influence of economic 
activity on the condition of the environment. 
  [Fomin] On 29 September 1993 CHELYABINSK RABOCHIY talked 
about pseudo-farmers in the Uvelskiy Rayon, about people who 
became owners of land but actually did not work on it. How did 
your committee react to this article? Is there an effective 
system for monitoring the rational use of land resources 
according to the law at the present time? 
  [Kozachenko] As in any business, we unfortunately are not 
without deficiencies. Yes, your newspapers wrote about the 
pseudo-farmers in Uvelskiy Rayon, about those people who 
received land parcels but did not intend to work on them 
themselves. The rayon land committee sent each one of them a 
written warning, first of all to those who came under the action 
of the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation of 4 
April 1992 No. 361 "On the Fight Against Corruption in the Civil 
Service System." However, the procurator of the rayon in his 
presentation explained to the committee about exceeding 
authority in the resolution of these questions. Thus, farmers 
like this have their defenders, although the land committee is 
undertaking decisive measures in the fight against the violation 
of land legislation and in monitoring the rational and effective 
use of land. 
  As a result of such checks, decrees were published by the 
heads of administration of Yetkulskiy and Chebarkulskiy Rayons 
concerning the elimination of the subsidiary plot Groznetskoye 
of the trust Uralneftegazstroy consisting of an area of 2,444 
hectares and the transfer of the confiscated land to the 
Karatabanskiy sovkhoz for agricultural use, and also concerning 
the confiscation of 150 hectares of arable land from oblast 
psychoneurological hospital No. 2 and their transfer to the 
rayon redistribution fund. 
  According to materials of land inventories conducted in 
1993, 
800 hectares of ineffectively used land were identified on the 
territory of Yetkulskiy and Sosnovskiy Rayons and transferred to 
the redistribution fund. 
  Regarding the Petushok horticultural association, the oblast 
committee prepared materials, and a decree of the head of 
administration of Sosnovskiy Rayon was adopted on the 
confiscation of land parcels from horticulturists who did not 
begin to develop the land parcels in three years. 
  [Fomin] The editorial mail brings us information that 
ordinary citizens at times are unable to gain possession of land 
for personal plots and land shares in joint-stock companies. 
Ivan Danilovich Pigarev from the village of Nagaybakskiy writes, 
in particular, that he used a personal plot of 0.50 hectares for 
36 years (he is a participant of the war), and now he is being 
given only 0.16 hectares. Valentina Aleksandrovna Lukyan worked 
for 23 years on the Belonosovskiy sovkhoz. But she took a 
pension in another place. She was refused a land share by the 
Belonosovskiy joint-stock company. In brief, what can you say to 
these people? 
  [Kozachenko] Commenting on these letters, I can say that in 
neither case did officials violate land legislation with respect 
to them. However, it is possible to help these citizens. I.D. 
Pigarev can receive for his personal plot a section of land 
outside the boundaries of the construction project of the 
village, and V.A. Lukyan, if she is able to work the land, can 
get an average rayon share free of charge for the organization 
of a peasant farm in accordance with Article 60 of the Land Code 
of the Russian Federation from the lands of the rayon's special 
fund. 
  [Fomin] In October 1993 the Edict of the President of Russia 
"On Regulating Land Relations and Development of Agrarian Reform 
in Russia," which granted owners right to sell land plots, was 
signed. When will the first competition (auction) on the sale of 
land be held in the oblast? What will be offered for sale to 
those who take part in it? 
  [Kozachenko] Of late, more and more citizens have become 
interested in questions about the purchase and sale of land 
parcels. The Law of the Russian Federation "On the Right of 
Citizens of the Russian Federation To Receive Private Property 
and To Sell Land Parcels for the Conduct of Personal Subsidiary 
and Summer Home Farming, Gardening, and Individual Housing 
Construction" grants the right to citizens who received land 
parcels as private property for the aforementioned purposes to 
sell them to other citizens of Russia. This right is affirmed by 
the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation "On 
Regulating Land Relations and Development of Agrarian Reform in 
Russia." Purchase and sale of land transactions are conducted by 
citizens independently at the place of the location of the 
parcels with the formulation of a deed of purchase. 
  Land parcels belonging to citizens as personal property will 
be sold at auctions on their petition. Moreover, the organs of 
local administration can offer for sale at auction vacant 
parcels that are valuable because of their location for 
individual housing construction, the accommodation of summer 
homes, and other purposes. 
  The edict of the president of the Russian Federation 
authorizes the sale of land parcels acquired by citizens free of 
charge in the form of shares in the reorganization of kolkhozes 
and sovkhozes. However, the lack of a sale-purchase mechanism 
for lands of agricultural significance hinders this process. On 
the whole it must be said that land legislation has begun to lag 
behind today's practical tasks.

<F P=106> [Article by VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Mark Viktorov: "Number </F>
of Private Property Owners in the Kray Is Increasing"] 
  [Text] Privatization in Maritime Kray has passed the 
1,000 mark: Exactly this number of enterprises, according to the 
data of kray statisticians, today moved into private or 
joint-stock company ownership. It can thereby be claimed that a 
private property market branch of the economy is being actively 
formed, although the main part (80 percent) of produced products 
still falls to the share of state enterprises. 
  Destatization is now being accomplished mainly through the 
sale of enterprises in competition or auction, and only 12 
percent of the enterprises have gone through a full or partial 
auction. The largest number of sales (54 percent) belongs to 
retail or wholesale trade, and also consumer services for the 
population, construction, and public catering. Agriculture has 
been affected least of all by privatization in the kray--only 
one percent of enterprises have changed ownership in this sector. 
  Privatization of large and average enterprises is being 
implemented by means of auction. Of the three variants of 
privileges offered labor collectives, preference is given to the 
second variant, which allows the possession of a controlling 
package of stocks. 
  The relatively low value of property of enterprises of 
municipal ownership (on average amounting to 590,000 rubles 
[R]), and the relatively small-scale investment that is 
necessary after their acquisition naturally attract the 
attention of commercial structures, which at times results in 
severe competition in trades and, accordingly, a high sales rate. 
  As a result of privatization, R6 billion was received this 
year (including resources received in the years 1992-1993), of 
which a large part (63 percent) was transferred to the budget of 
the territory of Maritime Kray. 
  Not long ago Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, governor of the kray, 
approved a privatization program for 1994. Its main objectives 
are expansion of the strata of private property owners as the 
main formation of market relations, completion of check 
privatization, further auctioning of large and average 
enterprises, mainly in the production sphere, and attraction to 
it of additional investments. In principle this is supposed to 
increase the effectiveness of the kray's economy, create a 
competitive environment in the production sphere, and promote 
the development of a fund market in the kray. 
  According to this program it is planned to privatize all 
told 
more than 500 enterprises and facilities in 1994, of which 82 
are federal and 43 kray, and 376 are municipally owned. Total 
receipts from privatization should amount to R12.5 billion for 
the year, and R7.5 in privatization checks. 
  In the first half year alone it is planned to offer shares 
of 
stock of about 200 joint-stock companies at specialized check 
auctions. It is planned to offer stock of the joint-stock 
company Dalzavod (40,800 units) and Vostokproyektverf (1,800 
units) at an interregional all-Russian check auction. 
  A Maritime Kray central depository system will be put into 
operation this year, which will make it possible to speed up 
completion of transactions and follow the securities market 
outside the exchange. In addition, a scheme will be laid in the 
central depository system that will make it possible to rule out 
the opportunity for transactions of several stockholders in the 
very same securities. 
  The progress of housing privatization has to be discussed 
separately. According to the information of the aforementioned 
statisticians, on 1 April 189,000 apartments were privatized in 
the kray (8.9852 million square meters of housing), of which 
16,531 apartments (770,000 square meters of housing) were 
privatized in the first quarter of 1994. Moreover, 15 unoccupied 
apartments were sold, including three apartments to 
organizations. The total value from the sale of apartments to 
private ownership was R60.7 million. 
  In January-March, according to a directive of the president 
of the Russian Federation, servicemen were assigned 27 
apartments, which is of course insufficient. All told, from the 
moment of the issuance of the president's directive the military 
were assigned 99 apartments, which is 7 percent of that planned.

<F P=106> [Report of head of administration of Novosibirsk Oblast I.I. </F>
Indinok at the scientific-practical conference on 18 April 1994] 
  [Text] Esteemed conference participants! 
  When thinking over the structure of this report, considering 
the complex of difficult social and economic problems in the 
oblast, and trying to find the most notorious main link in this 
chain of problems, I discovered that many of my assessments, 
notes, and approaches are fairly closely correlated with ideas 
that lie at the basis of the president's recent Message to the 
Federal Assembly, "On Strengthening the Russian State," or, 
rather, with its main idea which is reflected in the actual 
title of this message. Its essence is on everyone's list--we 
must look for a way out of the economic crisis in the 
strengthening of state regulation of the economy. Obviously, 
this is also the link that will make it possible for us to undo 
the entire knot of economic problems. 
  This being the case, we at the level of components of the 
Federation must, perhaps, without lapsing into sophistries, 
concentrate our efforts on implementing the idea of 
strengthening the state principle in regulating economic 
processes. In order to verify my conclusion I turned for advice 
to an assembly of leading scientists and specialists from 
various spheres of activity in our oblast whom we asked to 
attend a conference last Friday in order to discuss the outlines 
of the draft of the recommendations for today's conference. The 
opinion of this assembly of Novosibirsk intellectual elite was 
unanimous: In our oblast it is time to take regulation of the 
economy firmly into the hands of the state, since the so-called 
liberal but actually uncivilized market into which radical 
reformers have led us is ruining Russia and leading all of us to 
a socioeconomic disaster. 
  This principle, I must admit, provided a clear orientation 
for the preparation of the present report. As an outline I took 
a number of constructive points from the president's message 
plus our own proposals, and in these areas and I have considered 
what can be done to realize the earmarked approaches at the 
level of a component of the Federation. Here, naturally, I 
proceeded from the realities of Novosibirsk Oblast, which are 
typical of many regions of Russia. 
  First, in order to give participants in the conference an 
idea of the socioeconomic base used for developing our 
proposals, I will give a brief description of the condition of 
the economy of Novosibirsk Oblast and try to show the price it 
has paid for the radical reforms. 
  The economy of our oblast and its social sphere have relied 
in past decades on branches that today have been driven into a 
situation of poverty. These are science-intensive industrial 
production, including the defense complex, agriculture, science, 
the higher school, and education. Of course, you are also well 
aware that the oblast's economic potential, its branch 
structure, and the dynamics of social processes, as with all 
other Russian regions, have been determined, unfortunately, not 
by local conditions but by directive centralized plans, many of 
which, unfortunately, have run counter to economic-geographic 
and, as is apparent now, market preconditions for the 
development of the territory. Nonetheless by the middle of the 
1980's, in order to implement the most important state tasks in 
Novosibirsk, a powerful economic complex was created with a 
progressive economic structure, a very high proportion of 
science-intensive modern productions, and the most skilled work 
force. Although the extraction industry made up only 2 percent 
of it, in terms of volumes of the oblast industrial production 
it occupied fourth place in Siberia (after Tyumen and Kemerovo 
Oblasts and Krasnoyarsk Kray), in agriculture--second after 
Altay Kray, and in terms of total economic potential--fourth 
place on the territory of Siberia and the Far East. In a word, 
the oblast was one of the most important in Russia. 
  The president's message devotes a great deal of attention to 
the cost of the reforms in Russia. The president is obviously 
right when he notes that economic reform is not painless and is 
not free and that losses are inevitable. But the painful 
phenomena turned out to be especially severe in our oblast and 
the cost of the reforms was so high that practically everything 
we had went to pay for them. It is difficult to explain to 
people what they paid for at such a price. Incidentally, it 
should be noted that Novosibirsk Oblast was not among the 
victims of the first stage of perestroyka when the sharp 
reduction of centralized investments and the depression in the 
raw material branches began. Right up until the end of 1991 it 
retained its positions in the Russian economy. The collapse 
began the moment the so-called market reforms began to be 
forced. During a little more than two years there was a sharp 
deterioration of our positions in the economy of Russia and our 
economic position in the main branches became intolerable. 
  The reason for the high cost of reform lies in the 
peculiarities of the structure of the oblast economy to which I 
wish to draw your attention. In order not to be accused of local 
egocentrism, I shall use the analytical materials of the World 
Bank. Thus, according to information from this international 
financial institution, in 1990 Novosibirsk occupied third place 
in Russia in terms of degree of militarization of the economy. 
The proportion of people employed at enterprises of the defense 
complex in the overall number of industrial production personnel 
was 43.5 percent (the only ones higher than us were 
Udmurtia--55.3 percent and Saratov Oblast--50.9 percent). The 
overall number of workers at defense enterprises of Novosibirsk 
Oblast (according to World Bank figures) exceeded the number of 
people employed in the military-industrial complex of all of 
Eastern Siberia (we have 172,500, and Eastern Siberia--167,500) 
and was approximately equal to the number of people employed in 
the military-industrial complex of all of the Far East, where 
the figure was 176,200. Thus the blow dealt to the country 
during 1992-1993 by the reformers' policy in fighting against 
the military-industrial complex caused many regions damage of 
varying degrees of severity--in some places it was tolerable, 
but for our oblast and especially the city of Novosibirsk--it 
was murderous and largely irreversible. 
  The conversion of defense enterprises, regardless of how 
fervently and at what a high level it was discussed, will remain 
on paper until real resources are invested in it. What is 
allotted from the budget for conversion is more like a 
propaganda experiment than target investments. In 1993 
allocations for conversion in Russia as a whole amounted to 870 
billion rubles [R], which is little more than the credit 
investments of Inkombank alone. And the distribution of these 
funds was extremely unfair and very subjective, mainly according 
to the criterion of proximity to the hand that gave them out 
(and Novosibirsk, as we know, is a long way from Moscow). The 
aforementioned investments were not only unable to stop the 
catastrophic decline of the defense industry; they could not 
even slow it down. 
  During the past two years of reform the oblast 
military-industrial complex has managed to continue to exist 
without sources of development and almost without any structural 
rearrangement, scaring up loans and subsidies from time to time. 
Now that the last reserves of the enterprises have been 
exhausted and, as a result of the ill-considered reforms, the 
prices of many kinds of raw material have exceeded world prices, 
the collapse of all industry has begun--not only defense, but 
also purely civilian industry--a large part of the domestic 
economy has reached the verge of complete bankruptcy. 
  The legal excesses and galloping inflation greatly 
exacerbated the investment climate. Commercial banks grant 
practically no credit for investment projects since it is 
disadvantageous to invest in the production sphere as compared 
to servicing short-term commercial operations. This leaves 
industrial production without any future. 
  Among the main areas of specialization of Novosibirsk Oblast 
are science and personnel training. Before the beginning of 
perestroyka (1985) we had 85,000 people employed in the branch 
entitled "Science and Scientific Service." In terms of the 
proportion of science in the fixed production capital and the 
overall number of workers, the oblast occupied first place in 
the Soviet Union, outstripping Moscow and Leningrad. We were 
proud of our three academies, 15 VUZ's [higher educational 
institutions], and powerful branch science, justifiably assuming 
that this was our main capital, which was quite competitive by 
world standards. Let me note, incidentally, that according to 
assessments of the most eminent economists of the West, 
including Nobel prize winner Solow, over a long historical 
period 85 percent of the economic growth was provided as a 
result of scientific and technical progress. Therefore financing 
science is the most effective investment of money in the 
development of the economy. 
  The surrealistic market in which we have now found ourselves 
has shown that there simply is no effective demand for rendering 
scientific services under the conditions of a total crisis. This 
pertains to both fundamental and applied research. Yet there has 
been a sharp increase in the demand for Russian and especially 
Siberian scientists abroad, which is causing an ever increasing 
brain drain from Russia to other countries. Centralized 
financing at best covers 30 percent of the expenditures in 
comparable prices compared to the level the same academy of 
sciences had in 1990. As a result world-renowned scientific 
schools and collectives are falling apart and the influx of 
youth into science has come to a halt. There is an analogous 
situation in higher education. Russia is losing its future and 
the oblast and local budgets contain no resources for supporting 
science and the higher school. 
  The collapse of the economy was reflected most fatally in 
culture. While in past years it was financed according to the 
so-called residual principle, today nothing at all is left for 
culture. The destruction of the culture of Novosibirsk--the 
world famous music schools, the renowned theater collectives, 
artists, writers, excellent libraries--would cause harm not only 
to Russia but to all world civilization. God forbid that such a 
thing should happen. 
  Another leading branch of specialization of our oblast is 
agriculture. Its share along with branches for processing 
agricultural products is approximately one-third of all the 
economic potential. To be sure, the agrarian branch, as in all 
developed countries of the world, has always existed under 
conditions of large state subsidies, and this has made it 
possible to keep consumer prices at a fairly low level so that 
these products are available to all the population. Now there 
are almost none. Today the sharp reduction of the buying power 
of the population and also the impossibility of really 
maintaining parity of prices between the city and the country 
are driving agricultural producers into an abyss. By the end of 
last year wholesale prices of means of production for the 
agro-industrial complex increased 13.3-fold, including for 
machines and equipment for animal husbandry--14.5-fold, and 
diesel fuel--18-fold. Procurement prices for agricultural 
products increased only 11.8-fold during that same period. The 
continued unrestrained growth of prices for energy sources, 
agricultural equipment, spare parts, fertilizers, and means of 
plant protection have led to a situation where even the 
strongest farms are unable not only to acquire new tractors and 
combines but even to repair the existing ones, which are in 
short supply. The fertility of the soil is being exhausted since 
the application of mineral fertilizers has practically stopped. 
Agriculture in the oblast has been thrown back decades. 
  Late payments for bread, milk, and meat that have already 
been consumed and credit under extortionate conditions of 
180-213 percent are destroying the financial base of 
agricultural production. Now that the banks are encountering 
problems of distributing credit resources even in trade, the 
existing rates for agricultural enterprises like, incidentally, 
those of industry, are simply ruinous. Even under conditions of 
the sharp reduction of production volumes, grain, milk, and meat 
produced on the farms at the present time are going begging 
because of the exceptionally low buying power of the population. 
In the food ration of the impoverished population there is a 
reduction of the consumption of biologically necessary products. 
Macaroni items, bread, and potatoes have become basic in the 
nutrition of residents of our oblast. 
  The reform of agricultural enterprises has actually been 
reduced to changing signs without affecting the basic economic 
incentives in rural areas. Today the oblast, like all of Russia, 
has been faced with a dilemma: To have its own agricultural 
products, which are now more expensive, taking into account 
transportation costs and the price of energy sources, or to 
increase procurements from abroad of products that are less 
expensive and frequently of poorer quality. It would be more 
correct to put it like this: To encourage the hidden 
subsidization of importing foodstuffs through artificially 
maintaining the exchange rate of the ruble to the detriment of 
our own commodity producer. By following this path, you 
understand, we could arrive at complete dependency on the West 
for our food supply as well, so this is not only an economic 
issue but also a political one, and it cannot be resolved at the 
level of an individual oblast. Incidentally, the answer to it 
given in the president's message inspires hope. Indeed it is 
necessary to have (I quote) "a reasonable protectionist policy 
that protects the interests of domestic producers but without 
appreciable harm to the consumers." Let us hope that is the way 
it will be. 
  Speaking about the price of reforms for Novosibirsk Oblast, 
let me note that in terms of formal indicators which the 
higher-ups like to use to evaluate the course of the reforms, we 
have considerable achievements in the main areas of reform. 
Privatization of housing, trade, and industry is proceeding more 
rapidly in our oblast than the average for Russia. Indicators of 
the creation of farmer-run farms are at a high level and we have 
created a multitude of banks, investment funds, intermediary 
enterprises, and other institutions of the market 
infrastructure. Alas, all this, unfortunately, has so far not 
contributed to economic growth in the oblast or to raising the 
standard of living of most of its residents. 
  The conclusion from an analysis of the consolidated 
indicators of the development of the oblast is this: Its economy 
has actually entered a stage of reduced reproduction. In certain 
branches of the national economy the "eating up" of production 
capacities has become apparent and is reflected not only in the 
reduction of the residual value of fixed capital and the 
increase in the indicators of its wearing out, but also in the 
absolute reduction in physical terms. 
  The elimination of the commodity deficit is considered to be 
one of the main pluses of the radical reforms that have been 
conducted. Indeed this deficit has disappeared. It is possible 
to buy almost anything both on the consumer market and on the 
market for raw and processed materials and also on the market 
for contracting work. Incidentally, even before the reforms 
there was no deficit on our market portrayed in physical items, 
which we call a flea market. The only commodity that is still in 
short supply is money, and the whole country, unfortunately, has 
become like a flea market. The lack of regulation of the 
processes, the failure to account for the turnover of goods and 
incomes, and the lack of quality control of goods have become 
typical for the entire economy of Russia. 
  An analysis of the minimum consumer budget of the population 
of Novosibirsk Oblast shows that workers of the majority of 
branches do not have sufficient money to support at a bare 
minimum not only their children but even themselves. Only 
workers in transportation, communications, construction, and 
wholesale trade had wages at the level of the minimum consumer 
budget at the beginning of this year, that is, they could 
support themselves. At the same time workers of the 
financial-credit sphere, insurance institutions, and energy 
engineering had wages that averaged twice the minimum consumer 
budget. 
  The consequences of such a state of affairs are extremely 
severe. For enterprises and organizations living on the sale of 
goods to the population this means ruin and ultimately 
liquidation. As an example one can give the state of affairs in 
consumers' cooperation. At the present time it is conducting 
trade in 1,231 population points which do not have a permanent 
trade network. The fact that one-third of the consumer 
cooperative stores (about 1,000) are operating at a loss becomes 
threatening since, as experience shows, the rural population 
points start losing population after the schools are closed and 
they die out after the store is closed. For the individual 
resident, the specific family, and society as a whole the 
situation in which monetary incomes are below the subsistence 
minimum means moral and physical degradation. 
  As a result of the fact that prices of food products 
increased more rapidly than the nominal incomes of the 
population, there has been a marked deterioration of the 
structure of nutrition. I have already discussed this. Medical 
services and the condition of the environment have become worse 
and crime and the nervous-psychological strain on people have 
increased. As a result, practically all demographic indicators 
have gotten worse. In 1992 for the first time in many decades 
the death rate in the oblast exceeded the birth rate. In 1993 as 
compared to the preceding year the birth rate dropped by another 
17 percent and the death rate increased by 25 percent. As a 
result, the natural attrition of the population in the oblast 
during the year (!) increased 16-fold. It is my deep conviction 
that under the conditions of peacetime no good wishes can 
justify such tendencies. Such is the price of the reforms in our 
oblast and, as I know from colleagues from other regions, it is 
just as great there. 
  Here is the last thing I would like to say before moving 
onto 
my proposals. All of us, esteemed compatriots, must be clearly 
aware of the fact that the people's patience is at an end. The 
rate and level of social stratification of society in Russia 
today is worthy of the Guinness Book of Records. The ratio 
between the wages of the most highly paid 10 percent of the 
citizens and the 10 percent of the members of society with the 
lowest pay in our country is 27:1. For comparison: In Sweden 
this coefficient is 11:1, in the United States--14:1. Such a 
strong stratification of the standards of living of the wealthy 
and the poor is fraught with serious social upheavals. And they 
can arise if this process continues. Even the reserves of the 
majority of key technological systems are at an end--energy 
engineering, gas lines, railroads, aviation, etc. If we do not 
radically change the situation in the state for the better, in 
the very near future we will inevitably encounter not only 
social upheaval but also technological and ecological 
catastrophes. 
  We have invited to the conference representatives of the 
government, federal ministries, the Soviet of the Federation, 
and the State Duma as well as leaders of many regions of the 
country in the hope that our concern will be understood 
correctly and measures, including those developed during the 
course of this conference, will find sympathetic support in the 
center as well. 
  Analyzing the socioeconomic situation that has developed, 
the 
oblast administration as early as the eve of 1994 came to the 
conclusion that it was impossible to quickly and painlessly 
improve the economic situation on any individual territory 
through any radical measures. Therefore the administration's 
program of actions for 1994 are based on the task of 
stabilization in the oblast economy and the creation of 
preconditions for future economic growth. Scholars and 
specialists of a number of scholarly institutions of the 
Siberian branches of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the 
Russian Agricultural Academy, the city's VUZ's, and leaders and 
workers of enterprises and organizations of various branches 
were enlisted to prepare proposals for this program. Most of 
these proposals are in the sections and therefore I request that 
participants in the conference consider the existing proposals 
and make additional ones during the course of the section 
meetings. 
  Which of the main areas make up the backbone of the 
stabilization program in the region? First of all, I repeat, 
state regulation of economic relations. It says in the 
presidential message (I quote): "The creation of a system for 
regulation of the market economy is not a step backward but 
movement forward, development of the reform, strengthening of 
the Russian state. There will never be a real market order in a 
poorly managed economy." For the regional level regulation of 
the economy means the development of clear-cut priorities for 
the economic and social policy and the conclusion of 
intraregional and interregional cartel agreements aimed at the 
survival and socioeconomic survival of regions, the development 
of a regional budget policy adapted to existing economic 
conditions, the formation of economic mechanisms providing for 
support of commodity producers, and alleviation of the crisis in 
industry, the agrarian sector, and the credit-financial sphere. 
  The president emphasized that if there were no structural 
rearrangement in the economy there would inevitably be 
structural degradation and that it has long been time for the 
government to straighten out its structural priorities and take 
action on the basis of this. In this area we are prepared to 
support any government actions. The oblast is already preparing 
and beginning to take measures for the development of a 
mechanization for streamlining, reprofiling, and reorganizing 
inefficient enterprises. Moreover, regional investment programs 
are being created in the main economic complexes. The Fund for 
Support of Entrepreneurship is selecting projects. 
  In the complex of anticrisis measures, part of which are 
under oblast jurisdiction, a most important position is occupied 
by measures for improving the tax policy. We also expect that in 
keeping with the points in the president's message and the 
decree of the Soviet of the Federation, in the near future 
changes will be made in the tax system in the direction of 
encouraging material production and resource saving. As the 
president promises, 1994 should be a year of real state support 
for the producer. The tax burden can be eased only in 
combination with effective measures for fighting against 
unaccounted-for commodity and monetary turnover. What kind of 
state is it that will allow the existence of a growing volume of 
unaccounted-for turnover which is obvious to everyone and is 
incapable of performing its controlling function? It has long 
been time for our state to be cured of its powerlessness. 
  In order to search for additional revenues and sources of 
financing expenditures from the oblast budget it is intended to 
use such measures as issuance of short-term funded loans, 
regulation of licensing activity, interaction between the 
administration and authorized banks, and new forms of direct and 
indirect tax regulation, taking advantage of the rights granted 
by Edict No. 2268 of the President of 22 December 1993. 
  Our anticrisis program has reflected measures for 
controlling 
blocks of shares and oblast-owned enterprises. Developing the 
corresponding edicts of the president, the administration is 
contributing to the creation of financial-industrial groups in 
industry and the agrarian sector of the economy and the 
utilization of trust forms of management, in spite of the fact 
that federal legislation is imperfect. We intend to step up 
control over the fulfillment of conditions for competition 
during privatization of state and municipally owned facilities 
without, however, transforming this control into a campaign for 
reprivatization. 
  The mechanism for support of rural commodity producers in 
the 
oblast is also changing. Based on the capabilities of the oblast 
budget, financial resources are being allotted only on the basis 
of agreements concluded for the delivery of products to the 
oblast food supply or the oblast food market. But there is not 
enough budget money to form a regional food fund in the 
necessary volume, even taking working capital into account. In 
keeping with the president's edict on liberalization of the 
grain market, the government will apparently have to accelerate 
the solution to the problem of sources of financing regional 
grain supplies. To this end it would be possible to use the 
funds allotted to the Roskhlevoprodukt Corporation last year for 
purchasing grain for regional needs. 
  Of the measures having to do with the social policy I will 
mention only the introduction of nonbudget forms of investment 
in housing construction, including the use of mortgages and 
funds of enterprises in the population. I would also like to 
hear proposals from participants in the conference regarding a 
solution to another problem that is critical, at least for 
us--growing abandonment of the departmental social sphere by 
enterprises when the local authorities do not have the funds or 
technical base to support it. 
  I want to discuss once again a couple of the most important 
issues whose resolution is possible only at the federal level 
because they are under the joint jurisdiction of the Federation 
and its components. 
  Among the most crucial problems requiring immediate solution 
I will single out the problem of nonpayments. Let me remind you 
that in its Decree "On the Crisis of Solvency in the Economy of 
the Russian Federation" the Federation Council proposed that 
before 15 April (today is already the 18th) the government and 
the Central Bank submit to the Federal Assembly a program for 
resolving this crisis. Among the most important measures the 
government and Central Bank were also instructed to retire 
indebtedness of the republic budget for 1993 taking price 
indexation into account. The state's position regarding the 
inflation factor in the state debt to the enterprises is 
affected and shows disdain for the enterprises. The state, which 
regularly defaults on its debts to the enterprises for long 
periods of time, does not intend to pay them the generally 
accepted fines while the suppliers for these enterprises, the 
state budget, and nonbudget funds do not forget to demand from 
0.7 to 1 percent for each day of defaulted payments, and the 
latter have the right to impose penalties without recourse to 
appeal. Frequently indebtedness of enterprises initiated by the 
state is covered by them with state funds, but they already have 
the character of credit at the same interest rate, which 
objectively cannot save the vast majority of enterprises of the 
production sphere. This kind of interaction between the state 
and the enterprises has nothing to do with economic methods of 
regulation, the goals of the reform, or the norms of the law. 
  Additionally, it was suggested that the government of the 
Russian Federation pay back to Russian enterprises the debts of 
the CIS states. There is a proverb: If there is time to throw 
stones there is time to pick them up. The entire country is 
waiting for concrete and effective actions from the government 
in this area. 
  As of 1 March of this year defaulted indebtedness of buyers 
to enterprises of the oblast alone amounted to R294 billion, and 
defaulted indebtedness of enterprises to the suppliers was R170 
billion. Defaulted indebtedness to the budget--R44 billion, and 
bank credit (also defaulted)--R15 billion. As you can see, for 
one oblast the figures are immense, more than a month's volume 
of sales from industry. Since this disease has affected the 
entire country, the formula for recovery must be sought through 
joint efforts. Here one cannot forget that the nonpayments 
crisis is a result of the overall crisis that has affected the 
country's economy and the deep impoverishment of the population. 
Emerging from this crisis will require a change in the paradigms 
of the reforms in the direction of strengthening the role of the 
state. 
  I hope that specialists on questions of taxes and finances 
will make recommendations for solving this problem. Let me note 
in passing that Novosibirsk mathematicians have developed a 
highly effective and precise algorithm that makes it possible to 
find on the spot and calculate sequences of mutual settlements 
for problems of practically any size and to optimize the 
directions and volumes of credit infusions according to the 
criterion of minimizing the bottlenecks in the payment system. 
  In the government's plan of actions special attention should 
be devoted to the creation of a social structure with a high 
buying power for the majority of the population and elimination 
of all privileges that are not the direct result of higher labor 
productivity. 
  Regarding questions of regional policy, it is impossible to 
bypass another subject that is painful to us--relations between 
the center and the region. Before perestroyka, when we were 
building a classless society and Moscow continued to build a 
model communist city, a rather lame joke was going around in 
Siberia: We have only one exploiter class in the country--the 
Muscovites. Everyone knew that the norms in Moscow were 
different, that there were more imports, and that their food 
products were better. But the differences were not egregious. 
According to statistical figures for February 1994, the level of 
monetary incomes of Novosibirsk residents lagged behind those of 
Muscovites by a factor of almost three. Moreover, according to 
estimates of experts of the Federation Council, such attributes 
of centralized power as federal taxes, the funds of branch 
ministries and departments, centralized nonbudget funds, and 
others brought about a concentration in Moscow of up to 80 
percent of the financial and credit resources of Russia. Under 
market conditions, when money is of decisive significance for 
society, this kind of centralization, in my view, is worse than 
the administrative-command system. If one looks at such an 
important indicator as average budget support per one resident, 
it turns out that here too the people of Novosibirsk are being 
treated unfairly today. According to figures for 1993, this 
indicator amounted to 70 percent of the average federal level 
and 46 percent of the average for Western Siberia. 
  Much needs to be changed here. For example, it is not 
permissible to have a single minimum wage for all of Russia when 
we have an imperfect system of regional coefficients that 
developed under conditions of a centralized economy. Taking 
advantage of Sergey Mikhaylovich Shakhray's presence here, I 
would ask the government to revisit the question of raising the 
regional coefficient to wages in Novosibirsk Oblast and the 
mechanism for financing costs of enterprises and organizations 
that are linked to this. 
  Another example: The formation of territorial budgets and 
their relations to the federal budget, and also the Central Bank 
of Russia. So much has already been said about the harm caused 
by granting all kinds of benefits and privileges out of 
subjective motives or national indicators. Why are certain 
regions exempt from taxes and receive certain exclusive rights 
while others do not receive these rights and are not exempt from 
taxes? I would not ask this question if this kind of 
redistribution had been done openly and on a scientific basis as 
it is in civilized countries. But this is not the case. And 
seeing the draft budget for 1994 convinces us of this once 
again. At the same time the president in his speech in the 
Federal Assembly named "overcoming the obvious unfairness in 
benefits and privileges to the regions" as the task of the year. 
We support the government's intentions to establish standard 
principles for budget relations in Russia and to conduct a 
clear-cut and, I emphasize, open budget policy. In our view, 
this would contribute to strengthening the unity of Russia more 
than the most brilliant verbal declarations. 
  Unfortunately, an analysis done on the basis of new 
approaches to the draft of the budget of the Russian Federation 
shows that the system of budget transfers adjusted by a fairly 
arbitrary subsidy to the regions that are called "especially 
needy," taking into account differences in volumes of 
centralized financing and capital investments, again leads us to 
the old results. What kind of equalization of conditions can 
there be if only additional subsidies to certain neighboring 
territories which are "especially needy" are sometimes 
comparable to the overall volume of revenues planned for the 
budget of Novosibirsk Oblast, including the notorious transfers. 
  A couple of words about the problem of differentiation of 
incomes. I have just spoken about territorial differences. But 
interbranch differences in wages and incomes inside each oblast 
are even greater. Finally, within an individual firm or 
department there can be an immense, sometimes 10-fold difference 
in wages. The detonator for the social explosion could be a 
situation whereby in one village a milkmaid receives 8,000, a 
postman--60,000, and a worker in a tax institution--200,000, 
where a cleaning lady in a commercial bank earns more than an 
academician with a name recognized throughout the world. We are 
moving from one extreme--the idea of universal equality and 
brotherhood--to the other--glaring inequality. But this extreme 
is much more dangerous and immoral. 
  The implementation of many of the tasks set in my report and 
others will require coordination of efforts of the center and 
the regions in carrying out state policy in all spheres of the 
life of society. In this connection during the period of 
preparation for the conference there arose the idea of creating 
in Novosibirsk a regional center for supporting Russian 
statehood and developing it. It is suggested that this center in 
the process of its activity would do prognosticatory-analytical 
research and development on draft laws under contracts with 
state organs at the federal and regional level and also through 
its own initiative. In order to clarify attitudes toward this 
and obtain your advice as to how best to organize the work of 
this center, a small questionnaire has been compiled and 
distributed among the participants. I hope that each participant 
in the conference will answer the questions on it, which will 
help us to correctly orient the activity of the center for 
support of Russian statehood. 
  The proposed approaches to the stabilization of the 
economies 
of the regions require qualified discussion and detailed 
development. I believe that this discussion could take place at 
this conference. Nor shall I conceal from you that the social 
commissions under the oblast administration, which include 
leading scholars, experienced businessmen and entrepreneurs, and 
workers of financial-credit institutions, has already developed 
a package of concrete proposals for anticrisis measures. We have 
studied the experience in implementing anticrisis measures in 
Ulyanovsk, Voronezh, and Nizhniynovgorod Oblasts and the state 
of affairs in the neighboring regions. We are waiting for 
proposals from our guests as well. But after discussion it is 
important to act on what is proposed. 
  Under the conditions of sharp socioeconomic fluctuations and 
chronic [word illegible] in federal legislation we in the oblast 
have arrived at the need to make maximum use of the rights 
granted by the new Constitution to components of the Federation 
in the area of norm setting. Based on the provisions of the new 
Constitution, the president's message, the experience of other 
regions, the Human Rights Declaration, and recommendations from 
the present conference, we shall begin to take extraordinary 
anticrisis measures on the territory of Novosibirsk Oblast. The 
measures we shall introduce shall envision: 
  --state regulation of prices and rates for products of 
monopolists; 
  --improvement of the system of taxation in the direction of 
increasing the buying power of the oblast's population; 
encouragement of the production of necessary goods; preservation 
of effective jobs; 
  --a complex of measures for combating commodity and monetary 
circulation that is not accounted for; 
  --commodity quality control, especially of foodstuffs, aimed 
at all-around support for the consumers; 
  --active support for the agro-industrial complex; 
  --regulation of the wage level in the direction of 
eliminating unjustified distortions, exercise of the citizens' 
right to equal pay for equal work as envisioned by the Human 
Rights Declaration and Russian legislation, the fight against 
unearned incomes, and other measures as well. 
  Of course it is impossible to come up with a radical 
solution 
to these problems in an individual area without state support. 
Therefore we are waiting for the comprehensive government 
commission which Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin promised to 
send us. The goals we are setting in our own anticrisis program 
are aimed at stable development of the territory, they are 
clear, and they should gain support. Our program envisions that 
each person, young or old, each worker, in the rural areas or 
the cities, each student, graduate student, scholar, artist, 
painter, entrepreneur, hired worker, physician, teacher, and 
others will finally receive what every person deserves--the 
right and the chance to live in a worthy way, like a human being. 
  And this is not a slogan. We are proceeding from a key 
provision of Article 18 of the Constitution of Russia to the 
effect that the rights and freedoms of the human being and 
citizen are immediately applicable and determine the meaning, 
content, and application of the laws as well as the activity of 
the legislative and executive powers.

<F P=106> [Speech by V. Koptyug: "Attempts To Resolve the Question in </F>
Parts Is Doomed to Failure (Speech at the Scientific-Practical 
Conference `Strategy of Stabilization of the Economy of the 
Region: Problems and Resolutions'"] 
  [Text] A feverish search is going on today at the level of 
state and territorial structures for extricating industries and 
territorial multibranch complexes out of the profound crisis in 
which they find themselves. Programs are being considered and 
formed on how to stop the slump and to restore the most 
important spheres of the economy of Russia (the fuel-energy 
sphere, enterprises of the military-industrial complex, the 
agro-industrial sector, the municipal economy, etc.) and its 
regions, krays, and oblasts. These programs are being lobbied by 
representatives of industries and territories in the Federal 
Assembly, in the Russian Federation Government, and on the 
president's staff. In the process, someone succeeds in 
extracting something, but the situation, on the whole, is only 
getting worse. 
  To do justice to the significance of today's conference on 
problems of the development of Novosibirsk Oblast and the 
efforts of the Siberian Accord interregional association 
throughout Siberia in general, which is important for the 
future, I would like to note immediately that the efforts to 
resolve the question in parts are doomed to failure. The 
question of "how to survive" can be resolved in part, but it is 
impossible to find an answer to the question of "how to live and 
develop?" 
  If we go along with the "reforms" conducted in recent years, 
if fundamental changes are not introduced in the strategy of 
socio-economic transformations in the country, then it simply 
would be daydreaming to count on the fact that, with the help of 
industrial and territorial programs, we will succeed in averting 
a further drop into the abyss of a crisis and in improving the 
situation in the regions. 
  Why? Let us analyze it. 
  The pivotal point of the reforms being conducted in our 
country is the attempt to introduce comprehensive market 
relations and private property across the board, even on the 
land on which we all live and feed ourselves. To expect that the 
market and general privatization in property will themselves 
regulate everything is ridiculous. Russians have already felt 
the full impact on themselves of just what a "wild market" is, 
but a civilized market is built over decades. It is impossible 
to build a civilized, regulated system of market relations in 
500 or 1,000 days. And this must be clearly understood. The 
country is reaping the fruit today of the "revolutionary" effort 
to join the market. 
  Why do I think that today's attempts to resolve the problem 
in parts is hopeless? First of all, because the country at all 
levels of management--state, branches of industry, and 
local--was deprived of the basic part of investment resources. 
And the matter here is by no means only in the catastrophic 
slump in the volumes of production, although there was no such 
production crisis in the entire history of the development of 
industrial countries in peacetime. The sharp slump in production 
is not so much a reason as a consequence. The consequence of the 
kind of policy that was conducted in Russia during the last two 
years. 
  What then do we have as a result of the clumsy reformation? 
  The introduction of elements of the market system were 
absolutely correctly reasoned as a need to arouse the initiative 
of the people, and with the help of entrepreneurial structures 
to ensure a rise in the output of products for the spheres of 
consumption and production. But for this, the levers of state 
stimulation of private-entrepreneurial production should be 
engaged, not even to mention the state sector. Did the state 
guarantee this? No. Although the support and protection of the 
domestic producer is the sacred obligation of the state and of 
those who formulate policy. 
  Today, as a result of the disproportion of prices for raw 
materials, energy, transport, and industrial articles, and the 
incredibly high credit interest, to produce something in the 
overwhelming majority of production sectors means to operate at 
a financial loss. What kind of an entrepreneur will begin to do 
this? It is precisely for this reason that the entrepreneurial 
structures in Russia went mainly (by 90 percent) along the path 
of trade, and, more specifically, speculation. Playing on the 
already mentioned price disproportions, they are amassing 
enormous capital that is not invested in domestic production, 
but is exported abroad. The accumulation of capital in the 
countries to which capital is exported makes it possible to 
lower credit rates there and thereby expand investment in 
production. It is embarrassing for me to call things by their 
name. Ask Western economists how they would characterize the 
actions of their government, if they would permit a similar 
situation. In the system of market relations, the principle of 
"self comes first" works especially distinctly. But so that the 
concept of "self" include not only personal, but also national 
interest, developed countries have built a very tough system of 
regulators and limiters. 
  But how much capital "flows away" abroad? According to the 
estimates of the experts, about $30 billion have been exported, 
and about $1.5 billion are exported monthly at the present time. 
This is an enormous blow against the economy of Russia. 
  Judge for yourself. An attempt is being made to draw up the 
state budget of Russia for 1994, which is being discussed at the 
present time, with an increase in expenditures over incomes by 
approximately 10 percent, or, in a monetary expression, by 60 
trillion rubles [R], which is equivalent to $33 billion, and the 
annual export of capital is valued at the present time at $18 
billion; i.e., more than half the budget deficit. According to 
official data, $15.5 billion out of the $48 billion value of 
exports did not return to Russia. But through channels that are 
not monitored? 
  In similar situations, civilized countries conduct strict 
control over the export of capital in order to force it, with 
the help of economic and legislative measures, "to work" in 
their own country. 
  While not undertaking the necessary measures in this 
direction, Russia at the same time is trying to cover the 
chronic deficit of the state budget at the expense of foreign 
loans. But, first, two-thirds of foreign credits usually remain 
in the crediting countries to support the production of that 
product (be it grain, industrial articles, or technology) that 
is later delivered to Russia owing to the credits. Thus, we are 
once again stimulating the development of production and the 
creation of jobs most of all not in our own country, but among 
our neighbors, burdening our state budget with foreign debt 
interest payment obligations. Second, that third that does come 
to Russia disappears "in the sand," as a result of the chaos in 
the spheres of management and control. Third, the real sum of 
financial resources that came to our country during two years 
(1992-1993) because $15 billion in foreign credits amounted to 
$4 billion, which corresponds to the total export of capital for 
two and a half months. 
  No less a powerful blow to the economy of the country was 
delivered and is being delivered by the insane policy of 
privatization. I cannot call the privatization that is being 
conducted at government level anything other than a fantastic 
swindle. I will not talk about the enormous disorganizational 
role of this policy with respect to industry, agriculture, the 
municipal sphere, etc. I will dwell only on the financial side 
of the matter. What is a voucher from a financial standpoint? 
Nothing more than a small share of a monthly wage. Anatoliy 
Borisovich Chubays, at the beginning of the "division" of state 
property, gave assurances that every voucher is at least 
equivalent to a passenger car. But no matter how much you try, 
you will not succeed in finding a commercial structure that is 
ready to take a voucher in exchange for a passenger car or other 
motor vehicle. One voucher is nothing, but thousands and tens of 
thousands of vouchers in the same hands, this is considerable, 
inasmuch as they give the owner the right to acquire large 
property at a favorable price, and in this case the voucher can 
really be "converted" into a passenger car. 
  Did the people win as a result of voucherization? No. Did 
the 
state win from it? Also, no. I will explain why the last answer 
is also negative. Toward the beginning of 1994, somewhat more 
than half of the state enterprises in the country were 
privatized, principally small and average ones. Now, in order to 
complete the privatization program before the summer of 1994, 
the privatization of large enterprises is unfolding at an 
increased pace. The "revolutionary" nature of the pace and 
methods of privatization is akin to the "revolutionary nature" 
of the shock construction of the system of market relations. The 
privatization program allegedly pursued economic objectives, 
but, in fact, they were purely political. Now, these objectives 
are no longer concealed--to quickly create a class of large 
property owners who would not allow the policy of capitalization 
of the country to be stopped. And it must be said that the 
achievement of this objective is not far off. And perhaps it has 
already been achieved, which I will talk about below. 
  Did the state receive anything on an economic plane from the 
implementation of the privatization program? As an answer to 
this question, I will quote an excerpt from a March article of 
John Ross, an economic adviser to a group of Laborites of the 
British Parliament, which was published in DELOVOY MIR. 
  "...In order to understand what this means for state 
incomes, 
it is necessary simply to note that the privatization of one 
large steel foundry in Brazil--Usiminas--gave the state $1.17 
billion. In Mexico, the privatization of 950 enterprises (and in 
Russia by the start of 1994, 85,000 enterprises were 
privatized--V.K.) gave the state $23 billion. But, 
after all, both the Brazilian and Mexican enterprises are 
incomparably smaller than, for example, ZIL. Nevertheless, in 
Russia the income from privatization was practically zero in 
comparison with the value of the removed funds. 
  "The implementation of this program had an exclusively 
macroeconomic consequence. The squandering of state property 
made it qualitatively difficult to finance the budget deficit. 
Thus, this privatization program from the beginning deprived the 
country of income from property that belonged to it, and 
afterwards the possible profits from its potential sale. The 
indirect consequences of this policy, operating through the 
budget, will lead to a reduction of credits and, as a 
consequence, to the closing of enterprises. 
  "Unquestionably, it was not the Central Bank that was the 
biggest creator of the budget deficit in Russia, but the 
privatization committee." 
  Thus, the objective that was really pursued by the authors 
and implementers of "shock" methods of introducing the market 
system and privatization, and specifically, the formation of a 
class of large owners of capital and property, was achieved. 
According to official data, 10 percent of the most well-to-do 
people in Russia on the average have incomes that are 11-12 
times greater than 10 percent of the people who are least 
provided for. In a number of regions, this ratio is two to three 
times higher, and if the unaccounted for and concealed incomes 
are considered, it undoubtedly is even more. Such a 
disproportion cannot help but prompt social disruption. 
  For the reasons talked about above, the new class will not 
invest its capital in Russia's economy in the near future. Their 
prime task now is to take power into their own hands, real 
power, and not official, window-dressing power. The answer to 
the question "Can something still be done to stop the fall of 
Russia into the abyss?" depends on how far they have already 
moved ahead in this direction. 
  It is a difficult question. Judging by certain signs, they 
have moved ahead far. Remember, for example, how many times a 
resolute struggle was proclaimed against organized large-scale 
economic and physical crime and against that without which 
organized crime cannot exist--against corruption of the state 
apparatus--but it turns out in practice that despite the 
measures that are being proclaimed, these monstrous ulcers on 
the body of the country are only spreading. Not only is trade 
shifting to the control of criminal structures in increasingly 
greater measure, but also such very important spheres as the 
system of money circulation, foreign economic relations, and 
privatization. The state allows the swindlers in the sphere of 
business to collect enormous amounts of money from the 
population through fake banks and funds and to disappear with 
them without a trace. 
  But what is to be done, if some chances of saving the 
economy 
still exist? It follows from what was said above that the 
resolution of economic problems today lies most of all in the 
political sphere and in the sphere of government management. 
  The failure of the "shock therapy" policy in Russia is 
obvious. The consequences of this are very grave. It is 
necessary to admit this courageously and to display the will for 
a decisive correction in policy. This is required of both the 
leaders of the country and society. I will mention in this 
connection the winged phrase of Academician L.I. Abalkin: 
"Christ was crucified on the demand of the masses!" By whom and 
how such a demand of the masses is formed is another question. 
  I fully agree with the words the president of the Russian 
Federation uttered at an expanded meeting of the government at 
the beginning of March of this year: "A policy is required of 
the government today that is calculated to have promise. To 
reform the economy at any price is an erroneous slogan. The 
people can reject a reform that is too burdensome" (which, in 
fact, occurred in the elections to parliament of Russia in 
December of last year). "In the end, the government must 
realistically develop a structural-investment policy. There is 
no other way to stop the technological roll back of Russia's 
industry. Otherwise, we can lose what little we 
have--industries, retained personnel, technological and other 
positions on the world market, and a native intellectual 
potential." 
  Correct words, only they are pronounced with a big delay. If 
deeds follow words with just as much of a big delay, then it 
will already be late. 
  What steps have to be taken now to create the conditions for 
restoring production in Russia? The same ones spoken by that 
outstanding president of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, 
who was elected to this post at the beginning of the 1930's, 
when the country was rapidly plunged into the abyss of an 
economic crisis that resulted from "a wild market"--he 
introduced tough state regulation and began to ease it when the 
country was once again on its feet. Borrowing from the Country 
of the Soviets the experience of strategic planning and state 
regulation, after adapting it to the capitalistic system, he 
saved this system. 
  But over the course of three-quarters of a century, we have 
closed our eyes to the experience of the development of 
capitalist countries, ignoring the fact that state regulation 
can be implemented not only by the command method, for which we 
paid or plunged ourselves (or we were pushed) into another 
extreme, but by more effective economic methods. Perhaps, at 
least now, while sliding toward the abyss of a crisis, we will 
see clearly and we will borrow from the history of the United 
States the path suggested to them by our country for getting out 
of the crisis. But this requires the firm will of the leaders of 
the country and an understanding of their actions by the people. 
Persuasions according to the principle of Leopold the cat have 
little promise today. 
  In a speech at the expanded meeting of the government, the 
president of the Russian Federation, while characterizing the 
actions planned for 1994, declared: "I will begin by bringing 
order and strengthening state economic principles." It would be 
very nice, if this did not remain just a declaration. 
  If we are talking about a correction of the economic sphere 
as such, then one of the paramount questions here is the 
monstrous disproportions in prices, and the key elements are the 
prices in the fuel-energy complex and in transport. On the one 
hand, the fact that domestic prices for energy sources are below 
world prices leads to the current conditions of criminalizing 
the sphere of their removal to the foreign market and to an 
increase in the already mentioned accumulation of capital 
abroad. On the other hand, an increase in domestic prices for 
energy sources will result in an industry that is already 
collapsing without this and will increase the total amount of 
mutual nonpayments. 
  Let us imagine that the prices of energy sources will be 
increased to world prices. Inasmuch as the energy and material 
consumption of our industries, as a rule, is higher than in 
developed countries, and labor productivity is lower, the prices 
for the products of these industries will increase higher than 
world prices, and, given open national borders (with respect to 
foreign economic relations), this production will turn out to be 
noncompetitive not only in the foreign market, but in the 
domestic market as well. The consequences are obvious--industry 
and agriculture will be utterly ruined 
  Consequently, to raise domestic prices for energy sources to 
world level without erecting customs barriers for imports of key 
types of products is impermissible. But inasmuch as our 
industrial production should be brought onto the world 
market--otherwise we will always only sell raw materials and 
become a raw material appendage of the developed countries--then 
it is obvious that before industry is reconstructed and its 
indices approach those of the West, domestic prices for energy 
sources must be lower than world prices. 
  The level of favorable prices for energy sources should be 
tied strictly to a program of phased reduction of the specific 
(per unit of product) energy consumption of an enterprise. The 
wage fund of the workers of the enterprise should also be tied 
to this and other programs for increasing the efficiency of 
production. As long as the market mechanism is not working, the 
state is obliged to regulate the price of manpower; i.e., wages, 
at least in the main industries of the economy. But, today, the 
lack of coordination on wages in our country is unbelievable. 
  As for the fuel-energy complex, at least at first, it will 
have to be subsidized, while simultaneously cutting the Gordian 
knot of mutual nonpayments. 
  No less important for Siberia with its enormous territory is 
the level of the cost of transportation services. Expenditures 
on railroad transportation render many types of raw materials 
unsuitable for extraction, inasmuch as the processing complexes 
are usually located in other points of Siberia. Even without 
this, transportation costs greatly weaken cooperative relations. 
  And, finally, the last thing I want to talk about, while 
contemplating the future of the country. Knowledge will be and 
is already becoming the main capital in postindustrial society 
in the developed countries. The destruction at all levels of 
education, fundamental and applied science, and culture will 
deprive our country of the future. 
  Therefore, it is necessary to consider the plans of the 
economic development of Novosibirsk Oblast and Siberia, but only 
the nearest events can be predicted. As for long-term projects 
and programs, without resolution of the aforementioned global 
overall state problems, there is a great probability that they 
will turn into harebrained schemes. 
  Territorial efforts today must be combined and directed at 
changes in the strategy of socio-economic reorganizations. The 
details of the strategy can be argued, but its outline is 
generally apparent. There is a whole series of sensible 
documents and reports bearing on this question, and pertinent 
decisions must be made. The time is short. 
  The adoption of such decisions can really only be achieved 
by 
the united efforts of the regions. The attempts of certain 
territories to extract resources or benefits only for themselves 
will turn into losses for everyone. Siberia needs economic 
integration of the territories on the basis of resourceful, 
technological, and economic mutual replenishment of each, and 
not disintegration. There is a need for the collective defense 
of a worthy place and role of Siberia in the economy of the 
country. It will be sad and vexing if the "Siberian Agreement" 
does not fulfill the hopes placed on it. 
  On occasion, one hears reproaches of separatist tendencies 
directed at Siberians. I do not think that there are objective 
grounds for this. It seems to me that an understanding prevails 
in Siberia that a sensible combination of regional and national 
interests can be achieved only given the unconditional supremacy 
of the federal legislative authority and the simultaneous 
transfer of a significant part of executive authority functions 
to the localities with a guarantee of economic opportunities to 
fulfill these functions. At the same time, the general federal 
policy with respect to the regions should take into account 
their main features and the significance of their development of 
the country as a whole. 
  As for the predictions and recommendations for the economic 
development of Siberia and its territories, we presented them at 
the appropriate All-Russian conference in June of 1993. They 
will also be given with an amendment to the events of recent 
months in this congress in speeches of representatives of the 
Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences. 
  Without going into detail, I will say that the core of these 
recommendations is the position that it is precisely Siberia 
with its very rich resources, production, and scientific 
potential, and special territorial situation, that can play the 
"role of the locomotive" that will pull the country out of the 
crisis. This can be done by implementing the conditions 
mentioned above and by declaring Siberia a zone of strategic 
interests of Russia. 
  The alternative is that Siberia can become a zone of 
strategic interests of the United States. After all, fantastic 
ideas of purchasing Siberia from Russia for about $3 trillion, 
with the payment of this sum over 20 years, are already being 
nurtured; moreover, half with "payment in kind"; i.e., with the 
goods and services of the producers of the United States. The 
delirium of a madman? I would grade similar proposals precisely 
as delirium, but the fact is that the Western mass media only 
publishes "delirium," when there is a demand for it, and when it 
is necessary to sound out the opinion of those whom this might 
concern. This should be kept in mind when encountering similar 
delirious ideas.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuzmenkin: "The Council--New, the </F>
Chairman--Previous"] 
  [Text] Undoubtedly the central event of the first day 
of the first session of the Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of 
Deputies was the election of its chairman. 
  Some people saw this as a real theater with all the 
trimmings: the director, the actors, the intermission, and the 
buffet; some saw it as a political game; and some saw it as a 
real drama.... 
  In the morning 34 people's deputies approved the agenda, 
excluding from it the point about considering the oblast's 
socioeconomic situation at the session. It was reasonable to 
exclude this since the oblast administration had decided to 
revise the figures taking into account the results of the recent 
scientific-practical conference in Novosibirsk. The deputies 
also formed seven committees and immediately demonstrated their 
attitude by refusing to allow the leader of the chancellery, a 
deputy of the Federation Council, Aleksey Manannikov, or Olga 
Lesnevskaya to attend the session. After a brief but stormy 
discussion with the participation of the oblast procurator they 
agreed that the decisions would be adopted by the soviet based 
on the number of elected deputies--34. (Let us recall that there 
should be a total of 49 deputies in the oblast Council.) 
  After the recess the deputies elected the chairman and, in 
spite of expectations, (the people intended to go home by 1500), 
the elections dragged on. There were three people in the 
running: Anatoliy Sychev, Aleksandr Kiselnikov, and Pavel 
Isayev. The head of the former Soviet of People's Deputies noted 
that he could "consider himself a professional in this business" 
and discussed in detail the tasks of the new Soviet of Deputies 
(without the epithet "people's"). His major opponent was the 
well-known Novosibirsk economist-analyst A. Kiselnikov, who also 
discussed in detail his vision of the future work of the 
deputies. The third candidate, incidentally, a recent candidate 
to the State Duma, Pavel Isayev--a scholar from 
Akademgorodok--put himself in the running and defined his main 
task as to break down the image of Novosibirsk Oblast as "the 
most conservative and irreconcilable region." It was clear that 
the battle would be between the first two candidates. And that 
was the way it went: Sychev received 14 votes, Kiselnikov--six, 
and Isayev--three. But in order to become chairman it was 
necessary to gain the support of a minimum of 18 deputies. In 
the first round 11 deputies did not vote for anyone, and here is 
what is interesting: Among the deputies were 11 administration 
chiefs (Nikolay Krasnikov--the administration chief of Koltsov, 
representing Russia's Choice--was not counted).... 
  Thus began the theater or game or call it what you will. The 
VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK correspondent learned from reliable 
sources that the scenario became known in the morning, and this 
was brilliantly confirmed during the day. During the second 
round A. Sychev garnered 17 votes and A. Kiselnikov--11, and, in 
keeping with the election regulations, a new nomination was 
started. Aleksandr Kiselnikov withdrew his candidacy and it was 
suggested in a cheerful voice from the microphone that they 
elect a "rural person." That is what Nikolay Baraulin, 
Toguchinskiy Rayon administration chief, was. In his extremely 
brief speech he stated that he had already been elected 24 times 
and if they trusted him, he was ready. Precisely who "should" 
was not stated aloud, but everyone understood that now the 
aforementioned 11 people would express their opinion. Many 
deputies were disturbed about the "games" and deputy Plyushkin, 
a physician by profession, suggested that they give a lot of 
thought to what was going on in the hall and express their 
opinion anyway because "abstention was dangerous to the health." 
As a result, the people's elect took the doctor's advice and in 
the meantime, breaking the opponent's game, started playing 
their own. Anatoliy Sychev gathered 19 votes, and his 
opponent--only 13. 
  And so Anatoliy Pavlovich Sychev was elected chairman of the 
Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Nikolayeva: "How To Make Ecological </F>
Concerns a Business Subject"] 
  [Text] Between 15 April and 5 June, "Ecological 
Safety Days" are being held in Russia; our city and oblast are 
actively participating in this event. 
  In particular, the recently created public organization--the 
Ecological Equilibrium foundation--opened its first 
self-financing structure in April, the bureau of environmental 
evaluation, whose primary business will be putting together 
normative documents for enterprises regarding maximum allowed 
discharges into the atmosphere. They will do it in cooperation 
with the foundation's partner--the Logos scientific-industrial 
foundation. 
  The bureau plans to offer other types of evaluation as well. 
I would remind that the Ecological Equilibrium foundation 
presented itself to the public on 1 March, describing as its 
goal development of environmental business. This organization 
intends to turn money-losing ecology into a zone of profitable 
and stable business. The bureau will conduct independent 
evaluation and project appraisal and bring it to a "working" 
condition by bringing in a broad range of specialists, including 
economists. 
  The first business project the foundation is already working 
on will be waste utilization at the Kudryashevo swine-breeding 
complex--one of the four largest animal husbandry complexes in 
Russia. Liquid waste will be processed into a solid 
substance--organic fertilizer. Remarkably, this requires minimal 
equipment, while productivity is quite high--as high as the 
demand for organic fertilizer. 
  The next step earmarked for implementation this year is the 
creation of a minicomplex: a parking lot, a gas station offering 
a skeleton set of repair and maintenance, and a car wash. Of 
course, there are quite a few such facilities in the city, but 
none meets ecological safety standards. The new one, which is 
envisaged to be built in the Krasnoobsk area, will be fitted 
with a closed-loop purification system. This brings up a 
question: Why was it necessary to set up a public organization 
if the problems of ecological equilibrium are worked on one way 
or the other by state structures--the oblast and the city 
committees on ecology and natural resources. 
  "Briefly, I can answer it this way: State ecological 
organizations spend taxpayers money on liquidating the 
consequences of poor management. How successfully--you judge for 
yourself. Our foundation is trying to attract the public that is 
in some way or the other concerned over the unhealthy 
environment, earn money, and invest it in economically 
profitable projects and programs, in, as they say, `high 
technology,'" replies foundation President Oleg Nikolayevich 
Kolmakov. "At the same time, we work in close--one may say, 
brotherly--contact with the oblast and city committees."

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Overchuk: "Planned Crime. A Gangster for </F>
Every Militiaman!"] 
  [Text] The Moscow GUVD [City Internal Affairs 
Administration] has delivered a volley of paper against crime. 
Using secret orders and instructions in Petrovka they hope to 
win the war against crime. Previously the leaders explained in 
words who should catch how many gangsters. Now the GUVD has 
issued secret order No. 017. The local offices quickly adjusted. 
The militiaman had forgotten the number of criminals assigned to 
him, he went up to the board on which the orders were posted and 
looked. And there he saw, for example, order for the 
Southern Administrative District of the City of Moscow of 10 
March of this year signed by Major General of the Militia Ye. 
Rozhkov. It gives the sections the assignment of solving 
from one to three crimes each month, reporting on no less than 
two people who have been previously convicted, one drug addict, 
and so forth. 
  The roundup of the criminal brotherhood has been placed on a 
conveyor belt. 
  The operations workers laughed their heads off over these 
figures. The regional division for combating organized crime of 
the Southern District during the month ordered that six criminal 
groups be caught. They were to uncover seven crimes committed by 
the same criminal groups and uncover a total of 16 crimes. The 
main thing is that everything must go according to plan. They 
may catch more, but by no means fewer. If they do not fulfill 
the plan they will be docked half their salary. And if they 
catch more--there will be a reward. The plan will be increased. 
  The most terrible figures are for the workers of the state 
automotive inspection. The department of the GAI [State 
Automotive Inspection] and GPS [Patrol and Guard Service] must 
catch 72,532 drivers a month for traffic violations. The 
pedestrians got lucky. Fewer of them will be caught--20,723. 
  This plan deals a blow to us first of all. But it is easy to 
evade it. On the first days of each month try to stay home as 
much as possible. Let them catch the people who do not read our 
newspaper: They will help the militia fulfill their monthly plan.

<F P=106> [Interview with Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, by unidentified </F>
OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent under the rubric "You Talk--We 
Listen"; place and date not given: "The Mayor of Moscow Explains 
to Caucasus Natives Who Is Not Welcome in Moscow"] 
  [Text] Muscovites' relations with capital city 
visitors have not been very smooth lately. Especially visitors 
from the Caucasus. The Moscow militia is frequently accused of 
purposeful persecution of "persons of Caucasus origin," while 
rumor has it that the capital city authorities encourage these 
unlawful actions. Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov does care about the 
reputation of his city and the city authorities. Therefore he 
decided to visit the Republic of Dagestan in order to discuss at 
the point of origin the problem of relations between Muscovites 
and Caucasus natives. After the trip, Yuriy Mikhaylovich shared 
his impressions with a OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent. 
  [Luzhkov] When you have a problem, the best way is to go and 
study it "at the source." In the beginning of March four 
Dagestanis died in shoot outs here in Moscow. Some figures in 
Dagestan began to distort the causes of these people's deaths; a 
version began to circulate that they had died as a result of 
negligence on the part of authorities, and that in general 
Caucasus natives are treated badly in the capital city. 
  When I talked in Moscow with republic Supreme Soviet 
Chairman 
Magamedov and Ramazan Abdulatipov, they said that people need 
objective first-hand information. Then I decided to make a trip 
there and explain to Dagestanis what the situation in Moscow is, 
how we feel about citizens of this republic, whom we welcome, 
and whom we do not. 
  You may say that my visit was a complete success. We visited 
cities and villages; I gave an interview on television, in which 
I said that the main cause of crime is the dire economic state 
of the republic. They have to deal with the unemployment 
problem, use all production and natural resources to get rid of 
this trouble--mass unemployment. Because many people from the 
Caucasus go to Moscow and St. Petersburg and join criminal 
groups because of poor conditions at home. 
  People kept asking me about registration of persons of 
"Caucasus origin" in Moscow. I said: Dagestan is part of Russia; 
none of our decrees say anything about registering citizens of 
Russia, so this question is misdirected. Yes, we require that 
Chechens be registered, because Chechnya proclaimed itself an 
independent state. So let them register. As to what "a person of 
Caucasus origin" is, I do not know. I know the Caucasus; I know 
numerous nations that live in the Caucasus; they are all very 
different, very original, and you cannot measure them all with 
the same yardstick--this is absurd and illiterate. In my 
opinion, crime does not have a nationality. If 50 percent of the 
crimes in Moscow are committed by Russians, what do Dagestanis 
have to do with it? If 10 percent of the crimes are committed by 
Ukrainians, again, what do Dagestanis have to do with it? We do 
not divide crime by ethnic attributes. 
  Speaking of the situation in Moscow, the problem of 
interethnic relations has been resolved. I do not want to brag, 
but I can say that Moscow remains a city of ethnic diversity, 
where people live together peacefully, and we do not have 
serious ethnic conflicts. We are currently opening Korean, 
Georgian, Armenian, and Tatar schools in Moscow--to make things 
easier and more comfortable for people of other nationalities 
who live permanently in Moscow, so that they will not abandon 
their culture, their language. This is very important. 
  Together with me on the visit to Dagestan was Yuriy 
Tomashev, 
first deputy chief of the city administration of internal 
affairs [GUVD]; he brought additional information and handed it 
over to Dagestani internal affairs organs and leadership. And 
this problem got special emphasis in our joint protocol. We 
agreed that it is necessary to keep each other informed on the 
state of suppression of crime. Also that a representative of the 
Dagestani Ministry of Internal Affairs will be assigned either 
permanently or on an as-needed basis to work in the GUVD with 
members of the capital city militia. So now we will fight crime 
together, regardless of personalities and nationalities.

  The registration of transactions for purchase and sale of 
foreign currency completed in exchanges of Moscow which,

the fee. 
  In the event of a violation of this provision, the exchanges 
shall deposit into budget income the entire sum of the fee due 
for payment from the profit (income) remaining at their disposal 
after the payment of the profit tax. 
  Exchanges located in the city of Moscow at which 
transactions 
for the purchase and sale of foreign currency are completed 
must, by the deadline set for submitting the bookkeeping report,

foreign currency are completed shall calculate and pay the fee 
according to the procedure and by the deadlines established by 
the State Tax Inspection for Moscow in coordination with the 
Department of Finance of the Government of Moscow. 
  The fee on transactions for purchase and sale of foreign 
currency concluded at exchanges of Moscow shall be transferred 
into budget income in keeping with existing legislation.

fixed capital are concluded shall bear responsibility for the 
completeness of the deduction and the promptness of the transfer 
to the budget of fees on said transactions in keeping with the 
Russian Federation law "On Fundamentals of the Tax System in the 
Russian Federation" and the present law. 
  Monitoring of the correctness of the calculation and 
promptness of the transfer of the fee shall be provided by tax 
organs in keeping with Russian Federation Law No. 943-1, dated

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "A New TES [steam electric power </F>
plant] Will Be Built in St. Petersburg"] 
  [Text] Russia and Finland are conducting negotiations on 
the construction of a gigantic electric power plant in 
northwestern St. Petersburg. 
  The plant has been designed by a consortium of three Finnish 
firms: Ematran Voima, Polar and Siemens. Pile driving work is 
now going on at the site. The plant's first power bloc of 450 
milliwatts will be ready at the end of 1996 and the second 
should come on line two years later. Then the Russian side will 
build two analagous blocs with its own resources. The Russians 
will be able to pay for delivery of western equipment with 
electric power which will be delivered to Finland for a sum of 
two billion Finnmarks. 
  St. Petersburg's power system requires 30 percent repair in 
the coming years. Two blocs of the Sosnovyy Bor nuclear power 
plant will be shut down in the year 2000. St. Petersburg is 
competely supplied with electric power but there is not enough 
for heating. Construction of a steam electric power plant for 
the expanding northwestern region of the city will be a rational 
solution to this problem.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov, </F>
conducted by Yelena Dikun: "He Who Has Understood Life Does Not 
Hurry to Moscow"] 
  [Text] According to the results of the rating polls, 
Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov is regularly among the 
hundred most influential politicians in Russia. This is the 
second year that he has been included in the "who's who" of 
promising young leaders who will determine world policy in the 
next century. Does Mr. Nemtsov not feel cramped in his one 
individual province? Is he not being pulled closer to the 
Kremlin? 
  [Nemtsov] No, I say without any coyness: I want to be a 
governor. I have started an undertaking, maybe with some 
mistakes (I do not know if they are from youth or from 
stupidity), but some things have begun to work out. And now it 
would be madness to drop everything and move to Moscow. I do not 
exclude the possibility that in the future, but not very soon, I 
will be able to work in the government. However, I do not intend 
to participate in the presidential elections--neither in the 
upcoming ones, nor in the ones after that. 
  [Correspondent] The things that have "begun to work out" in 
Nizhegorodskiy Oblast, are they very difficult to superimpose 
onto an all-Russian scope? 
  [Nemtsov] The main all-Russian problem is the declining 
economy. The orthodox methods--to stop giving credits to 
everyone, to limit expenditures by any means, even if it is at 
the price of impoverishing the people--are unacceptable to 
Russia. It would be more correct to isolate specific promising 
sectors and to implement a rather harsh structural policy. 
Moreover, the criterion of promise should be determined not by 
whether some bureaucrat likes a certain sphere, but by where 
private capital is going, where the people are investing their 
own money. Since this is associated with a great deal of risk 
and is done very cautiously, then, as a rule, this is an almost 
unerring choice. And the state has merely to support it from its 
own side. In this regard it plays a secondary role. If, for 
instance, today private capital is going for the development of 
service and to trade, then the state must also direct its money 
there. If private capital goes, for example, to construction, 
and a construction boom is becoming clearly outlined now, then 
state money should follow. 
  For example, the processing of agricultural production is 
very profitable. Last year we supported entrepreneurs, including 
also kolkhoz [collective farm] farmers who wanted to build 
private mills and sausage-making shops, to organize the 
production of cheese, yogurt, etc. There were 123 processing 
plants built with "mixed" money. As a result, we were able to 
kill three birds with one stone: We increased the profitability 
of agriculture, saturated the market, and broke up the monopoly 
of the processing sector. 
  Or here is another example. This year, conversion credit 
will 
be granted only to those enterprises which have found the funds 
for investment in their own production, either in domestic or in 
Western banks. In short, I look to see where the large banks are 
"diving." I find out what investment programs they have and, if 
there is a little money in the oblast treasury, I try to get it 
into the promising projects. 
  The second thing that may be imitated from us is the method 
of "tying up" the free public funds. The idea, which Yavlinskiy 
and I worked out in Nizhniy Novgorod, consists of issuing loans 
which are rather attractive to the citizens, and using the money 
obtained from the public for capital investments. At one time, 
loans uplifted the economy of Japan. On one hand, this is a 
struggle with inflation, since the "hot" money goes out of 
circulation, and on the other--it is an organization of 
investments. Unfortunately, it is difficult to offer loans on a 
federal level, since the population does not trust the 
government. But at the local level, judging by what is happening 
here in Nizhniy, this is still possible. The "Yavlinskiy loan," 
for example, was snapped up literally in a few months. Recently 
we offered a telephone loan. The citizens receive a certificate 
which guarantees them the installation of a telephone within 
half a year. For every overdue day, the telephone network must 
pay one percent. Therefore, naturally, we are interested in 
building the telephone station as soon as possible. Today we are 
trying to implement a housing loan. 
  [Correspondent] Your oblast is always being cited as an 
example. You are constantly being visited by high-level guests 
and government delegations. This is reminiscent of the model 
kolkhoz or plant which formerly served the leadership as a 
propaganda aid. 
  [Nemtsov] The only difference is that no one gives us money 
for "leading experience." We do not have any privileges as 
compared with others. In fact, everything depends on the 
political will of the governor: If he wants to do something, he 
does it. If he does not want to--he does not. As for the 
attention of well-known people, that is not a bad thing at all. 
First of all, we ourselves receive a certain stimulus. Secondly, 
often our experience becomes the property of all Russia, and 
sometimes even the CIS countries. And finally, such a situation 
is advantageous to me as governor. It is much better than having 
the image of a man who is constantly displeased with Moscow. 
  [Correspondent] You do not like to quarrel with the 
leadership, or is there no need for this? 
  [Nemtsov] I simply try not to conduct myself in a 
challenging 
manner. The concern for the interests of the region force the 
governor to be a pragmatist. If I am unhappy about something, if 
I feel that personal relations are starting to get in the way of 
the cause, I will express this in a personal conversation, and 
not in a newspaper interview. As long as I live in Nizhniy 
Novgorod and do not get involved in the Moscow shuffle, I will 
have normal relations both with the Kremlin, and with the 
government, and with parliament. But if I suddenly got the 
desire to engage in politics in Moscow, I believe that a number 
of conflicts with all the institutions of power would arise 
immediately. 
  Yet for now, when I need the support of the president or the 
prime minister, I get it. But I turn to them only in the most 
extreme cases. For example, when the government wanted to stop 
the privatization of cargo transport. At that time, we sold 
trucks at open auctions and created a very strong sector in this 
sphere, which resolved the problem of supplying the city with 
milk, bread, petroleum products, etc. But the Ministry of 
Transport offered very strong resistance. I had to go to 
Yeltsin, and the problem was solved in about 15 seconds. While I 
was there, Boris Nikolayevich called the transport authorities 
and said: "If you impede the governor, you will deal with me." 
Recently I had a conflict with the mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod. It 
was necessary to remove him, since he was impossible to work 
with. 
  [Correspondent] A strange story. After all, you and Mayor 
Bednyakov were of the same mind, almost friends. What happened? 
  [Nemtsov] It is a very simple story. If a person brings to 
referendum the question of city sovereignty, if his main goal is 
to bring to the point of absurdity the idea of separating the 
city from the oblast, then I believe that it is impossible to 
work with such a mayor. Because this is a direct threat to the 
entire system of power which is rather fragile, and which may 
lead to anarchy. I cannot work under conditions of conflict. In 
this, evidently, I differ from many Moscow leaders, who cannot 
imagine themselves under any other conditions. I need if not 
mutual understanding, then at least a tolerant attitude toward 
one another. Otherwise, nothing will get accomplished. Let us 
take land reform: If the leadership holds noisy discussions on 
this topic, public clarification of attitudes, then the cautious 
peasants will never in their life follow the reformers. 
  Unfortunately, it has worked out in these two-and-a-half 
years that the mayor and I had no mutual understanding, and 
especially no tolerance in our relations. Maybe I too am at 
fault in this. We began in the era of romanticism. Everyone 
greeted us: "Go ahead and work, you boys from Nizhniy Novgorod, 
and we will support you." Then the paradise apples ended, and a 
mass of problems arose: There is no money, the plants are 
stopping work, there is growing public discontent, and the 
prestige of authority is falling. When we go uphill, we must 
help each other. But sometimes one thinks that he can get to the 
top first, leaving all the others behind. And then the struggle 
for personal precedence begins. Then I suggested to Boris 
Nikolayevich that he remove Bednyakov from his duties. He had 
appointed him, and he removed him. Bednyakov is a civil servant, 
just like me. The only thing that distinguishes me from a civil 
servant is that I have been popularly elected, receiving 70 
percent of the votes. 
  [Correspondent] Do you have any opposition in Nizhniy 
Novgorod, and does it hinder you in your work? 
  [Nemtsov] There is, and it is rather powerful: The 
communists 
from "Trudovaya Rossiya," the national-patriots and the 
radicals. However, they lost in the local elections. I cannot 
say that the opposition hinders the reforms. However, it keeps 
us from napping, all the time trying to find mistakes and 
pointing them out most persistently. In that sense, the 
existence of the "street" opposition is even beneficial--it 
forces us to keep our form.
