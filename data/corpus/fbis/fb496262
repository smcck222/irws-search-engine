<F P=106> [Interview with Pavel Borodin, administrator of affairs of </F>
the president of the Russian Federation, by Andrey Uglanov: 
"Ministers Come and Go, but the Administrative Machinery 
Remains"] 
  [Text] State machinery is eternal. Without it--there 
is anarchy and chaos. The ministers, deputies, and the thousands 
of people who stand behind them need housing, communications, 
and the organization of rest. Our interlocutor is Pavel Borodin, 
administrator of affairs of the president of the Russian 
Federation. 
  [Uglanov] Pavel Pavlovich, what is the secret of your very 
rapid career--from Yakutia to Moscow, and immediately to the 
Kremlin? 
  [Borodin] I am an economist by education. I did not engage 
in 
party work. I spent the last five years as mayor of Yakutsk. I 
did not write slogans, I worked. In 1990 Boris Yeltsin flew to 
Yakutsk during the harshest season: December, the temperature 
was minus 57 degrees centigrade, and the aircraft barely landed. 
He looked at how the economy of the city was being run under 
these very difficult conditions. Apparently, he remembered what 
he saw. Last year I received an invitation to Moscow. I did not 
refuse. 
  [Uglanov] You were a people's deputy of the Russian 
Federation. Do you have any nostalgic feelings for those times? 
  [Borodin] It is impossible simply to up and severely 
criticize everything that was done by us. We legislatively 
turned the economy toward the market, and we introduced the 
institution of the president in Russia. At the same time, I 
cannot say that our successors got rid of all the defects of the 
preceding convocation. As for nostalgia, three years as a deputy 
contained so many events that they will never leave my memory. 
  [Uglanov] Just what are the presidential services? How and 
with what is the numerous retinue provided? 
  [Borodin] Even though we are called the administration of 
affairs of the president of the Russian Federation, we are more 
like a federal service that supports the vital activity of all 
the higher federal organs of authority. I have in mind the staff 
of the president, the government apparatus, the staff of the 
Federation Council and the State Duma, and the apparatus of all 
the courts: the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court, and Court 
of Arbitration. It is maintenance of buildings, reconstruction, 
technical reequipping, motor vehicle service, rest, and hotel 
management. There are more than 30,000 workers and 75 
enterprises in the administration of affairs. These are 
government buildings, the Kremlin, hotels, truck farms, rest 
homes, tailoring establishments, and shoe repair shops. That is, 
a state within a state. 
  [Uglanov] The circle is closed? Previously there was an 
administration of affairs of the CPSU Central Committee. It was 
also responsible for everything. 
  [Borodin] We combined the administration of affairs of the 
CPSU Central Committee, the USSR Supreme Soviet, the USSR 
Council of Ministers, the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, and the 
RSFSR Council of Ministers. The number of chiefs was reduced by 
a factor of exactly five. Practically all the workers remained. 
It was very difficult to retain top professionals at a wage of 
10-15,000 rubles [R]. But now we have been authorized to support 
our own budget owing to commercial activity. All summer home 
operations have been removed from the state budget and are on 
self-financing. The same goes for hotels. 
  [Uglanov] You are a high-ranking civil servant. Many think 
that indispensable attributes of a civil servant are a big 
chair, a beautiful secretary, and long negotiations behind a 
lavish table with drinks. 
  [Borodin] I essentially have a nonstandard workday. In a 
year's work here I had only a couple of free Sundays. I have a 
car telephone, a summer home telephone, and a home telephone. I 
can be called and contacted everywhere. There is work, work... I 
have been in this position a year, and I would like to say 
several good words to the workers of the administration of 
affairs and support those civil servants with whom we work. 
  [Uglanov] There is a visible side of the life of a civil 
servant. But there is also an invisible side, which in our 
consciousness is associated with some kind of pleasures that are 
not accessible to everyone. 
  [Borodin] He does not receive pleasures very often, and not 
very much. The average wage is R150-200,000. The very highest, 
of course, even get R700,000. Civil servants of higher rank get 
personal summer homes. I have in mind ministers and chiefs of 
main administrations. 
  [Uglanov] Summer homes with cooks? 
  [Borodin] There is a law which was adopted by the former 
Supreme Soviet. Only guarded persons are provided cooks. There 
are about 20 such persons today. They have both cooks and guards. 
  [Uglanov] Are these summer homes being privatized. 
  [Borodin] No. According to an edict of the president, the 
privatization of state summer homes is categorically prohibited. 
  There is a second category of senior civil servants, of 
which 
there are about 150. They have summer homes year round. There 
are also those who get summer homes only for the summer season. 
There are approximately 200 of these persons. We rent some of 
the summer homes to commercial structures: Resources are needed 
to maintain this operation. Moreover, the civil servants and 
businessmen live separately. There is a system of rest homes for 
Saturdays and Sundays. 
  [Uglanov] When the Politburo was located here, people were 
invited to work in Moscow, frequently through political 
influence. They were given elegant apartments. How is your 
practice different? 
  [Borodin] We are now doing our own construction, on the 
order 
of 200-300 apartments a year. We also have an agreement with the 
Government of Moscow about acquiring another 500 apartments in a 
year. A tough procedure for their allocation has been 
established. If we invite ministers or first deputy ministers to 
Moscow, they receive a right of permanent residence without a 
license. If a rank lower, the inviting structure pays for the 
license, Very few prestigious apartments are being built. 
Ordinary prefabricated houses. 
  [Uglanov] As far as I can recall, every ruler who comes to 
power in Russia tries to build himself a residence. And Boris 
Nikolayevich? 
  [Borodin] He has a number of suburban residences. All of 
this 
corresponds to diplomatic protocol. Everything remains that 
there was before. No new residences are being built or financed. 
There are many rumors. But I work on this matter directly. He 
leads the life of an ordinary person. 
  [Uglanov] The Soviet Union had significant property abroad. 
There were rumors that there are islands in the Aegean Sea that 
were given to Russian tsars at one time. 
  [Borodin] This is a very difficult question. There are no 
intergovernmental agreements. What was in Ukraine became 
Ukrainian, and what was in the Baltics became Baltic. 
  [Uglanov] That is all the Crimean residences of the Russian 
emperors... 
  [Borodin] Yes. They are going to ruin, because they require 
proper capital investments. They have to be reconstructed, and 
it is necessary to manage them. It is generally a paradox: It is 
better to let them go to ruin, to collapse, but not to give them 
to anyone. 
  [Uglanov] Do you have any contacts with your colleagues in 
Ukraine? 
  [Borodin] We are attempting to prepare a number of 
intergovernmental agreements. With both Ukraine and the Baltics. 
But everything is getting bogged down. 
  [Uglanov] You are an experienced executive. Do you sense 
that 
it is already possible to work in Russia, or do you use the 
"sovereign's knout?" 
  [Borodin] As for the sovereign's knout, this is absolutely 
not the case. We want to work in a rule-of-law, economic space 
of Russia, and only according to its laws. 
  Some regulating laws, edicts, and statutes are necessary. 
There are many complicated problems. But today we have the kind 
of society in which people who are able to work feel like a fish 
in water. There are difficulties outside the borders of the 
Russian Federation. But inside, any problem can be resolved, if 
you are able to work. Specialists have already grown up in the 
banking business, in construction, in trade; moreover, they are 
young men. Today, heads decide everything. And there is an 
infinite number of proposals.

<F P=106> [Interview with State Duma Deputy Anatoliy Lukyanov by </F>
Nikolay Leontyev; place and date not given: "A Slow-Moving Civil 
War Is Under Way"] 
  [Text] A. Lukyanov is in no need of any special 
introduction. He became particularly well known as chairman of 
the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and as M. Gorbachev's perestroyka 
associate. A former leader of the disintegrated CPSU, he is now 
a deputy of the State Duma from the slate of the new communist 
party--the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. 
  [Leontyev] Anatoliy Ivanovich, how do you evaluate the 
Duma's 
work? 
  [Lukyanov] The State Duma and the Federal Assembly as a 
whole 
have sensed quite rapidly that they cannot linger over 
organizational matters and must embark as quickly as possible on 
a resolution of the problems which are troubling the people. 
This process has begun, it is moving quite actively. The Duma 
has also taken up questions of payment of the arrears to the 
peasantry and the structural reorganization of industry and 
national problems and questions of protection of research and 
the child and many international problems. So all this is taking 
place. But at the same time I understand full well that the 
powers of the Duma and the Federation Council are very, very 
limited. They cannot tackle much by virtue of the constitution 
that was adopted by only one-third of the population of the 
country and that was foisted on our society. I cannot yet say, 
therefore, that there will be big results from the Duma's work. 
  [Leontyev] With which factions are you prepared to 
cooperate? 
  [Lukyanov] I am a member of the Russia's Way group of 
deputies, and we are prepared to cooperate with any faction in 
the Duma that defends Russia's interests and contributes to at 
least some slowing of the country's decline into the abyss of 
crisis. 
  [Leontyev] Is the formation of a bloc of all patriotic 
forces 
possible? 
  [Lukyanov] Such a bloc has already been formed. It is called 
Accord in the Name of Russia. It includes the Agrarians, the 
Communists, and leading figures of the Democratic Party, the 
Free Russia People's Party, and the Russian National Union, that 
is, of the most important public associations. In terms of 
numbers the bloc is superior to all other associations put 
together. This is a hand proffered the president. 
  [Leontyev] What is your attitude toward Zhirinovskiy's 
party? 
  [Lukyanov] One of composure. I believe that V.V. 
Zhirinovskiy's party is very diverse in terms of its composition 
and the positions of the people who are members of it. To take 
the program principles of this party, they largely coincide with 
the program principles of Russia's Choice. For example, V.V. 
Zhirinovskiy and Russia's Choice concertedly support this 
constitution, while the parties of the left, the communists 
included, are opposed. Zhirinovskiy and Russia's Choice are for 
stringent and strong presidential power. Many communists are 
altogether opposed to the institution of a presidency in Russia. 
In their view, it corresponds neither to our mentality nor to 
our traditions. The LDPR, like Russia's Choice also, agreed, on 
the whole, to the exclusion from the constitution of the term 
"sovereignty" as applied to the components of the Federation. 
Zhirinovskiy altogether proposes that Russia be divided into 
provinces. The communists, like the Russia's Way group also, 
have a more balanced position. 
  [Leontyev] Do the terms "province" and "oblast" really have 
a 
different semantic content? 
  [Lukyanov] It is not a question of the name but of the fact 
that Russia should not have national-territorial division. 
  [Leontyev] Perhaps this would lessen the interethnic 
discord, 
and the peoples would cease their disputes as to whom this 
territory or the other belongs? 
  [Lukyanov] It is a complex issue. Entirely different forms 
became a part of Russia: the Bukhara Emirate and the Khiva 
Khanate, the parliamentary Republic of Finland and the Kingdom 
of Poland, Estland, in which serfdom was abolished almost 50 
years earlier than it was in Russia, and others. Entirely 
different components, but they were formed with regard to the 
national composition of the population. There were the Turkestan 
and Transcaucasus governorships general.... Account had to be 
taken of the nationality factor after October 1917 also, 
otherwise the country would have fallen apart. The concentration 
of production, integration, and the economy as a whole would, in 
principle, develop better were there simply 
administrative-territorial division with the existence in a 
number of places of national-cultural autonomy. But such are the 
specific features of Russia. And it is not a question of names 
here, it is simply necessary to take account of the social and 
economic features of the country and its national composition: 
More than 130 nations and national groups live here. 
  [Leontyev] And if each national group conceives a desire for 
its own statehood, will this not signify a constant struggle for 
a recarving of borders and interminable conflicts? 
  [Lukyanov] There was none of this in the Soviet Union. A 
certain consensus was found. Saying that the national-state 
division of the country inevitably causes conflicts is, from my 
viewpoint, improper. There could be conflicts in certain cases. 
But there are political and other solutions also. 
  [Leontyev] How do you evaluate the present situation in the 
country? 
  [Lukyanov] Extraordinarily complex. A slow-moving civil war 
is under way, in the outlying areas particularly. We are 
undergoing several revolutions simultaneously: geopolitical, 
which has cast Russia to the back of beyond, and social, when 5 
percent of the wealthiest strata of society has emerged and more 
than 35 percent are on the verge destitution and when Western 
individualist and egotistic aspirituality has been foisted on 
society. It will be extraordinarily difficult to find general 
agreement in this division: There is social discord in society, 
and the president, with his statement concerning the need for 
social accord and civil peace, may be heard by far from 
everyone. Qualitative changes in policy and the abandonment of 
shock therapy are essential for such peace to be lasting and 
stable. 
  [Leontyev] How do you evaluate the personality and activity 
of the president? 
  [Lukyanov] I have known him as an individual for a long 
time. 
As far as the president's activity is concerned, its essence 
consists to a considerable extent of the pursuit of a policy 
which expresses the interests of the "new Russians" who are 
coming to power in coalescence with mafia circles and orienting 
themselves toward Western capital. But I do not believe that it 
will be that simple to impose the ideas and practice of 
capitalization: Russian conciliarism, spirituality, community 
living, and collectivism are too deeply ingrained in us. I am 
sure that neither American jeans nor European sleeveless jackets 
will suit the living mighty Russian organism. 
  [Leontyev] Will you be running in the presidential 
elections? 
  [Lukyanov] I have given absolutely no consideration to this 
step. I am a lawyer. A doctor of legal sciences. Each person 
should operate in the sphere he knows best: I am in the right 
place in parliament. 
  [Leontyev] Who might the next president of Russia be? 
  [Lukyanov] I am opposed to the institution of the presidency 
altogether. A collective president, such as the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium was, handled these functions. The foisting on Russia 
of an independent presidential office counterposed to parliament 
and the elective authorities, especially the elevation of the 
president above all branches of power, corresponds, from my 
viewpoint, neither to national traditions nor to genuine 
democratism. 
  [Leontyev] You believe that the present constitution is of a 
temporary nature? 
  [Lukyanov] I believe that sooner or later the people will 
understand that society needs a constitution that is supported 
by the majority of the population, not one-third of it. 
  [Leontyev] How, in your opinion, will events develop 
further? 
  [Lukyanov] It will all depend on how realistically the 
government evaluates the current situation and the mood of the 
populace and how quickly the authorities understand that it is 
essential to change the policy of "shock therapy." Its 
abandonment is inevitable. Fundamental changes are needed. The 
opposition is not calling for backward moves here but it is 
convinced that the reforms should serve the good of the people, 
the majority of the people, not their impoverishment. 
  [Leontyev] What needs to be done for an improvement in 
people's lives? 
  [Lukyanov] The president told us in his message, having 
adopted statements that have been made repeatedly by the 
opposition: Government regulation of the entry into the market, 
government control of prices, if only of the basic prices, of 
energy particularly, a strengthening of the social focus of each 
step of the state and the reforms, stimulation of the 
investments of national capital in the development of the native 
economy, not in foreign banks, and protection of the interests 
of Russia and its wealth are essential. 
  [Leontyev] Do you believe in the reconstitution of the 
Union, 
as before? 
  [Lukyanov] I am sure that the great community of peoples 
living on our territory will necessarily be victorious, will 
necessarily be reconstituted, and that there will be a new, 
renewed Union. In other forms, possibly, but it will necessarily 
happen. 
  [Leontyev] On what are you working currently? 
  [Lukyanov] There is much work in the Duma, in the 
Legislation 
Committee, of which I am a member. Much time is spent on work in 
my group of deputies, it being necessary to interact with 
various factions. I receive a tremendous number of letters from 
all regions, incredible for one man, and I have to work on these 
also. In addition, a resumption of the trial is possible. I have 
to prepare for this also. 
  [Leontyev] What were your prison conditions like? 
  [Lukyanov] I was in Matrosskaya tishina. Perfectly normal 
conditions, although I spent six months in solitary. The 
attitude was quite calm, restrained, benevolent, and I do not, 
therefore, paint prison in total black. Gandhi said: "Every 
politician should spent some time in a national prison." 
  [Leontyev] Who shared your cell? 
  [Lukyanov] One person, who ultimately said that he had been 
planted there specially. We had a normal relationship. 
  [Leontyev] The downfall of the CPSU and socialism: Was this 
logical or historical chance? 
  [Lukyanov] We need to separate the demolition of the CPSU 
from the downfall of socialism. Socialism and communism will 
live.... I believe that in our country socialism was realized in 
an early phase. Sooner or later a society of social justice will 
be built. It will be popular and nonbureaucratized and will have 
a democratic system of government. And, generally, what is 
currently called the postindustrial society is to a considerable 
extent a society that has imbibed and continues to imbibe many 
principles of socialism. Production itself, the economy itself 
socialize society. 
  [Leontyev] How do you assess the personality of Lenin? 
  [Lukyanov] Lenin was a child of his time, and all his 
publications, merely a particle of his life. Lenin cannot be 
detached from his cause, his gentry family, his beliefs, and his 
activity abroad. We must take him as he was. As a whole, he did 
for Russia, for the people, a great deal, particularly for the 
people who had been humiliated for centuries: for the workers 
and peasants. 
  [Leontyev] Do you idealize Vladimir Ilich? 
  [Lukyanov] No. I view him objectively: I have been through 
many of his documents which are quite frightening, quite 
painful. But politics is politics. An icon should not be made of 
any politician. 
  [Leontyev] Do you support Lenin's reburial? 
  [Lukyanov] This would be blasphemy. Lenin is buried in 
practice, his body is below ground level. He left no testament 
on this matter. Do people want yet a further inflammation of 
passions? The authorities could take this step, of course, but 
there would not be the support among the bulk of the people. 
There would probably be people who want this, but they would be 
the minority.

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Pankov: "Communism Will Live. And We?"] </F>
  [Text] As distinct from many other of the present 
"members of the opposition," A. Lukyanov has been at the helm of 
state. And this being so, he has to bear the responsibility, if 
only moral, for the humiliating position in which our people 
have found themselves. But do you hear in his words even a hint 
of an apology or remorse? You do not. 
  We have before us a most experienced, resourceful 
politician, 
armed, what is more, with the skills of legal and verbal 
tightrope-walking. But this is required in order to have been 
able to come up with the lawyer's opus: Lenin is in practice 
buried inasmuch as his body is below ground level. In this case 
I will prove as surely as two and two make four that Lenin's 
body lies above the level of any Moscow cemetery and, 
consequently, cannot be considered buried.... And each homeless 
person whose corpse lies in a basement may also be deemed to 
have been committed to the earth? 
  Other arguments of the ex-chairman of the Supreme Soviet are 
constructed on the same "logic" also. 
  Who now declares out loud that he is against reforms? Only a 
political suicide, perhaps! Anatoliy Ivanovich has survived 
Brezhnevism, Gorbachevism, and, judging by his ability to say 
something or other or to remain silent, will survive Yeltsinism 
also. You bet: He is, after all, for reforms! For good reforms. 
Which the people need, which are to their benefit, not which 
render them destitute. The poor people--to what have they been 
reduced by the shock therapy!... And as though there was no 
corrosion of the Soviet petrodollars, unchecked growth of the 
military-industrial monster, degradation of the socialist 
countryside, the extinction of an entire region--the center of 
Russia--the squandering of national resources for the support of 
doomed totalitarian regimes.... 
  He is, apparently, for reforms, but pro-communist reforms. 
And this, which is clear even to V. Anpilov, has nothing in 
common with the actual changes that the people are awaiting. And 
somewhere over there, on the periphery, a civil war is under 
way, yet he, the ideologist of communism, here, in the center, 
has no opinion on this. And some people there will not 
understand the president's vain attempts to establish civil 
accord.... Anatoliy Ivanovich is, it would seem, prepared 
even.... 
  All "new Russians," apparently, emphatically all, are 
coalescing with mafia circles and, of course, serving Western 
capital.... Yet I have still not forgotten the clamorous 
criminal trials of the 1980's, when the closest connection 
between mafia-socialist trade and our Communist Party was 
ascertained. And how could a member of the CPSU Central 
Committee Politburo completely forget that there are among the 
"new Russians" many of those that leaped across into 
entrepreneurs' chairs from the Central Committee and the state 
structures and that are, perhaps, turning over "party money"? It 
is not nice to smear one's class brothers. 
  Our compatriots, apparently, are characterized by 
spirituality and... collectivism, not Western capitalism, which, 
as the CPSU-Communist Party of the Russian Federation has 
revealed to us, is absolutely aspiritual, and we are not to be 
suborned by their jeans (A.I. did not say, it is true, what is 
to be done with the Western K. Marx or what the Bolsheviks did 
with our native, celebrated cloth and other pants). 
  Lenin, apparently, made the peasantry and the workers happy. 
Which ones? Those from whom he took away after the victory of 
Soviet power the land and the factories? Those whom he executed 
and starved to death?... 
  Of all that the former all-Union speaker had to say, I 
understood one thing: B. Yeltsin will not achieve peace and 
accord inasmuch as socialism and communism will live.... Whether 
we all will survive here does not concern true communists and 
loyal Leninists. As in all the preceding years of their control 
of a country of slaves.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Pestrukhina: "The Poor Have Outplayed the </F>
Rich"; first paragraph MOSCOW NEWS comment] 
  [Text] The report by the Central Election Committee (CEC) 
on spending financial resources during the December election 
campaign submitted to the Duma has attracted much less attention 
than expected. The deputies managed without parliamentary 
discussions, the press, too, commented on the document rather 
sparingly. What did the financial inspection reveal? 
  A total of 144 billion rubles were allocated from the budget 
for the organization and holding of parliamentary elections and 
the referendum. The actual expenses composed somewhat less than 
112.3 billion. 
  The table compiled after the results of the report reveals 
the exorbitant gap in the expenses on the election campaign 
between the associations of democratic and opposition flanks. 
Since the presentation of Vladimir Isakov who divided the sums 
mentioned in the column of expenses, the average "cost" of one 
deputy was deduced. As we can see from the table the lowest was 
in the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) (1.7 million 
rubles), the highest--in Russia's Choice (47.9 million rubles).

(Expenses given in million rubles) 


  This great difference with the leaders of the democratic 
factions is explained by the fact that only the democratic 
associations honestly mentioned the amount spent. This statement 
may be disregarded, but it is impossible to disregard the fact 
that the entire opposition flank in their reports did not exceed 
the limits of 100 million rubles--the amount allocated to all 
election associations from the state budget. The election 
campaign, however, was financed through a minimum of four 
channels. 
  First--the election fund, to the account of which the 
budgetary 100 million rubles are being transferred and (under 
the law) sponsors' contributions are received. This is the 
official channel that can be checked. But nothing prevents the 
election associations from keeping, on the account of the fund, 
exactly as much money, as was allocated by the state--not more. 
Because the sponsors, if they are of foreign origin, may use 
another way--settle the accounts of elections associations, for 
which the latter are not obliged to report back to the CEC. The 
third source of financing are the accounts of parties and 
organizations making a part of the election association, the CEC 
is not obliged to check them (and did not check). Finally, the 
fourth source is what we call "black cash." These receipts are 
not subject to any verification and, therefore, as though do not 
exist at all. 
  It was the duty of election associations to report only on 
the expenses from election funds (they are precisely given in 
the table), and the duty of the Central Election Committee--only 
to check these reports. However, the CEC went further and tried 
to investigate the second channel. According to the statement by 
Tamara Petronavicius, head of the financial department, 
inquiries were made to TV and radio companies, leading 
printshops and even banks. All the non-state organizations 
preferred to keep mum (the law does not commit one to grant such 
information) but the state TV and radio companies responded to 
the inquiry. 
  As it was to be expected, the services by sponsors who 
directly settled the accounts of election associations were 
enjoyed by all. Thus, the firm Premier paid 33 million rubles 
for radio broadcasts of Russia's Choice, the Mars company--62 
million rubles for the TV publicity of the Democratic Party of 
Russia (DPR), and the Sokol leisure center--almost 75 million 
for the TV programs of the LDPR. However, the receipts "from 
additional sources" revealed by the CEC, proved to be 
unimportant, which shows the high professionalism of the 
"bookkeepers" of the election associations: expenses which can 
be easily checked (first of all for TV and radio broadcasts) 
were paid mainly from election funds. The sponsors' non-cash 
funds, according to experts, could be used to pay for printed 
matter, to lease premises, and other verifiable expenses. 
  Naturally, there are no documentary proofs on the use of 
"black cash." Of course, it is possible that the services of, 
say, "collectors of signatures" were paid under the item "Other 
expenses," and five blocs--Russia's Choice, PRUA, Civic-Union, 
Russian Democratic Reform Movement (RDRM) and the LDPR did not 
pay a kopek to their canvassers. However, even the CEC won't 
take the risk of maintaining that what the reports represented 
were exhaustive data. Confidential sources close to the election 
headquarters of Choice and PRUA assure that the real expenses of 
these blocs are 3-4 times more than those published. It would be 
no exaggeration to assume that the expenses of other 
participants in the election campaign must be assessed in a 
similar proportion. 
  According to official reports, the sponsors of Russia's 
Choice are leading banks and trade corporations specializing in 
export-import operations (the banks Stolichny Olbi-Diplomat and 
others). Similar structures back up Grigory Yavlinsky. The 
Centrist blocs "milked" former state enterprises and concerns 
(now formally non-state) thanks to extensive contacts among the 
directors. Even after inspection, the sources financing the LDPR 
remain a mystery: the "exposed" official sponsors are small, not 
serious firms, the other hypotheses published in various 
publications were not confirmed by any documents. Only 
communists and agrarians used their electorate for financial 
support: the former drew, as they put it, the party money--the 
fees of half a million members, the latter relied on the funds 
of transformed, but actually kept collective and state farms. 
  It may be assumed that in the future, too, democratic blocs 
may count on strong financial "rears" and economic advantages 
over their opponents. But for success at the elections, as this 
past December has shown, big capitals are not enough. 
Significant in this sense is the disastrous failure of 
"centrists." The associations Civic Union and New Names that 
enjoined the covert support of Premier Chernomyrdin (New Names 
was financed by Gazprom) were not short of means. Despite this, 
they did not gain a single mandate. 
  The financial report of the CEC presented democrats with yet 
another unpleasant surprise. Only three associations--Russia's 
Choice, Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc and Civic Union--were 
officially exposed as receiving donations from firms with 
foreign capital. It is noteworthy that in the report ascribed to 
the sponsors "of mixed blood" are the firms not only with 
British, American and other capital, but also the joint-stock 
company Aircraft industry (a former USSR Chief Directorate), as 
well as the joint-stock company Metalkhim (both financed the 
Civic Union): about 5% of the stocks of the first company 
belong to enterprises from the ex-Soviet republics, of the 
second, even less--only 2%. 
  According to Tamara Petronavicius, the operating legislation 
does not always help to determine what firms must be considered 
as "with foreign participation." 
  The CEC has prepared proposals for the new election law. It 
is suggested that hence the participants in elections must 
transfer all sponsor means to the accounts of election funds and 
only through this official channel all the payments must be 
effected. However, this demand can hardly be fulfilled: it is 
impossible to check everything that is printed in thousands of 
small printshops or on the duplicating machines of hundreds of 
thousands of organizations in different regions of the country. 
Just as it is impossible to keep an eye on all the broadcasts of 
private radio companies and cable TV channels... 
  The obvious "approximation" of the financial report of the 
CEC explains the fact that it was taken by the Council of the 
Duma "into consideration." Most likely, the work of legislators 
will end on this point: the "poor" have outplayed the "rich" on 
all matters, including commercial, and both participated in the 
game according to the same rules and, therefore, are equally 
convinced that it is hopeless and dangerous to get at the roots 
of things.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Zhirnov: "The Central Election Commission </F>
Revealed the Secret of the Contributions. The Duma Covered It 
Up"] 
  [Text] The Central Election Commission of the Russian 
Federation sent the State Duma a document, according to which 
almost one out of every four deputies should be deprived of his 
mandate. 
  In accordance with the Statute on Elections of Deputies of 
the State Duma, the Central Election Commission has no later 
than three months following the official publication of the 
election results to present the State Duma with an account of 
the expenditure of monetary resources by the election 
associations. No later than a month following its receipt by the 
Duma this account should be published in "publications in which 
federal laws are to be published and communicated to other news 
media." 
  All the deadlines have passed. Nothing has been published 
anywhere. There is not even the Central Election Commission 
account to the Duma. 
  This is not entirely the case, though. It is all far more 
involved. 
  Some document from the Central Election Commission was 
received in the Duma, apparently. Was received and sank without 
trace, causing none of the ripples on the surface which are 
expected in such cases. 
  Your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer managed to obtain the 
mysterious paper. Even at first glance it evokes a multitude of 
questions and misgivings. Printed with grammatical errors and 
any old how, the stitched document has neither signature nor 
stamps nor source and entry data attesting its receipt in the 
chamber. Nor is there the decision in the margins: "Copy and 
distribute to the factions"--signed and dated--customary in such 
cases. 
  Hot on the trail, colleagues from the newspaper ZAVTRA have 
already randomly extracted and published what is, seemingly, the 
tastiest information--data on violations by the Russia's Choice 
and Yabloko election associations of the article of the Statute 
on Elections... prohibiting the acceptance of monetary donations 
from companies formed with foreign participation. 
  The biggest contributions from donors of this type were paid 
into the Russia's Choice election fund: R154.8 million from the 
Stolichnyy Joint-Stock Commercial Bank; R130 million from the 
Olbi-Diplomat Stock Company; R30 million from the Skyline 
Russo-British joint venture. For Yabloko sponsors with foreign 
participation were the Viamond LTD Stock Company--R30 
million--and the Torgovlya i kredit Stock Company and the 
Optsion Bank--R10 million each. The participation of foreign 
capital in the Russia's Choice and Yabloko campaigns is reason 
in principle to raise the question of deprivation of the 
deputies of this faction of their Duma mandates. 
  But this is not all the document contains. Its basic text is 
composed of an affirmation of the numerous "deficiencies in the 
election associations' observance of financial discipline." The 
absence of documents confirming the actual performance of jobs 
and services, for example, are classed as "deficiencies." For 
the Democratic Party of Russia for a total of almost R70 million 
and for the Party of Russian Unity and Accord for R20.7 million, 
for the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia for an absence of 
stamps on accounts for R62.9 million, and so forth. The authors 
of the document, evidently, on the one hand recognized the 
seriousness of the facts and could not fail to adduce them, on 
the other, deliberately lowered the categorization of these 
abuses to "deficiencies in the observance of discipline." The 
account gives the impression of some rough copy or memorandum 
conveyed confidentially for the familiarization of the requisite 
persons or of a trial balloon released to test the retaliatory 
response. But what is most surprising and incomprehensible is 
the subsequent fate of this document. 
  The Duma factions know of, remember, and have opinions about 
the document. The Russia's Choicers, whose guilt it establishes, 
maintain that Russia's Choice and Yabloko are the sole election 
associations to have honestly and openly published their sources 
of financing. This, allegedly, is why they were hit. Others also 
would, most likely, be found to have similar sins: The Germans' 
funding of the LDPR is known, after all. The deputy who handed 
your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer the document expressed the hope 
that the newspaper would "dig up" violations among Russia's 
Choice's opponents also: "Go looking--there are no honest 
communists." Russia's Choice had even prepared a complaint to 
the Central Election Commission demanding publication of all the 
data, but it was not sent. 
  Nonetheless, the sight of the document in the hands of a 
journalist had literally a shock effect on the Duma authorities 
that it concerned primarily, it would seem. People in the 
Credentials Commission had a stunned look: "Where did you get 
this? We don't have this." They asked to make a copy, but 
immediately had second thoughts. Oleg Shenkarev, deputy chairman 
of the commission, repeated several times that this was an 
"extremely delicate" matter and that "a serious picture 
emerges." And hereupon categorically declared that until the 
commission had a document with signatures and a stamp, it would 
be examining nothing. 
  The curtain on the mysterious origin of the strange paper 
was 
lifted slightly when your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer turned for 
clarification to Valentin Kovalev, deputy chairman of the State 
Duma. Valentin Alekseyevich also acknowledged that he had not 
seen the Central Election Commission account and also asked to 
make a copy, kindly agreeing to comment on the document "from 
the legal standpoint." But at the time scheduled for the 
interview he also suddenly began to have misgivings: Was this an 
authentic account of the Central Election Commission? "Why do I 
not have it? Such documents should be on my desk! We have just 
now learned that this document was not received by the Duma." 
  In the presence of your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer he, 
however, telephoned State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, who 
confirmed the authenticity of the document and announced that it 
was being distributed in the Duma with his consent. Replacing 
the receiver, Kovalev suddenly remembered that "the Duma Council 
considered this document on its merits and adopted the decision 
to take note of it." 
  Valentin Alekseyevich himself described this decision as 
"highly neutral." While cautioning that this "does not mean that 
the matter is closed--it could be considered at a sitting of the 
State Duma also," the deputy chairman emphasized that for this 
"someone has to raise the issue. It is not being contemplated 
thus far, according to my information." 
  "As a lawyer," Kovalev concluded that legislation made no 
provision for legal liability for the violations perpetrated by 
Russia's Choice and Yabloko. To the candid question as to why 
the opponents of Russia's Choice and Yabloko had not availed 
themselves of so splendid an opportunity to get in a political 
blow, the deputy chairman, a member of the Communist Party of 
the Russian Federation faction, replied with references to the 
Duma's preoccupation with problems of the budget and the 
achievement of national accord. The same reason was cited also 
by Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia 
faction: "What business is this of the Duma's? If the Central 
Election Commission has discovered violations, let it apply to 
the law enforcement authorities. Our faction has no interest in 
constantly looking to the past. There is too much to do today to 
be rummaging around in yesterday's shit." 
  Some not so "titled" deputies explain the State Duma's more 
than indifferent attitude toward the sins of the election 
campaign by reasons of a totally different quality, alas. Not by 
the lower house's total immersion in far-reaching business 
designed to secure for the country a bright future but by a fear 
of touching what--merely a touch--would start to flake off 
uncontrollably or cave in completely even. Mikhail Molostvov 
believes: "Rummage around, and you will discover the dubious 
nature of all the elections. This is why nothing is being said 
about this." In the opinion of Ayvars Lezdinsh, "corporate 
interest in this case outweighed everything else. Almost 
everyone understands that if investigations start, they could 
ultimately reach him also. Not only were the factions guilty of 
violations, the head-to-head constituency deputies are no 
exception either." 
  The "presidential host" might, perhaps, have made a fuss and 
have attempted to deliver the Duma a mortal blow, the opposition 
having been caught in financial peccadilloes. But, as ill luck 
would have it, its "own people" were caught also. The opposition 
also was faced with a dilemma: Should it insist on an annulment 
of the election results? The members of the opposition realize 
full well that the complete "removal" of their political 
adversaries from the Duma would make the lower house an 
inoperative body and would break up its whole structure, which 
had been put together with such difficulty and in which the 
opposition had succeeded in occupying pretty good places. 
  There is a certain common thread linking the president and 
parliament and the Central Election Commission and, most likely, 
many others also. This is the actual historical action of 12 
December of last year. The hastily organized presidential-model 
elections were conducted in a "bundle" with a referendum on a 
constitution dear to the president's heart. Violations in one 
part of this action would compel reflection on the legality of 
the other. This is why both sides are trying not to make a fuss. 
Some under the pressure of the sorry necessity of sending others 
a semi-official paper deliberately reducing the scale of the 
lawlessness, others swiftly and quietly "taking note of it." All 
this is reminiscent of the syndrome, well known in psychiatry, 
of the forcing into the subconscious of facts of which one is 
ashamed and which are dangerous for one's reputation.

<F P=106> [Natalya Kuzina report: "The Centrists Have Gotten Their </F>
Second Wind"] 
  [Text] Brief reports on the formation of a Popular 
Alliance intrigued the politicized community for several months. 
But this also is no longer a secret. 
  The constituent conference of the organizing committee of 
the 
Popular Alliance Russian patriotic movement was held recently in 
Moscow. Its "stars" include A. Golovin, S. Glazyev, D. 
Olshanskiy, and O. Rumyantsev. 
  The need for the appearance of the movement is explained by 
its organizers primarily by the fact that society's political 
requirements are going begging. A clear demonstration of this 
were the December elections in Russia, when almost half the 
electorate voted with its feet. 
  "There is no party or movement that could express the 
genuine 
interests of the people and come to power with their support. 
Today there is not, but there soon will be," D. Olshanskiy 
declared. The new political force in the shape of the Popular 
Alliance is to combine "the values of patriotism and democracy 
and the interests of the political elite and of millions of 
ordinary citizens." The formulation of such a task dictates also 
a wide spectrum of interaction with various political 
organizations. And the founders of the movement make no secret 
of the fact that it is conceived as a consolidating nucleus of 
the social-patriotic forces. 
  It is indicative that the program statement of the Popular 
Alliance was signed by many well-known figures of the Civic 
Union. V. Menshov, V. Mironenko, S. Polozkov, A. Tsipko, A. 
Chilingarov.... Centrism is gaining its second wind, it may be 
said. 
  Despite its very young age, the Popular Alliance has formed 
10 regional organizations. Their priority tasks include the 
formulation of a program with which it will take part in 
elections at all levels.

<F P=106> [Report by Yekaterina Achalova and Yekaterina Poymenova: </F>
"Zyuganov, Anpilov, and Rutskoy Are Prepared To Be President"] 
  [Text] A review of the forces of the Russian 
opposition was conducted last weekend. The Communist Party of 
the Russian Federation held an all-Union party conference, the 
Working Russia movement, a congress, and the National Salvation 
Front, a session of the National Council. While having 
unanimously rejected the Social Accord Treaty offered by Boris 
Yeltsin, the opposition parties and movements were unable to 
achieve unity concerning a possible candidate at the future 
presidential elections. 
  The most likely candidate of the Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation for the office of president will be, by all 
accounts, its present chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov. Zyuganov was 
successful at the conference in warding off all attacks of the 
intra-party opposition demanding that the leadership of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation adopt a stricter 
dogmatic position. The delegates supported by a huge majority 
the party's program propositions offered by Gennadiy Zyuganov, 
which were sustained in a statist style, which will undoubtedly 
improve relations between the communists and the patriots. 
  A far more complex problem for the Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation are relations with other parties and 
movements cleaving to positions of dogmatic communism. 
Addressing the congress of the Working Russia movement, its 
leader, Viktor Anpilov, accused Zyuganov of class collaboration 
with the "Yeltsin regime" and declared that the present leader 
of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation is "an even 
bigger traitor than Gorbachev." The orthodox named as their 
possible candidates for the office of president Vasiliy 
Starodubtsev, Oleg Shein, Sazha Umalatova, Aman Tuleyev, and 
Viktor Anpilov. The delegates were of the unanimous opinion here 
that the main task of a president they elected should be 
abolition of the presidency and the restoration of Soviet power 
in full. Only Ilya Konstantinov, leader of the National 
Salvation Front, intends as yet, it would seem, to support 
Aleksandr Rutskoy, the former opposition president. But such 
support is hardly likely to increase Rutskoy's chances of 
success at the future presidential elections. As the session of 
the National Salvation Front National Council showed, this 
opposition organization has now virtually ceased to exist and 
unites only a few political chiefs. A large part of the regional 
organizations, on the other hand, has joined Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's party.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Zhirnov: "The Speaker Moves Away From the </F>
Bank"] 
  [Text] The surprise impertinence of Ivan Rybkin, 
chairman of the State Duma, who signed the Social Accord Treaty 
without having obtained the formal authorization of the house 
for this, has been viewed in the Duma has an action that was, 
albeit not incontestable, undoubtedly unusual. Some people were 
immediately reminded of the incomparable somersaults of Ruslan 
Imranovich. 
  Those who reacted with the most irritation to the speaker's 
unusual move were the old associates of both Rybkin and 
Khasbulatov. Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the communist faction, 
for example, believes that the chairman of the house had 
absolutely no right to sign anything on behalf of the Duma 
without having put this question to the vote and without having 
obtained a minimum of 50 percent of the vote. Even more annoyed 
by the speaker's action was Sergey Baburin, leader of the 
Russia's Way group of deputies. Rybkin's actions, according to 
him, "are an unprecedented step destroying the idea of the 
separation of powers and the idea of parliament as such." 
Baburin made a firm promise to seek the speaker's resignation 
after the May holidays. 
  Subsequently, in conversation with your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA 
observer, he specified: "We will raise the question of the style 
of work of the chairman of the State Duma. To what extent is 
Rybkin coping with his duties? He is in breach of the standing 
orders of the Duma almost daily and he disregarded the opinion 
of the majority of deputies in the appointment of the leader of 
the administrative system. If Rybkin's political predilections 
are gaining the ascendancy, he should give way to someone else." 
  Baburin will hardly succeed in moving Ivan Petrovich from 
the 
presidium to the stalls. Even his fellow thinker Viktor 
Ilyukhin, who has repeatedly publicly rebuked the speaker for 
his "born-again" character, acknowledges that the question of 
the speaker's resignation could only be raised at this time as a 
warning. It could be attempted, but success is unlikely. 
  This does not mean, of course, that the chairman of the 
house 
may feel totally secure. As many people believe, the opposition 
will leave him in peace only until the end of the summer 
vacation and that subsequently his Agrarian Party and Communist 
Party comrades, who moved him into the speaker's chair, will try 
to talk with him in party fashion. It is said that the 
agrarians, who have not as yet in public treated the speaker of 
the house badly, have already "worked" on him several times in a 
small group. Rybkin's withdrawal from the directive bodies of 
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation is a purposeful 
sign also. 
  But while losing friends in his native camp, Ivan Petrovich 
is, naturally, acquiring them in the other. The Russia's Choicer 
Gleb Yakunin told your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer that he 
welcomes the Baburinites' intention to initiate Rybkin's 
resignation: "This gambit will fail, for all that, and Rybkin 
will move even closer to us. And his name is such that he will 
swim from one side to the other." 
  That Rybkin is "swimming" is, indeed, noticeable. But to 
suppose after Gleb Yakunin that the speaker's route will lie 
from one political bank to the other and will soon bring him to 
Russia's Choice would be to suspect Ivan Petrovich of an 
uncritical assimilation of the experience of Khasbulatov. He 
will, most likely, not go to the bank: The smart fish searches 
where the water is deeper. In his inauguration speech even the 
newly elected speaker promised to create in the Duma a "strong 
center" by "weakening the fringes." It is in this sense, most 
likely, that we should perceive also Rybkin's "social 
democratism"--as something central between the communists and 
the democrats. And the movement from left to right could, 
generally, be aimed in actual fact at upward ascent. 
  In this sense Ivan Petrovich is the direct opposite of 
Ruslan 
Imranovich. Having come to head a "freely elected parliament," 
the first in Russia's history, whose legitimacy is not disputed 
even by Yeltsin, a parliament for whose breakup Yeltsin would 
have no justification, Rybkin has not made the slightest attempt 
to take advantage of this "historic opportunity." On the 
contrary, he is effecting an evolution the opposite of 
Khasbulatov's. The latter went from unquestioning support of the 
president to uncompromising struggle against him, Rybkin, from 
being of an opposition frame of mind to manifest and unmanifest 
actions of support. 
  The most important of these actions as of the present has 
been the conclusion of that Social Accord Treaty itself. Ivan 
Petrovich did not, after all, simply append his signature, 
running the risk of a violation of the Duma's standing orders, 
and did not simply afford the president an opportunity to "seize 
the initiative" of peacemaking. Throughout this campaign he had 
right from the outset prepared for both the Duma and himself the 
modest role of "No. 2" and ally of the opposite side. Back in 
the morning of 23 February, when no one knew how the intrepid 
venture of the amnesty and the Duma accord memorandum would end, 
Rybkin let slip the words, not noticed at that time, that "we 
need... a unique Russian social treaty or agreement with the 
consolidating role of President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin." It 
was in this direction that he steered, despite the resistance of 
the parliamentary opposition--in the direction of the 
"consolidating" or, simply put, principal role of the president 
in what had primordially been a Duma undertaking. 
  And how dexterously the chairman stepped on the brakes on 
the 
painful question of the location of the lower house! And how 
decisive he was in the appointment to the position of chairman 
of the Duma administrative system of the "president's man" 
Andrey Voykov, although they had quite recently, in 
September-October, been on different sides of the barricades! 
  No, Rybkin is definitely not an avenger, an insurgent. He 
is, 
rather, a skillful integrator who has expertly written the Duma 
into the system of power created since October and who is doing 
everything to ensure that it "not protrude" from this system. 
One of my Duma interlocutors observed philosophically: "Rybkin 
is Kant's 'thing in itself.' He does not lean toward either one 
or the other, working only for himself. He has no desire to 
perish beneath the rubble of the Duma and wants only to 
consolidate his place in the system. In today's hierarchy he is 
somewhere around the Ryabov level and would like to rise higher." 
  If a place in the hierarchy is determined by the volume of 
services rendered, it is still too soon to put Ivan Petrovich 
above Ryabov but he has, after all, only just begun, and 
everything lies ahead for him. And it is by no means a fact that 
he will "swim" directly to the president's fish pond. He could 
at the right moment turn off to the side also. Journalists are 
noting that the speaker of the Duma has become a frequent guest 
of the prime minister also. The prime minister is seen with 
Rybkin far more often than with Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of 
the Federation Council and a man of the "president's group." 
They are, evidently, in some way of interest and use to one 
another....

<F P=106> [Article by Stepan Kiselyov: "Who Is on the Minds of </F>
Newspapers"; first paragraph MOSCOW NEWS comment] 
  [Text] In March of 1994, PRAVDA wrote more frequently about 
Boris Yeltsin than other newspapers while IZVESTIA mentioned 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky more frequently. 
  For a year now, sociologists of the Public Opinion fund have 
been calculating how frequently the names of famous persons are 
mentioned in five central newspapers. They do this regardless of 
the context, no matter if he is heaped with abuse or is dipped 
in holy oil. That is why "the accounting of newspaper 
popularity" is concerned least of all with journalists' likes or 
dislikes, but with who was on the tongue of newspapermen in a 
given month and, correspondingly, who was in the minds of the 
readers of these newspapers. 
  Judging by the names with the highest index of being 
mentioned, the Russian press remains super-politicized. 
Forty-three out of the first fifty names are politicians. But 
politicians are gradually retreating from the newspaper field; 
last year their showing was even more expressive and the 
aggregate index of the mentioning of politicians amounted to 
6,047 points in March of 1993 as opposed to 3,696 points in 
March of 1994. Even the attention of journalists to President 
Yeltsin, who still leads the list has fallen threefold during 
the year, from 2,049 to 699 points. 
  As for rising stars, the leader is undeniably the political 
scandal-monger Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who didnt' even make the 
final fifty last year, and who now occupies seventh place (174 
points). The attention of the press to Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin has grown considerably (229 as opposed to 156 
points), which testifies not only to the enhanced role of his 
government but also to his personal potential as a possible 
candidate for the presidency in 1996. It is improtant to note 
that the rules of the game in politics demand that a person with 
ambitions should always be "within ear-shot" of the electors and 
that any mention of his name in a newspaper is publicity. Among 
young politicians regarded by the press as possible presidential 
candidates, the highest rating belongs to Yegor Gaidar (93 
points). The leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, 
Sergei Shakhrai, ranks 27th (48 points), while the leader of the 
Yabloko parliamentary faction Grigory Yavlinsky did not even 
make the first fifty names, falling behind not only chess 
players Garri Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov but also actress 
Victoria Ruffo from the superpopular serial "Simply Maria." It 
should be said that all the latter, including the spy Aldrich 
Ames (197 points), whose popularity in March was less only than 
that of Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomydrin, should be 
considered "wandering stars" since their appearance at the top 
of the scale is quite accidental and liable to fade out by the 
end of the month. 
  If the mention of a name in a newspaper is considered 
advertisement, a closer analysis of the list of "newspaper 
stars" reveals a paradox: Boris Yeltsin and Yegor Gaidar are 
advertised more than others by PRAVDA and SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, 
while Vladimir Zhirinovsky gets more publicity from IZVESTIYA 
and MOSCOW NEWS. This is probably explained by the fact that 
ideological opponents are nearer and dearer than those who share 
one's views. For the Russian press, which is tradionally the 
epicenter of political struggle, the genre of expose remains, in 
the view of newspapermen, the essence of their work.

  [Text] The slogan of civil accord is the key fashion today. 
The Right calls upon the Left to adopt it, the Left calls upon 
the Right, the Centre--upon the flanks, and further on all along 
the front. But already the first approaches to negotiations have 
shown: "civil accord" is a notion replete with many 
interpretations. 
  With this publication MN offers its own negotiating process. 
<H5>  A very timely idea </H5>
  Boris YELTSIN: "The need for an Agreement on reaching civil 
accord in Russia has been brought forth and prepared by the 
entire course of political life in the country, however 
contradictory it may seem, and by the requirement to ensure 
society's political stability and to support the seeds of civil 
peace." 
  Ella PAMFILOVA (Russia's Choice faction): Agreement among 
all 
the opposing sides is possible in principle. It will be a big 
achievement if the opponents come to terms with the civilized 
methods of political struggle, and give up violence. But it is 
difficult to reach even this kind of agreement. There is no 
certainty that those who signed will not harbor cunning thoughts 
and will not use the agreement to lull the vigilance of 
opponents. It is even more difficult to reach accord on the 
fundamental questions of policy and the economy, most 
importantly, on the methods and aims of the reform. There is a 
risk that the document will be limited to demagogic formulations 
which can bring about unprincipled compromises. As a result, we 
shall continue rotting in the quagmire. 
  Gennady ZYUGANOV (Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation): 
I will speak not about the idea of accord, but about the idea of 
national reconciliation. It really hangs in the air. And we have 
this kind of historical experience. In December 1941, when the 
Nazis were at the walls of Moscow, victimized Cossacks, 
dispossessed peasants and exiled intellectuals participated 
together in a nationwide front. Now we also have a common 
adversary--it is the anti-people, anti-policy which has been 
called radical reforms. 
  Sergei SHAKHRAI (Party of Russian Unity and Accord): 
Agreement is possible in principle. I am not surprised that 
preparations are proceeding with difficulties. There are many 
reasons for this. First and foremost, we lack political culture: 
everyone is impatient, everyone is settling accounts with 
everyone else. Moreover, there is no full-fledged multiparty 
system in the country. Social groups are not associated with a 
party of their own. And, lastly, the country is at a turning 
point, in conditions of the deepest political and economic 
crisis. The most important thing now is not to permit a war over 
how to create peace. 
  Vladimir LYSENKO (Republican Party of Russia, "Yabloko" 
faction): The idea is very timely. But we already signed several 
agreements (true, not such wide-ranging ones) with the 
President. (For instance, in December 1991 between the President 
and the political parties.) Yet none of them was fulfilled. The 
President forgot all about these documents right after their 
signing. What was important for him was the process, not the 
result. 
<H5>  To adopt as the basis? </H5>
  Boris YELTSIN: "The first stage of work on the text of the 
Agreement is over... The possibility of joint constructive work 
by representatives from different branches of authority, parties 
and trade unions became clear already in the process of drafting 
it." 
  Ella PANFILOVA: In the draft presented by the President, 
there is something to work with. But the document needs to be 
examined very thoroughly--among other things, the social aspects. 
  Gennady ZYUGANOV: The document contains reasonable 
proposals. 
But, if we are to speak about it as a whole, it is written very 
simple: don't touch the "sacred cow" known as the Constitution, 
don't re-elect ahead of time those who have reduced the country 
to its present-day condition. And forget what happened on 
October 3-4. In exchange? We promise not to abuse you... 
  Sergei SHAKHRAI: The draft presented by the President is 
almost in finished form. And though we have made our proposals 
for improving it, in principle we are ready to sign it even now. 
  Vladimir LYSENKO: When the document was ready in its rough 
form, it had to be discussed with the various factions, parties 
and the President. But for some reasons the President instructed 
his aides to expand it. Regrettably, he met only with Russia's 
Choice though it would not be bad at all to exchange views with 
the others, too... 
  Our faction--"Yabloko"--has not yet made the final decision. 
In the Republican Party, however, the draft was discussed, and 
we are preparing a package of proposals. But the overwhelming 
majority believes: the draft can be signed, things will not be 
any worse. 
<H5>  Ground for accord? </H5>
  Boris YELTSIN: "One hears sceptical voices claiming that an 
Agreement is impossible given the present-day state of society. 
This point of view leads us into an impasse. The population, the 
majority of political parties and a considerable part of the 
deputy corps are interested in accord and political stability..." 
  Vladimir LYSENKO: "I believe that the whole Agreement should 
consist of two points. The opposition guarantees that in the 
course of two years it will not press for the dismissal of the 
President and will quietly wait till the next elections. In 
reply, Yeltsin guarantees that he will not dissolve the Federal 
Assembly and let it live until the next President is elected. 
Besides, the Agreement must necessarily be signed by all the 
factions of the State Duma. If it has been signed solely by the 
trade unions, businessmen, directors, the government, the 
republics and the President and has not been signed by 
representatives from the opposition, this document will be 
meaningless. 
  Gennady ZYUGANOV: Our faction has very thoroughly discussed 
the presidential draft and formulated the conditions on the 
basis of which, we believe, accord can be reached. They include: 
a change of the present-day course, the formation of a 
government of national confidence, urgent measures aimed to 
combat corruption and theft, steps for the social protection of 
the population (indexation of pensions, an increase and timely 
pay of stipends to students, timely pay of wages, paying the 
debts to the peasantry). As far as the signing procedure is 
concerned, this is a question of fundamental importance. The 
Agreement must primarily be signed by political forces. And for 
this there is a need for decisions by elective bodies--at 
plenums, conferences and congresses. 
  Sergei SHAKHRAI: The point is not so much in the content of 
the document as in the procedure of its signing. It is important 
that representatives from polar forces should take their seats 
at the negotiating table. Each politician and each political 
force must pass this document through themselves, to consider 
this text to be their own and not submitted from above. 
  Ella PAMFILOVA: Today everyone agrees on a similar selection 
of populist catchwords--for a great Russia, against the 
impoverishment of the masses. But even catchwords must be 
treated very carefully. Is it possible to unite Russia on the 
principles of rigid nationalism? Is it possible to vanquish 
poverty by giving up economic reforms? There is still a need to 
unite on a clearly formulated foundation. 
<H5>  Guarantee coupon </H5>
  Boris YELTSIN: "The Conciliatory Commission controls the 
observance of the provisions formalized by this Agreement... 
Upon ascertaining the facts of the Agreement being violated the 
Conciliatory Commission: 
  --makes a pertinent statement in the mass media; 
  --poses a question about excluding the participant from the 
number of those who signed the Agreement; 
  --tables a proposal on measures bearing on the political 
responsibility of persons...all the way to relieving them from 
the leading positions they hold and laying down deputy powers." 
  Sergei SHAKHRAI: I would name three main guarantees for the 
fulfilment of the Agreement. First, the honor and dignity of the 
people from different political forces. Second, control over the 
mass media. And third, we have suggested that this Agreement be 
adopted as a law. And here the sequence of steps is important. 
The law must be adopted after all have signed it. But even if 
someone disagrees, once the law has been adopted, it affects 
everyone. 
  Gennady ZYUGANOV: Accord can be reached if the document is 
created from below. This is the best guarantee. All the more so 
since no legal norms must be built into it. Only moral and 
political commitments. 
  Vladimir LYSENKO: The question about guarantees is the most 
difficult one. The President suggests setting up a Conciliatory 
Commission which will censure and penalize someone. I think that 
this is naive. If someone violates the Agreement, it will mean 
that it is not in force. At best there will be a need to appeal 
to public opinion. Any attempts to formulate some political or 
legal mechanism are unfeasible. 
<H5>  Weather for tomorrow </H5>
  Boris YELTSIN: "I believe that adoption and implementation 
of 
the Agreement are feasible." 
  Gennady ZYUGANOV: The chances of signing the document on 
accord are high enough. We don't have any special choices. There 
are only three variants for the development of the political 
situation in Russia: first--a criminal-mafiosi state; second--a 
large-scale conflict and mass social eruptions, and third--the 
evolutionary path of changes. The first two roads will hardly 
suit the President. But if the evolutionary process proceeds in 
a democratic way, at least on the surface, then the Left-centre 
forces will come to power in a legitimate way... 
  Vladimir LYSENKO: The Agreement has a chance for success. 
Relations between the opposition and the regime have become more 
positive. The pendulum has continued moving leftward. Therfore 
the opposition has quieted down. Earlier they wanted to topple 
the President immediately. Now the opposition, at any rate the 
parliamentary one, has come to the conclusion that it is better 
to wait two years than provoke clashes. 
<H5>  MN policy desk </H5>
  The draft Agreement prepared by the President has been made 
public. This event is, in effect, a starting point of the 
official negotiating process. Judging by comments, the way to 
civil reconciliation will not be easy. Making the first 
statements, the sides have so far designated their extreme 
claims. A process of long political bargaining lies ahead which 
must result in mutual concessions. But will there be any? And if 
there will, will it be possible to keep the course towards 
democracy and the market alive? For the time being, at any rate, 
accord has been reached on only one thing--on the sides' 
readiness to renounce unconstitutional action. This, as 
politicians believe, is the minimum program. It is not ruled 
out, however, that this minimum is the maximum for today's 
Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Pankov: "Will Russia Die From Tights </F>
and Chewing Gum?"] 
  [Text] [begin box] 
<H5>  These Statements Are Not Zhirinovskiy's... </H5>
  To the editors of the newspaper KURANTY 
  In the issue of your newspaper for 16 December 1993 you 
attributed the following statements to me: "We must provoke war 
among the tribes," "we should think about colonies," "we must 
force our republics to return"--which do not belong to me and 
which could be perceived by the readers as propaganda for war 
and violence. 
  [Signed] Chairman of the LDPR faction V.V. Zhirinovskiy 
  Such was the letter our editors received from V. 
Zhirinovskiy. We were forced to publish it since the 
correspondent who submitted the article to us did not keep the 
dictaphone recording tape. And although he was prepared to 
affirm wherever necessary that the LDPR leader did say all these 
words, alas, verbal assurances cannot be tacked on. 
  [Signed] The editorial board. [end box] 
  ...But these statements do belong to V. Zhirinovskiy. 
And he made them not in some back room or in a small group but 
at a congress (already the fifth) of his own Liberal Democratic 
Party held recently in Moscow (the texts are from a stenographic 
report of the congress). 
  One can understand why V.V.Zh. sent us this letter: The 
procuracy had begun to study his statements to see the extent to 
which they approached violating one law or another. V.V.Zh. 
tries to look angelic: He is concerned about the well-being of 
the Russian people and at the same time he does not want to 
offend any other people. What kind of provocation of conflicts 
and wars is there in that? What kind of violence? What kind of 
degradation of other peoples?... 
<H5>  Such a Gentle V.V.Zh. </H5>
  "Here we are before you, delegates to the Fifth LDPR 
Congress. We are not preparing for war. We are not seizing 
foreign territories, we are not offending anyone. We are 
speaking about our position and relying on constitutional 
support from our constituents." 
  "We are making it a point to express ourselves in gentle 
terms so that people will fear us less. We always speak this 
gently, but people fear us so much in Russia and abroad that I 
do not know which tender and kind words to choose..." 
(Applause) 
  But if such harmless creatures have gathered in the LDPR 
under Zhirinovskiy's banners, why is it that many normal, 
psychologically balanced people when hearing the gentle 
statements of V.V.Zh. feel their skin crawl and have only one 
association: Zhirinovskiy means war? 
  Actually, there could be nothing epochal in the speech of 
the 
chairman of the LDPR. It was neither an accountability report 
nor a report on the current moment. It was really not a report 
at all but a "speech," that is, a spontaneous spate of words 
typically in the spirit of V.V.Zh. It did not contain even a 
hint of a program of actions with the exception of a distant 
objective--in the next elections to be president and a 
closer-range objective--to establish a personal dictatorship in 
the party. And all the rest was words, words, words... 
  I want to apologize to our readers: I perceived so 
ironically 
V.V.Zh.'s empty, Khlestakovian promises, his attempts to change 
from a toad into a prince--the new savior of the Motherland; I 
believed so strongly in the political acuity of the readers, in 
their inherent lack of receptivity to any attempts to return to 
totalitarianism that I have never once spoken out about the 
activity of the LDPR and its creator. Moreover, I have not 
considered it especially necessary for any publicists to take up 
space on the pages of KURANTY to fill this void. My only excuse 
is that many other people made wise by life have ended up in the 
same position. 
  It is quite obvious to me that the phenomenon of V.V.Zh. is 
another instance of the phenomenon of Mussolini, Hitler, and 
Lenin-Stalin. How did they reach the political heights? With all 
the particularities of this ascent, they still have something in 
common. 
  In all of their countries there was a postwar 
crisis--economic confusion, loss of confidence in authority, 
and, as a result, uncontrollability. And hence--all-encompassing 
FEAR. 
  Further. None of the "ascendants" was in power; moreover 
they 
were persecuted, they were viewed as ODD BALLS, as completely "a 
breed apart," degraded and pushed aside in the same way... 
(Remember when V.V.Zh. shouted at a rally: "I am one of you!") 
And who does not suffer in a time of universal hard times... 
  All of them made the sweetest promises of any kind. All of 
them were like MESSIAHS. It would all come true, everything 
would be all right. If only...we come to power. 
  And you had better believe it! Rip out the tongues of the 
doubters. All of them are sent by the enemy, agents of 
imperialism, communism... Only boundless devotion and blind 
faith! No, they will not be saved by collective reason but a 
leader--a general secretary, Il Duce, der Fuehrer, the 
CHAIRMAN.... 
  The scenario is familiar, it has been studied, read and 
reread, it is printed in thousands of kilometers of artistic and 
documentary film--and on you: The hungry, Russian people have 
taken the live bait once again. 
  It is nauseating to talk about this. But necessary. 
<H5>  Whipping Up Fear </H5>
  "The country has been suppressed as a state--it has fallen 
to 
pieces, the economy has been plundered, the national question 
has been presented in the most distorted form: When Russians are 
protected, that is fascism, but when Russians are murdered or 
insulted and degraded--that is democracy. None of the 
ideologists of the past could have come up with such a monstrous 
lie. (Applause) There have been conflicts among 
states and among groups of states, but to cut into the Soviet 
Union so successfully, to place the accents so well that we are 
in a state of war, but there is no war. We are perishing, the 
population is decreasing, we are going hungry, we do not have 
enough medicine, there are no places for recreation, science is 
not developing, and the population is getting nervous, but there 
is no war... 
  "This is a well-considered large provocation of a worldwide 
nature. The Americans are the good guys. They have learned the 
mistakes of Bonaparte, the mistakes of Hitler and other 
conquerors of the West and the East who came to Russia with a 
sword and ultimately died by that sword. It is better to come to 
Russia with tights, with chewing gum, with McDonald's, with 
pornography, with horror films, and you will be welcomed. They 
will be glad to see you. The word 'dollar' will enter the 
child's consciousness, and instead of going to school he will be 
glad to take a rag and wash other people's cars in order to earn 
this green paper...." 
  "The country is in agony, the regime is perishing, the 
regime 
will leave the political stage and as it leaves, wounded, it 
will take as much as it can with it to the grave..." 
  "...The country is constantly in a state of covert civil 
war, 
on the threshold of more possible putsches, coups, and strains 
on the scale of the state...." 
<H5>  Russians--The Odd Men Out </H5>
  "And everything is done very efficiently, it is camouflaged, 
covered by pretty-sounding, correct slogans: 'democracy, law, 
justice, human rights'--but the result is expressed in that 
again the best part of society has been destroyed or cast aside. 
They dealt their main blow to the CPSU. This party and some of 
its leaders did indeed make enormous mistakes, but the CPSU 
during all the 70 years of the existence of that regime 
recruited the best of society, and therefore for us, for 
Russians, it was important for these best people to continue to 
work for the new Russia. But the blow was planned in such a way 
as not to give them a chance to work, having developed 
anticommunist propaganda, anti-Russian propaganda, because 
Russians made up the majority of Russia...." 
  "On the territory of the Soviet Union states were illegally 
created, states which had never before been on the political map 
of the world. In not a single historical reference work, in not 
a single encyclopedia could you ever find the name of such a 
state as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, etc. All this was 
territory of the Russian state." (Applause) 
  While the Lithuanians picked for themselves the year 1938 
and 
restored the 1938 Constitution, the Georgians liked 1921 and 
they chose it as the year that was best for the Georgian state, 
and in Central Asia they returned generally to the 14th and 15th 
centuries, we too have the right to determine for ourselves the 
point to which we will return so that there will be a point of 
departure, where the borders of Russia...." But let us recognize 
the borders of Russia, say, from the 13th century. 
<H5>  I Came To Bring You Happiness </H5>
  "...Our Fifth Congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia is a congress of winners. We have won not only within the 
framework of Russia, we have won on a worldwide scale. Never 
before in the history of mankind has there been a political 
party that has achieved such phenomenal success, never...." 
  Dear Vladimir Volfovich, that was enjoyed by Iosif 
Vissarionovich--the congress of winners. And the dear Ilich 
shouted in his guttural voice: "There is such a party!" You went 
too far regarding the victory too: You have not yet won in 
Russia (otherwise I would not be writing these lines, if I wrote 
them they would not be printed legally). That, excuse me, is 
nonsense, since a victory is a minimum of 51 percent in the 
State Duma, and you.... Well, you yourself know how many. So you 
can fool old auntie Dunya from Shchekov. But a victory on a 
worldwide scale.... Even Khlestakov himself would not have 
risked saying such a thing, in fear of being ridiculed, if only 
by Osip who was strictly a subordinate. 
  "We wanted these times of trouble to pass as quickly as 
possible, these times when our people are dying every day, every 
day if they are born they are frequently born sick and deformed. 
Millions of women of Russia are suffering to this day, to this 
day they are living poorly, they have no husbands, they have no 
children, they have no means of existence. Therefore our task is 
to save our women, daughters, sisters, our children, to create 
more realistic prospects for our grandchildren and not build 
castles in the air. We will be able to start to improve life 
during the first months after we come to power. During the first 
years, and if we had been given the nine years that were in the 
hands of other political forces, Russia would be a prosperous 
state today." (Applause) 
  Taught by the bitter historical experience of building the 
most just society, I now want to know not the final goal (it is 
the same for everyone) but the methods of achieving it. And 
V.V.Zh. game me an answer to the unasked question: 
  "We will put a stop to the genocide against the Russian 
people, against Russians and any other nationality, we will stop 
the collapse of the economy, we will make the borders peaceful, 
just, and legal and eternal." 
  And it was as though he drove the last nail into the coffin 
of the enemies of the Motherland: "Russia's historic mission is 
to save human civilization." As a citizen of Russia and a 
Russian as well, I am--for it. It is just that this phrase 
reminds me of another: "Deutschland Uber Alles!" 
  And here is another thing our half-Russian-half-lawyer-son 
promises us: "We will give you an assignment like children in 
school: Ladies and gentlemen, let us divide up the spheres of 
influence once and for all." And who will agree to a new 
repartition of the world right now? Is this "assignment" not an 
appeal for oppression of other peoples, will it not provoke 
tension? 
<H5>  We Say--Party, We Mean... </H5>
  Etc.--according to the well-known classical scenario of 
socialist realism. That is the way things went at the LDPR 
congress as well. 
  "I hope that you all understand quite well that the leader 
and the party are the same thing... (Applause) But 
you must understand that if the leader of the party, like a good 
helmsman on a ship, could steer this ship through the 
reefs...and we have no rivals near us...in order to keep a 
stronger hold on the wheel of this fighting ship farther through 
the expanses of ocean until we reach the port of victory with 
the word "president" above it, we must make it possible for the 
helmsman to hold this wheel more tightly." 
  "Therefore the party congresses will take place once every 
three years and the authority of the chairman of the party will 
be raised to the authority of the congress.... This is being 
done in order to promptly make a decision which previously, 
according to the regulations, could be made only at a party 
congress... 
  "Therefore in the new version of the regulations the party 
congress will elect only one elective organ--the chairman of the 
party. All the rest of the elective leadership organs and top 
leaders will be appointed by the party chairman..." 
  Where would this lead? Well, let dictatorship be 
dictatorship 
(or--authority, merits, etc.) but there must also be arguments 
for the doubters. They are very simple. 
  "All this is related to the democracy under which we are 
developing--when there is a gangster economy in the country, 
when all norms and constitutional rules are being flouted, when 
they fire at the parliament from tanks... Under these conditions 
of dictatorship, violence, and arbitrariness the LDPR has to 
exhibit a dictatorship of the party leader in order to break the 
resistance of forces that are hostile to the party...in order to 
definitely reach their final goal--to make the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia the ruling party...to form a 
one-party government and occupy the highest post of Russia--the 
post of head of state." 
  "Hostile forces"--that is quite Bolshevist, even Stalinist. 
And, of course, these forces are: the CIA, British Intelligence, 
the Mossad, the Germans, the Japanese--all of them, naturally, 
are pitted against "our party" to ruin it, to ruin its leader. 
And, of course, nothing will keep them from sending their 
agents. They do not name names but they hint at those 
"renegades" who recently tried to rebel against the leader who 
has overstepped his authority. 
  "...If we allow them to rise higher in the party hierarchy, 
obtain deputy mandates, go to the parliament, then they will 
begin to bare their fangs, to show that they are wolves in 
sheep's clothing...." 
  So stop talking nonsense, Ivanushka, sit there and be quiet, 
or you will turn into a beast... 
  And if this is how he talks to his fellow party members, 
those who believe as he does, what will he do if he comes to 
power along with people who think differently? 
<H5>  It Is a Terrible Weapon--Demagogy </H5>
  Like almost any other politician, V.V.Zh. resorts to devices 
of demagogy or else he simply makes things up. I have already 
mentioned his party's "victory" in the elections. But what kind 
of victory is it if, according to the complaints of V.V.Zh. 
himself, the LDPR is not now in a position to change anything: 
He says, give us power. 
  "We (meaning the LDPR--A.P.) are free because Russia has not 
attacked anyone in the 20th century, has not committed 
aggression. And if Russian and Soviet troops turned up 
somewhere, 90 percent was for real aid. They took preventive 
measures to save the civilian population from the threat of 
destruction that was hanging over their heads." 
  And there was no attack on Finland or Poland? And our troops 
were protecting "our interests" in the Baltics? And our 
"advisers" were not involved in Korea, etc.? 
  "There is no extremism in our party, no fanaticism. There 
has 
never been a single drop of blood, a single political action 
which would cause uneasiness in our society. The most peaceful 
rallies, the most peaceful news conferences, the most peaceful 
party congresses. Never once has anything happened." 
  And to call for redefining our borders, restoring them to 
what they were in 1975--is that not extremism? And the threat 
against the leaders of Estonia because of their Parteigenosse 
[party members]--is that not fanaticism? And the brawl between 
the deputy and the correspondent--is that "nothing" too? And the 
withdrawal of a whole group of deputies who were members of the 
LDPR from the faction, at which he himself even hinted at the 
congress?... 
  Like those who voted for V.V.Zh. and his party, I can admit 
that I am prepared to agree with certain of his statements. Yes, 
the "party program" is based on the backwardness of society. 
Yes, the present government itself could be sent into 
retirement. ("And the longer this inept government remains in 
power, the more votes our party will receive in all subsequent 
elections.") But even with these points of contact I would never 
vote for V.V.Zh. and the LDPR. Since it is quite obvious to me 
(and this can be seen from V.V.Zh.'s speech at the congress) 
that the party's goal is to seize power, and not in defense of 
the interests of the people. 
  And regardless of how mixed the "people" may be, they have 
one common desire--to pass through the mine field of reform 
without shock waves. The heirs of the totalitarian Fuehrers will 
not give us this guarantee. On the contrary. The danger from 
them is much more real than the one from imported tights and 
chewing gum...

  [Text] The Russian opposition is striving for solidarity 
and unity of action. That is how one might describe the main 
idea of the three significant assemblies of political leaders 
and the public that took place in Moscow on 16, 17, and 18 April. 
  The strengthening of the position of the Union of Officers 
explains not only its congress but also the direct participation 
in the congress of the Russian Great Power Party and the 
constituent conference of the Public Committee for Legality and 
Popular Rule of many representatives from regional divisions of 
this organization. 
  The documents and resolutions of the congresses earmark 
actively influencing the political life of Russia, and the 
Declaration of the Public Committee discusses the need to 
protect the rights of citizens of Russia from any forms of 
violence and discrimination. 
  The leader of the Union of Officers, Stanislav Terekhov, was 
elected chairman of the Russian Great Power Party. 
  The Public Committee for Legality and Popular Rule was 
headed 
by State Duma Deputy Yuriy Vlasov. 
  Participating in the work of the congresses and conferences 
were S. Baburin, V. Ilyukhin, V. Isakov, E. Volodin, and a 
number of key politicians of the Russian opposition movement.

<F P=106> [Article by Alexander Zhilin: "Union of Officers Changes Its </F>
Tactics"; first paragraph MOSCOW NEWS comment] 
  [Text] On April 16, the Union of Officers (UO) held its 
regular congress at the Lesnoi Gorodok boarding house near 
Moscow in secret. This was the organization's first full 
gathering after the October events of last year when its leader, 
Stanislav Terekhov, was arrested. 
  The high officer assembly was honored with the presence of 
prominent representatives from nearly all opposition forces: 
Iona Andronov, Alexander Barkashov, Sergei Baburin, Yuri Vlasov, 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Sazhi Umalatova and Alexander Sterligov. 
Conspicuously absent was Gennady Zyuganov, whom speakers accused 
of "treacherous collaboration with the anti-people regime." A 
full share of criticism was also heaped on Alexander Rutskoi and 
Ruslan Khasbulatov who had "given up further struggle." 
  The main item on the agenda was, of course, the situation in 
the country and the tasks of the Union of Officers. However, 
Stanislav Terekhov devoted a large part of his report to 
analyzing the reasons for the opposition's defeat last October. 
It is significant that the UO leader complemented the attacks 
against Rutskoy and Khasbulatov by referring to the "poor 
agitation-propaganda work" in the troops. Thus, the UO's 
traditional tasks--to "propagate the spirit of patriotism" and 
to strengthen "loyalty to the Soviet oath of allegiance"--were 
complemented with new ones. Activists were prescribed "to 
identify among officers those who are ready to carry out 
criminal orders for money and use arms against their own 
people," and also to set up "groups of emergency leadership" for 
the eventuality of the inner political situation taking a turn 
for the worse. 
  Essentially, the question is that the Union of Officers 
intends to build a network of military-political structures in 
the power ministries not only in Russia, but in the other former 
republics of the USSR. It has been envisaged, moreover, that 
they will be rigidly controlled by Moscow. The guests who had 
arrived at the congress from similar organizations in Belarus, 
Ukraine, Trans-Dniestria, Moldova, Crimea and Kazakhstan voiced 
their readiness to transform missions of the Union of Officers 
into republican institutions and actively join in the 
restoration of Soviet power in all the republics of "the USSR 
which has been ruined but not destroyed." 
  It is common knowledge that the Union of Officers holds 
strong positions in the central apparat of the defense 
ministries of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and in Russian 
military academies, including the General Staff Academy. The UO 
leaders make no secret of the fact that they receive prompt 
information on what is going on in the top echelons, including 
that from top-secret documents. 
  "The entire anti-Grachev opposition at the RF Ministry of 
Defense is ready to cooperate with the Union of Officers," the 
MN correspondent was told by a major-general, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. His confidence is based on the 
assumption that officers' discontent with the present leadership 
of the Defense Ministry is being fuelled with mounting 
suspicions of corruption. "We actively collect compromising 
documents bearing witness to financial-material crimes," the 
major-general admitted, "to make them public at the right moment 
and introduce a split between the group of generals waxing fat 
and the officer corps being impoverished." In conditions when 
army officers do not get their pay for three months, the stake 
on their discontent is a sure winner. 
  It is significant that present at the congress were not only 
students of military academies, but also generals of the Defense 
Ministry and unit commanders who were not afraid to come in 
military uniform. It is possible that this happened because 
there were no TV reporters at the congress. 
  Admitting that after the October events the Union of 
Officers 
was "in comatose state," the delegates approved the actions of 
Terekhov, who had "called to account those who were 
shilly-shally at the period of his arrest," carried out 
personnel replacements and established firm discipline in the 
organization on the basis of one-man command. However, from now 
on the Union of Officers intends to be more wary in its actions. 
Terekhov never tired to repeat that "today the forces are not 
equal, which is why everything possible must be done to prevent 
a direct clash with the regime which is looking for a pretext 
for forcibly crushing its opponents." Not fearing being reputed 
for being banal, the UO leader told his comrades-in-arms that, 
according to his information, the authorities were preparing 
provocations on May 1 and 9 to impose a state of emergency on 
the country. 
  The following day, the officers created the Russian State 
Party (RSP). The leaders of the UO stressed that the RSP was not 
a subsidiary of their association and not a parallel structure, 
but its main mission was "to cater to the political interests of 
the Union of Officers." Another objective is to show that UO 
members are not "extremists" but "political leaders." According 
to Terekhov's words, the RSP must, with the use of permitted 
methods, "bring to power those committed to the state." Terekhov 
did not rule out that the party would nominate its candidate at 
the coming elections. 
  Representatives from the "patriotic" opposition did not 
attend the RSP congress. True, the day before Yuri Vlasov said 
that "the people are looking forward to a party in which they 
will believe and which they will follow." Sergei Baburin wished 
the RSP success in its joint work with the Russian All-People 
Union, and Zhirinovsky vowed friendship to the Union of Officers 
and transparently advised: "If all of a sudden you are unable to 
nominate your candidate at the presidential elections, it is 
important to find your bearings in time..." It is evident that 
the patriots took a cautious stand towards the formation of a 
new party, seeing it as a "competing firm." The patriotic 
electorate has already been divided and the emergence of a new 
organization may alter the balance of forces. To prevent this, 
the veterans of patriotism want to have the officers as their 
allies. 
  MN file 
  The Union of Officers was formed at the end of 1991. 
The purpose of the formation is "to assist the cohesion of 
officers on state-patriotic ideas." As seen by analysts, the 
Union is one of the most radical factions in the country. Its 
followers fought in the wars in Karabakh, Abkhazia and Serbia. 
There is no accurate information about the UO's real forces and 
influence. However, on the eve of the October events, the UO 
leader, Stanislav Terekhov, said that if needed, he could have 
as many as 25,000 men under arms. The Union has 47 regional 
departments in practically all the republics of the former 
USSR, including the Baltics. It belongs as a collective member 
to the National Salvation Front. The UO's Chairman is Stanislav 
Terekhov. He was born in 1953 in Moscow. In 1976, he graduated 
from the Leningrad Higher Military-Political School of the Air 
Defense Forces. He served in Siberia, the Trans-Baikal Area and 
in the Russian Far East. In 1987, he entered the Lenin 
Military-Political Academy (now the Humanitarian Academy). From 
1990--he was a postgraduate of the chair of law.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Afanasyev: "`Stage-by-Stage </F>
Constitutional Reform' as a Way of Life"] 
  [Text] Unless we adopt immediate measures for legal 
and economic support, local self-government will soon cease to 
exist as an independent institution. 
  Is it not strange: The Constitution has been adopted, the 
president in his message to the Federal Assembly defined the 
main task as unwavering observance of the Constitution and the 
most rapid adoption of the laws envisioned in it, and throughout 
Russia more and more documents are being produced concerning the 
organization of state power and local self-government in which 
the formula from the October presidential edicts is repeated: 
"for the period of stage-by-stage constitutional reform." 
Knowing regional norm-setting, we are convinced that many local 
leaders apparently think that to mouth this formula which has 
lost its meaning will release them from the obligation to 
observe the Constitution. 
  The Russian bureaucracy is used to transition periods. 
Actually they know only two forms of existence: transition 
periods and stagnation. So we have known quite well for a long 
time: If the leadership has been defined--there will soon be 
stagnation; if they have started speaking about a transition 
period--a redistribution of power is in progress. 
<H5>  Cheap Legislation </H5>
  With one of his October edicts the president defined the 
foundations for the organization of state power in the Russian 
regions: The administration manages and gives orders; the 
representative assembly legislates and oversees the 
implementation of laws, execution of the budget, and the 
disposal of state property. The only unusual norm was the 
restriction of the number of personnel of the regional 
legislative assembly--no more than 50 deputies. In general the 
Constitution establishes that components of the Russian 
Federation shall determine the system of their state organs 
independently in keeping with the fundamentals of the 
constitutional system and general principles for the 
organization of representative and executive organs of state 
power established by federal laws. The establishment of these 
general principles by presidential edicts is not envisioned by 
the Constitution and, moreover, there is no way you can call the 
number of positions in regional representative assemblies a 
general principle. In spite of this, the next edict for organs 
of state power in the regions, which came out on 22 
December--that is, under the existing Constitution--after 
limiting the overall number of representative assemblies, also 
limited the number of deputies working on a paid staff 
basis--this number must not exceed two-fifths of the overall 
number of elected deputies. Here the edicts contradicted not 
only the Constitution but also themselves. Because here is what 
we have: First it was established that the representative organ 
(note, organ, that is, assembly and not any group of deputies) 
performs its activity on a permanent basis, but in the next 
paragraph it is written that no more than two-fifths of the 
personnel of the assembly shall work on a staff basis! 
  Behind this absurdity lies something of quite distinct and 
great interest. Thus managers of enterprises and officials of 
administrative organs have been given an opportunity to 
legislate while holding more than one position. This is why the 
prohibition on combining the deputy status with a state position 
and entrepreneurial activity in all regional normative documents 
extends only to representatives working on a staff basis. As 
though the problem is not one of monopolization of power and 
unrestricted lobbying but simply of allowing people to draw 
wages from two positions! We must also keep in mind that the 
number of representatives professionally engaged in legislative 
work is being limited precisely at a time when the new 
representative organs for the first time in Russian history will 
have to create legislation of the krays and oblasts and reform 
their system of state power and local self-government. And it is 
obvious that this work cannot be performed on a public basis 
during short visits. Though this work will actually be taken on 
by the staff, and the legislators who are combining jobs, 
instead of professional legislative and supervisory activity, 
will concentrate on solving their own production and personal 
problems and lobbying for particular interests. Who said there 
was uncivilized lobbying in Russia? On the contrary, ours is 
organized by the state. 
  As we know, the "party in power" had a shattering victory in 
the local elections. Apparently we cannot expect the new 
legislative assemblies, the majority of which are 
representatives of the director-chairman corps and subordinate 
to the head of the regional administration of bureaucrats, to 
establish civilized principles and restrictions on professional 
representative activity. Of course, such principles could be 
legislatively established by the State Duma, but our all-Russian 
legislators, it seems, are completely absorbed by the Yugoslav 
crisis. 
<H5>  A Mixture of the General-Governor System and the Presidency </H5>
  The nomenklatura is the nomenklatura, but any representative 
(and also legislative) assembly is for the staff a source of 
uneasiness, inconvenience, and irritation. Because just as soon 
as they have determined who has all the power--it begins all 
over again...in this situation how can one resist the temptation 
to prolong the transition period, to drag out the stages of 
"constitutional reform." Or, before the transition period has 
ended, manage to adopt the most permanent Law, Regulation, 
Constitution that there is. To write a correct and convenient 
Regulation and ask the people to approve it. This is what they 
have done in many krays and oblasts--they have scheduled 
simultaneously with elections to legislative assemblies 
referendums on the adoption of regulations written in the 
staffs. One thing is bad: According to the Russian Constitution 
a representative assembly must adopt the Constitution and 
regulations of a component of the Russian Federation. The 
president abolished the regional referendums at the last moment. 
How well this was thought out and prepared for! 
  For example, the draft of the regulations of Vologda Oblast 
stipulates that the authority of the owner of oblast property is 
exercised by the executive power, but there is a discrete 
silence about overseeing the disposal of oblast property by the 
representative assembly, so that the staff establishes and uses 
nonbudget funds without any oversight. The duty of being the 
collective administrative property owner is assigned to the 
governor--the highest official of the oblast. This individual is 
elected by the population for four years. The present chief of 
the oblast administration, N. Podgornov, becomes governor 
automatically, without elections--this was stipulated, but 
nothing was said about when the gubernatorial elections would 
take place. The president appointed N. Podgornov as chief of the 
administration, but the regulations say nothing about whether or 
not the president may remove Governor N. Podgornov, whom nobody 
elected as governor. In general the draft is extremely brief, 
wherein lies its genius. Of course, in the oblast Duma there 
will certainly be people willing to add something, but this too 
has been envisioned: There is a special decree prohibiting the 
Duma from revising articles of the regulation that pertain to 
the authority of the owner of oblast property and the 
organization of power. 
  The draft of the regulations of Saratov Oblast, unlike 
Vologda's, cannot be called laconic--it contains a detailed list 
of subjects, objects, and concerns of the oblast administration. 
In order to avoid seeming insufficient it lists the authority of 
the oblast power with respect to the objects of federal and 
municipal property. Is there really any need to say anything 
about the fact that all the authority of the property owner 
belongs to the staff? The only mention of a representative 
assembly amounts to saying that this assembly exists. Why it 
exists, true, is completely incomprehensible--the staff itself 
establishes the oblast taxes, it establishes its own budget and 
report on its execution, and it adopts legal normative acts 
itself. In general, it is clear who is the master of the oblast. 
But what a master! Read this with envy: "The citizens shall 
utilize natural objects free of charge (forests, rivers, lakes, 
roads, and other natural objects)..." This is not some kind of 
land owner who will not let you swim in his stream--it is 
written: "free of charge"! In addition to the fact that the 
staff protects the population from the market, it patronizes the 
arts and sciences, "establishes plan-programs for public 
education," supports a "healthy way of life" and "kinds of 
sports that are traditional in the oblast." Since only a lunatic 
would reject regulations like these, in Article 106 "the effect 
of the regulations in time and in terms of individuals" 
stipulates that its norms "are in effect without restriction in 
time" and apply to citizens residing in the oblast and 
"transiting through it." Other oblasts have things to be proud 
of, but they are a long ways away from the Saratov draft--this 
monument will probably go down in the history of Russian 
bureaucratic thought. I would suggest that they publish it as an 
appendix to Shchedrin's "History of One City." 
<H5>  Local Self-Government: Reform or Counterreform? </H5>
  A typical feature of the present "transition period" is the 
re-bureaucratization of local self-government. From the 
president's edicts "On Reform of Local Self-Government in the 
Russian Federation" of 26 October 1993 and "On Guarantees of 
Local Self-Government in the Russian Federation" of 22 December 
1993 it follows that the current administration chiefs will 
become the chiefs of local self-government--they convene and 
lead the work of the representative organ, sign its resolutions, 
and even unilaterally give consent to fire a deputy from his 
job. Moreover, it is stipulated that not only the chiefs but 
also other officials of the local administration may be members 
of the corresponding representative organ. The representative 
organ itself is given a minimum of authority: to adopt the local 
regulations (but the administration chief has the right, 
bypassing the assembly, to place the draft regulations on a 
local referendum); to approve a program for development; at the 
suggestion of the chief, to establish local taxes, and approve 
the budget and then the report on its execution. Thus the 
representative organ is completely without rights--it is 
convened by the chief of the administration to document his 
decisions and it consists of individuals who are independent of 
him but at the same time directly subordinate to him. Thus there 
can be no real supervision of the administration--the chiefs of 
the local administrations, having concentrated the local power 
in their hands, are not responsible either to the population or 
to its representatives. 
  It is not surprising that the possibility contained in the 
president's edicts of not electing but appointing heads of 
administrations, in the majority of regional normative acts, has 
been turned into an unequivocal norm concerning the appointment 
of local chiefs by the higher chief of local 
self-administration, and in the rayons and cities--by the chief 
of the state power of the component of the Russian Federation. 
The Ulyanov and Saratov governors even want to appoint the 
chiefs of the rayon administrations in the oblast centers. It is 
understandable that the restoration of the administrative 
vertical under conditions of conflicts over division of property 
and taxes will lead to a blocking of the separation of local 
self-government from regional administrative systems which has 
just begun and to the "punishment" of excessively independent 
local leaders--most frequently the mayors of cities. The crises 
of power in Vladivostok and Nizhniy Novgorod are only the most 
blatant of a number of similar conflicts. 
  In many regions it is being proposed to form representative 
assemblies in the rayon or rural soviet from the appointed rural 
and village chiefs of local self-government--this is not a 
representative organ but an administrative collegium under the 
chief of the administration. They were not satisfied with this 
in Ulyanovsk Oblast and established that, in addition, all the 
assemblies of representatives would include, without any 
elections to these positions, not only the chiefs of the 
corresponding administrations, but also their deputies. Vologda 
Oblast has been left with only two elective organs of local 
self-government--city dumas in Vologda and Cherepovets, and 
local self-government has been abolished in the ancient Russian 
cities of Totma, Belozersk, Velikiy Ustyug, Kirillov, and 
Ustyuzhna. 
  An analysis of the normative documents and their drafts in 
the components of the Russian Federation makes it possible to 
single out three groups of regions: 1) regions in which they 
limit themselves to reproducing provisions of presidential 
edicts; 2) regions where the re-bureaucratization of local 
self-government is proceeding on a broader scale (leading in 
this movement are Vologda, Volgograd, Saratov, and Ulyanovsk 
Oblasts); 3) a group of regions (Karelia, Khakassia, Krasnoyarsk 
Kray, and Belgorod, Kursk, Nizhniy Novgorod, Omsk, and Tambov 
Oblast) where attempts to create a civilized local 
self-government have not yet been abandoned. 
  It should be kept in mind that the most powerful, 
independent, and skilled forces of local self-government are 
concentrated in the cities and their alliances, but it is 
precisely the activists of city local self-government who have 
now ended up in an extremely difficult position. On the one 
hand, the provincial authorities are trying to take the cities 
back into their own complete control and overthrow their 
self-administration and, on the other, the populations of the 
cities themselves have essentially boycotted elections, as a 
result of which many Russian cities have been left, in the first 
place, without representative organs of self-government and, in 
the second place, underrepresented (and in some places not 
represented at all) in regional legislative assemblies. Unless 
immediate measures are adopted for legal and economic support, 
local self-government in Russia will soon cease to exist as an 
independent institution. Of course, we are more used to going 
without self-government. But here is the problem--we no longer 
respect or fear our leaders. If we do not want to elect our 
leaders and thus take responsibility for our choice--who can we 
blame? In turn, the lack of participation of the population in 
the exercise of local power and the placing of all 
responsibility on chiefs appointed "from above" exacerbates the 
sociopsychological and political alienation. This growing 
alienation, this fundamental lack of civic pride in our society, 
is our main social danger.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mukhammat Sabirov, prime minister of </F>
Tatarstan, by TATAR-INFORM correspondent Zhanna Khidiatullina; 
place and date not given: "'Our Salvation Is in Our Own Hands'"] 
  [Text] The 19th Session of the Supreme Soviet of the 
Republic of Tatarstan voted the budget of the Republic of 
Tatarstan on condition that a program for extricating the 
republic's economy from crisis be presented for consideration 
prior to 30 May. A correspondent of the TATAR-INFORM Agency 
asked Mukhammat Sabirov, prime minister of Tatarstan, to 
describe how the government will in so short a space of time 
prepare for discussion at a special session of the Supreme 
Soviet a document that will possibly determine the future course 
of the republic's economic development. 
  [Khidiatullina] The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of 
Tatarstan is working on an anticrisis program. Is the situation 
in the economy that serious? 
  [Sabirov] Perhaps we have not been all that successful in 
our 
choice of terms. I would not say that our economy is in a crisis 
phase. Of course, many enterprises are approaching this, but 
there is a whole number of sectors that are developing perfectly 
normally. Nonetheless, as of the start of 1994 the situation has 
been getting more acute by the month. 
  It cannot be forgotten that the integration of Tatarstan's 
economy in that of Russia is so strong that we cannot fail to 
experience all its fluctuations. We have powers sufficient 
merely for influencing the speed and abruptness of these 
changes. I refer primarily to the situation that has taken shape 
on account of the mutual arrears. M. Shaymiyev, president of the 
Republic of Tatarstan, and members of the Cabinet of Ministers 
of Tatarstan have since last year been trying to persuade the 
leadership of the Russian Federation to agree to mutual offsets. 
This can in no way be called a market measure, of course, but 
nor has Moscow thought up any other solution as yet. And 
everyone has become a debtor in this time. Even those that are 
working and selling their products without interruption. The 
Tatneft Association has been forced to lay people off and send 
them on administrative leave because there is nothing with which 
to pay them. This huge enterprise cannot obtain the R400 billion 
it has earned. Reciprocal debts between enterprises of Tatarstan 
and Russia now constitute approximately R2 trillion. 
  Several days ago I traveled to rural areas of the republic. 
There are farms on which people have not been paid since 
November! 
  Many people are applying to the banks for loans. You are 
well 
aware of the rate--21 percent and higher. If their repayment 
times are missed, the amount doubles. The enterprises are, 
understandably, embedding these charges in production costs--a 
well-known chain! And there are some organizations and small 
plants that are already being refused credit (the banks fear for 
their money also), and the former, having spent up their working 
assets, are starting to eat through their fixed capital. 
  We are in a position to support only firms manufacturing 
products which the republic needs. We will do this regardless of 
forms of ownership of the enterprises. 
  Some of them will be deemed insolvent, but what is to be 
done? Tatarstan cannot resolve this problem alone. Particularly 
when it is a question of plants of the former 
military-industrial complex. It is splendid, of course, that 
virtually no weapons are being produced by our hands now, but 
these enormous machine tools which manufactured aircraft wings 
or the hulls of warships are not ready for the manufacture of 
flat-irons or washing machines. How to provide work for 160,000 
persons who, following every conceivable reduction, remain at 
these plants? We are managing to do some things. The 
construction of a tanker fleet will ensure long-term orders for 
the Gorkiy Plant in Zelenodolsk, helicopters of our specialized 
association enjoy continued demand, and the Kazan Aviation Plant 
has called and announced that, aside from the Tu-204, there is a 
decree of the Government of the Russian Federation on the 
placement of orders for the new Tu-330 cargo plane carrying 
20-30 tonnes. But such enterprises as the Lenin 
Science-Production Association cannot, whichever way they turn, 
making linoleum and artificial leather, resolve the problems of 
conversion. It is essential that Russia begin to fulfill its 
obligations identified in the treaty and intergovernmental 
agreements. But, despite all our efforts, we have been unable as 
yet to adopt the necessary measures. 
  [Khidiatullina] So an operational program of the solution of 
Tatarstan's problems is essential? 
  [Sabirov] Undoubtedly, but everything must be done to ensure 
that this program work with a view to the future. Only a madman 
could dream of a return to the past, but we have not really 
attempted to ponder in earnest what precisely the economic 
system in our country might look like. Work has been under way 
in the Cabinet of Ministers for a year now, it is true, on the 
"Guidelines of the Economic and Social Development of the 
Republic of Tatarstan Corresponding to the New Constitution of 
the Republic of Tatarstan." Scientists, economists, and 
practical experts have been taking part. The draft has already 
been prepared. Foreign specialists are conducting an expert 
appraisal of it at this time. Together with the Constitution of 
the Republic of Tatarstan, the treaty between Russia and 
Tatarstan, and the government program, it will be the basis of 
the program of stabilization of the economy of the Republic of 
Tatarstan that is being devised at this time. The main aim is to 
ensure that any development of events have as little affect on 
our people as possible. We are studying the economic situation 
of many countries and borrowing the positive experience of 
Germany, Hungary, and Turkey. But none of these states can 
suggest specific solutions for us. For example, Turkey's private 
enterprises are working excellently, and their product is 
competitive. But we cannot fail to be alerted by the rate of 
inflation and the appearance of large masses of impoverished 
people here. We must blaze our own trail. 
  [Khidiatullina] How is the work on the document that will be 
offered for discussion by the deputies of the Supreme Soviet of 
Tatarstan going in practice? 
  [Sabirov] All ministries and departments are drawing up 
their 
proposals at this time. Every five days members of the 
government meet to discuss the progress of the accomplishment of 
this important task. We had been prepared to consider several 
alternative versions, but when we began to listen to the 
proposals of the ministers and deputy prime ministers, we 
realized that there were no sharp disagreements. Everyone, 
generally, sees the goal identically. Differences arise during 
discussion of the tactics of its achievement. 
  [Khidiatullina] This is strange. A few days ago Ravil 
Muratov, deputy prime minister of the Republic of Tatarstan, 
speaking at a news conference, complained that the number of 
conservatives surrounding the prime minister was inordinate.... 
  [Sabirov] It is possible that this opinion emerged because 
everyone was engaged in the solution of problems of his own 
department or sector. We had never exchanged opinions on 
strategic matters so candidly before. Now, after several such 
meetings and frank exchanges of opinion, we have succeeded in 
bringing our positions closer together. This is easily checked, 
incidentally, because there are verbatim records of all the 
sessions. All agreed on the need for the adoption of 
well-considered decisions. And I cannot accuse any member of the 
Cabinet of Ministers of any opposition. 
  The program will incorporate a whole number of practical 
measures. In addition, we are formulating a mechanism of its 
implementation--enforceable enactments and draft laws and 
edicts. Adopting another declaration would be a waste of time. I 
allow of the possibility of the Supreme Soviet granting the 
president special powers, in accordance with which his edicts 
would have the force of law, for the time of realization of this 
document. Adopting operational decisions and energetic measures 
is impossible without this. 
  The State Committee for Economics and Forecasting has been 
entrusted with collating the proposals of all departments. Its 
chairman, Filza Khamidullin, has been relieved of all current 
business and has the right to enlist any specialist of the 
republic in this work. A rough version of the consolidated 
program will be ready by 16 May, and after the amendments--20 
May--it will be presented to the president and the chairman of 
the Supreme Soviet. All the valuable suggestions of the foreign 
experts will have been inserted in it before 25 May. Although, 
granted all my respect for them, I am convinced that our 
salvation lies in our own hands. 
  [Khidiatullina] Will you have completed all the work by 30 
May, it is a painfully tight time scale. 
  [Sabirov] Had the Cabinet of Ministers not thus far been 
working for, I repeat, almost a year, on a solution of the 
problem, doing this in haste, in a matter of days, would be 
impossible. But I am now confident that the deputies will on 30 
May begin discussion of the program of stabilization of the 
economy of Tatarstan.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Kolotvin, deputy chief of the Regional </F>
Office for Organized Crime, by S. Baranov; place and date not 
given: "Fifty Mafia Groups for the Kray. And a `Syndicate' To 
Boot"] 
  [Text] Just a few years ago even the question of 
whether there was organized crime here in the kray was being 
discussed in the press by way of a debate. Today no one has any 
doubt as to the presence of organized crime groups: They exist. 
As does now also a force opposed to them--the Regional Office 
for Organized Crime. Formed two years ago, this MVD subdivision 
is showing itself to be increasingly decisive. The work on 
countering the mafia crime formations in our kray is headed by 
Yuriy Kolotvin, deputy chief of this office. 
  [Baranov] So what is organized crime in the kray today? 
  [Kolotvin] Insofar as the legislators have yet to give us 
precise legal criteria of a definition of the "organized crime" 
concept, we have had to formulate them ourselves. As distinct 
from the customary criminal groupings, so to speak, 
organized-crime communities have to have been in existence for 
quite some time and to have quite a clear-cut structure of the 
chain of command, intelligence, outlets to the organs of 
administration and the law enforcement authorities, and legal or 
semilegal forms of "laundering" money obtained illegally. 
  On the basis of these estimates, we count in the kray today 
one criminal community--the "syndicate"--and 46 organized-crime 
groups. Those formed on a national basis included. They include 
three Azerbaijani, two Armenian, two Chechen, and two Korean 
crime groups. But I have to specify immediately that both 
quantitatively and qualitatively the composition of the groups 
is changing constantly. Last year, for example, two Azerbaijani 
groupings were locked in a mortal clash. Nine persons on both 
sides died as a result. Some of the groups, having been brought 
under our control, are disbanding themselves. 
  We "fish out" some, so to speak, in actual crimes and 
institute criminal proceedings against them. Thus two crime 
bosses and 35 leaders of various criminal groups were arraigned 
last year on the basis of material of our officers. As a result 
we were able to prevent the misappropriation of monetary 
resources totaling R5.5 billion and the attempted sale of almost 
10 kg of industrial silver, to detect and confiscate R2 million 
worth of counterfeit R5,000 notes and $4,000 worth in $100 
bills, and to confiscate from the criminals 51 firearms and 35 
kg of narcotics. 
  [Baranov] But does not your subdivision duplicate the work 
of 
other militia services, criminal investigation, say? 
  [Kolotvin] I do not believe so. Although there are many 
problems that we have to resolve together. 
  The point is that organized crime, availing itself of the 
new 
social opportunities, is rapidly invading all spheres of the 
economic and social life of society and mastering increasingly 
new types of crime, for which the Criminal Code has no name 
even. Thus are "dead zones," at which the militia branch 
services either cannot call in time or at which they cannot call 
at all, are emerging. Our officers employ in their work both the 
principle of the work of criminal investigation--from the crime 
to the person--and the principle of work of the economic crime 
subdivisions--from the person to the crime. It is the 
combination of these two principles that is enabling us to [word 
illegible] and, if not wipe out, then keep under control these 
"dead zones." 
  This was the case with, for example, forged letters of 
advice, owing to the use of which in the Far East region 
approximately R3 billion were lost. As soon as we learned about 
this, we made a careful study of the forms and paths of the 
embezzlement of the money and performed a colossal amount of 
work on detecting the enterprises that had been specially formed 
to this end. Twenty-seven of them were discovered in Khabarovsk 
alone, incidentally, and this made it possible not only to save 
over R5 billion for the kray but also to erect quite dependable 
barriers in the way of the transfer of monetary resources. 
  [Baranov] Does this mean that you are having today to deal 
more with crimes in the economic sphere? 
  [Kolotvin] Such a tilt has, indeed, emerged, but this is 
dictated more by the criminalization of our economy. The public 
sector has one foot in the grave, virtually. It has come to be 
replaced by a variety of limited-liability partnerships, 
associations, individual-private enterprises, and joint 
ventures, many of which are in practice merely a cover for 
illegal activity and the laundering of criminal cash. Thus last 
year the Komsomolsk-na-Amure branch of the Office for Organized 
Crime uncovered the theft by a number of officials and the 
commander of a military unit of military assets, provisions, and 
explosives worth a total of over R18 million. It has now already 
been established that everything that was misappropriated was 
sold via commercial structures controlled by the "syndicate." At 
a warehouse of the Tatyana individual-private enterprise our 
officers confiscated more than 200 kg of TNT demolition blocks, 
approximately 100 detonators, and 70 meters of safety fuse. A 
group of embezzlers at the shipbuilding yard was discovered 
there, in Komsomolsk, also. In exchange for consumer merchandise 
it has given Japan ultra-pure copper intended for military 
production. And these transactions were effected via the Yeva 
commercial enterprise. We were able to prevent the removal of 
the last consignment of copper (six tonnes). In a word, certain 
commercial structures require today the constant and unremitting 
attention of the militia authorities, ours included. But the 
economy far from exhausts the spheres of our attention, of 
course. 
  [Baranov] To what else do you pay attention? 
  [Kolotvin] Take racketeering. Given the imperfect state of 
Russian criminal legislation, extortion has become the favorite 
form of shaking loose money for our organized-crime groups. It 
is more profitable for organized crime than the traditional 
business--prostitution, gambling, narcotics. 
  Strapping young men approach a businessman and offer him 
so-called "protection." And although, as a rule, there are 
neither direct threats nor other physical pressure--only hints 
at possible dangers--such offers are accepted practically 
without a hitch. And this type of "activity" brings in enormous 
profits, effortlessly, what is more. Were the payers to see, 
willy-nilly, what tears are shed by their "protectors" whom we 
have taken into custody, they would not be giving up their money 
so easily. But fear in the face of the extortioners is so great 
that the victims of regular racketeering prefer to conceal 
themselves, are driving their problems inward, and are, 
ultimately, drawing even bigger trouble onto themselves. 
  Quite recently we were involved in a case of a businessman 
who had been "held" for almost a week and who, possibly, had 
been subjected to physical pressure in the gym of the Rossich 
Club, which had hitherto been classed with us as being in far 
from criminal ranks. It was demanded of the businessman that he 
return R24 million which he allegedly owed. Closer 
familiarization with the records of the Rossich Club, 
incidentally, affords reason to believe that its members have 
not eschewed concealed forms of racketeering either. Why, in 
fact, have numerous commercial firms suddenly become enamored 
with sport, that cultivated by Rossich, what is more, and begun 
to transfer millions in assets to the club's account? 
  Generally, fear, far-fetched, for the most part, is enabling 
a variety of no-good people to prosper. Although whoever has, 
for all that, ventured to turn to us has not yet once regretted 
it. 
  [Baranov] It is hard to believe. After all, organized crime 
is, you will agree, far from innocuous.... 
  [Kolotvin] This is true. But there is real danger and there 
is a mythical danger spurred more by the representatives of the 
criminal communities themselves, who make money out of general 
fear. But it is a very great distance from threats to their 
actual realization. We know this better than anyone. Especially 
since we are today capable of providing perfectly dependable 
protection for people who have turned to us for help. And there 
have been no malfunctions as yet. It is not fortuitous that the 
"syndicate" and organizations under its control are now trying 
to resort more to psychological methods, via the news media 
included. Many citizens of Khabarovsk most likely witnessed what 
strong words against the militia on the TVA [expansion 
unidentified] screen were uttered by Sergeyev, chairman of the 
Yedinstvo public organization, when we made public facts about 
the past of the leaders of this organization. 
  It never occurred to any of our officers or officers of the 
Internal Affairs Administration, incidentally, to appear on TVA 
and if only somehow to restrict the flow of Yedinstvo's 
protests. We believed and continue to believe that this is 
exclusively the business of the staff of the television station. 
That at least three members of Yedinstvo are at the present time 
under arrest for perfectly specific crimes is another matter. 
And they were arrested before Yedinstvo's television attack, 
what is more. 
  One way or another, we understand full well that we are 
constantly in the sights of criminal structures and that any 
misstep of ours, any mistake--and our officers are human, for 
all that--could immediately be presented in a distorted form. So 
we try to make as few mistakes as possible. 
  [Baranov] Since we are talking about employees of your 
office, what are things like for them today? 
  [Kolotvin] Thanks to the assistance of the kray Internal 
Affairs Administration, our outfit has been noticeably 
reinforced. We now have subdivisions in Sovetskaya Gavan and 
Vanino, in Amursk and Nikolayevsk. Special rapid-deployment 
subdivisions are being formed in Khabarovsk and in Komsomolsk. 
Our office has, in accordance with a decision of the 
administration of the kray, been allocated premises. And 
although they do not entirely resolve the problem of 
accommodating our officers, they are, for all that, better than 
nothing. We will hope that the social problems of the personnel 
of the Office for Organized Crime will be resolved. 
  Social problems, on which unfortunately we can exert no in 
any way appreciable influence, disturb us no less than our own, 
for that matter. The problem of the youth, primarily. 
  We are noting with alarm organized crime's vigorous 
penetration of the youth milieu. Having a criminal record and 
wearing the badges of affiliation to the criminal world are 
today considered among certain young people the height of valor, 
virtually. Last year the Komsomolsk "syndicate" even attempted 
to demonstrate its youth strength, organizing a protest action 
in connection with the militia's arrest of crime boss Turbin. 
Only thanks to the decisive and prompt measures of the 
leadership of the Komsomolsk Internal Affairs Administration was 
this action thwarted. But who could vouch under the conditions 
of the present social instability, inflation, and rising 
unemployment for the criminal world not tomorrow parading not 
hundreds but thousands of its new recruits? 
  Another serious problem is corruption. It is increasingly 
encompassing the authorities, the business leadership, and the 
militia and other law enforcement authorities. Senior officials 
and the criminal communities are coalescing in the soil of 
corruption. And although we already have considerable material 
on a number of officials, on account of the absence of 
legislation on corruption, we can use only that which comes 
under articles of the current Criminal Code. 
  This year, for example, we have succeeded in instituting two 
such sets of criminal proceedings: on the criminal collaboration 
of the chief accountant of the Pishchevik works under 
construction in Komsomolsk and the director of the Tsentr 
limited-liability partnership from Amursk. Abusing their 
positions, this pair embezzled R20 million intended for the 
construction of the Pishchevik. Criminal proceedings are being 
instituted against the director of the Ladoga small-scale 
enterprise for forgery, via which R5 million were 
misappropriated. Other material, alas, is as yet lying unused 
and is waiting for its time to come.... 
  And one further cause of our distress--the conditions of the 
storage of weapons. Even in the military units the theft of 
weapons has become almost a commonplace phenomenon. The theft of 
122 Makarov pistols and Nagant revolvers from the warehouse of 
the Higher Militia School was uncovered last year. And eight 
assault rifles have "disappeared" this year from the weapons 
depot of a military unit. And our officers recently detained a 
group of inhabitants of Nakhodka, who had brought into 
Khabarovsk two pistols, one Nagant revolver, two grenades, and 
three firing mechanisms for explosives. The origins of all these 
"goods" are currently being looked into, but we can from our own 
experience already surmise that there have once again been 
sloppy work, heedlessness, and a lack of control somewhere. 
  [Baranov] What are the current concerns of the regional 
office for organized crime? 
  [Kolotvin] Waiting for new homes, if we are speaking about 
internal matters. As far as work is concerned, there is, as 
always, a multitude of them. A group of the Nikolayevsk Bulk 
Plant, which this year alone has contrived to misappropriate 700 
tonnes of diesel fuel, is being investigated in 
Nikolayevsk-na-Amure. A group of persons who stole R25 million 
worth of liquor from a storehouse of the Intertorg 
individual-private enterprise is being investigated. We have 
considerable work to do with the Rossich Athletic Club. The 
leader of the Nikolayevsk "syndicate" is being arraigned on 
suspicion of homicide, and cases concerning the misappropriation 
of material assets totaling R80 million are being investigated. 
Sufficient? 
  [Baranov] Do you have sufficient forces for it all? 
  [Kolotvin] We should have. Were we to meet with more 
understanding and assistance on the part of the municipal and 
rayon authorities and inhabitants of the kray, we could be more 
vigorous in curbing the onslaught of crime....

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Mashkov, representative of the president </F>
of the Russian Federation in Sverdlovsk, under the rubric 
"Between Us": "A Ural Republic: In Whose Interest?"] 
  [Text] Although the project "Ural Republic" was 
rejected by federal authorities, it has not yet been relegated 
to the archives. As before, it is still being debated--in both 
Yekaterinburg and Moscow. It happens that the public essentially 
knows the point of view of the authors of the "Sverdlovsk 
initiative." Nevertheless, they have serious opponents; for 
example, Vitaliy Mashkov, representative of the president of the 
Russian Federation in Sverdlovsk Oblast. Inasmuch as OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA has given the floor more than once to those who are "for" 
the initiative, we do not think it possible to refuse this right 
to a person who is resolutely "against" it. Especially since 
Mashkov was not allowed to speak at recent parliamentary 
hearings "on the Ural Republic problem." 
  As I was already convinced, the driving force behind the 
autonomization of Russian-speaking regions of the Russian 
Federation are local elite groups that were organized by the 
former Soviet party-administrative nomenklatura and the leaders 
of criminal business. They created regional mafiosi-monopolistic 
clans that dominate the localities in both the economy and 
sociopolitical life. It is these clans that are attempting to 
exploit the difficult transition period and the weakness of the 
federal authorities by inciting the separatism of the regions in 
order to acquire the maximum amount of freedom in the 
disposition of regional resources. 
  As is known, the infrastructure of the Middle Urals was 
formed during wartime on the basis of industrial enterprises 
that were evacuated from the European part of the USSR, which 
made it something of a model for all of Russia in the postwar 
period, where all the political-economic processes are 
transpiring sooner and quicker. In view of this, Sverdlovsk 
Oblast was also prepared for the initiation of separatist 
actions earlier than other Russian regions. In addition, the 
dissolution of the Supreme Soviet of Russia and the absence of a 
State Duma in this period created what was already known by the 
Bolsheviks to be the precondition of revolution--"it was too 
early yesterday, but it will be too late tomorrow"--for the 
active appearance of Sverdlovsk authorities in November of last 
year. The federal authorities at that time did not clash with 
deluded provincial politicians, who went to extremes in their 
sincere zeal to improve the state structure of Russia, but with 
prudent businessmen who were out to snatch their own firebird 
from the sleeping guards. 
  At the end of last year the Control Directorate of the 
president's staff, and not so long ago a commission of the 
Security Council of Russia, conducted short-term audits on the 
use of Sverdlovsk Oblast resources by local authorities and the 
state of affairs in the law enforcement sphere. As far as I 
know, both commissions left in a panic, inasmuch as they 
encountered prototypes of mafiosi power, which is threatening 
the country more and more openly. Local "authorities" are not 
averse to using various provocations even against me, an 
official of rather substantial rank. 
  And there is something for them to fear. Literally in the 
last few days I learned about another scandalous fact: It is not 
known in whose interests 20 billion rubles [R] that were 
transferred abroad were "circulating" for more than a half year, 
but it was certainly not in the interests of the oblast or the 
country. I think that there is scant hope that all the 
violations of the law of the last year will become the subject 
of criminal proceedings--the list of players in these affairs is 
too long. 
  Another fact is also vexing: Those local democrats who just 
yesterday railed at abuses are suddenly coming out in unison 
today for the people against whom they fought energetically. 
What is this--a lack of principles, bribability, or something 
else that I do not understand? But, after all, the role of these 
people in the truly stupefying, massive propaganda idea of a 
"Ural Republic" is very great. People listened to their opinion 
for several years and believed in them as fighters for a new 
Russia. As a result, with the help of a number of democrats and 
scientists who are prepared for a position and promises to serve 
anybody and propagandize anything, the idea of revising the 
Bolshevist national-territorial division of Russia was replaced 
by the idea of a "Ural Republic." The result of the oblast 
referendum, when 84 percent of residents expressed themselves 
for equalizing the rights of components of the Federation, was 
exploited very cleverly. Entirely correctly, the bulk of the 
people understand very well that the inequality of the 
components is ruinous for the Federation, and that this 
situation has to be corrected. The whole question is how. It is 
here that the trump card was pulled out of the sleeve--they said 
that the people want a "Ural Republic." But what are we, worse 
than the Tatars, or what? An element of nationalism was 
introduced immediately--for certain purposes, it is also good. 
But further there were shouts: They are looting us! Ural 
residents pay enormous sums of money into the budget, but the 
Russian republics are outright spongers. 
  And the propaganda machine went to work! Relieved from his 
position, Governor Rossel almost became a national hero whom 
grateful countrymen encouraged with two deputy seats--to the 
oblast senate and duma. The nonparty association "Transformation 
of the Urals," created by Rossel, which has purely party charter 
objectives--the formation of a political elite of the region--is 
functioning actively. It is interesting to note that all the 
documents for the organization of this association were 
submitted on the same day the edict was published on the removal 
of Rossel from the position of governor. It seems that 
preparations were carefully made for an earnest struggle a long 
time ago.

<F P=106> [Article by Seyfali Akhundov: "A Free Zone Is Worse than </F>
Coercion"] 
  [Text] Sakhalin Oblast--The administration of 
Sakhalin Oblast has submitted a request to the central 
authorities of the Russian Federation to introduce a border 
regime in the region. In the opinion of the leadership of the 
oblast, a 5 kilometer border zone will stop unscrupulous 
businessmen and poachers who are exploiting the natural wealth 
of Sakhalin in their own selfish interests, fishing for valuable 
marketable species of fish in coastal waters, and conducting 
raids on the spawning grounds at the mouths of Sakhalin 
rivers. 
  In accordance with the Law of the Russian Federation on the 
State Border, the administrations of the krays and oblasts that 
adjoin foreign borders of Russia were given the right to 
determine the rules for the presence of citizens on their 
territories. Henceforth, in order to acquire the right to be in 
the rayons of Sakhalin Oblast, those who enter the 5 kilometer 
border zone will have to register here. Foreign citizens will 
have to secure the approval of competent organs. 
  In the opinion of the deputy governor of the oblast, Viktor 
Gurevich, these measures are intended first of all to subdue 
poachers--citizens of Russia and CIS countries--and do not have 
a direct bearing on the illegal fishing business by Japanese 
fishermen in Russian territorial waters. "Japanese economic 
expansion is not threatening Sakhalin," said Gurevich to an 
OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent, "and you cannot lure them here 
for all the money in the world" (the Japanese--S.A.). While the 
toughened border regime in Maritime Kray and other rayons 
adjoining the Sino-Russian border has a political character--the 
prevention of purposeful assimilation of Chinese in Russia--the 
actions of the Sakhalin administration are the result of 
economic reasons. It is necessary to prevent the illegal export 
of valuable maritime products from the peninsula. 
  Ocean delicacies are the only articles of income for the 
meager budget of the oblast. However, Sakhalin does not receive 
1 kopek for the sale of fish and ocean products on account of 
the state order. According to Gurevich, the situation in the 
oblast is catastrophic, and the workers of budget organizations 
have not received their pay for half a year already. The quota 
of delicacy fish and ocean products allocated to Sakhalin by the 
Government of the Russian Federation is enough only to exchange 
them for fuel and vital products. According to the latest 
calculations, the cost of the consumer basket in South Sakhalin 
is R150,000. Prices here, given the same rates of pay as on the 
mainland, are higher than Moscow by a factor of five. "The 
Russian Government is doing everything to convince residents of 
the Far East that these territories are not necessary to 
Russia," declared Gurevich. 
  The introduction of a border regime on the peninsula of 
Sakhalin will most likely bury the free economic zone that was 
established here. The result of this economic experiment is 
already that the counters of local stores, which were always 
filled with fish and ocean products, have become empty. The 
unpopularity of the SEZ [Free Economic Zone] at one time became 
one of the reasons for the defeat in municipal elections of 
Vyacheslav Fedorov, a former governor of the oblast and 
apologist of a free economy.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Yuriy Spiridonov, chairman of the </F>
Komi Supreme Soviet, by Natalya Koposova; place and date not 
given: "Spiridonov to the Center: `We Are Just as Good as You'"] 
  [Text] Elections are approaching in the Republic of 
Komi. Chairmen of the local organs of authority will be elected, 
but what attracts special attention in the republic is that its 
head will be elected. Today we present Yuriy Spiridonov, 
chairman of the Komi Supreme Soviet, a candidate who was 
nominated by more than 100 Komi organizations. The leader of the 
Komi Republic was heard of for the first time in Russia when the 
newly organized Council of the Heads of Republics (SGR) rapidly 
began to take on importance in Russian politics. A group was 
formed in the SGR--Spiridonov (Komi), Stepanov (Karelia), 
Shaymiyev (Tataria), Nikolayev (Yakutia), and Rakhimov 
(Bashkiria), which actually has been determining the policy of 
the republics with respect to the Center. 
  [Begin boxed item] No matter which way you turn, you cannot 
get a panorama of our 170 degrees of Russian longitudes without 
the Republic of Komi. But what do we know about it? Mining 
Vorkuta, Polar Inta and strikes, miners' pickets at the White 
House in Moscow... More? The capital of the GULAG under Stalin, 
where the model of "camp socialism" was tested, at present 
belongs to regions whose dominant idea is clearly mining. It is 
difficult to judge the whole republic after visiting only 
Syktyvkar. The capital city draws another picture, how to 
resolve the problem of the Pechora coal basin. Some hotheads are 
demanding the closing of unprofitable mines. Perhaps this is 
justified from the economic aspect. But it should not be 
forgotten that in 1941, when the German troops cut off the 
Donets Basin, it was Vorkuta coal that saved the country. A new 
coat of arms--a one-headed eagle--will soon appear in the 
Republic of Komi. Will the election results justify this symbol? 
  [End boxed item] 
  Every SGR meeting with the president caused ironic comments 
behind the scenes: How many and what kind of quotas and licenses 
were haggled for one or another political decision... It would 
be ridiculous to deny this: The right of the "to dispense 
favors" remains with the center as before. However, the SGR 
tried to change this tradition. After signing the Federative 
Treaty, Spiridonov and his colleagues consistently tried to get 
a redistribution of powers from the Center. Today the leader of 
Komi thinks that it is quite realistic to get away from the 
system of coaxing subsidies. 
  [Spiridonov] I want never to have to plead with Moscow, and 
we are ready to do this, if the president of the Russian 
Federation removes his structures... Give us equal conditions of 
price formation. And do not hinder the sale of products. And the 
taxes that the state does not collect in full now, we will bring 
on a silver platter. Then it will be able to resolve questions 
of the defense industry, the military, and pensioners. [end 
Spiridonov] 
  The president has now approved a schedule of signing of 
treaties between the federal center and the components of the 
Russian Federation. Spiridonov, one of the leaders of the 
regional Russian elite, believes that from an economic aspect 
the krays and oblasts should have equal opportunities with the 
republics. Today's crisis is difficult for everyone, but Komi's 
situation can be called extremely difficult. Therefore, 
Spiridonov consistently lobbies in the Federation Council for 
laws that promote a change in the situation in the republic. 
  [Spiridonov] The main thing for us is to adopt a law on the 
Northern Territories that regulate questions of benefits and 
compensation for people living in the rayons of the Far North 
and those comparable to it. Moreover, a state program for the 
development of the northern regions is absolutely necessary 
today. After all, more than 90 percent of all of the mineral-raw 
material potential of Russia is concentrated in them. [end 
Spiridonov] 
  Spiridonov's style of work was noticed in the Center a long 
time ago. And for those in the know, Viktor Chernomyrdin's 
decision to draw the leader of the republic into the Government 
of the Russian Federation for the position of first deputy in 
charge of fuel and energy questions was not a big surprise. 
  However, Spiridonov preferred to remain in Komi... 
<H5>  Sources </H5>
  It is not easy to understand Yuriy Alekseyevich's strong 
attachment to this severe land. It seems that he was not even 
born here, but in faraway Omsk Oblast. He graduated from an 
institute in Sverdlovsk, and later worked at the Gornyy mine in 
Magadan Oblast. He went through the school of life there, 
starting out as a foreman. He turned up in Komi in 1964. 
  [Spiridonov] Every day of work at that time brought 
happiness. Just the construction of the hot water system to 
Bagan was worth a lot. Instead of a hundred meters, we began to 
lay a kilometer to a kilometer and a half in a day. Now--it is 
not the same. Some kind of dissatisfaction always remains. [end 
Spiridonov] 
  Veterans of Usinsk, people who worked with him, call him 
"Pop" to this day. He "captured" the people, it is said, with 
trustworthiness. If he called for "plowing," then he was the 
first to set an example. But the main thing is that Spiridonov 
succeeded in inspiring trust in people, in changing attitudes 
toward the land, to which either romantics after a 
"will-o'-the-wisp" were drawn, or, just the opposite, 
self-servers who were after quick and easy money. It is 
recounted that when he received the assignment to Usinsk, there 
were not many enthusiasts there. People, who were housed in 
barracks, had "started to become brutalized." They were sick of 
the disorder. They came to earn a little money--and go back. At 
that time in 1981, all of Usinsk's wells produced an increase in 
production of 20,000 tonnes of oil annually. Spiridonov raised 
this to 70,000 in two years. The more oil, the more income there 
was in the city budget. They started to build more. People were 
housed not in communal accommodations but in separate 
apartments. And people stopped scattering. 
  Immediately after this, Spiridonov was appointed to the Komi 
Oblast CPSU Party Committee as second secretary. When Spiridonov 
was elected first secretary, elections were going on in the 
country to a renewed and restructured Supreme Soviet of the 
USSR. He was nominated as a candidate, and his rivals were 
Father Gleb Yakunin and ARGUMENTY I FAKTY Editor in Chief 
Starkov... 
  Spiridonov, who did not make an abrupt change from the 
communists to the democrats and patriots, then had to render an 
account to the voters of Ukhta for the entire CPSU and for all 
leaders from Lenin to Brezhnev. It is amusing and sad to 
acknowledge this, but witnesses recall that a female cloakroom 
attendant, who, attracted by the noise of the crowd, 
accidentally ended up in the hall, stuck up for Spiridonov. She 
put to shame the denouncers, who were not letting him say a word 
clearly. 
  Spiridonov was elected. Yakunin and Starkov withdrew their 
candidacies before the elections. 
<H5>  Comrades-in-Arms </H5>
  It is the same story today before the elections to the post 
of head of the republic. Estimating the situation realistically, 
Anatoliy Karakchiyev, the mayor of Syktyvkar, withdrew his own 
candidacy and joined a group in support of Spiridonov. After the 
affirmation of the head of the city, young and fresh forces were 
oriented to Spiridonov. They were confident that changes in the 
republic were possible if Spiridonov led the process. 
  The same opinion is held by Vladimir Torlopov, the first 
deputy of Spiridonov's main rival, Prime Minister Vyacheslav 
Khudyayev. He believes that without a renewal of the government 
and without involving new personnel, it will be impossible to 
contain the situation. In the present extreme situation no one 
except Spiridonov, Torlopov is convinced, will be able to 
execute leadership, or, moreover, to ensure change. 
  The people in the group supporting Spiridonov are 
principally 
those who went through the entire election campaign with him. 
The reason for this constancy is one and the same--he does not 
desert people. In any situation. Valentin Kotelnikov, director 
of Syktyvkar's personnel center, recounted the following story. 
  Masha Trikhanovich, a single woman and secretary of the city 
party committee of the Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist 
Youth League], who almost died in a car accident in 1980, worked 
with Spiridonov a long time. The first one to rush to the 
hospital at that time was Yuriy Alekseyevich. Dropping his own 
affairs, he helped the accident victim--he himself fixed blinds, 
repaired a mirror... And although many years have passed, to 
this day he supports Masha, who became an invalid. 
  People's teacher A. Katolikov, director of the Syktyvkar 
agricultural boarding school, appearing on the local television 
program "Pyramid of Power," probably most accurately defined the 
inner substance of the republic's leader: He is good in a purely 
human way... Children are attracted to him." Spiridonov often 
visits the boarding school. Always with gifts. 
  Once, as A. Katolikov recounted, a "Farmer" tractor was sent 
to him from Holland. And along with it, another one--a small 
one, which bore the inscription "To Fedor Spiridonov." "We 
wondered a long time who it was for. And then we realized, this 
was Spiridonov's grandson...! Two weeks passed, and Yuriy 
Alekseyevich drove up, towing this tractor behind him: "You 
know, I was told that your lads liked it very much..." 
<H5>  Hostage </H5>
  It would seem that it was not necessary for him, who still 
did not lose any of his human qualities on the road to 
authority, to remain in high politics. Especially in this 
period, when it is unlikely that anyone will say thank you, and 
why take the burden of such an unenviable economy on one's 
shoulders? It is simpler to go upward, where he will be taken at 
any moment. But it would be a pity for Spiridonov to leave 
hundreds of started projects. 
  [Spiridonov] I cannot drop all of this today... I have 
simply 
become hostage to all these matters. I know what I must bear. 
[end Spiridonov] 
  This is understood in both the Center and in the republic. 
For Moscow, Spiridonov has become almost the last conductor 
through whom they can still influence a region that goes on 
strike regularly. He is the last guarantor of the future for the 
republic and for the miners. 
  It is understood in the republic that were it not for 
Spiridonov, it would take even longer to wait for a real payment 
of debts, and the transferred sums could be "idle" to this day. 
Yes, Spiridonov will also periodically have to play the role of 
"no-nonsense expediter." But, as he himself hopes, temporarily, 
as long as the Center continues to fulfill functions that are 
uncharacteristic for it. 
  As for his preelection program, Spiridonov thinks that these 
are the priority directions in his strategy: 
  --reanimation of laws adopted by the Supreme Soviet of Komi: 
"On Additional Guarantees for Maternal and Child Protection," 
"On Social Protection of Invalids," and "On Social Protection of 
Veterans in the Republic of Komi"; 
  --ensuring financing of the state programs: "Childhood" and 
"Health of Women--Planning a Family"; 
  --further development of the fuel-energy and lumber 
complexes; the main thing here is to increase the quality of 
produced products owing to the creation of a higher 
technological processing standard, which will ensure their 
competitiveness on the world market; 
  --establishment of a new mining-metallurgical complex for 
mining and processing bauxite, titanium and manages ores, 
barite, rock salt, and other minerals; 
  --establishment of a scientific-production center for 
processing preplanned and pre-project materials for the 
development of productive forces, an economic estimate, and the 
creation of effective technologies for processing raw minerals 
without waste; 
  --preservation of an atmosphere of international peace and 
harmony, which is traditional for the Komi region.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Ivanov: "An Oblast Politician of a Russian </F>
Scope"] 
  [Text] An old enemy of Boris Yeltsin--the chairman of 
the Kemerovo Legislative Assembly, Aman Tuleyev--has once again 
exhibited his obstinate nature by refusing to sign the agreement 
on civil accord. He explained his refusal by a mistrust of the 
document's initiators and, specifically, of the government 
which, in his words, is wallowing in corruption. 
  Aman Tuleyev is one of the more talented opposition 
politicians. A Kazakh by nationality, he has succeeded in 
becoming a public leader of his oblast. A communist by 
conviction, he has succeeded in persuading the local miners to 
change over from being firm Yeltsin supporters to being 
confirmed oppositionists. 
  Aman Tuleyev began as an "oblast politician." In 1990 he 
became a people's deputy of Russia, and then headed up the 
Kemerovo oblsovet [oblast soviet] and ispolkom [executive 
committee]. But already after a year he announced his candidacy 
for the office of president of Russia and finished in fourth 
place (after Yeltsin, Ryzhkov and Zhirinovskiy), receiving 
around seven percent of the vote. Of course, in the course of 
the pre-electoral campaign he showed himself to be a talented 
orator who knows how to speak vividly and at length about the 
misfortunes of the people. But a significant role was played 
also by a group of talented image makers, who molded Tuleyev 
into a great politician (we might add, the people who conducted 
his pre-electoral campaign were later invited to work in the 
president's administration). 
  In the days of the August events of 1991, Tuleyev met with 
Gennadiy Yanayev. The content of their conversation is unknown, 
but the mere fact that the talk occurred was reason enough for 
President Yeltsin to dismiss the obstinate politician from his 
duties as chairman of the Kemerovo ispolkom. The documents 
confirming Tuleyev's contacts with the GKChP [State Committee 
for Extraordinary Situation] were forwarded to the investigative 
committee, and he himself was forced to file an application to 
leave the position of chairman of the oblast soviet. 
  At this critical moment it became clear that Tuleyev was not 
alone in Kemerovo. Well-established ties between the local trade 
unions and the directorate became apparent. Tuleyev was also 
supported by the industrialists in the Supreme Soviet (his 
membership in the "Industrial Union" faction helped). The oblast 
soviet did not accept the resignation of its chairman, and 
Tuleyev withdrew his application. 
  Tuleyev's active contacts with the "irreconcilable 
opposition" began in 1992. Moreover, it would be more precise to 
say that the "irreconcilables" strived to establish contacts 
with the chairman of the Kemerovo Oblast Soviet. However, 
sharply criticizing the authorities and expressing his complete 
solidarity with the demands of the opposition, Tuleyev himself 
crossed out his signature under the constituent announcement of 
the Front for National Salvation. 
  In September-October of 1992, Tuleyev, being a realist, 
understood that the Supreme Soviet had little chance of 
withstanding the struggle with the president. He proposed that 
the participants of the 10th Congress move to Kemerovo. However, 
this advice was not taken, and shortly before the tragic 
dissolution Tuleyev himself left for Kemerovo to "work locally." 
  Obviously, Tuleyev has not been able to institute the 
"Kemerovo Soviet Republic." The oblast soviet was disbanded, and 
a secret attempt was made on Tuleyev's life: The attacker fired 
two shots into the closed door of his apartment. The politician 
got off with a mild scare, the guilty parties were never found, 
but these events marked the beginning of new growth of Tuleyev's 
popularity. In December he was elected to the Federation 
Council, in March--to the oblast legislative assembly, and both 
times he was victorious by an impressive margin. 
  Today Tuleyev feels confident in Kemerovo. Many members of 
his command have been elected to the oblast parliament, while 
his differences with Governor Mikhail Kislyuk have completely 
faded into the past (it was Kislyuk who nominated Tuleyev to the 
position of speaker). And since the old contacts with the 
directorate and the trade unions have been retained, and the 
miners have long ago stopped supporting Yeltsin, we may say for 
sure: The Kemerovo "president" is not frightened by the 
President of Russia.

"Chuvashia Has Decided To Attract Attention With Taxes"] 
  [Text] The representatives of a new class--the 
presidents of subjects of the Russian Federation--are competing 
amongst themselves in their eccentric measures in tax policy. 
Following the lead set by President of Kalmykia Ilyumzhinov, the 
President of Chuvashia, Nikolay Fedorov, also joined in this 
competition. His edict, "On Supplemental Measures for Regulating 
Economic Relations of the Chuvash Republic," was officially sent 
out yesterday. 
  [Begin boxed material] 
<H8>  Main innovations in Chuvash taxes </H8>
  A three-year tax moratorium for new producer enterprises, 
except those which have been reorganized; Reduction of the tax 
on bank profits to 10 percent; A tax (10-50 percent) on wages 
exceeding the minimum wage; A 20 percent fine for cash 
accounting. 
  [End boxed material] 
  Since it is difficult to think of anything principally new 
in 
tax benefits, Nikolay Fedorov is resorting to a rather 
traditional measure--a three-year tax moratorium granted to all 
firms registered after 1 May which operate in the production 
sphere. This moratorium does not extend to banks and insurance 
companies instituted after 1 May. However, the present 
30-percent rate of republic tax on profits is reduced to 10 
percent. In the opinion of the developers of this edict, such 
benefits are expected to attract investments to the republic's 
economy and to stimulate development of the financial 
infrastructure (in Chuvashia today there are only 10 commercial 
banks, with a total charter capital of 6.2 billion rubles (R)). 
  Then again, the edict also introduces a number of rather 
original limitational measures. Thus, enterprises and 
organizations which direct a large portion of their earned 
capital toward wages will suffer from the new republic tax, 
which will be collected on the sum by which the expenditures for 
paying the labor wage of one worker exceeds the minimum wage 
level. The rate of this tax will comprise from 10 to 50 percent. 
This innovation, according to the intent of its authors, should 
act upon the banks, monopoly enterprises in agricultural 
processing and other structures where the level of the average 
wage sharply exceeds the minimum. 
  The repeal of benefits on the profits tax for firms which 
make their investments outside the limits of the republic is 
aimed at facilitating the creation of the republic's own 
production base. (Today approximately 40 percent of the builders 
of Chuvashia work on the side). Moreover, those enterprises 
which try to receive payment for products sold and to spend it, 
by-passing the enterprise accounting report, will be subject to 
a fine in the amount of 20 percent of the sum received in cash. 
  The reaction to the edict in the republic was mixed. 
  In the opinion of Chuvashia's Minister of Economics Igor 
Mironov, the announced three-year tax moratorium makes it 
possible to expect the rapid growth of economic activity and the 
influx of investments already in the nearest future. In his 
conversation with our KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, Mironov 
categorically rejected the supposition that the innovations 
would impose a hardship upon the the city and rayon budgets, 
which would suddenly lose part of their tax revenues. First of 
all, he announced, the edict speaks of enterprises and 
organizations which will only now be created. Secondly, the 
republic leadership, which is responsible for its actions, is 
ready to compensate these losses in the future at the expense of 
the republic budget. 
  Then again, such optimism regarding the attraction of 
investments is certainly not indisputable. It is notable that 
the namesake of the Chuvash president, the former minister of 
finance and currently deputy, Boris Fedorov, quite recently 
rejected the affirmations of his involvement in the development 
of Chuvashia's economic policy. 
  The head of the Union of Goods Producers of Chuvashia, 
Vladimir Barsukov, expressed his puzzlement at the fact that the 
tax benefits introduced by the edict will in no way affect 
enterprises which are already in operation. Moreover, he 
announced that the punishment for accounting in cash under 
conditions of non-payments and the market crisis is ineffective, 
and will simply force the enterprises to seek ways around it.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Matveyeva: "They Really Want To Go Back </F>
to the Zone: The First Victory Has Been Won by the Inhabitants 
of the Region Along the Amur Who Are Demanding the Restoration 
of the Border Zones Along the Russian Bank of the Amur River"] 
  [Text] Nikolay Volkov, administration head of the Jewish 
Autonomous Oblast, has signed a decree entitled "Establishing a 
Border Zone and Introducing Regulated Limitations in Its 
Confines on the Territory of the YeAO [Jewish Autonomous 
Oblast]." Now, once again, it will be possible to enter dozens 
of major villages on the bank of the Amur, including the rayon 
centers of Leninskoye and Amurzet, only on the basis of special 
passes. 
  And yet not four years have passed since, by decision of the 
local Soviets of Amur Oblast and Khabarovsk Kray, which at that 
time also included the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, there was a 
rejection of strict border regulations everywhere in the area 
along the Amur. At that time, in 1991, many Far Easterners 
greeted literally with a hurrah the abolition of the border 
zones and the easing up of border regulations. And that was 
really understandable, because that radically changed the life 
of the border area: the bans and limitations were reduced to the 
minimum, and free access was opened up to the Amur and to its 
channels and tributaries in places where the border ran, and 
where the barbed-wire fences were removed, so that you could 
catch fish, relax, and enjoy the gifts of nature! 
  However, many of the inhabitants of the Far East and other 
regions of the country perceived the liberalization of the 
border regulations as permissiveness. A rare day has passed 
sincethat time on the border without violations and all kinds of 
reported incidents. Criminal elements of all kinds have rushed 
into this area: some with the purpose of carrying out smuggling 
transactions with their Chinese counterparts, and others were 
attracted to the bottomlands of the Amur by untouched areas of 
marijuana. In the border rayons, where crimes used to be 
extremely rare phenomena, robberies, muggings, and other heinous 
crimes have become an everyday occurrence. The border guards now 
have many new things to worry about. In addition to their direct 
duty -- the protection of the borders -- they have had to catch 
and eject from the confines of their areas the narcotics dealers 
who have come here. 
  It is not surprising that the population of the border area, 
which became accustomed during their long life behind the 
swing-down barrier to moderation and order, and which now is 
intimidated by this kind of bacchanalia, began almost 
immediately to demand a return to the old standards and rules. 
It took a long time for the local authorities to decide to take 
such a backwakrd step. But this is the first precedent. Probably 
the example of the Jewish Oblast will inspire the inhabitants of 
other territories to wage an even more aggressive struggle for a 
return to the previous regulations on the border. And the slogan 
"We want to go back to the zone!" will become even more popular 
in the area along the Amur.

"In the Interest of the Northern Peoples"] 
  [Text] The board of the "Yamal for the Descendants!" 
association discussed the results and implications of the March 
election and addressed a statement to Russian government 
agencies. 
  It says: "As a result of the elections to the Federal 
Assembly of the Russian Federation, there are no representatives 
of the small Northern nationalities among the three elected 
deputies. Only three of the 13 elected deputies of the 
representative agency of the government of the Yamalo-Nenetsk 
Autonomous Okrug represent small Northern nationalities. This 
has confirmed the earlier fear that the present electoral system 
would lead to a situation in which no one in the representative 
bodies of government would be defending the rights of the small 
Northern nationalities. 
  "The board of the `Yamal for the Descendants!' association 
demands that the RF Federal Assembly include quotas in 
legislative instruments on federal and local elections, pursuant 
to Article 69 and the first paragraph of Article 72 of the 
Constitution of the Russian Federation, so that at least 25-30 
percent of the deputies will represent small nationalities and 
ethnic groups." 
  A similar statement was issued by an association of small 
nationalities from Khanty-Mansiysk Okrug. 
  In the middle of March the State Committee on the Management 
of State Property issued Directive No 508-r. It defines the 
procedure for exchanging vouchers for shares of stock in the 
Gazprom RAO by the population of Yamalo-Nenetsk Okrug. 
  The board of the "Yamal for the Descendants!" association 
feels that the document "contradicts the essence of the Russian 
President's Directive No 58 of 26 January 1993 on the sale of 
5.2 percent of the stock of the joint-stock company to the small 
Northern nationalities and the personnel of budget-carried 
organizations and organizations securing the development of gas 
condensate deposits." 
  The association feels that the directive of H. Chubays' 
agency should be amended because it will allow all inhabitants 
of the okrug to take part in the check auctions, with no 
restrictions on the checks negotiated by a physical person. Even 
individuals who have never lived within the territory of the 
okrug will be allowed to bid in the auctions. The Yamal 
Investment Check Fund, which collected the vouchers of much of 
the rural population, has been excluded from the participants. 
All of this "will lead to a situation in which a privilege 
intended for segments of the population with little social 
protection will be granted to absolutely different groups, and 
primarily to commercial and shadow entities." 
  That is why the board of the "Yamal for the Descendants!" 
association authorized, Kh. Kzyngi, its president, to send a 
letter to Chairman R. Vyakhirev of the board of the Gazprom RAO. 
The letter explains the association's assessment of the 
directive and expresses the hope that esteemed Rem Ivanovich 
"will, as usual in recent years, take effective action to 
protect the interests of the small indigenous nationalities of 
the North.... 
  "The present situation is so critical that we have to take 
the necessary steps to let the population of the okrug judge the 
seriousness of our intentions to cooperate."

<F P=106> [Article by V. Spisarenko: "The Governor Is Certain of One </F>
Thing: Self-Reliance Is the Key, Because It Is Impossible To 
Rely on `Uncle,' and He Objects Vehemently to Politicization...." 
  [Text] On 11 April L. Roketskiy had another of his 
now traditional, semi-official meetings with representatives of 
the news media. Although he began with the equally traditional 
mounting of his "peasant" hobbyhorse, the range of topics 
discussed at the conference was nevertheless quite broad. 
  As far as rural issues are concerned, the oblast 
administration is adhering to the principle of maximum support. 
Everything possible has been done to secure a good supply of 
seeds, including outside purchases of corn and sunflower seeds. 
Credits have been obtained for purchases of new equipment, which 
the farmers themselves are not in any hurry to buy--it costs too 
much. 
  As for performance indicators for the first quarter, they 
are 
not that encouraging. Industrial production is declining, and 
this automatically reduces the income portion of the budget and, 
consequently, the amount of tax collected. This will affect 
people directly because the payment of wages will be delayed, 
although the administration is "able and willing" to minimize 
the negative consequences. The RF Ministry of Finance now owes 
the oblast around 13 billion.... 
  Despite all obstacles, the governor has also remained 
committed to his plan to build highways, and I think that there 
will be no objections to this. In particular, the RF Ministry of 
Highway Construction has offered its guarantees and support, all 
necessary repairs will be made on the road linking Tyumen with 
Yuzhnyy Balyk and Tobolsk, and the Yekaterinburg-Tyumen-Omsk 
highway now has federal status. 
  This was followed by a discussion of higher academic 
institutions and their students: They are experiencing 
difficulties, and the problem is not the administration, but the 
flawed mechanism of the federal system, which is responsible for 
"science," but has not taken this responsibility seriously 
enough. 
  When I asked whether the State Duma and RF Federation 
Council 
would be able to whip the system of federal agencies--not only 
higher academic institutions, but also state inspectorates, the 
police force, and other "budget dependents"--into shape before 
the 1996 deadline, the governor replied, in a dejected tone: 
"Not likely! So far, we have been able to rely only on 
ourselves...." 
  A paradoxical situation has taken shape in the oil and gas 
complex: It appears that our "black gold" is losing its 
competitive edge in the market, and many of yesterday's most 
steadfast clients now prefer other suppliers. L. Roketskiy 
blamed this on the oil producers and their lack of a complete 
system of production and refinery units, leading to a situation 
in which the fuel for the Tyumen enterprises' own gas stations 
frequently has to be purchased from...dealers in Tyumen. 
  I asked the governor a "probing" question: "Is this a result 
of the oblast's loss of administrative functions in the oil and 
gas complex?" He avoided a direct response by saying that these 
functions had been under the control of federal officials for a 
long time. It is true that this control is rather weak, but the 
administration itself is still doing something. 
  In particular, Academician Aganbegyan spent days analyzing 
the situation as part of a field study in Tyumen Oblast and 
concluded that numerous violations had been committed in the 
privatization of the oil and gas complex. Besides this, the 
oblast did manage, even if only after some delay, to acquire an 
additional share of the oil dividends through the property fund 
headed by V. Zagvyazinskiy. 
  The loss of competitiveness was mentioned again during a 
discussion of the products of agricultural processing: Although 
our cheese and sausage are considered to be ecologically clean 
and absolutely delicious, they are too expensive to compete with 
products from Kogalym. 
  The administration wants to allow our competitor-neighbors 
into our market to protect consumer interests, but L. Roketskiy 
did not answer my question about the intention of the executive 
branch to cooperate with the union of local entrepreneurs and 
commercial producers in this sphere: I suggested the need for a 
jointly developed and centralized system of interaction. 
  The administration plans to cut its committee staff 
positions 
by 20 percent and to demand the same from federal agencies. The 
governor had some words to say about the anti-monopoly 
directorate headed by V. Samoylik, which has "sheltered" the 
Republic Party within its walls and communications network. 
  He was equally blunt in his statement that the commotion 
over 
the municipal committee on ecology was dictated precisely by 
"political elements": In this case, however, it is one of the 
subspecies of the communist movement instead of the Republic 
Party. Anyway, this will not make the streets of Tyumen any 
cleaner. 
  In short, the head of the oblast administration, without any 
reservations, reaffirmed his commitment to the edict on the need 
to depoliticize the work of government agencies. 
  He has advised local politicians and the leaders of peasant 
unions and movements to avoid fueling political passions and to 
unite within the framework of the general accord around the 
shovel and rake, directing all of their democratic-revolutionary 
fervor into clearing all of the winter debris out of the city: 
"Total concentration on Environmental Cleanup Day!" 
  Roketskiy explained that the budget--in the oblast and in 
the 
Russian Federation as a whole--would have to be broken down into 
quarters because of all the present difficulties. No annual plan 
could withstand the current rate of inflation. 
  The conference ended with a discussion of...the Turks. It 
appears that the Russian common man thinks too much of himself 
and is too fastidious to do wet and dirty work like plastering, 
and prefers dryer and higher-paying jobs. The Turks, on the 
other hand, will do anything. They take care of each and every 
stage of a construction project, and they do the work quite well 
besides. This is one of the grim realities of market 
competition. Eventually, Russian builders will be forced out of 
the market by the Turks. 
  All of this was also discussed at the press conference in 
the 
governor's residence. Once again, Roketskiy repeated his fervent 
hope for the cooperation and constructive support of the new 
oblast duma, underscoring the high caliber of its membership, 
during the resolution of the whole mountain of current problems.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Babkin, chairman of Tyumen Oblast </F>
Trade-Union Council, by N. Filimonov from the Tyumen affiliate 
of RASI; date not given: "Will the Law on Northerners Work?"] 
  [Text] The commonly used name for the Law On 
Northerners is obviously an abbreviated title. The full title of 
the law is "On State Guarantees and Compensatory Benefits for 
Individuals Working and Living in Regions of the Far North and 
Locations of Equivalent Status." 
  This law, which was passed at the insistence of trade 
unions a year ago, just last April, and which went into force on 
1 June 1993, is still not working. The government immediately 
suspended almost 20 of its main sections because of insufficient 
funds. 
  The funds are still lacking.... 
  The Northerners are understandably upset. So are the 
trade unions. 
  Another regional trade-union conference on the social 
and economic problems of the North, the fourth of these 
conferences, was held in Moscow at the end of March. The topic 
of discussion is always the same--the non-existent guarantees 
and compensatory benefits. 
  Here is what one conference speaker, Chairman Vladimir 
Babkin of the oblast trade-union council, had to say. 
  [Filimonov] I know that the law began to be discussed more 
than three years ago, at the first conference in Murmansk. Later 
the whole draft law was "composed" in Surgut, at the third 
conference, in the presence of high-level government officials. 
Now there has been another conference, but this one was held in 
Moscow instead of in the North.... Why? 
  [Babkin] At first they wanted to hold the conference in 
Norilsk, but then they learned that hearings on the northern 
regions were scheduled for the end of March in the State Duma 
and make a quick decision to meet in the capital at the time of 
the hearings. This was done for the purpose of interaction with 
Duma deputies, but there was also the hope that representatives 
of the executive branch could also be urged to attend the 
conference. 
  [Filimonov] Did they? 
  [Babkin] They did not indulge us. Only Deputy Minister V. 
Kuramin attended. State Duma deputies and members of the 
Federation Council were present, however, and supported the 
conference resolutions, which they subsequently used in their 
work in their own committees and in the Duma hearings. 
  [Filimonov] I would imagine that the deputies who did attend 
are Northerners themselves. 
  [Babkin] Most of them are. One of them, for example, was 
Vladimir Gomon, the former mayor of Nadym who is now the deputy 
chairman of a committee. He has first-hand knowledge of the 
problems of Northerners and is now solving them in a new 
capacity. 
  [Filimonov] How was the situation in the North described at 
the conference? 
  [Babkin] It was called extremely critical, both in the 
economic and in the social sense. Oil production decreased by 
one-sixth and capital investments decreased by one-third in just 
the past year. Production cuts have extended to virtually all of 
the main fields of production. One out of every three 
enterprises is operating at a loss. In addition to all of this, 
there is the problem of non-payments and, consequently, the 
absence of money for the payment of wages. The personal savings 
of Northerners have depreciated, and the Northern privileges and 
compensatory payments are meaningless, because the cost of 
living in the North is rising each day.... 
  [Filimonov] Especially when this compensation exists only in 
the form of a written promise.... 
  [Babkin] Yes, especially in view of the fact that it is 
unavailable. The North is becoming more and more isolated. It is 
difficult, and just too expensive, for Northerners to travel 
anywhere else for medical treatment and vacations. The quality 
of health care and consumer services has declined perceptibly. 
The diet of Northerners has deteriorated. People are tormented 
by feelings of insecurity. According to surveys conducted by the 
Federation of Independent Russian Trade Unions, almost 30 
percent of the inhabitants of Northern cities would like to 
leave them as soon as possible. If it were only that simple.... 
  In short, signs of crisis are present in all spheres of the 
national economy in the northern regions, they spread more 
quickly here, and they frequently take the most extreme forms. 
  [Filimonov] In other words, people have no legal protection. 
That is why you are fighting for this law.... 
  [Babkin] For this law and others, and for many 
administrative 
ordinances. The law on guarantees for Northerners requires 
funding for its enforcement. Last year's allocations amounted to 
only 158 billion of the 560 billion rubles needed for its 
implementation. This year the Ministry of Finance calculated 
that the law would cost the budget 34 trillion rubles. Then it 
added up the figures again and came up with 80 trillion. The 
upshot was that since the budget could not afford either amount, 
the Northerners could not expect any help.... The Ministry of 
Justice, instead of overseeing unconditional compliance with the 
law, has taken the liberty of amending the nine main sections. 
  [Filimonov] The law does call for colossal expenditures. I 
do 
not think the government will agree to 100-percent financing--at 
least, not this government, which has to deal with the present 
budget deficit.... 
  [Babkin] We propose the sequential enactment of the law. The 
mechanism for implementing the law has to be set in motion. 
Under no circumstances should the main provisions be watered 
down. If we yield on any one point, we might lose everything. I 
discussed this, as well as the problem of non-payments in the 
oil and gas complex and the need to review the tax laws, in my 
speech at the conference. I am quite familiar with the problems 
of the North, because I worked there for 15 years. 
  [Filimonov] What would you do about the Ukrainians, the 
Moldavians and, in general, all of those who worked here and are 
now foreigners? 
  [Babkin] We want the governments of the CIS states to 
conclude agreements on mutual commitments to extend social 
benefits and guarantees to the foreigners in the North today and 
those who worked there in the past. The State Duma deputies 
agreed with us. While our conference was still in session, they 
arranged for a meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey 
Kozyrev, who promised to take the initiative in this sphere. 
  [Filimonov] I read the conference resolutions carefully. It 
is impossible to summarize all of the demands it addressed to 
the government in just a few words. Most of them seemed to 
pertain to sections of the Law on Northerners. Is that right? 
  [Babkin] Yes, it is. We are demanding funds from the federal 
budget for the implementation of the law and measures to solve 
the problem of mutual non-payments. We insist on higher 
compensatory payments for the rental of housing in the North and 
on cost-of-living adjustments in the personal savings of 
citizens. We also have other demands. 
  [Filimonov] How will you get the government to react? 
  [Babkin] Through the Federal Assembly, the press, and the 
Northerners' own labor collectives. The latter certainly will 
not have to be talked into it, because you can see how agitated 
they are.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Privalov and Andrey Chernakov: "Why </F>
Yuriy Mikhaylovich Quarreled With Anatoliy Borisovich: Luzhkov 
Against Chubays"] 
  [Text] Mayor of Moscow Yuriy Luzhkov's decree was 
made public last week. In it, the head of the city laconically 
announces the suspension of real estate privatization in Moscow 
until the president issues a decree establishing special rules 
for such privatization for the capital city--and until the 
Moscow privatization program is approved. That the mayor 
exceeded his authority, which is obvious from this action, is no 
sensation. Neither is the intensification of the confrontation 
between the mayor and the GKI [State Committee for the 
Administration of State Property] surprising--this should have 
been expected ever since the approval of a new state program of 
privatization undermined the mayor's positions in this struggle 
so greatly that he had no choice but to respond with a 
counterstrike. The mayor's escapade, however, brings back into 
focus the question: What is the whole brouhaha actually about? 
For the sake of what does Yuriy Mikhaylovich so stubbornly 
berate Mr. Chubays and try so hard to root out his influence on 
capital city affairs? To solve this puzzle, KOMMERSANT experts 
attempted to analyze one of the Moscow Government's latest steps 
in the area of privatization. This step was marked by a special 
statement issued by the mayoralty's press center at the end of 
February. 
  Through the mouthpiece of its press center, the mayoralty 
stated that the GKI "continues to dispose of real estate on the 
territory of Moscow" without the consent of the city 
administration. As an example of the glaring arbitrariness of 
Chubays' agency, the statement cited the incident with the 
EKSIKOM joint-stock company and facilities transferred to it for 
the "laughable amount" of 56 million rubles [R]. On 23 February 
MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA and VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA each published an 
angry item on the basis of this statement, joined the next day 
by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS needed an 
extra day in order to work out an original way of presenting the 
material: "There is only one reason why Aleksandr Alyoshin 
(deputy prefect of Moscow's Eastern District--KOMMERSANT) was 
killed--a GKI order signed by Chubays' deputy V. Sychkin. The 
substance of the order: to form on the basis of the former state 
association KHOZUS of the Russian Federation [RF] Ministry of 
Industry AO [joint-stock company] EKSIKOM. Yes, this is exactly 
what the item said. Had it been 1937, Valentin Sychkin would 
have had it after such an accusation. (Although, on the other 
hand, had it been England, the other side would have had it....) 
  KOMMERSANT experts felt that it was their duty to have a 
closer look at such a wily joint-stock company, especially 
considering that the incident in question is not over yet: Just 
a few days ago the RF Supreme Arbitration Court considered the 
appeals of the GKI and AO EKSIKOM regarding its previous ruling 
and did not find any grounds to overturn it. This is what we 
have found out. 
<H5>  How the Owners Multiplied </H5>
  The EKSIKOM AO was set up in December 1992 on the basis of 
the KHOZUS state association of the RF Ministry of Industry, 
which in turn was the legal successor of the economic 
administration (KHOZU) of the RF Minoboronprom [Ministry of 
Defense Industry]. The founder was the RF GKI. Charter capital: 
R56.4 million. The AO's charter mission--to operate residential 
and nonresidential facilities of Russia's former defense 
agencies, as well as commercial activities, and construction. 
The facilities coming under EKSIKOM's supervision were mainly 
residential buildings built in the 1950's-1970's in the area 
around Sokolnicheskaya and Samotechnaya Squares, Malaya Bronnaya 
and 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Streets, and other prestigious places 
in the capital--a total of 16 buildings. In order to ensure 
loss-free maintenance and operation of this housing, the GKI 
included in the EKSIKOM AO's charter capital so-called "built-in 
and adjacent space" in these buildings (six or seven facilities 
housing stores, cafes, and a fashion house), which is reflected 
in the society's charter documents. 
  As Rafael Sukhorukov, EKSIKOM AO first deputy general 
director, told a KOMMERSANT correspondent, at the stage of 
developing the privatization plan everything had been 
coordinated with the Moscow authorities--in particular, the 
Moscow City Council commissions on privatization and the 
consumer market and the Moscow Property Fund. A second option of 
preferences was selected, which gave the labor collective 
(plumbing services, maintenance personnel, guards, and 
groundskeepers) 51 percent of the stock, and in November 1993 
the EKSIKOM AO received certificate No. 304, signed by V. 
Bushev, head of the Moscow Property Fund, giving it the 
ownership of 51 percent of the charter capital--the 
total charter capital, which means, including the 
now-disputed facilities. 
  It appears that at the time Moscow authorities did not see 
anything wrong in the EKSIKOM AO's charter document. Neither did 
they see anything later, in January, when the Moscow Property 
Fund held a voucher auction and sold 10 percent more of EKSIKOM 
AO stock. Everything seemed to be going well; there were plans 
to sell at voucher auctions the remaining 39 percent of the 
stock--and then it suddenly turned out that the buildings and 
facilities in question had too many owners... 
  It suddenly turned out that at that very time when 
the EKSIKOM AO was being set up, and the GKI included in its 
charter capital the built-in and adjacent space on 
Sokolnicheskaya Square (which housed the Zenit store, the 
Stromynka cafe and the Lena Makashova Fashion House), the city 
of Moscow's privatization commission was disposing of these 
facilities differently. It approved privatization plans which 
envisaged the lessees' rights to buy out the facilities a year 
after the lease agreements--signed in the past with the USSR 
Minoboronprom's KHOZU--expired. And in the summer of last year 
the Eastern Territorial Agency of the Moscow Property Committee 
[MPC] approved renegotiation of the lease contracts for this 
space and the property therein, declaring itself the lessor of 
the federal property. 
  On top of that, so as not to make things easy at all, a 
contract between Minoboronprom's store Zenit and also 
Minoboronprom's advertising-commercial company Rassvet--of the 
existence of which neither the EKSIKOM AO nor the GKI had been 
aware--was produced, according to which the former leased from 
the latter fixed assets for a period of five years. The 
contract, along with carts and other equipment, also covers ("at 
the store director's request," it was ingeniously explained to a 
KOMMERSANT correspondent) the built-in and adjacent space 
itself, which therefore now had three owners... (Fortunately, 
Rassvet later had second thoughts and filed a claim with the 
Moscow Arbitration Court to invalidate this point.) 
  The funniest part of the situation is that the store, the 
cafe, and the fashion salon to this day dutifully pay rent to 
EKSIKOM: According to Mr. Sukhorukov, last week they deposited 
the current payment into the account of the not-quite-born AO. 
Even a child knows that whoever the lessees pay is indeed the 
lessor. For some reason, however, the Moscow authorities do not 
wish to understand this--first they provoked the collectives of 
the aforementioned enterprises into a conflict with EKSIKOM, and 
then, upon insistent "recommendations," literally dragged the 
latter to the arbitration court with the aim of having the court 
hand them the federal property once and for all. 
<H5>  `How Should I Judge You--By Law or By Conscience, as the </H5>
Lord Will Tell Me?' (A.N. Ostrovskiy) 
  So, the Stromynka cafe, the Zenit store, and the Lena 
Makashova Fashion House filed claims with the Moscow Arbitration 
Court asking that GKI Order No. 893-r dated 25 November 1992 be 
invalidated in the part regarding the inclusion in EKSIKOM's 
charter capital of the corresponding built-in and adjacent 
facilities. The Moscow Arbitration Court threw out the claim "on 
grounds of lack of subject of the action"--it reasoned that 
there is nothing to arbitrate, since the documents clearly 
stated: federal property. 
  The Supreme Arbitration Court, however, did admit the 
claims. 
Moreover, it ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. The appeal filed 
by EKSIKOM was overruled a few days ago. The arbitration court 
was not impressed with the full set of documents proving both 
the authority of the creation of EKSIKOM and the legality of 
including former federal property in its charter capital. 
  "We no longer know what to think," Nikolay Shmelev, 
EKSIKOM's 
chairman of the board and general director, told a KOMMERSANT 
correspondent. "One thing is probably clear: Too many interests 
are intertwined in this matter. There is no other explanation 
for what happened in the arbitration court a few days ago when 
our appeal was heard on the subject of the Stromynka cafe and 
the Lena Makashova Fashion House. It would seem that we 
presented all the arguments that prove us to be within our 
rights and that the GKI orders were justified. Frankly, we left 
the courtroom fully confident that now that we had brought and 
presented absolutely all the necessary papers, the old ruling 
would be overturned and the Supreme Arbitration Court would find 
the GKI orders to include into the charter capital of the state 
association KHOZUS (EKSIKOM's predecessor) the objects of 
federal property to be absolutely legitimate. But no! Again, the 
ruling was not in our favor. Did we not bring enough papers? We 
even brought a document in which the GKI (with Chubays' 
signature) instructs the ministries of the former 
ninth [directorate] to set up services such as ours 
to operate buildings and structures that had been on the books 
of these ministries. There is also a contract between the GKI 
and KHOZUS, which says clearly that these entities are 
transferred to our complete economic management for five years. 
But the court simply ignored all this and made a ruling which 
boils down to a contention that neither the GKI nor we ourselves 
were able to prove that these built-in and adjacent facilities 
are federal property. So I ask--what do they mean by "not able" 
when we brought all the documents, from a presidential decree to 
orders issued by Chubays and his deputies? What other documents 
could be needed? On top of that we brought the most recent GKI 
interpretation, written specifically for such disputes, dated 29 
March and signed by First Deputy Chairman A. Ivanenko, which 
clearly interprets the application of point 11 of Edict No. 
1230, which stipulates that leased enterprises have a 
first-option right to buy out space. The explanation says 
clearly that this right "does not extend to enterprises to which 
buildings, structures, and nonresidential space were given with 
right of full economic management, since right of full economic 
management is governed by property right rules." This is 
precisely about us! We brought this document to the arbitration 
court as well. Again, no reaction! It is literally a jinx--find 
something, we cannot tell you what it is, and bring it as proof 
of the legitimacy of your actions!.." 
  The EKSIKOM people intend to fight to the last. They have 
two 
more options open to them: sending an oversight complaint to the 
first deputy chairman of the Supreme Arbitration Court, or 
filing a complaint with Russia's Office of the General 
Procurator. They decided to pursue the former option. (There is 
no set time frame for consideration of appeals by the court's 
first deputy chairman, however, and "while the court is 
deliberating," GKI opponents can achieve a great deal.) After 
that, the very last resort: an arbitration court plenum. In 
short, there will be no time to work--they will be too busy 
litigating. 
  Do you remember the pilot Sevryugov from Voronya Slobodka? 
What saved him was worldwide publicity; otherwise he "would have 
been sucked into the centrifugal force of litigation and for the 
rest of his life would have called himself 'an injured party' 
instead of 'the pilot Sevryugov' and derived particular pleasure 
from uttering the words 'slap with a lawsuit.'" Unfortunately, 
EKSIKOM has not gained worldwide publicity, and therefore is in 
quite serious danger of this sad fate befalling it. 
  KOMMERSANT experts do not intend to get bogged down in legal 
controversies and try to forecast the outcome of this 
arbitration epic (although the arguments of GKI and EKSIKOM 
appear much more substantiated to us than the reasoning of their 
opponents). In our opinion, it is important to understand why 
this epic began in the first place--and what precedent it is 
intended to set, in the Moscow authorities' design, in the event 
it succeeds. 
<H5>  A Trend, However... </H5>
  That the mayoralty hates giving up "built-in and adjacent" 
areas in prestigious high-traffic places is quite 
understandable. They are very attractive, after all. It is quite 
possible, for instance, that precisely this space had been 
promised to someone. And then they remembered that they do not 
own it anymore and attempted to get it back. I. Kuraksina, 
director of the MPC's Eastern Territorial Agency, sent a 
claim to the EKSIKOM AO at the beginning of this year 
in which she simply demanded "transfer of said object 
voluntarily (!) to the MPC within a month." Quite logically, she 
was advised to take up this issue with the GKI. When it became 
clear that the impudence had not succeeded, a full-scale siege 
began. The city talked the lessees into filing a court suit 
(although they did not want to quarrel with the AO, which 
charges them surprisingly reasonable rent)--and the campaign was 
launched. 
  KOMMERSANT experts are inclined to associate this massive 
attack on the part of the mayoralty on the property, which it 
was fully aware did not belong to it (that is, property that 
belonged to 700 Muscovites--EKSIKOM stockholders--not the 
mayoralty, and not even "the city of Moscow"), with two recent 
events that put in great doubt the Moscow Government's chances 
to keep--if not for good then at least for a long time--all 
Moscow real estate under its complete control. 
  The first such event is of course the presidential edict 
approving a new state privatization program. It expands somewhat 
the regions' privatization rights, but also establishes quite 
unequivocally the primacy of the federal program over regional 
ones. The state program per se would not have scared the Moscow 
authorities too much--after all, they have successfully ignored 
the previous one in many respects, so the new one would not have 
particularly harmed them. But then the second event came about. 
We mean GKI Decree No. 353-r dated 15 February 1994 on 
privatization of nonresidential space. 
  When we published this decree (see KOMMERSANT No. 10), we 
pointed out that this document makes it possible to privatize in 
a matter of a few days at reasonable prices leased buildings, 
structures, and land lots, and generally speaking a lessee 
cannot be refused the right to privatize. Thus, a principal 
opportunity emerged to pull a great deal of this nonresidential 
space out of bureaucrats' grip and thereby make it an object of 
buying and selling, a foundation on which to develop a truly 
functional real estate market. It is this document--of a most 
direct action--that could quite easily put an end to the Moscow 
mayoralty's omnipotence. 
  Sensing the threat, the Moscow authorities decided to 
immediately produce a counteroffensive, and an exemplary--and 
therefore precedent-setting--one at that: prove that the capital 
city nonresidential stock is theirs to such an extent 
that they can not only refuse to give it up, but can actually 
take it back after whatever Chubays-authorized privatization. 
  The incident we have described is indeed exemplary of 
sorts--at least in highlighting the reasons why the mayoralty is 
waging such an irreconcilable war on the GKI. 
  The mayoralty accuses privatization a la Chubays of 
unfailingly leading to a change in enterprises' specialization 
to something that does not meet Muscovites' needs. We cannot go 
into a theoretical discussion on this subject here, but we 
believe it would be proper to emphasize that neither the Zenit 
store nor the Stromynka cafe nor the Lena Makashova Fashion 
House have in mind any future other than remaining a store, a 
cafe, and a fashion house. 
  The mayoralty accuses privatization a la Chubays of handing 
out state property at bargain-basement prices, thus 
shortchanging the city treasury. If you recall, the GKI was 
faulted for a "laughable appraisal" of EKSIKOM's property. It is 
true that the appraisal is not all that high. But, as Mr. 
Sukhorukov told our KOMMERSANT correspondent, the MPC intends to 
transfer the disputed facilities--albeit into different 
hands--at exactly the same price. 
  Which means that the entire incident described above--as 
well 
as the mayoralty's entire war on the GKI--is needed for one 
single purpose: to show this Chubays who is the master of the 
house. Who can suspend any attempt to transfer 
anything whatsoever in Moscow into private hands (truly 
transfer, not like in the draft of the Moscow privatization 
program, that is, without buildings and land--see KOMMERSANT 
Nos. 6 and 10). 
  The Moscow Government's Bonapartism is getting stronger by 
the day. Let us recall the recent "mayor's pro mille": The 
mayoralty decided to deduct for the city budget 0.1 percent of 
the value of every foreign currency operation conducted on the 
capital city territory--and will be taking this money despite 
the illegality of such deductions (see KOMMERSANT Nos. 5 and 7). 
Now the mayoralty does not want to let go of nonresidential 
space--so it announces the suspension of real estate 
privatization. It is frightening even to think what else may be 
suspended or introduced tomorrow--"until a decree is issued 
setting special rules for the capital city." 
  In light of such events one can only sincerely wonder how so 
much attention can be devoted for many days to some "version" of 
a state coup. For goodness sake, what coups? And most 
importantly, who needs them? Who would want to 
overthrow the state system under which anyone can 
become a local Bonaparte, that is, to put it plainly, tell the 
federal authorities where they can stick it and carry out their 
laws and edicts only to the extent it suits? 
  Going back to the ill-fated EKSIKOM, let us emphasize that 
it 
is willing to cooperate on a mutually profitable basis with all 
interested parties. Mr. Sukhorukov told a KOMMERSANT 
correspondent that the AO would gladly agree to create in 
Sokolniki a holding company that would include EKSIKOM (with its 
legitimately obtained space), its current lessee enterprises 
(with their equipment, know-how, and trade ties), and the 
Eastern District prefecture (with the set of rights associated 
with the use of infrastructure needed to resolve social and 
cultural household issues). And everyone would be happy. By the 
way, according to Mr. Sukhorukov, the late Aleksandr Alyoshin 
already was leaning toward such a solution: He wanted to create 
something like a business center on the basis of these 
facilities...

<F P=106> [Article by Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov: "We Are Law-Abiding </F>
People, but We Will Not Give Away Our City Property"] 
  [Text] I have to admit that I often hear, as of recently: 
What is there for Chubays and Luzhkov to argue about? Well, I 
want to say right away that I could have found some kind of 
common language with Anatoliy Borisovich, had it concerned 
something banal, of an everyday nature. Our conflict is not a 
personal one. Primarily, we are talking about two radically 
different approaches to denationalization and privatization of 
property. It is a conflict of two points of view: of the Moscow 
Government, and of the Committee for Management of State 
Property [Goskomimushchestvo] headed by Chubays. I would like to 
point out that the issue here is the attitude towards the 
property that was created by the work of millions of people. 
This very fact demands that we distribute the property in such a 
way as not to harm those who created it. This is the concept 
that was laid down as the basis for the privatization that is 
going on in Moscow now, and we are defending it. 
  This is the reason why some are saying that Moscow is nearly 
sinking the privatization process, that it is intentionally 
reining it in, due to its own, parochial considerations, and, 
therefore, it is ruining the system which is so orderly, 
according to the Goskomimushchestvo's thinking. 
  At present we insist on the privatization procedure we have 
chosen basically because the approach that is being defended by 
the Goskomimushchestvo with such orthodox fanaticism can only 
bring us, and is already doing so, to a collapse of the economy 
instead of stabilization. We are not insisting on a different 
approach because we are against privatization. On the contrary, 
we see it as a powerful catalyst of the development of market 
relations which will bring into the economy new banking and 
commercial capital, new administrative structures, entrepreneurs 
with a contemporary, constructive way of thinking, and good 
organizers. 
  I have to say that Moscow was there at the very beginning of 
privatization, and in number of privatized enterprises we are at 
the front line, as they say. Last year we practically completed 
privatization in trade, public catering, municipal and everyday 
services, transportation, and construction. Small-scale, rapid 
privatizing of trade facilities helped us resolve many problems 
related to supplying a big city with manufactured goods and 
food: More than half of all the food sold to Moscow residents 
has been acquired by commercial structures. Last year the city 
revenue received 21 billion rubles [R] from privatization; all 
in all, we have received 37 billion since this work started. But 
only an outsider can rejoice at those numbers. In reality, these 
sums are so small that they constitute a very unimportant share 
of our budget revenues. 
  This is what hides one of the aspects of our differences 
with 
the privatization program declared by the Goskomimushchestvo. 
  Free distribution of property or its sale at token prices 
practically led to its being simply auctioned off. How else can 
we view, for instance, the fact that functioning enterprises, 
which are part of the single industrial complex of Moscow and 
produce goods needed by Moscow and by all Russia, were sold as 
real estate, and at 1991 prices at that. There is a multitude of 
examples of such absurdity, but I will only cite one. The 
Goskomimushchestvo priced ZIL [plant imeni Likhachev], the giant 
of our machine building, at mere 4 billion rubles. This was at a 
time when new equipment installed at the plant was valued by 
experts at an incomparably higher price. The result? The ZIL 
conveyors have stopped, as you know. As the plant has became a 
joint-stock company, it does not have the money to pay wages, 
and the plant managers have to appeal to the Government of 
Moscow for help. But what do the new owners think, those who 
bought the controlling bloc of shares? I do not think they are 
overly concerned with the situation at the plant, with its many 
thousands of workers. These people bought it cheap and are 
treating it as a cheap commodity. 
  The ZIL story is a good example of how wasteful the 
Goskomimushchestvo is in its treatment of government property. 
Privatization brings practically nothing into the country's 
revenue, which means that our budget does not have sufficient 
sums to cover major social and investments programs. 
  Privatization "a la Chubays" highlights another dangerous 
phenomenon. It fails to engender real owners. The workers' 
collectives do not become such as they receive their enterprise 
practically for nothing. Neither, definitely, does it transform 
into owners those who invest their money, in the form of 
vouchers, in enterprises or numerous funds. On top of that, many 
people are still undecided about what to invest them in. 
Meanwhile, voucher privatization is entering its final, I would 
say landslide, stage. The deadline for voucher investments runs 
out 1 July. And what next? 
  Here I would like to mention the third aspect of our 
conflict. Currently, the Goskomimushchestvo is the sole owner of 
all government property. This fact allows it to dictate its own 
terms of privatization. But we insist on a very speedy division 
of property into government and municipal. It is a matter of 
principle for Moscow, given its capital status. This would allow 
us to conduct privatization in such a way as not to harm the 
interests of our city, to replenish its budget, and to implement 
our social programs. However, we still have not received a 
response to our proposal. Being law-abiding people, we, however, 
do not intend to give up our city property and we definitely do 
not intend to manage it thoughtlessly or negligently. 
  A recent session of the city government discussed the 
results 
of our privatization for the last year and its execution this 
year. I want to emphasize right away that we are basing our work 
on the government privatization program and adhere to the 
approved regulatory acts. But at the same time, the program 
stipulates that our city is carrying out the difficult functions 
of a capital city, that we have a huge population and huge 
property holdings and, therefore, the issue of managing this 
property is of vital importance for us. Besides, we are entering 
the final stage of voucher privatization and it is our duty to 
help Moscow residents figure out where to invest their 
privatization vouchers. 
  In our consistent privatization process we have determined 
what should be privatized first, what should be done later, and 
what should not be privatized at all. This, of course, refers to 
the city's vital support systems. 
  Here is the final point. Privatization should entail the 
emergence of new owners who will buy property and start 
thinking, apart from profits, about the interests of Moscow and 
its people.

"Major European Bank Arrives in Petersburg"] 
  [Text] A St. Petersburg office has been opened by the Dutch 
bank ABN AMRO, which is the fifth largest bank in Europe and the 
16th largest in the world. 
  The Dutch were not deterred by the fact that last year 
Russia 
restricted foreign banks' opportunities to work with our 
country's companies and citizens. According to information 
obtained from Mr. Van Tets, a member of the ABN AMRO board of 
directors, in the very near future negotiations between the 
European Union leadership and the Russian Government should 
result in considerable easing of the terms under which European 
banks operate in our country. It is possible that within one 
month ABN AMRO will be able to provide a full range of services 
to residents of Russia. 
  The Dutch have outlined three main focuses of their 
operations. 
  First of all, there is the capital market. With help from 
ABN 
AMRO leading Russian companies will be able to float their 
stocks and bonds in the West. In this way the Dutch bank will 
not be "siphoning off Russian resources to foreign countries" 
(the fear that exists among many proponents of protectionism in 
our country), but instead will help aid the influx of capital 
into Russia. True, for that to happen our companies will have to 
be competitive and attractive from an investment standpoint. 
  Secondly, ABN AMRO provides a whole range of services to 
private and privatizing enterprises. The Dutch have gained a 
great deal of experience working with countries that are 
reforming their economies, as the bank is already active in the 
Eastern European countries. 
  Thirdly, ABN AMRO handles project financing. It is possible 
that major projects will be carried out with its aid in our city 
as well. A particularly favorable environment for this is being 
created by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 
which this week considered a number of projects in connection 
with our city's development. 
  Of course, the instability of Russia's political and 
economic 
situation is hampering the influx of foreign capital, including 
banking capital. But the arrival of ABN AMRO in St. Petersburg 
on the heels of Credit Lyonnais and BNP-Dresdner Bank attests to 
a revival of international business connections.

<F P=106> [Article by Vika Uzdina under the heading "The City": "The </F>
Government Promises Us Financial Aid"] 
  [Text] During talks with the government of St. Petersburg 
Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin promised to lobby for 
federal budget allocation of $10 million to purchase Ikarus 
buses for St. Petersburg. This was reported yesterday by Aleksey 
Kudrin, Economics and Finance Committee chairman. 
  It is possible that St. Petersburg will once again be among 
the "clients" of a special government fund which up until 1989 
subsidized the city's transportation expenditures. However, 
municipal transport will only receive government support if 40 
percent of expenditures for its upkeep are paid for by ticket 
sales. As for the bus production that is supposed to be started 
up by KaMAZ and Kirovskiy Zavod in the town of Gorelovo, that 
project will very likely be included in the federal list of 
facilities eligible for priority funding (at least according to 
a proposal submitted by Russian vice-premier Aleksandr Shokhin). 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin also announced that in the near future 
the government will pay off last year's indebtedness for the 
city's Metrostroy company, a debt that currently stands at R19 
billion [rubles]. A total of 170 billion "federal" rubles are 
supposed to be allocated for subway construction here in 1994, 
but only R8 billion has been made available thus far. (By way of 
comparison, the Moscow subway system has received funding of 
R1.1 trillion.) 
  Of the R32 billion allocated by the government for the 
preparation and conducting of the Goodwill Games, only R18 
billion has been transferred to the city budget. As Aleksey 
Kudrin noted, even those funds have not reached their proper 
destination, and at this time sports facilities are being built 
and renovated at the city's expense. In addition, Aleksandr 
Shokhin intends to attempt to get the funding increased to R49 
billion. Additionally, the Russian Government will consider 
whether to provide tax incentives for the importation of the 
imported products required for the Goodwill Games.

"Will A. Sobchak Become Russia's Ambassador in the United 
States?"] 
  [Text] Last year the St. Petersburg branch of the 
State Tax Inspectorate become one of the top ones in the Russian 
Federation, and unquestionably the top in terms of hard currency 
revenue for the treasury. From the moment the tax inspectorate 
was set up three years ago until October 1993, the St. 
Petersburg branch was headed by Dmitriy Nikolayevich Filippov. 
Why, despite such obvious successes, was he dismissed from the 
job? 
  How could St. Petersburg Mayor A. Sobchak allow this to 
happen? One would think that the city's first person would have 
the greatest stake of all in replenishing the treasury, because 
this is what pays for social programs, on which in turn the city 
head's reputation among the population rests. He did, though. 
And now St. Petersburg is unlikely to be as deficit-free as it 
was last year. The most disfranchised among city residents 
already feel it. 
  As long as the tax inspectorate was busy collecting 
underpayments from Russian enterprises, nothing marred the 
relationship between its leadership and the mayoralty. Their 
interests clashed when the audit extended to activities of joint 
and foreign structures. 
  One must say that the conditions for their existence in St. 
Petersburg are more favorable than anywhere in Russia. Foreign 
banks' branches here have absolutely no obligation to perform 
operations currently needed for the development of the Russian 
economy. At the same time, the rent charged their 
representations is frequently much lower than what domestic 
organizations have to pay to the city. Such are the laws of 
hospitality of the Neva banks. 
  The Russo-Swedish enterprise Europa-Hotel, for instance, 
found itself in an extremely privileged position. Most of the 
money--60 percent to be precise--for the hotel's reconstruction 
was provided by Intourist. And only 40 percent was comprised of 
foreign credit--also borrowed against the collateral of domestic 
property. Europa-Hotel is flourishing. And no wonder: The 
enterprise owes the treasury $7 million in taxes, while to this 
day it keeps the money earned in its operations in foreign 
banks. For the sake of improving the world economy, one has to 
assume. Alas, this charitable gesture did not impress St. 
Petersburg tax inspectors, who slapped the SP [joint enterprise] 
with $24 million in fines. 
  Simple arithmetics shows that if converted into rubles, this 
amount could cover all the needs of Russia's nuclear industry 
and keep nuclear scientists and their production side colleagues 
from picketing the White House. Moscow, however, at St. 
Petersburg's prompting, found it expedient to exempt the SP from 
paying the fines. 
  Another object of the inspectors' audit was the joint 
Russo-Finnish enterprise Lenrautamebel. It uses our cheap 
timber; the labor also is, as they say, aborigine, undemanding. 
This labor force produces a nice output, however, since up to 94 
percent of it is exported abroad. The earnings also are kept out 
there, away from domestic needs. This enterprise, too, was fined 
$10 million. 
  The Russo-Finnish SP Pizza-Express did not even bother to 
deposit foreign currency revenue. Sanctions in the amount of 10 
million Finnish markka were applied to it. 
  Attempts to call foreign businessmen to elementary order 
greatly surprised the Finnish consul in St. Petersburg. He tried 
to convince D. Filippov that the State Tax Inspectorate's 
activities undermine the Russian Federation president's efforts 
to attract foreign business to Russia. When Filippov cited as an 
example Finland, where such violations bring not only fines but 
also prison sentences, the consul was sincerely bewildered: "Why 
compare Russia with our civilized country?" 
  The main difficulties for the tax inspectorate headed by 
Dmitriy Nikolayevich began, however, after the decision was made 
to audit the activities of the St. Petersburg Property Fund. 
Some time in the past this fund was headed personally by Mr. 
Chubays who, upon his departure for Moscow, recommended a 
certain Bure as his replacement. 
  The audit revealed gross violations in the fund's 
operations. 
For instance, in the protocol dated 22 September 1993 the tax 
inspectors put on record that 44,981 vouchers were unaccounted 
for. The fund had not even opened a special account to keep the 
money received from privatization: it was kept--at 2 percent 
(?!) annual interest, like in a Soviet savings bank--in the 
privately owned Vitabank, which used this money at its 
discretion. I think there is no need to explain what this all 
means. 
  Let us take note of the date of the protocol: 22 September 
1993. We remember what a nervous, chaotic time this was. 
Nevertheless, only five days later the mayor of St. Petersburg 
personally visited the State Tax Inspectorate and went out of 
his way to highly praise its personnel and leadership 
professionalism. It turned out later, however, that on the eve 
of this visit Sobchak sent a letter to Moscow in which, quoting 
L. Filippov's nomenklatura past, he demanded that the latter be 
relieved of his duties as chief of the State Tax Inspectorate 
for St. Petersburg. That is, the democrat Sobchak proposed to 
start a witch hunt on political grounds. 
  Soon thereafter Filippov was informed from Moscow that he 
had 
been dismissed from the job. Then he received an insulting 
offer--to take charge of the Taymyr Autonomous Okrug tax 
inspectorate. And while the capital brandished the stick, 
Sobchak tempted Filippov with a carrot, offering a different 
prospect--to go to one of the American countries as a trade 
representative. Dmitriy Nikolayevich refused both offers. The 
logic of his action is clear: By removing him, attempts were 
being made to scare the rest, everyone who defends the interests 
of the state, those who serve the cause rather than persons. 
Filippov decided to hold firm to the end. 
  I remember how at the dawn of perestroyka chatty democrats, 
searching for cozy jobs for themselves in the power structures, 
delivered quite a few speeches on the need to appraise people 
solely by their business qualities, their professional 
competency. Well, in his time as second secretary of the 
Leningrad Oblast Party Committee D. Filippov was not in charge 
of ideology (as many current administrators were)--his 
responsibility was industry and economics. Apparently it is as a 
specialist in this area that he suddenly fell into disfavor 
among militant "reformers..." 
  We will learn the outcome of this conflict very soon: The 
matter is under consideration in the State Duma. 
  Sobchak's letter demanding the removal of Filippov, however, 
turned out to be just one of a series. For instance, a demand 
was sent to the minister of internal affairs to replace Anatoliy 
Kramarev, chief of the city internal affairs administration. He 
lost Sobchak's confidence after he initiated investigative 
action with respect to some individuals in the mayor's inner 
circle. 
  The recent visit to St. Petersburg of Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS] chief Stepashin gave rise to 
rumors of the possible removal of another professional--Viktor 
Cherkesov, chief of the FCS's regional administration. 
  A. Sobchak's reluctance to have next to him authoritative 
officials, especially in the "enforcement" area, is quite 
indicative: It is not accidental that the St. Petersburg mayor 
is asking emergency powers for himself from the Russian 
Federation president. Any emergency situation is profitable for 
whoever imposes it, because anything at all may be written off 
under this pretext. 
  Looking at what is happening in the city on the Neva, I 
unwittingly wonder that it is probably not accidental that 
Sobchak's old book had an evasive title "Pilgrimage to Power." A 
'pilgrimage' relieves one of the burden of responsibility 
imposed by power: Well, so I made this trip, it happens to 
anyone. You sort it out later, dear voters... 
  Was this not the yardstick the mayor applied to Filippov, 
offering him a foreign assignment? And does the mayor have 
enough tempting carrots for everyone he may be unhappy with? 
Hardly. Such "generosity" betrays the "benefactor's" own 
inclinations. Favorites just love to keep reshuffling personnel: 
In the confusion it is easier to mask one's own lack of ability 
and easier to make arrangements for one's own future by shifting 
from the "front line" to comfortable rear positions. 
  Information we have received from a trusted source is proof 
of this. As is known, a new Russian ambassador to the United 
States still has not been appointed. The information is that 
Anatoliy Sobchak is under consideration for this post--the idea 
that suits him just fine but does not elicit the needed support 
among professional diplomats. 
  If the appointment does indeed go through, I assume we will 
get to read about A.A. Sobchak's next creation--another 
"pilgrimage." This time across the seven seas.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Arkhipov: "They Raise a Ruckus But Are Not </F>
Heard"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg--St. Petersburg party leaders, having 
failed spectacularly at the elections to the City Assembly and 
hoping to make up for this at the fall elections, have engaged 
in a search for their "political faces"--somehow in the spring 
the voters were unable to see them clearly. 
  Of the 25 City Assembly members elected in April, only two 
are "party" deputies. This is an achievement of multiparty 
democracy in St. Petersburg. Which definitely shows that no 
party structures have a real influence on political processes in 
the city. At the microlevel, on the regional scale, even federal 
parties, which distinguished themselves by an advertising blitz 
on the threshold of 12 December, do not have enough symbolic 
potential. And St. Petersburg, by the way, is not a provincial 
town where "serious" politicians have yet to tread--it is the 
"second capital," which many party builders call a political 
testing ground for their initiatives. What is the cause of such 
a flop? 
  As usual, the losers began summing up the results by looking 
for someone to blame. They accused the authors of the rules of 
the game, who set the signature collection threshold at a level 
unsurmountable for some parties; they accused the city 
authorities, who extended the elections by an extra day, which 
destroyed the financial and tactical plans of party headquarters 
staff; and they accused the Moscow party leadership, who had not 
shown enough attention to St. Petersburg grass-roots cells... 
Everybody got it. 
  Party functionaries have a much more difficult time 
recognizing their own mistakes. Why, one would ask, did the 
election campaign, which theoretically should have consolidated 
party ranks, in reality result in complete confusion? 
  Before we answer this question we need to ask another: Was 
there a boy? Essentially, all the parties in St. Petersburg are 
imitations. It is hard to talk about them as structures 
representing social movements or trends in political thought. 
Formerly numerous political organizations in St. Petersburg 
completely crumbled. Over the past half-year rallies and other 
events have attracted between 10 and 50 people, which does not 
come close even to attendance at Krishna-ite Saturday 
processions. Movements have disappeared, their only 
accomplishment being that several club organizations have 
emerged in each part of the political spectrum. They did not 
have enough time to form stable connections with the 
corresponding sociocultural strata at the city level, remaining 
merely relics of the times of political activism. 
  Ideological connections proved no more reliable, which also 
is natural. It is hardly likely that narrow-ideology 
organizations (and the liberal, social-democratic, communist, 
and nationalist parts of the spectrum are represented by three 
to five small structures) could solidly "cover" the 
corresponding strata of the electorate. The mind of the city man 
on the street does not identify them with broader and not 
necessarily political preferences. 
  In addition, most party structures did their best to lose 
their "political face." Their leaders assumed that if they 
dissolved in hastily slapped-together electoral blocs and 
acquired stereotype rhetoric on the subject of economic 
"improvement," they would become more attractive to the 
depoliticized population. Only the LDPR [Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia] and the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation] escaped being merged into blocs of the most 
unimaginable configurations; the rest scattered in every 
direction. For instance, the Communists-Bolsheviks, the RKRP 
[Russian Communist Workers Party], and Working Leningrad 
disguised themselves as patriots in the Motherland bloc; the 
Republicans, the SvDPR [Free Democratic Party of Russia], and 
the SDPR [Social Democratic Party of Russia] split three ways... 
  Finally, there was a specific trait of local political 
leadership that had an effect. The independence of "second 
capital" politicians, traditional for this city, who often tried 
to compete with the Moscow "stars," only weakened the old 
personified image of parties. This special trait of the city 
party elite defined, by the way, the style of political 
interaction between various organizations. For instance, 
"democrats" who knew each other from the National Front, now 
finding themselves in some 15 different parties, made an effort 
to retain the luggage of old interpersonal confrontation. For 
them, discarding it meant crossing out their own political 
biography, to be deprived of the indulgence to commit the sin of 
independent "party organizational development." 
  Therefore, contrary to the hopes, the elections could not 
systematize the political market in St. Petersburg and become a 
beginning of organizational and ideological integration of party 
structures--after taking into account the political needs of the 
population. 
  Was there anything new in the behavior of the political 
leaders after the unsuccessful elections? Nothing that is 
principally new. Perhaps there are fewer "combiners" still 
searching for a cover in the form of some bloc or another--some 
have decided now to try their luck on their own. 
  Democratic Russia's obvious disintegration contributes to 
sovereignization and the search for an individual "political 
face." The elections have demonstrated the worth of its internal 
strength and moral unity: Even a conference decision that 
Democratic Russia is to participate only in the Democratic Unity 
of St. Petersburg bloc was ignored by many party leaders. After 
the elections Democratic Unity, on a shared basis with 
like-thinkers from All Petersburg, began to put together 
"Gaydar's party." And run into a problem again: Gaydar has 
bequeathed the cell organization to Arsenal plant director 
Vitaliy Sychev and State Duma Deputy Yuliy Rybakov. The result 
was a dispute between democratic movement romantics and 
pragmatists-privatizers from directors' corps and 
Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for Administration of State 
Property] structures. 
  Parting ways with this company is the Christian-Democratic 
Union [KhDS], with its roughly 40 members. State Duma Deputy 
Vitaliy Savitskiy, to the great displeasure of his Democratic 
Russia colleagues, announced the creation of a "populist party." 
The KhDS, which has proclaimed itself the only real political 
force, is beginning to test the unfamiliar populist rhetoric, 
having proclaimed a merciless struggle against 
"pseudo-democracy," "compradorial bourgeoisie," and "red 
directors," against "democrats getting into bed with mafiosi 
structures..." 
  The only example of political integration is the city's 
Public Chamber set up by 10 blocs. It is at the same time an 
example of how highly St. Petersburg politicians value their 
party principles. Opposition to Mayor Sobchak brought together 
communists, Zhirinovskiyites, nationalists, the NTS [People's 
Labor Union], socialists, and radical Democratic Russia 
members... 
  The public actually is not shocked by this. While the 
politicians are busy playing marbles among themselves, the 
public does quite well without them.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Clients' Victory Was Short-Lived"] </F>
  [Text] Calculations of the Analysis Department of the 
MediaSOFT Association show that in February-March of this year 
the profitableness of private investments in Novosibirsk banks 
exceeded the level of inflation for the first time in recent 
years. 
  Two circumstances were behind this: the sharp decline in the 
rate of inflation in these months and the fixing of a rate of 
interest on private deposits in Novosibirsk which was a record 
for Russia. 
  The monthly rate of increase in the price of the dollar and 
inflation and the increase in a hypothetical bank deposit at a 
monthly 15 percent (which corresponds to the average one- to 
three-month level of the private deposit rate in Novosibirsk 
banks in February) were used for the analysis. 
  The results were as follows: In February-March inflation 
constituted 15.6 percent, and the increase in the deposit, 31.7 
percent, while the dollar increased only 11.5 percent. 
  Thus the real increase in the deposit (adjusted for 
inflation) constituted 16.1 percent in the two months. This 
increase in a bank deposit even for a year is a fantastic amount 
for world practice, and the said profitableness in developed 
countries is typical only of speculation in securities, real 
estate, and so forth, but not of bank deposits. 
  Depositors in Novosibirsk's banks have for the first time 
won 
out over the increase in prices. On the other hand, the banks 
have for the first time lost appreciably, attracting deposits on 
terms profitable to the public. The banks had run into the 
obvious decline in the demand for credit, which had become too 
costly even for commercial transactions. 
  It is not surprising that at the present time Novosibirsk's 
banks are being forced to lower the rate on private deposits to 
the 10-13 percent a month level. This reduction is kind to the 
depositors here since with the present rate of inflation in the 
region the profitability of the private deposits is maintained, 
albeit not promising fabulous riches.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Palchikov: "Cold Climate for Business"] </F>
  [Text] Tatarsk--V. Naumovets, general director of a 
construction association, came to the newspaper's local bureau. 
I have known Viktor Sergeyevich for a long time: He is a crafty, 
competent manager. He has extensive ties not only with Russian 
businessmen but also with near abroad countries. 
  On my desk is a letter to Naumovets signed by Turkmenistan's 
Minister of Education R. Karayev: "The ministry deeply 
appreciates your association's help and your personal 
participation in the production and delivery of technical 
teaching aids, school furniture, and other equipment for general 
education schools and other organizations in Turkmenistan." 
  Viktor Sergeyevich himself says enthusiastically on the 
subject: 
  "What is bad about us attracting foreign investment, 
creating 
jobs, and paying taxes into the rayon budget?" 
  Nothing; actually, it is all very good. But why is the 
businessman in a depressed mood; who has hurt him? "Hurt" 
probably sounds a little innocent: Who can hurt a person who is 
economically free, who, as they used to say in classic Russian 
literature, moves millions? In this case the offending party is 
the rayon tax inspectorate headed by G. Martyntsova. By the way, 
a competent specialist and an extremely charming woman. 
  "There are driving us crazy with audits," says Viktor 
Sergeyevich. "They audit the same things five, 10 times." 
  A lively correspondence ensued between the "adversaries." 
  Here is what Galina Vladimirovna writes to Viktor 
Sergeyevich: "Dear general director! Point 3 of your 
statement that the taxpayer Tatarskseluchprofstroy cannot 
fulfill its obligations and pay taxes for 1993 sounds 
incomprehensible and absurd." 
  Viktor Sergeyevich responds to Galina Vladimirovna: "Dear 
Counselor 2d rank of the tax service! I am very grateful for 
your sincere and speedy reply to my letter. You permitted 
yourself a remark that the phrase regarding the impossibility of 
paying taxes for 1993 'sounds incomprehensible and absurd.' You 
did not read my letter attentively; Captain Nazarenko did not 
just "violate the form"--he impounded 100 percent of the 
documentation, including the balance sheet with attachments 
which you, Counselor 2d rank, kindly mentioned..." 
  This kind of politely cool fencing. As you may have figured 
out, the issue is simple: taxes. One side demands them; the 
other believes that it does not have to pay. There have already 
been appeals to the arbitration court, which made a ruling in 
favor of the association. A second hearing will be held soon. 
The tax inspectorate has learned from previous mistakes and is 
better prepared. It is hard to say in whose favor the ruling 
will be. 
  Both interlocutors are deeply convinced that they are right. 
  Let us listen to entrepreneurs: In addition to Naumovets, 
another participant in the conversation is V. Katernikov, 
chairman of Svyaz Joint-Stock Company and a store owner--he also 
has problems with the tax inspectorate, only this time the city 
one. He also won a ruling in his favor in the arbitration court 
and believes that entrepreneurs are being deliberately 
hounded--but without them neither the city, nor the rayon, nor 
the country will get on their feet. An increasingly greater 
share of revenue comes in the form of taxes from business; as to 
enterprises and organizations, life is dying there, while 
unemployment is growing. And the number of budget-financed 
organizations is growing. Over the past few years alone about 10 
new ones were added in Tatarsk: two tax inspectorates, tax 
police, federal treasury, employment center, pension fund, and 
so on. 
  Until recently Tatarsk had about 15 
cooperatives--construction materials manufacture, leather-, 
garment-making, and others. They have been crushed by all sorts 
of arbitration and taxes. Now there are no cooperatives, except 
those in trade, whose number keeps growing. Where would 
additional revenue for the budget come from if everybody 
consumes but nobody makes anything? 
  Galina Vladimirovna has a point, too, however: 
  "We do not want anything beyond what is due. All we want is 
to collect taxes; this is what the service has been set up for. 
If businessmen engage in tax evasion, what are we to do? It is 
not we who make life hard for the association--they have dragged 
us from one court to another." 
  The reader has probably noticed the entrance of a new actor 
in our story--Militia Captain Nazarenko, who the general 
director mentioned. He was the person who impounded the 
documents for the audit. In turn, Naumovets filed a claim with 
the Tatarsk People's Court. 
  It is said that the shadow of the recent elections hangs 
over 
this whole incident. The association actively helped its 
candidate to the oblast soviet and was stunningly successful in 
it. Heads of city and rayon administrations suffered a crushing 
defeat, after which the incident with the documents allegedly 
took place. Most likely this is a coincidence, an accidental 
occurrence, but the fact that the recently emerged structures, 
needed by the rayon and the country, cannot take root is very 
alarming.

<F P=106> [Article by R. Notman: "What Does the River Carry?"] </F>
  [Text] For many Novosibirsk residents the latest holiday 
ended with an alarming report on Russian television that our 
city is threatened by contamination and that some sort of yellow 
foam with a high concentration of arsenic and other hazardous 
substances is approaching the Ob Sea by water. 
  As it turned out, this report was correct to a certain 
extent, but at the same time somewhat exaggerated. It is true 
that an observer at the monitoring center in Shabalino (which is 
between Kamen-on-Ob and Barnaul) noticed yellow foam on the 
water surface and collected a sample. Analysis showed a markedly 
reduced content of oxygen in the water. With respect to some 
hazardous substances, on the other hand, the maximum allowable 
concentration [MAC] was considerably exceeded. In keeping with 
procedures, the observer notified control services of this. This 
is the way the information reached Moscow, where it was somewhat 
dramatized. 
  After the first analysis, samples were taken daily. They 
were 
sent to relevant services in both Barnaul and Novosibirsk. This 
is when the strangest signals began to arrive. One service (SES) 
discovered an increased content of arsenic in the yellow foam. 
First at the maximum allowable level, then exceeding this 
maximum 1.5-fold, and then on 25 April--14-fold. With respect to 
petroleum products content, the MAC exceeded the norm 
16-19-fold. At the same time, other services did not detect 
anything in the samples. Nothing alarming, that is. What 
happened is anybody's guess: different samples; someone trying 
to paint over the problem; or imperfect measuring equipment. In 
any case, the Altay Kray SES [Environmental Service 
Station]--and very often water contamination comes to our oblast 
precisely from there, from Altay--refuted its initial data. The 
Altay Committee for Environmental Protection came to the 
conclusion that mineral fertilizer had been washed into the 
water. And spring melting of snow brought more muck into the 
river. 
  Currently samples are taken daily. This will continue until 
the end of May. So far nothing alarming has been detected in the 
water reservoir. So we can stop worrying. Unfortunately, not for 
long. We are being helped by the spring thaw. There is a lot of 
water, which reduces the concentration of hazardous substances. 
In other words, once again we are being helped by accident 
rather than by people. There is potential trouble, however. 
Purification facilities in Barnaul have been idled today for 
several days for repairs. During these days it is permitted to 
dump 5,000 cubic meters of sewage a day into the river without 
treatment. After 25 May this untreated water will definitely 
approach Novosibirsk. What will be the concentrations then and 
what else will the mass media be reporting?

<F P=106> [Article by S.G.: "Counting on a Leader--But Whom?"] </F>
  [Text] The ideals born of the storm have dissipated. 
On whom are we oriented right now? Which leader can society rely 
on, a society in which theft and deceit have become the norm, 
where corruption has encompassed the highest echelons of power? 
On what individual can our youth orient itself? 
  It turns out our fears are somewhat exaggerated. Here are 
certain data obtained by the Laboratory of Applied Sociology of 
the Siberian Personnel Center (headed by Candidate of Historical 
Sciences N.D. Vavilina). Sociologists conducted studies among 
the population of Novosibirsk Oblast on the topic "How Young 
People Feel Socially" (directive quota sampling, 1,500 analysis 
units). Particular features of the material and social condition 
of youth were identified, levels of income for certain age 
categories delineated. Reasons for anxiety, attitudes towards 
the processes taking place in society, and attitudes towards the 
structures of authority were revealed. Also appearing in the 
questionnaire was the question: What kind of leader do young 
people prefer? 
  The sociologists focused their attention on young people in 
the 18-25 age bracket (Group A) and 26-30 age bracket (Group B). 
  Significant differences between these two groups were noted 
in the determination of type of leader. 
  Some 49 percent of those surveyed in Group A expressed 
preference for a leader distinguished by virtue of 
professionalism and competence. This percentage was somewhat 
greater--52 percent--in Group B. 
  But it turns out that a professional specialist competent in 
his sphere loses to a person who is simply decent, honest, and 
independent of political outlook. Such a leader--honest and 
decent--is preferred by 56 percent of the Group A respondents. 
But these young people are clearly less democratic than their 
older comrades. They clearly desire more than the others to 
bring order with a hard-fist approach--44 percent. The 25- and 
30-year-olds, on the contrary, are more cautious and basically 
do not trust a leader capable of "bringing order to society 
decisively, with a hard fist." Only 36 percent of Group B 
respondents expressed support for such a leader. But they too 
attribute a very great deal of importance to moral 
qualities--honesty and decency, as well as to professionalism. 
The young people surveyed did not attribute such importance to 
questions regarding whether or not this prospective leader was 
party-affiliated during the days of the CPSU, whether or not he 
supported Yeltsin's policies (although there were more 
supporters of the president in Group B than in Group A), and 
which party and movement positions he advocated. 
  Of course, we are not tolerant of others' opinions. Only 18 
percent of 18-year-olds and 12 percent of 20-year-olds had the 
courage to admit that they listen to and take into account the 
opinions of other people. 
  The antiparty sentiment of young people was also manifest. 
Over half of all groups either desire to give power to nonparty 
candidates or they do not trust any existing parties whatsoever.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Viktorov, with commentary by the Economic </F>
Policy Department: "Tax Policy Outlook: World Bank Experts 
Propose Coordinating Federal and Local Taxes"] 
  [Text] After KOMMERSANT-DAILY last Friday published an 
article on proposed adjustments in the tax system as prepared by 
the Russian Chamber of Trade and Industry, our editorial offices 
were contacted by Ms. Cristine Wallich, head of a group of World 
Bank experts, requesting that we outline the recommendations 
regarding reform of Russia's tax system that have been developed 
by specialists from that leading world financial institution. 
For two years they have been working within the framework of a 
technical cooperation program entitled "Budgetary Relations 
Between Governmental Bodies at Various Levels in the Russian 
Federation." 
  The work of this group of World Bank experts in Russia 
culminated in the publication of a summary report entitled 
"Russia and Problems of Budget-and Tax-Based Federalism." The 
assessment of mutual tax relations between the center and the 
regions and the accompanying recommendations contained in that 
report were very striking. Specifically, the experts are quite 
well aware that Russian authorities are attempting to balance 
the federal balance through the arbitrary shifting of as many 
expenditures as possible to the regional level, particularly 
expenditures for social needs and capital investment. As a 
result, local governments do not have a very clear idea for 
which specific expenditures they are responsible, or which 
sources they should use to cover those expenditures. 
  Taking the experiences of economically developed federative 
states (primarily the United States and Canada) as their point 
of departure, the World Bank experts propose as a first step 
that the list of expenditures for which local governments are 
responsible be clearly established, once and for all (with basic 
expenditures for social needs and capital construction brought 
back to the federal level). The next suggestion is to put all 
tax revenues in Russia from the basic taxes (income tax, profit 
tax and value added tax) in a single "pool" and clearly define 
what portion of that money will be sent to local budgets, and 
what portion will remain in the federal budget, based on the 
division of expenditures between budgets at various levels. It 
is also suggested that a portion of the money set aside for 
local budgets be shared between regions proportionally to the 
amount of taxes collected in each -- with the more economically 
developed regions naturally getting more. The remainder should 
be divided up between regions with the objective of levelling 
their economic playing field. It will also be necessary to get 
away from the excessive number of local taxes (those that are 
paid directly into the local budget), leaving only the most 
stable of them, primarily the land tax. 
  Also notable was the approach taken by the World Bank 
experts 
to differentiation of tax rates by region. They propose 
abandoning the current system, which allows the possibility of 
various profit tax rates being established in various regions of 
the country (in addition to the 13-percent tax that is paid into 
the federal budget, between 0 and 25 percent of profits may also 
go to the local budget based on a decision by a local 
legislative body). This kind of tax system creates a tangled 
"tax jungle" for business people, forcing them to choose not so 
much between various regions with varying prospects for 
profitable investment as between regions with varying tax 
systems. It is also proposed that we move to a differentiated 
tax system for personal income taxes (regions would simply be 
granted the right to collect regional surcharges over and above 
a unified federal income tax, with those surcharges paid 
directly into local budgets). If this were the case, every 
citizen would understand that he or she would have to pay a 
larger share of his or her income to live in a city with nice 
homes, schools and roads than in other regions (fully in keeping 
with American tradition, for example). 
  In addition the World Bank experts, while supporting a 
clear-cut and well-defined system of relationships between 
budgets at various levels, are also fully aware that Russia's 
government has a certain interest in an "ill-defined" system 
that makes it possible to present the federal budget to 
international lenders in a favorable light whenever one wishes. 
However, they assert that lenders will be quite understanding of 
the fact that reform of budget relationships between the center 
and the regions in Russia will worsen official budget indices, 
and consequently will somewhat reconsider their strict 
requirements with regard to macroeconomic indicators. 
  * * * 
<H5>  Commentary </H5>
  The recommendations prepared by World Bank experts are not 
seen as a fundamental reform of the existing tax system, but 
rather as proposals aimed at improving that system. 
Specifically, the attention of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts was 
drawn to the idea of efficient expenditures of tax revenues and 
reduction in the current number of local taxes, combined with an 
expanded role for land taxes. This idea is not new, but it is 
quite timely and (a point of some significance) it can be easily 
and painlessly implemented in Russia right away. For fairness' 
sake it should be noted that proposals that local taxes be 
reduced have been put forward repeatedly by Russian scientists, 
in particular by Academician Dmitriy Lvov and Professor Vladimir 
Frolov (see: KOMMERSANT-DAILY, 29 April), as well as by sections 
of the executive branch, i.e the State Tax Service and the 
Russian Ministry of Finance. It is easy to explain such rare 
unanimity: collecting these taxes is inefficient. With the 
possible exception of land taxes, the cost of collecting taxes 
to pay for things like parking or police often exceeds the 
amount of money actually collected. 
  However, in addition to some proposals that are quite 
self-evident, this report by World Bank experts also contains a 
number of proposals that are quite unexpected for the Russian 
tax system. For example, the thoroughly logical and justified 
idea of introducing higher taxes for residents of the most 
economically prosperity localities. However, under Russian 
conditions this innovation will most likely not lead so much to 
social justice (better living conditions as a result of 
additional funding) as to greater social tension, since -- and 
of this KOMMERSANT-DAILY's experts are quite certain -- an 
increase in local taxes will not result in any noticeable 
improvement in the quality of life in the immediate future. 
  Also of interest is the idea of establishing a standard 
level 
of payments into local, republic and federal budgets out of the 
sum total of all significant tax revenues. Previously tax 
revenues were paid out to the various regions at various rates 
(with the distribution of 1992 profit taxes particularly 
indicative in this regard). However, the proposal to support the 
most backward regions with the objective of "equalizing their 
economic position" will also be complicated in Russia due to its 
economic peculiarities: an additional infusion of money into the 
regions might just become another financial "feeding trough." 
  The World Bank experts took an untraditional approach to the 
widely proclaimed "regional independence" with regard to 
regulation of local tax systems. This time they were undaunted 
by accusations that they might be infringing on fragile Russian 
democracy and proceeded primarily on the basis of fully 
self-evident assumptions. However, it should be noted that tax 
rates still vary among the various states of economically 
prosperous America.

<F P=106> [Article by Konstantin Smirnov and Vadim Bardin under the </F>
heading "Export Regulation": "Quotas On the Way Out, But State 
Controls To Remain"] 
  [Text] Yesterday two consecutive events occurred which 
should pique the interest of Russian exporters. In the morning 
the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations board discussed a 
concept for a federal program of industrial export supports, and 
in the afternoon the government's commission on operational 
issues met and decided to change the mechanism by which export 
quotas are assigned. 
  This is not the first time that the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations has tried to use state incentives to improve 
the export structure. The board meeting focused on the 
objectives of a federal program to support machinery and 
equipment exports. 
  On 31 March 1993 the government approved the "State Program 
for Support of Machinery and Equipment Exports," which was 
developed by the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. The 
first version of the federal program, which differs from the 
state program in its specific request for allocation of budget 
funding, was presented to the government in October. However, 
the government took no action at that time. In December the 
draft federal program was sent back to the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations for additional editing. 
  The core ideas of the revised federal program are these: 
establishment of a precedent for budget funding of finished 
goods exports through creation of a lending, insurance and 
transportation infrastructure for industrial exports (including 
through the use of favorable tariffs). Specifically, these 
things are supposed to be embodied in the Russian Export-Import 
Bank, a controlling block of shares in which will belong to the 
state. On two occasions already, in July 1993 and January 1994, 
the government has passed a resolution establishing such a bank, 
yet at this time it exists only on paper. Suffice it to say that 
bank president Viktor Shilin, who was confirmed by the founders' 
meeting, is still working as deputy minister for foreign 
economic relations, i.e. despite the extensive history of this 
issue exporters of finished goods are still forced to solve 
their problems on their own. 
  The sad story of support for industrial exports brings to 
mind the thought that in the future Russia will be represented 
in the world market solely as a raw materials exporter. In view 
of that, the changes in the raw materials export mechanism 
announced at yesterday's commission session by Oleg Soskovets, 
are of primary importance. The commission granted non-ferrous 
metals and diesel fuel export quotas to the State Investment 
Corporation, which is headed by Yuriy Petrov. Hard currency 
revenues will go to a society for disabled Afghanistan war 
veterans. 
  In this way the case-by-case assignment of export quotas 
will 
be replaced by specific funding of their previous recipients' 
programs. Special-purpose export quotas will now go only to 
special exporters, who may in turn, in accordance with a 
decision by Soskovets' commission, transfer the hard currency 
received through sale of their export quotas (minus a 
commission) to non-commercial structures designated by the 
government. Thereby the government eliminates another means of 
exporting strategic raw materials that has easily evaded state 
supervision: use of public organizations that possess special 
foreign economic privileges and tax breaks. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations lobbied for this 
innovation, but the ministry has not yet succeeded in reserving 
the sale of special-purpose quotas for organizations under its 
jurisdiction. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations 
proposes that the new mechanism be extended to the assignment of 
special-purpose quotas and regional quotas, particularly since 
at the present time local governments are refusing them in favor 
of their own enterprises. The Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations has also drawn up proposals regarding a change in the 
mechanism for export shipments in connection with the state's 
needs, as supported by the government commission on operational 
matters. Specifically, it has been proposed that as of 1 January 
1995 state exports be restricted solely to fulfillment of 
intergovernmental agreements and protocols. At the same time 
export controls should be tightened, with these to be carried 
out in part by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The 
number of government special export agents would be limited to a 
single organization for each product category. 
<H8>  Changes in Export Regulation </H8>
<H5>  Immediate Changes </H5>
  Special-purpose export quotas will be assigned only to 
special exporters for the purpose of funding the programs of 
public non-commercial organizations designated by the government. 
<H5>  Long-Range Changes </H5>
  As of 1 January 1995 state exports will be restricted to 
fulfillment of obligations under intergovernmental agreements 
and protocols.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Glushchenko, candidate of economic </F>
sciences, RISI: "Two-Way Streets?"] 
  [Text] Beginning at the end of 1992 in the economics 
press and in business and especially among financial circles of 
Russia there has been an active polemic regarding access of 
foreign capital to our country's banking system. And the 
struggle between proponents and opponents of "intervention" in 
the domestic money-credit market today has moved on to the 
political plane and is raising havoc mainly in the corridors of 
executive and legislative power, including presidential 
structures. As we know, the next stage in the backroom battle 
involved in the determination of the role and position of 
foreign banks in Russia's financial system ended with a victory 
for the "isolationists" in the form of Edict of the President of 
the Russian Federation No. 1924 of 17 November 1993. There is no 
doubt that on this protectionist normative act, which caused a 
stormy reaction from the "internationalists," lies the stamp of 
political conditions related to the election campaign underway 
during this period, which certain domestic banking structures 
were able to take advantage of. But the discussion is continuing 
up to the present time. 
  More and more frequently voices are ringing out, 
including at the highest level, from people who are in favor of 
overriding or amending this presidential edict, which limited 
for the period up to 1 January 1996 the activity of foreign 
banks on the territory of the Russian Federation to operations 
with legal entities and individuals who are nonresidents of the 
Russian Federation. Perhaps even keeping in mind the fact that 
we are striving to become more open to the outside world and 
actively inviting foreign investors in (let us note that in 
practically all international economic or financial forums, from 
negotiations concerning entry into the GATT to backroom 
conversations at the session of the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development in St. Petersburg, the theme of 
"reciprocity" is present in one form or another), not a single 
objective economist will give a simple answer to the question of 
whether foreign banks are an evil or a good from the standpoint 
of Russia's national interests. 
<H5>  Internationalization As a General Tendency in the </H5>
Development of the Modern System 
  Internationalization of the credit and banking sphere, which 
is an objective consequence of the process of globalization of 
capital and the expansion and deepening of international 
economic relations, has become a most important factor in the 
entire system of the world economy today. The most significant 
role in foreign expansion of loan capital in the modern stage 
belongs to the largest banks of the United States, Japan, and 
the leading countries of Western Europe which, relying on their 
stable domestic positions, have become powerful credit and 
financial centers. Their activity is having an ever more 
appreciable effect not only on the credit-monetary and currency 
policy of developing countries but also on their overall 
economic policy. In recent years leading transnational banks 
(TNB) have been exerting an ever greater influence on the 
domestic political processes of their host countries. Let us 
recall that a most important factor in strengthening 
international expansion of banks of the United States and other 
developed countries during the 1970's and 1980's was the need 
for comprehensive credit-financial service for industrial TNK's 
[transnational corporations] which were busily expanding their 
activity on a global scale during that period. During all these 
years the rates of growth of revenues from the activity of 
foreign branches outstripped the profit from operations in the 
national market. Therefore even by the middle of the 1980's the 
proportion of the profit of American TNB's from international 
operations amounted to about 50 percent. As world practice 
shows, the development of foreign expansion of TNB's usually 
goes through three stages. Thus for the TNB's of the United 
States up until the middle of the 1970's the attack on foreign 
markets proceeded along the extensive path (quantitative 
increase in the number of foreign branches, encompassing new 
geographical zones), which corresponded to the period of 
internationalization of capital "in breadth." For the five years 
after that the prevailing tendency was internationalization of 
capital "in depth," that is, intensive penetration of TNB's into 
the national monetary-credit systems of the receiving countries 
in order to cover clients and functions of local banks, which 
was accompanied by an increase in the assets of the foreign 
branches. 
  In parallel, operations of TNB subdivisions in world 
financial centers have expanded and become more complicated. The 
first half of the 1990's, in our view, is characterized by two 
important tendencies in international banking: First, there is a 
further liberalization of national banking legislation on the 
plane of removing restrictions on the activity of foreign 
institutions within the framework of processes of deepening 
international economic integration on the global and regional 
levels; second, there is a marked growth of the number of 
takeovers and mergers in order to consolidate capital and 
enlarge the leading national banks as a means of protection from 
foreign competition and consolidation of their own international 
positions. 
<H5>  The Reality and the Prospects </H5>
  As of November 1993 there were 1,932 commercial banks 
registered on the territory of Russia, including 155 with the 
participation of "nearby" foreign countries and 15 in which the 
share of foreign participation exceeded 50 percent. In keeping 
with the "Conditions for Opening Banks with the Participation of 
Foreign Investments on the Territory of the Russian Federation," 
the maximum amount of foreign capital in the banking system of 
Russia has been set at 12 percent. Actually at the end of 1993 
it had not reached 8 percent of the total capital of banks 
registered in our country. 
  Among the vigorously functioning institutions with foreign 
capital one can include the International Moscow Bank (MMB). Of 
its joint-stock capital, 60 percent belongs to five European 
banks (of Austria, Germany, Finland, Italy, and France) and 40 
percent--to three Russian banks. It began its activity in 
October 1989, specializing mainly in operations in foreign 
currency and gradually expanding the range of services it 
offered. As of the beginning of 1994 in terms of assets (3.05 
trillion rubles [R]) the MMB occupied fourth place on the list 
of the largest commercial banks of Russia. 
  If one is to speak of banks with 100 percent foreign 
capital, 
one would have to single out the Austria bank, which in the 
autumn of 1992 was the first to receive a license from the 
Central Bank of the Russian Federation to open a branch in 
Russia. Beginning at this time this bank has operated on our 
market practically without competition from other foreign 
credit-financial institutions, since banks with French, Swiss, 
German, or American capital, which also had general licenses for 
the right to conduct banking operations on the territory of 
Russia, were occupied mainly with studying the market and 
investing in their own real estate, and they were unable to 
occupy real positions in the financial system of the Russian 
Federation until the president's edict was published. 
  According to estimates of specialists from this bank, the 
fears that the large Russian clients could switch their service 
to foreign competitors, if they were given a general license and 
the president's edict were overridden, are quite justified. But 
if in the near future activity in Russia were to be developed by 
such powerful and aggressive banks as Credit Lyonnaise, Societe 
Generale, Credit Suisse, BNP-Dresdner Bank, Citibank, and Chase 
Manhattan Bank, the outflow of solid clients from the Russian 
banks could start to avalanche. To all that has been said it 
should be added that several other large Western Banks today are 
waiting for licenses from the Central Bank of the Russian 
Federation, and about 100 "prospectors" with the rank of 
representatives could wish to be transformed into branches as 
soon as they can perceive any real advantage from such a step. 
<H5>  Russian Banks Abroad </H5>
  At the present time even for the largest Russian commercial 
banks the existence of foreign structures outside the CIS is an 
extremely rare phenomenon. At the level of branches there is 
Inkombank in Cyprus and National Credit in the United States. 
The latter has not really developed yet. Other banks must be 
satisfied with a few representative offices at best. Actually as 
of the beginning of the year only in Nicosia was there a 
full-fledged functioning branch of Inkombank, which rendered its 
clients a fairly broad spectrum of service: opening and keeping 
of current, savings, deposit, and other accounts; making 
settlements for export-import operations; insuring foreign 
trade, credit, and deposit transactions; managing free monetary 
funds; conducting operations on the money market and the capital 
market; organizing marketing research of trade and financial 
markets of the Mediterranean and Near Eastern regions. A 
representative office of the Optimum Bank has also been opened 
on Cyprus. (This zone in general is attracting the attention of 
Russian Businessmen because of the offshore conditions and the 
liberal legislation in effect there.) Inkombank also has 
representative offices in Frankfurt-am-Main (Germany) and Geneva 
(Switzerland). This same bank has an office of a legal 
representative in New York. The Stolichnyy Bank maintains a 
representative office in the Netherlands which it is planning to 
transform into a branch. 
  After the signing of the edict on restricting the activity 
of 
foreign banks on the territory of Russia the process of foreign 
"expansion" of Russian commercial banks began to falter. Taking 
advantage of bureaucratic obstacles, our Western partners are 
making Russia understand the principle of parity. Therefore, 
although formally local registration does not impede this, they 
are slowing up the consideration of documents for the 
transformation of the Geneva representative office of Inkombank 
into a branch and the creation of its subsidiary company in 
Germany. For the same reason Menatep and Kredit-Moskva cannot 
regulate similar problems in the United States and Optimum--in 
Switzerland. 
  In our view, the West does not always react objectively 
enough to the situation developing with respect to problems 
surrounding transnationalization of Russia's banking. Taking 
into account Russia's status as a "developing banking power" 
(the oldest commercial banks are only six years old), we could 
quite justifiably count on preferential conditions. 
Unfortunately, legislation in certain countries prohibits 
foreign banks that have been in existence for less than 10 years 
from opening branches. 
  Let us emphasize that respectable banking circles value 
their 
reputation very much. This closed corporate caste is unwilling 
to open its doors to newcomers. Unfortunately, in the West there 
is the widespread conviction that organized crime has 
significantly penetrated into Russian commercial structures, 
including the banking sphere. And Russia as a whole is in the 
category of countries with a high political risk for investments 
and long-term business partnership. 
  Speaking of quotas and the prospects of foreign expansion, 
one cannot forget about the existence in Russia of a network of 
former Soviet foreign banks which after the severe crisis at the 
end of 1991 were associated with the suspension of payments by 
the Foreign Economics Bank and significantly stabilized their 
position. Now more than 50 percent of their shares belong to the 
Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the rest are 
distributed among other banks. So in the future most powerful 
commercial banks could break into Western Europe and other 
regions by acquiring a controlling block of shares of these 
financial structures which are still under the control of our 
state. The advantage of these banks consists in that they are 
known in international business circles, they have a stable 
position in national markets of certain countries, and they have 
highly skilled personnel and good technical supply. 
  In solving the problem of the entry of Russian commercial 
banks into "more distant" foreign countries, an important role 
will undoubtedly be played by the Central Bank of Russia, whose 
leadership is frequently unjustifiably criticized because of its 
lack of an active position in negotiations with central banks 
and banking commissions of foreign countries regarding granting 
our credit institutions a most-favored-nation status. In 
parallel the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is 
reproached because it "poorly" protects the interests of the 
Russian commercial banks on the domestic market, granting 
preferential, almost offshore conditions to foreign competitors. 
Behind accusations of the Central Bank for "non-patriotism" one 
can frequently see objective selfish interests of individual 
Russian commercial banks which quite justifiably fear 
competition from the transnational banks of the United States, 
Western Europe, and Japan, which are considerably more powerful 
financially and more experienced on the professional plane. In 
this connection it should be emphasized that one of the main 
tasks of the Central Bank is to stimulate the overall 
effectiveness of the country's banking system, including through 
healthy competition. 
<H5>  `For' and `Against' </H5>
  Most frequently people look for an answer to the question of 
whether "to allow or not to allow" competitors from abroad into 
our country along the paths of analysis of the consequences of 
this kind of invasion for the Russian banking system and the 
country's economy as a whole. And if one is to indicate the 
extreme viewpoints, among the arguments "for" one can include 
the following: Foreign banks would have to bring with them 
century-old traditions, advanced technologies, high quality of 
service, professionalism, many years of experience in operating 
in developed monetary-credit markets of Western countries, 
obedience to the law, and along with all this incentives for 
healthy competition. 
  The arguments "against" are basically concentrated around 
the 
problem of "occupation" of the Russian market by financially 
powerful foreign banks which will quickly take over the young 
growth of national commercial banks and take key levers of 
administration of the domestic economy into their hands. 
  Many Western experts are insistently recommending to the 
Russian Government and the new parliament that they permit 
foreign banks to freely conduct operations in Russia. 
  During a business meeting of Russian and American bankers 
held in Washington in January 1994 the chairman of the 
Export-Import Bank of the United States, K. Brodie, expressed 
his negative attitude toward the restrictions introduced in 
Russia on the activity of foreign banks. He was supported by 
representatives of the Russian commercial bank Tokobank. On the 
other hand, the leaders of the Association of Russian Bankers 
and Inkombank advanced arguments in support of the president's 
edict. 
  On the whole this kind of polar attitude toward the given 
problem is typical of the banking environment in Russia. As a 
poll conducted by the bulletin "Russian Economic Barometer" 
showed, a negative attitude toward the idea of the presence of 
foreign banks in the credit and stock markets of Russia on a par 
with domestic ones was expressed by 55 percent of the 
representatives of the boards of the leading banks of 32 regions 
of Russia, 35 percent of the respondents were inclined to be 
positive, and 10 percent were neutral. This same poll also 
showed that large profitable banks with a permit for the capital 
were more inclined to fear foreign competition. It is known that 
such extremely large Russian banks as Most-Bank, Stolichnyy, and 
Menatep have a negative attitude toward removing the 
restrictions on the activity of foreign banks in the domestic 
market. A more restrained position is held by the banks Imperial 
and Rossiyskiy Kredit, whose leaders think that to close this 
sphere off to foreign competition is unthinkable while control 
and certain restrictions (but not as severe as are envisioned by 
the president's edict) are necessary. 
  There are marked disagreements regarding this problem on the 
high political Olympus of Russia. In civilized countries such 
contradictions are resolved through the normal legislative 
process and not "pirate" regulation of banking activity. It 
should be noted that attempts to regulate the situation and 
achieve a compromise have been made repeatedly. Let us recall 
that at the end of the summer of 1993 at a conference with the 
participation of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the 
government, and representatives of the commercial banks it 
seemed that mutual understanding had been reached. But soon 
there appeared the notorious letter signed by the president of 
the Russian Federation which presented amendments to the law on 
banking activity. As a result "pro-Western" sympathies began to 
be ascribed to the head of state on the grounds that he was 
against having foreign banks end up with "less favorable legal 
conditions than those of domestic banks." After the last 
November edict the vector of criticism shifted in the opposite 
direction. 
  The demand for protection of the national financial market 
is 
objectively justified, especially during the period of its 
establishment, but complete isolation from foreign influence is 
hardly reasonable. In this connection, in our view, the Central 
Bank of Russia took a fairly weighed position of "restrained 
liberalism" or "reasonable protectionism," with respect to 
accepting foreign investments into the banking sphere of Russia. 
This policy of "half-open doors" presupposes gradual access in 
doses for those foreign banks that have a stable financial 
position and an irreproachable business reputation. Recently in 
one form or another the question of the need to amend the 
president's edict has also been raised by members of the Cabinet 
of Ministers who are leaders of the leading economic ministries. 
During the time of the visit of the chairman of the state Duma 
to the United States he also expressed the idea that the 
presence of foreign banks in Russia is necessary for healthy 
competition. 
  There is no doubt that there is another aspect to this 
entire 
story. If the presidential structures and the government as well 
as the new parliament start to defend the interests of foreign 
credit-financial institutions too zealously they could lose 
support from a considerable part of Russian banking circles. If 
they strike in the other direction and take too rigid a position 
with respect to foreign bankers, many questions of trade and 
economic cooperation with the West, the attraction of foreign 
investments, regulation of foreign indebtedness, and Russia's 
entry as a full-fledged member into the international economic 
community could be appreciably aggravated. 
<H5>  What To Do? </H5>
  If the question of the need to attract foreign capital in 
order to advance our economy today no longer evokes even 
sluggish discussions (we are "for" and so far they are not very 
eager toward us), the problem of forming an infrastructure for 
their effective functioning should not cause such stormy 
negative emotions on the part of politicians and financial 
experts. 
  In the appendix to the message from the president of the 
Russian Federation to the state Duma containing a list of draft 
laws planned to be raised for discussion in 1994, No. 32 is the 
number the legislative act, "On the Banking System of the 
Russian Federation," which should determine the legal position 
of foreign banks in our country. Apparently it will be necessary 
to conduct serious hearings regarding this draft law so as to 
find a compromise on this problem that is acceptable to all 
parties. Otherwise the normative base of the most important 
economic sphere in the country will remain a field where there 
is play without rules, where lobbyists representing interests of 
individual involved financial groups will always end up in 
"fisticuffs." 
  And a last remark. A law "On Lobbying Activity in the 
Russian 
Federation," which was prepared long ago and was lost in the 
archives of the last parliament, should be immediately included 
on the list of legislative acts to be adopted this year.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Kalashnikov: "Post-Confrontation Europe: </F>
A Future That Is Here: Traditional Ideas Are Coming Into 
Conflict With the New Reality"] 
  [Text] One appreciable contradiction stands out in 
present-day Europe. On the one hand it is no longer separated by 
ideological and military-political barriers. A number of common 
principles, recorded in the Paris Charter of 1990, documents of 
the CSCE, and other multilateral acts, has been proclaimed 
throughout its expanse. The zone of European integration and, 
with it, the zone of particular legal, economic, and 
technological standards and provisions are expanding. On the 
other, the 45 countries located here--a record number for the 
20th century--are astonishing in their diversity of forms of 
state arrangement and political life and models of economic 
development, which has not been seen for a long time and which 
is, by all accounts, growing. Ukraine and Denmark, Spain and 
Estonia, Finland and Bosnia--these are just some of the "poles" 
of European reality, from which it may be seen that it is hardly 
any easier to impart to it a common denominator today than it 
was before the recent "great change." 
  The elimination in the East and the weakening in the 
West of bloc "discipline" has widened the way to 
individualization for the European countries. They are being 
prompted to take it by the aspiration to take advantage of the 
opportunities of independent development, but primarily by the 
need to adapt to the new conditions. Both are stimulating the 
cultivation of a new identity and compelling a fuller use of 
one's own potential with its frequently unique characteristics. 
National-state singularities, which previously were frequently 
blunted and suppressed even, are now being brought to the fore. 
The lifting of interbloc tension, democracy, and the market are 
causing a common complication of the European geopolitical 
landscape, by no means its alignment. 
<H5>  Three `Not's' </H5>
  The post-postwar situation in Europe is NOT a malfunction in 
the course of a history which failed to reach the 
liberal-conformist "end" predicted for it. It is a natural 
fleshing out by the forces and regularities that were unable to 
develop to the full extent in the rigid structures of the 
bipolar world. But the latent accumulation of these forces had 
not been interrupted. All the more strongly and unpredictably 
have they begun to influence the course of things following the 
end of the cold war. 
  The second occurrence is NOT the fate of the former 
socialist 
countries, which are clambering out of crisis with radically 
renewed economic and social structures, alone. Profound reforms 
are unfolding in states of the West also. Having liquidated the 
"iron curtain," the Old World has begun to change completely, 
according, what is more, to laws affecting it as an entirety, 
not only, for example, its more or, on the contrary, less 
prosperous parts. 
  Differentiation and fragmentation are NOT alien phenomena 
for 
Europe. High heterogeneousness combined with internal unity 
constitute one of its fundamental qualities as a particular 
geopolitical zone. But this unity consists not of the uniformity 
of this "superstructural" institution or the other but primarily 
of the existence of organic relationships among all its so 
dissimilar components. Such relationships have been generated 
over centuries and are often of a nonmanifest nature mediated 
many times over. 
  The unity of Europe is more fundamental than ideologies, 
blocs, and government policy. The erection of barriers or, on 
the contrary, centralized all-European structures camouflages or 
distorts its essence only to this extent or the other. 
<H5>  New Directions of Differentiation </H5>
  Following the achievement of a very relative consensus on 
questions that had hitherto constituted the principal material 
of disagreements, Europe has begun with redoubled vigor, as it 
were, to draw lines of demarcation in other spheres. 
Specifically, the spectrum of tasks of national-state 
development has widened. Today it incorporates, aside from all 
else, completion of the processes of unification (Germany), the 
surmounting of the consequences of division (the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia), the preservation of territorial integrity (Ukraine), 
and a change in international status (as yet neutral Austria, 
Sweden, and Finland). There have come to be more types of 
national-state strategies in Europe. It is not surprising that 
it is increasingly difficult to bring them together in a single 
channel. 
  The giant differences between individual countries in terms 
of length of sovereign existence and, correspondingly, maturity 
of state institutions have acquired new seriousness. The 
temporal horizon of European policy has lost its former 
evenness. Still strong "veterans" are living in direct proximity 
to the "newborn," among whom there are those who are near death 
also, most likely. 
  The ways in which certain European governments and leaders 
have come to power sometimes differ just as strongly as the 
Bible and a detective novel. While having become fully equal 
from the viewpoint of international law (there were previously 
certain reservations on this score in respect to the communist 
regimes), they nonetheless afford grounds for comparisons of 
their legitimacy and also the probable longevity of their 
position. All this poses anew the problem of the compatibility 
of legal systems and the ponderability and reliability of 
agreements and treaties that are concluded. 
  The culture factor is assuming ever increasing geopolitical, 
if not geostrategic, significance. It has been confirmed many 
times over in recent years that no fewer forces of rapprochement 
or repulsion may operate at the civilization level than in, say, 
the economic sphere. In addition, it is being recognized 
increasingly extensively that democracy in its canonical version 
advanced by the Council of Europe is part of a particular way of 
life and cannot take root in other cultural soil without 
detriment to both. Problems of the intrinsic value of all 
cultures, the preservation of which in their multiplicity is a 
prerequisite of the normal development, if not to say survival, 
of Europe, arise automatically. 
  It may be assumed that the forms of state and political 
arrangement which are destined to take hold and function in 
Russia will differ from the Western forms no less than our way 
of life from, say, the German way of life. But in this case 
anything more than the coexistence of these forms is hardly to 
be expected. Although they all fall into the parliamentary 
democracy category. This entire national-state mosaic, after the 
artificial "capitalist-socialist" counterpoise has been 
rejected, does not fit within either the dichotomy of the "old 
democracies-new democracies," "market economy-transitional 
economy," or "rich countries-poor countries" type or within a 
rigid framework at all. The increased internal heterogeneousness 
in international associations, including the European Union and 
NATO, and their actual expansion are making it impossible to use 
membership of them as a basic typological characteristic. A new 
European area-study typology based on the principles of 
objectivity and ideological neutrality is required. Small 
countries would, probably, prove to be a principal typological 
group. No less than three-fourths of the CSCE members situated 
here could be classed as such in Europe. Small countries, which 
have tangibly influenced the state of affairs in Europe as it 
is, are now proving to be a quite clearly expressed level of its 
post-confrontation architecture. Their similarity in terms of 
type of behavior and problems creates the basis for a kind of 
small-state solidarity, from which it is easy to switch to the 
coordination of joint actions. For the major European powers, 
Russia included, numerous small partners could prove a highly 
promising, albeit complex, field for new geopolitical strategy 
and tactics. 
<H5>  Dramatis Personae and Agents </H5>
  While having affirmed that the role and policy of states in 
Europe are changing considerably, it is essential, of course, to 
go deeper. That is, to the primary motives and energy sources of 
these changes. In other words, to the exponents of the interests 
or the participants in those same national interests which are 
usually discussed as a whole, whereas today they require an 
"address." The modern state and society are characterized by the 
increased assertiveness and autonomy of all their components, in 
respect to international affairs included. Especially if it is a 
question of today's European situation with its intensive 
modification of socioeconomic and political structures. 
  The role and correlation of the principal exponents of 
interests in the European countries is a fundamental question of 
their status and future development. Together with an area-study 
typology this could be a priority and most applied topic of 
European research. 
  We would point out by way of illustration that the structure 
and modus operandi of the elite of a united Germany will differ 
appreciably from that of the former Bonn republic. The changes 
have affected the holy of holies--the upper stratum of German 
banking business. The unprecedented infusions in the "new lands" 
($100 billion a year along federal lines alone) have lent 
impetus to a reallocation of roles and influence among banking 
groups. New people with new aspirations and styles have begun to 
make their way into this sphere also. What is to be expected 
from this, the near future will tell. It is noticeable as yet 
how in traditional German expansionism (both external and 
internal) extensive ingredients are beginning to supplant 
intensive ingredients. The imbalance in the giant financial 
mechanism is forcing an acceleration of political steps and not 
that sensitive an attitude toward the interests of European 
neighbors, and of many compatriots also. 
  Describing Russia as a riddle wrapped in a mystery, W. 
Churchill observed that there is a clue to this riddle in the 
form of Russian national interest. But judging Russian interest 
was simpler at that time inasmuch as there were before one's 
eyes merely several of its incarnations accommodated in Kremlin 
offices. For a serious analysis of Russian foreign policy today 
an in-depth knowledge of Russian society, which is in a state in 
which "only faith" remains, is required. The West has, 
seemingly, inwardly recoiled from the boundless and highly 
unfamiliar picture of the Russian cosmos which has suddenly been 
revealed. The reduction in the pace of rapprochement on the part 
of the former may partially be explained by this conceptual and, 
simply, informational insufficiency. Nonetheless, many key 
intra-Russian components are displaying a surprising stability, 
which is why the reforms under way here are in content closer to 
modernization. The role of the fuel and energy complex-military 
industrial complex duo is growing. Having regrouped, having cast 
off the jacket of super-centralization, and having united with 
the biggest banks, they will, most likely, increasingly 
assuredly influence Moscow's actions in the world arena. As 
before, they will need major external sales markets, better near 
than far. At the same time the pleiades of Afghan vets and 
politicized technocrats in the top leadership will for a long 
time, most likely, serve as guarantors against any adventures. 
It will not take these circles and groups long to ponder the 
nature of their overseas interest. The most concise description 
of Russian foreign policy in the coming years will be pragmatism. 
<H5>  Crisis of the Structural Genre </H5>
  All that has been said merely confirms that the existing 
international structures and institutions are subject to 
reinterpretation and adjustment. It would seem that the stage of 
the unswerving increase in the level of their integration in the 
direction of some "higher state" is played out. The need for a 
further increase in their supra-national character is 
increasingly being called in question in the top political 
stratum of the West European states. 
  European economic and political integration was conceived in 
certain "hard nuclei." The states belonging to them were 
particularly closely interconnected with one another and very 
close in terms of type of economic, political, and cultural 
development. The structures that they formed are genetically 
linked with this type, which, strictly speaking, limits the 
potential of their geographical expansion. 
  The European Union and the Council of Europe and, in fact, 
this "hard nucleus" now face a strategic dilemma: either to 
lessen the demands on the internal consolidation of the 
international structures and on the new members or to expend 
additional resources on an upturn in the general level of 
integration. The path of compromise is preferred as yet, by all 
accounts. The existence in the European Union of at least two 
integration "speeds" has been acknowledged and 
institutionalized, virtually. The preparatory institution of 
"candidacy" (association, "partnership," "specially invited 
state") has been instituted under various structures. 
  As distinct from the former political, more precisely, 
military-political, pressure along NATO lines, on the part of 
the United States, I should say, even the West European states 
will hardly succeed in sticking to a common integration course. 
A third version, no longer that hypothetical today, of a gradual 
transition of the leading role in respect to consolidation in 
Europe to Germany and, possibly, the Western European Union, is 
emerging. 
<H5>  New Geopolitical Paradigm </H5>
  A serious modernization of their conceptual and 
methodological resources is required of European politicians and 
researchers today. The former foreign policy thinking that took 
shape under the influence of the rivalry between NATO and the 
Warsaw Pact was based to a large extent on numerical ideas. It 
was mainly a question of a comparison of military and economic 
potentials in their various aspects. This was, so to speak, an 
"arithmetical approach" to all-European reality. The impending 
era requires a recognition of the growing specificity and 
interdependence of all parts and aspects of European life. Tasks 
of a qualitatively new level of complexity are coming to 
confront the researchers and politicians. Inertia in thinking 
and political practice rooted in the previous stage could under 
these conditions do its exponents a bad turn, but those who 
depend on their decisions even more. 
  As far as Russia is concerned, it is important for it today, 
in addition, not to lapse into conceptual dependence. The 
concentration of Russian geopolitical thought on the problems of 
international structure-formation could distract it from the 
rapidly developing European realities, from the new trends at 
the national-state level particularly. NATO and the European 
Union are and will for a long time yet remain for Russia "things 
in themselves." It will hardly ever have full-blooded relations 
with them. The CSCE is, like any club with a low admission 
requirement, incapable. The situation would change were it to 
interface with Western military-political mechanisms. But for 
Russia the same problems would then arise. 
  The "all-European" idea as presently crafted is barren in 
itself also. The cross-breeding of Central Asian and, say, North 
European interests within the framework of a 54-party forum is 
just as absurd as it is patently unproductive. The anemic 
post-Helsinki principles and institutions have been cast aside, 
virtually, by acts of struggle for a restructuring of Europe and 
the world. 
  Russia is persuaded on the basis of its own experience of 
the 
value of a direct approach to European affairs in their dynamic 
diversity and of the need for the retention of freedom of 
decisionmaking.

<F P=106> [Report by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA correspondent Aleksandr </F>
Sorokin: "Words Do Not Replace Might: View From Brussels"] 
  [Text] The Commission of the European Communities (CEC) 
held a seminar on the prospects of developing relations with 
Russia. Visitors from the CEC now descend on Moscow increasingly 
often. The newspapers are trying to digest the new Russian 
approach to NATO's Partnership For Peace concept. The press is 
attempting to analyze the possible consequences of Russia's 
entry into the European Union... 
  In short, one may say that in this respect our country is at 
the center of attention. Russian initiatives of late put Western 
politicians in a state of slight shock. To be precise, the 
confusion stems not from their contents but their inconsistency 
and contradictory nature. "We will not sign the NATO Partnership 
For Peace document..." "Actually, we will." "We will not demand 
special status for Russia within the framework of this 
concept..." "Actually, we will..." 
  So Western politicians are not in a hurry to comment on 
this. 
You say something in a hurry, call someone an unflattering name, 
and tomorrow this someone makes a U-turn... For Western 
journalists, however, it is a free-for-all. They are outdoing 
themselves in sarcasm on the subject of Russia's 
less-than-successful attempts to regain its former greatness. 
"This is not terribly smart," says one, and launches into 
pontification on the subject of chaos, and sometimes sheer 
incompetence, in the top echelons of Russian authority. "This is 
not by choice," another joins the discussion, hinting at a 
complex domestic political situation in Russia and increasing 
attempts by politicians of all colorations to play the card of 
Russian greatness. "It is neither," says a third. In his 
opinion, Russia has not rid itself of an imperial mentality, and 
all these swings from one extreme to another are nothing other 
than a desire to retain control over its former allies. 
  Here is a conversation, however, not with a journalist but 
an 
official representative of an official organization. 
  [Question] What do you think of Russia's intention to join 
the European Union? 
  [Answer] So far I only heard of such an intention from the 
press. 
  [Question] What if it were to be confirmed officially? 
  [Answer] I can say only one thing. Such an idea would be 
strange, to say the least. 
  [Question] What is your own view of it? 
  [Answer] Take, for instance, the 29 articles of the 
agreement 
on Austria's membership. How many years will be needed to reach 
an agreement with Russia, for instance, on social articles 
alone, if we have problems in this respect even with Austria?

<F P=106> [Interview with Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs </F>
Richard Spring conducted by Sergey Oleynik: "Relations Between 
Moscow and Dublin Are Excellent; Ireland's Minister for Foreign 
Affairs Dick Spring on the Results of Talks in the Russian 
Capital"] 
  [Excerpt] [Correspondent] Mr. Spring, how do you evaluate 
the state of Russian-Irish relations for the present day? 
  [Spring] I would characterize them as being very good, even 
excellent. I fully agree with my colleague, Russian Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Kozyrev, who said that the Declaration on 
Principles of Relations Between Ireland and Russia, which was 
signed in December of last year in Dublin, has not remained 
merely as an expression of our good intentions. Rather, it has 
become an important starting point for further specific work. 
During the visit by the Irish delegation to Moscow, we concluded 
an inter-governmental agreement on avoiding dual taxation 
between Russia and Ireland. This is very important for expanding 
our business ties, and especially trade. Despite its small size, 
in volume of trade with Russia Ireland has surpassed all the 
countries of the African continent combined. The trade turnover 
has grown most significantly during the past year--by 
approximately 7-8 times. Moreover, this has been due to Russian 
export. 
  We are very proud of the achievements of Irish business in 
your country. The "Irish House" on the Arbat, the "Duty Free" 
stores in the airports and hotels of Moscow and St. Petersburg, 
the "Garden Ring" chain of Moscow supermarkets and other joint 
Russian-Irish enterprises are operating and have won popularity 
among Moscow residents. And, most importantly, Irish businessmen 
have an optimistic outlook and are ready to expand their 
activity in Russia. Thus, at the end of May the "Eire Rianta" 
company, together with its Russian partners, is opening one of 
the largest trade centers in the capital, the "Valday Center," 
next to the "Irish House." 
  [Correspondent] Can you name specific new projects of 
economic cooperation between Russia and Ireland within the 
framework of inter-state agreements? 
  [Spring] We are planning to step up our cooperation with 
Russia on the program of technical aid by the EC [European 
Communities] to the CIS country--TASIS [not further expanded], 
in which Irish consultants and experts are already actively 
engaged today. First of all, this concerns the development and 
modernization of such sectors of the Russian economy as 
management, banking, the food sector, municipal management and 
the sphere of services. 
  During our meeting with Russian Vice Prime Minister Yuriy 
Yarov, he told of the steps which Russia was taking to enter 
GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade], and we offered 
our expert assistance. I believe this offer will be accepted. 
  [Correspondent] What are the political results of your visit 
to Moscow? 
  [Spring] Although our countries are located at opposite ends 
of the European continent, the positions of Russia and Ireland 
are very close on a broad circle of international problems. In 
the course of negotiations with Andrey Kozyrev, with whom, I 
might add, I also have good personal relations, we tried to 
strengthen the existing mutual understanding. In our opinion, 
Russian will play a very important and constructive role in the 
future of the European continent and, as I understand from the 
remarks of Mr. Kozyrev, Russia intends to do this specifically 
through peaceful regulation of conflicts, economic cooperation 
and active participation in the work of the CSCE [Council for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe], which we, naturally, 
support in every way. 
  [Correspondent] Upon completion of the negotiations in 
Moscow, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs thanked Ireland 
for its help in finalizing preparation of the Agreement on 
Partnership and Cooperation Between Russia and the European 
Union. Of what, specifically, did this help consist? 
  [Spring] I believe that I will not be committing a sin 
against the truth if I say that, in regard to this agreement, 
Ireland took a very active position within the framework of the 
European Union. We understand its great importance from a 
political and economic standpoint, primarily for stability in 
Europe. We worked very actively in the Council of Ministers of 
the EC and KEC [not further expanded], striving to conclude this 
agreement. Now, we are hoping that its signing is just a 
question of a few weeks. 
  Of course, we should not exaggerate the role which little 
Ireland is capable of playing in international affairs. But, as 
a participant country in the European Union, where the rule of 
consensus is in effect during voting, we are sure that our voice 
will be heard at the decision-making table, and that we can make 
our contribution to achieving general accord and mutual 
understanding. 
  [Correspondent] The chairman of the Russian government, 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, recently announced Russia's intention to 
enter the European Union. What can you say in this regard as a 
representative of a EC participant country? 
  [Spring] I believe that this is an interesting proposal. At 
the present time, a process of consolidation, or strengthening, 
is taking place in the European Union. We are hoping that in 
January of 1995 there will be an expansion of the EC--it will be 
joined by Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Then, a period of 
consolidation will inevitably follow once again. Of course, we 
are conducting negotiations on acceptance with the countries of 
the Vyshegradskiy group and other East European countries. If we 
speak of the long-term prospects, then, when the Agreement on 
Partnership and Cooperation with the Russian Federation is 
signed, then, based on it and having normal trade relations, we 
will be able to increase our ties. And after an appropriate 
interval of time we will make the decision as to subsequent 
steps. 
  [Correspondent] Considering the sad experience of the 
religious-ethnic conflict in Ulster, do you believe that the 
European states will be able to regulate the conflict in Bosnia 
and other inter-ethnic conflicts on the continent? 
  [Spring] I believe that today there are sufficient grounds 
to 
believe that the partnership between the EC, Russia, the United 
SA and the UN will bring the desired peace to the former 
Yugoslavia. Ireland was one of the first to support President 
Boris Yeltsin's proposal on holding talks on Bosnia at the 
highest level with the participation of these four parties. It 
is important to sit down at the negotiating table as soon as 
possible. When a direct discussion of the problem begins, it 
will not be too difficult to reach a general international 
position. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Vladislavlev, president of the </F>
Independent Foundation for Realism in Policy: "Russia's Foreign 
Policy"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Opinion </H5>
  A lot of claims are made in our domestic debates on foreign 
policy, but the direction of criticism, it seems to me, is not 
following a path that is entirely proper. The impression is 
created that it is being influenced by the old Soviet compass 
whose arrow always deviated toward abstract globalism and a view 
of foreign policy as a kind of chess game in which the moves and 
the maneuvers themselves were more important than the end 
result. In any case, it is impossible not to see that the 
magnetic lines of force of the past continue to hold us in the 
field of an artificial world view that has a rather weak 
association with the realities of our situation. 
  Russia is an absolutely new country even in its physical 
parameters: in the size and composition of the population, 
territorial configuration, and resources and capabilities. It is 
in another geopolitical position, and it has new neighbors 
virtually along the entire land perimeter. There has also been a 
fundamental change in the architectural outline of the rest of 
the world. Structures of force do not protrude as much, and are 
increasingly being pushed into the background by a complex 
economic framework. 
  It is precisely for this reason that it seems that the very 
first task of foreign policy is to realize the changes that have 
occurred and are occurring, and to understand their significance 
and consequences for the national interests of Russia. In turn, 
these national interests must be deduced not mainly from the 
past but from the future of the new Russia, in which it should 
occupy a worthy place in the higher league of world powers. 
There can be only one path to this objective--utmost realism in 
foreign policy. In the meantime, unfortunately, we have not yet 
set foot on this path. 
  The politicians are saying, to the point and not to the 
point, that Russia is a great power. The importunate invocations 
on this subject reflect not only a certain inferiority 
complex--which, however, is fully explained by the current 
unhappy state of affairs in the country--but, what is worse, 
this slogan is used to cover loss of face in the international 
arena, uncertainty of action, and lack of consistency, not to 
mention integrity of policy. 
  Moreover, I am more than convinced that the problems in 
foreign policy are associated first and foremost not so much 
with the situation in the economy of Russia as with the still 
unrepaired mechanism for making decisions in the state, the 
obvious muddle in the higher echelons of authority, and the lack 
of normal cooperation between departments. Russian diplomats are 
compelled to work in a mode of reducing damage to the country's 
interests. From this stems the desire to stand on the stilts of 
"great Russia." Although it is perfectly obvious that there is 
no sense to this. Russia does not need anything in recognition 
of its status as a world power. It has had such during the 
course of centuries. No one is refuting this now either. But 
whether it will be retained in the future is a question whose 
answer depends on us alone. 
  But our current behavior bewilders me, and at times arouses 
a 
sense of shame. It vacillates, as it did in the old Soviet 
times, between two poles--threats and ingratiation. Previously 
we were intimidated with nuclear war, now--with the collapse of 
Russia, a result that will be bad for everyone. Yesterday we 
were prepared to pay dearly for "class enemies" to receive our 
"general secretary" on a visit and show him first-class honor, 
today we are seeking membership in the G-7. Why? Probably in 
order that they show respect. 
  Is it necessary to think about this now? In my opinion, it 
is 
far more important for Russia to transform the CIS into a 
likeness of the Western G-7, to arrange real cooperation with 
the leaders of Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Belarus, and 
other Commonwealth states. It is with this that we should be 
occupied most of all, and not soliciting special status in the 
"Partnership for Peace" program. Unquestionably, we should join 
this program and set ourselves up there in such a way that 
Russia will be considered and its interests taken into account. 
  One is struck by the insensitivity of professional diplomats 
toward the falsity of the formula of conducting affairs with the 
United States "on equal terms." But, for example, relations with 
Lithuania or Burundi will not be built on "equal terms?" There 
is the generally recognized principle of reciprocity, which lies 
at the basis of normal interstate relations, and our inferiority 
complex is evident here. After all, we are not talking about 
reaching agreement with the Americans on a "treaty in which no 
one wins." Such things simply do not happen in international 
relations. 
  It is enough to look at how affairs are conducted in the 
West. What a sharp dispute arose quite recently between the 
European Union and the United States, especially between Paris 
and Washington about trade in agricultural products. The United 
States is not averse to establishing quotas on the import of 
Japanese automobiles and literally breaking into the 
communications equipment market in Japan with force. But we 
frequently see political discrimination where generally a normal 
fierce struggle is going on for markets. And it must be 
understood that no one will just simply yield their share of 
sales to Russia, especially in the arms market. Whining and 
complaining will not produce anything in this regard. 
  What we must persistently try to achieve is that the field 
on 
which the competition is being played is even for everyone and 
that the rules of the game for Russia are the same as for 
others. This, incidentally, will also show the true interest of 
the West in the success of our reforms and democratic 
reorganization. Symbolic charitable assistance not only does not 
produce anything, it casts a shadow on the purity of the 
intentions of our "benefactors," and, I fear, can even cloud 
mutual relations. 
  If by virtue of objective reasons we are not now prepared to 
compete with the West in some markets, then it is at least 
necessary for us not to give markets in CIS countries to others 
and also to fight for markets of the states of Eastern Europe 
and the Baltic countries. This is not a question of economics. 
It is only part of the main task of Russian foreign policy--the 
construction of a new system of mutual relations of states on 
the territory of the former Union. Herein lies the really 
vitally important national interest of Russia. 
  The priority of this specific direction is recognized by 
everyone, but unfortunately nothing of substance has been done, 
or is being done. Modern history does not know of cases in which 
any state would end up in a situation where there was a complete 
lack of regulation of its relations with a dozen contiguous 
countries, each of which was connected with it by a thousand 
threads--historical, political, economic, and purely human. The 
broken-up family was left to live in the same home, dividing it 
with plywood walls into separate apartments. But what about 
sewers and gas, electricity, and a common television antenna? 
Well, just as in normal life--sit down and come to an agreement: 
Who is responsible for this, how much, and who has to be paid... 
  The initial confusion can still be explained somehow. None 
of 
us were psychologically prepared for the new realities. Russian 
diplomats discovered that they knew New Zealand better than 
Ukraine or Armenia. Another psychological barrier arose: How to 
conduct affairs--according to kinship, or as with everyone else. 
  In principle, we now find ourselves in this position of 
diplomatic imponderability, although embassies have already 
appeared and relations have been somewhat formalized. Of course, 
they are far from the classical diplomatic forms. But it is 
already clear now that Russia will only be able to regulate 
affairs with its new neighbors within the scope of political 
negotiations in accordance with established world practice and 
on the basis of international law. 
  If all the unresolved problems with all the "old" countries 
are placed on one scale, and on the other, for example, only 
Russian-Ukrainian problems, the latter will turn out to be much 
heavier than the former. It is necessary to start here not just 
from zero but with big negative quantities. Only resentfulness, 
suspicion, and distrust remain from living in the Union 
community. Extreme nationalism, ethnic intolerance, mutual 
vindictiveness, and open hostility have come to the surface. 
This does not happen by itself. It is necessary to oppose the 
process of estrangement with a calm and patient search for 
normal cooperation on those questions that constitute mutual 
interest and provide a benefit to both sides. They lie almost 
completely in the sphere of economics. It must be said clearly 
that there can be no question of returning to anything similar 
to the old "communal life." The objective is the same: 
cooperation in the sphere of economics, without which neither 
Russia nor other states will pull themselves out of the crisis 
condition quickly. We are all linked to what was created as a 
monolithic economy. For the present, none of us have any other, 
and none other will appear soon. It is necessary to show common 
sense here and come to an agreement on the principles and 
specific variants of cooperation in both the sphere of 
production and in the sale of products. There can be only one 
basis for such cooperation--mutual interest. 
  However, if one is to be a realist, it is necessary to 
recognize also that Russia will have to be a donor in relations 
with at least some of its partners for some time. To what extent 
this is possible and expedient is another question. It is not a 
question of charity: Russia, possibly more than anyone else, is 
interested in the restoration of economic ties, in the creation 
of markets for its products, and in arranging broad trade with 
its immediate neighbors. It must also take the initiative in 
formulating questions of economic cooperation. Perhaps there is 
no more important task today. 
  Therefore, one can only be amazed when we lack not only our 
own initiative but we also do not have time to respond to the 
initiative of others. During his visit to Moscow, Kazakhstan 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev proposed the idea of creating a 
Euro-Asiatic union, an idea that is undoubtedly interesting and 
moves in the direction of developing the integration process. Of 
course, quite a few aspects arise here that require elucidation 
and further study. But to react to this important initiative 
with complete official silence--this is not simply 
incomprehensible, it is also ignorant. This kind of approach 
will cause us enormous damage, and casts a shadow on the 
readiness and desire of Russian diplomacy to conduct affairs 
with our most important partner respectfully and properly. There 
is a need here, I would say, for significantly more tact and 
attention than in the mutual relations with traditional 
participants in diplomatic exchanges. 
  Relations with the rest of the world can today be entrusted 
to the "autopilot" in significant measure--nothing will happen 
with them. Russia has a reliable treaty basis for the conduct of 
affairs with Europe, the United States, Japan, and other 
traditional partners, especially in the political sphere. There 
is experience, tradition, and professional personnel. Almost 
everything here is predictable, and it is most unlikely that 
there will be any big surprises. Russia is a permanent member of 
the UN Security Council, and this means that important 
international problems cannot be decided without it. Of course, 
it does not follow from this that activity must be lessened in 
the Western direction. Not in the least. Russia cannot help but 
participate in the most active way in worldwide problems: It 
cannot fail to work on disarmament problems, the settlement of 
regional conflicts, etc. Although here as well it is impossible 
to forget our own national interest--concerning integration into 
the world economic system. 
  The CIS countries are another matter. Here it is necessary 
to 
roll our sleeves up and display the maximum tact and attention 
to our new neighbors and partners. To be engaged in general, as 
is customary for us, but personally at all levels--from the 
president of the country to the most humble official in every 
department that has a bearing on these problems. It is fitting 
to talk here about cooperation on equal terms, demonstrating as 
much patience, understanding, correctness, and respect as 
possible. 
  Experience says that even small problems in international 
relations are not resolved immediately, and that time and 
persistent negotiations are required. But how difficult it is to 
build relationships essentially in a blank space. 
  I admit that I am intimidated by a package of documents that 
are being signed on the results of two-three meetings of experts 
and hour-long negotiations at a higher level. It is most likely 
that they will not produce results, and we already have been 
witnesses as to how documents that are formally prepared and 
hastily signed are quickly forgotten. 
  It is clear that Russian diplomats should defend Russia's 
interests firmly, but it is necessary to understand that their 
partners will act in the same way. An agreement can be born only 
as a compromise, as a balance of interests that are acceptable 
to each side. This cannot be done in an offhand way. 
  It is important now to begin negotiations on a whole 
spectrum 
of bilateral relations with each of our neighbors. To select 
competent negotiating teams and supply them with initial 
directives and instructions--and this will require competent 
interdepartmental consultations and agreements--to establish a 
procedure for interaction with the Federal Assembly, and to 
assign, naturally, the people and resources for all of this. 
Organized in this way, the negotiations will soon create their 
own inertia of movement, and will begin to produce results. 
  Time will decide the question about how, in the final 
analysis, we will begin to live further. But if Russia does not 
set an example and does not propose a settlement with its new 
neighbors according to international standards, then the 
centrifugal forces of history and the inertia of chaos will 
scatter us all in such a way that it will become simply 
impossible to maintain normal relations and communicate in a 
human way. I do not want to talk about worse and more 
frightening variants, but it is necessary to think about them, 
otherwise it is they that will come to pass. 
  I am very troubled by the leisurely manner and certain 
aloofness with which our politicians relate to what could 
determine the fate of Russia--to finding a safe, mutually 
beneficial, and humane method of life under new realities. It is 
necessary to remember that Russia's greatness is in its mission 
of reconciling the East and the West. The success of this 
mission will depend on the capability of Russia to play a 
constructive role in arranging new equal partnership relations 
in the Eurasian space.

<F P=106> ["Statement of the FIS Press Bureau," signed by Tatayana </F>
Samolis, press secretary of the director of the Foreign 
Intelligence Service of Russia] 
  [Text] In April 1994 a book appeared in the United States, 
by Ministry of State Security Lt Gen (Ret.) P.A. Sudoplatov 
("Special Tasks: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness"), which he 
coauthored with his son and the American Mr. and Mrs. Schecter. 
A whole section of the book is devoted to what the author calls 
"atomic espionage." Certain passages of this section are 
clearly intended to be sensationalistic. In this connection, 
the Foreign Intelligence Service Press Bureau considers it 
necessary to declare the following: Nuclear, and later 
thermonuclear, weapons were developed in the Soviet Union 
thanks, first of all, to the presence there of a powerful 
scientific-technical and intellectual potential. A large group 
of Soviet scientists made the decisive contribution. As for the 
contribution made by intelligence activity to developing the 
Soviet atom bomb, its important, highly skilled work played a 
significant role. Judging by the archive material which the FIS 
has, one can state that P.A. Sudoplatov's book "Special Tasks" 
is a jumbled mosaic of authentic facts, half-truths, and obvious 
fabrications. Special services usually avoid talking about 
their work and their concrete sources of information. However, 
in the case at hand, we consider it possible for us to declare 
that the assertion contained in the book--that Soviet 
intelligence received information about the atom bomb directly 
from such famous scientists as E. Fermi, L. Szillard, R. 
Oppenheimer, and some others--does not correspond with reality.

<F P=106> [TASS-KAZTAG report: "Kazakhstan-Iran: Mutual Aspiration to </F>
the Development of Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Questions of the trade and economic cooperation of 
Kazakhstan and Iran are the focus of the attention of the 
official visit to Tehran of Sergey Tereshchenko, prime minister 
of Kazakhstan. He is accompanied by a delegation which includes 
the ministers of energy and fuel resources and transport, the 
chairman of the Trade and Industry Chamber, the chairman of the 
National Bank, and members of parliament. 
  Speaking upon arrival at Mehrabad Airport, S. Tereshchenko 
emphasized that there are very close and friendly relations 
between Kazakhstan and Iran. He noted that a number of 
fundamental documents governing bilateral cooperation had been 
signed in the course of visits of the presidents of the two 
states to Tehran and Almaty. The main purpose of the present 
visit, therefore, is a stimulation of work on the fulfillment of 
agreements that have already been reached and the removal of all 
the barriers in the way of an increase in mutually profitable 
trade and economic cooperation. 
  Hasan Habibi, first vice president of the Islamic Republic 
of 
Iran, who met the Kazakhstani prime minister, confirmed his 
words. 
  Members of the Kazakhstani delegation and the minister of 
mines and metals of Iran took part in the first rounds of 
negotiations between Hasan Habibi and Sergey Tereshchenko. 
  S. Tereshchenko expressed the hope that the present visit 
would prepare the ground for the utmost expansion of bilateral 
cooperation in the economy and trade. He observed that 
Kazakhstan was interested in relations with Iran in such spheres 
as ground, sea, and air transport, trade in petroleum products, 
minerals, metal, and agricultural produce, and banking. 
  H. Habibi welcomed the strengthening of relations of the two 
countries. Touching on cooperation in the sphere of transport, 
he announced that direct air traffic between Tehran and Almaty 
would be inaugurated by the first flight between the two 
capitals on 16 May. The route will be served by airliners of the 
Iran Air national airline. The first vice president of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran pointed also to the importance for 
Kazakhstan of the building of the Mashhad (Iran)-Serakhs 
(Turkmenistan) Railroad. Following the commissioning of the main 
line and connection with the Bafq--Bandar-e Abbas Railroad, it 
will have acquired the shortest outlet to the Persian Gulf. 
  On Sunday the prime minister of Kazakhstan laid a wreath at 
the grave of Ayatollah Khomeyni, the founder of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. 
  The following day S. Tereshchenko and the members of the 
delegation he is heading visited the city of Isfahan and the 
islands of Qeshm and Qeys in the Persian Gulf. In Isfahan--the 
former capital of Iran--the leader of the Government of 
Kazakhstan viewed the sights of the city and visited the 
country's biggest foundries, one of which was built with the 
assistance of the USSR, which are located in proximity to it. 
There were preliminary negotiations on the possibilities of 
Iranian-Kazakhstani cooperation in metallurgy, by way of the 
exchange of technology and specialists included. 
  The islands of Qeshm and Qeys are free trade and economic 
zones, and this particular feature was taken into consideration 
at the time of the guests' negotiations with their authorities. 
Specifically, the members of the delegation inquired after the 
possibility of capital investments on Qeshm, whose 
infrastructure and location could be useful both for 
Kazakhstan's foreign trade and for the development of the 
republic's industry. Qeys is of interest primarily from the 
viewpoint of tourism, and for this reason the parties discussed 
on the island the prospects of interaction in this sphere. 
  The members of the delegation who remained behind in Tehran 
conducted intensive negotiations with representatives of Iran's 
business circles. On the establishment of bank cooperation, 
which would facilitate payments between commercial companies of 
the two countries appreciably, included. There had earlier been 
a meeting between Kadyr Baykenov, minister of energy and fuel 
resources of Kazakhstan, and Qolam Reza Aqazadeh, minister of 
petroleum of the Islamic Republic of Iran. They discussed, in 
particular, the possibilities of cooperation in the installation 
in Kazakhstan of an oil refinery and the construction of an oil 
pipeline.

<F P=106> [KAZTAG report: "Information Exchange--for the Common Good"] </F>
  [Text] The second conference of leaders of press agencies 
of Turkic-speaking countries has been held in Bishkek. 
Delegations of the ANATOLIA, TIKA (Turkey), TAK (Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus), KYRGYZKHABAR, and KAZTAG agencies 
took part. Representatives of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan were 
unable to make it to the capital of Kyrgyzstan for technical 
reasons. 
  The conference showed once again the enormous possibilities 
of concerted activity in the accomplishment of the common 
professional, technical, and financial tasks of the agencies in 
the pursuit of the domestic and foreign policy of the sovereign 
fraternal states. 
  The opinion that such activity should be shaped on the basis 
of the priorities of the official policy of each country, with 
regard to the documents and agreements adopted by their leaders, 
was expressed. It should be based on a desire to create an 
objective and multifaceted notion of the life of each country in 
order to counterpose its product to the alternative and 
frequently unscrupulous information structures. 
  The main direction of the cooperation of the united 
agencies, 
however, the conferees believe, is a concerted information 
policy, the coordination of the development and use of their 
professional and technological communications resources, and the 
joint defense of national interests in international 
organizations of the press and television, which would afford 
new opportunities for unrestricted and multilateral information 
exchange. 
  Decisions on financial and organizational questions of the 
subsequent activity of the joint agency of the Turkic-speaking 
countries (TKA), which was created last year at the first 
conference, which was held in Ankara, were adopted. 
  The participants in the meeting agreed to institute the 
publication of a joint bulletin, which would publish news of an 
economic and cultural nature. It would subsequently be 
disseminated in the world information space in English, German, 
and Spanish. For the realization of this project it is 
contemplated establishing a computer network among the members 
of the TKA. 
  The conferees were received by Askar Akayev, president of 
Kyrgyzstan. He supported the idea of the TKA being open for 
membership by the press agencies of other Turkic-speaking 
countries and emphasized that this was in keeping with the 
initiative of Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, 
concerning the creation of a Eurasian Union. Permanent 
information exchange, Askar Akayev said, will serve not only the 
rapprochement of peoples with common historical roots and 
cultural traditions but also the building of a new economy based 
on market relations.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Matlin: "Green Peas--the Bright Future of </F>
Machinebuilding? Paradoxes of Privatization"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Draw Swords! </H5>
  So what if we flopped in the triumphal building of 
communism? 
Now it looks as if we are building capitalism on one-sixth of 
terra firma strictly in accordance with "Das Kapital." 
  After all, only the ungrateful Germans are ignoring the 
advice of their compatriot. They are even conducting 
privatization unscientifically, not in a capitalist way. They 
take an enterprise in the East sector. They spend a lot of time 
on it, restructure, forecast its development, arrange for 
countless expert evaluations. And only then privatize. And even 
that is done by bid. 
  We do it differently. We charge like a cavalry through the 
pages of the "Short History of the VKP(B) [All-Union Communist 
(Bolshevik) Party]" and--onward to capitalization! 
  ...Some functionary up there, at the "top," probably grunted 
with satisfaction when he saw on his desk a report on the GShM 
[mining machine-building plant] plant. Let us face it--not too 
many of our enterprises choose the "capitalist" road when 
converting to joint-stock ownership--the first option of 
conversion. And here a whole plant does so! In the center of the 
Urals. A plant that builds mining machinery for "hard currency 
export" sectors. 
  One has to admire the GShM leadership's sacrifice, bordering 
on martyrdom. It was their director Davydov, of all people, who 
accomplished this change in psychology. He invited a 
progressive-thinking expert to the general meeting on the 
subject of choosing the stock-conversion option. He passionately 
lobbied for the first option. He courageously criticized the 
supporters of the "kolkhoz-mentality" second option, which the 
public favored until the very last moment. Nobody can doubt the 
altruism of his design: A little later the "pre-privatization" 
director resolutely stepped down to make room for the new choice 
of owners--the stockholders. 
  In short, it seems that everybody should be satisfied now. 
The GShM proletariat--with its consciousness. The former 
"administrators"--with their foresight and altruism in the name 
of progress. And the owners of the controlling share of 
stock--with a lucky purchase, right? 
<H5>  Reverse Coup </H5>
  What can one say about the plant's new "helmsmen"? Alas, 
almost nothing. They chosen to modestly remain in the shadows, 
do not accept congratulations, and refuse contact with the media. 
  All that is known is that at the auction (the lion's share 
of 
GShM stock was sent to the voucher auction to be sold to 
investors) two small companies decisively ruled the ball: the AO 
[joint-stock company] "Evolventa" and the TO [trade association] 
"Ark." Together they acquired more than one-third of the plant's 
stock, appraised at 17 million (??!!) rubles [R]. Then they took 
in as a founder the "Evoluta" company and combined their votes. 
Moreover, in some inexplicable way "Evoluta" received an 
additional 20-percent package--bringing the total to a 
controlling share--from the hands of the staff of the oblast 
committee for the administration of state property. 
  According to the rules, this structure could transfer the 
stock for voting to its representative. At the GShM they thought 
it would probably be someone from the plant or the committee. 
They were wrong. As the oblast committee staff explained to 
naive GShM workers: "The country has taken a course towards 
capitalization. So this is the way it is." 
  This is how, without a single shot or explosion, a coup took 
place at the GShM. A coup in reverse: Unlike 1917, this was a 
denationalization of property. 
  As in every coup, there was a "state of emergency" at the 
GShM--an emergency meeting of stockholders was called by the 
"Evoluta" management, using their rights and the trump card of a 
hefty bundle of stock--both theirs and state-owned. 
  The plant workers were about to convene their "constituent 
assembly": The plant's public organizations started writing a 
customary "agenda" for stockholders' meetings, with "reports" 
and "prospects." Contenders for the director's job, including 
the former director, began sweating on election programs and 
promises. None of this was needed, however. 
  As soon as the meeting opened, the owners of the controlling 
share--just like in 1917--asked straight out and firmly: Who is 
the provisional government here? And Mr. Davydov's job was taken 
by V. Oshmanov, the head of one of the now-combined companies; 
V. Chashchin, the head of another firm, took charge of the board 
of the newly baked GShM AO. Thus, the key posts were taken by 
"Evoluta" representatives. 
<H5>  Economizing on People... </H5>
  With the advent of the new GShM owners, innovation soon 
came. 
  First, the newly baked director put together a personal 
protection team. Plant workers looked with some apprehension on 
the muscular lads that began appearing at the plant. Then the 
personnel department learned to its surprise that a new, until 
then unheard-of, staff position had been established: deputy 
director for economics and labor. The people at GShM attempted 
to interpret this innovation in their favor: The new authority 
is giving a clear hint, they said, that from now on the plant's 
economics will be subordinated to the interests of the working 
man. 
  The new authority, however, had a somewhat different view of 
how to resolve "labor issues" at the plant. Since December the 
majority of plant personnel have been sent en masse on 
protracted leave, and a thick layer of undisturbed snow has 
settled near the gates. 
  Who was left? One can glean this from the sparse lines of 
the 
director's order: "My deputies, production department directors, 
and department and services directors remain on the job." Not 
all of them, however, only those "responsible for preparing the 
annual report." The payroll window is also practically closed, 
saving money for the plant. In principle, weeks-long leave was 
nothing new at neighboring state enterprises, too. The kicker, 
however, was that GShM personnel were not even receiving the 
two-thirds of the salary due them. 
  Trade union leader A. Kovshov, who also volunteered to 
participate in the resolution of "labor and economy" issues 
(began to protest against the new arbitrariness), quickly had 
his oxygen supply cut off: His trade union boss's pass was 
simply confiscated at the gate. 
  As a result, some workers went to look for a better deal at 
other enterprises; many others were simply fired under different 
pretexts and in violation of the law. The decision on the mass 
"discharge" strangely coincided in time with the protest sent to 
the enterprise administration by the Kirovskiy Rayon procuracy 
(in the course of checking the trade union committee chairman's 
complaint, the procuracy staff to their utter surprise 
discovered a host of glaring violations of the law). 
  It is good, of course, that we are coming back to market 
relations now instead of, for instance, serfdom. Every worker is 
at least absolutely free to change profession and place of work. 
As soon as he is told: You are free!--he just goes and changes. 
  What do we do about housing, though? 
  Like every self-respecting plant, GShM had its own "communal 
digs." The plant's housing department still remembers with 
pleasure how they held the first place in the rayon. 
  "Now one sometimes cannot help but laugh. Through tears," 
clarifies A. Shirgazin, housing and household services 
department chief. "The plant has a special machine with a lift 
basket: To knock icicles off the roof in the spring. Now it is 
kept locked up, and this time we had to turn to the fire 
department for equipment. We had some things issued from the 
warehouse--you will laugh, just some gloves--and got stopped at 
the gate like thieves; they say it is not permitted. We are now 
economizing. The new bosses have given me clear hints several 
times: Your department simply does not exist for us. This is 
obvious even without the hints: Not only are workers not paid, 
but money for municipal services is not forthcoming either. 
Organizations are sending us threatening ultimatums: We will 
turn off the water, elevators... And are gradually moving from 
words--warnings--to actions." 
<H5>  A Supermarket Plant </H5>
  In the advance issue of ZAKAMSKAYA STORONA the newspaper had 
a laudatory ode to privatization, which was still forthcoming at 
the time. The GShM was mentioned as an example of an entity 
ideal for navigating stormy market waters: flexible modifiable 
production; its own foundry and forge shop. Traditional 
customers are the rich pillars of domestic industry. They bring 
foreign currency to the country and are not living in poverty: 
gold prospectors, oil industry, potassium production. They 
cannot do without Perm. You want an oil drilling rig 
transported? Only GShM makes (or rather, used to make) 
transporting machines. And how do you reload potassium ore 
without Kama equipment? Also, no way. Or dig gold-containing ore? 
  In short, with such a potential of production and 
distribution--wow!--even in our times one can live well. Or can 
one? 
  One of the new director's first orders was to sell off in 
the 
shortest amount of time all the stockpiled reserves of 
production materials. 
  Deputy General Director L. Gubanov was told to sell R220-240 
million worth of boiler oil, dispose of R50 million worth of 
weighers kept in the warehouse, and get rid of R54 million worth 
of copper wire. All this was being sold off because of... "lack 
of means for purchasing production resources." 
  Such a bold sellout can hardly be explained by a lack of 
needed cash. This is true. There is a nonpayments crisis and 
such everywhere... But there also are foundry orders long paid 
for by the oil industry; there is another score of generous 
die-making proposals. And at the same time the foundry is idle. 
And then gets a strange order: sell off tonnes of liquid 
glass--a material in most acute shortage, without which no 
casting can be done. The foundry workers are not being paid 
wages and expect to be laid off. 
  Instead of trolleys with ingots one began to see in 
warehouses carts with cans of green peas, tomato paste, boxes 
containing television sets, furniture, plywood... The scale of 
the current production process at GShM can be seen again by 
reading the director's orders: "Upon arrival, sell R250 million 
worth of foodstuffs." 
  Previously unfamiliar words became a part of the plant's 
lexicon: "babki" [dough], "lemons" [R100,000]... 
  Well, of course, the financial sphere is very important. 
Really, really important! 
  But then perhaps the new owners, by imposing strict 
economizing on production and social services, by conducting 
bold multistep food-and-rug operations, are striving to 
accumulate financial potential, and will suddenly present the 
country with an abundance of mining machinery, which will take 
the domestic raw materials sector, and the oblast budget, 
straight into the stratosphere? 
  We do not know. We would like to have a heart-to-heart talk 
on this subject with director Oshmanov. Except that he 
absolutely refused. All we have is sparse food for thought: GShM 
recently tried to sell its own... rail station. 
  As is known, one cannot transport by truck even the smallest 
mining equipment of the kind the plant manufactured until 
recently. On the other hand, perhaps the new "industry captains" 
are secretly working on the development of pocket prime movers 
and mining microcombines? 
<H5>  Here We Are... </H5>
  If one is to believe the original sources, even God, after 
creating the world, was not above regularly sending his 
representatives to earth--to see whether everything was going on 
there in accordance with the divine design. 
  Could the oblast committee for the administration of 
property 
delegate its man to the meeting where it was being decided who 
would head this rather sizable plant? It could. His vote, with a 
sizable package of voting stock in hand, could be a decisive one. 
  They did not delegate anyone. Even out of curiosity. 
  Those sweet Germans! They conduct their restructuring. Spend 
time on scientists, solicit bids. Organize tenders, selecting 
reliable investors instead of fakes who are only out to skim off 
the cream. I wish we had their problems...

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Demchenko: "Ministry of the Economy to </F>
Take Over Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations?" 
  [Text] Alexander Shokhin, Minister of the Economy, may 
become the most influential and powerful figure at the highest 
body of executive authority. 
  Confidential sources have revealed that the government has 
prepared a draft resolution on the merger of the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations (MFER) with the Ministry of the 
Economy (ME) of Russia. If this happens, the Ministry of the 
Economy, which is already the most powerful government 
department in Russia and is not accidentally compared to the 
former State Planning Committee, will get the most prized piece 
of the Russian economy as its subunit. In this way Alexander 
Shokhin will become a figure almost as influential as Viktor 
Chernomyrdin -- with all the political, economic and other 
consequences arising therefrom. 
  Several circumstances that have made Viktor Chernomyrdin, 
who 
maintains good relations with the MFER's present-day head Oleg 
Davydov, come to favor this variant. Despite the premier's 
sympathies for Davydov, Russia's foreign economic activities 
cannot be described as too successful. In January-February of 
this year foreign trade turnover declined by 8 percent (12.7 
billion dollars) in comparison with the same period in 1993. 
Exports, it is true, increased by nearly 3 percent, but this 
growth took place against the backdrop of the continued fall of 
world prices. Imports dropped by more than 27 percent (3.8 
billion dollars). According to eyewitness reports, these facts 
are often reported to the premier by vice-premier Alexander 
Shokhin, who, as a result of the latest redivision of powers in 
the Council of Ministers, supervises this department. 
Relationships between Shokhin and Davydov are characterized as 
"very strained." 
  Sergei Glazyev, who was forced to resign his post of 
Minister 
of Foreign Economic Relations last year, and now heads the State 
Duma's Committee for Economic Policy, sent Viktor Chernomyrdin 
an official document with the results of the parlimentary 
hearings, sharply critical of Oleg Davydov's work. It is 
characteristic that his committee's recommendations are based on 
the postulate that in 1992 the MFER under Glazyev's guidance 
developed a plan for foreign economic activities, which is not 
being followed now. As claimed by MFER employees, there were no 
significant differences between Glazyev and his deputy Davydov 
at that time. Today, however, the former minister, on the basis 
of parliamentary hearings, has presented a serious bill to his 
former subordinate on points dealing with accounting and control 
over foreign economic activities which he himself did not manage 
to organize during his tenure. Of special interest is that at 
the end of the recommendations Glazyev suggests on behalf of his 
committee that the government "examine the possibility of the 
MFER's merger with those subunits of the Ministry of the Economy 
of Russia which deal with foreign economic activities." 
  The premier's decision is unlikely to be seriously affected 
by the recommendations of the parliamentary committee. But they 
are significant on the political plane: for the first time 
Sergei Glazyev, who has until now acted independently, 
demonstrates his alliance with Alexander Shokhin, and, moreover, 
on a fundamental issue. This may indicate a growth in the 
"shadow" authority of Shokhin who in the event of the MFER being 
stripped of its independence would then become the most powerful 
and influential figure at the highest executive body. 
  If this happens, it will perhaps be possible to consider the 
path traversed by Alexander Shokhin during four years from being 
the Minister of Labor in Silayev's government, the connections 
he acquired and the prestige he earned during this time both at 
home and abroad to be the standard even in such a fantastic 
country as ours. 
<H5>  Forecast of Foreign Economic Activities Based On The Figures </H5>
of the MFER of Russia 
  Foreign trade in 1994 is expected to equal 70.5 billion 
dollars, that is, practically at the level of 1993. 
  Export. The overall volume of export is predicted 
to equal 44 billion dollars (43 billion dollars in 1993). 
  The export of raw material commodities for state needs in 
1994 is envisaged to equal a billion dollars or 25.5 of the 
total volume of export of raw material goods, technical 
assistance -- 1 billion dollars. 
  Imports. The total volume of imports in 1994 may 
come to 26.5 billion dollars (27 billion dollars in 1993). 
  The forecast of the import of basic commodities and services 
of vital importance for the country's economy and social sphere, 
given the funds of the federal budget, is estimated at 4 billion 
dollars. Moreover, in 1994, it is likely that goods will be 
purchased to fulfil the federal raw material programs and other 
state needs. 
  The import of raw materials and supplies on account of the 
state budget is expected to amount to 1.8 billion dollars, plant 
and equipment -- 2 billion dollars, building services -- 0.2 
billion dollars.

Territorial Agency of the Federal Administration on Insolvency 
Matters (Bankruptcy) in Novosibirsk Oblast: "The Law on 
Bankruptcy: How To Assist Debtor-Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Under conditions of a general slump in the 
volume of production, the result of a myriad reasons, a majority 
of large state enterprises and enterprises in which there is a 
share of state property face the need to find ways of surviving. 
Many are not up to the task. 
  Of course, objective reasons are being felt to a significant 
degree: First and foremost, the reduction in the state order for 
products of the military-industrial complex. 
  There are subjective reasons also. The managers of many 
enterprises continue to set their hopes on assistance from the 
Ministry of Finance, branch ministries, and various 
authoritative structures, instead of working in an earnest way 
on actual conversion themselves, while attracting nonstate 
investments. It is understandable that in attracting outside 
investors (including foreign investors), the management of an 
enterprise ends up under their additional control. Not everyone 
likes this. Others simply do not want to part with any benefits 
that generally do not depend on the results of work. Up to the 
present, substantial nonproduction expenditures exist at a 
majority of enterprises, and there is an unjustifiably big gap 
between the wages of managers and those of the rest of the 
personnel at a number of enterprises. The results of unskilled 
management are well known--concealed unemployment, insolvency of 
enterprises, a breakdown in communications, etc. As a result, 
there is an increase in the dissatisfaction of the population 
threatening a social explosion. 
  The conduct of a state policy directed at preventing the 
bankruptcy of state enterprises and reducing state expenditures 
to support insolvent enterprises has been entrusted to the 
Federal Administration on Insolvency Matters (Bankruptcy) and 
its territorial agencies. 
  Supporting enterprises, in the event that the Court of 
Arbitration considers them insolvent, will be implemented either 
by means of reorganization (the conduct of external 
administration of the debtor-enterprise, or financial 
restoration of the enterprise), or by means of opening 
competitive production. Also possible is the conclusion of an 
amicable settlement between debtor and creditors in accordance 
with the Law of the Russian Federation "On Insolvency 
(Bankruptcy) of Enterprises." The law provides a procedure for 
the assignment of an arbitration supervisor with wide powers to 
a debtor-enterprise. At the same time, a moratorium is 
introduced as a form of support for the period of outside 
administration to satisfy the demands of the creditors on the 
debtor. But if a capable supervisor himself is unable to pull an 
enterprise out of debt, the enterprise can be declared bankrupt 
and is subject to sale in a competition. In this case, benefits 
for the labor collective can be envisioned as conditions of the 
competition. 
  The Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation has 
developed criteria for the adoption of decisions on rendering 
state support and financial restoration. Coming under state 
support are enterprises that: produce products, or are able to 
produce products after receiving state support; presently have 
or will have market demand in the next year or two; are capable 
of improving their production, economic, and social indices; 
produce products at prices that satisfy the market; do not 
excessively raise wages for their workers; do not needlessly 
increase profits and prices for products; and employ, or will be 
able to employ, advanced technology after receiving support, 
including ecologically safe technology. A very important 
condition for rendering state support is the presence at the 
enterprise of a technically and economically justified plan of 
measures for improving the health of the enterprise (financial 
restoration project). 
  Considering that check privatization is coming to an end, 
many insolvent enterprises are given a chance to acquire 
additional financial means through the mechanism of conversion. 
Inasmuch as some of the money obtained from the sale of state 
property will remain at the enterprise that has been reorganized 
into a joint-stock company. Of course, the shares of a 
debtor-enterprise will be bought up only in the event a 
well-studied development program is available. In this case, the 
territorial agency is called on to perform the role of an 
expert, because the interests of the state as the owner are 
involved here. 
  It should be emphasized once more that the task of the 
territorial agency, as well as of the entire Federal 
Administration on Matters of Insolvency (Bankruptcy), is not to 
supplement the budget by liquidating enterprises, but to assist 
insolvent enterprises in acquiring financial independence. The 
resources of the federal budget and branch and interbranch 
off-budget funds will be directed to this end.

  [Text] 
<H5>  Food Production Is Declining, While Consumption Is Growing </H5>
  Food production in our country continues to drop, while its 
consumption, to grow. 
  In the opinion of Alla Moshkina, a leading scientific 
associate at the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of 
the Consumer Market and Marketing, in 1992 Russians passed the 
lowest point of decline in food consumption (2,400 calories per 
day). In 1993 there was a small increase (2,600), and in 1994 
(2,700) our ration will exceed the 1991 level. True, calories 
represent a gross indicator, which is not very indicative of the 
crux of the matter. As in bygone days the quantity of steel and 
wool did not guarantee the appearance of reliable combines and 
fashionable blouses, so the number of calories is not an 
indication of good nutrition. Most Russians have a food ration 
of a carbohydrate nature (they eat bread and potatoes more often 
than meat and milk). However, little by little the consumption 
of livestock products is also increasing. For example, in 1990 
Russians consumed 6.3 kg of meat and meat products per month, in 
1991, 5.8, in 1992, 4.8, in 1993, 5.2, and in 1994 (according to 
forecasts), 5.5. Furthermore, the consumption of vegetables 
should be restored this year and that of fruits and berries will 
even exceed last year. True, our previous nutritional level is 
not a standard. In 1990 a Russian consumed 49 grams of animal 
protein per day and in 1993, 39.7, while the recommended norm is 
55.7. 
  However, in Alla Moshkina's opinion, the general trend, 
nevertheless, is favorable: Food consumption will grow slowly 
despite the reduction in its production. The population's 
gradual adaptation to new market conditions, rapid growth of 
production on private subsidiary plots, direct trade, from 
vehicles, by agricultural producers, expansion of trade by 
private individuals (especially from near abroad), an economical 
expenditure of food, and, of course, import are the main reasons. 
<H5>  The Most Unpleasant Trend: Day-to-Day Goods Are Becoming </H5>
Fewer 
  The washing away of relatively inexpensive day-to-day 
goods--milk, vegetables, potatoes, sour cream, and frozen 
fish--and their replacement either with expensive products, or 
simply with any junk, are the most unpleasant trends noted on 
the food market recently. 
  The paradox lies in the fact that the country is overflowing 
with food raw materials (in many regions stocks for 1 month and 
longer have accumulated) and there is a big demand for them, but 
primarily the processing industry prevents those that want to 
sell, for example, milk and those that want to buy it from 
making contacts. This is the "bottleneck" on the consumer 
market. Monopolism, technological backwardness, the habit to 
dictate terms both to producers of agricultural products and to 
consumers, and high, but "eaten through," profits--the food 
industry would be happy to preserve such a situation for a long 
time. Imported food is in the way. It simply forces it out from 
the market. 
  This forces food industry workers to make a move. And it is 
worth making a move. According to Alla Moshkina, technologies, 
for example, for the quick freezing of 40 types of fruits and 
vegetables were developed in the country as far back as 15 years 
ago: Take and use them. 
  Trade, like the food industry, is not very concerned about 
the impoverishment of the assortment of inexpensive goods and 
their disappearance; in part, because to trade in potatoes every 
day is a more labor-intensive occupation than to doze near a bar 
of imported chocolate for 1 month. Moreover, it has been noted 
more than once that trade "circulates" the money made from the 
sale of potatoes or milk instead of returning it to processors 
and agricultural producers. 
  If it is impossible to count on administrative measures, in 
Alla Moshkina's opinion, only an increase in prices of basic 
necessities can bring them back to the counter. It will be 
necessary to pay "bread" and "milk" money, that is, subsidies to 
consumers, but, nevertheless, to release the prices that, for 
the most part, are maintained. True, a stereotype has already 
been formed in our country: If oil prices are released, this is 
a new step on the path to the market and, if bread prices, this 
is a knife in the back of reforms. 
<H5>  Triumphal March of Imported Food Throughout Russia and Its </H5>
Consequences 
  Imported food is rapidly expanding the geography of sales 
and 
the trade assortment. 
  In March alone regular trade in imported pastry and fruit 
cakes in private stores increased from 60 to 87 percent, in 
chocolate, from 87 to 93 percent, and in chicken legs, from 13 
to 53. 
  The market is simply saturated with some imported products, 
for example, chocolate, but the rise in its prices has stopped. 
  However, unfavorable trends are also present here: There is 
an expansion in the assortment of goods that are not most 
essential and not of the highest quality. Researchers say that 
Italian canned meat and Danish sausage have already acquired the 
steady status of "those that are disliked." 
  Still, domestic producers have a serious chance for success. 
Consumer patriotism safeguards them. According to observations, 
in Germany's eastern lands an unequivocal preference for 
imported food lasted 3 years, but in our country tastes, 
possibly, will change even more rapidly--if a serious domestic 
competitor is found. 
  A curious situation has emerged on the market of domestic 
candy and chocolate. "Mishka kosolapyy" [Pigeon-toed Mishka] and 
"Krasnaya shapochka" [Little Red Riding Hood] appeared in stores 
(in the same wrappers, which our fellow-citizens pasted in 
family albums in order to preserve them in historical memory), 
raising a storm of nostalgic feelings in the souls of Russian 
consumers. It seems that "Gusinyye lapki" [Crow's Feet] and 
"Rakovaya sheyka" [Crawfish Tail], which sank into oblivion, 
have been added to them, but in new attractive wrappers. Judging 
by surveys, people of the older generation unequivocally prefer 
former Soviet candy and caramel. If confectioners remember the 
provinces, to which "Gusinyye lapki" have not yet returned, the 
widest sales market will open to them. 
  Everyone--confectioners, dairy industry workers, and 
margarine producers--can count on consumer patriotism if they 
begin to produce high-quality, tasty, and beautifully packaged 
products. 
<H5>  It Would Be Good To Eat Not Only Well, but Also Correctly </H5>
  It is interesting that in our country there are problems not 
only in the "practice" of the diet, but also in "theory"--more 
accurately, in ideology. 
  In the Western world the theory of a balanced diet, which 
requires the purification and refining of products, has long 
been defeated by the theory of an adequate diet, which insists 
on the preservation of basic natural components. (In luxurious 
Western restaurants dark unrefined sugar or bread with bran will 
be served without fail to you). However, our consumers seem to 
get stuck at the crossing from one theory to another; all the 
more so, producers, from whom the new diet ideology will require 
new technologies. 
  However, according to the data of surveys by the All-Union 
Scientific Research Institute of the Consumer Market and 
Marketing, our patriotic consumer, at the same time, is very 
amenable to the appearance of new products on the market; for 
example, soybean protein, or spring water. 
<H5>  Who Is Short of What? </H5>
  Judging by surveys, needy families experience a shortage of 
the most essential goods, that is, milk, sour cream, pot cheese, 
onions, and garlic, which are "washed away" from the assortment. 
  Average and highly paid population groups would like to have 
constantly on sale fresh and frozen fruits and natural juices 
(especially in winter), dry fruits, cheeses, buckwheat, 
Krasnodar tea, mayonnaise, and live fish... 
  High-income families are short of fine grape wines, fruit 
and 
chocolate creams, black and green olives, fillet steaks, caviar, 
and bitter chocolate. 
  The distribution of preferences seemingly does not contain 
discoveries, but there are curious exceptions. 
  Research by the All-Union Scientific Research Institute has 
shown that Russian students are perfectly well familiar with the 
assortment of imported chocolate and often buy it by no means 
out of considerations of prestige, but simply to satisfy their 
hunger; as before, cabbage pies.

<F P=106> [Article by Anna Politkovskaya: "Will Russia Become a </F>
Switzerland?: Marginal Notes in Connection With the Signing of 
the Social Accord Treaty"] 
  [Text] So will our own internal Switzerland, tranquil, 
understanding everything, blaming no one, pacifist, and 
maintaining strict neutrality, but eaten up by no one thus far 
because of this, emerge here? This is, of course, the question 
of questions for Russia today. While our native political 
scientists are attempting to gather their thoughts, Russia's 
journalists have been attempting to answer it as quickly as 
possible. 
  The very next morning following the ceremony in the Kremlin, 
IZVESTIYA introduced to the political vocabulary the terms 
"signatory" and "nonsignatory," which is, in fact, what is most 
important in the situation that has been created around the 
latest exercise of the president, who is an acknowledged expert 
at creating difficult situations, from which subsequently all of 
society begins to emerge with clatter, noise, and losses. 
IZVESTIYA recalled the "moral and political responsibility" 
which would undoubtedly ensue from a violation of the articles 
of this treaty. Otto Latsis, a member of the editorial board, no 
longer recalls, it would seem, in presenting material on this 
topic the country's recent past, when any "moral and political 
responsibility" seamlessly flowed over into criminal 
responsibility and there came to be added in parallel with a 
criminal investigation the skillfully organized public 
persecution of individual citizens who at the due moment either 
had not signed something or had suddenly been taken ill or had 
failed to put in an appearance somewhere or had simply remained 
silent at a plenum, congress, presidium session.... 
  IZVESTIYA quotes Gennadiy Zyuganov, a "nonsignatory," to the 
effect that "there is no need for any special agreement, it is 
necessary merely to observe the constitution of Russia." Say 
what you will, the words of the principal communist of 
present-day Russia appear perfectly justified, whereas the 
"barbs" of the principal political observer of a respected 
mass-circulation newspaper are sincerely distressing. This is 
what O. Latsis writes, arguing with G. Zyuganov: "...observing 
the constitution formally, sociopolitical tension--by, included, 
demands for a review and revision, perfectly legitimate in form, 
of this constitution and various sociopolitical demands, which 
are so easy to make at a time of crisis--could be incited." It 
is worth recalling that this is that same Latsis who just a few 
months ago was assuring society in that same paper of the acute 
need, without delay, for the adoption of Yeltsin's draft 
constitution inasmuch as it, the draft, was, at least, good. 
  Deliberately brushing aside the "nonsignatory" and, hence, 
antipresidential, which sounds for it almost like an 
anti-Russian, thought movement, IZVESTIYA inveighs also, for 
example, against the demands of the Political Council of the 
Russian Democratic Reform Movement in respect to the possibility 
of the signing of the treaty: "Such demands reek of populism." 
The word "reeks" is, you will agree, painfully familiar to 
Soviet hearing. In addition, it has to be recalled that it is 
none other than Yeltsin himself who is the recognized leader of 
modern Russian populism, and if anyone is to be accused of 
anti-Yeltsin sentiments, the subject of "populism" should not 
even be broached here--this is a loser for the president. 
  The position of another "nonsignatory"--the Agrarian 
Party--is pilloried by IZVESTIYA as a "self-interested 
approach." The entire self-interest amounts to the fact that the 
agrarians are refusing to sign the treaty on the grounds that it 
omits the sectoral demands of the agro-industrial lobby. But on 
what other grounds could they, in fact, reach accord or not? But 
the newspaper writes: "Hardly anyone could fail to understand 
this, and if he does understand it and still insists on getting 
his own way, we should take a close look at the motives of such 
actions." Let us scrutinize what are, in our opinion, the key 
words of the sentence--"should take a close look." These began 
also many frightening government and newspaper campaigns of the 
USSR against the individual, did they not? As we know, in time 
society and the publications had great moral difficulties 
"washing off" the involvement in these campaigns. How much did 
that same IZVESTIYA have to confess its restructuring to 
Solzhenitsyn and to Rostropovich and to Sakharov and to other 
citizens of our fatherland who were innocent sufferers. O. 
Latsis concludes his article entirely in the spirit of the 
Brezhnevite editorials: "The fact of nonsigning is just as 
eloquent as the fact of signing." But should everything begin in 
the country so expressly from scratch? 
  The position of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY differs from that of 
IZVESTIYA, but the difference is merely that ARGUMENTY I FAKTY 
produces a real tear-jerker. In the opinion of Vladimir 
Savichev, "What is that thing held in common for the sake of 
which the president is calling for accord? Primarily the 
interests of Russia and its people, strong authority and a 
strong economy. It is those who do nothing and who are 
responsible for nothing who do not want to `reach accord' 
today." And the author goes on to use altogether impossible, 
even disgraceful words, it would seem: "V. Zhirinovskiy, leader 
of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], may be viewed 
variously, but he cannot, in any event, be denied one thing--he 
speaks clearly and pleasingly (!?--author's comment) for the 
hearing of ordinary people." 
  It is significant that many newspapers representing the 
interests of various political currents and movements, while not 
coming to terms, have expressed themselves in the spirit of G. 
Zyuganov, the leader of the communists, looking, perhaps, the 
most respectable of all in the current situation. And this is 
very indicative inasmuch as the further we go, the clearer it 
appears that the only thing we will derive from the present 
stage is the communists in the saddle once again and profound 
disenchantment with the democrats in power. NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA 
GAZETA (correspondent Yelena Afanasyeva) writes about this 
disenchantment: "I happened to hear at the Kremlin entrance a 
discussion of the preparations (not so much for the signing as 
for the banquet) by two officers of the security service: 
`Plenty of vodka. They'll sign on!'" Was that really how things 
were THERE! The information concerning these "retainers'" 
maxims, which are of considerable importance for an 
understanding of Kremlin psychodynamics, is borne out fully by 
the newspaper SEGODNYA--the vodka is explained there by a 
"senior guard to a junior guard," and the whole action takes 
places at the Tsar Bell. And, further: "Social accord is even a 
very remarkable thing, particularly if it is more or less clear 
to society whom the contracting parties represent. The chosen 
line of political behavior is very reminiscent of the rash 
Soviet `ostrich' principle--ignoring the large-scale phenomena 
of life going beyond the framework of the ideologically 
acceptable picture. Ostrich-like instincts are understandable in 
human terms, but historical experience testifies that when the 
head is buried in the sand, it is very difficult to observe 
reality." 
  All this clearly shows the exclusively theatrical nature of 
the action, which we might, of course, have guessed, but it is 
better to know, this having been permitted us by the reporters 
admitted to the scene of the event. 
  PRAVDA, as an exclusively opposition spokesman, was even 
more 
definite on this score: "The immense number of signatories 
creates the illusion of the unity of political forces in the 
country. This is not in fact the case. This should force the 
president to wonder: Why? So with whom was the treaty signed? 
Between the president and the people or his own entourage? The 
outcome of a survey reveals an interesting newspaper breakdown: 
On the one hand, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA, 
IZVESTIYA, TRUD, ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, and many other publications 
which unconditionally supported the presidential side. On the 
other, NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA, SEGODNYA, KURANTY, PRAVDA, 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, KOMMERSANT-DAILY.... 
  All newspapers were united only on one point, perhaps--for 
the first time they made forecasts concerning the future of the 
treaty. The most interesting were published, in our view, in 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY. The author of the first is the well-known wit 
Maksim Sokolov, and this is what he writes: "From the cynical 
viewpoint, the process of the redivision of power and property 
in Russia is approaching completion--evidence of which is the 
constantly declining level of inflation--and the result of the 
revision is peace." The author of the second is the paper's 
policy department: "There is no reason to suppose that Boris 
Yeltsin, who is persistently molding the image of `father of the 
nation,' will himself now constantly be pointing the finger in 
the direction of the nonsignatories, attempting to make of them 
his adversaries, and publicly dividing society into `good 
fellows' and `bad fellows'. But it cannot be ruled out that the 
`radicals' in his entourage--the politicians that obtained 
offices in the Kremlin on the wave of opposition to Mikhail 
Gorbachev or the Supreme Soviet--will not involve themselves in 
this. At least, they would acquire in the person of the 
nonsignatories actual opponents, attacks on whom would not, most 
likely, evoke their boss's displeasure. The treaty is simply the 
latest product of the official ideological machinery, which, 
probably, needs somehow to justify its existence. It may be 
assumed with every confidence here that it will hardly prove 
more effective than the previous food programs and antialcohol 
campaigns." 
  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS' forecast is definite and tragic: 
"None of the signatories believes that the treaty will prevent 
any trade union boss striking in the near future or regional 
forces becoming fixated with unbridled separatism..." (Yuriy 
Zaynashev, author). KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA adds fuel to the same 
fire: "The probability of the treaty soon being forgotten cannot 
be ruled out. Much now will depend on the press. The president 
is entrusting to it the duty of keeping an eye on compliance 
with the terms. Well, we are used to this sort of thing. And we 
have survived" (Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin, author). 
  Let us sum up: Despite the multitude of words uttered by 
everyone, the treaty is still more the outward appearance of a 
process than a process itself. In a week or a month the 
president will rest content with the first--this has happened 
before. Primarily because this business imposes on him 
personally precisely no clear obligations. But as long as the 
outward appearance continues to be observed, some people might 
very much have to pay for it even. Sanctions against both the 
"nonsignatories" and the "signatories" will be applied, and this 
is clear even now, primarily by the press. So, colleagues, be 
vigilant, do not treat that seriously all that you hear from the 
Kremlin, be in no hurry to carry out an order--remember the 
immortal Schweik--for the direct opposite could follow.... 
  [begin box] 
<H5>  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA Pact </H5>
  Yes, we have a plan for the conclusion of a corporate High 
Pact. Let them have their treaty, we will have--for simplicity 
of distinction--a pact. This idea was suggested to us by the 
social emanations about which M. Leontyev spoke so splendidly in 
the newspaper SEGODNYA: "The will to accord, more, to its 
formalization on paper, is very clearly gaining momentum at the 
present turn of social life," which we had, of course, to have 
heard. Taking up a position in the rear of this modern 
phenomenon, we offer our colleagues a draft Pact on the 
Procedure of Coverage of the Social Accord Treaty in the 
National News Media. It is just two sentences long; discussion, 
therefore, will not be protracted and will create a real 
opportunity for the general signing of the pact the day after 
publication of this issue. So, our version: "Journalists 
subscribing to the pact shall categorically refrain from 
propaganda of the division of society into `signatories' and 
`nonsignatories.' The list of subscribers to the OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA Pact is open, beginning 6 May." [end box]

<F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniya Mikhalevskaya: "Custodian of the </F>
Press: Why Do We Not Like Him?"] 
  [Text] Approximately a month ago Boris Sergeyevich 
Mironov, the new leader of the Russian press, made the Russkaya 
Kniga Publishers an offer they could not refuse. He insistently 
recommended that the publishers accept for production Shulgin's 
work "Why Do We Not Like Them?" 
  THEY are the Jews. WE are Russians with a capital "R," who 
recognize our national affiliation as a most valuable Christmas 
present of fate. Thus dear Boris Sergeyevich and the Russkaya 
Kniga Publishers (against their wishes to some extent) are 
intending to present reading Russia with the advocacy work of a 
most dazzling national Black Hundred figure, who contrived in 
postrevolution exile to admire Stalin for his imperial labors, 
return to the Union, serve the obligatory 10-year stretch, and 
remain true to his love and his hatred. 
  It should be mentioned immediately that Boris Mironov was 
for 
the past two years (until his appointment) director of Russkaya 
Kniga and that he continues to exert a particular influence on 
the business prospects and future of this establishment. 
Nonetheless, not one regular employee of the publishing house 
agreed to edit this urgent work and append his name to the 
publication particulars. Some suggested that the following be 
set up on the title page: "Publication recommended by the 
Committee of the Russian Federation for the Press." 
  A statement of fact--the chairman of the Committee of the 
Russian Federation for the Press is, in fact, involved in the 
publication of literature sowing national discord--is 
inevitable. And he is doing this, what is more, while remaining 
beyond the reach of incensed cosmopolitans since there is not a 
single written document recording his direct participation in 
the publication of the said work. There is only the verbal 
evidence of people dependent on him. And, as indirect proof, the 
trifling matter of Shulgin's piece of research, so important for 
the fate of Russia, having arrived at the printer's (Book 
Factory No. 1, city of Elektrostal) in circumvention of the 
usual publishing cycle. The client, as we were informed in the 
production department of the book factory, is Russkaya Kniga. 
  Boris Sergeyevich Mironov is undoubtedly a politician of the 
new wave. He pronounces the word "Russian" emotionally and, 
judging by his numerous radio and television appearances, is 
thinking seriously about how to reconstitute Great Russia. He is 
a particular traditionalist, if account is taken of the 
exclusive Russian tradition of official functionaries of the 
highest rank reckoning their appointment as nothing other than 
an inscribed pass into high politics. Simultaneously considering 
it possible for himself to adhere to exclusively personal and 
intimate political views. The opinion, which is approved 
throughout the world, that a public servant should be a 
proponent of the official ideology is considered an anachronism 
fit for satisfied European countries. In the mercantile language 
of the payroll, pay is computed for Boris Sergeyevich Mironov in 
order that a state which customarily calls itself democratic 
ensure "freedom of speech and the independence of the press...," 
but Boris Sergeyevich, appearing on television, has the 
following interesting words to say: "Such concepts as democratic 
principles, democratic canons--they are incomprehensible to me. 
I believe that they are once again trinkets and toys which are 
being used unscrupulously today in democratic and other 
political games. I believe that we should be guided not by some 
democratic reaction; we should be guided by common sense aimed 
at just one thing--the same thing for which I like Stolypin. 
Aimed at a strengthening of the state, a strengthening of 
Russia. And Russia can be strengthened only via the authorities. 
Strong authorities mean a strong state." 
  Russia, as we all know, can be strengthened in various 
ways--the choice of pit-prop facilities is broad enough. But if 
account is taken of the passion of the chairman of the Committee 
of the Russian Federation for the Press for strong authoritarian 
power, the press will soon be having to be guided by his common 
sense. In this case, we are simply compelled to analyze the 
personal attributes and level of practical potential of the 
committee chairman. 
  So, then, Mr. Mironov negotiated the illustrious path from 
trainee at KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA to correspondent of PRAVDA. He 
has preserved his commitment to his paper--he named it as being 
among the papers constituting the "national information field 
which we are accustomed to calling central...." It is to these 
papers--PRAVDA, TRUD, and so forth--"whose name has become a 
symbol of Russia"---that Boris Sergeyevich intends giving budget 
monies first and foremost. He was, as we have already mentioned, 
director of the Russkaya Kniga Publishers (the former SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA Publishers). In 1993 he published the novel "The 
Madman," as the principal practical hero of which he portrayed 
one Mikhail Nikiforovich Poltoraivanov, the correspondent of a 
central newspaper. Boris Sergeyevich scrupulously delineated his 
practical hero in rich, lively, and evocative manner. With vivid 
touches and Tolstoyan periods. He did not employ camouflage 
inasmuch as the recognizability of the prototype was obligatory. 
It is rumored that Poltoranin was made fun of somewhat after the 
novel's appearance. Of Boris Sergeyevich, no. Because if a 
person does such a thing, he has, consequently, good reason to. 
  Boris Sergeyevich had the novel published in the friendly 
Respublika Publishing House. It is not that important, of 
course, that the composition was supervised in the P.F. Anokhin 
Petrozavodsk Printer's by an employee of the Russkaya Kniga 
Publishers, that the publication particulars contain the name of 
no editor at all, that the technical editor was an employee of 
Russkaya Kniga also, and that the novel was printed from slides 
at Book Factory No. 1 in the city of Elektrostal. In which the 
product of Russkaya Kniga is usually printed, but by no means 
that of the Respublika Publishers, which has its own Krasnyy 
Proletariy Printer's. It is an absolutely trifling matter that 
the paper also was allocated from Russkaya Kniga stocks. We do 
not doubt, of course, that everything was paid for punctually 
and that an agreement with Respublika was signed and drawn up 
properly. It is foolish and trivial even to demand that a book 
by the director of a publishing house travel the customary route 
of a manuscript submitted for publication and that someone there 
decide whether it has a right to be published or not. Following 
this skewed logic, it could be demanded that vendors of the meat 
department stand in line for meat. 
  The next step in the career of Boris Sergeyevich is the 
office of chairman of the Committee of the Russian Federation 
for the Press, which was formed on the hallowed ground of the 
Ministry of Press and Information and the sporadically 
rebellious Federal Information Center. 
  B. Mironov set forth his exclusively professional (and in no 
way political) principles at a news conference in Moscow, which 
caused quite a sensation. Boris Sergeyevich gave the appearance 
there of being an energetic and fair individual, but, 
unfortunately, contradicted himself somewhat: "I do not get into 
political banalities," Mr. Mironov said, "and this is our 
purpose, we pursue a sectoral policy, purely professional...." 
That is, Boris Sergeyevich announced that the committee would be 
objective, like the Moon, which simultaneously illuminates the 
road and the victim and the robber. But he observed immediately 
here that he would with pleasure impose moral censorship, and to 
the question as to whether "...the Committee of the Russian 
Federation for the Press intends monitoring observance of 
publications' political trustworthiness and subsequently 
dictating what should be written and how," he announced that 
"...of course, we will recommend, heeding our 
recommendations--that is your business...." We would recall that 
Boris Sergeyevich's first recommendation--to OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA--took the form of an official caution, not heeding which 
was quite difficult. Would have been, had it not been for the 
verdict of the Appellate Court for Information Litigation, which 
sets aside the caution. 
  But the biggest discrepancies occurred not at the level of 
the word but of the level of the view. Of Boris Sergeyevich's 
view of life. Boris Sergeyevich spoke at length, for example, 
about Alla Yaroshinskaya, calling her for some reason or other 
an ordinary Zhitomir journalist (in our age of democracy, 
evidently, ordinary Zhitomir journalists can win an alternative 
Nobel Prize and become a member of the Presidential Council), 
and juggled, to put it mildly, facts connected with the "Atomic 
Encyclopedia" which she is publishing--initially in a public 
interview, then at the news conference. But this is not the 
point. Mironov's conflict with Yaroshinskaya and its clear 
political underpinnings (Boris Sergeyevich is afraid of 
competition since there is in the Office of the President a plan 
for the creation of an official structure for assistance to the 
press, which was to have been headed by Aleksandr Yakovlev and 
Alla Yaroshinskaya) were illustrated in detail by IZVESTIYA of 
31 March 1994. Exposing Yaroshinskaya as a publisher and 
accusing her of theft, Mr. Mironov observed that he himself had 
attended the school of director of a publishing house and had 
been accustomed in this field to earn everything down to the 
last kopek independently. The trouble is that this is not 
entirely the case. The Russkaya Kniga Publishers, which Mironov 
left, not only has not prospered since his directorship but 
finds itself, according to the workers of the publishing house, 
in an extremely difficult financial situation. Each employee of 
the publishing house has been issued a list of books whose print 
run has not in practice sold out--so that the employees might 
take part in the distribution as best they can. 
  The list contains approximately 30 titles, and, according to 
employees of the publishing house, this is 60 percent of the 
entire print product on which Russkaya Kniga has been working 
these past two years. The books are filling up warehouse 
premises, and the publishing house, lest it pay money for 
storage, has been forced to undertake acts of charity and to 
give them out free of charge. Since it was made clearly 
understood to us that the decision on the publication of this 
book or the other would always be made by Mr. Mironov himself, 
it is, naturally, he who bears the responsibility for all these 
problems of the structure he has left. In addition, during Boris 
Sergeyevich's directorship there were several further odd 
episodes at the publishing house permitting doubts as to 
Mironov's theory concerning honestly earned kopeks. The business 
of the calendar published by Russkaya Kniga for a large Siberian 
plant acquired a certain notoriety even in publishing circles. 
The large industrial enterprise, which has trade relations with 
foreign partners, decided to conclude with the publishing house 
a contract for the publication of the "Old Russian Book 
Miniature" in order that 3,000 copies of the calendar might be 
published bearing the plant's proprietary symbols. During the 
negotiations, which took place in March of last year, Mr. 
Mironov informed his clients that the publishing house was in a 
difficult material situation. In this connection the plant 
undertook to pay for the entire print run of 20,000 copies. And 
not simply to pay, what is more, but to prepay. The calendars 
(so that they could be sold) were to have been delivered to the 
enterprise absolutely no later than August. But on Mr. Mironov's 
initiative the documents did not specify a precise deadline. "We 
are civilized people," Mironov said, "you will get the calender, 
I will not say on time, but sooner...." 
  "Mironov was full of enthusiasm," plant representative 
Yelena 
D. told us. "We were shown a calculation with regard to all the 
types of taxation--the production cost of each calendar amounted 
to R800. The contract was signed in April--No. 20 of 12 April 
1993. Some 16 million were paid into the publishers' account 
within a week, and--total silence ensued...." 
  Subsequently the situation unfolded in most villainous 
fashion. The calendar was not ready either in July or in August 
or in September. To all questions there was just one answer--it 
is being printed. Then... it dries up. At the start of October 
the representative of the plant was issued 15 copies of the 
calendar and told that, considering the inflationary processes, 
the prime cost of a copy would be R3,600. And this meant that 
the plant could expect merely its own 3,000 calendars with the 
symbols, while the rest would remain at the publisher's. "I then 
demanded a new calculation," Yelena D. told us, "I wanted to 
know where this increase in the price had come from. It was 
brought me--for `our' 3,000 copies. It said that the paper had 
been purchased in mid-April--why, then, was it so expensive? The 
chief accountant was summoned. She said: No, this is the wrong 
paper, it is not intended for this calendar. The appropriate 
people were hastily assembled, and I was given another set of 
figures--based on a cost of one copy of R2,700. 
  "To make a long story short, I realized that we had simply 
been cheated. At that time, in the month of April, Mr. Mironov 
probably needed money. He had, evidently, wasted it on something 
or other. In actual fact, the plant lost this money. We were 
unable to sell the part of the print run that came to us, 
arriving too late. I was told in the publishing house's accounts 
department: `You cannot imagine even how you were 
cheated....'" 
  It may be observed that the Siberian plant business was an 
isolated instance. But the paper knows of several other episodes 
of the less than ethical attitude of Mr. Mironov toward his 
authors and clients and his financial records. Describing them 
would take too long, showing the records is difficult. But are 
there witnesses? In two years Russkaya Kniga has had three chief 
accountants and as many commercial directors. Not one, according 
to people in the know, surrendered his files on leaving. And 
each of them will remember Mr. Mironov's methods of conducting 
business for a long time, if not forever. 
  We were told in the publishing house: "We still freeze with 
fear merely at the mention of his name...." 
  The appointment of PRAVDA man Mironov to the position of 
chairman of the Committee of the Russian Federation for the 
Press has been seen by many journalists as evidence of an 
obvious cooling on the part of the official authorities toward 
the news media. But, we are convinced, a less atypical person 
than Boris Sergeyevich Mironov also could have coped with the 
organization of the dubious game going by the name of 
"straighten out the journalist." It is obvious, for that matter, 
that the appointment of Mr. Mironov is the result of the 
materialization of quite narrow group interests. Boris 
Sergeyevich is in his position very convenient for a whole 
number of quite influential politicians. He will never, for 
example, fall out with the Committee for Information and 
Communications of the State Duma. And he will hardly abolish the 
at least 15 small state-owned (?) enterprises established on the 
basis of practically all the economic subdivisions of the 
Ministry of Press and Information and the Federal Information 
Center, whose successor the committee is (the newspaper has a 
list of all these small state-owned enterprises). 
  It is perfectly obvious that fighting the very institution 
of 
group (large or small, it is immaterial) political intrigue in 
our society is just as useless as trying to influence the 
weather by means of a collective campaign. Nonetheless, many of 
us formerly paid quite dearly for our democratic toys and 
trinkets for us now to be parting with them overnight. We 
realize, for that matter, that we have taken up too much paper 
and too much of the reader's time with individual traits and 
singularities of the new custodian of the press. The problem is 
not, of course, the character of Mr. Mironov--he does not, 
ultimately, eat children. The problem is that politicians of his 
ilk are again needed and are once again being brought into 
power. Meanwhile, time is passing. Journalists, like the 
peasants and miners, are sitting and waiting for government 
subsidies. The distribution of subsidies is the first and most 
telling manifestation of power. Today power is being manifested 
by the chairman of the Committee of the Russian Federation for 
the Press. We will see who gets the money.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Novomlinskaya: "Russian Cities Want More </F>
Independence"] 
  [Text] Economic changes have hardly yet affected the 
interrelationship between federal and local budgets. Handing 
over the major portion of their tax revenues to the federal 
budget, cities are virtually in no condition right now to carry 
out investment activity or implement social programs. A four-day 
seminar on the topic "Problems of Investment-Construction Policy 
in Russia," organized by the Union of Russian Cities and 
dedicated to a discussion of this problem, completed its 
activity yesterday. 
  The seminar was attended by an array of the most diverse 
organizations. In addition to representatives of the structures 
of power--the presidential staff, Ministry of Finance, Ministry 
of Economics, State Committee on Construction, and Moscow 
Committee on Land--Russian and foreign scholars were also 
invited, as were the commercial organizations SAVVA R.E., RAIN 
[not further identified], and Housing Initiative. The 
representatives of 20 major cities of Russia tried to generalize 
the information provided by those who spoke and present the real 
state of affairs in the investment-construction complex 
throughout Russia as a whole and in the localities as well. 
  The results turned out to be disappointing. It was clear 
from 
the presentations of representatives of the federal authority 
that the municipalities can rely only on themselves in resolving 
the housing problem. The government is presently able to finance 
only the program for provision of housing to military servicemen 
and (partially) to inhabitants of the North who have resettled 
in the central regions. Nor can local authorities rely on 
assistance from commercial structures in the financing of 
housing construction, although the experience of many firms 
using a contributory-construction arrangement tapping funds of 
the populace may find application in the regions. 
  In the opinion of representatives of the municipalities, the 
relationship between powers of the central and local levels of 
authority must be changed. The government has stopped financing 
regional programs but has not reduced its control over the 
activity of city authorities. As a result, the municipalities 
are left one on one with their problems, left with a mass of 
directives and statutes regulating their activities. In 
addition, effective this year a significantly greater share of 
tax revenues is going to the federal budget. Seminar 
participants believe the only way out is to diminish control by 
the center and expand the powers of local organs of authority in 
the use of tax revenues. 
  Results of the seminar will be generalized and reported in 
the conclusion of a group of experts, which will be provided to 
the committees on matters of local self-government under the 
federal legislative and executive authorities. These committees 
are presently drawing up proposals aimed at amending legislation 
on local self-government.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Aleksandr Tumanov, chief of </F>
the Federal Administration for Special Construction under the 
Government of the Russian Federation, by Ivan Ivanyuk; place and 
date not given: "We Are in the Places Where It Is Most Important 
To Be"] 
  [Text] Among the first to complete their part of the work 
for reconstruction of the White House in Moscow after the 
October events were the military construction workers. Besides 
restoring seven floors on the right side of the building, the 
so-called sectors G-1 and G-2, they did a good deal of 
additional work. This organization, which is not well known even 
to specialists, began to be discussed literally during the first 
weeks of work, and when the plans for construction of the new 
parliamentary center appeared, it was the one to receive the 
prestigious order. 
  What kind of a firm is this, which has constructed hundreds 
of the largest facilities but until recently seemed to remain in 
the shadows? This and other questions are answered by Colonel 
General Aleksandr Tumanov, chief of the Federal Administration 
of Special Construction under the Government of the Russian 
Federation. 
  [Ivanyuk] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, last year your organization 
celebrated its 40th anniversary... 
  [Tumanov] Yes, it was created in July 1953. The 
Glavspetsstroy [Main Administration for Special Construction 
Work] (that is what it was called at the time) included 14 
construction and installation administrations, 10 individual 
construction units, and several enterprises with various 
profiles. These forces had to carry out an extremely important 
task--to create an air defense system for Moscow in the shortest 
possible period of time. In addition to specialized facilities 
it was necessary to build a broad highway network, electric 
power transmission lines, substations, mechanization and 
transportation bases, and many other things. As early as 1955 
the basic facilities of the Moscow air defense system were 
turned over to the military department. A system for protection 
of Leningrad was created in parallel. 
  [Ivanyuk] That is, your organization more or less came to 
the 
aid of the military builders of the Ministry of Defense. 
  [Tumanov] Not quite. We found our own "niche" very quickly. 
At the time one of the priority tasks was to raise the country's 
defense industry to a qualitatively new level. Glavspetsstroy 
was assigned the construction of the production shops, 
buildings, and structures, scientific research institutions, and 
design bureaus of the ministries of aviation, the 
radio-technical industry, shipbuilding, and the chemical, 
electronics, and defense industry. New military construction 
administrations were created in Saratov, Kuybyshev, Voronezh, 
Severodvinsk, and other cities. 
  [Ivanyuk] Now one could probably name certain specific 
facilities that were constructed during those years. 
  [Tumanov] It would be impossible to list all that was 
constructed. A very large volume of work was done in Moscow by 
seven military construction administrations. It would probably 
be hard to find a person in the capital who has not heard of the 
firms of Koroleva and Lavochkina or the plants Khromatron and 
imeni Khrunichev. Many administrative buildings, residential 
buildings, and medical institutions were built according to 
individual plans. The remarkable bicycle race track was built on 
Krylatskiy for the 1980 Olympics. 
  In St. Petersburg I would mention first of all the Svetlana 
Plant, the scientific research production-design institute 
Terminal, the Leninets scientific production association, and 
the scientific research institute of instruments, for whose 
construction at the end of the seventies the prize of the USSR 
Council of Ministers was awarded. A significant scientific and 
production potential was created in Voronezh. Among the 
enterprises and scientific research institutes built by the 
military builders was the plant for electro-vacuum instruments, 
the scientific research institute of communications, and the 
design bureau for chemical automation. 
  The Glavspetsstroy has done a great deal for the aerospace 
industry. We built the Center for Aviation and Space 
Machine-Building in Samara where, in particular, the Energiya 
missile was made. And in general for the Energiya-Buran program 
we built facilities in Moscow and in the Urals and in the Moscow 
environs. 
  In Sverdlovsk Oblast such strategically important facilities 
as the plant for producing titanium was introduced, and in 
Verkhnyaya and Nizhnyaya Salda--facilities for testing missile 
aircraft engines. The construction administration in 
Severodvinsk, which is now headed by Major General Anatoliy 
Polyakov, created the Center for Construction of Nuclear 
Submarines starting from zero. The immense scale of this 
construction project is shown by the fact that four football 
fields could be placed under the roof of the assembly shop. 
  During 1966-1967 construction was started on a whole complex 
of defense industry enterprises in Udmurtia. Through the efforts 
of two construction administrations an immense volume of work 
was performed--comparable to what was done in Moscow. Giants of 
industry were constructed such as the Izhevsk automotive plant, 
which is intended for annual output of 200,000 motor vehicles 
and 450,000 motorcycles, the Izhevsk metallurgical combine, 
which provides "defense" with especially strong grades of steel, 
the Izhevsk motor plant, which produces space electronic 
equipment, the Izhevsk radio plant, which produces the most 
complicated instruments and household radio equipment, the now 
world-renowned Votkinskiy machine-building plant where SS-20 
missiles were produced... 
  [Ivanyuk] Each of these facilities probably required that 
the 
builders come up with difficult engineering solutions. 
  [Tumanov] Undoubtedly. For example, when constructing the 
bicycle race track on Krylatskiy in order to cover spans of 168 
meters, they installed on inclined metal arches two 
saddle-shaped coverings made of rolled welded steel sheets four 
millimeters thick. And the supports were reinforced with solid 
reinforced concrete tie-beams which can hold up to 6,000 tonnes. 
This was the first time such a solution had been used in 
domestic or foreign practice. One could give many examples like 
this. And in 1989 the Planning Design-Technological Institute 
was created as a part of Glavspetsstroy, which made it possible 
to perform the full cycle of work for creating one facility or 
another, to introduce the achievements of science and technology 
more actively, and to reduce the time periods for construction. 
  [Ivanyuk] Spetsstroy must be distinguished by its autonomy. 
  [Tumanov] It does approximately 80 percent of its work with 
its own forces. The Main Administration includes automotive 
transportation enterprises and mechanization administrations. 
Practically every year we build an enterprise for the 
development of our own production base. Now, for example, in the 
Moscow suburb of Tuchkovo we are building a modern brick plant 
which meets European standards. It will produce 45 million 
bricks a year. We want to arrange production of plastic 
carpentry items. In recent years we have mastered the technology 
for pouring solid concrete and producing gypsum-cardboard 
partitions. Industry of the Main Administration produces a total 
of more than a million cubic meters of reinforced concrete a 
year, approximately the same amount of gravel and sand, hundreds 
of square meters of carpentry items, tens of thousands of 
"cubes" of items made of cellular concrete, and tens of 
thousands of tonnes of metal structural elements. 
  [Ivanyuk] Your organization has been working for "defense" 
for decades. The conversion of the defense industry, and 
especially the way it is proceeding, could not but affect the 
work of the builders. 
  [Tumanov] Of course, it has had an effect. We too are now 
conducting a kind of conversion process, and it is rather 
painful. While before 1990 each day we released 700,000-750,000 
square meters of industrial space and 500,000-600,000 square 
meters of dwelling space for operation, now it would be ideal to 
reverse this ratio. But the decline of production during the 
past two or three years was so sharp that last year we were only 
able to reach the level of 450,000 square meters. And I am not 
even talking about industrial projects. 
  And this also entailed a considerable outflow of personnel, 
although we were able to retain many of them. The number of 
military construction workers also decreased from 50,000 to 
20,000. Working in Glavspetsstroy has always been prestigious. 
For example, we used to hire 40 graduates of the Moscow 
Engineering Construction School each year and we held a 
competition for them to enter our system. Many officers from the 
military schools also had hopes of working in Glavspetsstroy. I 
recall my own experience, since I came to one of the largest 
construction projects in Udmurtia as a lieutenant after 
graduating from the Kazan Engineering-Construction School. 
  We have always tried to create good conditions for the work 
and recreation of our people: We set up polyclinics and 
hospitals with the latest in technical equipment, built 
sanatoriums-preventive treatment facilities, and health bases. 
Each year 10,000-11,000 children spend the summer in recreation 
camps alone. Even now during these difficult times we are 
building a children's health facility to accommodate 450, which 
is to be put into operation in 1995. We are solving our workers' 
housing problems. There were times when we constructed 
200,000-250,000 square meters of housing a year for ourselves 
alone. But even this year, for example, in Moscow alone we will 
release at least 250 apartments. 
  Now we are faced with the task of making housing 
construction 
the main area of the work of the entire Main Administration. To 
do this we are reconstructing housing construction combines in 
Izhevsk and Novorossiysk. 
  [Ivanyuk] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, what are your specific 
plans 
for this year? 
  [Tumanov] There are many suggestions. A large volume of work 
is planned for Moscow. Thus the Moscow Construction Committee 
has turned over to us for reconstruction an entire block of 
residences on Zoologicheskaya Street--about 100,000 square 
meters of housing, garages, parking lots, and offices. In 
today's prices this amounts to more than a quarter of a trillion 
rubles. Large amounts of work are also planned for Butovo and 
Lyublina. 
  If we look at the defense industry, it is "loading" us by 15 
percent. They are the traditional clients--the Izhevsk plants, 
the design bureau imeni Lavochkin, the Severodvinsk nuclear 
center. Perhaps the most difficult situation now is in 
Severodvinsk: They have plenty of work but no money. We might 
have to relocate part of the organization to another region. Two 
new construction administrations were formed recently in 
Krasnodar Kray and the creation of several subdivisions is in 
the stage of development. We are prepared to work in any region 
of Russia and carry out any tasks in short periods of time. 
  [Ivanyuk] The "special construction workers" are used to 
strict deadlines but will you be able to compete in terms of 
quality? 
  [Tumanov] With good quality of construction materials and 
control of the course of the work I think we can cope with any 
task, and it is a fact that we will do it at a lower cost, even 
if we have to buy some of the materials abroad. We have 
experience in building unique facilities. I have already 
mentioned the bicycle race track on Krylatskaya. I can also name 
others: the Moscow area flight control center, the relay tower 
in Novorossiysk. We are also striving to gain new experience. In 
1990 we acquired a license to engage in foreign economic 
activity and we already have two joint ventures with foreign 
firms functioning. During this time we have managed to build a 
station for technical service for the Soviet-Japanese firm Imis. 
In conjunction with the Canadians we have released several 
offices "turnkey" for foreign firms and we are building an ice 
cream plant for the well-known American firm Baskin-Robbins in 
Moscow. So we are giving serious thought to reaching the level 
of world standards.

<F P=106> [Interview with A.N. Raspopin, chairman of the Novosibirsk </F>
Municipal Committee for Protection of Consumer Rights, by 
Vladimir Krylov, VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK correspondent; place and 
date not given: "The Law Is on Our Side"] 
  [Text] Last year, starting in May, from the moment 
the Law "On Protection of Consumer Rights" went into effect and 
the appropriate municipal committee was established, the 
committee received about 2,000 complaints, more than 1,500 of 
which were examined and the rest are in a stage of resolution. 
More than 37 million rubles [R] has been returned to purchasers. 
We bring to your attention an interview by our correspondent 
with A.N. Raspopin, chairman of the Municipal Committee for 
Protection of Consumer Rights. 
  [Krylov] Aleksey Nikolayevich, I happened to read about this 
kind of incident once in an American journal. Coming down the 
stairs in a hotel, a little girl stumbled on the stair carpet, 
broke the heel of her shoe, and dislocated her foot. A suit was 
filed in court. Expert analysis established that, first, the 
runner was not stretched tight and, second, that the screws 
attaching the heel were not long enough and did not ensure 
reliability. The victim was paid a big sum in damage 
compensation. After reading this, you will sigh: Well, that is 
in their country! You will not get anything like this in our 
country. Is this really so, is our consumer without rights? 
  [Raspopin] No, not now. Each one of us is reliably protected 
by the Law "On Consumer Protection." In addition, it is well 
reinforced by the Statute "On Coordinated Actions To Ensure 
State Protection of the Rights of Consumers of Commodities, 
Work, and Services," which was signed by a whole number of 
responsible government organs. An entire system for the 
protection of consumer rights has been established in the 
country. 
  [Krylov] Everything is described in sufficient detail and 
clearly in the law. But what are the fundamental rights of an 
individual if he bought a commodity of poor quality, or if he is 
dissatisfied with work and services performed on his order? 
  [Raspopin] In the event that an article proves to be of low 
quality, has defects and flaws, and does not meet required 
standards, the seller is obliged to perform repairs at his own 
expense or replace the commodity. If the article went out of 
commission during the warranty period, responsibility is also 
placed with the selling organization and, in addition, if the 
purchaser refuses an exchange, he is reimbursed not the former 
cost but the new cost in effect the day of the appeal. We have 
mainly had complaints about television sets, refrigerators, and 
washing machines, and they occurred for wine and vodka items and 
household services. All the suits were satisfied. I will cite 
even this example. As a result of a power surge, expensive 
equipment--a personal computer system and a video set--were 
burned out at citizen Stankov's place. He filed a suit. The case 
was decided in his favor, and the cost of the equipment--R1.7 
million--was paid, plus punitive damages, and 15 percent of the 
cost to the state budget; in addition, the guilty organization 
paid R36,000 for the expert evaluation. 
  [Krylov] But how is trade reacting? 
  [Raspopin] Sometimes it shows opposition and refuses to 
compensate for damage voluntarily: returning the money, or 
replacing the commodity. But as soon as the question of bringing 
the case to court arises, the tone of many people changes, as a 
rule. 
  [Krylov] It also happens frequently that sellers cannot 
provide reliable information about the commodity and the 
manufacturing firm. Either they do not possess it, or they 
cannot be bothered to answer, or they deliberately conceal 
things in order to sell a commodity. What is done in such a case? 
  [Raspopin] Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the Law "On Protection of 
Consumer Rights" obliges the manufacturer and seller to make 
information about a commodity available to the purchaser in an 
easily understood form--the manufacturer, the price, the main 
consumer features, and storage periods. Incidentally, on the 
basis of the Law "On Answerability of Sellers for Violating 
Consumer Rights" in the event of a systematic violation of 
rights, a trade enterprise and a manufacturing firm can be 
liquidated in the established legislative procedure. It cannot 
be ruled out that an announcement could be made about the fact 
that the store is being closed for violating consumer rights. 
  [Krylov] There is not always time in the store to examine a 
purchase. For example, I brought it home, looked it over 
carefully, there was something I did not like, then... 
  [Raspopin] Then the purchaser has the right within two weeks 
from the day of the sale to return the commodity and demand an 
exchange. 
  [Krylov] The rather widespread rebuke still occurs in trade: 
We did not produce it, all claims have to be made with the 
manufacturing plant. 
  [Raspopin] This is absolutely not true. Trade is obliged to 
sell only quality commodities, to conclude a contract for 
guaranteed service and repair, or to refuse to sell such a 
commodity. Even if there is no contract but the commodity is 
defective, trade is nonetheless obliged to repair or replace it, 
and it in turn requires compensation from the manufacturer. 
  [Krylov] But what about warranty periods? Household 
equipment 
is expensive, but trade frequently establishes ridiculous 
periods--sometimes several days, sometime a couple of weeks, 
and, at best, a month. But a hidden defect does not always 
appear that quickly. 
  [Raspopin] Here trade is wrong. Established standard periods 
exist--for complicated household equipment, as a rule, this is a 
year or two. Even if the seller writes that, he says, he is 
giving a guarantee for only two weeks or two months, in the 
event the purchased household equipment breaks down the law will 
be on the side of the consumer. 
  [Krylov] That is, sellers should remember the saying: You 
cannot back out once you have begun. 
  [Raspopin] Absolutely correct. And also a certificate has to 
be shown during the purchase. All products that come into the 
trade network must be certified in a mandatory procedure. 
Incidentally, if the trade inspection discovers the absence of a 
certificate--it has a right to remove the commodity from sale. 
  [Krylov] Sometimes in the plant instructions for equipment, 
notations are made that if there is no date of sale and store 
stamp or the commodity was sold by a commercial structure, the 
manufacturer is not responsible and does not provide warranty 
repair. 
  [Raspopin] The purchaser does not have to pay attention to 
such notations, just as the court does not take them into 
account. Such notations contradict the Law "On Protection of 
Consumer Rights." 
  [Krylov] Thus, if the purchaser acquired a faulty commodity, 
and trade refuses to satisfy his claim, he should appeal to you? 
  [Raspopin] Yes, but only physical, private persons. We do 
not 
examine suits of juridical persons. We will provide the consumer 
with a consultation, and we will draw up all documents free of 
charge, and the purchaser himself will not have to pester anyone. 
  [Krylov] As far as I know, the procedure for appealing to 
the 
court is rather simple. But why do people, after gossiping among 
themselves, not defend their rights according to the law? 
  [Raspopin] Most likely because the very word "court" is 
associated with something unpleasant. But after all, this is a 
normal civilized means of defense of their rights. Indeed, even 
the plaintiff may not appear in court himself--our structure 
will take care of everything for him.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Loktev: "They Are Not Striking Against </F>
The Good Life"] 
  [Text] Strike. This alarming and threatening word burst 
into our lives during the summer of 1989. It was at this time 
that the Kuznets Basin miners, driven to despair, revealed to 
the dissatisfied authorities the true meaning of the term worker 
solidarity. 
  Over the past five years, millions of workers in dozens of 
branches participated in strikes as an extreme measure of 
protest in the struggle for their rights. They gradually became 
a common social phenomenon throughout the expanses of Russia and 
the CIS, a phenomenon which, unfortunately, is increasing in 
scale. 
  An unprecedented "strike flare-up" was recorded by the 
Russian Federation Goskomstat [State Statistical Committee] 
during the first quarter of this year: these strikes involved 
288 enterprises, or 24 more than during all of 1993. 
  The statistical table included herein enables a reader to 
determine for himself the degree to which strike activity has 
increased (data for the first quarter of 1993 and 1994). 


                  Number of             Number of              Losses in 
                  enterprises that      participants,          working time, 
                  participated in       thousands of people,   thousands of 
                  strikes, 1993, 1994   1993, 1994             man-days, 1993, 
                                                               1994 

Overall           29         288        18.2       114.5      34.2     283.1 

Industry          28         137        17.9       87.4       33.2     168.6 

Including: 

Fuel              27         135        17.5       87.0       30.3     167.1 

Education         -          137        -          24.7       -        107.2 

Construction      -          7          -          1.3        -        4.7 

Transport and     1          4          0.3        0.7        1.0      2.0 
Communications 

Other branches    -          3          -          0.4        -        0.6 


  There is no need for commenting upon these figures, since 
they speak for themselves. Compared to the first quarter of last 
year, the number of strikes increased by a factor of 10.3! 
  According to data provided by Mintrud [Ministry of Labor], 
the indicators for labor conflicts and disputes are even more 
striking. Since the beginning of the year, they have been 
recorded at 1,356 enterprises, organizations and institutions 
throughout Russia. 
  As for losses, so far this year, as a result of strikes (not 
counting enterprise idle time caused by other factors), the 
output of the fuel-energy complex declined by 8.8 billion 
rubles' worth of product. As a result of deliberate cessation of 
operations, 88 enterprises failed to deliver more than 3.5 
billion rubles' worth of contracted goods. The greatest losses 
from strikes occurred in the Komi Republic, western Siberia and 
in Kemerovo, Tula and Tostov oblasts. 
  The principal causes of these strikes and labor conflicts 
are 
well known: decline in production volumes, financial crisis, 
non-payments in mutual accounts, and particularly -- 
considerable indebtedness of the federal budget and numerous 
delays in wage payments for workers in the "basic" branches. 
  According to data furnished by the General Trade Union 
Conference, the overall wage indebtedness for the CIS on the 
whole, for the month of March, amounted to approximately three 
trillion rubles. In Russia alone, the workers at 35,000 
enterprises failed to receive the money for their labor in a 
timely manner. 
  It must be assumed that, following numerous meetings between 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and representatives of striking 
organizations, the government is striving if not to eliminate 
entirely then at least slow down those processes which promote 
strikes. It was by no means an accident that, on 11 February, 
Viktor Stepanovich, during a meeting with miners, stated 
directly: wage indebtedness will be eliminated gradually (and 
this is being accomplished -- V.L.). And he added: "The question 
of whether or not to strike does not disturb me. The problem 
lies in the fact that we are unable to handle correctly that 
which is at our disposal." It is hoped that this time the 
government will keep its word and strive to suppress the wave of 
strikes using economic measures. Nevertheless, it is my opinion 
that the severity of the strike movement (with varying degrees 
of activity depending upon the branch involved) will continue in 
the immediate future. This is so, owing to the fact that the 
problems being resolved will be replaced by other equally 
alarming problems. 
  For example, one such problem among miners is the threat of 
unemployment: the closing down of exhausted and unprofitable 
mines, with no new jobs being created. Moreover, work is simply 
dangerous at a number of mines: the equipment is worn out to an 
extreme and the prices for new items of equipment are ruinous. 
Funds are simply not available for maintaining the mines in safe 
operating condition. Hence we are encountering one tragedy after 
another involving human victims. 
  Yes, miners are perishing owing to intolerable working 
conditions and neglect of the basic safety requirements. In 
Moscow Oblast alone, 48 individuals perished at their working 
positions over a period of three months -- considerably more 
than the figure for last year. 
  Not only the government, but also all authoritative 
structures in Russia should recall one basic truth: a strike is 
not waged against the good life. The main question is how life 
can be changed for the better in a more rapid, effective and 
realistic manner.

<F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Solovyev, secretary FITUR: "Minimum Wage </F>
--40,000 Rubles"] 
  [Text] Fitur insists upon a minimum wage of 40,000 rubles 
and the trade unions approached Chernomyrdin a third time in 
this regard. 
  As is known, the last indexation of the minimum wage amount 
(minimum wage) was carried out on 1 December 1993, at which time 
it amounted to 14,620 rubles. We are coming to the end of the 
sixth month and everything is just as in the past. It is as 
though the cost of living is not rising. Officials of Minfin 
[Ministry of Finance] officially stated, in behalf of the 
government, that the minimum will best be reviewed during the 
third quarter, when it will reach the level of the present 
minimum pension. Thus, just as in the past, the authorities will 
solve the budget problems by means of hired workers. 
  In this regard, it is worth citing several state statistical 
figures. The average monthly wage during the first quarter of 
1994 was 146,000 rubles and compared to the same period for last 
year this represented an increase by a factor of 7.5, with 
prices increasing by more than a factor of eight. 
  In December, the difference between the minimum wage and the 
average national economic wage amounted to a factor of 9.5 and 
in March -- 11. And the lag in the minimum wage compared to the 
minimum living wage, during the same period, was 3.3 in December 
and 4.8 in March respectively. 
  It is regrettable that low income workers are the group most 
affected by the freezing of the minimum wage. 
  In this regard, FITUR was recently forced to turn to Premier 
V. Chernomyrdin a third time, since the previous appeals (in 
March and April) on indexation of the minimum wage were declined 
by the Ministry of Finance. The arguments put forth by the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Finance regarding reindexation 
were in our opinion invalid: the proportion of the minimum wage 
in the minimum living wage of an able-bodied citizen declined in 
December 1993, compared to January of the same year, from 34.8 
percent to 30.3, and continues to decline. 
  FITUR views the existing situation as a direct violation of 
the Russian Federation law entitled "Minimum Wage Amount" and 
also as non-fulfillment of the general agreement between the 
all-Russian associations of trade unions, the all-Russian 
associations of employers and the government of the Russian 
Federation for 1994, in the section dealing with the "maximum 
possible approach of the minimum wage amount to the actual value 
for the minimum living wage." This increases social tension in 
society and lowers the level of confidence in the government. 
  In behalf of member organizations, FITUR has proposed that 
the government declare its readiness to monitor the signed 
agreement regarding social accord and the general agreement for 
1994 and to resolve the question regarding the establishment, 
commencing 1 May 1994, of a minimum wage in the amount of 40,000 
rubles and a wage rate of the first category ETS [Unified Wage 
Rate] in the amount of 42,000 rubles.

<F P=106> [Article by G. Kostin, chairman of the PRP NVAER Trade Union </F>
Committee: "If No Money Is Paid For Work, Then For Whom Are 
These Reforms Intended?"] 
  [Text] Dear Editorial Board of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA! Our 
appeal addressed to the president and government of the Russian 
Federation and the response thereto were published in your 
newspaper on 22 February and 22 March 1994. The course of events 
forces us to once again speak out in this newspaper and quite 
possibly not for the last time. Only the president of the 
"Rosenergoatom" Concern commented upon our appeal in the 
newspaper. The remaining elements remained silent. 
  Truly, we were provided with "systematic assistance" in the 
form of a one-time credit in the amount of 30 million rubles, an 
amount which constituted one fifth of the monthly wage fund. 
This assistance was to be returned within a period of three 
months. 
  Thus, there have been no changes for the better since the 
appeal was published on 22 February 1994. To the contrary, the 
situation has deteriorated and social tension has increased -- 
indeed, the last salary received by the collective was for 
November 1993. At the same time, lacking the funds for paying 
wages and thus not issuing them, the enterprise is obligated to 
transfer income tax (from wages not received) and to make 
assignments to the pension and other funds, with extra charges 
for late payments. 
  Are we really speaking in a language not understood by the 
officials? We are not asking for nitpicking interference or for 
charity and we are not praying to the Almighty. No, we are 
asking the chief debtor, namely the state, to ensure 
reimbursement for the obligation in the form of dearly earned 
money. 
  As a mark of protest against that which took place 
illegally, 
we participated in sanctioned picketing of the White House. 
There has been no response to our appeal and workers attached to 
the "Novovoronezhatomenergoremont" Production Repair Enterprise, 
for the fifth month now, since December 1993, have not received 
their wages and have been subsisting on bread and potatoes. 
  Gentlemen, rulers! Your discussions regarding improvements 
in 
the people's standard of living and lowering inflation 
(inflation has declined, since half of Russia is not receiving 
wages) -- are nothing more than fantasies being substituted for 
reality. Thanks to your "talented" leadership, the approved 
program for the market is failing before our very eyes. The 
destruction of atomic power engineering, now in progress, is 
tantamount to the destruction of Russia. 
  Gentlemen! Devote more thought to this matter.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Voronin, chief of the Organization of </F>
Pension Services Administration of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Social Protection, by ROSSIYA correspondent Svetlana 
Bakulina: "Intrigues and Pensions"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Ministry of Social 
Protection has worked out a concept for pension reform. This 
concept, which has already been approved by a number of 
ministries, is the prototype for a draft law on pensions. Yuriy 
Voronin, chief of the Organization of Pension Services 
Administration of the Ministry of Social Protection, answers 
some questions by a ROSSIYA correspondent. 
  [Bakulina] How are the roles assigned among the services in 
charge of pensions? 
  [Voronin] The Ministry of Social Protection and this 
ministry's system organize the work of assigning and paying the 
pensions. The Pension Fund is a special financial organization 
whose purpose is to collect the pension taxes from enterprises 
and finance the payment of pensions in accordance with 
applications from the social protection organs. In addition, 
communications enterprises and the Savings Bank, which deliver 
pensions directly to the recipients, operate in our network as 
well. 
  [Bakulina] Previously, everyone knew only what the sobes 
[Social Security] said, and everything was understood. Now the 
Pension Fund, which does not have any money, for some reason, 
has made its appearance... 
  [Voronin] The idea belonged to the union's ministries of 
labor and finance. It was Vladimir Shcherbakov, who was chairman 
of the USSR Goskomtrud [State Committee for Labor and Social 
Problems] at the time, and later vice premier in the last union 
government. And Valentin Pavlov, the minister of finance. They 
maintained: if we take the pension money out of the state budget 
(the overall budget) and transfer it to an independent budget, 
pensions will not be financed in accordance with the residual 
principle, as before, but the principles of self-sufficiency. 
  [[Bakulina] That is, the pension money should grow as if it 
were in yeast? 
  [Voronin] It was a very clever maneuver when a tax increase 
was disguised under social needs. Because the insurance rate 
under the previous social security system did not exceed 7 
percent from enterprises' wage fund. When they passed the USSR 
pension law, they calculated that 26 percent of the wage fund 
would be required to implement it. But they set the insurance 
rate at the figure 37 under the Pension Fund. When they formed 
the Pension Fund, the decision was made that 11 percent of this 
37 percent would be put into an economic stabilization fund. 
This was done in accordance with Gorbachev's directive. I do not 
think anyone except Pavlov knows what kind of a fund this is and 
where he spent the money. 
  [Bakulina] But how did this manage to get through the 
Supreme 
Soviet? 
  [Voronin] But who will raise his hand to vote against the 
pensioners? When they began preparing the Russian pension law, 
they did it mainly to spite the union's law, saying that 
everything was bad under the Soviet Union, but everything will 
be fine in Russia. They imitated everything related to the 
Pension Fund, however. Even that 37 percent. Though in the 
Soviet Union the Pension Fund was subordinate to the government, 
it was considered at the time that the best people were 
assembled in the Supreme Soviet, so they made the Pension Fund 
subordinate to the Supreme Soviet. At first it did well: 37 
percent for pensions was too much, all the same. It was possible 
to put money aside and invest it. Later on the interest rate 
dropped to 28. And the problems began. Both because of this and 
our worsening economic situation in general. In addition, the 
Pension Fund was used by the former Supreme Soviet in its 
struggle with the executive authority. The Supreme Soviet made 
decisions that were deliberately populist, but it presented them 
as concern for the pensioners. These decisions were not backed 
up by anything financially, although the Pension Fund promised: 
we will finance everything. But things came apart later on. The 
Pension Fund promised indexing and an increase in pensions, 
planning that wages would also increase. But the Supreme Soviet 
was concerned with pensions and the government was concerned 
with wages. Wages rose more slowly than the pensions. Which 
should not be the case, in principle. A pension cannot be larger 
than wages. 
  [Bakulina] Then what do you say about the nonstate pension 
funds that are being developed? 
  [Voronin] There is no future for them in the form they are 
being established today. Foreign experience shows that funds 
such as these can be developed when an enterprise either 
contributes all the money for its employees or when 
contributions from the enterprise and its employees are added 
together. Counting exclusively on employee contributions, as we 
are starting to do today, is not a serious approach. The overall 
insurance rate for all types of insurance is roughly 40 percent. 
Add the taxes to this, and it will be a huge sum. Enterprises 
have no incentive to transfer such an amount of money to 
nonstate pension funds--they have to deal with the state taxes, 
for God's sake. As far as working citizens are concerned, who 
will risk putting something away for some unknown purpose? 
  [Bakulina] Aren't they really given any guarantees? 
  [Voronin] The risk is very high. For example, I formed my 
own 
fund, I invested money in the KamAZ [Kama Automotive Plant], and 
I want to receive dividends. But the KamAZ went bankrupt. So my 
fund went bankrupt as well, 
  [Bakulina] Are you prepared to protect citizens in the event 
that there are any excesses in these funds? 
  [Voronin] They have not come to us with any complaints yet. 
But they may come. They went to Chubays with complaints about 
"Tekhnicheskiy Progress," although the checking fund had no 
investment license. Chubays is not responsible for it, but he 
had to get involved. The same thing may happen to us. And 
although I am not formally responsible for the funds' activity, 
I will obviously have to become familiar with the details. We 
have formed a small subunit of three individuals to compile a 
register of the funds. 
  [Bakulina] What is the nature of the reform being proposed 
by 
your department? 
  [Voronin] We are proposing the formation of a normal pension 
insurance system, in which a unified pension insurance 
institution collects the insurance contributions, finances the 
pensions, and assigns and pays them. The institution may be 
established only after a record of individualized insurance 
payments is introduced. It should contain all the information: 
the amount each citizen has deducted for the pension fund, how 
much time he has been deducting, and what his earnings were. 
Then we will not need labor books or earnings statements, 
because everything will be in the data bank. This cannot be 
quickly implemented technically. For this reason, we consider 
creation of a mechanism to protect pensioners from the 
unfavorable consequences of the shift to the market to be our 
priority task. Legislation has not responded to these processes, 
unfortunately, so a new market pension law is needed. 
  [Bakulina] Will the parliament pass new legislation? 
  [Voronin] A great deal depends on organization of the work. 
In Germany, as an example, they passed a law aimed at the year 
2015. All the political parties--the ruling and opposition 
parties--met and worked out the norms suitable to everyone. I 
think we should organize our work this way--we should sit down 
in parliament and together with the members of parliament, go 
through each article in the new draft law. 
  [Bakulina] Let us assume that the deputies discuss the 
problem of working pensioners. What have you prepared in this 
regard? 
  [Voronin] When the union's law of 1956--which lasted for 30 
years--was introduced, there was no provision in it on the 
possibility of receiving a pension during a working period. A 
precedent was set when Kosygin visited one of the defense 
plants. Uncle Vasya, a fitter who was unique in his field, had 
been pensioned and there was no one else to make certain parts. 
Then Kosygin proposed that an exception be made in his case, 
enabling him to receive his pension and wages at the same time. 
Then there was a second, then a third case... The list of 
situations in which a pension was being paid gradually became 
larger, as is usually the case. 
  [Bakulina] Only the intelligentsia has been "unworthy" of 
such a privilege. 
  [Voronin] Indeed. I do not think that a return to the 
previous situation, in order to do away with a pension during a 
period of work, will be successful, and there is no need to do 
this, of course. But we obviously do not have to index the 
pension of those who are working. But after all, what do we end 
up with? A working pensioner is indexed twice--for his pension 
and for his wages. Secondly, taking into account that there is 
not enough money in the Pension Fund, there should be a certain 
limitation on pensions in accordance with the principle which 
applied previously for servicemen, when a person's pension plus 
his wages should not exceed his earnings when he began his 
pension. This is very widespread in the West, by the way. 
  [Bakulina] Try to explain this in an example. 
  [Voronin] Very simple. If you were working and your pension 
was figured from earnings of 100,000 rubles [R], you were 
assigned a pension of R60,000 or R70,000. You can continue to 
work and receive any wage, but you will be paid your pension in 
such a way that your earnings, plus your pension, do not exceed 
your R100,000. This is one of the versions. Perhaps they will 
select a different one. Only bear one simple fact in mind: when 
there is no money left in the Pension Fund, a decision on some 
restrictive measures--either on payment, or age, or some other 
factor--must be be made without fail. And we will be making the 
decision under conditions that are worse. And that decision will 
be more painful for society than the current one--a gradual and 
prepared decision.

<F P=106> [Article by KOMMERSANT correspondents Sergey Topol, Dmitriy </F>
Pavlov, and Igor Fedorov under the rubric "Terrorist Acts in 
Moscow": "Criminals Blow Up Armenian Family's Apartment"] 
  [Text] Two powerful explosions went off in Moscow 
last Saturday. The bombs had been placed in residential 
buildings on Leo Tolstoy and Zelenodolskaya Streets. As a result 
one person is dead, and six are seriously wounded. The 
terrorists were not apprehended right away. KOMMERSANT 
correspondents Sergey Topol, Dmitriy Pavlov, and Igor Fedorov 
visited the sites of the incidents. 
  At 0800 on 16 April residents of the apartment house on 7 
Lev 
Tolstoy Street (formerly the property of the USSR Council of 
Ministers) were awakened by a powerful explosion that went off 
on the second floor stair landing of entrance No. 3. The shock 
wave knocked out the doors of several apartments, shattered 
windows from the first to the fifth floor, and damaged the 
elevator. According to militia personnel who arrived at the 
incident site, the explosion tore off the arm of Valeriy 
Chernikov who happened to be near apartment No. 118. In 
addition, Maria Chetvertkova, the building's grounds keeper who 
was cleaning the stairs, ended up with a head bruise. Chernikov 
and Chetvertkova were taken to a hospital. Also injured was the 
apartment owner's dog--boxer Gretta's fur was singed on its back 
and sides. 
  As KOMMERSANT correspondents were able to establish, the 
explosion took place under the following circumstances. The 
occupants of the apartment were Irina Ulyanova, a housewife, and 
Sergey Ostroukhov, director of Cafe Cherkizovo. Early in the 
morning they had a visitor--their friend Valeriy Chernikov. He 
noticed a suspicious plastic parcel next to the apartment (half 
a year ago, in November, an F-1 grenade was tied up to the door 
handle of the same apartment, but on that occasion the explosion 
was averted). Chernikov attempted to carry the package out to 
the street, but the bomb inside the package went off. Chernikov 
lost his left hand. On the same day the militia searched Cafe 
Cherkizovo, which is currently under repair. They were looking 
for explosive devices, but did not find any. 
  In an interview with KOMMERSANT correspondents, militia 
personnel said that the package contained a homemade explosive 
device. According to them, so far there is no clear hypothesis 
as to the motive for the terrorist act (in the November 
incident, both the apartment owners and the militia assumed that 
the grenade had been tied to the apartment door out of 
"hooliganism"). A criminal case was opened on the subject of the 
explosion, which was transferred to the procuracy for 
investigation. 
  At 2320 the same day a powerful (500 g of TNT) explosive 
device, secured to a first floor window bar, went off at 
building No. 2, 9 Zelenodolskaya Street. The impact of the 
explosion was such that it made a hole more than a meter in 
diameter in the building's bearing wall. In addition, partitions 
between rooms were destroyed, the apartment's entrance door 
knocked out, and windows broken from the first through sixth 
floors. The shock wave lifted a Moskvich car standing about 20 m 
from the point of the explosion and threw it onto a Zhiguli car 
standing nearby. The victims of the explosion were an Armenian 
family that had lived in this apartment for about three years. 
The head of the household, Eduard Kuzikyan, died on the spot; 
his mother, wife, brother, and four-year-old son were seriously 
wounded. The victims' neighbors told a KOMMERSANT correspondent 
that they pulled Mr. Kuzikyan from under the rubble and tried to 
resuscitate him, but to no avail. Militia personnel refrained 
from commentary, citing confidentiality of investigation.

<H5>  KOMMERSANT Experts' Advice on Personal Safety </H5>
  The actions of a person who discovers an unidentified object 
depend first and foremost on whether he has reason to believe 
that this object may contain an explosive device. 
  1. If you do not have reason, but are not certain that the 
object is harmless, you can attempt to evacuate the object you 
have discovered from the zone of potential danger to others. 
Select for this purpose a nearby place not frequented by people. 
Lift the object very carefully and do not press against any part 
of it under any circumstances. If it is a briefcase, carryall, 
or suitcase, never lift it by the handle--it may be connected to 
a detonator. 
  2. If you have reason to believe that you have discovered a 
bomb, it is best not to touch it altogether. Homemade explosive 
devices (HED), which are the kind most often used by criminals, 
are the most dangerous of all types of explosive devices. Even 
professional explosives experts are advised to destroy them on 
the spot. 
  3. A person who discovers a bomb should take immediate steps 
to ensure the safety of others. If a bomb has been found in a 
building stairway, you need to warn the tenants to either leave 
their apartments or stay in them under the cover of bearing 
walls. Remember that the entrance door is poor protection 
against flying fragments and the shock wave. It is preferable to 
open the windows in the apartments and on the staircase--the 
shock wave (in the event of an explosion) will escape to the 
open space without doing too much damage. 
  4. If you are approaching an apartment and see a burning 
cord 
leading to a suspicious object, try to avert an explosion. In 
order to do this, hold the object in place (but do not put 
strong pressure on it, and with the other hand jerk the cord out 
and throw it away. Find cover immediately. Wait for at least 15 
minutes, then leave the cover and do not forget to report the 
incident to the militia (make sure that your report is 
registered). [end box]

<F P=106> [Article by Yekaterina Zapodinskaya: "The Criminal Aimed at </F>
a Businessman, Not a Deputy: Investigation of State Duma 
Deputy's Murder"] 
  [Text] A funeral will be held in Khimki today for 
35-year-old Andrey Aizderdzis, a State Duma deputy and former 
chairman of the board of the International Business Corporation 
(MDK) and MDK-Bank. He was killed on the evening of 26 April 
near the entrance to his apartment building by a shot from a 
pump-action rifle. The investigation is working on many 
possibilities; KOMMERSANT has learned of nine of them. 
<H5>  A Quarrel With the Mayor </H5>
  At the Khimki procuracy, which has opened a criminal case on 
the murder, our KOMMERSANT correspondent was told that the 
investigation is working on all possible versions, first among 
which is the so-called "political" one. It is possible that the 
victim was selected from an alphabetical list of deputies, where 
Aizderdzis is near the top. 
  The second version takes into consideration the enmity 
between the deputy and the mayor of Khimki, of which the entire 
town was aware. According to MDK General Director Aleksey 
Ponomarev, "Andrey Daynisovich did not have any enemies except 
Mayor Yuriy Korablin and his inner circle." One of the causes of 
the conflict had been Mr. Korablin's refusal to issue a 
certificate of ownership for the mansion in Old Khimki which 
houses the International Business Corporation and MDK-Bank. They 
had bought the decrepit structure from the consumer services 
administration, and after reconstruction it became one of the 
most beautiful mansions in town. It turned out later, however, 
that such a deal was illegal, since state property cannot be 
alienated without a bid or an auction. Therefore, at the mayor's 
initiative, it was annulled in the arbitration court. 
  The mutual dislike between the head of the town 
administration and the bank management increased after the 
beating of Sergey Chernykh, director of Khimki cable television, 
who is considered the "mayor's man." On the day of elections to 
the State Duma, bodily injury was inflicted on Mr. Chernykh for 
refusing to air a video film on Andrey Aizderdzis' meetings with 
famous people--Nikolay Ryzhkov and Nikita Mikhalkov. According 
to Mr. Chernykh, he was roughed up by two MDK guards at 
Aizderdzis' order. He was not able to prove this allegation to 
the investigation, however, and the criminal case initiated 
against the State Duma deputy was closed. The management of 
MDK-Bank called the beating "a provocation, and not the first 
one, on the part of the mayor." 
  In the bankers' opinion, it was the mayoralty that had 
initiated the audit of MDK-Bank and the corporation, conducted 
by the city's tax inspectorate and tax police. The bank was told 
to pay into the budget 100 million rubles [R], the 
corporation--R1.2 billion. The bank paid up, but the MDK called 
the inspectors' actions "lawlessness," withdrew the money from 
its account, and de facto ceased to exist. 
  Soon after the audit Andrey Aizderdzis sent a letter to 
Russia's Tax Police Department. In it the banker reported that 
the chief of the Khimki tax police, Dmitriy Karasev, had 
"blackmailed" him, demanding that he voluntarily transfer to the 
budget R250 million and threatening to otherwise slap the MDK 
and the bank with R4 billion in sanctions. This conversation 
with Mr. Karasev was recorded on tape. Aizderdzis also said in 
his letter that in the spring of 1993 MDK handed over to 
Aleksandr Gayderov, deputy head of the city administration, R3 
million to purchase a car for Mr. Karasev, who was also paid 
R100,000-150,000 monthly as a "bonus to supplement his salary." 
In his letter the banker said that he was prepared to "produce 
witnesses" for the Tax Police Department to support this 
information. 
<H5>  Mayoralty Inclined To Believe "Gangster" Version </H5>
  All staff members of the local administration with whom the 
KOMMERSANT correspondent had a chance to talk believe that it is 
to MDK-Bank's benefit to lead the investigation away from the 
true causes of the murder. Which are allegedly to be found in 
its commercial activities, as well as in its former connection 
with the Zelenograd-Khimki organized crime group led by Viktor 
Burlachko (until his arrest for extortion in the summer of 
1992). According to unofficial data, the Burlachko group for 
while served as MDK's "cover," but after the arrest of its 
leader, Andrey Aizderdzis "did not find common language" with 
"Burlak's" successor Dmitriy Romanov. In 1993 the banker 
allegedly even helped to "hand over" to the militia Romanov, who 
was on the wanted list. According to information from the same 
source, the murder was "revenge for Romanov." 
  MDK-Bank Chairman of the Board Anatoliy Vasilyev (a former 
procurator) said that as early as December 1993 two unknown 
persons had threatened him and demanded that he immediately 
resign his position. Aizderdzis could have chosen to dismiss 
Vasilyev, but had not done so because he valued the latter as a 
competent jurist. Then on 25 December, when the banker stepped 
out of his house to shake out a carpet, two burly men who 
"looked like gangsters" approached him. One of them grabbed 
Vasilyev by the ear and said: "You make waves, and even 
bodyguards will not help your kid and your family." 
  The banker turned to the oblast procuracy and told them that 
the threats were directed not so much against him as aimed at 
getting at Aizderdzis. "My prophesy came true," Mr. Vasilyev 
told a KOMMERSANT correspondent a few days ago. According to 
him, what made the tragedy possible was that the investigators 
who were in charge of the criminal case on the subject of the 
threats against him had led the case into a dead end. 
  The version of gangster revenge was refuted by MDK General 
Director Aleksey Ponomarev. According to him, in 1991 Burlachko 
did indeed visit MDK, but currently the corporation would hardly 
be of interest to criminal structures, since it does not have 
"either retail kiosks or cash." 
<H5>  Aizderdzis' Newspaper Insulted Crime Bosses </H5>
  One more version of the investigation is also connected with 
the criminal world. The victim was not only a politician and a 
banker but also a publisher. He published a newspaper of a 
patriotic orientation, "Who Is Who," whose editor in chief was 
well-known literary figure Stanislav Rybas. In this year's 
seventh issue the newspaper published a list of 266 leaders of 
the criminal world, with names (mostly of Caucasian origin), 
nicknames, and a crime record of the crime bosses. Someone on 
this list may "hold a grudge" against the publisher, since these 
"authorities" have a tremendous dislike for having their "lay" 
name linked with their criminal world nicknames. Actually, in 
the militia's opinion, this list is incomplete and imprecise, 
besides which it had already been published in a self-published 
brochure (which, on the other hand, may not have been known to 
the crime bosses). So it would have been more logical to settle 
the score not with Aizderdzis but with the editor, who, 
according to MDK-Bank staff, had not coordinated this 
publication with Aizderdzis. 
<H5>  Conflict With Partner </H5>
  The day after the murder Anatoliy Kuznetsov, the founder of 
MDK and former chairman of the board of MDK-Bank, was summoned 
to the Khimki UVD [Internal Affairs Administration]. As Mr. 
Kuznetsov told the KOMMERSANT correspondent, he and Aizderdzis 
had been friends and partners but parted ways in 1992. Now 
Kuznetsov calls his former partner a "pathologically dishonest 
man," whose traits included "aggressiveness, looking for 
enemies, and creating an environment loyal to him personally." 
Kuznetsov, however, has his own corporation now, and, in his own 
words, long ago dropped all financial claims against Aizderdzis. 
Kuznetsov believes that the cause of the tragedy were the "new 
commercial wheeling-dealings" of his former friend. 
<H5>  "Commercial" Versions of the Murder </H5>
  According to MDK General Director Ponomarev, the deceased 
lately was not engaged in commerce altogether. Investigators 
have their doubts about this. Among others, a version is being 
checked out that the banker was done in by a debtor pushed into 
a corner by persistent demands for payment. And, according to 
MDK-Bank's management, there are quite a few people who owe it 
money (more than R500 million in unrepaid loans). Neither does 
the investigation preclude the possibility that one of the 
companies that had been part of MDK itself got into debt. A 
company mentioned in particular in this connection is Telecon, 
which is part of the corporation and which had promised for half 
a year already to repay R0.5 billion to the Roskontrakt company. 
  The investigators are also checking whether Aizderdzis' 
demise is linked in any way with the murder of entrepreneur 
Tayvo Laos. On 18 April 1994 the latter was stabbed five time 
with a knife by unknown assailants in the Ukraine hotel. 
According to unofficial data, Mr. Laos worked in an Estonian law 
firm and in addition did some trading in nonferrous metals 
(exporting them from Russia to the Baltics). It is possible that 
Aizderdzis and Laos knew one another, since the MDK also engaged 
in metal trading--only ferrous and only inside Russia, however, 
according to Mr. Ponomarev. 
  Yesterday operatives received information that five 
pump-action Winchester rifles (the type of a weapon used by the 
murderer) had been brought in from abroad by a friend of the 
victim. Aizderdzis gave four of them as a gift to partners and 
friends (including the aforementioned Aleksey Ponomarev, 
Aleksandr Gayderov, and Anatoliy Kuznetsov), and kept one for 
himself. The investigation is trying to find out where the fifth 
rifle is and whether it was the one used by the criminal to kill 
the deputy. 
  [begin box] 
  Andrey Daynisovich Aizderdzis, born 1958. 
Graduated from vocational high school. Lived in a small 
three-room apartment in the town of Khimki in suburban Moscow. 
Married, with a son and a daughter. Before starting the 
International Business Corporation worked as a construction site 
supervisor. By his own admission, he had been "drinking heavily" 
for a long time, but even before going into commerce had 
"changed," and stopped using alcohol altogether. 
  Held the position of chairman of the board of MDK-Bank and 
MDK chairman of the board, but stepped down after being elected 
to the State Duma. He did not resign, however, as MDK founder, 
and also remained chairman of the board of the Foundation for 
Mutual Aid and Support of the Population. Through this 
foundation MDK-Bank financed the city newspaper VPERED. 
  He did not carry a weapon. During the election campaign Mr. 
Aizderdzis was accompanied by members of the MDK security 
service; after the elections he refused to have bodyguards. 
According to his brother Aleksandr, there had been no threats 
against the deputy. [end box]

Recognized Criminal World Authorities Are Not Immune From 
Criminal Lawlessness"]

<H5>  The "Queen of England" of the Caucasus Mafia </H5>
  The first victim arrived in the admissions room of the 
Balashikha TsRB [central rayon hospital] at 0940. Surgeons 
diagnosed the condition without hesitation: bullet wound to the 
right thigh. The wounded man--30-year-old Chechen 
Osmayev--reported that he had been shot on Razina Street near 
the office of the Rosinter company. At 1010 local resident 
Marina B. was brought to the same hospital with a bullet wound 
to a buttock. 
  A group of operatives that went to the site of the incident 
barely got there in time. In the Volga sedan speeding out of the 
city they detained a Rosinter company administrator and two 
local residents without any particular employment. Under the car 
seat the detectives from the ninth department of the oblast GUVD 
[City Administration of Internal Affairs] Regional Organized 
Crime Administration [RUOP] discovered a TT handgun and a couple 
of loaded magazines (with three and seven cartridges). It soon 
became clear why the magazines were not full. In the trunk of 
the car was the body of mortally wounded 30-year-old Deryabin, a 
resident of Zheleznodorozhnyy, also not employed. He died an 
hour later without regaining consciousness in the intensive care 
unit of the Balashikha TsRB from a bullet would to the eye. 
  The operatives encountered the main "surprise" later, 
however. In the course of a ground search near the woods behind 
Novaya village they discovered another corpse. The body of a 
young man dressed in a well-made denim suit had been dumped in a 
roadside ditch and covered with snow. The experienced detectives 
realized that they were not dealing with an ordinary 
"score-settling." They recognized the man, killed by a shot 
through the back of his head, as 38-year-old Daudov--a 
well-known "crime boss" nicknamed Sultan... 
  In the complex and constantly changing table of ranks of the 
criminal world, Sultan had long held a special place. Suffice it 
to say that he had been the only "crime boss" among the 
Chechens. As is known, this ethnic group does not recognize the 
traditions of "bosses" commonly followed in the criminal world. 
Chechens remain faithful to their tribal ties and treat clan 
elders with respect. Even the so-called "kitty"--a "thieves'" 
treasury which exists mainly to support authorities and 
"bosses," delivering parcels of "gravy" to investigative 
detention facilities and labor camps, is made up of foreign 
currency--not "wooden" rubles--"contributions" among Chechens. 
Because of these circumstances, Sultan was considered a stranger 
among their own both among Chechens and among Russians. 
  Sultan had four convictions. The first--a three-year prison 
term--he got in his native Groznyy back in 1972. All in all he 
had accumulated 14 years behind barbed wire... He did time in 
the zone in Saratov, Bryansk, Tula, Voronezh, Rostov, and Moscow 
Oblasts. As operatives who had known him tell it, Sultan was not 
a simpleton. An offspring of a prominent Chechen family 
(according to some data his father had worked as a party 
functionary in Chechnya), he had his own view of many things, 
and intellectually was far above most criminals around him. 
Sultan liked to philosophize, gladly proffered advice (and not 
bad at that, from what we heard), and was moderate in his use of 
alcohol. He did have a weakness--grass; he could not stay off 
it. However, even in prison Sultan kept up appearances--was 
cleanly shaven, neat, and calm. 
  He left his family, was "crowned" in prison by Georgian 
"bosses," and since then became something like the "Queen of 
England" among Chechens. They recognized his authority, but did 
not consider him "kin." Perhaps these circumstances eventually 
led to Sultan's demise. 
<H5>  Are "Thieves" Brothers? </H5>
  That morning Sultan, accompanied by his bodyguard Deryabin, 
was leaving for Crimea for a meeting with a local authority 
nicknamed Shoe. When their Jeep was on its way to the airport, 
Sultan suddenly suggested that they stop briefly at Rosinter on 
business. 
  Deryabin was the first to walk into the office. Sultan 
lingered for a moment--he was showing something to driver 
Osmayev on the car's dashboard. Subsequent events are still to 
be reconstructed in detail. (For quite understandable reasons, 
witnesses to the murder prefer to keep their mouths shut.) It is 
obvious, however, that Sultan and his "cover" were dealt with 
professionally, calmly, and cruelly. The operatives also believe 
that the victim had a large amount of money from the "kitty" on 
him. The money has not yet been found. Oblast RUOP detectives 
also know the names of the murderers. What is not entirely clear 
is the motive for the murder--who is behind the shooting in the 
Rosinter office? 
  One of the versions is revenge for Balashikha authority 
Frol, 
killed on the last day of last year (PODMOSKOVYE No. 9 devoted 
an article "Epitaph for a `Godfather'" to this event). Frol had 
a long-running feud with the "Chechen community"--he was one of 
the leaders of the "Slavic wing" of the domestic mafia. He was 
threatened many times, and the confrontation, which by some 
estimates had been going on since 1988, in 1993 spilled out into 
a series of score-settling altercations between Frol's shock 
troopers and the Caucasians. On 18 August, for instance, Frol's 
villa was fired at by a grenade launcher. The victim decided not 
to report the incident to the militia. "Maybe gasoline canisters 
exploded in the garage," he told detectives. Frol's response was 
much more "tangible." Soon a series of explosions rolled through 
Chechen-"protected" sales outlets in Balashikha Rayon. 
  Sultan lived in Balashikha and of course knew Frol well. 
Frol 
even contributed money to the "kitty." So far there are no 
grounds, however, to contend that he was the person who gave the 
"green light" to Frol's killing. Neither can one say with 
certainty that Frol's group had something to do with Sultan's 
death. There are other versions as well. 
  Frol was not the only one to take a stand against the 
Chechens' preponderance in the capital city metropolitan area. 
According to operatives, "bosses" do not like the Chechens, 
considering them people who do not live by the law of the 
criminals. The Chechens constantly clash with "bosses" and 
invade the territory of others, which results in armed clashes 
and score-settling. This also explains the attitude of the 
"bosses'" lobby to the Chechen authorities. "Crime bosses" do 
not want Chechens to have a voice at "conferences." In this 
respect, Sultan's behavior was indicative in that he had tried 
twice to promote Mairbek, a Chechen, to "thief" status. The 
attempts failed twice... The late Globe [Globus] was also 
unhappy with Sultan. The famous "boss" said more than once that 
Sultan was "flaky," that is, gave the "boss" title to young 
criminals who had not earned this "high honor." Interestingly, a 
young leader nicknamed Pushkin (he controlled Podolsk and 
Serpukhov), who had been "crowned" by Sultan last year, was 
"quietly" shot dead by an unknown assailant. For a real 
authoritative "boss" this is impermissible. The death of any of 
them is an extraordinary event, which is discussed at a 
"conference," with appropriate "organizational conclusions." 
  Sultan's relations with the late "boss" Barberry [Kalina] 
were no less strained. Barberry's derogatory remarks about the 
Chechens (behind his back he called Sultan an ape and a Czech) 
compelled Sultan to threaten to kill him. So Barberry, having 
figured out that he was playing with fire, went to Serpukhov, 
where Sultan was sitting in the SIZO [preliminary investigative 
detention facility], and apologized to the "comrade" for 
"accidentally dropped words." In the Serpukhov SIZO, on the 
other hand, the attitude toward the Chechen was that of utmost 
respect. Two local "bosses" treated Sultan with attention 
appropriate to his rank. This is understandable--no "boss" will 
insult another one in his face. As is known, "bosses" are 
brothers. 
<H5>  Going to Crimea--Taken to Chechnya </H5>
  After Sultan's murder, an assassination attempt was made 
against his good friend, a Lyubertsy authority nicknamed Avil. 
The latter was nearly shot to death in Solntsevo by an unknown 
criminal. The killer fired several shots from a Makarov handgun 
when Avil left his apartment to walk his dog. He did not die, 
but ended up in a very serious condition in a hospital. 
  The operatives remember an incident that happened back in 
1989 at the Old Castle restaurant. It all started with some 
Caucasians occupying a table next to the one where Sultan and 
Avil were sitting began to get rowdy. Sultan walked over to 
them, introduced himself, and asked them to tone it down. The 
mountain people, high from all the wine they had drunk, told the 
"boss" to get lost. Naturally, a fight ensued in which the 
"boss" ended up with broken ribs and a cracked skull. The next 
day Avil came to the Old Castle, shot the bartender dead with a 
sawn-off shotgun, and mortally wounded one of Sultan's offenders 
with a sharpened screwdriver... 
  Does this story offer an explanation of the demise of the 
Chechen "boss"? I think this version does not hold water even by 
a long stretch of imagination. Neither does another one 
frequently discussed by journalists. They talk about the 
so-called supersecret "White Arrow" team allegedly created on 
the personal orders of the Russian MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] leadership for secret suppression of criminal 
"authorities." Those who have gained a knowledge of the criminal 
world mores from operational work experience rather than from 
newspaper articles do not take this tale seriously. It is 
obvious that the "White Arrow" myth is being spread precisely by 
those bandits who want to write off the blood and murder of 
their own confederates to the militia. The causal connection 
here is much more simple and material. Behind the death of every 
"boss" is enormous money, influence, and a complex disposition 
of forces in the criminal world and the criminal economy. So why 
did Sultan, who was heading for the warm sea of Crimea, end up 
traveling in a casket to his native Chechnya? 
  Operatives think it possible that the cause of Sultan's 
demise may lie in his sharing a neighborhood with Zakhar, also a 
"boss" who lives in Balashikha. The latter is known as an 
authority who sticks to strict labor camp traditions. He never 
concealed his Slavic orientation and claim to leadership in his 
territory. According to detectives, Zakhar cannot stand the 
Chechens. He knows the "law" very well, but he knows equally 
well the golden rule: As a rule, the fight is won by whoever 
strikes first and strikes hard. And, as they say, the winners 
are not judged... 
  Was a "shoot" set up for Sultan in the office? And if it 
was, 
by whom and why? In keeping with tradition, only an equal--that 
is, another "boss"--can make an appointment for a "boss." 
Actually, the hidden springs of this incident are still not 
known. But the operatives, while not dismissing the possibility 
of Zakhar's involvement in the bloody "score-settling," know 
perfectly well that he himself did not kill Sultan. It is just 
that any lead deserves attention and discussion. 
  ...Over the last half-year alone dozens of criminal world 
authorities have been killed in the Moscow region; well-known 
crime bosses have fallen victim to shootouts and contract 
murders. It is an unprecedented situation; not a single one 
among experienced detectives can recall anything like this. 
These days a bullet fired by a small-time criminal, who has 
barely staked his place among his kind, may take the life of a 
criminal world "patriarch," a single word from whom in the past 
could change the situation in entire oblasts of Russia. 
  The "thieves" Globe, Pipiya, Pushkin, and Arsen have been 
killed. Givi Scarface disappeared without a trace. Georgian 
"boss" Roin also faded into the night while driving home from a 
casino. Sultan has been shot dead... And an uncountable number 
of less prominent personalities. Bobon was torn apart by a 
submachine gun burst; Little Falcon [Sokolenok] shot dead in 
front of his apartment; Mikota died of a gunshot would to the 
head in a cafe in Kolomenskoye; in Lyubertsy, Hare [Zayats] died 
at the door of his own home; Kruglov, nicknamed Beard [Boroda], 
was found in Yauza river with a garrote around his neck. There 
is a virtual hunt for the "boss" nicknamed Signature [Rospis], 
who is considered the most active fighter against the Caucasian 
preponderance in the capital city region. 
  Signature has been hit by a sniper bullet twice. The first 
time he was saved by a bullet-proof vest; the second--by his 
bodyguard Sharapov, who was killed on the spot. Signature did 
not escape unharmed, though. The same bullet that killed 
Sharapov hit the "boss" in the liver and tore through his 
kidney. It was a miracle that he lived; he flew to the United 
States, had surgery there, returned, and came under fire again. 
When he left his home accompanied by his bodyguard Shaykhullin 
and headed for his Volga car, unknown perpetrators blew up a car 
parked nearby. The charge was so powerful that all the windows 
in the building--from the first to the 10th floor--were 
shattered. This is not the worst, however. Innocent bystanders 
were hurt--two girls playing in the courtyard, and two 
passers-by. The bodyguard was also killed on the spot. Signature 
survived and was taken to hospital in a critical condition. 
Doctors list his condition as satisfactory. Quite possibly, 
Signature will soon get back into business again. A reasonable 
question, through: For how long? And another one: What will the 
killers come up with this time to find a more reliable way to 
eliminate the adversary? Perhaps blow up an overpass as 
Signature's car travels on it? Or will they blow up an entire 
rayon when the authority holds an appointed meeting? Operatives 
believe, however, that Signature may feel it is prudent to leave 
again for the United States... 
  Lawlessness [bespredel]. This slang word, which means 
mocking 
even the norms of "morality" commonly accepted in the criminal 
world, is increasingly often defining our current life. First we 
registered a rise in crime, then we had to admit that it had 
practically got out of control. And finally we agreed that crime 
itself has undergone a qualitative change. Now lawlessness has 
become the norm rather than the exception, and fighting 
gangsters who have long lost the notion of propriety is not just 
difficult--it is nearly impossible. 
  "Our laws, the criminal and criminal process codes, 
normative 
acts, and other juridical mechanisms were created with a 
civilized society in mind," is the opinion of Aleksandr 
Kartashev, chief of the Moscow Oblast GUVD Regional Organized 
Crime Department. "They do not meet the requirements of the 
current situation, cannot protect to a full extent society and 
its citizens. People get shot, blown up, and stabbed to death in 
broad daylight. Brainless, stupid retards pull the trigger 
without a second thought. The situation is increasingly often 
characterized as extraordinary. What do we have to counter this 
lawlessness? Almost nothing except the courage and enthusiasm of 
our staff. Hiding behind the letter of the law, leaders and 
authorities find loopholes in the criminal code with the help of 
high-powered lawyers and escape punishment. In order to 
realistically grab a gang organizer, we need a law on criminal 
activities, a law on protection of witnesses, and a law on 
organized crime. It is necessary to toughen the penalties for 
illegal possession of weapons and ammunition. We should think 
through how to punish the mercenaries who are coming here from 
"hot spots" and are ready to commit any crime. Until these 
issues are resolved, we can hardly expect results commensurate 
with the militia's efforts in its struggle against runaway crime.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Ilyukhin, Chairman of the State Duma Security </F>
Committee: "Half Their Ill-Gotten Gains as a Bribe: There Are 
Some People Who Do Not Like the Anticorruption Laws"] 
  [Text] On 13 May 1994 the State Duma adopted on first 
reading the draft laws "On Combating Corruption" and "On 
Amendments and Additions to the RSFSR Criminal Code and the 
RSFSR Criminal Procedure Code." The drafts were submitted by 
deputies S. Boskholov, V. Kolmakov, and V. Kosykh, members of 
the State Duma Security Committee, and the author of these lines. 
  Clearly not everyone knows that in 1993 the bullet-riddled 
Russian Federation Supreme Soviet adopted the law "On Combating 
Corruption" but President B. Yeltsin refused to sign it, even 
though such a law had long been needed. 
  The changes that have taken place in the social and state 
system inevitably caused drastic changes in the character of 
crime and the forms in which it is manifested. Crime today is 
more organized and ruthless, better armed and larger in scale, 
more professional and transnational. We still have not fully 
realized or calculated the colossal harm that has been and is 
being caused to ordinary workers and the intelligentsia through 
the replacement of collective forms of labor and social 
ownership by predatory private ownership, egoism, and 
self-seeking. 
  In Russia today at least 3 million citizens a year are 
victims of criminal acts. According to Russian Federation MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs] statistics, there are more than 
150 major criminal communities operating on the country's 
territory. There are over 35,000 economic sites within their 
sphere of influence. By virtue of its destructive consequences 
and the massive loss of human life incurred, crime has become a 
Russian national disaster. 
  Crime has become politicized and seeks to seize the leading 
positions in the echelons of power. Criminal groupings now 
exert direct influence on the adoption of administrative 
decisions not only at rayon, city, and oblast level but at 
republic level, too. They try to influence the legislative 
process. And their ringleaders and ideological inspirers view 
the path to power as the path to self-preservation. All spheres 
of the shadow economy -- drug trafficking, smuggling, 
prostitution, and gambling dens -- are under the complete 
control of organized crime. It has managed to take control of 
industrial production, diamond and gold extraction, the oil 
industry, and the credit and finance system. 
  According to Russian Academy of Sciences Analysis Center 
estimates, 55 percent of the capital and 80 percent of the 
voting shares in Russia are in the hands of criminal or foreign 
capital. This is happening not without the assistance of the 
Russian Federation State Committee for the Management of State 
Property, headed by Vice Premier A. Chubays. 
  The increase in income from crime has spawned the 
large-scale 
expansion of corruption in the state apparatus from the bottom 
upward, and especially in the upper echelons of power. I would 
probably not be wrong if I said that Russia today has the most 
corrupt executive it has ever had in its entire history. And 
whereas in the eighties crooks spent up to 35 percent of their 
ill-gotten gains on bribing officials, now they spend 50 percent 
or more for the purpose. 
  Corruption has affected the state structures, the credit and 
finance system, and business like a blight. It has become a 
dangerous brake on the transformations in the country, is 
nullifying the effectiveness and significance of all state 
programs, and it has jeopardized the country's national 
security, constitutional rights, and civil liberties. 
  In 1993 more than 52,000 corruption-related crimes were 
exposed. Of those people prosecuted for such actions, 42.7 
percent were ministry, committee, or local power structure 
personnel, 25.8 percent were law enforcement agency employees, 
11.3 percent were employed in the credit and finance system, 2.2 
percent were deputies, and 3.8 percent were monitoring agency 
staff. In the banking system 4,300 crimes were exposed -- 
mainly instances of theft, bribery, and abuse of position. The 
area which suffered most from lawbreaking was the privatization 
process, implemented under the control of and with the 
participation of the State Committee for the Management of State 
Property. Last year alone the Prosecutor's Office challenged 
over 2,200 unlawful privatization documents, registered more 
than 2,500 complaints about violations that had been exposed, 
and filed 677 law suits. Around 1,000 officials had 
disciplinary, administrative, and material proceedings 
instituted against them. So there is no point in Mr Chubays' 
railing against just criticism of his activity. He is 
personally to blame for the destructive character of 
privatization, which is disastrous for Russia. 
  Much is being written and said about the pernicious effects 
of corruption today, first and foremost by B. Yeltsin and the 
Russian Government. However, no radical measures have yet been 
taken to nip it in the bud. The presidential structures include 
an enormous legal administration. You might think that this 
administration ought to prepare draft legislative acts aimed at 
preventing corruption. But no. The drafts were prepared by 
deputies and a group of academics and law enforcement agency 
practical personnel who are fanatically devoted to their cause 
and who feel deeply for Russia's destiny. The funding of the 
state's anticrime program for 1994-1995 is now being cut to the 
bone by that same government. Thus it is saying one thing but 
doing something completely different. That is why, despite the 
massive scale of the bribery of officials, the number of people 
convicted of bribe-taking last year was around 700, as against 
1986 when 3,450 people were convicted of these offenses. 
  As you can see, there is an enormous discrepancy here. But 
that is not the only point. Even the draft laws that we do 
propose are torpedoed. Most often they are rejected within the 
presidential and government structures as well as by deputies 
from or connected with ministries. 
  During the vote on first reading the anticorruption laws 
were 
opposed by the Russia's Choice faction and, specifically, by its 
leaders Ye. Gaydar, G. Burbulis, M. Mityukov, G. Yakunin, and E. 
Panfilova. Clearly this is no coincidence either. For many 
people corruption has become a major source of personal wealth 
and an effective means of bringing down the country. 
  As for the official arguments cited by the opponents of the 
draft laws that were presented, they essentially constitute a 
long list of unsubstantiated accusations. I shall dwell on just 
a few of them. Our opponents claim that the drafts are 
imperfect. Of course they have shortcomings. But the draft 
laws were only given a first reading. That should be followed 
by the second and third readings, which enable the imperfections 
to be remedied. 
  It was suggested to us that amendments be made to the 
existing Criminal Code. But it is out of date, and work is now 
underway on a new code of criminal legislation. 
  A large group of deputies and eminent academic lawyers well 
known both at home and abroad spent a long time working on the 
draft laws. They have been compiled on the basis of an in-depth 
study of Russian life and legal practice. When they were being 
elaborated account was taken of foreign experience in combating 
corruption, of the law in the United States, the FRG, Italy, and 
other countries, and the opinion of foreign experts. 
  Particular attention was paid to the materials of the Eighth 
UN Crime Prevention Congress held in Havana in August-September 
1990. The congress firmly advised all countries of the world 
community to prepare a strategy for fighting corruption as a 
priority area in the economic and social development of society. 
  In our opinion, if the drafts that we proposed to the State 
Duma are adopted as laws they will constitute a major barrier 
and effective antidote to the pernicious influence of corruption. 
  They apply not only to state employees but also to employees 
of the local organs of self-government and the armed forces, 
judges, deputies and their aides, people's assessors, and 
jurors, as well as to employees of banks and other credit and 
finance institutions and transport and communications 
establishments and their enterprises, regardless of the form of 
ownership. 
  It is proposed that once the drafts are legally enacted they 
will apply throughout Russian territory. According to these 
drafts persons seeking to perform state functions freely 
undertake an obligation not to allow their status to be used for 
unofficial personal or group purposes. 
  Control measures of a disciplinary, financial, and criminal 
law nature are envisaged. State employees and their equivalent 
will be required to submit an annual declaration of their income 
and declare all bank accounts, including those held abroad, as 
well as property outside Russia together with the full address. 
  State employees are forbidden to hold more than one post or 
to take part in the activity of commercial joint-stock 
companies. The draft laws offer a reliable protection against 
extortion, cash handouts, and dubious gifts concealing graft. 
  It should be noted that under the draft law on combating 
corruption not only by physical persons but also by legal 
persons, organizations, and commercial structures can be 
penalized for trying to bribe officials or furnish them with 
other material advantages.

<F P=106> [Interview with N. Borodin, chief of the Department of GU </F>
GAI MVD RF, by Yuriy Ursov: "A Barrier to Vehicle Thieves: 
Innovations of Russian GAI Should Be Raised Against Them"] 
  [Text] Russian reforms have affected even the 
extremely conservative sphere of organizing and regulating 
highway traffic, including the procedure for registering and 
arranging for registration of motor vehicle transport. N. 
Borodin, chief of the Department of the GU GAI MVD RF [Russian 
Federation State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate Main Administration 
of the Ministry of Internal Affairs], tells us about some of the 
innovations developed by Gosavtoinspektsiya [State Motor Vehicle 
Inspectorate]. 
  [Ursov] Nikolay Georgiyevich, the stealing of personal and 
state motor vehicle transport has recently taken on a simply 
menacing scale. In the opinion of some specialists, in Moscow 
alone, more vehicles are stolen every day than are purchased.... 
  [Borodin] The deep-seated reasons for this form of crime 
becoming such a widescale practice in recent years should be 
sought, in my opinion, in the general criminalization of Russian 
life. In actual fact, a car worth several million rubles (if not 
tens of millions) is parked on the street. Moreover, these 
millions are mobile, they are on wheels. One doesn't have to 
force the doors or, worse still, resort to armed robbery. It is 
enough, having studied the alarm system and the routes and 
habits of the owner, just to drive the car off to a secluded 
spot -- you are a millionaire. Such an easy path to criminal 
enrichment, of course, attracts many people, especially since 
the law interprets this form of crime in a vague, ambiguous way: 
was the car stolen with further unlawful intent, or was it 
"taken to go for a drive." The punishment is therefore not 
comparable with the material damage incurred by the owner. 
Moreover, the criminals often use juveniles, to whom criminal 
responsibility, even mild responsibility, does not apply. How 
many people have repeatedly spoken of the need to make the 
punishment tougher, to eliminate ambiguity in the interpretation 
of vehicle theft, but... the situation remains the same. 
  Nevertheless, GAI is making maximum use of the existing 
legal 
possibilities in order to limit the field of action for the 
criminal elements. In the first place, of course, our associates 
are organizing searches and checks "for hot clues." We are 
making raids on garages and parking lots. Incidentally, through 
this last measure, dozens of cars figuring in the search were 
discovered in Moscow. There is another aspect of this work, 
though. Stealing the vehicle is just half of the job. It still 
has to be legalized, that is, provided with the appropriate 
documents.... 
  [Ursov] Judging by the fact that, for example, the stolen 
vehicles regularly "surface" at certain motor vehicle auctions, 
in vehicle showrooms, etc., does this make the criminals 
successful? 
  [Borodin] Let us put it this way: they used to be 
successful. 
I think that it will now be much more difficult to pull off 
schemes like this. The reason for this is the new procedure for 
legalizing and registering cars, which prevents the 
manufacturing of fake documents. Every domestic motor vehicle 
now receives a technical certificate at the manufacturing plant, 
on which data concerning a change in owner in the course of the 
operating period are entered. The owner keeps this certificate 
at home or at his establishment, and the driver must carry on 
him evidence of registration, which certifies his right to drive 
the vehicle. In this way we can trace the entire buying-selling 
chain of a certain specific car, detecting any suspicious gaps. 
Unfortunately, the State Customs Committee is not so far trying 
to introduce documents of this sort for imported cars. 
  The operations procedure at many of the commercial 
structures 
trading in motor vehicles has also changed. Now they must have a 
license, issued by the local organs of authority with all the 
ensuing consequences, in particular, responsibility for the 
authenticity of the registration documents, for the sale of cars 
figuring in the search, etc. New forms of certificate-records 
have been introduced, and have become documents for strict 
accounting. In Moscow and a few other areas, we are starting to 
counter sink the vehicle markings, so that if there is an 
attempt to register a vehicle with battered numbers, this is 
easily detected. It must be said that such measures have already 
begun to show results: the percentage of thefts exposed has 
begun to grow slowly. This work would be more effective if the 
activity of numerous private notaries were monitored more 
strictly. After all, it is much easier to make a fake document 
for a vehicle than, let us say, a fake technical certificate. 
  The ideal thing -- and this has been a question for several 
years -- GAI intends to make the transition to full 
computerization, as happened, for example, in Krasnodar Kray. 
There, the staff members of the State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate 
are equipped with portable computers, and if necessary, can get 
a direct line to a centralized data bank which instantly 
provides full information on both a vehicle and on the 
violations of its driver. 
  [Ursov] One has recently begun to come across vehicles on 
the 
streets, not only with the new type of state numbers, but also 
with a few unusual number designations in yellow and red.... 
  [Borodin] The white numbers of the new type for domestic 
vehicles, I remind you, are unified to conform with the 
requirements for international standards. There is no division 
into private and state vehicles, and one can travel to all 
foreign countries with these numbers. As for the yellow and red 
numbers, they belong to special categories of vehicle owners. At 
one time we used, for foreign citizens -- not diplomats -- 
different number series: one for journalists, another for trade 
representatives, etc. Now all these categories, including 
non-citizens, joint ventures, etc., receive yellow numbers. 
Diplomats and persons on equal footing with them use the red 
numbers. 
  [Ursov] I have often noticed: using a red and blue special 
signal light, some "Mercedes" with personal numbers "cuts 
through" the traffic, but the person behind the wheel bears 
little resemblance to a state official or operations worker. 
  [Borodin] Yes, there are such cases. In order to look 
prestigious, businessmen install special flashing lights, since 
it is easy to get them right now. This is illegal, and we are 
putting a stop to such cases. An edict of the Russian President 
determined the group of those enjoying the use of special signal 
lights. These are higher officials, and also some ministries and 
departments which, because of their type of activity, need 
special signal lights. For example, the Ministry for Emergency 
Situations, bank collection and delivery and public health 
department vehicles and, of course, fire department vehicles, 
ambulances.... 
  Moreover, special signal lights may now be only blue, and 
are 
mounted in strictly defined spots on the roof of the vehicle. A 
procedure has been determined for special colors for the 
vehicles. For the police it is blue and white, for fire vehicles 
-- red, for bank collection vehicles -- sand-colored, etc. I 
will note that the new procedure for placing special signal 
lights and special coloring has considerably narrowed the group 
of people having this right. Remember, it used to be that 
special signal lights were practically granted to a kolkhoz 
chairman. All this is now taken under strict consideration and 
monitored. 
  [Ursov] And in conclusion, a question which is worrying a 
great many potential motor vehicle owners. By this I mean the 
new Draconian duties on the import of motor vehicles. 
  [Borodin] I personally do not understand the logic of the 
people who drew up this document. I will not go into details, 
but this is the way Russia is becoming a place where they "dump" 
all sorts of, pardon the term, trash, which satisfies neither 
ecological nor technical norms. This means -- new emergencies, 
nature pollution, and so on. All civilized countries, though, 
behave in a different way: the older the vehicle that you drive, 
the more tax you pay. Or are we so rich that we pay for battered 
vehicles in currency, which was originally gained from the sale 
of top-value oil, gas, timber and other irreplaceable resources?

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Medvedev, president of Rosavtotrans, by </F>
M. Yevsyukov, deputy chief editor of AVTOMOBILNYY TRANSPORT; 
date and place not given: "Our Task is to Protect the Interests 
of the Founders (A conversation with the president of the 
Russian motor transport joint-stock company `Rosavtotrans')"] 
  [Text] At the threshold of the new year the editorial staff 
of AVTOMOBILNYY TRANSPORT has applied to the president of the 
"Rosavtotrans" company, V. Medvedev, with a request to tell 
about its work and its prospects. We report his conversation 
with M. Yevsyukov, deputy chief editor. 
  [Yevsyukov] Vasiliy Dmitriyevich, there is now in principle 
no division whatever, at least officially, of motor transport 
into general-use and departmental transport, although the tasks 
and the work which general-use motor transport performed have 
remained. You won't get away from them under any privatization, 
setting-up of joint-stock companies, etc. By the way, all this 
was intended precisely to improve the work of motor transport in 
servicing the top priority needs of society. However, as yet all 
has not gone well with this. 
  The Russian motor transport joint-stock company 
"Rosavtotrans" has now been created and is in operation. Please 
tell us about its work, functions, and tasks. 
  [Medvedev] Let's begin with the fact that "Rosavtotrans" has 
been created on a strictly voluntary basis. It doesn't perform 
any state functions and commissions whatsoever. Territorial 
joint-stock companies, which basically all general-use motor 
transport enterprises have become members of, have created it. 
The tasks and functions of the company are defined by its 
charter. What functions would I call the most important? 
  At the present stage the most important function, in my 
opinion, is to protect the interests of the possessors of 
general-use motor transport in the structures of state power. 
This is against the ministries of transportation, finance, 
economics, and defense (many of our enterprises are rather 
firmly connected with that ministry) and with other state power 
structures where general-use motor transport has interests. 
  The next basic functions are the questions of the 
material-technical support of our enterprises and the 
coordination of their work. This is the basic group of questions 
on which our company must work. 
  We don't have at our disposal any official powers whatsoever 
with respect to the territorial associations and enterprises 
that are the founding members. We perform only that volume of 
work and only those functions which the founders have entrusted 
to us. That is, both planning and the work itself goes from the 
bottom to the top. 
  What now are the main problems today and what are the ways 
of 
resolving them? One of the main problems is the presently 
inadequately developed system for the realization through our 
company of the interests of the founders in the state power 
structures. Old approaches frequently prevail in these 
structures, including the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Transportation. They think there that their decisions are, as it 
is said, final and irrevocable and all these decisions must be 
unhesitatingly implemented in the localities. 
  [Yevsyukov] And what, this is wrong? In my opinion that's 
the 
way it should be. All decisions should be implemented; only then 
will there be order. 
  [Medvedev] All that is true, but I don't want to talk about 
that. You see the whole point is how these normative documents 
and legislative acts are to be prepared. As I have already said, 
our company has not been endowed with any official functions 
relative to motor transport structures in the localities but 
must protect their interests. But how is this to be done? 
Primarily through tracking, monitoring, and participation in the 
development of all normative documents. However, we all have 
come out of a single power structure--the Russian Ministry of 
Motor Vehicle Transport. In its time it was entrusted with both 
official functions and protection of the interests of the 
enterprises. We're all from there: both the workers of the 
Ministry of Transportation, the Department of Motor Vehicle 
Transport, and our company. That is why there remains a 
psychological inertia among executives and a command style of 
work survives. Of course they ought to constantly bring us in 
and we should find the time and the opportunities to participate 
in the development of all normative documents. However, it 
doesn't always turn out that way. Frequently the workers of the 
Department and the Ministry of Transportation think that they 
know everything without us. This applies to document 
elaborations, the distribution of budget resources, and other 
questions. And we, probably, don't announce ourselves loudly and 
persistently enough. But nevertheless a reciprocal "rubbing" 
takes place. I think that not much time will be needed for 
mutual recognition and mutual understanding to be established. 
Otherwise neither the ministry nor we will be able to operate. 
  The second main direction of our activity, as I have already 
said, is the work regarding the material-technical support of 
the company's enterprises. One cannot assume that each of the 
company's 2,200 enterprises will be able to completely resolve 
independently all the questions of material-technical support. 
Today already about 60 percent of these enterprises have been 
privatized and the remainder are in the stage of becoming 
joint-stock companies. Delays are occurring because there are 
complications with the privatization of the numbered vehicle 
convoys. 
  [Yevsyukov] Incidentally, about the privatization of these 
convoys. Has the Russian Government's decree on this question 
finally been issued? 
  [Medvedev] As yet there is no such decree. Its draft has 
long 
since been prepared by the Ministry of Transportation with the 
direct participation of the "Rosavtotrans" company and been 
endorsed by the Ministry of Defense. However, it hasn't been 
signed as yet. 
  [Yevsyukov] But the fact is that there already was a 
decision 
of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property 
regarding this question, where everything was specified already. 
Only a decision of the government was needed. Why is it being 
obstructed? 
  [Medvedev] Both the interests of the state and of our 
vehicle 
convoys should be provided for in the government's decree. But 
the decision of the Russian Federation State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property is one-sided. Only what the 
vehicle convoy should do and how it should answer to the state 
for the performance of mobilization functions is stipulated 
there. But what the state should do to ensure the performance of 
these functions is not indicated there. And if it is not the 
system will not work. The fact is that today, given such 
extremely high prices and the size of interest rates on bank 
loans (210 percent and more), it is practically impossible to 
acquire the motor vehicles needed to perform mobilization 
functions. 
  That is why the state should stipulate its own obligations 
to 
the vehicle convoys in the decree. These are both preferential 
financing and tax abatements and a number of other questions 
which would contribute to ensuring the mobilization readiness of 
the vehicle convoys. So that the question of the privatization 
of numbered vehicle convoys is very difficult and it is 
precisely among that group in which the company must protect the 
interests of its founders in the state power structures. 
  However, let's return to material-technical support. Now it 
is being implemented on a fundamentally different basis. If 
before we shared what the government allotted us, now there is 
nothing to share. Go, come to an understanding with the 
producers and suppliers, and decide all these questions. Of 
course, it's difficult even to assume that every enterprise 
could send specialists to solve supply questions to hundreds of 
plants located in different points of the former USSR and 
especially abroad. Suppose, let's assume, one is to obtain buses 
at the Lvov plant or trucks in Belarus and deliver them to a 
location? These are already different states. Licenses to export 
motor vehicles and fuel and a great deal more of what is needed 
are required. 
  It is precisely these functions that the "Rosavtotrans" 
company will undertake. We conclude the appropriate contracts 
with our founders and with suppliers and perform this work. 
  [Yevsyukov] And the company, I mean its staff, has something 
to do with this? 
  [Medvedev] Questions about the upkeep of the company's 
executive staff are decided by its founders. In the case in 
question they have voted for the transfer to us of 2 percent for 
the KamAZ group of motor vehicles and 1.2 percent of the value 
of any other motor vehicles delivered. One must say that this 
money is not enough even to maintain the staff. In order to make 
ends meet we have to engage in other work which is not always 
connected with our founding members. 
  We do work on material-technical support not only in Russia 
and the CIS countries, but also, as they say now, with the 
countries of the far abroad. In particular, today we are 
resolving the question of acquiring second-hand motor buses of 
the Mercedes, MAN and Magirus firms which we can operate for 
three to six years. The cost of such motor buses and their 
service lives correspond with the lives and cost of our new 
motor buses. 
  [Yevsyukov] What number are we talking about? 
  [Medvedev] For now the number is in the tens. However, we 
intend already this year (1993) to acquire 300-400 of them and 
to bring the number up to 1000 in the beginning of 1994. 
  If we can implement these plans, we will deprive the Likino 
plant of the privileges it enjoys as the monopoly producer of 
urban motor buses in Russia. It constantly dictates its 
conditions to us which now and then are not well-founded and 
simply impracticable. By this we will force it to enter into a 
competitive struggle. 
  [Yevsyukov] But don't you regret it? You see, when there's 
no 
demand for Likino motor buses, the plant may go bust and western 
firms with their motor vehicles past their best will win the 
Russian market. Our automobile industry will find itself in a 
great state of neglect in the process and perhaps will, in 
general, be overwhelmed by the West. 
  [Medvedev] I simply don't see other ways of restraining the 
overchargings of this plant. No kind of diplomacy and logic 
helps. That is why we have come to such a decision. And what 
they will come to I don't know. Let them think themselves. The 
market is the market. In the end we are, you see, bound to 
transporting tens and hundreds of millions of passengers 
everyday and we cannot wait while our motor bus producers mature 
to an understanding of the necessity and extreme importance of 
performing this task. There is, it is true, hope in KamAZ, which 
has developed and approved a program for the production of urban 
motor buses, their output to begin in 1994 and the volume of 
production to be brought up to 10,000 in 1996-1997, which would 
supply our needs. 
  [Yevsyukov] Vasiliy Dmitriyevich, you have said that one of 
the main tasks of the company is the coordination of the 
activity of its participants, its founders. How is this to be 
done? 
  [Medvedev] First of all, I would like to say what is now to 
be understood under the term "coordination." This is not at all 
an instruction to someone to carry how much and when, to deliver 
how many motor vechicles, to whom, and to where, etc. The most 
important thing now is to determine conditions on the 
transportation market. 
  Transport operations in the pure form now frequently become 
disadvantageous and unprofitable. The volumes of transport 
operations are shrinking rather sharply. What is a motor 
transport enterprise, which has motor vehicles, a production 
base, and, what is the main thing, people to do under these 
conditions? If it is to do nothing and to guess when transport 
operations will develop, then it can collapse completely. And 
meanwhile during the last two years the volume of transport 
operations has shrunk almost in half in connection with the 
reduction in the volumes of industrial production and 
construction. This means that one has to reorganize one's work. 
  We have for a long time already and at all levels talked 
about the need for a drastic increase in the volumes of 
transport and dispatching work. But until now these were 
basically appeals and declarations. This work was perceived as 
unnecessary trouble by the transport workers on the spot. There 
were cargoes, there were orders, and there was no point in 
engaging in such turbulent business as dispatching. Now life is 
developing so that if one is not closely and seriously engaged 
in transport dispatching, then the existence and survival of 
general-use motor transport will be under great question. 
  It needs to be said that this business is indeed profitable 
and promising. One needs simply to investigate it carefully as 
one should, comprehend, and, finally, to master oneself. One 
needs to change priorities. Of course, this is not so simple, 
but it must be done. And some, although so far not so many of 
them, are beginning to engage in this work in real earnest. It 
needs to be said that satisfactory results are being obtained. 
For example, in Sergiyev Posad the former Zagorsk vehicle convoy 
has built a small terminal and the enterprise has 17 percent of 
the total revenue from it. And only 15-17 persons (not counting 
the drivers of international hauls) of the more than 1,500 
persons employed work at this terminal. Now the decrease in the 
volume of transport operations for this motor transport 
enterprise is not extreme. It is able to increase the volumes of 
transport and dispatching services and to live normally and 
develop. 
  That is why we are thinking of examining questions of the 
reorientation of the direction of the work of freight transport 
at the company's council of directors at the end of 1993. And 
generally speaking, one needs to anticipate by several steps the 
implementation of the policy and tactics of the work of the 
company's enterprises. Now, as I have already said, the volumes 
of transport operations are falling. What's the use if we only 
ascertain this? One needs to find, and quickly besides, ways out 
of the situation that has been created. We have a powerful 
production base. It must be utilized efficiently, precisely in 
those directions which are the most effective from the viewpoint 
of the organization of the transportation process and the 
survival of the motor transport enterprises. 
  Finally, I want to say that we, in any case very many, have 
retained a great deal of inertia both in thought and in actions. 
Because of that, under present conditions a great deal of work 
and significant efforts and expenditures of resources are to no 
purpose and futile and yield only losses. On the other hand, 
inertia is manifested in inaction and the anticipation of 
edicts, recommendations and help from above. One needs to get 
free of this. One needs to understand once and for all that if 
we won't take care of ourselves, no one will do it. One can make 
a fuss, complain, and appeal to all levels of authority as much 
as one wants. But it will be the same as appeals to God. Pray as 
much as you want, but in order for there to be some results, one 
needs to use one's head, hands, and often even feet, by oneself. 
As the saying goes, "God is God, and you're not bad either." 
  Of course, the government will give us concrete assistance. 
It is even now giving it in the area of passenger transport 
operations. But such help, I think, will not be increased and 
will be reduced or transferred to local budgets in due course. 
That is why I emphasize again that all the structures of the 
"Rosavtotrans" company, especially the regional ones, need to 
foresee events and work with anticipation. 
  [Yevsyukov] But can the company implement large-scale 
regional or interregional projects? Is there some kind of 
centralized fund for this? 
  [Medvedev] We don't have any such funds at our disposal. 
Only 
the founders themselves can create such a fund. It could be at 
the disposal of the company, which the founders constantly 
monitor. But as yet we don't have such a fund. This, of course, 
does not mean that it is not needed; the financial resources 
needed for this simply don't exist. As it is said, who would 
give us credit and we, for now, aren't able to give credit to 
anybody. Today the financial status of our motor transport 
enterprises is such that they find money for wages and fuel with 
difficulty. However, such a fund is extremely necessary and, I 
think, the company will create it in due course. But we hope 
that the state also will not turn its back on our problems. We 
will try not to allow this. 
  It is very fashionable now to allude to foreign experience, 
to the achievement of a market economy. But I would like to 
emphasize that in all countries the comprehensive transport and 
dispatching servicing of the population and of enterprises is 
always under the control and protection of the state and the 
government. That is why terminal servicing systems are highly 
developed there. This enhances a country's economy as a whole, 
and reduces enormous losses of state resources for 
transportation costs in the national economy. 
  [Yevsyukov] Vasiliy Dmitriyevich, you talked about the 
Zagorsk motor transport enterprise. Incidentally, we also wrote 
about it in our magazine (AVTOMOBILNYY TRANSPORT, No 2, 1993. 
"`SPAK' Goes Abroad"). Are there many such enterprises in the 
company? 
  [Medvedev] There has been some animation during the past two 
years but I regard this as no more than animation. There are 
individual enterprises where leaders with initiative have been 
engaged in this business, but no more than that. 
  [Yevsyukov] In short, these are individual episodes and not 
an overall trend? 
  [Medvedev] Yes, one can say that roughly. Of course, one 
cannot expect that in the very near future all enterprises may 
take such a path. However, in the European part of Russia, in 
the Far East, and even in the Urals (for example, Chelyabinsk) 
such work is proceeding rather actively. But in many oblasts as 
yet a "stirring-up," as they say, is going on. 
  [Yevsyukov] How do you see the prospects for the development 
of general-use motor transport in 1994? 
  [Medvedev] Unfortunately, I can say nothing about an 
increase 
in the volumes of freight hauls. Here, as I have already said, 
we need to earnestly reorient ourselves to transport dispatching 
so as not to lose our production potential and not to allow a 
reduction of the specialists and workers we employ. 
  Our other task is not to lose the ability to manage the 
sector (upravlyayemost otrasli). This is not only an important 
production factor but also a psychological one. When we talk 
about the ability to manage, then right away we recall 
collegiums, all kinds of meetings, conferences, aktivs, etc. 
However, the fact is that one should not consider the ability to 
manage only from the viewpoint of dressing-downs, reprimands, 
etc. Under present conditions the ability to manage is necessary 
in the interests of realizing the goals both of society as a 
whole and of the company and each of its founders. There is a 
host of such problems which cannot be resolved one by one. Take 
the gathering of the harvest. Society now incurs a great deal of 
losses and waste because of the poor ability to manage motor 
transport in these operations. 
  We intend to work on these questions in the coming year. 
  In the name of the workers of "Rosavtotrans" I would like to 
wish all motorists of Russia and all readers of the magazine a 
happy New Year and to wish them good health, success and 
personal happiness. 
  [Yevsukov] Thank you, Vasiliy Dmitriyevich. The editorial 
staff heartily joins you and on its part sends wishes for health 
and success to all workers of the "Rosavtotrans" company.

<F P=106> [Interview with B. Ufimtsev, deputy chief of the South Urals </F>
Railroad, general director of Yuzhuralzheldorsnab, by A. 
Loginov, GUDOK special correspondent: "In a Ferment of 
Bartering"; Chelyabinsk-Moscow; date not given] 
  [Text] Today, when debts and mutual non-payments, 
amounting to millions and billions of rubles, have become not 
the best sign of the times, a reasonable question arises: just 
how, under these conditions, can one solve the problem of 
material-technical supply for transport as a whole and for its 
individual mainlines? 
  Our correspondent interviewed B. Ufimtsev, deputy chief 
of the South Urals Railroad, general director of 
Yuzhuralzheldorsnab, on this subject 
  [Loginov] Boris Petrovich, in giving a report on supply 
matters at the road's technical-economic council last year, 
judging by the notices in the railroad newspaper, you noted that 
difficulties are arising today, not in obtaining resources, but 
in obtaining the funds to acquire and pay for them. 
  [Ufimtsev] Well here, let us agree, I didn't say anything 
new. Many countries of the world, including the United States 
and Japan, are making wide use of barter deals and mutual debt 
clearing. Indeed, our country practiced this even earlier, in 
the days of centralized supply, except that this was done "at 
the top," whereas now, with the transition to the market, one 
has to do it oneself -- on the scale of the roads, divisions and 
their subdivisions. 
  Remember, the union's MPS [Ministry of Railways] had a 
Material-Technical Supply Main Administration (GUMTO) with the 
chief of the main administration holding the rank of deputy 
minister. Later on, this structure ceased to exist (as did the 
intersectorial Gossnab [State Committee for Material and 
Technical Supply], etc.). As far back as 1990 they began to set 
up a marketing service. At that time I was appointed chief of 
this service and commercial director of the South Urals 
Railroad. True, in those days, the tasks were somewhat 
different: at that time there were not enough resources, and 
therefore they had to be "procured" through additional road 
services, leasing railcars, etc. In a word, this experience has 
come in handy today. 
  A necessary digression. On listening to the tape 
of the interview, in preparation for publication, I could not 
help remembering the economic postulates presented to us in our 
student years: commodity-money-commodity. The classic formula of 
"Das Kapital" by K. Marx, to which we have, it seems, been 
cycled today in our commodity-money bedlam. It is as if there is 
more and more money -- our old wooden stuff and various 
currencies, but everywhere you hear about the shortage of cash, 
of "live" money for clearing accounts. For this reason (and 
other, attendant ones), a real muddle has arisen in the economy. 
Meanwhile, the author of "Das Kapital," in the section about the 
cost of circulation, says: 
  "1. One of the main items of circulation costs is the money 
itself, since it itself has a cost. Money is saved by means of 
credit in a three-fold way: A. For a considerable number of 
transactions, money is not necessary at all." 
  We will not dwell on the last two points in the A, B, C 
triad, although it would be useful for us, and for our economic 
reformers today to know about those points, which were well 
known over a century ago. Let us therefore return to the present 
problems, the solution of which has gone according to the 
Marxist "recommendation" that money is not needed for a 
considerable number of transactions between partners. 
  With the vanishing of the system of centralized allotment of 
funds, unfortunately, no full-valued commodity exchanges that 
would be capable of satisfying supply and demand have so far 
appeared, because of the disparity of prices and all possible 
commercial, tax and other jacked-up demands. Now the railroad 
workers, particularly their supply structures, have realized: 
they cannot survive on their own under these conditions, they 
have to unite. I asked my collocutor about this. 
  [Ufimtsev] The South Urals became a member of the first 
eight-road association created on the network, which included 
the Sverdlovsk (initiator), Kemerovo, Moscow, Northern, Gorkiy, 
Kuybyshev and Volga mainlines. The regions that they serve 
produce many of the things that they need. Let us say, on the 
South Urals -- metal, on the Kuybyshev -- petroleum products, 
the Kemerovo -- coal, etc. Last year our road, through barter 
operations alone, acquired 1.5 billion rubles' [R] worth of 
resources. Moreover, on the basis of contracts with other roads 
and with enterprises of our own region (and not it alone) and by 
reciprocal offset, we acquired R13.7 billion worth of resources. 
This naturally eased the financial situation of the road, whose 
debt to customers was reckoned in tens of billions of rubles. 
After all, you have to pay people wages -- this should be done 
in banknotes. 
  [Loginov] But does it turn out that you also pay them with 
barter? For example, on the Orsk Division, I heard that they are 
"issued" in both motor units and refrigerators, produced 
locally. A friend of mine complained: her husband (true, he does 
not work in transport) had not received his wages for several 
months, but on the other hand, he regularly gets, as a partial 
offset for them... sausage. So it is possible, she says, for 
them to live. 
  "We have this sort of independent market, we have to dodge 
around in various ways," my collocutor smiled. Later on, after I 
visited the Orsk Division, I wondered how the barter wages were 
being accepted, and I heard that things were not all that bad. 
Let us say, that same motor unit and refrigerator cost the 
recipient of the "substitute wage" several thousand rubles less 
(!) than on the trade network, after the price is jacked up in 
various ways. The railroad workers, in obtaining goods for 
mutual offset and settlements (essentially at production cost), 
avoid the money "sticking to" the grasping hands of businessmen, 
and sell the goods cheaper. 
  I recently read, in the newspaper SELSKAYA ZHIZN, an item 
with the sensational heading, "Fertilizer from... a Locomotive." 
Its topic is the fact that many chemical enterprises in the 
region of the Gorkiy Railroad owe it a tidy sum for transport. 
The railroad workers, in settlement, began to take the debts in 
fertilizers, and, in order to have "live money," to sell them to 
the local kolkhozes, sovkhozes and joint-stock companies. In 
all, they concluded contracts for the supply of 90,000 tonnes of 
nitrogen fertilizers. These fertilizers cost the farmers 15-20 
percent less. 
  The Nizhegorod Oblast administration contributed its bit to 
this transaction, when it allotted the peasants R3 billion from 
its budget to buy fertilizer, and another R1.5 billion to the 
Nizhegorodselkhozkhimiya Joint-Stock Company. This means that 
the railroad workers had no particular problem in selling the 
fertilizer. Not to mention the fact that they did not fail to 
transfer some of it to their own subsidiary farms. 
  In short, the market has begun to act according to its own 
particular laws. Zheldorsnab is no weaker because of this, but 
on the contrary --has become one of the leading services on the 
railroads. It fulfills, on the one hand, its own basic function 
-- supply, self-provision of resources for the road, without 
trusting in, as it used to, help and allotments from above (MPS, 
Gossnab, etc.). On the other hand -- it carries out clearing 
accounts and the sale of excess resources. Here there is simply 
an interweaving of supply (in the traditional meaning) and 
commerce. 
  I note: my chat with the general director of 
Yuzhuralzheldorsnab differed somewhat from an ordinary 
interview, and Boris Petrovich Ufimtsev differed from the class 
of directors who evade the dry presentation of facts and 
figures. This is just the result of what has been done, but how 
can more be achieved, how can tomorrow's result be predicted and 
planned (!) under the conditions of the market leaps? When 
industrial production and transport continue to drop, and prices 
to rise. When today's millions and billions are no match for 
tomorrow's. All the same, there is always a starting point -- 
the beginning from which we can and must begin again. 
  Last year, he reflects, his service, as has already been 
noted, "obtained" resources amounting to a little over 
one-and-a-half dozen billion rubles. That's quite a good deal. 
The contents of the road's financial "purse" would not have made 
it possible (without barter) to allot such funds. 
  He well knows, though, that the mainline's needs are much 
greater. And they must be satisfied. The divisions and their 
subdivisions were given the assignment of weighing everything at 
the sites: the total sum of requests for resources in 1994 was 
about R78 billion. It is unrealistic to count on funds like this 
being found in the road's cashbox. It was therefore proposed to 
that same technical-economic council for the railroad that 60 
percent of the material resources be acquired through barter 
with other railroads. Part of them would go for the needs of our 
railroad, and part for barter and sale.... 
  This is the basis for planning -- not up-in-the-air 
planning, 
but real planning, albeit with market "nuances".... "Last year," 
said B.P. Ufimtsev, "because of the shortage of rails, ties and 
other things, we could not cope with the plan for capital repair 
of the line. Now we must fill in the gaps. How? We have 
concluded a contract with the metallurgists of the Urals: they 
will pay for future transport with metal, and we will send R6 
billion worth of it to Novokuznetsk, and we will get rails from 
there." 
  In this way, the railroad workers of the South Urals 
Railroad 
and their partners by association will appear in several 
hypostases: transporters, buyers -- employers, consignees.... 
Naturally, since I am a journalist, a number of questions 
occurred to me. 
  [Loginov] Today the price of metal is one thing, tomorrow -- 
it will leap.... 
  [Ufimtsev] Six billion holds good as the starting price at 
the moment of concluding the deal, and indexing proceeds at the 
moment a certain batch of metal or other materials is shipped. 
  [Loginov] But the transport tariffs will also leap -- won't 
they "eat up" the rails, ties, and the rest? 
  [Ufimtsev] You can't avoid this, the rise in tariffs is 
caused by the rise in prices for energy resources and for 
everything that transport needs. It cannot be otherwise. But 
what goes for the railroad's needs is supplied at favorable 
rates. 
  [Loginov] Another thing: the huge products list of supplies 
(about 40,000 item descriptions) and the price leaps -- all this 
requires rapid, if not instantaneous reaction. How can you 
succeed in managing it, in handling it? After all, judging by 
what you have said, your staff is comparatively small. 
  [Ufimtsev] We have begun to form a system. By decision of 
the 
technical-economic council, the road's IVTs [computer 
information center] is gathering data on the goods being 
produced in the region. With this data bank in the computer 
memory (it can be lost in paper technology), special computer 
programs can be worked out which make it possible to obtain the 
necessary information quickly and to make corrections. This is 
not only on the scale of the South Urals Railroad administration 
and the road association administration, but also at the sites 
-- on the divisions and subdivisions of the mainlines. Having 
created this computer information network, we can go to a new 
level of material-technical supply control. 
  [Loginov] Will this approach make it possible to get out of 
the present market chaos? 
  [Ufimtsev] No doubt about it. It is naive to suppose that 
the 
wild, uncontrolled market can put everything in its place by 
itself. The civilized market is -- and I know how it is 
organized -- a very strict economy, planned development and 
discipline in the mutual relations of the partners. These 
components will not permit the wild burst of non-payments which 
has reached catastrophic proportions in our country. There is no 
place for chaos, when 98 percent of the partners are working 
according to a contract system. This is the plan, clear-cut and 
mutually coordinated, and deviations from it are severely 
punished, according to the terms of the contract. Only two 
percent is so-called economic freedom. The rest is the study of 
supply and demand, and marketing. Everything is counted out and 
weighed on the scales of the economy. Not as it is in our 
country -- on the off-chance, by grabbing, by prodding.... 
  [Loginov] Boris Petrovich, before I talked to you, I heard a 
flattering reference to the fact that the railroad workers, 
apparently from your department, were organizing a trade fair of 
Chinese commodities in Chelyabinsk. Is this also part of the 
commercial work? 
  [Ufimtsev] This is somewhat different. Actually, in addition 
to supply, we are also engaging in foreign economic activity. We 
have a contract of intent, documents for the development of 
joint ventures, etc. In this case, however, the organized sale 
of Chinese goods, obtained in barter for our surplus, is the 
contribution of the Chelyabinsk Division of the road. 
  This is a topic for a separate conversation. We go out on 
the 
foreign market when we do not find anything that we have "at 
home." Or we find it, but -- it is not as good.... For example, 
the special "Gudok" work clothing for engineers -- jacket and 
trousers. We buy them at a plant in St. Petersburg. But the 
Chinese suggested that they make a consignment of this clothing: 
with natural fur (we use synthetic), made more accurately, and 
for a cheaper price. The engineers prefer the Chinese "Gudok" -- 
a market is a market. 
  [Loginov] As far as I know, we are stumbling on the market 
in 
our relations with our near abroad, particularly with Kazakhstan. 
  [Ufimtsev] Paradoxical as it may seem. After all, until 
quite 
recently we had no border barriers: part of the Orenburg 
Division was wedged into Kazakhstan, and vice-versa -- the West 
Kazakhstan Railroad was in Orenburg Oblast. Indeed, even now the 
Petropavlovsk Division is included in the South Urals Railroad, 
so as not to break up the Central Siberian mainline. For that 
reason we sometimes cannot provide "our" division with spare 
parts, because of customs and other barriers, even though their 
delivery belongs in the category of technically necessary, 
duty-free transport. There is an intergovernment statute on this 
score, but just imagine -- we still stumble. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  As if "by order," a telephone conversation comes to my mind. 
It reflects one of the paradoxes of our time.... Railcars loaded 
with edible salt, extracted at Sol-Iletsk, which is in Orenburg 
Oblast, arrived for processing and shipment to consignees at the 
nearby Iletsk Station of the West Kazakhstan Railroad. But they 
held them up here, demanding that customs duty be paid. Ufimtsev 
had to explain in simple terms that this was transport necessary 
for technical reasons, specified by so-and-so.... 
  After all, this is the salt, the whole point of our lack of 
coordination and woes.

<F P=106> [Conference statements by First Deputy Minister of Railways </F>
O.A. Moshenko, reported by N. Davydov: "Wages at the Right Time"] 
  [Text] The continuing recession in transport services 
and the inoperative payment mechanism are not giving railroad 
workers any hope for a peaceful life. Despite the fact that 
continuous service is being provided for freight and passengers, 
the sector's economic situation is very disturbing. As First 
Deputy Minister O.A. Moshenko emphasized in opening a recent 
selector conference, roughly one-third of the wages for March 
still had not been financed by 12 May, although it is already 
time to pay the wages for April. 
  We have written repeatedly about the reasons for this. The 
problem of problems is the shortage of "ready" money in the 
railroads' income accounts because of their clients' insolvency. 
It has already become the rule that at best, half of the funds 
earned are in money, and the remainder are in reciprocal 
credits, the output of debtor enterprises, and so forth. And in 
order to pay all the wages for March and half of April, let us 
say, by the end of May, it is necessary to have no less than 924 
billion rubles [R], or 57 percent of all receipts from 
transportation services, in the accounts. 
  But if it is taken into account that the railroads received 
less than 42 percent of their planned earnings in cash in April, 
it becomes clear how difficult it will be to resolve the 
problem. Without painstaking work every day to reduce the debt 
owed to the railroads, to reduce expenses and increase incomes, 
to bring maintenance personnel into conformity with the volume 
of transportation, and to bring down the costs from loads that 
are not safeguarded and fines for delays in freight deliveries, 
and so forth, it will be difficult to count on positive results. 
  But after all, we have to finance not only the wage fund for 
the railroads and the plants, but manage the funds deducted for 
social needs (social insurance, the pension fund, medical 
insurance, and other items--39 percent altogether) and taxes for 
the state budget. 
  The situation is aggravated because a number of railroads 
have permitted an unjustified wage increase, so to speak, over 
the amount granted by the Wage Agreement. The increasing 
expenses for these purposes have been made a catalyst to a 
certain extent for delaying the periods for settlement with 
labor collectives. The wage fund was exceeded by more than R14 
billion in the first quarter (in relation to December 1993) on 
the October and Sverdlovsk railroads. The overexpenditure was 
half of this but still quite substantial on the West Siberian 
and Far Eastern railroads. As we see, the rates exceed the ones 
planned. 
  The MPS [Ministry of Railways] and the trade union central 
committee have been forced to make adjustments, since the faster 
indexing of wages is making the task of eliminating the payments 
debt even more difficult. Especially as the right to warning 
indexation was stipulated by the Wage Agreement only for the 
first quarter, but managers of the Gorkiy, Kemerovo, Sverdlovsk, 
and certain other railroads raised wages by 12 to 17 percent in 
April. Although the predicted increase in consumer prices (in 
conformity with which indexing should be conducted in the second 
quarter) was no more than 10 percent and actually was less than 
9 percent. 
  All this has had a negative effect on attempts to completely 
eliminate the indebtedness for wages, and only the Moscow and 
Kaliningrad railroads are paying them on time at present. This 
is a serious problem for nearly all the other railroads. Which 
has been confirmed by statements made by the mainlines' 
managers, in fact. Nevertheless, the railroads have been 
supporting the strategic line proposed by the ministry--to bring 
the schedule for wage payments back to normal by Railroad 
Workers' Day. 
  In short, the essence of the strategy is as follows. The 
wages for March should be paid in full before 20 May, the April 
wages should be paid by 15 June, the wages for May should be 
paid by 5 July, and the wages for June should be paid by 30 
July. So with June's wages, we begin a normal routine for 
payment. That is, over a period of 2 and a half months, we have 
to collect R3.3 trillion in money from clients; this will be 
48.8 percent of the earnings planned for this period. The task 
is very difficult, but as discussion has shown, it can be 
accomplished. 
  It was stressed in particular that the sum designated is 
adequate under the condition that not 1 ruble will go toward 
other needs. Realistically this cannot be achieved, and for this 
reason, the task set is to obtain no less than 60 percent of the 
earnings in money. In addition, to more fully utilize other 
sources to obtain money. 
  First of all, to sell the products received in payment for 
debts more expeditiously. This can yield about R100 billion 
every month. 
  Secondly, through other proceeds (local incomes, fines, 
various services, and so forth), the monthly increment may 
amount to no less than R80 billion. 
  And finally, the ministry has urged a more active effort to 
recover debts from so-called other clients. In the system as a 
whole, they now owe R1.77 trillion. This is a difficult task, 
but transport cannot continue to operate in debt. As O.A. 
Moshenko emphasized, the credits, debts, and 
earnings--everything should be accounted for specifically now. 
Each railroad manager should have a detailed plan on the table 
and daily supervision is essential to carry it out. 
  Participants in the conference came to the conclusion that 
in 
the system as a whole, the amount of "ready" money in the 
railroads' income accounts must be increased by 6 percent in 
order to finance wages in conformity with the schedule adopted. 
But this is an average. The Sakhalin, Transbaykal, and 
Baykal-Amur railroads must have 65 to 75 percent more of such 
earnings. Collectives of the West Siberian, Krasnoyarsk, East 
Siberian, Far Eastern, and Kuybyshev railroads will also have to 
make a serious effort to work this out. 
  We cannot fail to mention that the situation in the plants 
is 
even worse than in transport service itself. Of course, the sums 
needed here are less, but it is no easier for workers at the 
enterprises. But in the figure cited above--R3.3 trillion--funds 
have also been provided to pay the wages of workers at the 
ministry's plants. Serious claims have been made against the 
managers of loading railroads who sometimes "forget" about their 
financial obligations with respect to the transit railroads. And 
there is a special question--recovery of debts from the railroad 
administrations of the CIS countries, which are already over 
R400 billion. 
  Summing up the discussion, the first deputy minister called 
upon the railroad managers to show that they are more demanding 
toward their clients and not to bypass nontraditional incomes 
which are "beckoning" directly to railroad workers. But the main 
objective is to look for and find uncommon means of increasing 
incomes and reducing expenses.

<F P=106> [Article by Myroslav Levytskyy under the rubric "Political </F>
Commentary": "Is Rukh Ridding Itself of Opposition within Its 
Ranks? The Ukrainian Republican Party Is Analyzing the 
Situation... The Leftists Are Making a Push To Compete in the 
Presidential Election!"] 
  [Text] A number of political events took place in the 
capital of Ukraine on the 16th and 17th April of this year. 
Unquestionably, the event that attracted the most attention was 
the second phase of the Fifth All-Ukrainian Rukh-Party Congress. 
Of the 1,200 delegates, 826 took part in the work of the 
congress. The main topic at the congress was a discussion of the 
results of the parliamentary elections. In his programmatic 
speech on the results and lessons of the parliamentary 
elections, the leader of Rukh stressed that Rukh won the 
elections despite the fact that only some seven percent of its 
candidates won seats. He admitted that this number was lower 
than anticipated, but blamed the conservative nature of the law, 
the actions of governing structures, irregularities in the 
counting of votes, and the ambitions of Rukh's partners in the 
democratic camp for the outcome. Levko Lukyanenko and the 
democratic Ukraine bloc he heads were the targets of especially 
harsh criticism in V. Chornovil's speech and in the speeches of 
many of his supporters. There were the customary harsh attacks 
on the Ukrainian Republican Party [URP]. The second target of 
criticism was the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN]. 
  This criticism often went beyond the bounds of propriety. 
People's Deputy of Ukraine Bohdan Boyko, the Ternopil Oblast 
chairman of Rukh, is particularly adept at this kind of attack. 
The language of his speech was more reminiscent of the old 
meeting bully than that of a civilized parliamentarian. These 
days, fewer people by far are impressed by the antilogical 
bullying that was customary at our meetings. In contrast to 
earlier years, populism no longer elicits ovations. The accents 
are slowly changing. Much more likely to be applauded are 
attempts to assess what has been accomplished and one's place in 
the scheme of things. 
  Serhiy Odarych, a member of the Rukh Leadership, and 
People's 
Deputy of Ukraine Yevhen Zhovtyak from Kiev Oblast tried to do 
just that. Zhovtyak, in particular, underscored the need to rise 
above party egotism because the good of Ukraine must come before 
the party. He said that for Rukh, which aspires to be the leader 
of the people, winning seven percent of the seats in parliament 
is not a victory but a crushing defeat. The blame for this does 
not lie with the government, the URP, or the KUN, but with the 
party's style and system of work. In the opinion of the speaker, 
the party apparatus needs to be revitalized. The personal 
ambitions of Rukh's leaders at the rayon level were another 
reason for the party's defeat. Instead of searching out 
exceptional individuals from the democratic camp as a whole, 
automatic support was given to the rayon leaders. 
  Serhiy Odarych is also inclined to regard the elections as a 
defeat. Only five of the 21 oblast chairmen won seats. For our 
part, we should add that most of Rukh's elected deputies are 
people who came into parliament in 1990. Serhiy Odarych pointed 
out a number of things that the party leadership had failed to 
do, and he urged Rukh to take the initiative in forming an 
alliance of national-democratic forces to create a single 
democratic organization. 
  Following these two fundamentally divergent speeches, V. 
Chornovil ordered that a special, closed meeting of the Small 
Council of Rukh be convened. 
  Meanwhile, the congress returned to its normal course of 
analyzing the election results and denying the notion of a 
defeat. A statement was adopted in which the reasons for the 
results of the election were analyzed. The results were deemed 
satisfactory. Criticism was levelled against the Ukraine 
Alliance. Rukh's regional organizations were instructed to begin 
preparations for elections to the local councils and the 
leadership of Rukh to begin preparing for the additional 
parliamentary elections, to initiate the creation of a bloc of 
democratic forces within the democratic corps of deputies, and 
to hold a meeting of the representatives of the 
national-democratic forces. 
  But why not rely on already existing structures -- the 
Congress of National-Democratic Forces [KNDS] and the Ukraine 
Democratic Alliance? Apparently the stereotype of support for 
the mythical "party of power" poses an obstacle. There is also 
another reason, which I will discuss later. 
  A meeting of parties and organizations that comprise the 
Ukraine Democratic Alliance was held on 14 April. This meeting 
was also attended by Leonid (Les) Tanyuk, a member of the 
Central Leadership of Rukh. The meeting resolved to extend its 
participants' best wishes to the Rukh congress and to take the 
initiative in calling for expanded cooperation. This mission was 
assigned to Levko Lukyanenko. 
  To everybody's astonishment, the chairman of the Ukraine 
Democratic Alliance was not among the guests who spoke at the 
[Rukh] congress. In answer to my question, V. Chornovil replied 
that he did not know why Lukyanenko had not appeared. 
Invitations had supposedly been sent to everybody. It turns out 
that some were "forgotten." Lukyanenko's was one of these. This 
way the idea concerning the need to unify the [country's] 
democratic forces can be represented as coming from one side 
only. However, one can see with the naked eye that all of this 
is merely a subtle ploy in the struggle for absolute leadership. 
  How then is this unity to be achieved? This question arises 
at all the crossroads of the political process. What we are 
seeing today is a very complex phenomenon -- the further along 
we move in the process of establishing a multiparty system, the 
more Bolshevism we encounter. 
  Vyacheslav Chornovil no longer denies that Rukh is a party. 
It was precisely for the purpose of establishing this status and 
strengthening organizational discipline that a number of changes 
were made in Rukh's charter. In the Rukh leader's view, the 
election results would have been much more modest had they not 
decided in March of 1992 to rebuild Rukh structurally and 
conceptually into a party. 
  The second day of the Rukh congress was devoted to issues 
pertaining to changing the charter and forming the leadership. 
  The election of the new leadership of Rukh provoked a great 
deal of emotion. V. Chornovil, whose powers as chairman were 
extended by the congress back in December 1993, proposed 
electing the leadership by voting for a full slate of nominees. 
He nominated Oles Lavrynovych for the office of deputy chairman 
of Rukh. Mykhaylo Boychyshyn was proposed for another of the 
deputy chairman slots and for head of the secretariat. As his 
other two deputies, V. Chornovil chose Olena Bondarenko, a 
journalist from Luhansk, and Professor Robert Kartashov, a 
Russian. 
  The congress participants demanded that the party leaders be 
voted for individually and not as a full slate. For some reason, 
this greatly angered the leader of Rukh, who argued that he had 
to work with these people. The quarrel about the way in which 
the vote should be held lasted much longer than the voting for 
individual candidates. It is difficult to explain this 
resentment of a dissenting position in light of the fact that at 
the stage of the formation of the national-democratic forces, V. 
Chornovil constantly used the tactic of taking an opposite and 
separate stand. Moreover, as the congress participants elected 
the nominated individuals without any problems. 
  Passions really flared in the process of forming the Central 
Leadership. Once again, a list of candidates was proposed. Those 
present expressed their surprise that it did not include 
Professor Chernyak and the lawyer Holovatyy. The chairman of 
Rukh explained that S. Holovatyy had not taken part in the work 
of the Central Leadership since last year and that Professor 
Chernyak had chosen to run in the elections in a district that 
had not been approved by the leadership. 
  Holovatyy, a member of the Central Leadership of Rukh for 
whom V. Chornovil had fought a bitter battle at the Fourth 
All-Ukrainian Congress, took part in the Fifth Congress as a 
guest. He expressed his resentment on this account in his 
speech. He rejected all accusations that he had failed to do his 
job in the Central Leadership and, instead, called the work of 
the Rukh leadership immoral. 
  Inasmuch as all this results from internal animosities, I 
have no desire to enter into the real gist of this conflict, but 
it was precisely of immorality that the congress delegates 
accused S. Holovatyy. V. Chervoniy, the chairman of the Rivne 
organization of Rukh, added oil to the fire in the debate 
surrounding the president of the Ukrainian Legal Foundation by 
bringing up S. Holovatyy's writings against the Kiev 
Patriarchate. This ultimately tipped the scales. With 273 votes 
cast against him, S. Holovatyy did not make it into the Central 
Leadership. An experienced strategist, V. Chornovil immediately 
announced that he was prepared to forgive Holovatyy's apostasy 
if the latter promised to submission inside the Rukh faction. 
But submissiveness and S. Holovatyy are two incompatible 
concepts. 
  Also missing from the list of individuals elected to the 
Central Leadership was S. Holovatyy's colleague, Valeriy 
Ivasyuk, on whose behalf V. Chornovil also waged a passionate 
battle in 1992. 
  Under pressure from the delegates, Professor Chernyak was 
included in the list of members of the Central Leadership of 
Rukh, but he was elected only conditionally. 
  As I followed the progress of the congress, it struck me 
that 
the much publicized leader of the opposition is skillfully 
ridding himself of opposition in his own party. Can it be that 
the opposition fears opposition? That is how I posed the issue 
at the press conference. V. Chornovil stated that this was my 
own subjective understanding of the situation. The incident 
involving Holovatyy was not grounds for such a conclusion. 
  Perhaps, but I see this as a much broader problem that goes 
beyond a simple party incident. After analyzing all the nuances 
of Holovatyy's ouster and taking into consideration his 
personality, I believe that this step will have a negative 
effect on the process of establishing the Ukrainian multiparty 
system. Holovatyy will set about ruthlessly discrediting V. 
Chornovil as a politician at all levels, and this will lead to a 
conflict of generations that will not be confined to the bosom 
of the Rukh party. The beginnings of such a conflict were 
evident at the Rukh forum. As a result, I fully agree with the 
warnings expressed by Yuriy Badzyo in his thoughts against the 
current, "Let Us Not Commit Suicide in Vain!" 
  Just as at the Rukh congress, passions ran high at the 
meeting of the URP leadership held on 16 April. However, these 
passions were aimed in a different direction. Levko Lukyanenko, 
the chairman of the Ukraine Democratic Alliance and honorary 
head of the URP, argued in favor of opposing the party of power. 
Other URP politicians and activists tried to analyze the 
situation. Questions were posed: where did they fail and why, 
with whom did they fail to agree and why? They primarily blamed 
themselves. The chairman of the URP stressed that the party 
cannot be a serious entity if it follows the tide rather than 
forming the political climate. Owing to objective and subjective 
circumstances, the URP was unable to create the climate needed 
to win, and therefore only seven percent of the candidates it 
fielded won seats in parliament. 
  The leadership of the URP approached with restraint the idea 
of unifying political forces that had been expressed at the Rukh 
forum. Mykhaylo Horyn believes that the times are such that 
there is a real need for an alliance of ideologically close 
political structures. However, if there is a continued attempt 
to substitute Bolshevik-style annexation for unification, this 
issue will remain deadlocked. 
  He also rejected the thesis posed by V. Chornovil at the 
Rukh 
congress that there can be no room for many kindred political 
forces in the same political niche. In M. Horyn's opinion, the 
niche is so large and there is so much work to be done that it 
is wrong to take this stand. 
  The URP came up with the initiative to create a coalition of 
democratically oriented parties whose factions are represented 
in parliament. In addition to political parties, the coalition 
can include public organizations that are also represented in 
parliament. The goal of the coalition is to unite the patriotic 
forces in parliament so that they can coordinate their 
activities in lawmaking, statebuilding, forming the government, 
and passing the most important decisions affecting the state. 
The head of the coalition will be put forward for the post of 
prime minister. 
  This initiative largely corresponds to that put forward by 
UKRAYINSKE SLOVO and the Olzhych Fund to create an anti-Kuchma 
front. It is onsonant with many of the voices heard at the Fifth 
All-Ukrainian Congress of Rukh. 
  Apparently the leadership of Rukh views this issue 
differently. V. Chornovil is convinced that all the democratic 
forces, with the exception of Rukh, lost the elections and 
therefore the individual deputies will be forced to place 
themselves under his wing. 
  Apart from the factor of pure ambition -- the monopoly on 
patriotism --which causes serious concern among nationally 
conscious journalists, this serves as dynamite for 
confrontation. Serhiy Holovatyy has already announced that he 
will form a faction parallel to Chornovil's. 
  One of today's key issues is the presidential election set 
for 26 June. This matter was widely discussed both at the Rukh 
congress and among the leaders of the URP. Participants in both 
events urged that their parties not take part in this 
undertaking. As a last resort, they will support an acceptable 
candidate for the office of president. At the same time, they 
stressed that the greatest threat to Ukraine is the 
Kuchma-Hrynyov Interregional Reform Bloc, which speculates on 
pro-Russian sentiments and proclaims slogans that do not serve 
the national interests of Ukraine. It is therefore essential to 
concentrate all efforts on neutralizing this bloc. This struggle 
will prove less effective, because the corps of directors are 
more flexible than the orthodox Reds. 
  It is no secret that Kuchma is the leading claimant to the 
presidential chair. As he announced at his press conference, he 
will try to win over even the rightist radicals (Khmara and the 
Ukrainian National Self-Defense Force [UNSO]) if their economic 
concepts coincide. In addition to Kuchma, O. Moroz, the leader 
of the Socialists, is also a candidate for the office. As the 
Central Election Commission has reported, the intention to put 
forward candidates has been announced by the Communists, the 
Civic Congress of Ukraine [GKU], the Labor Congress, the 
Christian-Democratic Party of Ukraine [KhDPU], and the DSU 
[State Independence of Ukraine]. Thus, only the vociferous 
radical structures are announcing their intention to join in the 
presidential race. However, in view of the fact that 6 May is 
the deadline for collecting signatures, it is difficult to 
imagine that many candidates will manage to collect the 
necessary number of signatures in time. It is quite possible 
that the presidential epic may end with the collection of 
signatures. Then the date of the election will automatically be 
postponed. For some reason, Ivan Plyushch, the speaker of the 
old parliament, takes an overly calm and optimistic approach to 
this. 
  Ukraine could be considered to have gained if only two 
candidates remain on the ballot, because this would mean a 
contest to the end. But this would be a very costly game. It may 
well be that the leftists want to exhaust Ukraine with this game 
and thus produce tension and increase regional polarization. 
After all, none of them has a chance to win the presidential 
chair at this time. Yet each of them can serve as Ukraine's 
"Trojan horse." 
  Given the situation, the desire of the radicals from the DSU 
to play at the presidency in the select company of the leftist 
radicals and the chauvinists from the GKU is a complete puzzle!

<F P=106> [Article by Olha Zhukovska, candidate in juridical science: </F>
"Why Are There So Many Vacant Places in the Hall?"] 
  [Text] The situation that has developed as a result of the 
elections for the people's deputies of Ukraine is deeply 
worrying. The 112 vacant places after the runoff election are a 
clear sign of the imperfect nature of the Law of Ukraine, "On 
the Election of People's Deputies of Ukraine." 
  The law is supposed to reflect the needs of real life. In 
the 
given case, the nature of the law, detached from contemporary 
realities, became the reason for the delays in the elections. 
  Moreover, it is noteworthy that a rule which was not 
previously a feature of the electoral law of Ukraine got in the 
way of the elections having a normal result. This rule was 
article 46 of the Law, by which the establishment of the results 
of the election in the runoff election is carried out in the 
order established by article 43 of the same law, which in its 
turn provides that, "a candidate for deputy is considered 
elected, that gets in the election more than half of the votes 
of the voters who took part in the elections, but not less than 
25 percent of the number of voters on the list of voters of the 
given district." 
  This rule, with its contents, is intended to eliminate 
situations in which the opinion of an insignificant number of 
voters leads accidently to the election, as people's deputy, of 
a person who had been able to get a relative majority, through 
the scattering of votes over a large number of registered 
candidates for deputy. 
  As for the runoff elections, this rule works in exactly the 
opposite direction. 
  The views of a certain percentage of voters, who do not 
share 
the convictions of any candidate, lead to the situation in which 
none of the candidates for deputy gets the necessary number of 
votes. Unfortunately, this happened in many districts. 
  So, despite the fundamental idea of democratic elections, 
according to which the results of elections are supposed to 
reflect the will of the real majority of voters, the rule of 
article 46 of the Law of Ukraine "On the Election of People's 
Deputies of Ukraine," led to the directly opposite outcome: the 
results of the elections were actually decided by an absolute 
minority of voters, that was also a relative minority with 
respect to those who supported both candidates. 
  In this way, the principle was violated which is included in 
paragraph three of article one of the law of Ukraine, "On the 
Election of People's Deputies of Ukraine"--"The basic principles 
and bases of the elections of People's Deputies of Ukraine," 
according to which "the elections are carried out in 450 single 
mandate electoral districts on the basis of an absolute 
majority." 
  The special rule of paragraph two of article 46 of the Law 
does not ensure that the principle in article one of the same 
law will be achieved. But according to one of the axiomatic 
bases of the general theory of the state and law, with respect 
to the interrelationships of the juridical force of the rules of 
law of different types, the rules-principles have a greater 
weight than special rules, when the latter contradict the former. 
  Moreover, this result contradicts the basis established by 
paragraph three of article two of the Law, according to which, 
"any direct or indirect limitations concerning the electoral 
rights of the citizens of Ukraine which depend on their 
political convictions ... not provided by this Law, are 
forbidden." (Since in fact, if both candidates that get to the 
runoff election belong to the right wing (or the reverse), then 
the participation in the elections of 4-5 percent of the voters 
with other convictions would have to lead (and actually led) to 
the candidates being deprived of the subjective right to be 
elected, provided by article two of the Law, as something that 
is not restricted by political convictions.) Here there is a 
contradiction between the rule-principle and the special rule. 
  Such conclusions are harmful in themselves. But let us try 
to 
foresee a further turn of events: clearly, two rounds of voting 
have indicated a more or less exact "distribution of forces" in 
the electoral districts. There is no basis to expect any sort of 
"explosion" of activity by the voters at the start of the summer 
as well, when the runoff elections are supposed to take place. 
Under these conditions, the runoffs this time will also not 
provide really elected deputies, or what is more probable, 
generally will not take place. 
  However, a large amount of money will be vainly spent 
carrying them out, which could be directed to social assistance 
for the population. 
  What is the legal way out of this situation? I think that it 
is worth turning to the corresponding rule of the Law of the 
Ukrainian SSR, "On the Elections of the People's Deputies of the 
Ukrainian SSR" (article 54), according to which, in cases of 
runoff elections, the candidate for people's deputy is 
considered to be elected, who received in the runoff election 
the greatest number of votes of the voters who took part in the 
election. The introduction of corresponding changes to the rules 
of article 46 of the Law of Ukraine, "On the Election of 
People's Deputies of Ukraine," would be justified for many 
reasons. Analyzing the situation which developed after the 
elections of 27 March and 10 April, I turned to the transcripts 
of the session of the Supreme Council of Ukraine at which the 
text of article 46 of this Law was discussed and confirmed. 
  All who spoke proposed to introduce a rule to the Law, which 
would not only simplify the elections, but would make it 
possible to eliminate runoff elections. But as became known 
after 10 April, the established goal of simplifying the 
elections was placed, by the deputies themselves, in unrealistic 
frameworks. 
  Here it is also necessary to emphasize that the 
corresponding 
role of article 43 (to which article 46 refers) does not 
reflect, in actuality, the position of the deputies. In the 
course of the discussion of this article, there were two 
pressing and disputed points: the number of people who had to 
come to the elections, and a numerically adequate threshold of 
votes, for the candidates to be elected. 
  In the first, the point of view won concerning the need for 
a 
minimal number of persons on the list of voters, that is equal 
to 50 plus one. As for the second, actually the objections do 
not come with respect to the adequacy of 25 percent of the 
number of persons on the list of voters, for the election of a 
candidate; the objections come only with respect to the 
principle of an absolute majority of votes, and in place a 
relative majority was proposed, to make the process of the 
elections easier. 
  In the voting, the question was put in such a way that there 
could not be any sort of majority of votes. This is the 
transcript of session 32, 18 November 1993 (Bulletin no. 32, p. 
18). Presiding: "All this is clear. Let us find a compromise. 
This compromise will lead to elections having taken place only 
when 50 percent of the voters on the list come. But for there to 
be fewer runoff elections, a rule of 25 percent from the general 
list has to be introduced. This rule will decrease the number of 
runoff elections, and will indicate the victor in the voting 
more quickly. Right? Can all come together on such a position? 
  "Vorobyov speaks correctly--a relative majority, but not 
less 
than 25 percent of the voters on the lists. 
  "So, I ask you to vote for article 46 with the corrections 
we 
have made. To point three--the participation of 50 percent of 
the number of voters, and in point four--as in the version of 
the commission, that is--not less than 25 percent of the number 
of voters on the lists. 
  "I ask you to vote for this version." 
  In this way, the deputies actually while passing the law 
were 
supposed to think that they were voting for conditions of 
election, in which for the election of a deputy, it was enough 
for him to get the votes of 25 percent of the number of voters, 
on the list, without any sort of numeric limitations. 
  And the number 50 plus one applied to the condition for 
indication of elections as being effective. 
  So the text of the rule in article 43, and, correspondingly, 
of article 46, which refers back to the former, clearly does not 
correspond to the will of the deputies. Perhaps we have before 
us a typical technical mistake in combination with 
misunderstanding. There is all the more reason to correct it, at 
least concerning runoff elections, in order to complete in a 
constructive way the process of forming the parliament. As 
concerns the runoff elections themselves, the above mentioned 
"noble goals" of creating conditions for an effective parliament 
require, for bringing them into being, quite different concrete 
steps. 
  Will making the changes being discussed to the Law of 
Ukraine, "On the Election of People's Deputies" have any 
signficant negative aspects? I do not think so. 
  Usually, as a general rule, a law ought to be stable. But 
this principle exists first of all to ensure that the rules, by 
which laws are implemented, are not changed with insufficient 
grounds in the direction of limiting those laws (or total 
abolition). From this, it is considered unacceptable in the 
theory of the state and of law, to change or implement rules of 
reverse effect, which lay down obligations, establish 
limitations on laws, or prohibitions, and so on. 
  But in this case, it concerns the direct opposite: for a 
change of rules in the direction of expanding the legal bases 
for implementing laws and for implementing the opposing force to 
these changes, that expand the boundaries for gaining the right 
to be elected. 
  This concerns procedures. As for the legal content of the 
proposed changes, they, unquestionably, would correspond to the 
general goal of democratic elections--to form a parliament by 
democratic means; and to the rules-principles given above, of 
the Law of Ukraine, "On the Election of People's Deputies of 
Ukraine." 
  Moreover, the social purposefulness of the corresponding 
changes is apparent; it makes it possible to form an outstanding 
parliament, and saves money and effort which otherwise would 
have to be spent on carrying out runoff elections without 
results. 
  The introduction of such changes would correspond by content 
not only with the previous experience of our state, but of 
democratic foreign states. 
  In France from 1958 to 1985, there was a majoritarian 
system, 
so that for someone to be elected a member of parliament, a 
candiate in the first round had to get a complete majority of 
votes, but in the second it was enough to get a relative 
majority. 
  So I think it is worthwhile to make changes to article 46 of 
the Law of Ukraine, "On the Election of People's Deputies of 
Ukraine," with paragraph two in its final version: "The 
candidate for deputy will be considered elected, that got during 
the runoff election the majority of votes of the voters that 
took part in the voting for another candidate," and to expand 
the effect of these changes to legal relations which arose 
before they were accepted.

"Such a Meager Selection..."] 
  [Text] Like it or not, that is the conclusion one 
reaches when analyzing the list of aspirants nominated as 
candidates for president of Ukraine. The first threesome of 
probable victors consists of Leonid Kravchuk, Ivan Plyushch, and 
Leonid Kuchma. Of course, a fascinating spectacle awaits us--the 
"bear fight under the rug" promise to be super-entertaining, 
better than the Western preelection shows. Indeed, only the 
results are known beforehand--no matter how you shuffle our far 
from saintly threesome, things will not be improved. Each of 
them has made a worthy contribution over the past two years or 
so to "getting the government mired down in communist dogma and 
corruption, while the words 'Ukrainization' and 'Ukraine' 
resound as synonyms for economic impoverishment, collapse, and 
resistance to reforms." But let us take a closer look at their 
prospects. 
<H5>  Leonid Kravchuk </H5>
  It would seem his political star has faded. Though as 
recently as January his ratings were high. His base--the old 
Communist Party nomenklatura, established structures in the 
localities, the "party of power"--seemed to be powerful and 
unshakeable. But on the very eve of activity of the Supreme 
Council, "at the signal" as chessplayers say, Ivan Plyushch 
somewhat unexpectedly outplayed that skillful grand master of 
political intrigue, Leonid Kravchuk, confronting him not only 
with the prospect of the presidential elections, but with the 
dismantling of the organs of executive authority. 
  Like last year, this year has not been most successful for 
the current president. Especially during the spring, in April. 
According to all assessments, the elections to the parliament 
did not have to be held. A great deal of effort was expended to 
this end. Wily maneuvers were plotted, districts were "stuffed" 
with deputies, and "his" people worked tirelessly. But despite 
the predictions, the people of Ukraine went to the elections 
even on a more massive scale than was the case in December in 
Russia, where the campaigning was quite heavy. 
  We will risk making the conjecture that if the presidential 
election is in fact held, L. Kravchuk will lose. It is possible 
he will not even make it to the second round. Naturally, all the 
actions of his team--the "party of power"--will be aimed at 
postponing the election. The newspapers, radio, and television, 
devoted to L. Kravchuk, have already set about accomplishing 
this (at the same time they are attempting to resuscitate the 
fairly shaken prestige of L. Kravchuk, to ideologically dust off 
his somewhat worn political image, publishing all kinds of tales 
of the variety that appeared in KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, and not 
only there). To the extent I am aware, an address by L. Kravchuk 
to the parliament and the people on the need to postpone the 
time frame for the presidential election is in the preparation 
stage. I believe every possible alternative will be employed, up 
to and including a referendum--to which, incidentally, the 
president has the right. In other words, the tactics are 
simple--prevent the election even if it kills him. Here like 
never before another wave of anti-Russian hysteria will come in 
handy, as will the search for enemies of sovereign power, the 
"fifth column" headed by that ardent enemy of L. Kravchuk and of 
the nation--Leonid Kuchma. 
  Well, such is the logic of the struggle for power. And as 
yet 
no one has ever voluntarily rejected it--power. Except perhaps 
for Nikolay II, and he was actually coerced. Standing behind L. 
Kravchuk is the giant mass of today's managers and 
administrators. They will do everything in their power to see to 
it that no one else is allowed to get near the feeding trough, 
pretty heavily depleted though it is. The ideological refrain of 
the "party of power" and national-democratic forces connected to 
it: "To date there is no guarantor of sovereignty and statehood 
in Ukraine other than Leonid Kravchuk." 
  This is all quite sad, for in maintaining our present 
situation, our economic, political, and spiritual crises will 
become irreversible. 
<H5>  Ivan Plyushch </H5>
  Candidate Number One. His popularity among the people is 
legendary and anecdotal. "Wait, wait,"--they told me in one 
village, drowning out the loudspeaker. "We had a stableman like 
that in our crew who would stir everything up. Could this be 
him?" Hidden behind a somewhat feigned simplicity, at times with 
excessively painstaking effort to mispronounce his speech--not 
overly literate to begin with--is a keen, shrewd mind, 
phenomenal memory, and the ability to listen and to hear. Ivan 
Plyushch is a 100-percent "crafty Ukrainian," and rural 
residents constitute his electorate. Just the appearance of 
Plyushch on the television screen is enough to elicit a grimace 
of skepticism on reflective city intellectuals. Which he 
realizes, incidentally, and answers representatives of this 
"narrow segment" in the same vein. As if to say--you know what 
they are all about, writers... His base is the powerful agrarian 
lobby of large kolkhoz and sovkhoz owners, the diversified 
system of rural soviets, etc. This system remains intact 
probably only in Ukraine, and is named not in jest the party of 
Plyushch. 
  From director of a poultry farm--to leader of parliament, 
and 
then president of the state. Those who have decided to vote for 
him see their own--the Ukrainian dream, personified in this 
manner. Open and direct, from the lower classes, he speaks 
simply, like most of those raised in the rye and wheat. 
Everything about him is clear. His language is strong if need 
be, and he can be scolding. But he can withdraw just as quickly, 
forgive and forget. And he will share his piece of bread and 
butter. He will be a fair president, and perhaps will give some 
land. God grant him health! 
  Meanwhile, the latest steps and actions of Ivan Plyushch 
show 
that he has become significantly more skilled in politics, where 
the simpleminded and somewhat eccentric are left in the 
background. 
  "I do not change my position time and again, as others do. 
Incidentally, those who do change their position, who adjust 
it--have many opponents. Leonid Makarovich likes this very much. 
He believes a politician is one who does all this. I always 
disagree with him here. He once said that a politician is a 
person who is able to discern the mood of the masses. But I 
believe a politician takes a mood to the masses and then leads 
them behind it, behind himself. Otherwise the politician is not 
moving ahead of the masses, but is instead following--which is 
dangerous." 
  We will risk making the conjecture that if the election is 
held, and if Plyushch and Kuchma make it to the finish line, 
Plyushch will be the victor. He is the more "pro-Ukrainian" 
candidate. 
<H5>  Leonid Kuchma </H5>
  One leader of the national-democratic movement made a 
dreadful attributive comment with respect to the former Komsomol 
organizer, party organizer, and Yuzhmash director, stating that 
he destroyed the government and then left with extremely high 
standing. Here is the opinion of a former comrade-in-arms. "He 
was conniving with the mafia behind my back, and I--fool that I 
was--trusted him." His current rival for the post says: "A model 
protege of the military-industrial complex and mafia structures." 
  This in no way completes all the "gingerbread" attributed to 
Leonid Kuchma, an outwardly calm and intelligent man with 
pleasant manners and measured, quiet voice, the person who first 
spoke of the existence of a mafia at the highest levels--selling 
out the country wholesale and retail. At that time his words 
aroused the people, and the hope emerged that perhaps everything 
would change, that life would become at least a little bit 
better and less dangerous. They called Kuchma's Cabinet of 
Ministers the government of last hope. Alas time passed, and the 
nomenklatura openly blocked and perverted the reforms. The 
procuracy "delayed," the Ukrainian Security Council and Ministry 
of Internal Affairs found themselves as always "outside the 
loop," and mafia clans rallied, "knocking" the supporters of 
reforms out of the government--I. Yukhnovskyy, V. Pynzenyk, Yu. 
Ioffe--while Kuchma gave into them all too obediently. We know 
full well how everything turned out. 
  But his memory among the people is a kind one. Perhaps 
because--to the same degree as Plyushch--he responds to the 
expectations of a fairly large number of average citizens of the 
eastern region. He speaks Russian better than Ukrainian, is not 
hurrying towards relations with Russia but is not shying away 
from the issue either. He is trying to clarify, at least for 
himself, exactly what it is we are trying to build--whether it 
is a market with capitalism, or socialism with rationing for 
some and special distribution for others. Though it would seem 
no one else in Ukraine knows either. 
  The "red" directors, military-industrial complex, and 
Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs are behind 
Kuchma. Against him are all the national-democrats, the "party 
of power," and Plyushch's group. The alignment is clearly skewed 
in their direction. However, sociologists assert that were the 
election held today, he would gather the most votes (15.2 
percent--twice as many as L. Kravchuk). Who will gain the upper 
hand? 
<H5>  Vladimir Lanovyy </H5>
  A hopeless reformer and market advocate. He has his own 
concept of extricating Ukraine from its economic crisis, but no 
one has ever asked for it. Under pressure from democratic 
forces, he was brought into the conservative government of V. 
Fokin as deputy prime minister and minister of economics. A 
"strange bird" there, time and again he escaped the attacks of 
experienced apparatchiks, but was soon dismissed by edict of the 
president. Why--we do not yet know. 
  In ordinary life he is an intelligent, soft-spoken, likable 
individual, an outstanding family man. He is an analytical 
storehouse of knowledge, more a theoretician than a practical 
organizer. He is hindered by a lack of experience in apparatus 
work. 
  Following his departure from the Cabinet of Ministers, he 
founded the Center for Market Reforms, where he assembled bright 
minds. He is stubbornly biding his time, polishing up his 
economic concepts. I am firmly convinced that Lanovyy's time 
will come and his theories will prove useful. Many 
entrepreneurial circles support him, people for whom it is 
already too late to stop or ponder about where we are headed. 
They believe him and have fallen in line. Now guarantees by the 
state are needed. Guarantees which, in their opinion, may be 
obtained if Lanovyy becomes president. 
  All the same, I believe his chances of victory are not 
great. 
It is not yet Lanovyy's time. 
<H5>  Aleksandr Moroz, Petr Simonenko, and Others </H5>
  Nor is it the time of Moroz or Simonenko. In fact their very 
nomination is somewhat strange. On the one hand, yesterday's 
second and even third-rank Communist Party functionaries are all 
too fervently thirsting for power. They are displaying their 
former eagerness, not ashamed of elbowing aside not only 
inveterate Rukh people, but each other as well. "We have certain 
grievances against the Ukrainian Communist Party which, despite 
agreements reached previously, has nominated candidates in 
districts we already occupy. There has not been such action on 
the part of the socialists." Maybe in revenge the communists 
conducted their own conference behind closed doors, discussing 
"intra-party matters." 
  Incidentally, as we know, a parliamentary-presidential 
structure is set into the program of the socialists, and so 
their claims of victory are understandable. It is another matter 
with the Communist Party of Ukraine, which rejects out of hand 
the presidential form of rule. "But look, we have decided to 
participate, taking into account the circumstances of the 
present moment." There will be some laughter if they come out 
and take the election--what do they do with the presidency? But 
then again, no problem. You can always adjust the statutes a 
bit--it would not be the first time! 
  Of course, neither the socialists nor the communists have 
any 
chance of winning the presidential election--so painfully 
importunate are their slogans and the deceitful actions we are 
so sick and tired of. I believe they too understand this and 
will therefore use the present election round, which holds no 
prospects for them, in the vein of the well-known sporting 
principle--the main thing is to participate, "to get exposure." 
  And so, we have three clear leaders from among the nominated 
candidates, those same familiar faces--L. Kravchuk, I. Plyushch, 
and L. Kuchma. Leonid Kravchuk will most probably not register 
as an official candidate, but instead propose to the parliament 
that the election be postponed. In that event, whether the 
election is postponed or not, the most probable contenders will 
be down to two--Leonid Kuchma and Ivan Plyushch. I will state 
quite frankly that the choice is not very great. And for 
Ukraine, this is a major catastrophe. 
  P.S. When this issue was going to print, it became 
clear that the number of candidates for the office of president 
had increased. Among those additionally seeking the post: former 
Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Pynzenyk and Nikolay Rud, associate 
at a Kiev institute of higher education. It cannot be ruled out 
that the ranks of contenders will be further augmented in the 
coming days, to the extent that the presidential election 
ballots may have to be printed on two sides. But, we are 
familiar with this kind of thing...

<F P=106> [Interview with People's Deputy of Ukraine Oleksandr Moroz </F>
by Anatoliy Kraslyanskyy; place and date not given: "Oleksandr 
Moroz: Pick Grain by Grain, And You Will Have Bread"] 
  [Text] There is no need to introduce People's Deputy 
of Ukraine Oleksandr Moroz--he is a well-known politician. We 
asked him to share his thoughts on the eve of opening the first 
session of the Supreme Council 13th term. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] Oleksandr Oleksandrovich, you are, as they 
say, not a novice in the Supreme Council, since you were a 
member in the previous term and have now been elected a people's 
deputy of Ukraine for the second time. What would you like to 
reject of the things associated with the previous Supreme 
Council, what would you like to preserve, and what would you 
like to add in order for it to work successfully? 
  [Moroz] Of the creative achievements of the Supreme Council, 
I would take the level of political professionalism, which last 
year began to acquire clearer shape. I feel that when the 
deputies worked on concrete legislative acts, they put aside 
ideological disagreements and the knowledge acquired over four 
years of deputy experience began to work. We really have gone 
through a great school of learning, and it would be imprudent to 
disregard it. 
  The work of the previous Supreme Council, however, was 
replete with shortcomings, and they need to be consigned to 
history. For instance, we have to discard the system of 
lawmaking. The answer to the question recently asked by the then 
Prime Minister L. Kuchma--what we are building?--needed to be 
given back in 1990, at least after the all-Ukraine referendum. 
Had we such an answer, in its content we should have worked out 
the structure and sequence of steps in adopting laws. Then the 
commission on questions of legislation and legality, as well as 
other commissions, could function in accordance with a clear 
program. One of the deputies of the Supreme Council chairman 
should have put together a sort of a schedule of preparation of 
laws and "monitor the progress" of each law from conception to 
adoption and control over its "life." There was no such system. 
The process of lawmaking itself was chaotic, and this became one 
of the reasons that the laws did not correlate with one another; 
they lacked financial and scientific substantiation, and a 
forecast of the consequences of their action in society. 
  One more thing. If we know what people themselves want to 
say 
regarding preservation in the constitution, for instance, of 
social guarantees regarding work, free education, and so on, 
then why do we disregard citizens' feelings? Why do we act 
against the will of the people? Is this democracy? Is this a 
proper position for the supreme organ of authority? The new 
parliament should develop an institute of lawmaking. It does not 
have to be necessarily a staff structure--it can be a small 
group of organizers-scholars, jurists, who would form a creative 
group and develop a system of making concrete laws, perhaps 
through a competition. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] In the beginning of our conversation you 
mentioned the subject of ideological disagreements. Judging by 
the composition of the current parliament, it will also 
certainly have plenty of such disagreements. How do you see 
overcoming them? Finally, with whom are you going to join forces 
and with whom will you seek compromise? 
  [Moroz] One can never make the Supreme Council free of 
ideological discussion--this simply would be against its nature. 
The point is to make it a mere addition to lawmaking work in the 
parliament. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] In principle, law in itself is ideology... 
  [Moroz] Undoubtedly. We understand very well that politics 
is 
relations between people and the corresponding spheres in the 
state that are regulated by laws or other normative acts. 
  As to unproductive political clashes within parliament 
walls, 
much depends in this respect on the organization of the Supreme 
Council's work, on the formation of its governing structures, 
the order in which they will consider those draft laws and 
questions that concern people most today. Knowing their mood, I 
will say that current economic problems concern people more than 
anything. Speaking of contentions of individual politicians that 
the fault for all the troubles lies with the communists, who 
allegedly are in power even now, you may rest assured: People 
have figured out today who is who, who defended the versions of 
privatization that made the plunder of Ukraine possible. Here is 
economics and politics for you all at once. Knowing these 
circumstances, realizing that we have to climb out of the pit 
into which we have fallen, and giving the commissions some or 
other laws that deal with economic problems for consideration, I 
think that along this road we will have fewer ideological 
battles, since a concrete cause demands concrete action, and for 
the sake of it one can put aside irreconcilable views. 
  As soon as we start moving in the direction of economic 
stabilization and people start feeling that the crisis is 
subsiding, then the intensity of issues will diminish 
considerably. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] A logical question: Do you see a way of 
extricating Ukraine from its difficult economic situation? 
  [Moroz] Today this is the most difficult question for 
anyone. 
The Supreme Council apparently must first resolve the main 
problem on this path: forming a capable, competent, decisive 
government. I know this is not easy. But Ukraine has never had 
its own government--a government of a state. Ukraine has not had 
and still does not have its own economy. It is still not treated 
by our executive authority as a single organism. We need to find 
in the state a first person who will measure up to this task, be 
able to get a grip on the situation as a whole. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] Do you have a candidate in mind? 
  [Moroz] There are various proposals and options. Without 
naming any persons in particular, I will only say that in this 
matter we need to resolutely reject strictly ideological 
criteria. This has already done great harm to our economy. 
Today, of course, there are many who are regretful, while 
perhaps some are rejoicing, carrying out someone's instructions, 
that this has happened, but it is true that since the fall of 
1990 every new government has been weaker than the previous one. 
From a political viewpoint perhaps it would be unsuitable to 
turn to the specialists of the past, but I would step over all 
these nuances for the sake of having good professionals in the 
Cabinet of Ministers. Although usually new people, new 
approaches, and a fresh team generate faster hope and confidence 
in the authorities. There are options. And we are not talking 
here about a return to the command-administrative system. 
  Thus, to start with it is necessary to form in the Cabinet 
of 
Ministers a team that will understand all these tasks and 
nuances and will not strive to turn to the methods of leadership 
that have already brought great harm to our economy. At the same 
time, power structures need to resolutely rid themselves of 
corruption and abuse, and repulse anyone's desire to profit from 
others' misfortunes. On the other hand, they need to create 
conditions so as to eliminate the possibility of engaging in 
dirty business in the corridors of power. And one more thing. 
Labor can be effective only when economic incentives begin to 
work instead of compulsory forms of state orders or detailed 
planning. 
  At the same time I think that at the macrolevel the state 
sector of the economy must have clear leadership. And we see 
that current economic management is being conducted in such a 
way that the state sector is being destroyed, consistently and 
purposefully. Already about 20 percent of the means of 
production at state enterprises has been privatized. They 
somehow still operate, agonize, but at the same time produce the 
main part of the gross output. The state sector has been placed 
in mortal circumstances; it is being deliberately strangled and 
destroyed. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] Judging by everything, you now support a 
change of authority, the creation of conditions that would put 
an end to the chaos and, as you put it, abuse and 
irresponsibility. Would it be correct to say that in this 
current difficult period you support a restoration of the 
dictatorship of authority? 
  [Moroz] I am for the dictatorship of order. And in this 
respect it is not necessary to bring dictatorship to 
authoritarian methods of organizing the authority. What I mean 
is that everyone and everything should be subordinate to the 
law, and that the latter should deal ruthlessly with whoever 
attempts to violate it. For this we have to build up the 
structure of power. I am convinced that the Council, which in 
one form or another exists all over the world as the mechanism 
of authority, presents great opportunities for establishing 
order. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] So, Oleksandr Oleksandrovich, which form of 
authority do you support: parliamentary, 
parliamentary-presidential, or presidential? 
  [Moroz] For the current stage of development of Ukrainian 
statehood I think the most suitable form of authority is 
parliamentary-presidential. Although in the future, when the 
situation in the economy stabilizes and society emerges from 
cataclysm onto a straight road, we could do with a parliamentary 
republic. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] I disagree with you in this respect. Knowing 
the character traits of our people, their eternal striving for 
Cossack freedom, where each is his own master, I think that 
broad democracy in the form of a parliamentary republic may turn 
into all-out anarchy and harm our statehood. And did you not 
yourself feel at the time of the election campaign that people 
want a strong authority concentrated in the hands of one person? 
  [Moroz] I think what people want is order and confidence in 
tomorrow. They are not looking for salvation in a hetman or a 
tsar. They are searching first of all for a way to realize their 
labor potential. When we create motivation for labor, people 
will respect both the law and the state. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] I would like to finish the conversation where 
we started. Which is: Although the new parliament has not 
convened yet, to my knowledge deputy factions have already been 
practically formed. You head one of them. With whom are you 
planning to work, and with whom to reach compromises? 
  [Moroz] Regarding leadership of a faction--thank you. This 
is 
news to me. And differentiation is indeed emerging. As to 
compromises, I will say this: It depends on the purpose and for 
the sake of what a compromise is being sought. If it is for the 
fulfillment of the task I consider to be the most 
important--overcoming the economic catastrophe--I am ready to 
work with anyone. What is currently needed is action instead of 
quarreling; we need to find the rational in different positions. 
As they say, pick grain by grain, and you will have bread.

<F P=106> [Interview with People's Deputy Vasyl Durdynets by </F>
UKRAYINSKA HAZETA correspondent Oleksandr Skoryna; place and 
date not given: "Vasyl Durdynets Calls People's Deputies Toward 
the `Center'"] 
  [Text] A deputy group called the "Center" has been set up 
in the structure of the new Ukrainian parliament. Its initiative 
core is headed by Vasyl Durdynets, a newly elected deputy and 
formerly the deputy head of the Ukrainian Supreme Council of the 
previous, twelfth convocation. Considering that a rather 
"motley" public has come to "power" and that it probably will 
not be easy to find a common language for all, the idea of an 
apparently unifying "Center" is rather attractive and is very 
much needed in our current conditions. In order to learn about 
the Center in detail and firsthand, I met with Vasyl Vasylyovych 
Durdynets. Our conversation was democratic, friendly, and, of 
course, candid. First, it was pleasant to learn that Vasyl 
Vasylyovych respects UKRAYINSKA HAZETA; second, I encountered a 
true patriot of the Ukrainian state. 
  Over the four years of its work, said my esteemed 
interlocutor, the Supreme Council adopted 402 laws and 1,108 
decrees. This is a considerable volume of work. But people 
appraise it, of course, not by the numbers but by the way these 
documents are being implemented and are working to strengthen 
the economy, legality, and law and order, for the social good of 
the people, especially their security and standard of living. To 
be honest, in making decisions on many problems the former 
membership of the Supreme Council unfortunately gave preference 
to corporate, departmental, regional, and political interests 
rather than being guided by the interests of all the people. Of 
course, pulling the blanket to one side this way could not 
benefit the entire society. It would be wrong to continue such a 
practice... Out of such considerations, the Center deputy group 
was set up within the structure of our new parliament. It unites 
the deputies who have come to the Supreme Council to do 
constructive work. This strong, and, as was to be expected, 
centrist bloc can take upon itself the main constructive 
lawmaking activities. 
  [Skoryna] How? 
  [Durdynets] How? First, on the basis of coordinating the 
positions of groups, factions, and individual deputies it can 
recommend candidates for the Supreme Council's permanent 
leadership bodies, the new government, work out coordinated 
proposals, and decide on principal all-state problems. 
  Look, in the new parliament membership we have both the 
extreme left and the extreme right. In order to avoid rocking 
our already fragile state boat, we need a consolidating basis. 
The people elected us to finally adopt such laws as would work 
for their benefit, for the good of Ukraine. All of us without 
fail will have to make this happen. 
  Our bloc is called "For Accord and Collaboration." When we 
achieve accord, we will have collaboration. If there is no 
accord between deputies of different political views, 
directions, and interests, there will be no constructive 
collaboration from the very first days of the work of the newly 
elected Supreme Council. 
  By the way, why do I say "new convocation." There is 
currently an idea to call the current Supreme Council not the 
thirteenth but the first convocation. And I must say that there 
are all the grounds for this, as well as the legal basis. We are 
beginning a new count of the activities of the parliament of a 
new state, elected on the basis of new laws. 
  [Skoryna] How do you form the membership of your group? What 
is required of a deputy who wants to participate in its 
activities? 
  [Durdynets] A deputy may read the program, which clearly 
describes the group's goals and tasks, the conditions for 
joining it, and its organizational basis. If he agrees with all 
this, he submits an individual application indicating his 
surname, name and patronymic, and the electoral district he 
represents. 
  However, if over time a deputy in his practical activities 
deviates from the obligations he undertook as part of becoming a 
member of our association, at the general meeting we will bring 
up the question of expelling him. Our work is built on 
democratic principles and openness, but elementary discipline 
and organization are also necessary. Without them, the group is 
not going to last long... 
  [Skoryna] Vasyl Vasylyovych, you and I remember well with 
what drive and how dynamically a group of deputies that 
functioned under the name People's Council began its work within 
the previous convocation of our parliament. Under the leadership 
of its inspirer, they stayed after plenary sessions, labored 
over new draft laws and initiative propositions until late at 
night, set the tone by their organization, purposefulness, by 
being specific in bringing up issues and preparing drafts of 
various documents. Just as persistently, they brought each 
undertaking to a logical end. After some time, however, the 
drive began to diminish, and deputies began to split from the 
group one after another. Will something like this not happen to 
the newly created group? 
  [Durdynets] I hope that this will not happen. We are not 
dragging anyone to join by force. Here is the program. If it is 
in line with your own views, join in the work; if not--act at 
your own discretion. Once again, nobody wants to keep anyone in 
the group by force. But if you did agree to participate, then 
you have to work conscientiously. 
  [Skoryna] That is, as I see it, by the very fact of joining 
the Center group a deputy once again reaffirms to his voters 
that he has come to the first parliament of independent Ukraine 
not to engage in empty talk or pursue some sort of personal 
political ambitions. That is, not so that he may show his face 
on television, but to do painstaking, purposeful work for the 
good of his electorate, and the good of the country. 
  [Durdynets] Exactly. And we, on our part, assist members of 
our group in every way to gradually make good on their election 
pledges. This is important for the authority of the deputy and 
the Supreme Council. Voters can see, feel at their everyday 
level that a change for the better is not just voted for but is 
being implemented. And then he will know that his vote, his 
instructions to his deputy, do play a role in this. We need to 
work together to build an authority that will work for our 
independent state, and a state that will work for the people. 
  [Skoryna] Vasyl Vasylyovych, I see in the list of the Center 
group persons of, one may say, diametrically opposite views. You 
have here Landyk and Zvyahilskyy, Yukhnovskyy and Pilipchuk, 
Zhulinskyy, Yavorivskyy, and others. Will this not be another 
attempt to harness to the same cart a swan, a crayfish, and a 
pike? Will these people be able to work in the same key? 
  [Durdynets] I am convinced that they will because we at the 
Center are united by a common goal. Today the greatest problem 
for Ukraine is economic crisis. To overcome it, economists, 
jurists, industrial managers, political scientists, scholars, 
and government members must join forces. That is, all deputies 
who want and can work constructively on documents either 
submitted or initiated by us for the Supreme Council's 
consideration. That is why we did not invite people to the group 
individually--you, you, and you... We asked everyone who wants 
to work together, for instance, with Academician Yukhnovskyy, 
writer Yavorivskyy, the jurist brothers Kostytskyy... The people 
who have gathered here are specialists of different profiles, 
different political views. And I feel that they are united by a 
common constructive idea--building a strong independent state. 
For this we first need to build a strong economy, which will 
provide people with the ability to work better, earn more, and 
live better. This is the main point. Everything else is 
secondary. 
  [Skoryna] I also think that it is time to free the Supreme 
Council of political battles and move them to political clubs, 
party meetings, newspapers, television, radio, and so on. We 
have had enough verbiage in 70 years. Otherwise it is like it 
happens in everyday life--a good housewife in an hour or two 
manages to milk a cow, feed the pig and the chickens, and cook 
borscht, while her neighbors have barely covered half the 
village in their gossip in the same time. So it is with us: 
Neighboring countries are striving to build their lives, while 
we are still trying to figure out where to go and what to do. 
Sometimes it is funny to watch all this, but more often it is 
sad. That is why we need to salute you and the deputies who urge 
their colleagues to get down to business. What concerns me and 
many Ukrainians is another "center," the one created in the 
parliament by the do-gooder Kuchma. What do you think about it, 
Vasyl Vasylyovych? I figure that every parliament may have 
different factions, but two centers... This is practiced only in 
soccer... 
  [Durdynets] First, I would like to refrain from criticizing 
them. I think they have already realized this: They worked up so 
much publicity with their interregional reform bloc before the 
elections... Gatherings, meetings, conferences, and so on, and 
so forth. And how many deputy seats did they win? Only a few 
here and there. However, we will collaborate with them if they 
express willingness to unite on the basis of what I described 
above... And the foundation of everything is to put the 
interests of Ukraine first. 
  Our colleague Volodymyr Lanovyy was at our meeting, for 
instance. He is putting together his own faction, but said that 
he intends to collaborate with us in the same bloc. Chornovil 
said the same. And the same goes for other faction leaders who 
understand the need to unite... 
  [Skoryna] Please name the organizational core of your 
Center. 
  [Durdynets] As you may have guessed, they are well-known 
figures--Ivan Plyushch, Ihor Yukhnovskyy, Valeriy Cherep, Mykola 
Zhulynskyy, Oleksandr Bandurka, Roman Shpek, Volodymyr Bortnyk. 
Mykola Surgay, Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, Anton Buteyko... we 
consult, coordinate our work... There is already a plan for the 
first session. In addition to pressing organizational matters, 
it is necessary, without wasting any time, to consider three 
sets of priority questions. They are: the way of extricating the 
country from the deep economic crisis (fundamental reform of the 
monetary-credit and tax system, taking under control foreign 
economic activities, issues of prices and price formation, 
privatization, and so on). 
  Another set of issues is establishing order in the country: 
ridding the apparat of corrupt, bureaucratic elements; curbing 
speculation; and tough--and real, not just 
lip-service--suppression of crime. And the third is control. So 
that the laws and decrees of the Supreme Council work, are 
implemented, instead of remaining, as often happens, mere 
declarations. 
  Our state is in such shape that we have no right to spend 
time on rallies, political quarrels, a tug-of-war. We have no 
time left for "rousing to action." Therefore, I appeal to my 
colleagues--people's deputies for whom our goals and views are 
not foreign, who set their sights on constructive activities and 
do not want to get bogged down in internal fights--to 
consolidate all forces for everyday painstaking, concentrated 
work. This what the people of Ukraine expect of the newly 
elected parliament.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Prytula, staff correspondent of MOLOD </F>
UKRAYINY, under the rubric "Hello, Simferopol!": "The Chairman's 
First `Victory' "] 
  [Text] The first session of the newly elected Supreme 
Council of Crimea opened on 10 May. It is not too early to say 
that that day saw the beginning of a new stage in the political 
life of the autonomous republic. And it began with a rather 
resounding scandal. 
  The monolithic Russia bloc, which holds a majority in the 
Crimean parliament, proved to be made of clay and full of 
cracks. The split was caused by disagreement over the candidates 
for the office of the chairman of the autonomous republic's 
Supreme Council. The scandal itself broke out because Serhiy 
Tsekov, one of the candidates for the speaker's office, connived 
at concealing from the public that Serhiy Kovalevskyy, a Russia 
bloc deputy, had a criminal record. It was learned that S. 
Kovalevsky had once been sentenced to eight years of 
imprisonment for taking part in a gang rape of a minor girl. 
These "revelations," which were initiated by Deputy V. 
Mordashov, also a Russia bloc activist, who supported V. 
Klychnykov, another candidate of this bloc, nonetheless ended in 
the victory of former People's Deputy of Ukraine Serhiy Tsekov, 
a physician from Saky, who now heads the Republican Movement of 
Crimea [RDK]. Forty-eight of 98 deputies voted for S. Tsekov, 
which was enough to elect him chairman of the Supreme Council of 
Crimea. For Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, who supported 
Tsekov, this proved a Pyrrhic victory, because it led to a split 
in the "presidential" faction of the Russia bloc. 
  There were strange happenings the following day as well. RDK 
activists O. Melnykov and V. Mezhak, who were nominated by the 
newly elected speaker and whose candidacies had been approved at 
a meeting of Russia bloc deputies, were voted down by 
parliament. Undoubtedly, this local crisis in the Supreme 
Council of the autonomous republic will be resolved in time. One 
could attribute it to the inexperience and "youthfulness" of the 
Crimean deputies. But some parliamentarians are already critical 
of their colleagues. Deputy Serhiy Shuryha, a well-known 
businessman from Sevastopol, told MOLOD UKRAYINA's correspondent 
in an interview that as things stand today, the Crimean Supreme 
Council in its present composition is far removed from vital 
economic problems and could become mired in politicking. Deputy 
Lilya Budzhurova, a Crimean Tatar journalist, agrees with him: 
"Unfortunately, the majority of the Russia bloc deputies are 
aggressive or simply incompetent in many matters that are of 
vital importance to parliamentarians." Thus the direction in 
which the newly elected parliament of the autonomous republic 
will lead the Crimea remains an open question.

<F P=106> [Interview with Borys Klimchuk, chairman of the Volyn Oblast </F>
Council of People's Deputies, by Bohdan Bereketa under the 
rubric "Life of the Councils"; date and place not given: " `You 
Can See Things From the Top, But Not Everything,' Said Borys 
Klimchuk, Chairman of the Volyn Oblast Council of People 
Deputies, in a Conversation with Our Correspondent" --first two 
paragraphs are HOLOS UKRAYINY introduction] 
  [Text] The rise of Borys Petrovych Klimchuk two years ago 
to the office of chairman of the Volyn Oblast Council was 
something of a surprise. A teacher by profession, he had never 
worked in the party nomenklatura organs... Moreover, he wears a 
moustache and a beard. Who ever saw such a thing -- a council 
chairman with a beard! He was asked at the session of the 
council: "What do you plan to do about your beard?" Borys 
Petrovych replied: "If you want me to be chairman of the oblast 
council, I will do the job. But do not force me to get rid of my 
beard..." 
  And, you know, the beard and moustache are very becoming to 
him. 
  [Bereketa] Our conversation dealt with the elections and 
creating new governing structures. First and foremost, new local 
government organs. What does Borys Klimchuk think about this? 
  [Klimchuk] I believe that there should be elections. This is 
one way of solving the crisis in which we find ourselves. We 
need new people in the local administrative organs. People whom 
the public trusts. Let us be frank: those currently in power 
have lost the people's trust. New people in the governing organs 
means new thinking in state building. 
  [Bereketa] What do you think the new governing organs should 
be like? 
  [Klimchuk] There has been much talk about local self-rule 
during the last two years. This sounds find in theory. In 
practice, however, we have never been very good at 
self-government. We continued functioning within the overall 
system of state administration based on the old model of the 
councils. We need a law on governing. To put in place a 
mechanism for removing the council chairman from office by the 
corps of deputies. To enable us to retire a council chairman 
from government service. How do we do this? So that officials 
serve the people and the state. So that there are no local 
princelings, who take good care of themselves and of higher 
officials. There needs to be a clear-cut chain of authority: 
from the Cabinet of Ministers to the village council chairman. 
We must learn to submit to controls, be willing to listen to the 
voice of the majority, take a long-range view of our work at the 
local level and a long-range view of the development of the 
Ukrainian state. In forming the new governing structures, we 
must ensure that there is a clear-cut division of powers and no 
double subordination. 
  [Bereketa] What is your attitude to the institution of the 
presidential representative? 
  [Klimchuk] I think that this innovation no longer serves a 
purpose. For a certain period of time, this was a good idea, but 
it was not as successful as it should have been. The 
presidential representatives in the oblasts and rayons became 
something in the nature of executive committees; they became 
involved in solving petty, everyday problems. But there were no 
structures to oversee and correct their activities. Obviously, 
we could create some sort of local bodies to oversee compliance 
with the law. Because, in all honesty, virtually no one is 
currently performing any supervisory functions. If an official 
has a conscience and a sense of responsibility, he does some 
good work. If he lacks these qualities, he does nothing. We have 
to admit that work in the state structures has become 
prestigious and provides some benefits. If it were up to me, I 
would establish a contract system for state officials. We should 
take everything we can from these people and then some. Our 
times require that kind of work. At all levels. I do not like it 
when people cite all sorts of circumstances which allegedly 
prevent them from doing their jobs. 
  [Bereketa] There has lately been a great deal of discussion 
about what kind of state Ukraine should be... 
  [Klimchuk] I support those who believe that Ukraine should 
be 
a unitary state. Only in a unitary state will we be able to 
conduct the necessary economic reforms. As far as I am 
concerned, we should throw the word "federalism" out of our 
vocabulary. Nor does it make sense to play incomprehensible 
games with certain regions, promising them greater powers. The 
regions of a single state must not be divided into sovereign 
principalities. We have our Ukraine, and we must all care for it 
in equal fashion. 
  [Bereketa] How would you describe Volyn's contribution to 
the 
economic development of Ukraine? Can we do more than we are 
doing? 
  [Klimchuk] Volyn is a unique kind of border oblast. I would 
even call it Ukraine's gateway to Europe. We have manpower 
resources. We are rich in lakes and forests. We have bread, 
meat... You know, just a few years ago, people used to ask 
indignantly: "Who ate our meat?" And now they ask: "Who will eat 
our meat?" We have a great deal to sell and trade. But the 
expansion of our external economic relations is being hampered 
by our ineffective system of currency regulation and the fact 
that our normative documents are flawed. That is why we place 
our hopes in the new government and in the new laws that will 
force our economy to work without all sorts of "isms." 
  [Bereketa] Borys Petrovych, you recently agreed to run 
[again] for the office of chairman of the oblast council of 
people's deputies. I have in mind in the new elections. Are you 
not afraid? 
  [Klimchuk] No. Generally speaking, we should not be afraid 
of 
elections. Nor of the new people who will come to the oblast 
council. The popular filter is effective and very fine. Of 
course, anything can happen. But I believe that the Volynians 
will elect worthy people. I myself am not very fearful by 
nature; I live for the future. I am already putting together a 
new team for the oblast council. You'll tell me that I'm way 
ahead of myself... Perhaps. But somebody will find use for my 
experience. 
  [Bereketa] What, in your opinion, are the most important 
problems that need to be solved by local government in Volyn? 
  [Klimchuk] This is not an easy question. But since you ask, 
let me say something about the problem of families with many 
children. Just imagine, our oblast has nearly 20,000 families 
with three to ten and more children. Last year, we closed down 
10 kindergartens. We have 35 physicians per 10,000 residents. 
The situation with respect to medical care is especially 
critical in the rayons that have been contaminated with 
radiation. We are managing on our own somehow, but this is an 
issue of national significance. The birth rate in Polissya is 
falling. This is a dangerous situation. Yet those in the highest 
echelons of government do not seem to be concerned. That is why 
I believe that one of the main tasks facing local government 
organs is ensuring the largest possible tax base. Governing 
requires money. And families with many children are in great 
need of assistance. 
  [Bereketa] Let us imagine that you have been elected 
chairman 
of the new oblast council. What kind of powers would you like to 
have? 
  [Klimchuk] To be able to veto the decisions of lower-level 
governing organs. To have the decision of the council chairman 
accepted without further discussion. Unconditional execution. 
Less talk and more action. We have had more than enough 
collective irresponsibility; there is a need for personal 
accountability. The people have elected you, they trust you, 
then, by all means, be accountable to them and the state. 
  [Bereketa] What would you like to wish the new members of 
the 
new local government structures? 
  [Klimchuk] To believe in themselves and in our Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Saburov, head of the Crimean </F>
cabinet, by L. Kononova; place and date not given: "The 
Flag-Waving Begins When the Money Comes To Be Shared Out"] 
  [Text] Some political scientists have evaluated as an 
act which is unprecedented in terms of personal courage and 
unpredictable in its consequences the consent of Yevgeniy 
Saburov (deputy prime minister and minister of economics in the 
I. Silayev government and director of the Center for Information 
and Social Technology under the present government) to head 
Crimea's ministerial cabinet. On 11 March of this year the 
Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Crimea confirmed Ye. Saburov 
as head of the Crimean Government. What are the first results of 
the activity of the new cabinet? How is the political and 
economic situation in Crimea developing? This was the subject of 
our discussion with Yevgeniy Fedorovich Saburov. 
  [Kononova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, what did you find attractive 
in Crimean President Yu. Meshkov's offer of the post of head of 
the cabinet? Which of the difficulties that you have encountered 
in your first month of work have come as a surprise to you? 
  [Saburov] This invitation attracted me primarily by the 
possibility of the realization in practice of the ideas and 
principles of the implementation of economic reforms which seem 
to me paramount. 
  In my view, it is extraordinarily important that a 
democratic 
government pursue its reforms with a view to the populace. That 
it not play at being some omniscient guru who has endeavored by 
his shamanistic incantations of the Phillips' Curve or 
monetarist theory type to evoke the spirit of capitalism on the 
sinful land and serve it up to the ignoramuses surrounding him 
but implement reforms openly, explaining to people and 
coordinating with them his every action. 
  As far as the difficulties I have encountered are concerned, 
there have, I must confess, been no particular surprises. 
Everything was, essentially, expected. The only thing I did not 
expect was the weakness of the Ukrainian Government. A strong 
government that knows what it wants expresses this, as a rule, 
and it is possible to come to terms with it on some matters. A 
weak government changes its views three times a day, is in a 
state of continual mild hysteria, is not sure that it will be 
there tomorrow, and does not know how to shore up its positions. 
Coming to terms with such a government is absolutely impossible. 
Even here, in Russia, I heard from friends negotiating with 
various states: The negotiations with Ukraine are the worst 
since it is absolutely incomprehensible what they want. The 
point is that there never was Ukrainian statehood, it has 
emerged for the first time. And this concept itself is at this 
time in an absolutely infantile state, no one has the faintest 
idea what this means. As a result Ukraine is erecting 
prohibitory barriers where they have never been erected by the 
Baltic or Western countries, but is at the same time doing some 
things such as though there were still a State Planning 
Committee and it were possible to go to it with any purchase 
orders. Something quite childlike and unstructured shows through 
in all things, and because of this things are quite 
unpredictable. It is extraordinarily difficult working under 
such conditions. 
  [Kononova] And what is the extent of your independence, 
Crimea's independence? 
  [Saburov] Formally, according to the laws of Ukraine, Crimea 
is extraordinarily independent. In fact, however, each action of 
Crimea's causes great confusion in the leadership of Ukraine. We 
constantly encounter: "If we authorize this for you, what would 
our Lvov nationalists say." When you say: "You authorized this a 
long time ago, here are the papers," you hear in response: "Yes, 
we wrote this, but never thought that this is how it would 
actually be." 
  We, however, will insist on fulfillment of the law on the 
delineation of powers between Kiev and Simferopol. This is a 
Ukrainian law, the deputies passed it themselves, let it now be 
fulfilled. 
  Of course, there is also ill will, and there are simple 
natural enemies of Crimea. There is a part of the government 
which would not, generally, have any objections, but is afraid 
of the bad example for other oblasts, is afraid of a division of 
the state. And this is understandable. There are, finally, yet 
others who are simply nobodies and who are worried by just one 
thing--that their chair will be knocked from under them. And 
these people are the most frightening. 
  [Kononova] I realize that a comparison is improper, 
nonetheless, Valentin Fedorov went to Sakhalin not that long 
ago, promising to score inconceivable economic successes there. 
We know how it all ended. What have you really managed to 
achieve? What kind of mark would you give yourself for the six 
weeks of work? 
  [Saburov] Crimea is not Sakhalin, and I am not Fedorov. 
There 
can, truly, be absolutely no comparison here. 
  It is still too early to give any marks. There is 
essentially 
no government yet even. Yes, I have been confirmed by the 
Supreme Soviet of Crimea, but all the rest of the government is 
as before, and it is not working, what is more, and a new one 
has not been appointed. Only now have the first appointments 
been made. And only the upper stratum has been appointed at 
that, but everything at the bottom needs to be changed also. 
Real work has been slowed considerably. Everything is only just 
beginning at this time. 
  [Kononova] You had an opportunity to form your own team? 
  [Saburov] I sharply protest this very word "team." Please 
understand that the economy and state administration are not a 
football. It was those who came to play at state administration 
that put this word in circulation. Let them busy themselves with 
teams and players. I, on the other hand, am inviting specialists 
who are not bound among themselves by any friendly relations and 
who have taken no oaths at a soccer match. They are various 
sorts of people. Each of which is a specialist in his field. 
There is just one principle of personnel 
selection--professional. Not party, not friendship, not some 
other. 
  Have I succeeded in enlisting proper professionals? In some 
positions, yes, in others, no. The pay is, to be frank, 
beggarly, and not everyone will come for this. Those who really 
want to show what they are capable of and to test their ideas in 
practice will. 
  [Kononova] Come from where? 
  [Saburov] From Moscow, Petersburg, Zaporozhye. From various 
places. 
  [Kononova] You do not wish to mention the actual names? 
  [Saburov] I can cite the names only of those who have 
already 
been appointed. They are Muscovites, in the main, people with 
whom there was from the outset a firm agreement that they would 
come. Andrey Vasilyevich Chernyavskiy, minister of economics. 
Lyudmila Mikhaylovna Zaytseva, minister of finance. Viktor 
Nikolayevich Remeyko, Committee for Foreign Economic Relations. 
Anatoliy Romanovich Franchuk, minister for the administration of 
state-run enterprises, has already been appointed. He was a 
member of the previous government, that is, we are preserving a 
certain continuity. This position needs a person who enjoys 
authority among the directors. 
  [Kononova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, you are constantly saying 
that Crimea's economy is strongly tied to that of Russia and 
oriented toward Russian sales markets. To what extent are 
politics getting in the way of economics? Is the situation 
concerning the shareout of the Black Sea Fleet being reflected 
in the activity of Crimea in some way? 
  [Saburov] The Black Sea Fleet situation is a question of who 
will get the money from the sale of old ships. There is no 
politics here. Dough is being shared out. 
  [Kononova] Nonetheless, do you have any wishes you would 
care 
to address to Russian and Ukrainian politicians? 
  [Saburov] One wish: that they not be so avaricious. On 
account of their own greed, both sides have simply paralyzed 
themselves. Ukraine is distinguished by particular avarice, of 
course. This is the "I wouldn't eat it but I'll take a bite" 
from the celebrated story. This is not a story, simply the 
truth. "I won't eat it myself nor will I give it to anyone 
else." Everyone is afraid of making a miscalculation. They are 
arguing about the rent, about who the decommissioned ships 
should be turned over to for scrap. This is good money. There is 
flag-waving only when money is being shared out. 
  [Kononova] And what is your view of Nursultan Nazarbayev's 
idea of the creation of a Eurasian Union? 
  [Saburov] Some newspapers have written that Nazarbayev is 
reiterating Saburov's idea. I disagree with this assertion 
altogether, Nazarbayev's ideas are quite independent. But I 
truly am a supporter of the creation of such a union. But for 
its creation we all need to be a little more civilized. It 
should be remembered that the logic: mine is mine, and yours is 
also mine, is no use here. Sharing is essential. After all, 
Nazarbayev also initially "fell" on Baykonur, but then realized 
that he was not up to it, that maintaining it by himself would 
be difficult. This is why such ideas arise: I cannot finance all 
these things myself, I need Russia, I need some money. Russia is 
somewhat richer. 
  They say, generally, you know, when it is a question of some 
crime or someone's unexpected behavior: "cherchez la femme, look 
for the woman." This is the clue. So here, when high politics 
begins, there is a different clue: look for the money. 
Everything is connected with this. This is, as the ordinary folk 
say, an economic issue. 
  Why was Yuriy Meshkov, the president of Crimea, not admitted 
to the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia apropos the 
fleet? Crimea has every right to take part in these 
negotiations, the fleet's bases are on its territory. No, he was 
elbowed aside, suppose he also requested something or other. It 
is shameful, dear leaders, availing yourselves of Crimean land 
and trying to fool the Crimeans. It was not Meshkov who 
disgraced himself in wanting to take part in these negotiations, 
it was those who refused to admit him to them who disgraced 
themselves, demonstrating to the world their selfish interests. 
  [Kononova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, you have dual citizenship, 
and you remain the research leader at the center where you have 
been working in recent years. Does this mean that you are 
unwilling to burn all your bridges? 
  [Saburov] Yes, I remain a Russian citizen. And if my powers 
and knowledge are needed by the Russian Government, I am always 
at its disposal. Leadership of the center, search for the 
Russian economy's escape from the crisis, and the reforms being 
implemented here will remain for me just as urgent as before. 
  [Kononova] From Crimea our reforms are seen as being.... 
  [Saburov] ...considerably better than from Russia. And 
Chernomyrdin is altogether pursuing a pretty good economic 
policy at this time, in my view. Pretty good. Technically 
competent. He is not, at least, behaving like a bull in a china 
shop. He has shown that we need to know how to work, not live by 
statements and declarations. 
  [Kononova] And the final question. What can you tell 
Russians 
who had been accustomed to spending their summer vacations in 
Crimea? 
  [Saburov] Come. We await you. It is quiet, tranquil, 
provincial here. We will do everything necessary. Crimea's 
resorts are at your service. 
  We are now negotiating and organizing in Moscow a Crimea 
tourist agency. Here we will tell you everything: what passes 
are available, where they are valid, how much they cost, how 
they can be purchased. So come without fail. 
  [Kononova] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Open letter to Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, from </F>
H. Hotovchyts and other officials: "Mr. President! Put a Stop to 
a New Chernobyl!"] 
  [Text] Dear Leonid Makarovych! 
  We feel compelled to write to you concerning Edict N0. 64/94 
"On Urgent Measures Regarding the Development of Nuclear Power 
Engineering and the Formation of the Nuclear Power Cycle in 
Ukraine"--an Edict signed by you and dated 23 February 1994. It 
must be acknowleged that this Edict was not coordinated or 
reconciled with the departments concerned, and this has led to 
several contradictions between its provisions and the 
legislation now in effect. This fact has also 
led--correspondingly--to the impossibility of carrying out 
certain decisions. 
  First of all, that part of the Edict which pertains to the 
burial of radioactive wastes contradicts the "Concepts of the 
State Regulation of the Safety and Administration of the Nuclear 
Industrial Sector in Ukraine," as adopted by the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council on 25 January 1994. 
  The principal questions in this problem concern the burial 
of 
radioactive wastes. In the "Concepts..." adopted by the Supreme 
Council, as well as in the draft laws "On the Utilization of 
Nuclear Power and Radiation Protection" and "On Safety 
Procedures With Radioactive Wastes," which were officially 
submitted by the Cabinet of Ministers to the Supreme Council for 
examination and consideration, it is specified that the 
utilization of nuclear power and the burial of wastes are to be 
carried out based on the principle of delimitation between these 
sectors of activity. 
  Nor can we deem feasible the instructions with regard to the 
tasks of creating a medical-santitation administration within 
the Derzhkomatom [State Committee on Nuclear Power] and 
subordinating the medical-sanitation sections of the AES's 
[nuclear power stations] to it, for this would violate the 
existing system of health care in Ukraine and would inflict 
substantial damage to those measures which are carried out in 
direct subordination to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, taking 
into account the existing shortcomings, as well as the practical 
experience gained in eliminating the consequences of the 
accident at the Chernobyl AES. 
  The Derzhatomnahlyad [State Committee on Nuclear Power 
Oversight] cannot provide for or ensure the execution of 
measures regarding the modernization of existing AES units or 
put new power units into operation because--in accordance with 
the Government's decrees--it is a regulatory and oversight organ 
in the sphere of utilizing nuclear power. What we need is more 
detailed study and grounds for justifying the possibility of 
putting another power unit of the Chernobyl AES into operation 
in 1995. 
  We must likewise take into account the fact that any 
decisions regarding the introduction of new power units at 
existing AES's and the organization of new enterprises for 
processing uranium can be adopted only after appropriate expert 
opinions have been rendered and reconciled with the regulatory 
and monitoring organs. 
  There are several other observations to be made with regard 
to the above-mentioned Edict. Therefore, taking into 
consideration the factors cited by us here, we request that you 
rescind this Edict and send it back for further work and 
reconciliation by the departments concerned. 
  [Signed] H. Hotovchyts, Ukrainian Ministry for Protection of 
the Population from the Aftermath of Chernobyl

  [Text] 
  [Panov] You and I have known each other for a long time, 
since 1974--when you came to work at the Technical 
Administration of the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy and 
Electrification. And later all I heard about you concerned your 
precipitous upward flight to the country's highest echelon of 
power--the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of 
Ministers. 
  [Kopchynskyy] I started out at the Physics Institute of the 
Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences, then I moved to the Ministry 
of Energy and Electrification, and in 1976 I was sent to the 
Chernobyl AES, at first in the post of deputy chief engineer for 
scientific matters, and then--for operations. I took part in the 
start-up of the first units there. Then I worked for three years 
as director of the Smolensk AES, and in 1983 I was transferred 
to the post of chief of the Nuclear Power Engineering Sector 
under the Department of Heavy Industry and Power Engineering 
within the CPSU Central Committee. After M. Gorbachev did away 
with the sectorial departments within the CPSU Central 
Committee, I moved over to the post of chief of the Department 
of Nuclear Power Engineering and Industry under the USSR Council 
of Ministers. My sphere of competence there encompassed all the 
facilities engaged in nuclear power engineering, including the 
gigantic centers of the USSR Ministry of Medium Machine Building 
and the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1991 I returned to Kiev. 
This decision took a long time to ripen within me, but with the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union made it final. 
  [Panov] Did you know about the activity of the "Greens" in 
Ukraine? 
  [Kopchynskyy] I certainly did. This was one of the reasons 
why I began to devote more time and effort to studying safety 
problems at AES's. The principal reason was, of course, the 
Chernobyl catastrophe, as well as the continued, conscious 
yearning to develop nuclear power construction at any price. If 
you recall, even after the Chernobyl disaster and the shutting 
down of the Crimean, Odessa, and Kharkov AES's, the people at 
the State Plan insisted on a figure of 36 million kilowatts of 
nuclear capacity in Ukraine. A group of scientists at the 
Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences headed up by B. Paton 
requested that this figure be lowered to 28 million; whereas the 
"Greens" insisted on a moratorium. The then deputy chairman of 
the Ukrainian SSR Council of Ministers, V. Hladush, the minister 
of energy and electrification, V. Sklyarov, and I endeavored to 
persuade the people at the State Plan that it could not ignore 
public opinion and that this could lead to unforeseen 
consequences. Unfortunately, most of the highly placed persons 
in Moscow failed to understand this; they behaved incorrectly in 
their relations with people, and this simply caused an outcry. 
The habit of a command style, secrecy, and a certain conscious 
exclusivity could not be overcome even by Chernobyl. Nobody 
wanted to consciously acknowledge that the nuclear power people 
were to blame for Chernobyl and that exerting pressure on public 
opinion had no future prospects. 
  [Panov] Today the president of Ukraine has signed an Edict 
on 
the development of nuclear power engineering without a public 
discussion on the matter; it even bears the designation "Not for 
Press Release." Doesn't it seem to you that this is a return to 
the old days?.... 
  [Kopchynskyy] I don't think that this was done on the 
president's initiative. More likely it was activated by certain 
departmental structures with the active support of certain 
officials from the apparatus of the Cabinet of Ministers. But as 
to a return to the old days, this situation certainly is very 
reminiscent of the pre-perestroyka period, when safety problems 
were put on the back burner. What was put on the front burner 
was kilowatt-hours. Come on, come on, let's have more and 
more.... There was a demand for increasing capacity no matter 
what the price. And this tendency is now manifesting itself in 
Ukraine--all nuclear matters are to be gathered into one pair of 
hands, everything kept behind a curtain of secrecy, decisions 
made without coordination or reconciliation with specialists and 
with the general public. I have observed this tendency over the 
course of a year, and the decision with regard to Chernobyl was 
a serious argument for submitting my resignation. 
  [Panov] It's a well-known fact that construction of the 
Chernobyl AES was carried out at an intensive pace: The builders 
were hounded, and the units had to be started up as soon as 
possible. And so how do you assess the quality of this 
construction? 
  [Kopchynskyy] Of course, there were problems, but the 
quality 
of the construction at the Chernobyl AES was far from ranking 
last in comparison with certain other nuclear power stations. 
The construction chief, A. Klyzyma, was a wonderful leader, and 
V. Bryukhanov was a high-principled director; he was not afraid 
to argue with his superiors. But the RBMK [uranium-graphite, 
heterogenous, single-loop, boiling-water reactor] units 
themselves were too heavy from the viewpoint of physics, 
thermohydraulics, and dynamics. The construction of the safety 
systems in the design of these facilities was inferior. The 
safety and control systems were solved in an academically 
incorrect manner. On the whole, the level of safety standards 
here in our country is significantly lower than in the West. 
Nowhere abroad is there such a cavalier-type attitude toward the 
positive effect of the capacity to react in a timely and 
eficient manner as there is in our country. 
  [Panov] But how did it happen that--when the Supreme Council 
adopted the decision to lift the moratorium and continue 
operations at the Chernobyl AES--there were essentially no 
opponents, nor was there a principled approach to this matter on 
the part of the Derzhatomnahlyad? 
  [Kopchynskyy] The fact of the matter was that we were not 
even forewarned that such a decision was about to be taken, and 
at the previous session of the Supreme Council Presidium nobody 
spoke except for Derzhatom. Neither the Derzhatomnahlyad, nor 
the Ministry of Environmental Protection, nor the Ministry of 
Health. There was a tendency.... And at the session of the 
Supreme Council itself nobody was interested in listening to 
opponents. There was a clamor, and that was all there was to it. 
  We submitted several notes to the Cabinet of Ministers and 
to 
the president in which we expressed our opinion. It boiled down 
to this: During the wintertime maximum utilization of power it 
was impossible to shut Chernobyl down, but after the winter this 
must be done. It should be done gradually, as other, alternative 
capacities come on line. But when the motion was made to revive 
Unit No. 2 at the Chernobyl AES, this became utterly 
incomprehensible. Why was it necessary to do so? This unit is an 
old one, and the safety systems are insufficient. Furthermore, 
we have no problems of power-generating capacities at present. 
There is no need for additional electric power because the 
economy is in a state of crisis. All this attests to the fact 
that what is a work here is a consciously extered pressure; the 
government is returning to its old-time procedures. 
  [Panov] Heorhiy Oleksiyovych, here in Kiev you held a solid 
post as first deputy chief of the Derzhatomnahlyad. Just what 
was it--after all--that made you leave it? 
  [Kopchynskyy] That's a long story, Anatoliy Mykhaylovych, 
and 
quite a complicated one. When the USSR Derzhatomnahlyad was 
created in 1984, there were many obstacles from various 
quarters. We had to struggle and to prove that such a committee 
was necessary. Because, you know, prior to this there had been 
only departmental monitoring controls; the attitude toward the 
problems of nuclear safety was--to put it mildly--cavalierish. I 
was badly bruised along this path and was frequently in 
conflict-type situations. Then the Chernobyl catastrophe 
occurred, and after that--after the initial shock had worn 
off--the leading officials of the Union-level departments again 
manifested the same old tendency to belittle safety problems; it 
became evident that there was a return to the old ways. I 
decided to move to Ukraine and to attempt to accomplish 
something here. The chief of the Ukrainian Derzhatomnahlyad, M. 
Shetynberg, and I reached a mutual understanding, and we set to 
work. We prepared draft laws on radiation protection and the use 
of nuclear power, a program for building up the infrastructure 
of nuclear power engineering, a whole series of normative 
documents, and various proposals regarding the modernization 
reconstruction of AES's. In time, however, it became obvious 
that the Government leaders had begun to look askance in our 
direction; they were beginning to express the thought that the 
main thing for Ukraine nowadays was to survive. It was evident 
that that the organ for the state regulation of safety at AES's 
was becoming a burden for these leaders. We ceased to be invited 
to deliberations where the fate of nuclear power engineering was 
being decided. All our endeavors to create a safety system based 
on world approaches evoked active opposition from the 
government. The final straw in this matter was the decision to 
continue operations at the Chernobyl AES. I decided that I had 
had enough. I don't want to remain in a 1986-type situation 
anymore. I went through a great deal that year, superhuman 
pressure--psychological, physical, and moral. I was hounded by 
the following thoughts: What had happened and why? What must be 
done to make sure that such things do not happen again?... 
  I don't want to remain anymore in such a situation. I don't 
wish to be in the Ukrainian Derzhatomnahlyad if all the 
decisions are being made without it, if these decisions 
contradict that concept of safety which should prevail in 
Ukraine--a country where the greatest technical-type catastrophe 
in the history of humankind occurred. 
  We must be ensured and re-ensured against any such 
catastrophes. Nuclear power engineering does not have the right 
to exist if it is unsafe for people's lives. 
  I don't want to bear responsibility for the Supreme Council 
and the Government of Ukraine. Therefore, I decided to leave. 
  I have never maintained that nuclear power engineering is 
completely unnecessary. But I am categorically opposed to a lack 
of responsibility and and a conscious lack of principles on the 
part of the departments concerned.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Chernyak, doctor of economic sciences, </F>
professor: "Privatization or Collectivization?"] 
  [Text] It is impossible to find a single method of 
privatization for all enterprises. As world experience 
indicates, it is necessary to designate various groups of 
enterprises and apply different methods to them. Everywhere that 
privatization has occurred, a combination of forms took place. 
State property is privatized through vouchers, redemption, and 
auctions. In Ukraine it is planned to conduct privatization 
principally (or even exclusively) with the certificate method. 
Are we going our own way? 
  Privatization can be conducted by the direct method (for 
cash 
and credit resources) and with vouchers (coupons, 
certificates)--free of charge, or at a low price (as in the 
Czech Republic). It must be noted that privatization that is 
free of charge is not such a simple and easy solution, as some 
naively think. It accelerates privatization, but it produces 
less significant results, for it does not attract additional 
capital, it diffuses stocks, and it complicates the management 
of property. 
  Large enterprises are privatized by means of vouchers. 
Poland's experience indicates that the best method of 
privatizing large enterprises is their transformation into 
joint-stock companies and the sale of stock on the securities 
market. 
  Small-scale privatization in the Czech Republic, Poland, and 
Hungary was carried out through auctions of stores, restaurants, 
dining halls, hotels, and workshops. It is fundamental that the 
center initiated small-scale privatization, but it was 
implemented by regional organs. 
  Public auctions were the main method of small-scale 
privatization, and large-scale privatization--open conversion to 
joint-stock companies. Those who want to buy propose 
privatization projects. A competition of projects occurs, whose 
criteria of evaluation are quality and availability of financial 
support. Obviously, large-scale privatization in Ukraine without 
large investment funds and foreign capital is unrealistic. On 
the other hand, if privatized enterprises do not operate 
successfully, then a crash of privatized funds is inevitable, 
inasmuch as they will not be able to pay dividends. 
  As world practice shows, the privileges of a labor 
collective 
in the process of privatization are unsuitable. In the Czech 
Republic no one received special privileges. The trade unions 
demanded special rights for the labor collectives, and even 
threatened to go on strike, but no privileges were given to 
labor collectives. The only thing the workers received was 
credit for the purchase of enterprises on condition of a 
high-quality privatization project. The Ukrainian model of 
privatization envisions privileges for the labor collective and 
managers of enterprises. Are we again taking another path? 
  World privatization experience indicates that the redemption 
of an enterprise by a labor collective is not feasible and 
ineffective. It is not privatization "in the true sense of the 
word." In Chile enterprises were privatized through redemption 
by a labor collective, but they went bankrupt, and the state 
bought them out and subsequently privatized them. In enterprises 
that are redeemed by a collective, as a rule, innovations and 
investments are lacking, and the predominant part of profits 
goes to the wage fund... It is not difficult to forecast that if 
we take the path of a transfer of enterprises to labor 
collectives, the problem of bankruptcy and re-privatization will 
inevitably arise. 
  Ukraine is implementing privatization by means of 
pre-privatization measures; i.e., it is taking not a direct but 
a roundabout path. Moreover, pre-privatization measures are 
treated as privatization intentionally or through 
misunderstanding. Commercialization, incorporation, leasing, 
closed conversion to a joint-stock company, and redemption by a 
labor collective are still not privatization but a complex of 
pre-privatization measures. The stock of a closed joint-stock 
company cannot be sold--it is not liquid. If there is no right 
of ownership to a part of property--this means that there is no 
private property. What is occurring in Ukraine is 
collectivization, not privatization. 
  The opinion exists that the only possible and strictly 
Ukrainian path of privatization is leasing. What can be said in 
this regard? Leasing property is not excluded, but it should be 
associated with a search for investors. In our country, leasing 
hampers privatization. Leasing is destatization in the framework 
of state property, and it can only be discussed within the 
framework of pre-privatization measures. The lease contract 
expires the day of full privatization. The privileges of the 
leasing collective consist only in the fact that it knows its 
enterprise well and that it can propose the kind of 
privatization project that will win in a competition. 
  In many countries a serious problem of privatization 
crediting exists. Credits for those who desire to take part in 
privatization are extended by commercial banks. Without a bank 
reference, it is impossible to take part in an auction or 
competition of projects. In the Czech Republic, 10 percent (40 
billion krona) of the total sum of credit resources of the 
country were allocated under privatization. Ukraine does not 
have any real credit resources, and its most severe problem is 
lack of capital. In this connection, the creation and 
development of a credit resources market and a securities market 
is of vitally important significance. 
  In the process of privatization, the search for a real 
property owner and a strategic investor who proposes a strategic 
plan for development of an enterprise and finances is of 
decisive significance. Investment banks, funds and companies, 
insurance funds, joint-stock companies, and physical persons 
perform the role of such an investor. A majority of enterprises 
of Ukraine are not competitively capable, in connection with 
which it is necessary to make capital investments. A strong 
investor is needed who will invest resources and improve the 
financial situation. In our country commercial banks most of all 
could be such investors. 
  It must be clearly realized: Without a resolution of the 
question of the strategic investor, privatization in Ukraine 
will be reduced to collectivization.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pavel Petrenko, chief specialist of the </F>
Department of Foreign Economic Relations of the Cabinet of 
Ministers of Ukraine, conducted by Volodymyr Oleynik; place and 
date not given: "Ukraine Will Have No Luck in the Economic Union 
in the Form in Which It Exists Today"] 
  [Text] In connection with the session of the newly 
elected Supreme Council of Ukraine and the election claims on 
the office of president of the state, the question of the 
expediency of Ukraine's participation in the CIS Economic Union 
has been overshadowed somewhat. But unfortunately so since, as 
specialists believe, Ukraine could lose in it more than it finds. 
  Well, judge for yourselves. We offer for your attention 
our correspondent's interview with Pavel Petrenko, chief 
specialist of the Department of Foreign Economic Relations of 
the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. 
  [Oleynik] So Ukraine is an associate member of the CIS 
Economic Union. May it be hoped that many problems of economic 
disintegration will now be overcome more successfully? 
  [Petrenko] If we attempt to avoid emotions and operate only 
with facts and intellect based on strict economic realities, the 
situation is defined as follows. The development of the CIS 
Economic Union in the interests of all its participants, as the 
treaty declares, will depend primarily on the possibilities and 
readiness for cooperation of the participants, first and 
foremost on the national systems of the management of foreign 
economic relations. 
  An analysis of the treaty testifies that the majority of its 
articles do not, to put it mildly, coincide with the interests 
of the people of Ukraine. In the legal respect, for example, the 
treaty is not adjusted and requires an enormous amount of 
supplementary exegesis and clarification. This state of affairs 
automatically enables one of the strongest parties to the treaty 
to immediately avail itself of these lacunae, which promise 
Ukraine nothing but losses. 
  The rights and obligations of Ukraine in the treaty are not 
balanced or weighed. It is not at all clear how Ukraine's banks 
will participate in the shaping of currency-financial and 
banking legislation of the Economic Union. It may be forecast 
even now, therefore, that realization of the treaty will 
undoubtedly have ambiguous consequences for Ukraine and its 
trading partners not only on a CIS scale. This applies primarily 
to the spheres of the so-called "four freedoms" which were 
determined by the Treaty of Rome of the countries of the 
European Union: free movement of goods, services, manpower, and 
capital. 
  [Oleynik] Does it not seem to you that realization of the 
terms of the treaty in the deformed space of the CIS, hopelessly 
backward in the legal and technical-economic respect and not 
even remotely reminiscent of the former Union space, is simply 
unrealistic? 
  [Petrenko] I am sure it is, unfortunately. The preamble to 
the treaty even speaks of the formation and development of a 
common economic space. And an attempt is made even to decipher 
these terms. 
  Article 3, say, specifies the free movement of goods, a 
coordinated tax, price, foreign economic, and customs policy, 
and the harmonized economic legislation of the Contracting 
Parties. But what is meant by this free movement of goods, 
primarily for Ukraine? If we are guided by the treaty, Ukraine 
is required to provide for the unimpeded transit across its 
territory of goods from the customs territories of other 
countries of the Economic Union or any third country. That is, 
Ukraine will once again be left with precious little, as it was 
in the times of the USSR. 
  Free trade does not, incidentally, prevent the importation 
into Ukraine of commodities exerting a negative influence on its 
environment. No provision is made together with the abolition of 
tariff and nontariff regulation and the lowering and elimination 
of duty, taxes, and charges for the preservation of 
quota-determination for commodity imports and exports. For 
Ukraine such a state of affairs--Viktor Pynzenyk is absolutely 
right here, incidentally--is unequivocally disadvantageous 
inasmuch as it has a negative balance of payments with Russia. 
  [Oleynik] The treaty provides for concerted tariffs on 
materials-handling operations. As experts maintain, it is in 
fact a question of regulation of the rate of profit of Ukrainian 
transport enterprises. They note the improper formulation of the 
question of the parties' "common customs tariff" and the 
"coordination of the participants' foreign economic trade." 
  [Petrenko] The disastrous consequences for Ukraine, as an 
independent subject of foreign economic activity which is only 
just attempting to plug its national economy into the system of 
the world economy, are obvious in this respect. If we keep to 
the letter of the treaty, the doors to the market of European 
states will be closed even more tightly to Ukraine. And, believe 
me, we will be guaranteed technical and technological 
backwardness even longer. 
  According to Article 7, the parties "will pursue a 
coordinated policy in the sphere of the development of transport 
and communications geared to the efficient transportation of 
freight." It is a question, of course, of freight that is 
shipped via Ukraine. It is reasonable to ask: Why is particular 
emphasis being put (for the umpteenth time) on the transport 
system? The answer lies right there on the surface--thanks to 
exploitation of Ukraine's transport systems and enterprises and 
the elimination of taxes and charges on freight (Articles 5 and 
6) that is conveyed across our borders, the parties to the 
treaty will strengthen the economy of their states at our 
expense. 
  And what price the explanations in Article 9 to the effect 
that the parties "will undertake without mutual concordance 
unilateral actions of a noneconomic nature to restrict access to 
their markets." How is the term "of a noneconomic nature" to be 
qualified? Economics, just like nature, does not have things 
that are purely independent of something or other or of 
consequences. Who has computed what restricted access to CIS 
markets of its rolled metal and machine-building and chemical 
products would cost Ukraine? Thus Ukraine is on the one hand a 
subscriber to the treaty, on the other, sanctions of a 
"noneconomic nature," which would inevitably entail not only 
financial but also social difficulties, could be applied to it. 
  [Oleynik] How are we, from the viewpoint of an independent 
state, to understand Article 13, which says that "...The Parties 
will coordinate their investment policy... in sectors of mutual 
interest." 
  [Petrenko] We could agree to this were we to forget that the 
imperial system of management in Ukraine bled the national 
economy white, leaving us a deformed structure of industry. But 
we would then have to forget about the main assignment of the 
current and prospective development of the economy of Ukraine--a 
reorganization of its economic structure for the needs of the 
populace. 
  Articles 14 and 15 speak of the creation of an interstate 
free trade association, according to which the Ukrainian 
currency would belong to a multi-currency system, and the 
Russian ruble would be detached as something intermediate 
between multi- and mono-currency systems. We are talking about 
the formation of a currency union which is to provide for mutual 
settlements based on a common (reserve) currency. It is not hard 
to foresee that the functioning of the currency union will 
ensure only the stability of the ruble, and the national 
currencies of the other states will be working concertedly for 
the accomplishment of the goals identified by the "ruble" 
currency union. 
  And Article 16 proposes the creation of a payments union, 
which would provide for payments in the national currencies via 
multilateral clearing in the Interstate Bank of the CIS. This 
union is intended for the achievement of the full convertibility 
of the currencies as integration processes intensify and would 
necessarily be transformed into a unified currency system. It is 
clear even to the nonspecialist that we are talking about the 
restoration of the Soviet settlements system. 
  [Oleynik] But perhaps these are, indeed, merely proposals? 
  [Petrenko] An analysis of the treaty testifies that the 
ultimate goal of the Economic Union is gradual deprivation of 
the independent states first of economic, then of political 
levers. The proposed methods and principles of the formation of 
a currency and monetary system among the states of the CIS are 
not news, incidentally. They existed at the time of the Council 
for Economic Mutual Assistance, but in this case the authors of 
the treaty took account of the CEMA omissions. The mechanism of 
mutual settlements and influence on the economy of the 
participants in the CIS Economic Union which has been created 
blocks as much as possible the structural reorganization of 
Ukraine. This is evident from the content of Articles 17 and 18, 
which "guarantee" for the Ukrainian currency a Procrustean bed 
until such time as the Russian ruble becomes fully convertible. 
Only after this, if we have not lost the state by this time, 
will it be possible to commence structural transformations of 
the economy, but this will be many times harder to do than now. 
  [Oleynik] And what will guarantee the standardization of the 
tax system of the participants in the Economic Union, which 
presupposes a common mechanism of taxes and tax rates? 
  [Petrenko] Harmonization of tax policy based on a unity of 
methodology of consideration of production costs is required of 
the parties to the treaty. Article 29 proposes for this the 
creation of common executive and coordinating institutions. What 
does this mean? That we have, in fact, to give up our own tax 
system, which is essential for strengthening our economy, and 
hand over the planning of all processes of economic life to 
supra-state executive and coordinating institutions. 
  In addition, the Economic Union specifies that within the 
framework of the treaty the leadership of the states' foreign 
economic relations shall be exercised by a discrete organ of 
administration. It should be expected that it will in time be 
accorded the functions of central organ of planning of the CIS 
states in the sphere of foreign economic activity. The 
performance of the said functions will inevitably entail the 
creation of a vast bureaucracy, and a great deal of money will 
be spent on this. At the same time, on the other hand, Russia 
has thus far blocked all questions concerning the shareout of 
assets earned together, the gold and currency reserves, the 
Black Sea Fleet, and such. 
  Thus the Economic Council in the form in which it exists 
today and in which Ukraine has already agreed to participate 
with associate-member status will accomplish the intentions of 
the neo-allies and deliver a crushing blow to the sovereignty of 
Ukraine. Following which it will take us a long time to approach 
even today's level of political and economic independence.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Ryaboshapka: "Reconciling Wages With </F>
Profits"] 
  [Text] As of today, the main tax for production 
enterprises is the income tax, which enterprise directors do not 
like. Usually countries with a market economy have a tax on 
profits. In ratifying the Law on Taxation of Income, the Supreme 
Council took into consideration the fact that over the period 
the Law on Taxation of Profits was effective in Ukraine, our 
businessmen understated profits, converting them to wages. 
  Would it not be more advisable to introduce in Ukraine, 
instead of a tax on income, a tax on profits? Such a step would 
be more advantageous both for foreign investors and for many of 
our country's enterprises--primarily state enterprises, which 
specialize in the production of traditionally labor-intensive 
output. Today they are forced to pay higher taxes on income than 
enterprises whose production output does not relate to 
labor-intensive sectors. Enterprises of the coal and metallurgy 
industries therefore find themselves in an unfavorable 
situation, while those of light industry (where wages comprise a 
significantly lower proportion of the producer cost structure 
than in the above-mentioned sectors) are in a more favorable 
situation. If we shift to a system of taxation of profits, all 
enterprises will then be operating under the same conditions. 
Bearing in mind Ukraine's experience with the effects of this 
method of taxation in 1992, however, it is necessary to 
introduce a new method and mechanism for collecting this tax. 
  Thanks to studies conducted over the course of 25 years 
(from 
1965 through 1990) on the problem of the machine-building 
complex of Ukraine, the following rule was discovered: There 
exists a stable, approximately 1:1 ratio between wages and 
profits in this sector. The ratio is a bit different in other 
sectors, but it is also stable, the wages being less and the 
profits more. Under our present-day conditions, it would be 
advisable for all sectors to have the ratio between wages and 
profits on the level of 1:1. Such a ratio has existed over the 
course of decades in countries of the market economy of Europe 
and the United States. It is based on the fact that 
simultaneously characteristic of human labor are the output of a 
necessary product (wages) and a supplemental product (profits). 
Based on the constancy of this ratio, therefore, we may 
introduce the following method of establishing a tax on the 
profits of enterprises of all forms of ownership and the 
mechanism for withholding it. When an enterprise receives from 
the bank, let us say, 1 billion karbovantsy in cash for the 
payment of wages, the bank must immediately remove 350 million 
karbovantsy as tax on profits from the settlement account of 
this enterprise and deposit it into the budget, to the 
appropriate account of the Ministry of Finance--this under the 
condition that the norm for tax on profits is 35 percent. 
  The proposed method of establishing the tax on profits and 
mechanism for withholding it has the following advantages: 
  it will be impossible to artificially understate profits, 
for 
if an enterprise attempts to do this, it will also have to lower 
its wage fund, which would be economically disadvantageous; 
  not a single production enterprise will be able to evade 
timely payment of the tax on profits, and the budget will 
receive tax revenues in timely fashion (this is the main 
advantage of the new method); 
  the method is strongly anti-inflationary; an enterprise will 
not be able to overstate its wage fund, for if it does so it 
will also have to increase the withholdings from its profits in 
the form of tax going to the budget; 
  enterprises will be interested in augmenting their noncash 
accounts and in taking cash out of the banks only for wages, for 
if they take out cash for other purposes, 35 percent of the 
amount will have to be paid as tax all the same; 
  the tax inspectorate will be able to focus its attention on 
the withholding of taxes from those enterprises that are 
involved mainly in cash transactions, i.e., with trade 
enterprises, while taxes will be collected from production 
enterprises at the banks.

<F P=106> [Article by Olga Musafirova under the rubric "Cast of </F>
Characters": "Let the Acting Prime Minister Be a Lesson to 
Others] 
  [Text] The press media knew rather little about Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy last year. He is the fattest deputy of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Soviet. Smokes a lot. Looks rather gloomy. He used to 
work in Donetsk as the manager of two right-flank coal mines. He 
was there for 22 years plus 15 more; therefore, he has the right 
to tell anyone where to go and how far. He addresses his 
audience as "Dear Comrades." His political views are in full 
agreement with his age and position. 
  His arrival in the Cabinet of Ministers was preceded by a 
powerful wave of rumors. Zvyahilskyy's career in the government 
was linked to the onset ("he instigated it!") of the miners' 
strike in the fall of 1993, as well as to its more or less 
successful ending ("he bought them off, he buttered them up!") 
The chair of the first deputy prime minister in Kiev, which he 
occupied after a brief term as mayor of Donetsk, was rumored to 
have strong legs. It was alleged that certain forces faced the 
president with a choice: Either Zvyahilskyy gets nearer to 
power, or else... 
  The next stage, his move into the office of Leonid Kuchma 
with all his belongings, was described by oral folklore in a 
style even more picturesque. It seems that Leonid Makarovich 
summoned Yukhym Leonidovich into his room and said: There is an 
opinion that you have to work as a Kuchma. But the latter was in 
no hurry to thank him for the confidence and he answered 
pensively: "I am rich, you see. My family is well-off; my 
children, grandchildren, and grandchildren's children will all 
have enough. But if the people of Ukraine are pleading..." 
Nobody tried to disprove the rumors because Zvyahilskyy did not 
grant any interviews or hold any press conferences. Ever. As a 
matter of principle. (Not quite, however. Quite recently the 
weekly ROSSIYA prepared a whole package of positively tinted 
materials in which a conversation with the acting prime minister 
took central place.) 
  A note of distinction. The Ukrainian press media would 
normally start to lambaste previous prime ministers somewhere 
halfway through their fruitful activity. First, there would be 
voluminous interviews "with hopes for the best," and only by the 
time of the final curtain would they openly say the same thing 
about each of them: "What a bastard--he has ruined it all!" 
  The years of training proved useful--they started to strip 
the acting minister down right away. Democratic publications 
started to find heaps of documents showing that Yukhym 
Leonidovich had something to do with some dubious crude oil 
deals. Using the opposition from the economy reformers' camp as 
the mouthpiece, the "moderate" were baring the totally 
unscientific essence of all measures taken by the government. 
For instance, the closing of the Interbank currency exchange or 
their stubborn refusal to free fixed dollar rates. The "petty 
Nazi" publications were insulted by the mere fact of an "alien" 
appearing at the very height of government power. The upset led 
them to poetry where Ukraine was up for a rhymed sale to the 
masons of the world by "Zvyahilskyy Fima, Soros, and Birshteyn." 
  This was why the appearance of Yukhym Zvyahilskyy before the 
UNIAN information agency, which invited a horde of people with 
dictaphones and TV cameras for the occasion, became a sensation 
in itself: "The sphinx" has spoken! 
  It soon became clear that Yukhym Leonidovich was a rather 
mediocre orator. He was also conspicuously uptight in an 
environment to which he was unaccustomed and he must have 
secretly cursed his counselor-aide with his impenetrable smile 
who had undertaken the task of creating his image. What the hell 
for, let me ask you? 
  Zvyahilskyy saddled his nose with a helpful pair glasses 
and, 
without any emotion, read his introductory statement which 
anybody else would have read to the accompaniment of a brass 
band. He was reporting on an elementary plan that was drafted 
six months before without any creative thought or economic 
imagination. To stop hyperinflation, to stop the unchecked flow 
of Ukraine-produced industrial goods out of the republic, to 
ensure hard currency returns from exports, "to squeeze" due 
taxes into the budget, to stop the energy crisis, to prevent a 
food crisis... A hard administrative hand was choking the thin 
little neck of the market economy. All this meant that nothing 
good could come out of this. However... 
  Inflation (married name "superhyperinflation") stood at 91 
percent last December, but for some reason dropped down to 19.2 
percent in January, 12.6 percent in February, and 5.7 percent in 
March, and showed a further tendency toward decline. These data 
were provided by the unemotional Ministry of Statistics, which 
would have been just as happy to please the ex-leaders... 
  The prices of most essential foods have practically not 
grown 
in the last six months. (The majority of people who have not 
gotten any wages since January could not care less, anyway.) But 
then they did not freeze (people, not prices) in winter as 
predicted, either at home or at work. Energy sources were 
somehow obtained. For the same reason, the spring sowing 
campaign, traditionally run on emotions, has already been 
competed for all practical purposes, according to Zvyahilskyy. 
Quietly and without losses. Producers were given direct loans 
for fuel, spares, and chemicals, contracts were signed for state 
purchases, the price of bread was set at 1,290,000 karbovantsi 
per tonne, and so far the villages have managed to survive 
without upheavals. 
  Zvyahilskyy closed the Interbank currency exchange, sort of 
outside of the plan but with all his heart. "Nobody will learn 
now how much currency was sold there in two years and to which 
enterprises--this is my official statement." The exchange was 
replaced by the Committee on Tenders, subordinate to the 
government. Now it is issuing special-purpose and controlled 
sums and yes, it is doing so according to the managerial 
principle "I give to whoever I find necessary." It issued 2.9 
billion Russian rubles to prepare nuclear power stations for 
winter, $500,000 to purchase rubber, 1.5 billion rubles to 
purchase coalmining equipment. 
  The acting prime minister was just as strict with the 
dollar, 
showing no reaction to the criticism of progressive economists. 
The "greenbacks" remained tied down by fixed rates. "They are 
forgetting that Ukraine imports 69.8 percent of its energy 
sources. If we free the rates, energy prices will skyrocket, 
followed by food and rent costs. The people will have no 
understanding for their government." 
  After that came the news of the season. In the nearest 
future 
the government and the National bank of Ukraine will prohibit 
any circulation of foreign currency on its territory. Like 
Russia did. This will be the artillery onslaught before the 
introduction of hryvnya. 
  His glasses were already lying on the side, together with 
his 
notes, his image, and the nasty word "macroeconomics." He 
bluntly refused to talk about his opinion of Kuchma, Kravchuk, 
or his leanings in the presidential campaign and politics in 
general. "I am an industrialist." But at the same time he 
described with gusto his recent meeting with the Crimean prime 
minister, "Comrade Saburov," which ended constructively for both 
of them, and he also mentioned his scheduled trip to Simferopol 
to "Comrade Meshkov." 
  The "political industrialist" seemed to have used the only 
way to work he really knew, his 37 years of experience managing 
coal mines. Namely, he did not bother his superiors by worrying 
about which superstructure, "socialist" or "capitalist," would 
grow on his basis: The bosses know better. He assigned reliable 
people to the localities, not necessarily in top positions. He 
did not criticize the "top brass" (as a blessing, now he has 
very few of those) and he ignored all criticism from below and 
from aside. He did not ask for anything, including additional 
powers, because he knew he himself could get all he needed. It 
turned out that Ukraine, as one big mine which was well-worked, 
explosive, and stoked up by strike committees, could still 
produce coal. It could even rise in its steep downfall. The 
practical intellect of Zvyahilskyy caught this moment and used 
it. "The board of honors" did not interest him. 
  The headline of this article is flawed, from a grammatical 
point of view. According to the rules, it ought to be replaced. 
  In theory, it would be nice and prestigious to have a prime 
minister with the brains and looks of Lanovyy. With the charm 
and political instinct of Kuchma. With the progressive 
tendencies and ability to work of Pynzenyk. This would be an 
ideal sample! Top quality. Good enough for an exhibition. 
  But this one is good for work...

<F P=106> [Article by Mikola Shelyagovich: "The Republic before </F>
Presidential Elections"] 
  [Text] First the minister of internal affairs and the 
chairman of the KGB, who dared to be willful, were discharged, 
then speaker Stanislav Shushkevich was removed from his position 
and Myacheslaw Hryb became the head of parliament. After a 
three-year marathon a new Constitution of the Republic of 
Belarus was adopted. And on 15 March the constitution went into 
effect. 
  The desperate attempt at opposition by the Belarusian 
People's Front (BNF) and others of this ilk, as was expected, 
was not crowned with success. Moreover, it clearly demonstrated 
the impotence of the Belarusian national-radicals, who in this 
way decreased their political rating to an extremely low point. 
  The attempt of the BNF and the strike committees that they 
encouraged to bring out the workers of Minsk plants onto the 
square on cold February days remained just that--an attempt. At 
the same time the Supreme Soviet, which finally came to believe 
in its own legitimacy, found a way of overcoming the problem of 
a quorum--a vote was taken by name ballot in the course of three 
days. The vote was on whether or not to be a presidential 
republic. As a result, more than two-thirds of the deputy corps 
came out for a strong presidential authority. 
  Members of the BNF opposition in the Supreme Soviet, as 
could 
be expected, did not take part in the voting by name 
ballot--they, who not very long ago worked for a presidential 
form of government, today, when their ratings are falling, are 
categorically against a strong president. In alliance with them 
in nonacceptance of the presidency, and their most powerful 
opponent, was Sergey Gaydukevich--the leader of the People's 
Movement of Belarus (NDB), which unites within its ranks members 
of 25 republic parties, movements, and organizations. He, 
claiming in perspective to the first role in the republic, also 
understands that today is not yet his time! Nevertheless, a 
faction of the NDB in parliament (and this, according to a data 
list, has more than 100 persons) almost entirely voted for the 
introduction of the post of president. This fact showed 
eloquently that the most powerful and influential in parliament, 
and probably in the republic as well, remains as before the 
unofficial "party of the Council of Ministers," whose first 
authority is Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. 
  A month and a half remain before the election of the 
president of the republic. Named among the candidates are 
Premier Vyacheslaw Kebich, speaker of the Supreme Soviet 
Myacheslaw Hryb, the tireless fighter against Belarusian 
corruption, Aleksandr Lukashenko, yesterday's speaker, Stanislav 
Shushkevich, leader of the Party of National Accord, Gennadiy 
Karpenko, mayor of the city, and the nationalist and leader of 
the People's Front, Zyanon Paznyak. It is difficult to say which 
of them will be able to get the support of the powerful. One 
thing is clear: It will be a person who, after ending up in the 
position of president, will be managed by those whose authority 
he will personify and defend. Perhaps most likely a person who 
gets along with Kebich's team. 
  However, there is one "but." It is the support of the 
candidate for the president of Belarus on the part of Russia. 
Russia's game can significantly correct an election campaign 
that is predicted on the basis of internal factors: Moscow is 
interested in seeing in Minsk a rudder of authority that is 
"eastern" in orientation, so that Belarus will at no time become 
a real foreign state for Russia. 
  At the beginning of the integration process of the two 
Slavic 
countries, Moscow was visited first by representatives of the 
government of the republic--to coordinate the positions of the 
agreement on the unification of monetary systems, then by a 
delegation of the opposition headed by Zyanon Paznyak, who in 
many ways seems to be supported by Yegor Gaydar, and later by an 
NDB delegation that was received hospitably in Russia's State 
Duma. All these visits to Moscow were followed by attempts by 
Belarusian politicians to go through a preliminary political 
"inspection of a prospective bride" for "an older brother." 
  It is quite probable that Russia's sluggishness on the 
question of a real unification of monetary systems can be 
prolonged if not to the end then at least until the beginning of 
the presidential elections in Belarus. It is quite likely that 
by that time Russia will also clarify its position regarding its 
protege for the post of president of the neighboring country, 
which is extremely dependent on it economically and financially. 
But in order that Belarus not forget its dependence on its 
eastern neighbor, it was given a good reminder when Russia 
publicly announced that it was stopping deliveries of gas to the 
republic until debts are repaid. The debts were hurriedly paid 
in several days. 
  At the same time, political activeness in the republic can 
be 
seen with the naked eye. And it is not only the capital that is 
active. In western Belarus, where the bulk of the citizens of 
the republic who are of Polish nationality live, the Polish 
Democratic Party was established and operates actively under the 
influence of the Union of Poles. 
  In western Polesye, with the very active participation of 
activists of the sociocultural association Polisyse, a network 
of electoral associations has been established in the form of 
the regional sociopolitical organizations Brest Choice-94, Pinsk 
Choice-94, etc., whose staff has been joined by the most 
prestigious industrialists, bankers, entrepreneurs, and 
intelligentsia of the region. 
  In Vitebsk Oblast the Russian-directed Slavic Council Party 
Belaya Rus is announcing itself more and more actively, and the 
main forces and structures of the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Belarus--the native sister of the Russian party of 
Zhirinovskiy--are located in the Gomel region. 
  As for the old parties--the Social-Democratic Gromada, the 
NDPB [National Democratic Party of Belarus], the Christian 
Party, the Party of National Accord--they are undergoing a 
crisis. A majority of them were unable to leave the asphalt of 
Minsk and go to the periphery. The former alliance with the BNF 
also left the imprint of nationalism on them, which today is 
extremely unpopular among the people and which was promoted by 
BNF announcements that promised, in the event the BNF came to 
power, to introduce a law concerning the ban on professions, and 
to build Belarus as a national Belarusian state, etc. 
  Entirely possible is a variant in which the sociopolitical 
structures of the Belarus regions that carry unquestionable 
weight there unite in behalf of their common success and attempt 
to bring out their own candidate for president, especially if 
this candidate is not from the old clan and finds mutual 
understanding with the Russians. 
  But the fact that the oblast principle of distribution of 
power in the republic still has force was also shown by the 
elections of two new deputy chairmen (until now only a first 
deputy has been elected) of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic 
of Belarus. The candidates for the posts of deputies were not 
considered in political parliamentary factions but in oblast 
deputy groups. 
  As a result: The speaker of the parliament, Hryb, is a 
representative of the Vitebsk region, his first deputy is from 
Minsk, and the other two are from the Gomel region and the Brest 
region respectively. 
  However, such a balanced division of the republic's power, 
in 
the opinion of Belarusian political scientists, is a guarantee 
of preservation of the integrity of the republic.

<F P=106> [Article by Larisa Sayenko: "The Future President of </F>
Belarus?"; first paragraph is introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] Few people doubt that Vyacheslav Kebich will be the 
first President of Byelorussia. What will this election entail? 
  The Vyacheslav Kebich's entourage zealously proves that the 
advent of the current prime minister to the presidential post is 
inevitable, and there is no alternative to him. Several teams 
can compete on equal grounds in great Russian, though somewhat 
differing in programs but having equal strength. But, 
Byelorussia hardly scraped up one membership of the Council of 
Ministers. 
  Probably, this also may explain the first place held by 
Vyacheslav Kebich in the political hierarchy of Byelorussia. 
This is a team man, a company. In the past, a man of party 
"clip," who did not try to show off his intelligence. He is 
winning people's favor first of all by his sociableness and 
simplicity. A rare deputy who has not asked credits on easy 
terms, a batch of cheap refrigerators or trucks, a flat or a car 
for himself. Vyacheslav Frantsevich is generous not only towards 
his associates but also offers his political opponents whatever 
help he can. 
  Vyacheslav Kebich is a business manager, rather than a 
politician. He won his "first" popularity as director of the 
machine-tool works. The promising organizer was sent by the 
party to a backward enterprise, which he managed to place among 
the foremost in the socialist emulation. He was the first among 
business managers in the capital to recognize such a bourgeois 
novelty as sociology, providing sociologists with full freedom 
for any polls. It is noteworthy that with absolutely anonymous 
questioning the director of the plant received a very high 
rating of the majority. 
  Vyacheslav Kebich was always distinguished for business 
activity and the ability to get on with people. Everything seems 
to indicate that he has kept these qualities even today. The 
head of the government, addressing the national intelligentsia 
and convincing them that he places above everything else the 
independence of his country, and the head of government who made 
a report to leading industrialists and assured them that he is 
building a confederation with Russia -- is one and the same man, 
Vyacheslav Frantsevich Kebich. He is equally ready for both, 
depending on the circumstances and the situation. 
  MN File 
  In the republic, Vyacheslav Kebich mainly relies on the 
scientific-industrial association that unites the leading 
economic executives and entrepreneurs, as well as the 
pro-communist popular movement of Belarus. He has a major lobby 
in the parliament. On the eve of the election campaign, this 
lobby enabled him to remove his rival Stanislav Shushkevich 
without any problems. What's more, the prime minister called the 
campaign against him "kitchen squabble" and did not allow 
himself to make any attacks on his opponent, even in 
retaliation. In the course of a single day he collected 70 votes 
in the Supreme Soviet needed for his nomination as a candidate 
for presidency, and in one week -- about 150,000 votes of 
ordinary electors. 
  The awakening of the Byelorussian premier's national 
self-consciousness which took place a year and a half ago, most 
likely may be explained by the tough pragmatic policy of Yegor 
Gaidar's government regarding the fraternal republic: inflating 
the fuels prices, ultimatum demands to pay the debt right up to 
switching off oil-and-gas supplies for a lengthy period. 
  On the other hand, the present craving for Slav unity is 
nothing but a calculation on an amicable shifting off of 
economic burdens on the shoulders of Viktor Chernomyrdin's 
government. The psychological compatibility of the two premiers 
has more than once helped Belarus out of seemingly hopeless 
situations -- with the same enormous non-payments to Russia's 
Gazprom. The question arises: how compatible are the economic 
models of the two states and is Vyacheslav Kebich going to 
accept the tough financial-credit terms of the Russian side or 
hope to prolong Byelorussian socialism at the expense of Russia? 
  Vyacheslav Kebich was greatly impressed by the outcome of 
the 
latest Russian elections. In Minsk they were assessed as the 
alienation of the broad masses from the market-economic reforms. 
Large-scale restoration of socialism started, in the form of 
distributing advantageous credits, allowances, impressive 
increment of pensions, minimum wages. From the beginning of the 
year this thricely devaluated the Byelorussian "zaichik."* 
  It is hard to suspect the prime minister of not knowing the 
real price of such reforms. But the election marathon calls for 
sacrifices. 
  Let's take, for example, bread. Belarus is importing wheat. 
By spring, Kazakhstan's grain had run out at the bakeries and 
the grain for hard currency flowed from Europe. The retail 
prices of rolls and buns from wheat, officially called "free," 
automatically rose more than two-fold, sparking off the 
discontent of the population. Knowing for sure the objective 
need for the price rise, Vyacheslav Kebich instantly responded 
live on TV, explaining everything by the arbitrariness of 
certain officials and promising to punish them. Indeed, he found 
the "guilty" and punished, even if with official reprimands, and 
restored the previous prices. The subsidy from the budget 
remained in the shade. It was allocated for making long loafs 
cheaper -- 49 billion only for one month. The Finance Minister 
Stepan Yanchuk was compelled to state that the "unplanned growth 
of state subsidies on some types of food, housing, communal and 
transport services resulted in the exhaustion of the annual 
limit of the budget deficit today." 
  MN File 
  According to the Council of Ministers, during the first 
quarter the gross domestic product and payments to the budget 
went down by 40%. The drop came closer to the limits which 
dictate "the minimum necessary production volume to ensure the 
minimal requirements of the state." The number of unprofitable 
enterprises trebled. The average monthly inflation came to 
50%. 
The Cabinet of Ministers sees the way out in rough vertical 
management, selective backing of enterprises and collective 
farms, in centralized regulation and, no doubt, in monetary and 
economic unification with the Russian Federation. The team of 
Vyacheslav Kebich reveals full unanimity. A special stand is 
taken only by Stanislav Bogdankevich, Chairman of the National 
Bank, and Finance Minister Stepan Yanchuk, who nurse no 
illusions regarding unification and suggest the introduction of 
market-economy mechanisms. This is explained not so much by 
personal qualities, as by objective circumstances: the financial 
system of the republic is coming closer to failure. 
  At the meeting with war and labour veterans, when Vyacheslav 
Kebich was accused of the disintegration of the economy, he 
parried: "Just name me an ex-USSR republic where the life of 
people is better?" As a result of debates the representatives of 
the older generation unanimously backed up the candidature of 
the prime minister for the post of the President. There is a 
great deal of truth in what Kebich says. He did not overlook 
control over industry, at a time when becoming a head of the 
government, about 50% of the industrial potential was in 
republican subordination. Social security spreads not only to 
old men and children, but practically to all of the able-bodied 
population. Not a single bankrupt enterprise has been shut down, 
the giant plants standing idle pay rather impressive wages "or, 
to be more exact -- allowances." 
  The favorite leisure of the prime minister is angling. The 
recently economic reports of the prime minister are increasingly 
reminding of anglers' stories. From time to time Vyacheslav 
Frantsevich assures that the economic situation is improving. 
And from the autumn of 1993 the most successful catch is the 
idea of economic union with Russia. Today Vyacheslav Kebich 
maintains: "The creation of a single ruble zone is the aim of my 
whole life." As though his life has not passed in that ruble 
zone. Was it that long ago at a press conference regarding the 
introduction of "zaichiki," that the prime minister tried to 
convince people that Byelorussian and Russian rubles are 
absolutely equal, but shortly "zaichik" will outweigh and "one 
Russian ruble will be equal to 60-70 Byelorussian kopeks." 
Meanwhile, the widely-advertised abolition of the customs duty 
on raw materials and fuels in the Russian Federation from May 1 
did not produce the desired effect. Instead of the customs duty 
Russia introduced an excise tax which did not improve the 
situation in the republic. 
  Vyacheslav Kebich must be done justice. Initially the 
conditions of the Byelorussian-Russian financial-economic union 
really promised a number of advantages to the Byelorussian side 
and could really become a ring-buoy. But the methods in "the 
settlement of issues," polished throughout years, began to 
malfunction in bilateral relations. The most sober-minded 
supporters of Kebich believe that it is quite in vain that he 
has become stuck so strongly to this idea, actually becoming a 
hostage of the Russian authorities. The hearty attitude of 
Viktor Chernomyrdin may be balanced by the cool attitude of 
Boris Yeltsin: unlike Stanislav Shushkevich, the Byelorussian 
prime minister was not in a hurry to express his support to the 
President in the critical moments of his confrontation with the 
legislative power. 
  Vyacheslav Kebich is a pragmatic business manager, and this 
undoubtedly does him credit at the post he occupies. Quite 
timely he parted with the communist party "on moral and ethical" 
considerations -- after the August coup. In Byelorussia he 
kisses the hand of the Metropolitan Filaret, in Israel wears a 
skull-cap, in the Arab Emirates would surely accept a Muslim 
ritual under guaranteed supplies of cheap oil. But the 
impression lately taking shape is that the sense of realism is 
leaving the prime minister. He is beginning to believe in his 
promises, making too big a stake in the political game with 
Russia. 
  As to his personal qualities, Vyacheslav Kebich on the post 
of President would guarantee the absence of sharp changes in 
keeping to traditions (as an ideal prototype for the 
Byelorussian President he considers Pyotr Masherov, leader of 
the Communist Party, rather popular even today). But in case of 
unification with Russia the economic levers of management will 
be passed over to Moscow which will hardly back up Byelorussian 
socialism. If the agreement fails, then the economic situation, 
undermined by the election campaign of the prime minister, will 
inevitably lead to the worsening of living standards and will 
call for unpopular tough measures and a corresponding leader for 
their implementation. 
  MN File 
  Vyacheslav Kebich is a Byelorussian. He was born in 
Volozhin District in 1936. Finishing school with a gold medal, 
he enrolled in the Byelorussian Polytechnic Institute. In 1958 
he became a business manager as a rank-and-file engineer at the 
plant of automatic transfer lines, covering the road to one of 
its leaders. At the age of 40, he became general manager of the 
Kirov machine-tool works, at the same time heading its design 
office. In 1980, he was promoted to party work: Second Secretary 
of the Minsk City Committee of the Communist Party of 
Byelorussia and head of the department of the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of Byelorussia; Second Secretary of the 
Minsk Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia. 
He also headed the republican Committee for Economic Planning. 
Since April 1994, he has been Chairman of the Council of 
Ministers, and one of the most realistic aspirants for the post 
of the first President of the Republic of Belarus. 
  He is married and has two children. The members of his 
family were mentioned in the materials on the parliamentary 
anti-corruption commission. However, the Procurator's Office did 
not find any facts of the crime in their actions. 
  * The Byelorussian national currency depicts various 
animals (including a hare on the one-ruble note), therefore 
among the people, Byelorussian money is called "zaichik."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Official Chronicle" column: </F>
"Augmenting the National Army--A Matter of Primary Importance"] 
  [Text] On 13 May in the Republic of Armenia there was a 
conference devoted to questions of organizing the spring 
recruitment. Participating in it were state ministers, 
ministers, Defense Ministry and Internal Affairs Ministry 
workers, managers from the procuracy, military commissars, 
chairmen of ispolkoms [executive committees] of the Yerevan city 
and rayon councils, and also through conference 
calls--representatives of ispolkoms of city and oblast councils 
of the republic. 
  Opening the conference, Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan 
emphasized the importance of the recruitment in the matter of 
reinforcement of the national army and defense of the country 
under the conditions of the continuing conflict in the region. 
The prime minister noted the need for both extensive explanatory 
work and the creation of a certain military-patriotic atmosphere 
by the mass media, on the one hand, and, on the other, a refusal 
to put up with draft dodgers and deserters and the application 
of punitive measures against them within the framework of 
existing legislation. In this connection Grant Bagratyan 
reported that by a government decree the republic procuracy was 
asked to file criminal cases in keeping with the established 
procedure against citizens who evade the draft and to take 
measures to return to Armenia draftees who are outside the 
republic. The corresponding instructions were also given to the 
ministries and departments. 
  Mr. Bagratyan also emphasized the need to ensure fairness 
and 
openness in the matter of conducting the draft and expressed the 
hope that, as a result of the hard work, the draft would go 
successfully. 
  State Minister Vazgen Sarkisyan talked about the problem of 
conducting the draft, introduced the members of the regional 
coordination commission, and addressed the tasks facing each 
rayon. The state minister condemned the bad system that exists 
whereby through fair means or foul every soldier is transferred 
to the military unit of their native region. The draft will be 
conducted according to a nonregional principle, he said, and 
nobody will serve in his own rayon. The state minister denied 
rumors that 18-year-old draftees would be sent to the border 
regions of combat activities and called them absurd. Describing 
the draft as a task of not simply republic but of national 
significance, Vazgen Sarkisyan emphasized the importance of 
universal support for this work, noting that it would be 
desirable for deputies of the Supreme Council and parties and 
public organizations to participate in it. The state minister 
said that work was being done in this area and there had been 
appreciable results. 
  A number of other issues related to the draft were also 
discussed at the conference.

<F P=106> [SNARK report: "Measures Made Stricter"] </F>
  [Text] Measures against individuals evading the draft into 
active military service are becoming stricter in Armenia. 
According to a government decree signed a couple of days ago, 
from now on citizens of draft age will be allowed to leave the 
republic only with the appropriate note on their military 
identification card. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been instructed to 
submit 
proposals concerning the procedure for returning draft dodgers 
from other states. 
  At the same time certain economic sanctions and restrictions 
on draft dodgers and their families are being considered. 
  Additionally, the state minister for questions of defense, 
Vazgen Sarkisyan, speaking at a government conference, 
categorically denied the assertion that draftees would be sent 
immediately to the front lines, calling such rumors "absurd."

<F P=106> [Article by Armen Baghdasaryan: "Armenia-Karabakh: Who Is </F>
Helping Whom?" 
  [Text] As is known, the Armenian authorities have blamed 
the grave socioeconomic conditions in the republic mainly on the 
blockade and the Karabakh war. Indeed it is a known fact that 
war is "an expensive habit" and that any country at war, 
declared or undeclared, cannot seriously think about developing 
its economy. Naturally, the opposition occasionally tries to 
refute the government's explanations that the Karabakh war is 
the cause of the disastrous state of the economy. Thus, during 
the discussion of the republic's budget in the parliament, 
deputy Garnik Isagulyan came forth with a sensational statement 
that Karabakh sent to 2 and 1/2 more aid to Armenia during 1993 
than the other way around. During a conversation with us, Mr 
Isagulyan reaffirmed his charges and said that he can prove what 
he has alleged point by point. According to Mr Isagulyan the 
value of goods sent from Karabakh to Armenia totals 140 billion 
rubles, while those that went from Armenia to Karabakh are 
valued at 64 billion rubles. 
  In other words, war-weary Karabakh, one third of whose 
territory is completely devastated and whose entire male 
population is in military service, has a positive trade balance 
with Armenia. No one doubts that in peacetime Karabakh's exports 
can exceed its imports. It is also true that all of Karabakh's 
industrial enterprises, without exception, are operating today 
unlike those in Armenia. Even so, the charge that is being made 
in today's war conditions is unusual, to say the least, 
especially since Mr Isagulyan says that his figures include the 
military assistance that Armenia provides to Karabakh. However, 
as unusual as the charge may be, none of the government 
representatives have denied the deputy's allegations, perhaps 
because a full refutation of the charges would require the 
discussion of undesirable topics, such as Armenia's 
nonhumanitarian assistance or the goods that have been taken 
from the so-called occupied territories. 
  Leonard Petrosyan, the head of Armenia's State 
Administration 
for Special Programs, described Mr Isagulyan's charges as 
ludicrous and pointed out that Armenia pays for 90 percent of 
Nagorno-Karabakh's budget deficit with interest-free loans. He 
said: "Armenia sends nearly 9,200 tonnes of flour each year to 
Karabakh, in addition to everything else. I cannot imagine what 
Karabakh can send back in return. It is true that one can bring 
from Karabakh, say, firewood, but that is so little that it may 
constitute perhaps 1 percent of what we send them. As for the 
alcoholic beverages that are brought from Karabakh, they cannot 
be consumed in Armenia because of their low quality. Armenia 
simply plays a transit role for those goods. Today, a minimum of 
15 trucks depart for Karabakh each day without counting the 
vehicles that carry specific cargoes. All these trucks return to 
Armenia empty because there is nothing to bring back. It is true 
that they may bring, for example, scrap metal, and work is under 
way in that direction." According to Mr Petrosyan, Karabakh has 
been exporting its surplus electricity to Armenia in recent 
months, but that it is improper to talk about that even 
qualitatively because 90 percent of the goods that are vitally 
needed in Karabakh are imported in one way or another from 
Armenia. He added: "Obviously, Karabakh would like to help 
Armenia economically, but it is superfluous to talk about that 
in the present conditions." 
  We were also able to contact Zhirayr Poghosyan, the deputy 
prime minister of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, who, it turned 
out, was aware of Mr Isagulyan's allegations. Mr Poghosyan said: 
"The first point is that Mr Isagulyan is far removed from 
economic structures and economics in general. It is true that 
Nagorno-Karabakh has very significant means, and in peaceful 
conditions we may be able to support ourselves and Armenia with 
our own products alone. But today most of Karabakh's land is not 
cultivated for known reasons. Karabakh imports from Armenia 
virtually everything. It exports, basically, shoes, marble 
slabs, electrical equipment, and so forth. In terms of numbers, 
one can say that Karabakh imports four times as much as it 
exports." 
  In general it is difficult to express any final opinion on 
this subject, because after all it is a matter of approach. One 
can take into account, for example, the fact that the equipment 
taken by Karabakh forces from the enemy is worth millions of 
dollars. One can take into account the fact that valuable 
equipment is occasionally ferried into Armenia over the 
Stepanakert-Goris road. After all, not everything in the 
relationship between Armenia and Karabakh can be counted with 
money. It is hard to think that a Karabakh at war can help 
Armenia economically. On the other hand, it appears that 
Karabakh's role in Armenia's economic difficulties is quite 
exaggerated.

<F P=106> [Article by Hakob Asatryan: "Forty-Eight Percent of </F>
Republic's Electrical Energy is Lost"] 
  [Text] "The government reports false figures in its 
programs," declared parliamentary deputy Arshak Sadoyan [at a 
meeting with reporters]. Representing the parliamentary group of 
the National Democratic Union [NDU], Sadoyan drew the attention 
of the reporters to the figures in the budget that was recently 
passed by the Supreme Council and demonstrated that they do not 
correspond to the truth. According to those figures, the monthly 
income of the average person in the republic was 254 dram in 
February 1994, indicating that it had grown by 15.4 times while 
consumer prices rose by 125.8 times [as published]. In other 
words, the living standards of the population declined by 
8-fold. In addition, according to the same budget, the gross 
national product of the republic must be 9.285 billion dram in 
1994, but the real figure is expected to reach 60.100 billion 
dram by the end of the year. In other words, the inflation rate 
is expected to be 6-fold (597 percent). Sadoyan claims, however, 
that if a more realistic approach is taken, the inflation rate 
will be 20-fold. He says that the government is distorting the 
figures so that it can hide the large difference between the 
1.7-fold growth in incomes and 20-fold increase in prices. 
  The remarks of Semyon Baghdasaryan, the other member of the 
NDU parliamentary group, about energy production were even more 
interesting. It has been determined that the electrical energy 
output of the republic declined by 2-fold from 11,270 million 
kilowatt-hours in the first 11 months of 1989 to 5,822 million 
kilowatt-hours in the corresponding period of 1993. On that 
basis, the supply of electricity to the population should have 
declined by 2-fold and not by 12-fold. 
  Thus, where has the electricity generated in the republic 
gone? In Mr Baghdasaryan's words, 48 percent of the electricity 
generated was lost in the transmission network alone, and 25 to 
30 percent was distributed through illegal or so-called "private 
supply" means. This assumes that 50 percent of the 305 million 
kilowatt-hours of electricity generated in November 1993 was 
delivered to the population and the remaining 50 percent was 
given to industry. According to Mr Baghdasaryan, because of this 
situation not only electrical energy but industrial production 
is lost. 
  Mr Baghdasaryan says: "Officials of the Ministry of the 
Interior derive personal benefit from the `private services' of 
supplying electricity." He noted that if this situation 
continues, the directors of substations may illegally privatize 
their units and decide on their own who receives electricity and 
who does not. 
  Parliamentary deputy Seyran Avagyan said that the harsh 
taxation system does not help the importation of high-priority 
foodstuffs into the republic. He said that today the minimum 
monthly expenses (bread, salt, sugar, heating oil and soap) of a 
family comprised of four members is 2,095 dram. Assuming that 
two members of the family work, each working person must 
therefore earn at least 1,047 dram a month at a time when the 
minimum monthly wage is 110 dram (176 dram beginning in April). 
The deputies then spoke about Armenia's domestic and foreign 
policies. In particular, Shavarsh Kocharyan declared that 
Armenia must look for strength in itself and rely less on 
outside forces.

Currency to Population Lifted"] 
  [Text] The republic government has issued a directive to 
remove restrictions on sales of foreign currency to physical 
persons. As is known, until now banks could sell up to $2,000 a 
year in hard currency only to persons traveling outside the 
republics on business, on tours, or on a visa, which created 
favorable conditions for the "black market" to flourish. 
  As an AZER-TADZH correspondent was told in the Cabinet of 
Ministers, the decision is aimed at strengthening control over 
cash in circulation and complete legalization of manat buying 
and selling for foreign currency. 
  There are currently more than 80 banks that perform these 
operations. In order to avoid the outflow of foreign currency 
from the republic, documents are in the works that would 
regulate it being taken outside Azerbaijan.

<F P=106> ["Speech of Republic of Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev </F>
at NATO Council Meeting in Brussels on 4 May 1994"] 
  [Text] Dear Mr. Deputy General Secretary, dear members of 
the NATO Council, dear ambassadors, ladies and gentlemen! 
  I thank you for the warm welcome you have extended to me and 
the Azerbaijan delegation. I am glad that I have the opportunity 
to be among you today, and I consider it an important event for 
the Republic of Azerbaijan. Thank you very much for the warm 
words of welcome and good wishes you have expressed toward the 
Republic of Azerbaijan. The people of Azerbaijan, having 
traveled a long historic road of development through numerous 
difficulties and obstacles, achieved national independence in 
1991. An independent state of Azerbaijan was formed, which now 
is a member of the United Nations, the CSCE, and many 
international organizations. I feel very proud today that the 
Azerbaijani delegation is present today in the headquarters of 
the North Atlantic alliance. 
  The Republic of Azerbaijan is following the road of 
strengthening its independence. In domestic policy it is 
pursuing the development of a democratic, law-based state, 
creating the conditions for individual freedom and the 
protection of human rights and for a multiparty system and 
political pluralism, guided by democratic values developed by 
humanity. In the economic sphere the republic is firmly on the 
road of implementing economic reforms and establishing a market 
economy, free entrepreneurship, and freedom of initiative. We 
believe that all this creates good preconditions for 
Azerbaijan's close integration in the world community. 
  In foreign policy the Republic of Azerbaijan acts on the 
premise of interconnection and interdependence in the world, 
conducts a peaceful policy, and strives to maintain good 
relations with all countries on the basis of the principles of 
respect for sovereignty and noninterference in each other's 
internal affairs, territorial integrity, and inviolability of 
borders. 
  The Republic of Azerbaijan is currently experiencing a 
serious economic crisis. It was caused, on one hand, by the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, of which Azerbaijan was part 
for 70 years, and the disruption of close integrated ties with 
all other republics of the Soviet Union, a transition from one 
economic system to another. On the other hand, this economic 
crisis is being deepened and exacerbated by the fact that 
Azerbaijan is in a state of war with the neighboring Republic of 
Armenia and is a target of military aggression. We believe, 
however, that all these difficulties can be overcome, keeping in 
mind that Azerbaijan has firmly taken the road of independent 
development. Azerbaijan's state independence is an irreversible 
factor, and we are convinced that the way we are going about 
state organizational development, economic transformation, and 
implementation of economic reforms will allow us to overcome 
these difficulties and make Azerbaijan, with its abundant 
resources and rich economic and intellectual potential, a part 
of the world economy and the world community. 
  As I have already mentioned, the difficulty of Azerbaijan's 
situation stems to a considerable extent from the fact that for 
six years already the republic has been the target of military 
aggression on the part of neighboring Armenia. This aggression, 
unleashed by nationalist circles in Armenia, has brought 
uncountable misfortunes to both the Azerbaijani and Armenian 
people, and represents a very difficult problem for us today. 
  You know very well that as a result of military aggression 
on 
the part of Armenia, which is pursuing the goal of annexing part 
of Azerbaijan's territory, of making Nagorno-Karabakh a part of 
Armenia, Armenian armed formations have occupied a considerable 
part of Azerbaijani territory. The six-year war has already 
resulted in the death of more than 20,000 people; about 4,000 
persons have been taken prisoner of war or hostage; thousands 
upon thousands of homes, hospitals, schools, social facilities, 
and industrial and agricultural enterprises on the territory of 
Azerbaijan have been destroyed. The estimated damage is in the 
billions of dollars. 
  The worst part, however, is that almost 20 percent of 
Azerbaijani territory occupied by Armenian armed formations, and 
the inhabitants of these regions--which is more than 1 million 
people--have lost their place of habitation, are in a most 
difficult socioeconomic situation, and are refugees in their own 
country. All persons of Azeri origin have been driven from the 
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh; as I said, Nagorno-Karabakh and 
seven regions of Azerbaijan adjacent to it are occupied by 
Armenian armed formations. 
  We have always taken, and continue to support, the position 
that the conflict should be resolved peacefully. We strive to 
actively use the facilities of international organizations: the 
United Nations, the CSCE and its Minsk Group. In 1993 the UN 
Security Council passed four resolutions that categorically 
demand the withdrawal of Armenian occupation troops from the 
territory of Azerbaijan, but none of these resolutions have been 
carried out by Armenia. The efforts of the CSCE Minsk Group also 
so far have not led to positive results. Military operations 
continue today; Armenian armed formations, having occupied, as I 
already said, a considerable part of Azerbaijani territory, are 
conducting an offensive on the Republic of Azerbaijan's defense 
positions. Blood is being spilled every day; people are dying. 
  This can no longer be tolerated. Therefore today I want to 
make use of my presence here, in the NATO headquarters, and 
state once again Azerbaijan's position. We are for a peaceful 
resolution of this issue, for an immediate cease-fire and 
suspension of all military operations, for negotiations that 
must result in the immediate withdrawal of occupation troops 
from the territory of Azerbaijan and at the same time ensure its 
territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders. On these 
terms we are willing to consider the issue of the status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh's autonomy. 
  Speaking on 12 April on Azerbaijani television and radio, I 
appealed to the Armenian people, Nagorno-Karabakh residents of 
Armenian origin--citizens of Azerbaijan--to stop this bloodshed. 
Fate has decided that the Azerbaijani and Armenian people will 
live next to one another, and they have lived next to one 
another for centuries. We believe that trying to resolve this 
problem by military means will lead us to a dead end; this war 
is hopeless, and we need to end the bloodshed as soon as 
possible and establish peace in our region. 
  Today we again express our confidence that international 
organizations, first and foremost the CSCE and the CSCE Minsk 
Group, will take additional steps to implement our peace 
initiatives. Today, in this NATO headquarters, I would like to 
express my deep respect for the North Atlantic alliance, which 
over the period of its existence has made a tremendous 
contribution to establishing stability in Europe and the entire 
world, to strengthening peace and cooperation. We have great 
respect for NATO and attach great importance to its activities 
at the current stage. The creation of the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council has become an important phase in NATO 
activities, which makes it possible to bring other states into 
the NATO orbit. 
  We have welcomed NATO's decision, announcing on 10 January 
of 
this year the adoption of the document Partnership for Peace, 
and consider it, too, an important step in NATO's activities in 
furthering the development of cooperation between countries. We 
attach great importance to the fact that NATO's 10 January 
decision expressed particular concern regarding the situation in 
our region, in the South Caucasus, and a conviction that the 
conflict in our region, particularly in Azerbaijan, Armenia, and 
Georgia, must be brought to an end. 
  All this is very desirable and interesting for us. Based on 
this, we welcome with great satisfaction the invitation extended 
by NATO to countries of East Europe and the new independent 
states, formerly parts of the Soviet Union, to sign the 
Partnership for Peace document. We have made a decision to sign 
it, and we pin great hopes on cooperation with NATO. For us it 
is also very important from the standpoint of Azerbaijan joining 
Western democracy and also because it will give us the ability, 
in cooperation with NATO, to look for additional ways to 
stabilize the situation in the region, stop the war, and 
establish peace and good-neighbor relations between Azerbaijan 
and Armenia. 
  These are the thoughts and hopes we brought here to you, and 
we are ready today to sign the Partnership for Peace program. I 
want to once again express a hope that this step on the part of 
the Republic of Azerbaijan will be properly appreciated by NATO, 
will bring mutual benefits, and most importantly, will 
contribute to stabilization of the situation in our region. I 
wish your organization further success. I thank you for your 
attention and am ready to sign the framework Partnership for 
Peace document.

<F P=106> ["Statement of His Excellency the President of the </F>
Azerbaijan Republic, Mr. Geydar Aliyev, at the Time of the 
Signing of the Partnership for Peace Framework Document (NATO 
Headquarters, Brussels, 4 May 1994)"] 
  [Text] The Azerbaijan Republic, having a rich history going 
back many centuries and having negotiated an enormous path of 
development, three years ago restored its national independence 
as a result of the collapse of Soviet totalitarianism and has 
today presented itself to NATO as a full member of the world 
community, being represented in the United Nations, the CSCE, 
and other international organizations. 
  At the present stage, considering today's regularities of 
world development, Azerbaijan, endeavoring to take its rightful 
place in the world community, is fully resolved to create a 
democratic society committed to the fundamental principles and 
values that have been expressed by human civilization at all 
stages of its development. 
  The bases of the official policy of Azerbaijan are a love of 
peace, political pluralism, and the recognition and assurance of 
individual liberty and human rights. Enforceable enactments on 
political parties, freedom of religious belief, protection of 
the rights of national minorities, and such have been adopted 
and are functioning here. 
  Azerbaijan builds its foreign policy on the basis of a 
profound recognition of the interdependence and interrelated 
nature of the world, proceeding from the common global purposes 
confronting all of us. We are firmly confident that the basis of 
security in the current period of challenges and threats is 
mutual respect for states' sovereignty and territorial integrity 
and the sanctity of their borders. 
  Azerbaijan has embarked on the implementation of economic 
reforms to create a market economy open to the outside world, 
which will make it possible to realize the country's wealth of 
potential. We are to this end implementing measures to attract 
foreign investments in the economy and establish cooperation 
with the world's biggest companies. A process of legislative 
backing for the reforms is under way. 
  Azerbaijan is today experiencing the profound crisis which 
has encompassed the entire territory of the former USSR and 
which is the result of the collapse of the Soviet system. 
Despite this, we are fully resolved to overcome the difficulties 
of the current stage and by way of the plan-oriented 
implementation of reforms to strive for the creation of a 
prosperous sovereign state. 
  In September 1993 Azerbaijan became a member of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, considering this an 
essential factor of political and economic cooperation with all 
the countries formed following the disintegration of the USSR, 
and signed the Collective Security Treaty. 
  My country's situation is made worse by the fact that it is 
being subjected to aggression on the part of neighboring 
Armenia, which has territorial claims on Azerbaijan. 
  Armenia, as the aggressor-state, is using the ethnic group 
of 
Armenians living on the territory of Azerbaijan's 
Nagorno-Karabakh region as an instrument of separatism for the 
annexation of our territory. Armenia is using its own territory 
and armed forces to wage war on the territory of Azerbaijan, and 
it can no longer conceal these facts. 
  In the course of the aggression perpetrated against 
Azerbaijan the Republic of Armenia has occupied more than 20 
percent of Azerbaijani territory. As a result of the ethnic 
purges carried out by the Armenian armed forces more than 20,000 
persons have been killed and approximately 60,000 have been 
wounded or have become disabled, 4,000 have been taken prisoner 
or hostage, and approximately 1 million Azerbaijanis have become 
refugees in their own country. 
  Under the threat of annihilation, absolutely all 
Azerbaijanis 
have been driven out of all the occupied territories. The forces 
of occupation are employing scorched-earth tactics. 
Approximately 90,000 residential structures, more than 1,000 
economic facilities, 250 schools and educational institutions, 
and 250 medical establishments have been burned, looted, and 
destroyed. The damage caused Azerbaijan is put at billions of 
dollars. 
  Armenian nationalism ignited the torch of war and set 
against 
each other two peoples bound by the will of history to live in 
peace and good-neighborliness. I am profoundly convinced that 
the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia has no military 
solution. The continuation of the hostilities will bring both 
peoples incalculable misfortunes. It will prevent them getting 
back on their feet, establishing their independence, 
implementing economic reforms in full, and creating a democratic 
state. 
  Azerbaijan has always adopted a constructive position on 
questions of a settlement of the conflict. The territorial 
integrity and sanctity of the borders of our state are for us a 
fundamental principle. We will strive for the liberation of all 
occupied Azerbaijani territory and the return of all refugees to 
their land, the 50,000 Karabakh Azerbaijanis included. We will 
simultaneously undertake to ensure the security and all civil 
rights of the Karabakh Armenians and to afford them the 
appropriate level of autonomy within the framework of the 
Azerbaijani state. 
  On 12 April of this year I appealed to the citizens of 
Armenia and the inhabitants of Nagorno-Karabakh of Armenian 
nationality--citizens of Azerbaijan--to stop and cease 
hostilities. The Azerbaijani state guaranteed all inhabitants of 
the conflict zone involved in the hostilities personal safety 
and the possibility of living freely and in peace on their 
native land. We once again today confirm this fundamental 
position of ours. 
  In the time of the military aggression against Azerbaijan, 
which has gone on for approximately six years now, many steps 
aimed at a peaceful settlement of the conflict, which, 
unfortunately, have yet to produce the desired results in view 
of the hard-line aggressive policy of the Republic of Armenia, 
have been taken. 
  The fact of the occupation of Azerbaijani territory and the 
demand for the immediate, full, and unconditional withdrawal 
therefrom of the Armenian armed forces of occupation have been 
reflected in four resolutions of the UN Security Council--822, 
853, 874, and 884. But on various pretexts Armenia is still 
refusing to comply with these resolutions. 
  Armenia is by its behavior openly challenging the world 
community, sapping at root all attempts at a peaceful political 
solution of the conflict by refusing to recognize the 
territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and to liberate occupied 
Azerbaijani territory. 
  The Azerbaijani Republic once again declares its readiness 
to 
solve all questions by way of peaceful negotiations within the 
framework of the CSCE Minsk Group, on the basis of the UN 
Charter and the principles of the CSCE. 
  The Azerbaijani Republic is, for its part, doing everything 
to support the actions of the Minsk Group and creating all 
possible conditions for it. But I would like to emphasize that 
each time that the Minsk Group assembles, the world witnesses a 
further escalation of hostilities on the part of Armenia and new 
seizures of Azerbaijani territory, as was the case at the time 
of the visit to the region of the current chairman of the CSCE 
in October 1993 or this April, when a meeting of the Minsk Group 
was held in Prague, and so forth. A delegation of the Minsk 
Group, which we rendered the utmost assistance, was in the 
region from 26 April through 2 May. If all the countries 
represented in the Minsk Group were to demonstrate the firm will 
to bring the bloody war to an end as quickly as possible and to 
embark on the restoration of peace, I am sure that success would 
be assured. Taking advantage, therefore, of my presence in NATO 
Headquarters in Brussels, I appeal to the North Atlantic 
alliance, of which all leading countries of the CSCE Minsk Group 
are members, for the adoption of the necessary effective 
measures to ensure peace and stability in our hemorrhaging 
region. 
  The Azerbaijani Republic has profound respect for the North 
Atlantic alliance and values highly its activity which has in 
recent decades secured peace, stability, and progressive 
development in Europe. At the present time NATO, as an actually 
functioning structure of collective security in the world, 
provides for the defense of democratic values and their spread 
to the new independent states which have formed in East Europe 
and on the territory of the former USSR. 
  We regard NATO as an organization which could help the young 
Azerbaijani state establish close multilateral relations with 
the Western world and become familiar with its wealth of 
experience. The strengthening of the independence of Azerbaijan, 
as, equally, of the other new European states also, would serve 
as practical confirmation of the permanency of the principles on 
which the entire activity of NATO is built. 
  We are grateful to NATO for its expression of concern at the 
situation in the Transcaucasus and its confirmation of its 
respect for the territorial integrity, independence, and 
sovereignty of the states of this region and, in particular, of 
Azerbaijan, which was expressed in the NATO Council declaration 
adopted in January 1994. 
  The principles of NATO, on the basis of which its 
participants regulate their relations, settle all disputes 
arising among them by peaceful means, and develop their 
individual and collective possibilities for warding off 
aggression against one or several members of this organization, 
have proven their viability over many years now and could be the 
foundation of the building of a new system of European security 
in the postconfrontation period. 
  The young Azerbaijani Republic, which has opted for the path 
of the building of an independent democratic state with a market 
economy, looks with great hope to the states that have scored 
big successes on this path and awaits help and assistance from 
them. For this reason we, like many other countries also, 
received with great enthusiasm NATO's Partnership for Peace 
initiative. The North Atlantic alliance is in itself for us a 
reference point thanks to the security which, as NATO General 
Secretary Manfred Woerner said on 10 January of this year at the 
meeting of heads of state and government of NATO members, it 
guarantees its members because this is the organization which is 
functioning the most efficiently in the sphere of collective 
security. 
  We, as a state that is in a state of war and subjected to 
aggression on the part of a neighboring country--Armenia, hope 
that participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program will 
enable us as quickly as possible to achieve a just peaceful 
settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, the liberation 
of the occupied Azerbaijani territory, and the elimination of 
all the consequences of the war. The high authority of NATO 
could be a telling factor in an end to this bloody war. 
  We hope that the Azerbaijan Republic's affiliation to the 
Partnership for Peace program will afford us an opportunity to 
stimulate our participation in the creation of a dependable 
system of collective security in Europe. 
  I believe that the democratic principles underlying the 
North 
Atlantic alliance will contribute to our successful cooperation, 
the practical removal of the obstacles that stand in the way of 
peace and stability in the Transcaucasus and other regions, and 
the progress and prosperity of all peoples.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Draft State Budget Sent to Parliament </F>
for Approval"] 
  [Text] According to the republic's deputy minister of 
finance, Fikret Yusifov, the income part of the budget assumes 
revenue of 138.4746 billion manats, and the expense 
part--181.3717 billion manats. Thus, the budget will have a 
deficit of 42.8971 billion manats. 
  F. Yusifov noted that such a large deficit is the result of 
a 
decline in the level of production, which has dropped 
several-fold as compared to 1992. In order to cover the deficit, 
the following steps are being planned, in particular: 
implementation of the state privatization program, which will 
help to earn 5 billion manats; changing prices for alcoholic 
beverages, which should bring 1.3 billion into the budget; 
raising prices for fuel and energy and bread; introducing 
value-added tax on imported goods, which will bring in 4.6 
billion over the remaining seven months; and so on. The deputy 
minister of finance also emphasized that raising the minimum 
wage from 900 to 2,000 manats is in the works, which will 
require additional budget expenditures. This difference is 
expected to be covered by raising retail prices on gasoline and 
the recently approved tax in the amount equal to two minimum 
wages on each square meter of space occupied by commercial trade 
and public catering entities. F. Yusifov said, however, that 
raising the minimum wage will only lead to another jump in 
market prices and in the final count an even greater decline in 
the population's living standard. As a KHABAR-SERVICE 
correspondent learned from competent sources in the republic 
government, three options for raising gasoline prices are now 
under consideration: 40, 50, and 60 manats per liter. Most 
likely the middle figure will be chosen, which will bring into 
the budget an additional 25-30 billion manats, but still will 
not be enough to raise the minimum wage.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: On Approving the Draft State Budget </F>
for the Entire Year"] 
  [Text] The National Assembly is planning to discuss the 
draft state budget for 1994. As Dzhumshud Nuriyev, the 
republic's deputy minister of agriculture and chairman of the 
parliament commission on budget control, told the ANS-PRESS 
agency, because of the high rate of inflation it is currently 
not expedient to approve a state budget for the entire year. 
Therefore, the plan is to approve at the upcoming session a 
draft state budget for the first half-year and to set target 
figures for the annual budget, which will then be considered and 
approved quarterly or monthly. Vakhid Akhundov, adviser to the 
Republic of Azerbaijan president on economic issues, shares this 
opinion. According to him, "Indicators in our country become 
outdated even before the ink dries."

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant Shakir Tair-ogly Salimov, deputy </F>
military commissar of the Kyapyazskiy Rayon Military 
Commissariat, by correspondent I. Guseynov; place and date not 
given: "...Answer to Your Conscience...."] 
  [Text] Azerbaijan is experiencing difficult times. 
Today it is very important for all the people, each resident of 
the republic, whether he be at the front or in the rear, to 
clearly understand the extreme nature of the situation, to be 
maximally mobilized, and to find his place in the sacred cause 
of defense of the Motherland. 
  The front and the rear are linked by a common destiny, 
a common task. The military commissariat of Kyapyazskiy Rayon of 
Ganje arranges its activity on this basis. This is the subject 
of the discussion between our correspondent and the deputy 
military commissar of the Kyapyazskiy Rayon Military 
Commissariat, Lieutenant Colonel Shakir Tair-ogly Salimov. 
  [Guseynov] How long have you been working in the military 
commissariat? 
  [Salimov] I have been here since November of last year. I 
was 
assigned here after I sustained a serious injury in battle for 
liberation of our native land from the Armenian scumbags. After 
graduating from the Novosibirsk Higher Military-Political School 
with a desire to join the airborne troops, I served in Germany 
and the Transbaykal and Siberian military districts. At the 
beginning of 1991 when the Armenian aggression was increasing I 
decided that my place was at the front, where the fate of my 
Motherland and my people was being decided. When I took the 
military oath I swore to be faithful to my Motherland until the 
end of my days. This oath and, above all, the sense of civic 
duty to my Motherland and family, who raised me and got me on my 
feet, forced me to return to Azerbaijan. I have been severely 
wounded in battle three times. The last time I lost a leg and 
that, one might say, put me out of commission for good and made 
it impossible for me to fight. And so I ended up here. If I had 
my way I would go back to the front today, to my comrades in 
arms. 
  [Guseynov] The regular draft into the National Army has 
ended. How did it go in your rayon? 
  [Salimov] Extremely badly. To be truthful, the mobilization 
we are conducting cannot stand up under any criticism. As a 
military person I must emphasize that today, when Azerbaijan is 
being subjected to aggression from our neighboring republic, the 
question of universal mobilization acquires primary 
significance. The whole problem is that when executing the order 
on mobilization in the majority of cases the edicts of the 
president of the republic and the Cabinet of Ministers are 
distorted. I am not saying this just to hear myself talk. After 
all, there are edicts to the effect that individuals who are the 
sole breadwinners for their parents are not subject to being 
drafted into the army, or a person whose brother is fighting at 
the front, or if one of his brothers has died at the front, and 
others are exempt from the draft. Why do we refuse to carry them 
out? 
  Understandably, a draft order, like all other military 
orders, is subject to strict obedience without discussion. But 
not at the expense of only sons. And how many of these chaps 
have already died and how many are fighting at the front today?! 
  [Guseynov] Comrade lieutenant colonel, it seems that only 
sons are a sore spot in your work. 
  [Salimov] Imagine that a worker of the law enforcement 
organs, say, in the precinct brings a young person of draft age 
to the military commissariat, knowing ahead of time that this is 
the only son of his parents, and he says nothing about it. By 
the time we sent him to the military unit his parents come with 
a paper from the housing operations section saying that he is 
their only son. But their son has already received his orders, 
he has entered the service, and now only an order from the 
Ministry of Defense can release him from further service. 
  [Guseynov] Shakir Mulladim, can it be that nobody other than 
only sons respond to the draft in the military commissariat of 
which you are in charge? 
  [Salimov] I think there are many draftees who are 
conscientious chaps who really understand their civic duty to 
the Motherland which is in danger. We have no problems with 
them. But there are also those who deliberately evade the draft 
and do not show up at the induction facility. And where should 
we look for them, and in general, is it the job of the military 
commissariat to look for people like this? And then "chaps" who 
are forced into the army exhibit cowardice at the front. 
  [Guseynov] Do you think that strengthening discipline is 
task 
number one in the army today? 
  [Salimov] Undoubtedly. At this time there is no task more 
important than that one. Without iron discipline the army is 
nothing but a wandering band of gypsies, but even there, 
incidentally, people obey the law. It is hard to admit it, but 
our army does not have enough discipline today. Otherwise, there 
would be no cases of desertion and absence without leave from 
the military unit. Have you never seen young men in military 
uniforms roaming around the city and in public places? Well, 
many of them are absent without leave from their million 
subdivisions. And I think that these cowards who have fled from 
the battlefield deserve the most severe punishment. 
  [Guseynov] Are there cases of desertion in your rayon, and 
what measures are being taken against such people? 
  [Salimov] I do not deny that we have had cases of desertion 
and absence without leave from the combat unit by certain of our 
draftees. But we are not authorized to take any measures against 
them. This falls within the jurisdiction of the military 
procuracy, which must hold all deserters strictly accountable. 
  [Guseynov] In your opinion, is there a solution to the 
problem? 
  [Salimov] Of course, there is nothing on this earth that 
cannot be corrected. Today every citizen of the republic must 
clearly understand that there is a war going on in our land; the 
Armenian aggressors want to take away part of our territory and 
they are encroaching on our sovereignty and independence. 
Finally, all of us must understand that today at the front and 
in the rear there is one common task--to drive the Armenian 
occupiers out of our native land. And all of our interests must 
be subordinate to this task. In the localities we must step up 
propaganda and agitation work; in the schools and VUZ's [higher 
educational institutions] we must improve military-patriotic 
work with youth, the level of which, unfortunately, leaves 
something to be desired. In the streets, squares, and public 
places it is a rare event to see patriotic posters and appeals 
for defense of the Motherland. And in the army itself we must 
overcome the existing psychology of complacency and 
insubordination to officers and junior commanders. Sometimes 
even a little bit of gratitude shown to a fighting man before 
formation cheers him up, raises his fighting spirit, and calls 
him to victory. It is very important to understand this. 
Finally, and this is the main thing, the actual time has come 
when we must answer to our conscience as to precisely what we 
have done for the front, for victory.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ilgonis Upmalis, Head of the Russian Troop </F>
Withdrawal Control Bureau, by Viktors Berzins: "Are They 
Leaving? -- Nothing Good There -- An Excuse for Contention Has 
Been Created."] 
  [Text] I LGONIS UPMALIS, Head of the Russian Troop 
Withdrawal Control Bureau answers questions from NEATKARIGA CINA. 
  [Berzins] Following the official initialing of the 
agreement, 
there has been a great deal of discussion about the demobilized 
Russian army personnel remaining in Latvia. Who are the people 
in this group, who will have the opportunity to remain here 
after the army leaves? 
  [Upmalis] One military unit was withdrawn from Latvia with 
the accompaniment of music. The very first one. For the rest, 
there has been no music, and no other military unit has been 
withdrawn. Property has been taken out, and the military units 
have disappeared. 
  There are three options for an officer, after the military 
unit is disbanded. 
  First -- there are those who sign a contract with Russia to 
continue service in the military. The drawback is that the 
signers cannot select where to serve. They must serve where they 
are sent. The majority desires to go to Moscow, but most will 
not be sent there. For this reason, a great many do not sign 
such contracts. 
  Second -- there are those who have sufficient service time 
to 
receive a pension when they demobilize. Those who have 
apartments in Russia will leave, and also those for whom 
apartments are being built. They have registered with Mayorov 
(Commander of the North Western Military Group), and will have 
apartments provided for them in Russia, in time. A few days ago, 
he showed me a list on which those were crossed off who had 
received apartments and had left. Those who have already entered 
into the Latvian community will not leave. 
  Third -- there are those, who, with the help of some arm 
twisting, have found the opportunity to serve in a comfortable 
little spot in Russia. All of these leave. 
  A fourth category consists of military persons who are 
non-commissioned officers. They are mid-ranking and warrant 
officers who had signed short-term re-enlistment contracts. They 
make up an entire category of the military, and these gentlemen 
have other problems, as well. Basically, they have been left on 
their own; they have completed their contact service stay, 
cannot yet receive a pension, and must provide for their own 
future subsistence. They are disappearing somewhere. 
  There is yet another category -- connected with the army 
were 
the so-called civilian workers, former Soviet military providers 
and workers. They did not walk around with epaulets. They may 
have even been Latvian citizens, although, for the most part, 
they were soldiers who had been released from active duty and 
who stayed to work. Every military unit was surrounded by these 
civilian workers. And, there is one more category that may 
increase the number of personnel remaining in Latvia. Mr. 
Mayorov has just submitted to me an official document on the 
number of retirees. There are 21,976 persons receiving pensions 
from the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation. Information 
is not forthcoming on the KGB retirees. 
  We had officially requested the listing a week ago. 
  [Berzins] Must we rely on the data supplied by the chief of 
the withdrawing military forces? Isn't there some way we can 
find this out ourselves? 
  [Upmalis] The municipalities are not doing well with respect 
to this matter. We had requested that, as of April 15, the 
municipalities, whose territories contained demobilized Russian 
military units, submit data regarding the retired military 
persons in their territory. The response is very poor. The only 
official data we have received up until now are from Rezekne, 
Jekabpils and the Vidzeme suburb. The rest are calling and 
complaining that they don't have any such data. As for example, 
Jurmala. But they have house management boards where such 
information could be obtained. -- That's a lot of work -- is the 
reply. While it is true that this a lot of work, these 
municipalities have the ability to gather the information. They 
have form No. 16, which shows who each person is. 
  The work is there, and it must be done. But, even more 
surprising than this laziness to perform the work is that we are 
concluding agreements with Russia without requesting such 
official information from them. That we are concluding 
agreements in the dark. We had no available information on the 
number of retirees, but we concluded an agreement on giving them 
public guarantees. 
  [Berzins] But those 22 thousand that are being mentioned 
constantly? 
  [Upmalis] I have not seen any official documents as of the 
present. To the best of my knowledge, the first official 
document is the one Mr. Mayorov presented to us on Tuesday. 
  And also. How many military persons there are in Latvia -- 
even this, no one has officially requested from Russia. 
  And if we are talking about demobilization as of February 
28, 
1992 and afterwards, we should know these figures. The office 
does not have these figures, and as far as I known, no one else 
does either. 
  [Berzins] Is it possible that the delegation is going around 
you, and that it already knows? 
  [Upmalis] For over one and a half years, I participated in 
the delegation as an expert. With the exception of the last two 
times, which were -- Jurmala and the signing in Moscow. Maybe 
then... But even in such a case, this figure should have been 
published. 
  [Berzins] So what is really happening -- is the Russian army 
leaving right now, or not? What about the orders to halt the 
withdrawal of the army, and all other threats of this type? 
  [Upmalis] There is only one way to answer this -- the army 
cannot not withdraw. This is because the army has reduced itself 
to a situation where, if it could remain here, it would have to 
bring the military forces back, bring in soldiers, bring in 
material reserves, technical equipment. Without these, no army 
can live or survive. 
  We are very strict in the control of all persons and 
military 
services being brought in. We are allowing military persons who 
are truly connected with the military withdrawal. Yes, we have 
admitted over 300 soldiers into the Cekule and Garkalns 
munitions storehouses, where they are packing munitions for 
removal. We look upon this as a necessity -- this is a 
workforce. This is also why it was possible to empty out the 
storehouses so quickly in Cekule -- some of the largest in 
Latvia. Right now, the area is being demined, and the work is 
being performed by the North Western Military Group. These 
storehouses will be taken over by the Latvian defense forces. 
  As for the other military persons -- and, naturally, we are 
talking about a large number -- the road here has been closed. 
One or two can get in -- our borders have quite a few gaps. You 
don't have to look far. They are entering right here through 
Riga airport, and, unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful in 
our attempts to have customs control aircraft coming from Russia. 
  [Berzins] Is this because the Russian side is prohibiting 
this by force, or are we just too afraid to do it? 
  [Upmalis] I believe the main reason is our disorganized 
structure. Three systems -- customs, border guards, and flight 
services -- must coordinate their activities. If they would get 
together and work properly, the problem would not exist. 
  The Russian military withdrawal process is occurring. At the 
end of this month, one more Latvian rayon will be free of 
Russian military forces. This is the Rezekne rayon, from which 
the last military unit is preparing for withdrawal. It is 
possible that, as early as this week, part of this territory can 
be taken over by our armed forces for border guarding needs. 
  Finally, the Biryuzov War School has been officially turned 
over. The same applies to the Alksnis War School. An airport in 
Daugavpils has been turned over. In Jekabpils, as well. A part 
of Bukultos is being turned over. In Oskalns station, a train is 
being filled from Zakamuiza -- a unit with about 60 various 
technical installations. 
  In the near future, a division will depart from Dobele to 
prepare a site in the Leningrad district for the relocation of 
this military unit. After a conversation with Mayorov, it could 
be gathered that the leadership is hoping to perform the 
withdrawal during the summer months. This is because barracks 
have not been built for all of the military forces, and 
therefore a portion will have to spend the winter in tents. This 
refers to both the Tallin 144th division and the Dobele 25th 
sharpshooters brigade. 
  [Berzins] People are upset that Latvia is preparing to pay 
for the properties built by the Russian army. 
  [Upmalis] While participating in the talks as an expert, I 
paid particular attention to a statement in the agreement that 
was worded as follows: the Latvian side guarantees reimbursing 
the Russian Federation for properties built by the army of the 
Russian Federation. Now, the Latvian side understands this 
statement as follows: Yeltsin proclaimed that this army became 
the Russian army after February 28, 1992. Thus, if anything was 
built after this date, then the Latvian side is prepared to pay 
for it. Unfortunately, I am unaware of any property that the 
Russian side may have built after this date. But Mr. Mayorov 
understands this matter in the same way as you did, that all 
property left behind will be paid for by the Latvian side. It 
has already been said that "property cannot continue to be 
turned over, because the property relationships have not been 
settled." 
  Thus, you can see what happens when the points of the accord 
between nations are not clearly defined. I already brought up 
the fact that such difficulties would arise, but the Latvian 
side interpreted this in a manner I already mentioned. 
  There is nothing good there -- an excuse for contention has 
been created.

<F P=106> [Article by Inara Egle: "Greens Must Not Change Color: The </F>
5th Congress of the Latvian Green Party Discussed Party Identity 
and Elected Leaders."] 
  [Text] One year ago, when tactics for the Saeima elections 
were being discussed during the Green Party Congress, Dzintars 
Abikis, while still a member of the party at that time, 
attempted to convince his colleagues that by running on a 
separate ballot the Greens could experience major 
disappointments in the Saeima elections. In theory, it turned 
out that he was right, but it seems that what was gained or lost 
cannot be easily evaluated. At the 5th Congress of the Latvian 
Green Party (LGP), which was held Saturday, the present day 
Latvian Way-"farer", Dzintars Abikis did not participate (this 
does not mean he was not mentioned -- in both a positive and 
critical light). After re-registration of the party members as a 
political organization, the number of united Greens has declined 
from approximately 300 to 128 members, which is not that 
significant, considering that many parties, even the more 
popular ones, are in the same situation at present, numerically 
speaking. But, just as last year, the main question for the 
Congress was how the Greens, without losing their identity, 
could save their ability to influence the process and defend 
their interests, which is only possible through government 
structures. 
  As we know, in the municipal elections, the Green party, in 
the majority of cases, is running together with the national 
forces, and even in the Riga council elections, it has joined 
the ballot with the Latvian National Independence Movement 
(LNIM), and the Greens have 11 seats there -- they did not even 
want any more. Latvian Green Party Co-Chairman Peteris Jansons 
said that the situation and the goals are different now, 
bringing the national political forces closer together. As far 
as we can remember, the union of national forces was formed 
primarily to support Latvian interests with respect to the 
citizenship law, and now it is also protesting against the 
initialed documents of the Latvian and Russian talks. And these 
are matters, as we learned at the Congress, that the Greens are 
entrusting to their coalition partners. 
  But the question concerns something else: by approaching and 
assimilating with other national forces, will the Greens lose 
the ability to voice their own principles in a sufficiently loud 
manner? This is also the concern of the longtime party 
Co-Chairman, Juris Zvirgzds, who reminded everyone that only and 
by itself can the Green Party create political security for all 
priorities related to its work and the environment. And 
therefore, two matters cannot be confused -- Greens do not join 
with nor enter into another political power, but, instead, they 
work together with it as an equal partner. "I am for working 
together according to the principle of partner relationships, 
but I am against the case where a Green changes colors or allows 
environmental questions to be postponed to another time, some 
time later. We know that `later' never comes", said Juris 
Zvirgzds. 
  Maybe there is no need to be afraid, because the partners, 
according to the assessment of Indulis Emsis, respect Greens 
precisely for their convictions, and have also studied their 
principles. But, for this same reason, according to Indulis 
Emsis, a "green line" must be defined, which, when it is crossed 
over, will cause the LGP to leave the partnership and drop out 
of the game. It should also be respected that the realization of 
Green ideas requires a long period of time, and therefore it is 
unnecessary to make exaggerated attempts at become a ruling 
political power, but rather, to focus on such politics that the 
Green standpoint is mentioned by all political forces, said 
Emsis. He also mentioned the party's financial situation, 
because it is no secret to anyone that influence in a power 
structure can be gained only by those parties who have money. 
Greens do not have money, but in looking for it, they should 
continue to be on the alert, because there are more than just a 
few who would be willing to provide financial support for the 
party, but only on the condition that it renounces the Green 
lines and principles in specific instances. 
  Even though the question -- of whether to go alone or 
together with others -- started some arguments, which, it seems, 
still remain unresolved, this did not, in any case, show signs 
of a split among the Greens. Maybe this was because there 
weren't that many of them -- not quite fifty. And maybe because, 
as Anna Seile concluded, this was a meeting hall where everyone 
could speak in a quiet tone, without microphones, and everyone 
understood and listened. And it is true that no calls to come to 
order were heard in the Green Congress, although when the 
candidates for party co-chairmen were proposed and 
characterized, an attendee summarized this process afterwards, 
asking: "Out of five angels, how can we select just three?" Yes, 
the Green Party still maintains the principle of electing, not 
one leader, but three co-chairmen to adopt their colleagues' 
resolutions, and so that the party is not called the Zvirgzds or 
Emsis party. This also has its minuses, which could be noticed 
also in the review period, because, since the functions are not 
precisely divided, it is also difficult to divide the 
responsibilities. It should be noted that none of these 
co-chairmen earn their living through being co-chairmen. 
  All three former party leaders -- Juris Zvirgzds, Olegs 
Batarevskis and Peteris Jansons -- were also nominated for the 
position this year. The bulletins also included the names of two 
more candidates -- the Environmental Protection Committee Vice 
President Pavils Raudonis, and Kuldiga rayon Council Chairman 
Janis Klavins. 
  Most votes in the Congress were received by the former party 
"prime mover", Juris Zvirgzds, head of the ecology laboratory at 
the Zoological Garden. Next was Janis Klavins, who could be 
considered as the surprise of this Congress. Klavins joined the 
party only one year ago, and ran as a Green candidate in the 
Saeima elections (in Kurzeme, as the very first). But the public 
began to notice Klavins when all attention was turned to 
Skrunda, which is in Janis Klavins led Kuldiga rayon. Like Olegs 
Batarevskis -- the third co-chairman -- he was born in 1951. O. 
Batarevskis works as State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice. 
The Central Council elected at the Congress will include Jekabs 
Raipulis, Leons Magelis, Inese Eihvalde, Indulis Emsis, Janis 
Baltvilks, Gunars Lakutis, Skaidrite Albertina, Pavils Raudonis 
and Karlis Gudermanis (Peteris Jansons withdrew his candidacy). 
  The delegates at the Congress also adopted one resolution, 
requesting the President of the nation to proclaim the first 
week of May as clean-up week. During this week, according to the 
document, "let's wash windows -- the eyes of Latvia, clean up 
courtyards and entryways."

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs at the University </F>
of Latvia, 14 April 1994: "Foreign Policy and Domestic Policy 
Aspects of Latvia's Security"] 
  [Text] I would like to start this address today with the 
thought that the foreign policy and domestic policy aspects of 
Latvia's security are a regional component of European security 
and stability. The importance of this theme is characterized not 
only by the increasing instability in the world and the 
countless possible causes of conflict, but also in the strongly 
emotional and politicized discussion in Latvia about the signing 
of the agreement between the Russian Federation and Latvia, 
about which there are many different views and arguments. 
  Whatever I say today, always bear in mind that Latvia's 
security may be and partly is a constituent and essential 
element of Europe's security and stability. That is the first 
position which is at the foundation of my deliberations. The 
second is a specific feature of Latvia, that is, that our 
foreign and domestic security are unusually closely connected. 
  My main emphasis will be on the political aspect of 
international security, not on its mechanism or its military 
component. In other words, the subject of this address is 
defining the cornerstone of Latvia's security and the discovery 
of the causes of insecurity, as well as determining our 
responses to the reaction to developments in the international 
situation. 
  That is why I, first of all, will talk about the practice of 
international politics at the end of the 20th century; secondly, 
I will examine Latvia's place in the New World Order; 
thirdly, I will characterize the basic dimensions of Latvia's 
foreign policy; fourthly, I will offer insights into the 
domestic aspects and coherence of Latvia's security. In 
conclusion we will evaluate the possible responses, actions and 
the consequences for Latvia of those or other actions. 
  The Practice of International Politics 
  For most of the Twentieth century, talk of a collective 
security system and a few real efforts to realize it were 
ignored, and precedence was given to doctrines of military 
security and corresponding applications of international power 
politics. Thus, in international practice the concepts of 
"security" and "national security" were used as synonyms for 
military security. To a certain extent that is understandable: 
Not only did confrontations occur involving the world's great 
powers and individual groups of states, but also an active 
struggle for the division and redivision of the world, expansion 
of spheres of influence, etc. The criteria for great power 
security and national security were chiefly oriented not toward 
domestic security, but actually toward averting potential 
threats to the sphere of influence and territory and satisfying 
hegemonistic national interests far beyond the state's borders. 
The best example for that is the realization of the USSR's 
interests in the Baltic states, the 1939 Ribbentrop-Molotov 
pact, the aggressive annexation of the Baltic states into the 
USSR in 1940. 
  It must be said that at the end of the Twentieth century the 
principles of European security have both changed essentially 
and have acquired new dimensions. Today, Europe turns its 
attention to the institutional dimensions to avoid crises and to 
reduce instability. That means that the goal of the 
international community is to achieve stable collective security 
with the intermediation of institutions so that their decisions 
can become meaningful. 
  Along with that the classical concept of guaranteed security 
has become old fashioned, and in its place as a guarantee comes 
participation in a collective security system. With that 
emphasis that Latvia's security is guaranteed in its own way by 
the fact of participation in the ECSC, ZASP [expansion not 
provided], the "Partnership for Peace" program or the Western 
European Union, for along with that we are becoming part of this 
process. The alternative to this sort of participation can only 
be isolation and remaining in a grey zone. 
  A plan to create a mutually inter-connected network of 
institutions in Europe was already planned in 1990, to provide 
the opportunity to use various crisis management systems, let's 
say political, economic or even cultural, and, to a lesser 
extent, military methods. This resolution came at the right time 
and the Eastern European countries gave the necessary support so 
that the transition process in those countries would not stop. 
  Realizing that the New World Order after the Cold 
War is characterized by disorder and countless possible causes 
of conflict, but that doctrines of security have taken on a new 
content, we may not return to the failures of the international 
system of the past, especially to those which followed the end 
of the First World War, when self-isolation and nationalistic 
principles of security took priority. 
  The ending of the Cold War's strictly fixed positions and 
along with that the time of easily modeled situation, and the 
time of rigid doctrine have also gone. The situation in the 
world, in Europe, and also around Latvia is developing very 
dynamically. 
  In the current circumstances obviously the most pragmatic 
approach to this question is to formulate clearly the basic 
orientation of Latvia's security policy and foreign policy, 
which, depending on the situation, permit us to choose solutions 
most appropriate to Latvia's interests. 
  Latvia in the New World Order 
  The Prime Minister, the Fifth Saeima of the Republic of 
Latvia, and the Cabinet of Ministers have come to the point of a 
significant decision, which is related to the Republic of 
Latvia's international and domestic interests. 
  The cornerstone of the contemporary dilemma is the draft 
agreement between the Republic of Latvia and the Russian 
Federation. To conclude the treaty, which is essential to 
Latvia, we would swear that we support the most significant 
post-war achievements in the international arena: international 
cooperation and integration. The importance of this event puts 
forth the demand to coordinate national political decisions with 
the still changing situation in international security. In this 
context I would like to remind you that the teamwork principle 
operates at both national and international. Such a team has 
already successfully developed within the context of Baltic 
cooperation, though Latvia still has not developed a national 
consensus and remains politically fragmented regarding 
acceptance of this critical decision. 
  The contemporary world may think that Latvia is too small to 
influence the events which develop the planet's political life. 
The world's great powers are paying increased attention to the 
conclusion of the Latvian-Russian agreement. Thus for the first 
time in the history of our country the opportunity is presented 
to Latvia to make an investment in the security and stability of 
Europe and the world. What, then, could this investment be? 
  First of all, a successful conclusion to our economic 
reforms 
has become significant also to the European security aggregate, 
for economic and security policy increasingly overlap. To ensure 
long-term stability, the development of the economic character 
will dominate over traditional security institutions. So, for 
example, while the European countries still give priority to 
NATO as a security organization, in the furture this priority 
could be given to the European Union/Western European Union 
institution, which in the longer term may be viewed as having 
greater potential. Latvia's cooperation agreement with the 
European Union and the status of members in the European Union 
must be understood as testimony to Europe's faith in Latvia, 
which calls for adequate steps in response. 
  Secondly, our foreign policy must be appropriate to the 
changing international situation. Of course in the realm of 
foreign policy, to prepare for the future one must have a 
long-term vision, which would give an insight into the level of 
capabilities, which is necessary to react appropriately to 
respective situations in the future. Only our foreign policy 
values system can guarantee that we do not find ourselves in the 
gray zone of European security. 
  In regard to this we must agree on the resources which must 
be devoted to supporting our doctrine in this area. To the RL 
[Republic of Latvia] that means full integration of diplomatic, 
economic, and military capability, which will in the aggregate 
sketch out our strategy in the area of security. 
  Thirdly, although we can view the intuitive logic of our 
values and our position as self-evident, we would not need to 
isolate ourselves from other views. The draft agreement on 
withdrawal of the army and the compromise on the Skrunda early 
warning system question is an example which attests to our value 
system being Europeanist. 
  Signing the agreement about the withdrawal of Russian armed 
forces from Latvia is the only real guarantee that the Russian 
armed forces will be withdrawn from Latvian territory by 31 
August 1994. In fixing the end date for the withdrawal of the 
Russian armed forces the likelihood of international controls 
over this process are greatly increased. Signing the agreement 
eliminates the possibility that the Skrunda early warning system 
radar will be left to exploitation, secondly, and permits this 
to begin immediately: The installation's most dangerous aspect, 
the disassembling of the parts. The Skrunda installation is 
found in Latvia's territory without a treaty which fixes the 
date when its operations will cease, which would mean not 
controlling this installation's functioning in Latvia for an 
undetermined period of time. The execution of the treaty will be 
controlled by a three-way commission which would include also 
ECSC representatives. ECSC control over execution of this 
agreement is not the only guarantee. It will also be ensured by 
Latvian participation in the the "Partnership for Peace" 
program. The agreement will enhance Latvia's opportunities to 
cooperate with the Western collective security systems, proving 
that Latvia is a politically mature country, which is able to 
carry the politics of compromise in the interests of both Latvia 
and also the international community. 
  By signing the agreement the Russian side undertakes a 
supplementary payment for the Skrunda early warning system radar 
being located in Latvia to compensate also the damage done to 
the surrounding environment, if that is established. 
  During his recent visit in Western Europe Latvia's President 
received international support to establish a special fund to 
eliminate the ecological costs of Skrunda and the dismantlement 
of the radar. The government issued an order to establish a 
special fund to finance the relocation of retired military 
personnel. 
  The agreement on Russian military retirees and their family 
members does not determine the status of these persons in the 
Republic of Latvia. That will be determined by Republic of 
Latvia legislation. 
  I acknowledge that these agreements include several 
difficult 
compromises for Latvia, but in my view there is no more 
important task than fixing the end point for withdrawal of 
Russia's armed forces, and with that achieving the withdrawal of 
this army from Latvia as quickly as possible. 
  Now, thanks to the initialed agreements, the so-called 
Yeltsin error and the activity of some part of the people (who 
easily manipulate, using historical analogies and ignorance of 
inter-connections), we acquire a surprisingly large opportunity 
to free ourselves not only from the army, but also from 
discharged military personnel, for we will never again have a 
real opportunity to actively draw in Western money to encourage 
implementation. If we lose this historic opportunity, then we 
could finally also lose our country, for I would not want to see 
a future of Latvian provincial decay in Russia's shadow. And if, 
by not signing the agreement, there is still an army in Latvia 
after 31 August, then they will all be the godsons of Grinblats, 
Kirsteins and Straume, for their care also remains here, which, 
permit me, depends on patriotism and an erroneous evaluation of 
the situation. How easily I could support the corps of critics 
of the agreement and I would do it if I did not see the 
inter-connectedness of the whole process. I would like to ask 
you and myself: Why is the opposition's view of the agreement 
the same both in Latvia and in Russia? Why is the signing of the 
agreement being opposed by a united front of seemingly 
diametrically opposed powers? I clearly see the situations in 
the case of either the agreement being signed or in the event 
that it is not signed. It is important not to permit 
manipulation of oneself or or others. Against that I place an 
understanding of our historical perspective and unpostponeable 
action. 
  With appropriate action we will confirm also that basic idea 
of the New World Order, that is that this order can 
be created on the road of negotiation, that large and small 
countries can can become equal partners on the road on 
negotiation. 
  The Basic Dimensions of Latvia's Foreign Policy 
  We must explain what critical global factors can influence 
our country in the mid-nineties of this century, as well as 
entering the Twenty-first century. The chief goal of our 
country's foreign policy is to guarantee our capacity to answer 
the future development of events, which could threaten our 
national interest. These threats, of a local or international 
character, also include developments in the demographic 
situation, social unrest, conflict over the status of 
minorities, and a one-sided decree's basic view of peacekeeping 
or strengthening security operations in other countries, 
political fragmentation, as well as economic decline. 
  We must clearly ascertain that real foreign policy cannot be 
based on many models at the same time, which is why security 
policy, at least at the level of conceptual thesis, should stand 
above squabbling by political parties. But unfortunately 
discussions of foreign policy and security policy issues are 
being exploited as tools for increasing capital in domestic 
politics. 
  What Are the Dimensions of Latvia's Foreign Policy? 
  1) We aspire to a new regionalism: In the broadest meaning 
this policy is crowned with Baltic cooperation within the 
context of European integration and has sketched in as a new 
element in European architecture, five plus three, which must be 
understood as beginning cooperation between the Scandanavian 
states and all three Baltic states within the context of a 
broadened European Union. The second element: A union of Baltic 
Sea states as a regional organization established in the 
Northeastern European Baltic region. 
  2) We want to place a growing emphasis on a mutually 
connected network of institutions in Europe. Still, we must 
think not only about what we want to receive from these 
institutions, but also what we will give them. 
  The European Union 
  In the recent past Latvia's inclination toward the European 
Community meant primarily that we distance ourselves from the 
former USSR, not approaching Europe. As Latvia's relations with 
the European Union developed, our security policy in Europe's 
dimension has acquired the greatest importance. Member state 
status in the European Union pays security dividends, which in a 
critical situation may turn out to be of decisive importance. 
Each step in the economic realm brings us closer to the European 
Union--a free trade agreement, which takes effect on 1 January 
1995 already, and after that its logical successor would be 
associate member state status, at the same time is an investment 
also in strengthening Latvia's security. 
  That is not a cost of "feelings of security." Economically, 
too, there is no alternative to such a direction for Latvia. Of 
course, right now Latvia could, without great effort, orient 
itself mainly toward the broad CIS market, although, in 
predicting Latvia's future development, I am convinced that that 
would ensure the backwardness of Latvia's industrial technology 
and we will encounter additional and unnecessary risks because 
of this disorderly and unpredictable market. That does not mean 
that we must decline everything which this promising market may 
offer, but still in my view it would be better to enter this 
economic space together with the European Union and not by 
competing with it. 
  The European Union is our road and hope for the future. The 
discussions to conclude the free trade agreement between the 
Baltic states and the European Union is an important part of 
this section of the road. As I have already stated, if the 
discussions conclude successfully, a free trade regime between 
the European Union and Latvia will go into effect on 1 January 
of next year, and will not apply to agricultural production. In 
addition, a four year transition period is anticipated during 
which both sides will agree on adapting the domestic market 
asymmetric protection principle to trade. In the future the 
European Union hopes to activate a political dialogue with the 
Baltic states and, as soon as the essential prerequisites are 
established, to begin discussions and to conclude agreements on 
offering associate member status. In fact the political dialogue 
has already begun and in the next few days its results will 
become apparent. But the result of incorrect actions by us may 
be that the political dialogue goes quiet. 
  By offering associate member status to the Baltic states the 
European Union is clearly defining the boundary of its political 
interests and that will certainly permit a more effective 
neutralization of Russia realizing her "near abroad" concept in 
Latvia. 
  The Western European Union 
  This is an organization, which is at once the European 
Union's military union and the NATO pillar in Europe. 
  Latvia's active participation in the Western European Union 
is a possibility, acquiring associate member state status in 
this organization. In the future the Western European Union 
anticipates having the decisive role in the European Union's 
joint defense policy, which is why it is possible that the 
highest possible participation status for Latvia will give us 
the opportunigy to have a hand in developing this policy from 
the very beginning. Besides active participation in the Western 
European Union will be one other road--Europe, through which 
Latvia will be able to align itself successfully with NATO. 
  NATO, the "Partnership for Peace," the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council 
  Latvia's policy with regard to NATO is oriented toward full 
member state status, the most serious security guarantee that 
Latvia could possibly receive. We cannot be only "security 
consumers." Changes in the international situation have 
influenced the NATO philosophy also. NATO established the 
"Partnership for Peace" program for cooperation in the military 
and security areas, with the help of which non-NATO countries 
could gradually develop individually, each country's wishes and 
possibilities appropriate to the dialogue with the NATO alliance. 
  "Partnership for Peace" today is another one of the threads 
which must be woven into Latvia's security blanket. The 
government must find an appropriate path which will, in this 
difficult economic time, balance the division of resources in 
Latvia's resolving many of the country's problems. We must 
determine how much the country of Latvia is ready to pay for 
today's and tomorrow's security. We must understand that wecan 
discuss it only so long as this country stands. 
  The European Conference on Security and Cooperation 
  The ECSC is the basic element of the European security 
architecture. 
  Our professional diplomats are actively working within the 
confines the the ECSC, to include this organization in resolving 
Latvian-Russian relations. When the agreements are concluded, 
ECSC representatives will also be able to participate in the 
joint commissions to verify implementation of the 
Agreement on the Skrunda early warning system radar temporary 
functioning and dismantlement, as well as the 
Agreement on social compensation for discharged military 
personnel. After the Skrunda agreement is signed ECSC 
representatives also will participate in inspecting this 
installation. 
  In speaking about the European Stability Pact or its 
so-called Baladur plan, we see that it has transformed from an 
idea to a constituent part of the European Union's joint foreign 
policy. Latvia has undertaken to join this pact in its essential 
problem resolution. This process, as is well known, will be 
inaugurated in the second half of May in Paris, at nineth pact 
inauguration conference. It is anticipated that twelve European 
Union countries and nine countries to which this initiative 
directly relates (the Baltic states, as well as Eastern and 
Central European states) and will participate. 
  In Latvia's view, without border consolidation and 
resolution 
of minority problems, round table discussions must be given 
broader scope, also touching on the most important security and 
stability in economic and social aspects. Since discussions will 
take place and resolutions will be adopted in accordance with 
the basic principles of the UN, ESCS and EU, that is, not 
altering borders with force and viewing them as inviolate, but 
that can be discussed, then, so that further discussion about 
these and other problems, essential discussions about exit 
points, about the occupation of the Republic of Latvia, and 
legal and political aspects of the ensuing annexation. 
  In our view cooperation in the security realm must be 
realized through bilateral agreements. 
  Latvia's security blanket is made stronger by mutual 
relations threads which, supported by mutual interests, tie us 
to different states. 
  The road to Europe works as a catalyst for Baltic 
cooperation. The Baltic states in their leaning toward Europe 
ever more clearly comprehend and more successfully realize this 
cooperation. Mutual consultations on security matters occur 
regularly, both at official levels (at the Prime Ministerial, 
Defense and Foreign Affairs Ministerial levels), and at the 
informal (regular foreign policy and defense planning 
conferences. Currently mutual coordination of Baltic states 
participation in the world security process is quite essential, 
for example, in the aforementioned project, the "Partnership for 
Peace," the Stability pact, as well as participation in defining 
our status in the Western European Union. 
  The successful cooperation of the Baltic states is an 
example 
to the world community and international organizations have 
commended the Baltic states' jointly established peacekeeping 
force batallion, which will be preparing to participate in the 
peacekeeping activities of the UN and other organizations. 
  We are united with Scandanavia in our mutual interests in 
the 
area of regional security and an understanding of the 
independence of the Baltic states. The Scandanavian countries 
are actively implementing the "Sovereignty Support Program," 
which helps to ensure domestic order and stability in the Baltic 
states. 
  After the visit to Latvia by Polish President Lech Walesa a 
new era has begun in relations between Latvia and Poland. 
Latvia, Poland and other "Visegrad states" have mutual goals 
both in relation to moving closer to European organizations and 
NATO. 
  We value highly the positive roles of Germany and France in 
the development of the European Union. Germany is Latvia's 
closest neighbor among the European Union's great powers. 
Germany has given and continues to give us essential assistance, 
supporting and accelerating our moving closer to Europe. 
  Domestic Aspects of Latvia's Security 
  The first task in developing our country's foreign policy 
and 
security policy is that we, as a nation, among ourselves, must 
agree on very significant matters. The most important is the 
necessary national unity (consensus) and political desire to 
maintain long-term faith in the chosen strategy in the area of 
our foreign policy and security policy. 
  In addressing this strategy, our national interests must 
first be clearly defined. 
  These are Latvia's national interests and goals: 
  1) maintaining the Republic of Latvia as a free and 
independent state which respects democratic values, is 
developing a free market economic system and guarantees 
protection of human rights; 
  2) developing the Republic of Latvia economically, which 
would ensure the opportunity for individual prosperity; 
  3) healthy and cooperative relations with neighboring 
states. 
  Regardless of how the world order and architecture change, 
our country's interests and goals remain unchanged. 
  Political and ideological threats to national security are 
the most dangerous and critical of all threats. 
  Various anti-state oriented organizations and groupings 
continue to operate in Latvia, which do not support the idea of 
an independent state and whose goals are contrary to Latvia's 
interests. 
  We all remember the goals and actions of these organizations 
during the October 1993 Moscow putsch. 
  Former USSR and Russian Federation retired military 
personnel 
are viewed as one of the sources of the threats from within 
Latvia. As is known, the Northwestern Army Group headquarters 
now pays pensions to 22 thousand people. In addition, their 
spouses and children also live in Latvia. Altogether they are 
about 100 thousand people, or close to three percent of Latvia's 
population. We should not look for the image of the enemy among 
these people, for the military personnel problem must be 
resolved in a civilized way. 
  Many USSR and Russian armed forces pensioners are active in 
the Veterans Rights Protection Union. If these Russian armed 
forces pensioners truly wish to demonstrate their loyalty to 
Latvia, than these people must publicly acknowledge the fact of 
Latvia's occupation in 1940. 
  What is most critical for a person to feel secure? It is 
essential that he have health, shelter and a job, which ensures 
necessary income. Threats to this social value creates not only 
a certain feeling of insecurity, but also increases 
opportunities to manipulate people's emotions, sense of 
security, increases instability and strife. In addition, the 
state of domestic security also is also determined by crime, the 
economic and ecological situation, and social welfare. Let's 
just remember what Swedish Prime Minister Karl Bildt reminded 
Latvia of during his visit to Latvia: It is not possible to 
reach 100 percent security from the zero level in one instant.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Panfilov, Glasnost Defense Fund expert, </F>
under the heading "Chronicle": "Persecution of Journalists and 
the Press in the Former USSR: April 1994 -- 2 Killed, 3 Beaten, 
23 Persecuted by the State"] 
  [Text] A previous report covering January-March 1994 
was published by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in April. The information 
published here is based on reports from the periodical press, 
human rights organizations and journalists. 
<H5>  Azerbaijan </H5>
  18 April: Under the pretense of rounding up draft 
evaders, at approximately 2:00 pm military personnel and police 
burst into the editorial offices of the newspaper AZADLYG, 
detaining 15 (according to other reports 11) journalists, 
including some beyond draft age -- Ganimat Zakhidov, Khikmat 
Sabiogla, Rafig Mamedli, Khikmet Zeynalov, Gorkhmat Ibragimov, 
Kyanan Salimov, and others. The detainees were taken to 
Sabailskiy Military Commissariat and released three hours later. 
  19 April: Police officers detained AZADLYG deputy 
editor Bakhaddin Gazyyev. Relatives and colleagues have not yet 
been able to learn his whereabouts. It is presumed that he has 
been forced to take up active military service at the front. 
  22 April: Police officers burst into the AZADLYG 
editorial offices and without presenting any documents took 
Zokhrab Amirkhanly, head of the newspaper's Humanitarian 
Section, and correspondent and Information Center staffer 
Yadigar Mamedli by force to the Sabailskiy Military 
Commissariat. Another group of police stormed into the Musavat 
Party building and forcibly took eight individuals to the same 
military commissariat, among them Mekhman Dzhvadogly, head of 
the party's Information Center, Chingiz Firudinogly, a 
correspondent for the newspaper YENI MUSAVAT, and Rovshan 
Aliyev, a correspondent for that paper and for GOLOS UKRAINY. 
Several hours later all the journalists with the exception of 
Rovshan Aliyev were released. It is possible that he is 
currently in active military service. 
  23 April: Yashar Turkazar, a Musavat Party 
activist and a YENI MUSAVAT carrier, was detained near the 
Musavat Party headquarters. 
<H5>  Armenia </H5>
  15 April: Vardges Petrosyan, editor-in-chief of 
the newspaper YERKIR NAIRI, Armenian Supreme Soviet deputy, 
writer and chairman of the Armenian Culture Fund, was killed by 
several shots fired at point-blank range in the driveway outside 
his home. One of the most widely circulated stories is that this 
was the result of a blood feud. 
<H5>  Belarus </H5>
  29 April: Three Belorussian newspapers were forced 
to cease publication due to rising printing costs. Before that 
happened the editors of those papers published a joint appeal to 
parliament and the government entitled "The Belorussian Press Is 
at Death's Door." On the eve of Belarus presidential elections 
NARODNAYA GAZETA and ZVYAZDA were advised to change their 
editorial line. 
<H5>  Georgia </H5>
  April: Klara Abramiya, the writer of an article in 
the newspaper SHANS concerning the activities of Georgia's 
ambassador to Russia, began receiving death threats and demands 
that she publish a retraction. Bondo Kurdadze, the newspaper's 
editor, came under automatic weapon fire on the way to his home. 
  9 April: The editorial offices of the newspaper 
SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA were attacked by unidentified individuals. 
The paper's property was damaged by a grenade. It has been 
suggested that the grenade was actually intended for a column of 
demonstrators, supporters of Georgia's ex-President Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia, who were passing by the editorial offices at the 
time. 
  15 April: The Georgian Council of Ministers 
distributed a resolution in which Archil Gogeliya, Georgian 
Television chairman, was instructed to "institute strict 
censorship on coverage of matters pertaining to Abkhazia." 
However, no official directives establishing direct censorship 
were issued. 
  28 April: Akakiy Mikadze, staff correspondent for 
the weekly MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, was attacked during a recess in 
a Georgian Parliament session. The assailants were Georgian 
Parliament deputies Tengiz Sigua and Tengiz Kitovani, who 
threatened Mikadze over his "bad articles." Tengiz Kitovani 
struck Mikadze in the temple with his fist. 
<H5>  Kazakhstan </H5>
  April: On the night of 16 April Viktor Rachkov, an 
employee of the newspaper KARAGANDA and a deputy in the local 
maslikhat (council), was run over by an automobile in 
Karaganda. He died 18 hours later without regaining 
consciousness. Officially, the automobile accident was listed as 
an ordinary traffic incident. However, it is known that Viktor 
Rachkov had reported frequent phone threats to his colleagues. 
According to information from a group of Karaganda journalists 
who conducted their own investigation into Rachkov's death, "not 
all the injuries on the body of the deceased support the traffic 
accident story. Furthermore, the deceased's clothing showed no 
sign of a collision with an automobile," assertions which were 
specifically confirmed by emergency medical personnel. 
<H5>  Kyrgyzstan </H5>
  12 April: Publication of the Moscow weekly 
ARGUMENTY I FAKTY was terminated. The official explanation was 
declining circulation. The only publication from Russia 
currently being published in Kyrgyzstan is KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. 
<H5>  Latvia </H5>
  April: The Latvian Saeima (parliament) passed a 
law on radio and television campaigning during elections to 
local self-government bodies. Under that law campaigning on TV 
Channel One was to be conducted exclusively in Latvian, with 80 
percent Latvian campaign ads on all other channels. 
  13 April: Latvian general procurator Yanis 
Skrastins issued the newspaper ATMODA a warning because the 
newspaper had allegedly printed articles "inciting violence." If 
the newspaper does not take action in response to this warning, 
a court could order it shut down. The newspaper's editor has 
stated that the paper does not intend to change its position. 
  20 April: Listening devices were discovered in the 
editorial offices of the newspaper DIENAS BIZNES, following 
which the Latvian Security Service sent the Latvian general 
procurator a letter requesting that a criminal investigation of 
the matter be undertaken. 
<H5>  Lithuania </H5>
  April: The board of the Lithuanian Television and 
Radio Company requested that the Lithuanian Government allocate 
funding for broadcasts of Ostankino Television and Radio Mayak 
programming. If the response to this request is positive, the 
broadcasts will be carried beginning at 6:00 pm each day. 
<H5>  Moldova </H5>
  26 April: A law was enacted within the territory 
of the unrecognized Dniester Moldavian Republic [DMR] under the 
title "On Protection of the Honor and Dignity of the President 
of the DMR." According to this law individuals who publicly 
insult the president of the DMR may be given a large fine or 
sentenced to up to six years in prison. Media outlets that 
disseminate materials that offend the president's honor and 
dignity are subject to closure. The Tiraspol City Court is 
currently hearing a suit by DMR President Igor Smirnov against 
the military commandant of Tiraspol, Russian Army Col. Mikhail 
Bergman, and the independent Asket Television Studio for the sum 
of R100 million [rubles]. A similar suit against Bergman and the 
television studio has been filed by DMR Supreme Soviet chairman 
Grigoriy Marakutsa. 
<H5>  Russia </H5>
  April: Andrey Kolobayev, an employee of the Moscow 
magazine KRIK, was beaten by militia officers while on official 
business in Syktyvkar (Komi Republic) and detained in a holding 
cell for five days. One possible reason for this was an 
appearance by Kolobayev on local television in which he levelled 
criticism at the local administration. After intervention by 
deputies from the Komi parliament and the Komi Republic minister 
of internal affairs Kolobayev was released. 
  April: The Pressa Publishing House suspended 
publication of 10 Moscow newspapers on account of financial 
difficulties. The newspapers were SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, 
FEDERATSIYA, 24, KHOZYAIN, SROCHNO V NOMER! and others. 
  6 April: Igor Mishin, president of the independent 
television company 4 Kanal stated that an attack on the 
television company office on the night of 7 April was political 
pressure on the eve of local elections. The intruders stole R10 
million in cash and documents after breaking out bars over the 
windows. 
  8 April: During a recess in a State Duma session 
deputy Vladimir Zhirinovskiy attacked Aleksandr Pyatkovskiy, a 
correspondent for the magazine STOLITSA, who had been sitting 
next to Zhirinovskiy during a clash with deputies and had 
recorded Zhirnovskiy's statements on a dictaphone. Upon seeing 
that, Zhirinovskiy began threatening Pyatkovskiy and attempted 
to twist his arm and take the dictaphone away from him. 
Aleksandr Pyatkovskiy has filed suit in connection with this 
assault. 
  14 April: Moscow's Presnenskiy Court heard the 
case of independent journalist Yaroslav Mogutin, who was accused 
of "malicious hooliganism" under Article 206, Section 2 of the 
Russian Federation Criminal Code. The grounds for the case were 
an article by Mogutin which appeared in the weekly NOVYY VZGLYAD 
under the title "Dirty Ends" and which used "obscene 
expressions." Mogutin's attorney, Genrikh Padva, noted that this 
is the first criminal case against a journalist over the use of 
obscene language. Support for the journalist has been expressed 
by the International PEN Club and the UNESCO Artists' 
Federation, as well as by approximately 60 well-known Russian 
cultural figures. In response to a petition by the attorney, the 
judge turned the case over to the procuracy for review. 
  16 April: Besik Urigashvili, an IZVESTIYA 
correspondent, was assaulted by militia officers on Bolshaya 
Bronnaya St. at approximately 9:30 pm. The officers demanded to 
see the journalist's documents, and when Urigashvili asked for 
an explanation as to why they were checking his documents in 
particular, they hit him with a nightstick, cutting his scalp. 
They made offensive remarks to the journalist, calling him 
"black." The journalist was taken to the 108th Militia Precinct 
and was released upon presenting his press identification card. 
  21 April: The Russian Federation Presidential 
Judicial Chamber on Information Disputes adopted a ruling 
entitled "On the Publication of the Article 'People Live Here!' 
in EKSPRESS-GAZETA, No. 5, 1994." The Judicial Chamber had at 
the request of the State Duma reviewed a Kupriyanov article 
devoted to deputies' perquisites. In the Judicial Chamber's 
ruling the article was termed "inaccurate and not objective" and 
found to be "a flagrant violation of legal and ethical 
standards." In view of this the Judicial Chamber recommended 
that Kupriyanov be dismissed from his current position. 
According to commentators, the Judicial Chamber does not have 
the authority to make that decision. 
  22 April: Grigoriy Musaelyan, director of the 
Russian Press House, received notice of that organization's 
immediate eviction -- within three days -- from a building 
located at 19 Novyy Arbat St. The Russian Press House's previous 
move occurred a few months ago, when the building it then 
occupied was needed to house the Russian parliament. In this way 
approximately 40 Russian newspaper have been forced to deal with 
moving instead of doing their jobs. 
  26 April: Sports journalists arriving at the 
awards ceremony for Olympic champions at St. George's Hall in 
the Kremlin were refused admittance. 
  29 April: According to information provided to 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS by unnamed sources, a memorandum has been 
circulated within the President's administration forbidding 
staff members to have contacts with journalists. This applies in 
particular to those who are oversee powerful structures or have 
access to classified documents. 
<H5>  Tajikistan </H5>
  18 April: Employees of the republic's newspaper 
and magazine industry went on strike to protest nonpayment of 
their salaries for three months. Also, printers are experiencing 
shortages of paper and offset printing plates, causing large 
gaps in newspaper and magazine publication schedules. 
<H5>  Turkmenistan </H5>
  10 April: Turkmenistan's president signed an edict 
removing Dzhumadurdy Nepesov, editor-in-chief of the magazine 
YASHLYK, from his position. Appointed to replace him was 
Durdymukhamet Kurbanov, who is secretary of the presidential 
press service and has written two books about Saparmurad 
Niyazov. YASHLYK journalists expect that when the new editor 
arrives the entire editorial staff will be fired. 
<H5>  Ukraine </H5>
  April: On the night of 9-10 April an explosion 
occurred at the editorial offices of MESHCHANSKAYA GAZETA 
(Simferopol, Republic of Crimea). The blast destroyed windows 
and doors in the building. In the opinion of MESHCHANSKAYA 
GAZETA's editor this act was directed at the newspaper, which is 
the most popular in the Crimea and constantly prints articles 
about corruption in the highest echelons of power. 
<H5>  Estonia </H5>
  April: Members attending a meeting of the Central 
and Eastern European Newspaper Publishers' Association sent a 
letter to Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar, calling on him to 
refrain from ideological pressure on the media. 
  1 April: Broadcasting of programs from Russia's 
Ostankino Television was terminated in Estonia due to nonpayment 
of debts. The motives behind this were that, firstly, Ostankino 
was supplying hostile information and, secondly, there was no 
other means of forcing the Russian-speaking population to take 
an interest in Estonian news programs. 
  4 April: Forty Estonian Parliament deputies 
proposed that that country's government replace the board of the 
state-owned Rahva Haael joint-stock company and cease its 
persecution of the newspaper EESTI SONUMID. On 28 March the 
company's board fired Toomas Leito, editor of the newspaper 
RAHVA HAAEL, who the following day announced his intention to 
begin publishing the newspaper EESTI SONUMID. The Estonian 
Parliament deputies stated that "this event makes it possible to 
include Estonia in the list of countries where freedom of the 
press is in danger." 
  * * * 
  The Glasnost Defense Fund is grateful to anyone who is 
interested in protecting freedom of speech and can provide 
information regarding persecution of journalists and the press.

<F P=106> [Interview with K. Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma </F>
Committee on CIS Affairs and Relations With Countrymen, by I. 
Rotar; place and date not given: "Become Our Satellites or 
Perish]" 
  [Text] 
<H5>  That is the view held by Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the </H5>
State Duma Comittee on CIS Affairs and Relations With Countrymen. 
<H5>  Revelations </H5>
  [Zatulin] I am an admirer of the empire if it is understood 
as imperial peace. I am not a proponent of ultranationalist 
empires and regard that concept as a means for the maintenance 
of peace. There is such a concept as sphere of influence, sphere 
of vital interest, regardless of whether you are a democrat or 
not. A small country must be happy that it is within the sphere 
of influence of a big power. A vivid example of that is the 
economic blossoming of postwar Japan when it was under the aegis 
of the U.S.A. The policy in the CIS is the domestic policy of 
Russia whether that offends anyone or not. We must win our 
special role in the near abroad. 
  [Rotar] Do you recognize the territorial integrity of 
countries of the near abroad? 
  [Zatulin] It is impossible to be pulling chestnuts out of 
the 
fire for others and recognize the territorial integrity of 
states which never existed within those borders. With all due 
respect for those states, many of them are destined to become 
our satellites or perish and I recognize their territorial 
integrity right up to that degree. 
  [Rotar] What meaning do you attach to the concept of a 
satellite? 
  [Zatulin] Countries of the near abroad must conclude special 
agreements establishing their special relations with Russia. 
That is neither relations within the framework of the USSR nor 
is it simply membership in the CIS the effectiveness of which is 
under question. Our special relations must deal primarily with 
the economy and the problem of national minorities living in 
those states. Russia must assume the protection of Russians 
living in the near abroad. If the national minorities live in 
compact groups, they must be granted autonomy--the state must 
become a federation. The special status of regions populated by 
national minorities must be backed up with guarantees from 
Moscow. 
  [Rotar] Could you indicate specifically which of the 
countries in the near abroad should have autonomies? 
  [Zatulin] Georgia--Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Moldova--the 
Dniester Region and Gagaus. Kazakhstan--northern part of the 
republic. Ukraine--eastern regions and Crimea. 
  [Rotar] How do you view the political situation in Georgia? 
  [Zatulin] The viewpoint that everyone, except the Georgians, 
is responsible for its troubles is still prevalent in Georgia. 
Recently, for instance, we had a meeting with a Georgian 
parliamentary delegation and one of its members consistently 
stressed that Russia must grant every concession since Georgia 
made a sacrifice by joining the CIS. This is some kind of a 
hypertrophied concept of reality. Let us begin with the fact 
that Russia helped the current leader of Georgia win in the most 
acute domestic confrontation with the, by the way, legal, 
president Eduard Gamsakhurdia. That gave Shevardnadze a great 
advantage (I am not even going to mention that Russia saved him 
from death in Abkhazia). Russia confirmed the territorial 
integrity of Georgia whereas in reality it does not exist, 
helped the republic economically, and in return received only 
the entry of that state into the CIS which thus far is a rather 
amorphous formation. 
  [Rotar] In your opinion what future awaits Ukraine? 
  [Zatulin] This is a complicated question. I believe that 
here 
there are fewer chances than in Moldova and Georgia that 
objective realities will be recognized. One political wing 
(mainly those who came from Western Ukraine) is adamantly 
dreaming of participation in all foreign political blocs hostile 
to Russia and visualizes the only possibility for existence of 
an independent Ukrainian state to be with the support of the 
enemies of Russia. But I am still hoping that the resolution of 
the problem will be the same as in Moldova and Georgia: alliance 
with Russia and a special status reinforced with guarantees by 
Moscow for eastern regions and Crimea. This is the only 
relatively peaceful outcome. The other variant means the 
disintegration of Ukraine. 
  [Rotar] Today Russian soldiers are dying in Tajikistan. One 
of the more widespread explanations of the reason for 
nonwithdrawal of the Russian army from that country consists is 
that Russia has no funds for the maintenance of a new border 
region. But even today Moscow is compelled to invest significant 
sums in that country. Tajikistan may turn into a bottomless pit 
for Russian money. 
  [Zatulin] Any expenditure is justified to preserve that 
outpost. 
  [Rotar] Do you have disagreements with the Russian MID 
[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]? 
  [Zatulin] After December, you understand what I am referring 
to, the Russian MID sharply changed its positions and our 
official positions are practically the same. It is true, I do 
lack confidence that declarations of the Russian MID will be 
implemented in practice.

<F P=106> [Letter to the editor from Zatulin: "I am not Bismarck, </F>
but..."] It is said that the average Frenchwoman can make three 
things out of any material on hand: a hat, an umbrella, and a 
tragedy. It was with interest that I acquainted myself with the 
attempt by Igor Rotar to present my views on the near abroad 
("Become Our Satellites or Perish" in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 5 May 
of this year). It seems to me that this is a contemporary 
variant of how with the aid of uncomplicated tricks, 
misrepresentation, double entente, and rearrangement of words 
coming from me, direct speech under the heading of "Revelations" 
is transformed by a foreign correspondent into a tragedy or an 
Ems dispatch. 
  At one time in editing an innocent text of a dispatch 
Bismarck precipitated the Franco-Prussian War. Naturally I 
cannot claim to be Bismarck or someone as important as he, but I 
categorically object against the situation where I. Rotar, 
acting as a guide and interpreter for his Japanese colleague at 
the meeting some month-and-a-half ago, now becomes wise at my 
expense, juggling the text which I have never seen. 
  Such an interest manifests itself particularly in the way in 
which the question regarding Tajikistan is posed and the manner 
in which the correspondent patiently coaches "my" reply, sharing 
wisdom and truth. But unfortunately he cannot get an intelligent 
answer from his slow-witted interlocutor as to which is better: 
have one's head torn off or go on vacation. 
  On the eve of Victory Day it is worth noting the fact that 
the word satellite in the newest Russian philology has a 
pejorative connotation which the word ally does not have at all 
and the author undoubtedly must know that. I leave "my 
revelations" of the type: "A small country must be happy that it 
is within the sphere of influence of a big power," as well as 
the abundance of military field terminology (such as "winning", 
"dying," etc.) on his conscience." I think that Russia, just as 
the USA and the entire world community, is not indifferent to 
the observance of the rights of an individual and not only a 
Russian one and not just in the YuAR [Republic of South Africa] 
but in the CIS as well. 
  The topics touched upon in this piece constitute material 
for 
a long article and not a brief comment. I will limit myself to 
the observation that CIS countries are not bowling pins and 
Russian journalists, in the intervals between representation of 
foreign professional interests, should not attempt to place all 
of those in the Duma in moulds of Vladimir Volfovich 
[Zhirinovskiy], even if they have been stored up for use in 
future articles. 
  Respectfully, 
Signed Konstantin Zatulin, 6 May 1994 
  [From NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Editor] We are publishing the 
letter from Mr. Zatulin, but because of the conflicting 
situation that developed the editorial office will now be forced 
to carefully compare the text of the taped interview with what 
was published in the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA and then return to this 
topic. The editorial office, however, is certain that Mr. Rotar 
does not speak either Japanese or English and therefore could 
not have been "an interpreter for a Japanese colleague" as 
asserted by Mr. Zatulin. Nevertheless the editorial office is 
also entertaining those premises of Mr. Zatulin which are 
illegitimate.

<F P=106> [Article by Nina Zhukova and Georgiy Ostapkovich: "Business </F>
Activity of Commercial Banks in Russia"] 
  [Text] The Center for Economic Conditions of the Russian 
Federation Government has conducted its regular survey of the 
business activity of Russian commercial banks for the second 
half of 1993 and their intentions for the first half of 1994. 
Some 82 commercial banks of Russia participated in the survey. 
These include 22 small banks (with authorized fund of up to R200 
million), or 27 percent of the total number of banks surveyed; 
20 mid-size banks (with authorized fund from R201 to R500 
million), or 24 percent; 14 large (with authorized fund from 
R501 million to R1 billion), or 17 percent; and 26 major banks 
(with authorized fund over R1 billion), or 32 percent of the 
total number of banks surveyed. 
  It must be noted that the time frame for conduct of the 
survey coincided with publication of the decision of the Russian 
Federation Central Bank to increase, effective 1 March of this 
year, the minimum authorized capital for newly registered 
commercial banks from R100 million to R2 billion, and bring the 
authorized fund of banks to 5 million ECU prior to 1999. The new 
rules reflect an objective orientation on the part of the 
Central Bank to effect the establishment in Russia of fairly 
large and stable commercial institutions with a developed branch 
network. In spite of the fact that presently existing small 
banks are capable of operating relatively comfortably for 
another five years, the results of this survey show a definite 
pessimism on the part of the directors of small banks with 
respect to their future prospects. The assessment of changes in 
the many indices characterizing the activity of these banks up 
through the end of the current half-year period is worse than 
the actual situation that has taken shape for the second half of 
1993. 
<H5>  Overall Results </H5>
  Bank directors predict development of the situation in 
Russia's monetary and credit market in the first half of 1994 as 
follows: 
  --two-thirds do not expect a worsening of the financial and 
economic situation in the banking system as a whole, including 
35 percent who are hoping for an improvement; 
  --60 percent report a possible strengthening of the 
financial 
and economic situation of their banks; 
  --eight out of 10 respondents expect increased profits; 
  --almost 90 percent predict an increase in their bank 
reserves; 
  --about 75 percent of the bank directors do not intend to 
reduce the share of total volume of attracted capital that 
consists of interbank credits, and 44 percent expect this to 
increase; 
  --virtually no bank intends to reduce its staff, and 65 
percent are planning on augmenting this; 
  --only one bank out of 10 expects an improvement in the 
financial and economic situation of its state enterprise clients; 
  --only 20 percent of the banks propose to expand their 
deposit base by virtue of state enterprises; 
  --68 percent of bank directors do not expect a deterioration 
in the financial and economic situation of commercial structures 
being provided services, and more than a third predict 
improvement here; 
  --virtually no one is planning on reducing the affording of 
credits to commercial structures, and 82 percent of respondents 
expect this will be increased; 
  --more than half state the possibility of expanded 
investments by commercial structures; 
  --88 percent predict a growth in their number of clients 
among the populace; 
  --90 percent of the directors intend to expand the deposit 
base of their banks through deposits by physical persons; 
  --eight out of 10 intend to engage in short-term loan 
transactions, and only 16 percent--in long-term credits. 
<H5>  The Financial and Economic Situation of Banks and the </H5>
Banking System in General 
  As in previous periods, the majority of respondents noted no 
deterioration of the financial and economic state of the banking 
system on the whole in the second half of 1993. Some 70 percent 
stated there was in fact an improvement, and only 10 percent--a 
deterioration in the situation at their banks. According to 
predictions, the favorable situation in their activity will be 
maintained in the first half of 1994 (60 percent and 9 percent, 
respectively). 
  Directors of the major banks turned out to be more 
optimistic 
than the others. More than 75 percent reported an improvement, 
and less than 8 percent--a deterioration of the financial and 
economic situation of their banks in the second half of 1993. 
The most unfavorable situation was seen with respect to the 
small banks--63 percent and 14 percent of respondents, 
respectively. If we compare actual and predicted assessments, 
the latter were more pessimistic in the eyes of directors of all 
bank categories. In this regard, the smaller the banks, the less 
frequently their directors provided positive forecasts with 
respect to the current year. Thus, 81 percent of respondents 
from the major banks, 64 percent of those from the large banks, 
and 55 percent of those representing mid-size banks expected an 
improvement in the financial and economic state of their 
institutions (virtually no one predicted a deterioration). For 
the small banks, this index dropped to 37 percent (27 percent of 
the respondents expect a deterioration of the situation). 
Analysis shows the same kind of direct dependence linking the 
size of the banks with their expected profit. 
  As far as the state of the banking system on the whole is 
concerned, the most pessimistic assessments of both the actual 
second half of 1993 and the predicted first half of 1994 were 
expressed by the directors of small banks. Respondents from the 
mid-size banks were the most optimistic here. 
<H5>  Bank Clients and Their Financial and Economic Situation </H5>
  The survey showed that the trend towards active enlistment 
by 
banks of physical persons and commercial structures as clients 
was maintained in the second half of 1993. In both instances 
about 90 percent of all those surveyed indicated an expansion, 
and practically no one--a reduction in the numbers of clients in 
these categories. Respondents make a similar prediction with 
respect to the beginning of 1994. 
  The overall reduction in bank clients comprising state 
enterprises continues. Respondents reported increases in the 
number of such enterprises as clients of their banks only half 
as often as they reported decreases (17 as opposed to 34 
percent). Approximately the same distribution of assessments is 
expected for the first half of 1994. 
  On the whole, respondents assessed positively the change in 
financial and economic state of their clients comprising 
physical persons. Over half believed this situation improved; 
only one out of 10--that it worsened. According to predictions, 
the corresponding figures for the first half of 1994 are 48 and 
15 percent. The opinion of the bankers regarding the past and 
present state of commercial structures is entirely ambiguous--in 
both instances, each possible response (improved, worsened, did 
not change) was indicated by about a third of the respondents. 
For comparison purposes, we note that in the beginning of 1993 
more than half the respondents believed the financial and 
economic situation of businessmen had become more favorable. The 
bank directors provided an appreciably worse assessment of the 
situation of state enterprises than they did during the previous 
period--60 percent note a deterioration and just 7 percent--an 
improvement in the second half of 1993. For the first half of 
1994, 51 and 10 percent, respectively, of respondents predict 
such change. 
<H5>  Attracted Capital </H5>
  As in the beginning of 1993, two-thirds of bankers reported 
an increase, and less than 10 percent--a decrease, in the 
deposits of commercial structures in the second half of 1993. In 
this regard, only just over half predict that such deposits will 
increase during the current period (4 percent predict a 
decrease). 
  Directors of the mid-size banks reported an increase in the 
deposits of commercial structures significantly more frequently 
than the others--nine out of 10 so responded. Mid-size banks 
intend to a greater degree than the other categories to attract 
deposits of the nonstate sector of the economy in the first half 
of 1994. 
  In the second half of 1993, banks appreciably intensified 
their activity, as compared with previous periods, with respect 
to expansion of their resource base by attracting capital of the 
populace. More than 90 percent of respondents noted an increase, 
and virtually no one--a reduction. A similarly high degree of 
activity by banks among the populace in general is predicted for 
the current half year as well. 
  This trend, noted over the course of all surveys, shows that 
the absolute monopoly of Sberbank [Savings Bank] over deposits 
by the populace is gradually weakening. This is explained by the 
more flexible interest rate policy and broader range of services 
offered by commercial banks as compared with Sberbank. 
  Judging from the survey results, a reduction was seen in the 
second half of 1993 in the share of banks increasing their 
attracted capital by virtue of the deposits of state 
enterprises. Some 37 percent of respondents indicated a 
reduction, and only one-fourth--an increase in such 
contributions. The large banks clearly led in this respect (65 
and 21 percent of respondents, respectively). A further 
reduction of the deposits of state enterprises is expected in 
the first half of 1994. Here only the mid-size banks are 
"falling out" of this trend. In evaluating the past and current 
periods, more than a third of their directors note an increase, 
and only 20 percent--a reduction, in the contributions of these 
enterprises. 
  A high dependence by surveyed banks on the market of 
interbank credits was observed over the course of all surveys. 
Approximately two-thirds of respondents regularly reported the 
expansion, and only about 15 percent--the reduction, of such 
credits. Mid-size bank respondents reported more frequently than 
other categories about increases and less frequently about 
decreases in the securing of interbank loans during the last 
half of 1993. For the current half year, however, it will 
apparently be the large and major banks that will be most active 
in the interbank credits market. 
  The interest rates of commercial banks on deposits continued 
to rise during the second half of 1993. Nine out of 10 directors 
reported an increase (and one out of 10--no change). Predicting 
the situation for the first half of 1994, 80 percent of 
respondents indicated such an increase. The interest rates of 
small banks increased to a lesser degree than those of other 
bank categories. The rise in interest rates of the large and 
major banks will decelerate over the current half year, 
according to the survey. 
<H5>  Credit Policy </H5>
  No significant changes took place in the second half of 1993 
in the credit portfolio of commercial banks, and no changes are 
expected in the first half of 1994. As before, commercial 
structures remain the main borrowers from banks. About 87 
percent of respondents reported an increase in loans afforded 
these structures over the past half-year period, and 82 percent 
expect an increase during the current period (in both instances 
virtually no one indicated a decrease). 
  According to the survey data, major banks displayed the 
greatest activity in affording credits to commercial structures. 
None of these reduced, and 92 percent increased their extension 
of credits to these clients during the second half of 1993. 
During the first half of 1994, all the major banks are planning 
on increasing their credits. Major banks have also expanded and 
will continue to expand the amounts of hard currency afforded 
commercial structures to a greater degree than other categories 
of banks. 
  Despite the worsening of the financial situation of state 
enterprises noted by respondents, banks have continued to 
increase the credits afforded these structures, though in 
smaller amounts. In the second half of 1993, less than half (44 
percent) the respondents reported increases here, and almost 30 
percent--decreases in loans allocated to the state sector. 
  It is expected that during the first half of 1994, the 
number 
of respondents indicating increases will again go down (to 37 
percent), and the number indicating decreases will remain at its 
prior level. In this regard, about 60 percent of banks did not 
lend hard currency to state enterprises. About 15 percent 
expanded, and 7 percent reduced their extension of hard currency 
credits during the second half of 1993. It is expected that the 
gap between these two indices will narrow during this half-year 
period, also that the major banks will be the most active bank 
category with respect to extending credits to state enterprises 
in the first half of 1994. This includes hard currency 
transactions as well. 
  Commercial banks significantly augmented the scale on which 
they provide services to the populace during the second half of 
1993, as compared with the previous period. Some 45 percent of 
respondents reported an increase here, and only 9 percent--a 
decrease in loans extended to physical persons. For the current 
half-year period, these figures are 40 and 11 percent, 
respectively. Mid-size banks, as well as the major banks, 
expanded their provision of credits to the populace to a greater 
extent than other bank categories. According to predictions, 
mid-size banks will maintain a high degree of activity during 
the current half year. The large banks will join them. 
  Over the course of all the surveys, a stable 12 percent of 
respondents reported diminished extension of credits to other 
banks. The proportion of respondents noting an increase rose 
steadily, however. This percentage reached 27 percent during the 
past half year, and is expected to reach 32 percent during the 
current period. 
  Not a single bank reduced its rates on credits extended 
during the second half of 1993, and 93 percent increased these 
rates. Judging from the responses of bank directors, a certain 
stabilization around the level of the second half of 1993 is 
expected for the current half year with respect to the cost of 
obtaining credit. Over 20 percent of the respondents so 
indicated. Apparently, the real reduction in the rate of 
inflation seen in recent months enables us even now to evaluate 
the current rates as favorable. 
  The directors of small banks responded more frequently than 
those of other bank categories regarding the possibility of 
maintaining interest rates at their previous level. In addition 
to the above-mentioned factor, the fact that many small banks 
are greatly dependent upon their founders also exerts an 
influence on such expectations. Under the present circumstances 
they are often compelled to extend credits to their founders at 
lowered interest rates. 
<H5>  Priorities and Main Orientations of Credit Policy </H5>
  During the second half of 1993, as before, short-term loans 
remained a priority in the structure of credits, almost 90 
percent of the respondents reporting increases in this regard, 
and just 1 percent--reductions. The figures with respect to 
long-term credits were 16 and 34 percent, respectively, i.e., 
the scale of provision of investment credits diminished even 
more. In this regard, judging from the distribution of 
respondent replies, about 30 percent of the banks did not extend 
long-term credits at all. The intensity of expansion of 
short-term credits will apparently decrease somewhat during the 
current half year, while the reduction in extension of long-term 
credits will continue at approximately the same level. In this 
regard, whereas fewer than one-fourth of the banks maintained 
the level of such credits unchanged during the second half of 
1993, this number is expected to be over 30 percent in the first 
half year of 1994, according to predictions. 
  At the same time, the survey results show that a rather 
significant group of commercial banks operating in Russia's 
monetary and credit market do not foresee a reduction in 
long-term credits in the first half of 1994. These comprise 
primarily the small (46 percent) and large (50 percent) banks. 
Whereas most of the small, "pocket" banks will be engaged in 
this activity by virtue of pressure founders exert on them, the 
large banks can be viewed as potential credit institutions 
prepared to engage in the financing of investment projects. 
  Clearly, the swiftest possible implementation of the main 
provisions affixed in the March decree of the Russian Government 
on financing and affording credits for capital construction in 
the Russian Federation could greatly minimize the risk to banks 
related to provision of long-term credits and could make this 
type of banking activity more attractive. 
  The survey shows that banking structures intend to increase 
their financial support to all sectors of the Russian Federation 
economy during the first half of 1994. The scale on which this 
support will be provided varies greatly, however. In the opinion 
of the bankers, trade is the preferred sphere of future credit 
investments. Two-thirds of all respondents predict an increase, 
and only one out of every 10--a decrease in such investments. 
About half of the respondents expect growth in credits extended 
to industry and only 15 percent--a reduction. The situation with 
respect to financial support for construction is noticeably 
worse. One-third of the bankers intend to increase their 
issuance of loans to this sector of the economy during the 
current half year, while 17 percent intend to reduce it. 
Investments in the infrastructure will increase to a lesser 
extent than investments in other spheres. 
  Large banks will expand their issuance of loans to the 
sphere 
of trade on a significantly larger scale than other bank 
categories, as stated by 86 percent of the large bank directors 
(none indicated any reduction in these loans). Credits afforded 
this sector of the economy by mid-size banks will increase more 
intensively than the sampling average. 
  Large banks intend to increase their financial support to 
industry to a greater degree than the others. About 65 percent 
of their directors reported a growth in extension of industrial 
credits, and just 7 percent--a decrease. Small banks are 
expected to show a low degree of activity. However, small banks 
lead the way in affording loans to agriculture. Their directors 
predicted growth of these loans more often (one out of two), and 
diminution less (14 percent). The major banks also intend to 
increase credits to agriculture, while mid-size and large banks 
intend to reduce them. 
  As far as the construction sphere is concerned, the 
following 
rule applies. The larger the bank, the greater the scale on 
which investments in it will increase. 
  Mid-size banks intend to support the infrastructure most 
actively. Their directors reported possible increases 
significantly more frequently than others (40 percent), and 
reductions--less frequently (5 percent) in the issuance of loans 
to this sphere. 
  It should be noted in conclusion that, on the whole, the 
predicted and actual assessments of bank credit policy in the 
second half of 1993 coincided. In this regard, bankers were 
somewhat more optimistic in predicting expansion of their 
clientele than in afterwards asserting the reality, while they 
were more pessimistic in assessing the future scale of expansion 
of attracted capital.

<F P=106> [Article by economist Andrey Illarionov from "Ekspertiza" </F>
section: "Budget As Mirror of Government's Real Intentions"] 
  [Text] The budget submitted by the Russian Government to 
the State Duma concentrates its main passions, political 
intentions, and targeted priorities: 
  -- a costly state; 
  -- the bureaucracy's financial revenge; 
  -- discrimination in education, science, culture, art, the 
legal system, and all civil society; 
  -- open allegiance to power structures; 
  -- a return to the practice of monstrously inefficient state 
expenditure; 
  -- payment of for the political support of agrarian and 
other 
lobbies; 
  -- deceiving its own country and the world community. 
  In any country the presentation of the state budget to 
parliament is a very important political event. No other 
documents -- programs, statements, and promises -- can reveal 
either the alleged or real intentions of the government as can 
the budget. 
  The draft federal budget for 1994 with its recent April 
corrections submitted by the Russian Government to the State 
Duma clearly shows what the features of the new stage of 
"continuation of the reforms" are and what the aims of the 
present government team are. This is all the more interesting 
because "in this document," as V. Chernomyrdin has frequently 
stressed, "we have tried for the first time in many years to 
tell the truth and only the truth." 
  What is the truth about the state budget? 
  Let us compare the three draft budgets for 1994. The first 
was prepared in February to a considerable extent under the 
influence of B. Fedorov, who at the time had only just left the 
government. The second was derived from the first as a result of 
numerous discussions and amendments in the direction of "greater 
feasibility" and "greater inflation security" and was submitted 
as an official draft to the Duma in March. Finally on 26 April 
-- immediately after the session of the IMF directorate which 
officially granted Russia the second part of the systemic credit 
-- the government sent the Duma the new draft budget with an 
increased deficit. The differences between these three drafts 
come down to a change in the relationships between the various 
items. 
  Sociocultural measures were subjected to the biggest change. 
Whereas in 1992, not the best year, 10.3 percent of all state 
expenditure was channeled into these purposes, in 1993 the 
figure was 7.8 percent and according to the March draft of the 
budget it was 6.8 percent and according to the April draft 6.4 
percent. 
  Expenditure on national education shows the same tendency -- 
5.8, 3.9, 3.9, and 3.4 percent respectively. 
  Financing for fundamental scientific research was in no 
better a position. The government leadership's repeated 
statements and promises to support science acquired concrete 
expression in a reduction in science's share in all state 
expenditure, from 2.6 percent in 1992 to 2.2 percent in the 1994 
draft. 
  The programs and spheres also subjected to reduction 
included 
the conversion of the defense industry, the conservation of the 
environment, the legal system, reserves, and the supplementing 
of state stocks, the implementation of international arms 
limitation treaties, and the extinguishing and servicing of the 
foreign debt. 
  Against the background of the mass reductions the budget 
items for which expenditure is growing both relatively and in 
absolute terms deserve special attention. Thus, for instance, 
according to the February version of the budget it was planned 
to spend 0.5 percent of all state expenditure on pure subsidies 
for agriculture, while in the March version the figure was 2.2 
percent and in the April version 2.6 percent. In all in 
February it was planned to spend 1.3 percent of all state 
expenditure on agriculture, in March the figure was 2.8 percent, 
and in April 7.4 percent. And this is obviously not a limit 
since agricultural workers are still dissatisfied and the 
government, in its 23 February decree, promised them nearly 12 
percent of all expenditure. 
  Expenditure on agriculture for various items is increased in 
varying degrees. Whereas expenditure on maintaining 
agricultural production is increasing by a factor of 25 as a 
whole, expenditure on the development of private farming is only 
increasing by a factor of 11 while expenditure on the 
acquisition of imported output for agriculture increased by a 
factor of 96! Now it is becoming clear who is getting the funds 
saved at the expense of our teachers, doctors, scientists, and 
cultural and art workers. 
  Graphic evidence of the government's resolute return to the 
"trench digging" practice of the pre-reform years was the 
increase in expenditure on one of the most ineffective and 
corrupt avenues for the use of state funds -- centralized 
investments. Their proportion in the GDP is to increase from 
1.7 percent in 1993 to 4.8 percent in 1994. 
  Expenditure is also increasing on defense (4.7 percent of 
the 
GDP in 1992, 4.4 percent in 1993, and 5.1 percent in 1994); on 
law enforcement activity and the security organs (1.3, 1.5, and 
1.7 percent of the GDP respectively); and on mobilization 
training (0.02 percent of the GDP in 1993 and 0.05 percent in 
1994). 
  Generally speaking even the present 20 percent of overall 
state expenditure which goes on defense is the level of the 
prewar years of 1913 and 1940 and also of the time of the most 
acute confrontation between the USSR and the United States 
during the Cold War. Are we planning to go to war again? 
  Another record-beater in terms of the pace at which 
expenditure has increased was the "state management" item, 
particularly that part relating to the central apparatus of 
ministries and departments. With an average growth rate of 470 
percent for all budget expenses, expenditure on the maintenance 
of this part of the state machine is increasing by a factor of 
17.3 and its share in the GDP is quadrupled -- from 0.05 percent 
to 2 percent. 
  Since Government apparatus leader V. Kasov asserts that the 
numerical strength of the number of those employed in the 
federal organs of power has remained constant for several years 
now -- about 35,000 people -- and premier V. Chernomyrdin even 
speaks of reducing the size of the organs of state management 
and the numerical strength of the apparatus workers, this 
increase in expenditure means that each one remaining will have 
a considerably more substantial share of the national pie. As a 
result average expenditure "per federal apparatus capita" will 
increase from 200,000 rubles [R] a month in 1993, which was 3.4 
times more than the average wage for the national economy 
(R59,000) to about R3.5 million a month, which is over 12 times 
the average Russian monthly salary in 1994 (R280,000 according 
to the Ministry of the Economy forecast). So that the Russian 
bureaucrat will seemingly not disappear.. 
  In addition it is planned to increase the proportion of 
funds 
channeled to help other levels of power from 2 percent to 3.4 
percent of the GDP. The central government thus receives an 
additional financial lever for exerting influence, including 
political influence, on the situation in the regions. 
  Since the main aim of the March and April amendments to the 
budget, as the premier stated, was to reduce its inflationary 
potential, we should look at what kind of a change there has 
been to that part of its deficit which is covered by Central 
Bank credits and thus generates inflation. The February draft 
provided for a loan of R35 trillion (4.8 percent of the GDP) for 
the purpose, the March draft proposed R38 trillion (5.2 percent 
of the GDP), and the April budget R44.4 trillion (6.1 percent). 
Consequently the inflation threat is not decreasing but 
increasing. At the same time this is the best illustration of 
the way the government leadership's loyalty to the word it gave 
at the talks with the IMF that in any case Central Bank credits 
would not exceed 5 percent of the GDP. 
  Moreover, the Russian tradition of executing the budget is 
known for the fact that the amendments regularly made to it 
reduce its revenue and increase expenditure and consequently the 
deficit. That this tradition is not forgotten is borne out by 
recent government decisions. The story of the scandalous 
reduction of excise for vodka and spirits had not been 
forgotten, less than two weeks had elapsed since the budget was 
submitted to parliament, yet the government had already decreed 
that the Izhevsk production association of machine building 
enterprises be exempted from excise on motor vehicles and that 
expenditure on the coal sector be increased. A few more weeks 
elapsed and there was a new increase in expenditure. This time 
90 percent of their increase is intended for the agrarian lobby. 
Obviously this is not the final amendment. 
  Now we can understand the government's real intentions. The 
approval of the budget by the State Duma as a law will mean the 
deputies' public solidarity with that system of views.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the </F>
government: "We Have Entered the Most Difficult Phase of the 
Transformations"] 
  [Text] The establishment of market relations is continuing 
in Russia's economy and measures are being taken to reduce the 
social costs of the transition period. Measures have been taken 
to curb inflation. The process of privatization is going 
relatively dynamically. The nonstate sector of the economy is 
gathering speed. The rates of decline of investment activity 
have slowed up. The consumer market is being restored. The 
country's foreign trade balance has been reduced to a positive 
total. 
  Nonetheless, in spite of certain successes, the situation in 
the economy remains unstable. Last year crisis processes were 
not halted. The gross domestic product decreased by 13 percent, 
industrial production--by more than 16 percent, agricultural 
production--by 4 percent, capital investments--by 16 percent, 
and foreign trade turnover--by 13 percent. Prices of goods and 
services increased more than ninefold. 
  The socioeconomic situation that developed during the first 
quarter of this year is characterized by a continuing decline of 
the volumes of industrial production and a lowering of the level 
of capital investments with a simultaneous increase in prices of 
industrial products and consumer goods. Measures taken by the 
government are still not producing the desired results. The 
greatest decline in the first quarter of this year occurred in 
the machine-building, chemical, metallurgical, and wood 
processing industries. The production of consumer goods and 
foodstuffs continues to decrease. For certain goods in light 
industry--from 15 to 54 percent. In February alone as a result 
of the closing down of 4,500 enterprises, 22 million man-days of 
work time were lost. Production has come to a complete halt at 
428 enterprises, including such large ones as the "Kirovskiy 
Zavod," LOMO, the Baltic plant, "Rostselmash," and many others. 
  This is occurring because of the lack of funds and because 
of 
difficulties with product sales. This accounts for up to 60 
percent of the losses. Practically all branches and sectors of 
the national economy have come up against this strict limitation 
of demand. There is no possibility and sometimes even no hope of 
selling products that are produced. Inflation is exacerbating 
the economic crisis. 
  As usual, nonpayments are still problem number one. While 
during the first half of last year monetary funds available to 
the enterprises exceeded the defaulted indebtedness to the 
suppliers, during the second half they amounted to only half the 
sum of indebtedness. During the first months of this year we 
came right up to the indicators of the summer of 1992. Now, 
however, commodity producers are tightening the strings: If 
there is no money, there will be no deliveries. As a result, 
indebtedness on wages has become worse. Today it amounts to more 
than 2 trillion rubles [R]. 
  The problem of nonpayments has been tormenting the Russian 
economy for two years now. There is the widespread opinion that 
nonpayments arise as a result of the government's severe 
financial-credit policy. Perhaps this might have been fair 
regarding 1992, but now the situation is completely different. 
In my view nonpayments today are brought about primarily by 
debts of the budget and the CIS countries to the Russian 
commodity producers, particularly the fuel and energy complex. 
In the second place is the lack of control of monetary flows and 
the concealed redistribution of funds among various enterprises 
and entire sectors of the economy. Frequently money that is 
supposed to be used for settlements with suppliers and for 
augmenting circulating capital is used to increase wages, to 
cover notes, and so forth. Nonpayments are increasing because of 
the lack of demandingness on the part of those who extend credit 
to the debtors. For some reason they all apply to the government 
for money but they are in no hurry to file charges for 
reimbursement of losses from the debtors. A third reason I would 
call the inability on the part of many enterprise managers to 
engage in increasing production effectiveness, reducing outlays, 
updating output, and expanding the sales network. We would like 
the enterprises, banks, and financial institutions themselves to 
find a way out of the situation that has developed. Many 
interesting plans are being suggested. For example, 
"Tveruniversalbank" has developed and is implementing a system 
for straightening out nonpayments with the emission of their own 
notes. So it is not mandatory to wait for financial support from 
the government, they can act on their own. The state, of course, 
settles debts, but its debts make up no more than 20 percent. 
The remaining 80 percent are debts of enterprises to one 
another. The government cannot take responsibility for them. 
  The Russian economy has entered the most difficult phase of 
its structural transformations. It is necessary to exert every 
effort so that these transformations bring the country not the 
usual problems but signs of improvement. 
  The government has begun to revise the list of projects to 
be 
supported by the budget. Existing legislation on bankruptcy is 
beginning to be enforced taking into account the priorities of 
the structural policy and its concrete objectives this year. It 
is proposed to shut down a number of branches that are operating 
at a loss or are ineffective and to adopt measures for social 
adaptation of discharged workers. Next in line is the adoption 
of measures necessary for creating conditions for development of 
the activity of Russian commodity producers in markets of the 
CIS countries. It is necessary to find ways of restoring 
investment activity and providing for an influx of capital into 
industry from other sectors of the economy by attracting free 
financial funds of the banks and the population. 
  In the near future the government intends to take a number 
of 
additional measures to stabilize the situation in the Russian 
economy. It has been decided to render state support to 
enterprises of the coal industry. During the first half year 
alone, in keeping with the developed schedules, R3.4 trillion is 
to be paid from the budget to them. A decree has been adopted 
concerning repayment during the first quarter of mutual 
indebtedness for a number of members of the defense industry and 
the agro-industrial and fuel-energy complexes. In order to 
increase the effectiveness of utilization of investments, a 
provision has been established concerning financing and granting 
credit for capital construction. Proposals have been prepared 
for stabilizing the work of enterprises of the fuel and energy 
complex. The government has taken a stand in questions of quotas 
for shipping strategic raw material resources, import customs 
duties, and a list of federal target programs financed this year 
from the budget. Next in line are proposals concerning state 
regulation and control of railroad rates and also rates for 
electric and thermal energy. In order to provide for payment of 
wages in the fuel and energy complex and the timber and wood 
processing industry it is permitted to leave up to 50 percent of 
the funds from product sales in the accounts of the enterprises. 
I would say that not all of the aforementioned measures can be 
called 100 percent market measures, but the government has been 
forced to resort to them.

<F P=106> [Address from the Ministry of Finance of the Russian </F>
Federation to the Citizens of the Russian Federation: "Beware of 
Tricksters"] 
  [Text] At the present time in the securities market a 
critical situation has developed wherein unscrupulous 
entrepreneurs, taking advantage of the fact that the population 
does not have enough experience in questions of acquiring 
securities and that the legislation is imperfect for their own 
selfish purposes, are unfairly getting rich at the expense of 
others and undermining the population's confidence in 
conscientious participants in the securities market. In order to 
protect the interests of the investors and provide for normal 
functioning of the securities market, the Ministry of Finance of 
the Russian Federation suggests that all citizens involved 
follow the following recommendations when buying and selling 
securities. 
  1. First of all, gather as much information as possible 
about 
who is issuing the securities you have decided to acquire (that 
is, the issuer). 
  If the issuer is a bank or a credit institution, find out 
how 
many years it has been functioning, what its authorized capital 
is, and the kinds of banking operations for which it is licensed. 
  2. Make sure that the securities have been through state 
registration and attentively study the prospectus for the 
issuance of securities registered by the financial organs. 
  3. Never trust advertising statements. A decision to invest 
money in securities may be made only on the basis of a 
comprehensive analysis of the prospectus for the issuance of 
securities, bookkeeping reports, the nature of the activity of 
the issuer, and the overall conditions of the market in which 
the given issuer is operating. 
  4. When completing transactions with securities use only the 
services of professional participants in the securities market 
(investment institutions with the appropriate licenses). 
  5. Make certain that the seller is the owner of the 
securities or an employee of the owner of the securities. If the 
seller of the security is acting on instructions from the owner 
of the securities (on the basis of a commission agreement or 
instructions agreement) he must be a worker of the investment 
institution and have a qualifications certificate of the first 
category (that is, it is necessary to demand a Xerox copy of the 
license for the right to conduct activity as an investment 
institution and a Xerox copy of the qualification certificate of 
the first category). 
  6. It is recommended that the transaction for purchase and 
sales of securities be documented in the form of a written 
contract which must specify: the procedure for settlements in 
the transaction, the procedure for entering the new owner in the 
stockholder's register, the procedure for paying the tax on the 
operation involving securities, etc. 
  7. Register the transaction in an investment institution, a 
bank, or with the issuer whose securities you are buying. 
  8. As practice shows, at the present time the most risky 
things are to invest money in bills of exchange and to grant 
loans through concluding loan contracts. Issuing bills of 
exchange and concluding loan contracts do not require either 
state registration or the acquisition of any kind of special 
permission (license), and this is why these financial 
instruments are used most frequently by unscrupulous 
entrepreneurs in order to deceive the population. Here neither 
the issuer of the note nor the borrower under the loan contract, 
as a rule, reveals any information about his financial position 
or the nature of his activity. Remember that when concluding a 
loan agreement you are entering into civil-legal relations with 
the borrower and in the event of a conflict you may defend your 
interests only through the courts. The specific nature of the 
bill of exchange is such that the absence of even one of the 
mandatory requisites makes it invalid. 
  If you decide to purchase bills of exchange you should know 
that the most reliable ones are bills from large banks and 
banking syndicates. 
  9. Remember that investing funds in nonstate securities 
practically always involves a risk. The fact that the securities 
you buy have been registered by the state is no guarantee of a 
return on the money you have invested or of the reliability or 
profitability of these securities. The main axiom for investment 
activity in the securities market is that the greater the 
profitability of the securities, the greater the risk. 
  10. Do not give in to the general tendencies to invest your 
money for interest that exceeds the average market interest many 
times over. 
  Remember that the founders of a joint-stock company are 
responsible to the other stockholders only within the limits of 
their personal contribution to the authorized capital. 
Investments in joint-stock companies with small amounts of 
authorized capital that have declared issuances thousands of 
times greater than their authorized capital are extremely risky.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Burkov, chairman of the Duma </F>
Committee on Property, Privatization, and Economic Activity, by 
Vladimir Chernyshev; place and date not given: "Parliamentary 
Hearings. An Intelligent Law Is Not Born in a Hurry"] 
  [Text] The parliamentary hearings on the course of 
privatization conducted recently in the state Duma confirmed: 
The State Committee on the Administration of State Property of 
the Russian Federation will continue its work "outside laws." 
And the esteemed department does not wish to burden itself with 
developing drafts of them. The victorious reports about 
privatization encompassing all of Russia, the triumphant news 
conferences and the corresponding publications are intended to 
give the appearance of well-being. And this is against a 
background of an almost total lack of the legislative base 
necessary for destatization. 
  But when will there be viable Russian laws protecting 
property owners from the omnipotence and arbitrariness of the 
bureaucracy. And finally, how did the hearings that were 
conducted go? With these questions I "attacked" the chairman of 
the Duma Committee on Property, Privatization, and Economic 
Activity, Sergey Burkov. And here is the answer I heard: 
  [Burkov] There were extremely stormy and lengthy debates. 
For 
two days they discussed the results of the first stage of 
privatization, the concept of the state program for 
privatization of state and municipal enterprises, and also 
problems of administration of state property. Today the process 
is regulated basically by presidential edicts, decrees of the 
Government of the Russian Federation, and directives from the 
State Committee on the Administration of State Property. 
Frequently they contradict one another, which is taken advantage 
of by people who want to get rich quick. The process of 
privatization must be placed on a stable legislative-legal 
foundation. 
  [Chernyshev] If I have understood you correctly, it will be 
necessary to place the appropriate legal base under the 
practical actions of the executive organs of power. 
  [Burkov] Action without laws or outside of laws is 
arbitrariness. It is typical of totalitarian, antidemocratic 
regimes. In Russia it is time to create a rule-of-law state. The 
preconditions for this are established in the constitution of 
the Russian Federation. The deputies are trying to determine 
clear-cut and distinct contours of the revival of the Russian 
economy and imbue it with a dynamic, highly effective nature. 
Every Russian citizen must stand firmly on his two feet. But now 
they do not feel that there is solid ground underneath their 
feet. 
  [Chernyshev] How did participants in the hearings evaluate 
the report from the chairman of the State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property, Anatoliy Chubays? 
  [Burkov] The report of the State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property mentioned quantitative 
successes above all. As of the present day up to 70 percent of 
the objects of small-scale privatization have been placed in the 
hands of private owners. On the basis of medium-sized and large 
enterprises about 12,000 joint-stock companies have been 
created. The voucher stage is being completed. The main thing 
now is the qualitative content of the process, its coordination 
with Russia's long-term interests, its revival, and the raising 
of the level of well-being of Russian citizens. But the deputies 
still have not received a clear picture. 
  As we know, in spite of the fact that even profitable 
enterprises are being privatized, the budgets at all levels are 
failing to receive a considerable share of their revenues. The 
standard of living of the population is declining and the 
economy is faltering. Much of the confusion and many complaints 
have been caused by the existing and clearly too low assessment 
of the value of the privatized property. This allows all kinds 
of "nearly privatized" fly-by-night firms to buy up considerable 
amounts of national wealth for token sums. 
  Tendencies toward artificial separation of large 
technological conglomerates into autonomous units have been 
discovered. For example, pressure on the collectives "from 
above" has evoked a sharply negative reaction at the Nizhniy 
Novgorod automotive plant, the Chebarkul metallurgical plant, 
and in the collectives of many other complexes that have been 
created and are functioning successfully as a unified whole. 
  The Duma quite pointedly raises questions of developing 
mechanisms on the administration of state property, restriction 
of the authority of the owner among organs of state power, and 
effective administration of state shares. 
  The first stage of privatization has taken place. What next? 
Unfortunately, the Government of the Russian Federation has not 
yet submitted the corresponding draft laws. 
  [Chernyshev] Do you have any kind of information about their 
content? 
  [Burkov] I cannot answer that until the draft laws have been 
submitted. But any civilized state must protect the rights of 
its citizens. It is extremely necessary, for example, to have 
strict state control over the activity particularly of check 
investment funds, and they must be audited continuously. 
  The activity of "Technical Progress," "Oil-Diamonds-Invest," 
and certain other structures, which evoked a storm of 
indignation, could disrupt the process from within. Whom are 
firms like these "investing in"--the domestic economy, the West, 
or their own pocketbooks? Unfortunately, privatization has 
brought about cases of abuse from the organs and workers of the 
State Committee on the Administration of State Property 
themselves, especially in the localities. The deputies are 
afraid that this mass of lawlessness could become critical. It 
is even being said openly that because of the corruption, 
impoverishment of the people, and unemployment there could be a 
social explosion. The legislators intend to clear the way for 
creative movement. 
  [Chernyshev] And how do you envision this path? 
  [Burkov] Dialogue, interaction, accord. Like the majority of 
deputies, I am convinced that the reforms that are being 
conducted must be coordinated with the entire order of public 
life and the Russian national character. This is the path of 
relying on our own forces, open and equal cooperation, 
harmonization of public life, and gradual formation of a market 
mentality. A certain "grab it" ideology has taken over now. We 
need new concepts, a new economic philosophy, the center of 
which is the working man. 
  Our committee recommended that the Government of the Russian 
Federation develop and submit to the Duma in the form of draft 
laws an integrated concept of privatization, the development of 
diverse forms of ownership, and a program for the corresponding 
actions. All segments of the population and not just individual 
parts or groups of it must be drawn into the movement toward a 
civilized market. 
  Alas, the executive power is still not letting go of the 
worst traditions of the command-administrative bureaucracy. 
Thus, for example, according to a schedule coordinated with the 
Government of the Russian Federation our committee was to have 
received a number of draft laws as early as March, but they are 
still not ready. As we know, the procedures for the work of the 
state Duma on draft laws take no less than two months. If the 
documents are submitted "for a vote" the deputies will be unable 
not only to study the documents but even to read them. Are some 
people really still living in those good old days when the 
entire hall "unanimously" raised their hands? What kind of 
democracy or profound and well-considered discussion can there 
be then? Such relations not only do not correspond to the 
constitution of the Russian Federation but also lead to conflict 
among the branches of power and a continuation of the situation 
of lawlessness. 
  [Chernyshev] And what laws do the real proprietors need? 
  [Burkov] They need laws that reinforce their creative energy 
and develop the market and democratic process. I am speaking 
about drafts of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, the 
package of laws "On Joint-Stock Companies," "On the State 
Enterprise," "On the Mortgage," "On Changes and Additions to the 
Law `On Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises,'" "On 
Administration of State Property," "On Securities and Stock 
Exchanges," "On Trustee Property (Trust)," "On 
Financial-Industrial Groups and Holding Companies," and possibly 
certain others. As one can easily understand, the laws must be 
adopted in packages, that is, one law cannot exist without 
another. Moreover, the package of laws must be formed for a 
specific state privatization program. And this is what we do not 
have. 
  [Chernyshev] Obviously it would be more reasonable to think 
about the path we have travelled and not rush forward recklessly. 
  [Burkov] Naturally. After all, even the deputies are asking 
the question--to what extent is privatization economically 
expedient? But we do not have a complete picture of where 
Russia's economy has arrived as a result of privatization. There 
is no register of state property. What proprietor can allow 
himself that? We do not even have an integrated set of 
statistics rather than individual ones on the financial 
condition of state and privatized enterprises. It is impossible 
to make any calculations. 
  I emphasize that the directives of the State Committee on 
Administration of State Property and other such acts are not the 
law. Therefore we need laws that protect the rights of the owner 
and regulate the privatization process. Nothing else is allowed 
in civilized rule-of-law states. 
  [Chernyshev] It seems to me that such laws should have 
already existed. 
  [Burkov] I hope that the arrears in legislative work caused 
by certain factors will still recede into the past. In any case 
our committee is aiming toward profound 
prognosticatory-analytical and at the same time operational work. 
  The only reliable compass in this is high quality of 
domestic 
legislation in the name of the revival of Russia and respect for 
the dignity and individuality of each Russian. 
  [Chernyshev] So our editorial office can get on the "hot 
line" where the readers can not only share what is bothering 
them but also make constructive proposals? 
  [Burkov] In any case, when developing decisions we will rely 
on the most diverse opinions of ordinary people, experts, and 
specialists. The extensive reader mail, the results of public 
opinion polls, expert assessments, and other channels of 
feedback can increase the "reserve of durability" of future laws. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  For those wishing to share their thoughts, observations, and 
proposals we give the "hot line" number of the editorial office: 
8 (095) 257-29-17.

<F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Solovyev, secretary of the Council of </F>
the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of the Russian 
Federation (FITUR): "Who Is Continuing the Game of Privatization 
Fool?"] 
  [Text] Privatization is one of the five most urgent 
problems of the present stage of shock therapy and stands right 
there in line--immediately following price liberalization, 
nonpayment of wages, stoppage of enterprises, and unemployment. 
A year or 18 months ago the working people hoped that the 
redistribution of property would, first, make it possible to 
obtain their due share of the socialist national pie and, 
second, be a boost to the development of production and a 
stimulus of a growth of production activity of both the owners 
of the means of production and the wage workers. But the 
practice of privatization under the leadership of the State 
Property Committee took a different route. A special edict of 
the president endowed the State Property Committee with the 
super-authority of a second government cabinet. More precisely, 
of the first, inasmuch as this decree itself took away, in fact, 
from all other ministers, the prime minister included, both the 
objects and levers of administration. 
  A series of subsequent presidential decrees and government 
decisions farmed out the actual mechanism and procedure of 
privatization wholly to super-officials of the State Property 
Committee, who both in the center and locally became the 
exponents of the fullness of power: giving away plants worth 
many billions of rubles, appointing directors, dismissing 
employees, selling fixed capital, and so forth. Not without 
compensation for themselves, of course. 
  It was here that real competition commenced both between the 
center and the local privatizers and within departments of the 
state property service as to who would "formalize" privatization 
facilities (that is, grant permits) more quickly and in greater 
volume (within the framework of the forced privatization 
program, one rate, in violation of the program, another, 
considerably higher). For additional "privileges" for this 
privatizing party or the other, special valuations. But we are 
not talking about this, about those who were admitted to the 
privatization pie (the government official and directors' 
nomenklatura, the new bourgeoisie). But about those who were not 
admitted to it, that is, all of us. 
  The popular notion that privatization Chubays-style has 
created tens of millions of property owners is being foisted on 
people. Even if we allow for the paltriness of the share of 
property that may be obtained in the process of the formation of 
stock companies by the able-bodied citizens of our country and 
those unfit for work, I dare say that not only have they not 
obtained anything, they have lost something even. And a 
considerable amount at that. 
  Popular wisdom says that you cannot, it would seem, lose 
what 
you do not have. On this basis citizens of our country in the 
socialist system truly not only did not have property, they were 
unable to have such. 
  But in those illustrious times the state undertook on the 
one 
hand, in accordance with the socialist constitution, to provide 
everyone with accommodations, work, pay, and so forth and, on 
the other, distributed via centralized social consumption funds 
all life's necessary social "benefits" assuring for everyone 
(other than the nomenklatura) equal conditions of survival: 
health care and health improvement, education and schooling, and 
so forth. 
  The inevitability of the demolition of a system to which we 
had become so accustomed was obvious to specialists from the 
moment of the market reforms. It was merely a question of how 
this would happen, with what economic and social losses and for 
whom. The incompatibility of the socialist rules of "social 
justice" with market conditions of management is graphically 
confirmed by the entire experience of Western countries also. 
  Privatization was chosen as the workhorse implement for the 
rapid and total destruction of both the economic basis of our 
state--public property--and also its social base--general 
wage-leveling and the social consumption funds. The first stage 
of privatization was geared to this and achieved its purpose. 
  It may already be said clearly and definitely at the 
completion of the first program of privatization who has 
obtained what and who has lost. I would distinguish three 
interested participants here: the state in the person of the 
organs of administration and the bureaucratic nomenklatura, the 
corps of directors as the economic nomenklatura, and all other 
citizens. 
  Understandably, the corporate interest for government 
bureaucrats amounted to ridding themselves of the onerous 
concerns connected with administration of a rotting economy with 
the maximum personal advantage. 
  For the corps of directors the interest amounted to changing 
from wage (albeit executive) labor into full masters of 
production. This was secured both by the appropriate privileges 
and the support of the state. 
  The most numerous party to the privatization process was 
distributed as follows: 
  --citizens unfit for work, who, aside from vouchers, 
obtained 
nothing (70-80 million retirees, handicapped children, and so 
forth); 
  --able-bodied citizens employed at enterprises not subject 
to 
compulsory (forced) privatization (45-50 million persons): 
persons in publicly funded institutions, the military-industrial 
complex, the agro-industrial complex, the army, students, and so 
forth may be attributed to the preceding group, in the main; 
  --employees of enterprises undergoing privatization (12-15 
million persons). 
  It is understandable that the first and second could merely 
sell their vouchers at a price nowhere near comparable either 
with the nominal share of public property or, even less, with 
that actually due to them, or invest them in roguish private 
investment funds. As last year's results showed, none of the 650 
private investment funds produced any substantial profit on its 
shares. And if a comparison is made with the selling price of 
the voucher and following indexation, there is evidence of the 
direct losses of the shareholders even of the "honest" private 
investment funds. The majority of private investment funds, on 
the other hand, frankly cheated its clients either by 
distributing dividends with their own stock or by simply making 
off with the balance of the money. 
  Aside from all else, the voucherization of society performed 
another, no less important, special assignment: It became an 
additional most powerful tool of the inflationary barrage of the 
end of 1992 and the start of 1993, which came crashing down on 
our economy in a R1.5 billion money issue. Inadequately 
controlled, what is more. 
  But... was privatization to the benefit at least of the 
fortunate ones who work at a privatized enterprise and who thus 
became its shareholders and full owners? Truly, the majority of 
production enterprises were privatized (on the initiative of the 
directors) according to the second version, and the work force 
obtained, as people are attempting to explain to us, very many 
"undeserved privileges." 
  In what are these privileges expressed? Is it not in the 
fact 
that the employee has obtained nominal title to part of the 
spindle from the machine tool at which he works (whereas certain 
directors obtained the real right to manage the activity of the 
enterprise)? 
  I dare say that the "fortunate ones" acquired nothing other 
than an extra yoke in an increase in the power of both the 
directors and bureaucrats from the State Property Committee. 
  Now, with the easily attainable compact of the latter, even 
the weakest guarantees of the labor rights of wage workers, to 
whom wages may not be paid for months on end, with whom a 
collective-bargaining agreement may not be signed, for whom 
social services are not provided, and for whom there need be no 
occupational safety, have disappeared. Finally, it is possible 
simply, in the absence of control, and with impunity to take 
away from the employee his job inasmuch as the manager of the 
enterprise is the real boss. 
  New vistas of the privatization tyranny are being revealed 
in 
the activation of the second privatization program (post-voucher 
stage), in the course of which the last curtains of social 
interests and national goals--the stabilization of production 
and a revival of the economy--are being lifted from the process 
of the shareout of the remnants of national property. 
  It is perfectly obvious that not only those unfit for work 
but also able-bodied citizens are no longer able even in 
fictitious form to join in the property-shareout process 
inasmuch as the continuing impoverishment of the populace and 
the devaluation of manpower which has occurred in recent months 
have conclusively undermined the possibility of employees with 
earned income participating in the property shareout. I would 
recall that one out of every 10 inhabitants of the country is, 
in fact, going hungry, one out of every five is below the line 
of the physiological subsistence level, and more than half are 
unable to provide for the survival (simple reproduction) of 
their families. Only 15-20 percent of citizens have wages above 
the minimum consumer budget. Thus only 5-7 percent of them can 
join in full in the process mapped out by the privatizers.... 
  The view of the past and future of privatization that I have 
expressed says, obviously, nothing that is fundamentally new. 
The trade unions expressed their position and forecasts of the 
social consequences of privatization back on the threshold of 
voucherization. They have, unfortunately, exceeded the direst 
expectations in terms of scale of the violation of the citizens' 
labor rights, in terms of the exacerbation of social conflicts 
in the soil of privatization, and in terms of the orgy of 
corruption and malfeasance.

<F P=106> [Article by Academician S. Alekseyev: "Private Property--A </F>
Factor No Less Powerful Than State Dictatorship"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Thus far privatization in Russia has failed </H5>
  What could explain the fact that "radical" economic reforms 
launched in January 1992, despite a number of positive results, 
still did not produce the anticipated changes and, on the 
contrary, certain tendencies appeared that could bring Russia 
more trouble? 
  The decisive factors, consideration of which may yield an 
answer to the question that was raised, are the unusual and 
historically unprecedented complexities of the economic and 
social situation in Russia, a country that is yet to make a 
final break with totalitarianism, one which is entirely 
nationalized and ravaged, where the foundations and culture of 
"normal" private ownership were wiped out and private property 
lost its significance as a natural base of economic development 
and where monopolistic state ownership, authority for the sake 
of authority, imperial state dictatorship, and a system of 
compulsory and semicompulsory stimulation of labor by the state 
was established. 
  "Free" prices and other monetary measures on the whole 
eliminated state dictatorship from the sphere of prices and 
trade turnover. On their own they are incapable of transforming 
the totally nationalized, bureaucratic, prosocialist economy 
into a free market economy, eliminating state pressure from it 
(which in many ways has changed its form: from a distributor of 
resources and goods the state became the distributor of 
subsidies and credits, which, by the way, requires huge taxes). 
  Radical reorganization of the entire Russian economy may be 
attained not only through monetary measures and market freedom, 
but primarily through the revival of private property as a 
natural basis of economic relations, production, and the entire 
economy, under conditions of competition, i.e., a factor, which 
is no less powerful than state dictatorship but one that has an 
inexhaustible reserve of creative energy, promotes natural 
motivation of labor and responsibility, while stimulating 
investments in production. 
  At the same time such a revival of private property capable 
of taking the place of the main regulator of production in a 
competitive environment did not occur in Russia. Official 
privatization, which it would seem should perform that task, was 
mainly limited to the sphere of trade and structures 
specializing in the marketing of natural raw material and 
currency operations abroad. With regard to the rest, however, 
attention in such "privatization" was focused on a prosocialist 
partition of a portion of state property among all 
fellow-citizens with the aid of vouchers (which, alas, 
intensified parasitical tendencies of "factory socialism") and 
sale of state property in the interests of the state budget as 
well as "general auctioning" promoted by the success of the 
partition of property using vouchers, which to a great degree 
acquired a formal character and often merely consolidated the 
status of "red directors," promoting the growth and legalization 
of our comprador bourgeoisie. 
  It was specifically because of the fact that privatization 
in 
Russia did not succeed and the dictatorial state command system 
was not replaced with another, natural, system of regulation and 
stimulation in the form of private ownership, that there was a 
failure in the economy, and formation of a void. It was 
specifically this failure which sent the parasitic "market" 
element spinning and churning, directed at quick and speculative 
profits achieved through the channeling of natural raw material 
abroad, resale, foreign currency operations, and machinations 
with vouchers, stocks, and credits. 
  Such a situation, a situation involving failure of the 
system 
of economic regulation and labor stimulation, precipitated 
processes leading to the destruction of the economy, a decline 
in production and labor productivity along with other alarming 
phenomena indicating the possibility that Russian society could 
degenerate into an unfavorable, tragic variant of capitalist 
development. 
  The alarming facts of our current reality are clearly 
evident, anyone can see them. Adherents of orthodox communism 
and a nationalized economy, as well as "proponents of the state" 
are utilizing these facts in full to substantiate the ideology 
of "turning back" to a "regulated" market, to a "mixed economy," 
or, in any case, to the "correction" and "slowing down" of 
reforms, and an intensification of state regulation in economic 
life. Unfortunately, under conditions of a disastrous situation, 
such moods have gained a certain popularity and even the support 
of some official circles. Even though, there is no doubt that 
such a policy would merely strengthen state-nomenclature type 
structures in the economy, increasing the state-capitalist tilt 
of one of the most unfavorable, dead-end variants of capitalist 
development. 
  One should assume that the way out of the situation which 
has 
been created must be a radically different one. Not "curtailing" 
or "slowing-down" of reforms but, on the contrary, attribution 
of a cardinal character to them and extension of reforms, their 
decisive conduct and involvement of the entire energetic, active 
population of Russia in that truly reformative process. 
  The key to such large-scale reformative activity is the 
revival of private property in a competitive atmosphere. Its 
revival in all of its forms -- individual, family, and private 
-- collective forms. 
  The very concept of privatization being conducted in Russia 
must be changed radically on the basis of these positions. 
  It is necessary to be firmly aware that under Russian 
conditions the revival of private property is impossible if 
privatization is concentrated on the free distribution of 
property, on the partition of even a segment of state property 
with the help of vouchers. By contrast with other countries, 
where truly private property already existed and privatization 
with the aid of vouchers merely consolidates and expands its 
subjective composition, under Russian conditions such a 
privatization policy only breeds consumer-parasitic moods, an 
aspiration of becoming a nonworking investor, along with 
elements of "factory socialism." 
  The direction which is presently coming into being in 
privatization -- the auctioning of items of state property on a 
competitive basis, can also hardly be recognized as satisfactory. 
  The optimal path for development of privatization, which 
revives productive private property and competition -- is the 
transfer of it to "real owners" and the acquisition of property 
by them for work. For work, that is for organization and 
modernization of rational modern production and a growing output 
of goods (services) in demand on the market. Perhaps the only 
obligation of the owner, naturally, along with the payment of 
taxes in such a transfer and such an acquisition, must be the 
obligation to modernize production and make mandatory 
investments of his own revenue in production. 
  It is necessary to note that with all of the alarming 
phenomena of the current period, favorable conditions still 
exist in Russia, probably uniquely favorable ones, for the 
economy to start working and take a path of dynamic development. 
They include the existence of significant material means, 
resources, and advanced technical and scientific potential in 
many areas. 
  Naturally, all of these are merely conditions, premises, 
which, in addition to everything else are being consistently 
lost, in the current crisis situation, as our economy is being 
destroyed, (they will not even be required very much in our 
Homeland if Russia slips into the unfavorable variant of 
capitalist development, the raw material periphery of the world 
capitalist system). 
  But the opportunity has not yet been lost and amazing 
results 
are still possible if our principal hope is realized -- the 
power of the Russian spirit and selfless labor. 
  We are all witnesses to how the elimination of the coercive, 
enslaving burden of the state, and the acquisition of freedom 
and private property are rapidly releasing labor energy, 
tumultuous and frenzied -- like everything Russian. 
  When production cooperatives and leased enterprises got the 
freedom to acquire private property in 1989-1991, the national 
economic sector formed by them, in the situation created by the 
disintegration of the entire Soviet economy which had already 
started, proved to be the only one (the only one!) that 
manifested economic growth, including a rise in investments in 
production. It is sufficient to recall the amazing success 
attained by the Pechora production cooperative, headed by 
Vladimir Tumanov, as well as the fruitful work done by other 
vigorous supporters of a realistic cause (Svyatoslav Fedorov, 
Nikolay Travkin, and others) in order for it to become clear 
that even at that time our national economy was on its way to 
resolving the crisis and heading toward a general economic 
upsurge. Who knows, that may have occurred if the reformist 
forces would have been firmer and more systematic and if Russia 
was not overwhelmed by political passions and the merciless 
struggle for power. 
  This is why it is necessary to have a clear understanding at 
present as well that revival of private productive property has 
been called upon to become the decisive ennobling factor, 
unleashing creative economic energy. 
  A daring and decisive step is required by the government and 
the president. By those who can and must assume responsibility 
for the fate of Russia, for making it possible to withdraw from 
the brink of disaster and begin healthy economic development.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Krotkov: "From One Scandal to Another: </F>
Farewell to the Voucher"] 
  [Text] The closer the country is to completion of the 
stage of voucher privatization, the more passions heat up around 
who will control the privatized property and on what terms. 
  For instance, a few days ago Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov 
issued a directive according to which "all rights with respect 
to managing Moscow property in enterprises' conversion to 
joint-stock holding and privatization" will be controlled by the 
capital city government. In keeping with the same document, the 
capital city government may take into trust management for a 
period of three years the shares of even those plants and 
factories that are federal property but until sold at auction 
are under the jurisdiction of the city property fund. 
  An interesting detail: The Moscow Government is willing to 
sell these shares before due time only in the event it finds it 
"economically expedient." The latter category, as anybody will 
agree, can be interpreted so broadly that the issue of selling 
will not arise at all--especially considering that Luzhkov, for 
purely political considerations, is afraid of the consequence of 
mass bankruptcy of major capital city enterprises, and in order 
to avert such a painful process will attempt, in the opinion of 
some, to stall the selling of shares through actions. 
  According to some reports, the head of the State Committee 
for Administration of State Property [GKI] reacted to the 
decision of the mayor--his old adversary--with extreme 
irritation. But an even greater headache for Anatoliy Chubays 
may be presented by the draft Law on Regulating Property in the 
Russian Federation, officially submitted for State Duma 
consideration by the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] 
faction. 
  According to this draft, the overwhelming majority of 
already 
completed privatization acts in Russia may be invalidated as 
illegal. Moreover, in the event of a low economic efficiency of 
denationalized enterprises, and "in instances of persistent 
noncompliance by the new owner with the terms of the 
privatization agreement... the object is to be deprivatized." 
  Keeping in mind that the production indicators of very many 
plants have declined after denationalization, their return to 
the state bosom (in the event this draft is approved) appears 
quite likely. Radical economists have already nicknamed the LDPR 
document the "Law on Deprivatization." 
  It would be naive, of course, to assume that the Duma, torn 
by controversy, will unanimously pass this law. However, the 
idea per se--to put privatization in reverse in instances where 
its economic effectiveness turned out, as they say, to have a 
minus sign, is currently becoming increasingly popular. 
  Meanwhile, in its blueprint of post-voucher privatization, 
Chubays' agency is planning the compulsory sale of the property 
of insolvent debtor enterprises at the demand of creditors. Only 
the labor collectives of privatized enterprises, which are 
vested with sufficient powers in keeping with the current 
legislation, can interfere in this process. 
  Even here, however, there is a surprise ready to be sprung 
on 
us: Chubays insists on substantially cutting preferences to 
labor collectives and, from his standpoint, considers even this 
tough approach a compromise--in the first draft of the concept 
of post-voucher privatization the wording was "no longer grant 
any preferences." 
  It is hard to judge at this point whose position will win 
this time. One thing is clear: The current battles between 
supporters and opponents of "privatization according to Chubays" 
may turn out to be insignificant compared to what may be coming 
in the future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rasul Guliyev by A. Gadzhizade; place and </F>
date not given: "Rasul Guliyev: `Those Jockeying for Power 
Accuse Me of Betrayal...'"] 
  [Text] At the initiative of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly, the Kyrgyz Republic parliament, the 
Federal Assembly, and the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, a meeting was held on 4-5 May in Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan). 
Among the meeting participants were A. Dzhalilov, first deputy 
chairman of Azerbaijan's Supreme Council; Armenian parliament 
speaker B. Ararktsyan; the head of Russia's mediating mission, 
V.N. Kazimirov; and Nagorno-Karabakh representative K. Baburyan. 
The result of the meeting was a protocol calling for "an end to 
armed conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and around it," which in 
place of A. Dzhalilov was signed by R. Guliyev. 
  [Gadzhizade] The president of the Republic of Azerbaijan and 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have not expressed an official 
opinion on the signing of the Bishkek protocol. How do you 
explain this? 
  [Guliyev] I signed this protocol with the consent and 
participation of the president of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 
  [Gadzhizade] What can you tell us about the content of the 
protocol? 
  [Guliyev] The purpose of the protocol is only a cease-fire 
and, being a protocol of intentions, it serves the truce in 
every way. We signed it in order to demonstrate Azerbaijan's 
peaceful intentions to the entire world community. Until this, 
Azerbaijan had often missed important diplomatic initiatives. 
  [Gadzhizade] How substantial are your amendments to the 
Bishkek protocol? 
  [Guliyev] In my opinion, the amendments to the Bishkek 
protocol are very significant and important. It is clear that 
"observers" mean CIS troops. And the mention of "international 
observers" says that this amendment is of an international 
nature, which proclaims the participation in peacekeeping 
operations of armed formations of foreign states together with 
CIS troops. The Azerbaijani side proposed that the wording 
"occupied territories" in the protocol be replaced by "seized 
territories," and this proposal was accepted. This is very 
important; it establishes that the other side is the aggressor. 
  [Gadzhizade] Many mass media maintain that 
Nagorno-Karabakh's 
participation in the negotiations means in fact recognizing it 
de jure. 
  [Guliyev] The contention that we have recognized 
Nagorno-Karabakh de jure is foolish, to say the least. One can 
see even from the protocol that the issue is not worth 
discussing. 
  [Gadzhizade] Your attitude to the peaceful settlement plan 
presented by Russia? 
  [Guliyev] Russia's plan for peaceful settlement of the armed 
conflict around Nagorno-Karabakh may be implemented only within 
the framework of the CSCE Minsk Group and under monitoring of 
international organizations. I will never sign a document that 
is contrary to the interests of the people. 
  [Gadzhizade] Some political figures and a score of parties 
called the signing of the Bishkek protocol a betrayal. What can 
you say regarding the accusation that you have betrayed 
Azerbaijan's interests? 
  [Guliyev] You know, statements by some political leaders and 
parties have no relation to the hopes of the people--it is 
simply jockeying for power. And in my opinion, in the current 
circumstances and situation a power struggle in itself is 
betrayal. 
  [Gadzhizade] What if the political circles demand your 
resignation? 
  [Guliyev] I would gladly resign, but the interests of the 
Azerbaijani people supersede my wishes. I will not resign until 
I fulfill my duty and my responsibilities. I will not allow 
ambitious individuals to play games with the fate of the people. 
  [Gadzhizade] Is the National Assembly supposed to ratify the 
Bishkek protocol? 
  [Guliyev] No. The Bishkek protocol was not signed for 
ratification because it is only a protocol, not an agreement or 
treaty. 
  [Gadzhizade] Many deputies are now collecting signatures for 
the purpose of convening the Supreme Council. 
  [Guliyev] I would like to tell the signature collectors that 
it has long been time to part with illusions. 
  [Gadzhizade] The next meeting of the National Assembly has 
been moved up to next week. What was the reason? 
  [Guliyev] This was necessitated only by the visit to Baku of 
the CSCE Minsk Group chairman, Mr. Jaan Eliasson.

Rossiyskiye Finansy V 1993 Godu (Russian Finances in 
1993) by B. G. Fedorov, Russian Federation Ministry of 
Finance, Moscow, January 1994] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  Dear Readers: 
  The review, "Russian Finances in 1993," is basically a first 
attempt at an integrated analysis of the state of Russia's 
financial policy and the past year's results from the standpoint 
of principles generally accepted throughout the civilized world. 
The review provides a great deal of data not published 
previously in our economic literature. 
  The review's main task is to tell the truth about Russia's 
financial policy in 1993, which was carried out consistently 
despite the opposition of the Supreme Soviet and a large part of 
the government. The new market-oriented financial policy went 
through and was adequately effective, although it could not 
solve all the problems against the background of the failures in 
the industrial and agrarian policies, which the reformers were 
unable to influence to an adequate extent. 
  The review is a unique Minfin [Ministry of Finance] report 
on 
the work performed and a response to criticism which was 
frequently unprofessional and incorrect. The arguments in 
defense of the chosen position are given in it, the necessary 
stresses are placed and conclusions are drawn about the reasons 
for the successes and the failures. Those problems which must be 
solved in 1994, in the event the chosen path continues to be 
followed, are defined at the end of each section. The Ministry 
of Finance's predictions about the development of the economic 
situation in the country in 1994 are given at the end of the 
review. 
  The most important conclusions are the following: 
  1) Over the course of 1993, the anti-inflation orientation 
of 
Russia's financial policy was maintained successfully on the 
whole and a substantial step forward was taken. At the same 
time, the most elementary analysis shows that there was not even 
a trace of any kind of "shock therapy." 
  2) Almost all the radical decisions have already been made 
and all that remained was to pursue the set policy calmly and 
consistently, to develop its set of tools and to construct the 
market institutes and mechanisms. 
  3) A market economy exists in Russia and it can be regulated 
by market methods, i.e., by cash or monetary methods. There is 
no real alternative to the policy pursued and there cannot be 
one. 
  4) The results would have been much more ponderable if the 
government and the TsB [Central Bank] had supported and carried 
out the announced financial and economic policies to the fullest 
extent. The Ministry of Finance alone cannot rebuild the entire 
country. 
  5) The change outlined in January of 1994 in the economic 
policy (shifting to mythical non-monetary methods, raising 
production through emission and abandoning basic financial 
discipline) is doomed to failure. The situation in the economy 
will inevitably worsen. It is impossible to regulate a market 
economy using state planning methods. 
  6) Any deviation may be only momentary and politically 
motivated. It is no longer possible to make a cardinal change in 
the course of the development of Russia's economy peacefully. 
However, the people will pay for the recoil out of their own 
pockets. The "Red Economic Managers" are again plunging the 
country into the abyss of withering disorganization and 
incompetence. 
  The review has been constructed primarily on the Russian 
Ministry of Finance's data, drawing on the materials of 
Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics], the Central Bank, 
the Ministry of Finance's Macroeconomics and Finances Group, 
Gosnalogsluzhba [State Tax Service], the Department of Tax 
Investigation and other governmental organs. Given in the 
appendices are the most important documents of the government's 
economic policy, memoranda to the government, document drafts, 
articles and Ministry of Finance press releases, which give an 
idea about the evolution of the views and approaches and the 
struggle for the reforms. 
  The review has been prepared in record time -- 2 weeks -- 
and 
this is why it inevitably contains deficiencies and errors. It 
is possible that individual aspects of Ministry of Finance 
activities have been left untouched and certain statistical data 
have not been published. The compressed preparation time was 
caused by objective reasons -- the change in the economic policy 
has already become a real threat. I hope that such reviews will 
become a tradition of the Russian Ministry of Finance and their 
quality will improve from year to year. 
  All of the Ministry of Finance's main departments and dozens 
of its staff members, as well as workers of my secretariat, as 
Deputy Chairman of the Russian Government, participated in the 
review's preparation. 
  I hope that this work will make its own contribution to the 
matter of the reforming of the Russian economy, which has as its 
sole purpose the improvement of the lives of the people through 
greater efficiency and rationality. 
  The victory of our approaches is inevitable! It is a matter 
of time.

  "Emission is opium for the national economy." -- G.Ya. 
Sokolnikov. 
<H5>  1. Basic Directions of the Financial and Economic Policies </H5>
<H5>  1.1. The Political and Economic Calendar </H5>
  The confirmation of V. Chernomyrdin as prime minister on 14 
December 1992 had been originally interpreted as a change in the 
economic policy, although the make-up of the government had 
changed little. The first actions -- the demand for additional 
credits for the TEK [Fuel and Energy Complex] and the adoption 
of a decree on the regulation of prices through profitability, 
confirmed this. However, the president and the government 
managed to restrain the pressure and to correct the situation 
and, in 1993, nearly all the government's official documents, 
especially program ones, were aimed at financial stabilization 
and continuation of the economic reforms. 
  The financial policy in 1993 can be divided into 5 stages: 
  -- the first is January-March; 
  -- the second is April-the beginning of July; 
  -- the third is July-September; 
  -- the fourth is September-12 December; 
  -- and the fifth is the end of December. 
  Distinguishing the stages has been associated with the 
political situation and the financial policy in each stage 
depended on one event or another. 
  The First Stage (January-March). This period can 
be conditionally characterized as the period of start of the new 
government's involvement in the matter, analysis of the 
situation and regrouping of forces. The decree on prices was 
abolished in point of fact; regular meetings of the Commission 
on Credit Policy began; the basic directions of the financial 
and economic policies for 1993 were officially adopted; many 
decisions were prepared, which were later adopted over the 
course of the year; and pressure began to be put on the Central 
Bank in order to force it to adhere to the anti-inflation policy. 
  Simultaneously, attempts were made to set up a constructive 
dialog with the opposition. The government participated in a 
"round table" and met with the Supreme Soviet's factions. The 
political background of the first stage was the decision of the 
7th Congress of People's Deputies on holding an All-Russian 
referendum on the new constitution's basic provisions and this 
decision's revocation by the 8th Congress on 13 March. 
  The first period's main result was a better 
understanding of the situation, the determination of priorities, 
the assessment of 1992's errors and the expansion of cooperation 
with international organizations and the "Big Seven." 
  The Second Stage. The arbitrary start of this 
stage is 20 March, the president's famous declaration, the 
announcement of the April referendum, and the intensification of 
the struggle with the Supreme Soviet. At this time, a turning 
point arrived, the Central Bank yielded to the pressure from the 
government and began to raise interest rates, the Ministry of 
Finance received the right to abolish import subsidies, for the 
first time, a quarterly limit on the centralized extension of 
credit was approved and the liberalization of coal prices was 
begun. On 20 April 1993, with the aid of a Supreme Soviet 
decision, the granting of technical credits to CIS countries was 
successfully stopped, something for which the Ministry of 
Finance had been fighting with the Central Bank since the 
beginning of the year. The stabilization of the currency 
exchange rate began. 
  The most important event during this period was the signing 
of a joint declaration on economic policy by the government and 
the Central Bank, which opened up the path to obtaining the 
first part of the MVF [IMF -- International Monetary Fund] 
system credit at the beginning of July, on the eve of the summit 
in Tokyo. The limits were maintained, the budget deficit was 
substantially restrained and, during this period, a real 
lowering of inflation began. At the beginning of June, the 
president's key edict on the rejection of new spending decisions 
in the second half of the year and the deferment of a number of 
budget payments was successfully issued. Unfortunately, it was 
not fulfilled, but it was extremely important. 
  At the same time, the government was unable to use the 
referendum's positive results to the fullest extent and the 
internal conflicts within the government intensified. On 
the whole, the second stage can be characterized as forward 
movement, although, by its end, the opposition forces had 
noticeably consolidated their forces, gambling on the events in 
May in Moscow. 
  The Third Stage actually began right after the 
summit meeting at the beginning of July in Tokyo and can be 
characterized as the stage of the recoil's beginning. During 
this period, taking into account the lack of practical steps for 
accelerating the reforms after the referendum, certain forces in 
the government, assisted by the Central Bank, launched a 
concentrated attack on the financial stabilization policy. The 
basic elements of this attack were: 
  -- the exceeding of the established limits on the 
centralized 
extension of credit; 
  -- the adoption of excessive purchase prices for grain, 
which 
deliberately wrecked the federal budget; 
  -- the Central Bank's unexpected conducting of a money 
exchange and then the continuous pressure with a view toward the 
rapid creation of a so-called ruble zone. 
  As a result, the inflation indicators soared again 
(especially in August because of the money exchange) and it had 
already become clear in August that the credit limits for the 
third quarter were being violated (an increase of 60 percent 
instead of 30 percent), even taking into account the use of the 
$1.5 billion received from the IMF. An appropriate letter was 
sent to the IMF and the hopes of obtaining the second part of 
the system credit in 1993 disappeared. 
  Since the end of August, the Ministry of Finance has 
persistently proposed sets of stabilization proposals which have 
basically included measures for reducing expenditures and 
increasing revenues. The government has repeatedly considered 
these proposals, but they were not adopted to the fullest extent 
in 1993. An increase in the pace of the reforms was not 
obtained. 
  This stage was characterized by an increase in tension in 
relations with the Supreme Soviet, which attempted to force the 
government to execute a budget with a many times larger deficit. 
The government used the presidential veto method in order to 
avoid fulfilling the Supreme Soviet's demand and falling into 
hyperinflation. 
  The Fourth Stage began with the issuing of 
Presidential Edict No 1400 of 21 September 1993 and the Supreme 
Soviet's dissolution. This made it possible, for a time, to 
change the course of events, in particular, to go on to the 
abolition of subsidized credits, to decide to liberalize the 
prices for grain and bread, to force the Central Bank to raise 
its rates, to lower the export customs duties and to reduce the 
export quotas. The president issued an edict on the budget for 
the fourth quarter, which made it possible to intensify the 
struggle against inflation. On 5 November, the prime minister 
signed a declaration on the economic policy at the end of 1993 
and in 1994, which could become the basis for accelerating the 
reforms. 
  However, the polarization within the government gradually 
intensified and the conflicts began to increase again. Instead 
of decentralizing the decision-making process, the prime 
minister attempted to concentrate in his own hands full control 
over the Commission on Credit Policy and other important 
directions. To some extent, this contributed to financial 
stabilization, since the approval of decisions was being dragged 
out for weeks and credits were not being granted. This stage's 
political background was the confrontation with the Supreme 
Soviet up to the events of 3-4 October and then the preparations 
for the elections. 
  The Fifth Stage was the period after 12 December 
1993. The election results were used by some as a signal for a 
shift in the financial and economic policies. Many of those who 
had sworn to be faithful to the course of the reforms began 
talking about the need for a greater social orientation and a 
change in priorities, making statements like "more therapy and 
less shock." As a result, almost nothing occurred during this 
period, although the desire to dip into the Central Bank's 
profits intensified and the consultations on the new make-up of 
the government began. 
  This shift in no way ensued from the year's actual economic 
results. And even the election results themselves were by far 
not as bad as some are trying to make them out, since the number 
of supporters of sensible financial and economic policies 
increased in comparison with the former Supreme Soviet. 
  The lack of a normally functioning parliament over the 
course 
of several months demonstrated the need for a counterweight to 
executive power -- dozens of new spending decisions poured out, 
including for the support of the apparat and unfounded and 
uncontrolled expenditures for purposes of no importance for the 
country. Unfortunately, the start of the Duma's work is still 
not inspiring optimism for the future. 
<H5>  1.2. The Ministry of Finance's Position </H5>
  The Russian Ministry of Finance, over the course of 1993, 
tried to pursue moderate financial and economic policies aimed 
at a relative reduction of the budget deficit, a tightening up 
of the monetary policy and corresponding measures in the 
currency sphere in order to reduce inflation. A concept was 
adopted, according to which: 
  -- under the conditions of high inflation, real investments 
and savings are impossible, the shortage of working capital and 
the non-payments will not disappear and a rise in production is 
impossible; 
  -- and, under the existing political conditions, it is 
impossible to achieve a radically rapid lowering of inflation, 
i.e., the tactics of progressive movement have been selected, 
especially since the market infrastructure has still not taken 
its final shape. 
  As is obvious, no kind of "shock" was envisioned. 
  A premise was adopted within the framework of this concept 
about the intolerability of mutual crediting and the 
replenishing of working capital through emission, since, in 
addition to the inflationary effect, this will slow down the 
structural reorganization and take away from the enterprises the 
incentives for increasing labor productivity and efficiency as a 
whole. An achievement of 1993 is the fact that we managed to 
avoid the crediting and indexing of working capital, although 
the Central Bank constantly pushed this idea and tried to 
persuade the government. 
<H5>  1.3. Several Myths </H5>
  Over the course of all of 1993, the greatest disputes were 
caused by the following questions which have been transformed 
into distinctive myths: 
  -- what is first, financial stabilization or a rise in 
production? 
  -- what is the nature of inflation in Russia? 
  -- and should there be more or less social orientation? 
  At the same time, the policy pursued by the government was 
declared to be monetaristic, a policy of shock therapy and so on. 
  The majority of the indicated myths are based on the 
opponents' lack of understanding of the basic ABC's of a market 
economy. A typical example of this ignorance is: prices in 1992 
increased by a factor of 26, while the M3 money supply increased 
by a factor of 10 and this means that there is not enough money 
in the economy. 
  The first myth springs from a basic principle of 
socialism -- the primacy of production over the sphere of 
services and turnover, which were declared to be secondary. This 
ordinary kind of logic says that, first, it is necessary to 
"raise" production and to produce goods and inflation itself 
will disappear. Any restriction of the deficit and credit is 
perceived as anti-production and even one which leads to an 
increase in inflation (for example, an increase in interest 
rates leads to an increase in prices). Such delusions are 
encountered in the West also and, in the twenties, People's 
Commissar of Finance G. Sokolnikov, surrounded by "Red Economic 
Managers," struggled with them. 
  The "supporters" of a rise in production always forget to 
say 
how they intend to raise it. Money and credits are needed for 
this and they can be obtained quickly only through an increase 
in the deficit and through emission, which will increase 
inflation and devalue investments and working capital, which 
will have to be replenished anew through emission and so on ad 
infinitum. The references to Keynes, Erhard and Japan are 
ignorant. No sensible person anywhere has recommended the 
stimulation of production through emission. In Germany and Japan 
after the war the budget deficits were not funded through 
emission. 
  The second myth consists of the incantation-like 
repetition by the executives of the Central Bank and others of 
the thesis that inflation in Russia is of a non-monetary, 
consumptive nature, which is associated with the high degree of 
monopolization of the economy and the absence of competition. 
The so-called "cost-push" inflation is set off against the 
"demand-pull" inflation (the inflation of the costs of 
production against the inflation of demand). 
  Actually, inflation does not have a single solitary cause 
and 
monopolism makes it possible to increase prices groundlessly. 
However, in our instance, it is evident that: 
  -- the degree of monopolization of the economy is rapidly 
diminishing; 
  -- competition is developing rapidly, including through 
importing; 
  -- and there is a proven direct connection between the size 
of the money supply and the rate of price increases. 
  It may be said with good reason that, in 1993, monetary 
factors made up something on the order of 70-75 percent of the 
inflation, while the remainder was made up of the expenditure 
mechanism, the currency exchange rate and other factors. The 
enterprises' behavior is becoming more and more market-oriented 
and they are beginning to draw closer to reducing expenses and 
increasing labor productivity as they understand that there will 
no longer be any free handouts from the state. 
  The third myth is associated with the allegations 
that the policy being pursued is shock therapy and a 
monetaristic experiment and does not have a social orientation. 
This also does not correspond to reality. 
  First, on the basis of any kind of criteria, it is 
impossible 
to regard as shock therapy a policy under which a budget deficit 
amounting to 10 percent of the GDP is being funded through 
emission, inflation over the year amounted to 900 percent, the 
public's monetary incomes and the average wages in all sectors 
increased faster than prices did, unemployment remained at the 
level of 1 percent, there are no bankruptcies and enterprise 
closings and the consumption of all types of foodstuffs and many 
consumer goods has increased. 
  Second, for the same reasons, the accusation of a harsh 
monetaristic policy is unfounded. The critics, in an absolute 
majority of instances, do not have the slightest understanding 
of monetarism as a theory and do not understand that, given the 
lack of desire on the part of the Central Bank and the lack of 
the basic instruments of a monetary policy, a real monetaristic 
policy is simply impossible. 
  We are at the stage where the broad variables of the economy 
are being brought into line with common sense. In order to do 
this, it is necessary: 
  -- to reduce the budget deficit and to fund it by civilized 
means; 
  -- to change the budget's structure, decreasing in it the 
share of inefficient subsidies; 
  -- to reduce centralized credit, converting it into normal 
refinancing, in favor of normal bank credit; 
  -- and to bring interest rates into line with inflation, 
thereby establishing a basis for savings and investments and so 
on. 
  At the same time, we are talking about eliminating to the 
maximum extent the factors which distort the effect of market 
forces and lower the effectiveness of state funding and monetary 
regulation: 
  -- the mass subsidizing of credits; import subsidies; the 
withdrawal from the budget of enormous sums in the form of 
non-budget-controlled funds, credits and subsidies; and tax 
breaks, currency benefits and foreign economic benefits; 
  -- the flight of capital; dollarization [the use of 
dollars]; 
and the gratis distribution of credits and cash in the ruble 
zone and the covert subsidizing of foreign states through prices; 
  -- and tax evasion and other items. 
  All this is necessary in order to convert the currency 
exchange rate, the interest rates, taxes and the budget into 
real economic regulators. Only after these tasks are carried out 
will it be possible to talk about the development of an actually 
refined monetaristic policy or some other monetary policy, when 
the struggle proceeds with the restriction of all credit and not 
just centralized credit. 
  The fourth myth is about the construction of a 
socially-oriented market economy. Based on the number of 
different socially oriented measures, Russia probably surpasses 
all the other countries of the world by several factors. There 
are the continuous indexing above the inflation level and the 
dozens of grants, benefits and subsidies. The problem is that 
the majority of these subsidies and benefits do not have a 
clearly identified recipient and are being distributed to 
millionaires and the really indigent alike. The benefits have 
been and are being given out irrespective of actual means and 
without consideration of available financial and other 
resources. If all the people were to attempt to come and to get 
all the benefits which exist on paper, then we would need two 
more budgets. 
  A significant portion of health care and education and a 
number of other areas, which had not been reformed even after 
the start of the reforms, are leftovers from the old system, 
which are attempting to survive under the new conditions. This 
means extremely low efficiency, inflated staffs, low quality and 
a lack of incentives. This is precisely why alternative 
educational and medical systems on a private and paid basis are 
spreading so swiftly. 
  This is why we should not talk about a mythical social 
orientation, but rather about a radical reform of social 
security, health care, education, increasing the specific 
tailoring of state assistance, public works, the support of 
small business, programs for retraining specialists and many 
other items. 
  The policy of financial stabilization and the policy of 
economic reforms have as the final goal only one thing -- 
raising the standard of living and the quality of life through 
production efficiency and maximum rationality in the 
distribution of financial and other resources. This is why any 
attempts to oppose financial stabilization and social protection 
are ignorant and shortsighted. 
<H5>  1.4. The Political Opposition </H5>
  The large problems of Russia's financial and economic 
policies in 1993 were associated with the complete lack of unity 
and basic financial discipline in the executive power, 
especially considering the continuous confrontation with the 
representative power. The pre-election struggle at year's end 
confirmed that the government, from the very start, was a 
coalition, uniting within itself people with diametrically 
opposed views, giving rise to constant conflicts. It is clear 
that achieving large results in this situation is complicated. 
  The undermining of the financial stabilization policy is 
directly associated with the continuous unfulfilled promises of 
the representative and executive powers. The Supreme Soviet 
continuously adopted deliberately impractical laws in the race 
for popularity in the eyes of the voters, wanting to annoy the 
government and the president as much as possible. It is 
staggering but, for example, the laws on grain, on social 
guarantees to the military personnel and on assistance to the 
northerners did not have the basic preliminary calculations and 
their full-scale implementation would have been a catastrophe 
for the country. 
  The executive power did not lag behind the Supreme Soviet. 
In 
1993, hundreds of spending decisions were made, for which no 
provision had been made in the budget. The referendum and the 
elections and any strike or threat of a strike gave rise to 
additional spending decisions. The attempt to freeze fuel prices 
before the referendum, the numerous gifts to students and 
academicians and the dozens of decrees on assistance to regions 
-- all these things were done through emission and they whipped 
up inflation. In the Supreme Soviet, they adopted the relay race 
of irresponsible indexing of wages, without having the means for 
this (for example, by a factor of 1.9 in December). The most 
important task of 1994 is to learn to live within our means. 
<H5>  1.5. Economic Resistance </H5>
  Finally, it is necessary to talk about the mutual relations 
between the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. Our 
Central Bank is a unique phenomenon in world practice, since, 
even despite the clear wording in the constitution and the laws, 
it resists the fulfillment of its own responsibilities in the 
struggle against inflation and adheres to the ideology of the 
"Red Economic Managers" and this is why it basically does not 
want to fulfill the functions of a real Central Bank. 
  Over the course of the year, the Ministry of Finance had to 
resort many times to the methods of public pressure on the 
Central Bank in order to force it to pursue a reasonable policy. 
On the whole, this was successful, especially when political 
factors helped, but this occurred with resistance, delay and 
provocations, although a mutual understanding did occur, as a 
rule, on the specialists' level. Without a solution to the 
problem of the Central Bank in 1994, it will be impossible to 
count on a successful financial and economic policy. 
  On the whole, based on 1993's results, it is possible 
to draw the following conclusions: 
  1. In 1993, the government pursued a more consistent and 
effective financial policy, which is confirmed by the specific 
results analyzed in the report. Russia's economy is rapidly 
reorganizing and it can be regulated using market-oriented 
methods. 
  2. The inadequately perceptible results, first of all, are 
explained by the executive power's internal conflicts, the lack 
of understanding and the unwillingness of part of the leadership 
to carry out the needed reforms and the incompatibility of the 
financial, agrarian and industrial policies. 
<H5>  2. The Year's Basic Economic Results </H5>
  In 1993, it was not possible to sustain fully the financial 
and economic policies' orientation toward lowering inflation and 
stabilizing the economy. Therefore, although we avoided the 
"Ukrainization" of the Russian economy, the majority of set 
parameters was not achieved. 
  At the same time, within the framework of this moderate 
policy, some progress was achieved: 
  -- the rate of inflation in December amounted to less than 
13 
percent per month in comparison with the 25-30 percent at the 
beginning of the year, but the trend was not clear and a strong 
burst of inflation was noted in the summer; 
  -- the ratio of net domestic assets to the GDP decreased; 
domestic funding of the budget deficit decreased from 19 percent 
in 1992 to 5 percent and foreign funding decreased from 17 
percent to 4 percent; 
  -- the ruble exchange rate stabilized and approached parity 
with purchasing power; wages increased in terms of dollars; 
import subsidies were eliminated and the transition to a single 
exchange rate was completed (the ratio of import subsidies to 
the GDP decreased from 12 percent to 1 percent); 
  -- interest rates, including those for deposits, converged 
with the level of inflation and became favorable in December; 
thus, the conditions for the resumption of saving and investing 
were created; 
  -- and the process of transferring covert subsidies into the 
budget was begun (for example, CIS credits, the share of which 
in the GDP decreased from 6 percent to less than 1 percent). 
<H5>  2.1. The Development of Inflation Processes </H5>
  It is possible to distinguish two stages in the development 
of 1993's inflation: from the beginning of the year to July and 
from August to December. The rate of increase dropped in March 
through June and later in September through December. At the 
beginning of the year and in August, the rate of increase in 
prices reached almost 30 percent per month. Over the year as a 
whole (from December to December), prices increased by an 
approximate factor of 10 as against a factor of 26 in 1992. 
  The development of inflation processes in the first half of 
the year occurred to a large extent due to the influence of the 
emission inflation of the money turnover in the fall of the 
preceding year after conducting mutual crediting of the debts of 
state enterprises and other decisions which intensified 
inflation expectations. This period was characterized by a rapid 
increase in the turnover rate and a simultaneous increase in 
inflation and the dollar exchange rate. As a result, by spring, 
the flight from the ruble to foreign currencies had begun to 
take on a threatening nature and holding on to available 
currencies became a method of saving for the people. The rate of 
dollarization continued to increase until June, when foreign 
deposits amounted to 46 percent of the money supply as against 
19 percent in January of 1992. 
  Slowing down the development of this dangerous trend was 
managed successfully thanks to the shifting of new streams of 
foreign currency into the currency market, the rise in interest 
rates and the shrinking of the deficit and the credit supply 
(see the section on the currency policy [5.1.]). As a result, 
the exchange rate stabilized, the dollar inside the country 
began to depreciate and the flight from the ruble eased up. The 
currency deposits in August amounted to 29 percent of the money 
supply. The Central Bank began to raise intensively the rate for 
refinancing, which became favorable by year's end, this 
stimulated an increase in deposit interest rates and the 
inclination toward saving began to increase. 
  As a result, the degree of monetization of the economy began 
to increase and the rate of inflation began to decrease but the 
Ministry of Finance began to be subjected to ever fiercer 
pressure. The demands for money, subsidies and loans 
intensified. The on-going events make it possible to draw the 
conclusion that what is taking shape is a distinctive, 
economy-straining inflation cycle: as soon as favorable results 
are successfully achieved, due to the pressure of the sectorial 
lobbies and political events, there follows a breakdown which 
then makes it necessary to intensify anew the struggle against 
inflation. 
  It is believed that the hyperinflation threshold is at the 
level of 50 percent per month. In point of fact, even an average 
rate of inflation of 20 percent per month is catastrophic. 
Russia has been living under the conditions of hyperinflation 
for 2 years now and one achievement of the policy pursued is the 
fact that the situation has not become much worse. If decisive 
measures are not adopted in 1994, then savings, investments and 
the development of the economy as a whole will be in great 
danger. Without the renewal of fixed capital and without capital 
investments, the economy will continue to stagnate, precluding 
the possibility of raising the people's standard of living. 
  The state budget's gigantic deficit, funded almost 
exclusively through Central Bank emissions, remained the main 
cause of inflation in 1993. Among the other most important 
"monetary" causes of inflation, it is possible to isolate the 
following: 
  1) The increase in the rate of turnover of money as a result 
of inflation expectations. The decrease in the supply of money 
did not lead to a proportional decrease in inflation, i.e., the 
rate of turnover increased. The interrelationship is: Central 
Bank emission -- the monetary base -- the aggregates of the 
money supply; inflation in 1993 assumed a stable nature. Central 
Bank credits over the course of 1 month are reflected in the 
increase of the monetary base and the aggregates, while changes 
in the aggregates, with a lag of 3- 4 months with consideration 
of the change in the rate of turnover, have telling effects on 
the rate of inflation. 
  2) The increase in the Central Bank's net purchases of 
currency (the monetization of foreign assets) and, 
correspondingly, the increase in Russia's net international 
reserves were accompanied by a ruble emission not included in 
the quarterly limits established by the Commission on Credit 
Policy.

Explanation: The monetary base is calculated as the amount of money in 
circulation, required reserves and funds in Central Bank basic accounts. The 
multiplier is estimated as the quotient from the division of the M2 monetary 
aggregate by the value of the monetary base. The rate of turnover is 
calculated at the monthly GDP (at the end of a period) in annual terms 
divided by the M2 monetary aggregate. 


  3) The increase in the multiplier. In 1993, an insignificant 
increase was noted in the multiplier, which also contributed to 
the saving of credit resources and an increase in the money 
supply. This was a consequence of the commercial banks' 
reduction of their own surplus reserves. In 1993, a recution 
occurred in the commercial banks' surplus reserves from 37 
percent of the total ruble deposits in January of 1993 to 23 
percent by year's end, which increased the supply of money in 
the economy. 
  4) Not all commercial banks are observing the requirements 
for the quota of required reserves, which amounts to from 15 
percent to 20 percent depending on the term of the deposit. It 
is precisely this portion of the ruble deposits which should be 
held by the commercial banks in an interest-free account in the 
Central Bank. According to the statistical data, at the end of 
1993, only 11 percent of the total ruble deposits was being held 
as reserve requirements. 
  Non-observance of the established rules also increased the 
opportunities for the commercial banks to grant credits. In 1993 
liberalization of coal prices was implemented, unregulated 
prices for oil were increased and wellhead gas prices were 
indexed. With the establishment of RAO YeES [Russian Joint-Stock 
Company Unified Power System], as of the summer, a rapid 
increase in the tariffs for electricity began. However, the 
impact of these factors on inflation was not of an evident 
nature. No substantial correlation was observed between 
inflation and energy prices. The level of inflation did not 
reveal a tendency to increase after significant increases in 
energy prices. Rather, the understated prices for energy had an 
inflationary effect on the economy. 
  The combination of fixed or limited prices for energy and 
high domestic inflation leads to the need for large state 
subsidies to producers, which stimulates an increase in 
inflation. On the whole, the inflation process was determined by 
the monetary policy, the budget policy and the amounts of the 
non-payments to the Fuel and Energy Complex. This testifies to 
the fact that maintaining high rates of inflation against the 
background of a real reduction in the money supply cannot be 
explained as an intensification of its non- monetary factors. On 
the contrary, this is the result of the rapid monetization of 
the economy. Statistically, the dynamics of inflation are 
explained highly reliably by inflation expectations and the 
increase in the money supply, i.e., monetary factors are 
prevailing, which are unclear to the economic managers and 
bankers, who have not studied a market economy. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-004L-09A>      Figure 1. Inflation and the Dynamics of the M2 Money Supply </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-004L-10A>      Figure 2. The Size of the Actual Money Supply (December 1992 = 1) </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-004L-11A>      Figure 3. The Dynamics of the Actual Money Supply and Industrial Production (January 1992 = 1) </FIG>



  The attempts to explain the dynamics of the wholesale prices 
as the result of a rise in the cost of material expenditures are 
unsound. Given the formally obvious connection between 
expenditures and prices, there is no evidence for the prevalence 
of this factor. The increase in prices for many goods rests on 
demand and the competition from more inexpensive imported goods. 
Many enterprises are reacting to the increase in expenditures 
for energy resources with non-payments rather than with 
bankruptcies. The greater the possibilities are for 
non-payments, currency and other benefits and centralized 
credits, the less efficient production is and the more room 
there is for inflation's non-monetary factors. 
<H5>  2.2 Incomes and Wages </H5>
  A positive trend of 1993 was the restoration of the dynamics 
of the increase in the actual level of the public's monetary 
incomes after their twofold decrease in 1992. The nominal 
incomes increased by an approximate factor of 11.1, while prices 
increased by an approximate factor of 10. The public's real 
incomes increased by approximately 10 percent, while wages in 
terms of dollars increased by a factor of 3 or up to $100 per 
month (by a factor of 9 in comparison with the end of 1991), 
which is much more than, for example, in Ukraine. The 
convergence of domestic and world prices contributed to an 
increase in the availability of imported goods. On the whole, in 
1993, the increase in average wages in nearly all sectors 
exceeded the increase in consumer prices. 
  However, under the conditions of maintaining high rates of 
price increases, the people of Russia have constantly borne the 
burden of the cruelest inflationary tax, which empties out the 
consumers' pockets. The result was an insignificant increase in 
real monetary incomes, especially among the low-income sections 
of the public. In essence, the income policy of 1992, which led 
to the sharp differentiation of incomes, was continued. 
  Nominally not restrictive, it led to real disproportions in 
the system for the distribution of incomes, creating 
opportunities for their accelerated increase in the production 
sphere and maintaining the "outsider" status of the 
budget-controlled workers. The sporadic attempts to reduce this 
disparity caused an increase in the budget deficit, then -- an 
inflationary tax, and later a reproduction of the disproportions 
at the new level of prices and incomes occurred. 
  The launching as of the end of 1992 of a legislatively 
authorized indexing mechanism made it possible in 1993 to reduce 
the lag of fixed incomes behind unregulated ones, but it 
basically did not change the situation. The mechanism's 
imperfect nature and its use in the political struggle gave rise 
to new, absurd disproportions in the distributions (for example, 
a two- to threefold increase in the minimum pension and the 
minimum wage). The intersectorial differentiation in wages 
intensified, which intensified the social discontent. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-004L-13A>      Figure 4. The Actual Level of the Public's Incomes, Average Wages, Pensions and Allowances in </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-004L-14A>      Figure 5. The Level of Indexing </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-004L-15A>      Figure 6. The Average Monthly Wages for the National Economy in U.S. Dollars (Based on the </FIG>


  The structure of the people's monetary incomes changed -- 
the 
proportion of wages increased from 70 percent to 75 percent with 
a simultaneous drop in the share of social payments (pensions, 
allowances and stipends) from 22 percent to 14 percent while the 
incomes from the financial system were maintained at an 
extremely low level -- 3.5 percent (14 percent in 1991 and 4 
percent in 1992). The people's incomes from the sale of 
agricultural products increased from 4 percent to 7 percent. 
These trends, on the whole, correspond to the normal development 
of market relations. 
  The main result, even though it went contrary to the 
government's wishes, of the income policy pursued in 1993 
consisted of the inflationary redistribution of incomes between 
groups of the population without substantial changes in the 
dynamics of the total actual amount of incomes. Despite the 
seasonal tendency toward the acceleration of the increase in 
monetary incomes in the fourth quarter, their average monthly 
amount in real terms up to year's end remained almost at the 
level of the fourth quarter of 1992. 
  Inflation is objectively leading to the polarization of 
society, to the disappearance of the middle class and to an 
increase in the disparity between the rich and the poor. The 
opposition was unable to understand this, attributing everything 
to the results of the reforms. At the same time, the proposals 
of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labor regarding 
the introduction of tax regulators in order to reduce the 
differentiation in incomes invariably ran into resistance. 
  It must also be noted that a tendency toward a real increase 
in consumption was noted in 1993. For example, the consumption 
of all types of foodstuffs increased in comparison with 1992 and 
also for many of them in comparison with 1991. Signs of an 
improvement in the structure of consumption appeared -- the 
share of foodstuffs in the retail goods turnover decreased from 
56 percent to 53 percent and the sales of many industrial 
consumer goods increased, although this occurred frequently due 
to importing. 
  At the same time, the actual volume of services used fell 
quite strongly. It is precisely in this area that the inflation 
of costs acquired important significance since the subsidies to 
the housing and municipal services complex, passenger tranport, 
health care, education and communications were reduced, spending 
for energy resources increased and many enterprises of the 
service sphere were closed or reconfigured after their 
privatization. A new sphere of services developed swiftly, but, 
for the time being, it is geared basically toward society's 
prosperous strata. 
<H5>  2.3. The Public's Savings </H5>
  In 1993, we failed to overcome negative trends: the 
extremely 
low rate of saving; the inadequacy of savings for the 
stimulation of investments; and the uncivilized nature of the 
majority of methods of saving. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-004L-17A>      Figure 7. The Dynamics of the Basic Types of the Public's Monetary Assets in 1993 (January 1, </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-004L-18A>      Figure 8. The Public's Inclination Toward Consumption and Saving. (The Relationship of </FIG>


  The low rates of the population's real monetary incomes, the 
unfavorable interest rates for deposits, the constant inflation 
expectations and the lack of basic investing know-how are the 
main reasons for the low savings activity. Nevertheless, in 
1993, the process of the accumulation of monetary assets using 
civilized methods intensified somewhat and the average annual 
indicator of the inclination toward saving came to more than 6 
percent as against 3.8 percent in 1992. 
  The Ministry of Finance constantly exerted pressure on the 
Sberbank [Savings Bank] in order to force it to raise the 
interest rates for the public's deposits. To this end, a portion 
of the state's debt to the Savings Bank was repaid. An 
especially substantial increase occurred at the beginning of the 
year and in October. As a result, especially marked positive 
changes were noted at the end of the year, when the rates 
converged with inflation. 
  The rapid increase in the public's deposits in banks 
testifies to the high elasticity of the amount of monetary 
deposits of natural persons in relation to the interest rate 
level and the expansion of the range of banking services 
offered. The Savings Bank's role is continuously diminishing 
due to the commercial banks, which are offering their services 
more and more widely, at least to the prosperous layers of the 
population. According to estimates, in 1993 the amount of the 
public's deposits in commercial banks increased by a factor of 
32, while their share in the overall amount of the public's bank 
deposits on 1 January 1994 came to around 27 percent as against 
7 percent at the beginning of 1993. 
  Substantial assets of the population went into stocks and 
other obligations (AVVA and Olbi-Diplomat), for which lines have 
formed. The public's inexperience caused the widespread 
propagation of dubious companies which are attracting the assets 
of small investors (for example, the Russian House of Seleng). 
In many instances, these forms of investments do not differ from 
savings in their economic content. 
  The legalization and expansion of the currency market 
stimulated in the year's second half the redistribution 
processes in the ready cash portion of the public's assets. The 
ratio of the increase in ready cash in the public's hands to the 
disposable incomes decreased from 15 percent on average in 1992 
to 11 percent in the third quarter of 1993 and to 8-9 percent at 
year's end. However, ready cash remains an important part of the 
public's savings, which testifies to the lack of understanding 
of the impact of the inflation tax, the lack of skill in 
investing and the lack of faith in the credit system and 
securities. 
  The decrease in the growth of ready cash in rubles was 
partially compensated for by the increase in spending for the 
purchase of foreign currency in commercial banks for protection 
from inflation. In the second half of the year, these 
expenditures amounted to 8-10 percent of the people's incomes as 
against 2 percent in the first quarter of 1993. At the same 
time, this phenomenon is partially explained by the legalization 
of the currency turnovers of the "black market." 
  Private importing, especially that of small merchants, is 
noticeably geared toward the use of foreign currency. In 1993, 
the share of consumer spending in currency increased, i.e., 
"dollarization" continued to intensify. Under the conditions of 
high inflation and the high liquidity of cash currency, the 
increase in currency assets, to a significant extent, acted not 
as a method for saving, but rather, as a method for maintaing 
the public's "current cash fund" for payments for services and 
goods. It is clear that this cash fund is better protected from 
inflation than a ruble cash fund. 
<H5>  2.4. The GDP, Production and Employment </H5>
  The production of the GDP in Russia in current prices as a 
whole in 1993 amounted, according to preliminary data, to around 
162 trillion rubles [R], while the physical volume was around 88 
percent of 1992's level. 
  The need for a structural reorganization of industry, the 
loss of markets, the reduction in subsidies and preferential 
credits, the high inflation, the political and economic 
uncertainties, the inertia of the leaders, and the lack of 
incentives for increasing efficiency made the slump in 
production inevitable. 
  In 1993, industrial production in current prices amounted to 
R109.4 trillion. The physical volume of production had decreased 
compared to 1992 by 18 percent, while, in the third and fourth 
quarters, the level of production stabilized relatively at the 
level of 65-70 percent of the first quarter of 1992. Capital 
investments from all sources amounted to 85 percent compared to 
1992. 
  The structure of production is slowly but surely changing 
and, in a number of sectors, there are changes associated with 
the change in demand and the expansion of exporting 
opportunities. The slump is of an ever more clearly structural 
nature. The slump is greater in machine building and light 
industry, which are producing an enormous amount of 
noncompetitive products which are being replaced by imports. The 
picture is similar for certain foodstuffs and products of light 
industry. At the same time, the production of fuel and raw 
material resources decreased substantially less, including in 
connection with exporting opportunities. The production of 
individual types of complicated household equipment increased. 
Residential housing starts using all sources of financing 
increased by 1 percent, although a significant portion of 
housing construction has simply not been taken into 
consideration. 
  The overall number of persons out of work and actively 
seeking it, as well as of those working part-time, amounted at 
year's end to 8.0 million people or 10.4 percent of the active 
population. In accordance with the methodology of MOT [ILO -- 
International Labor Organization], 3.8 million people (5 
percent) can be classified as unemployed. At the beginning of 
1994, 836,000 people or 1 percent of the economically active 
population were officially classified as unemployed. At the 
beginning of 1993, this indicator came to 577,000 people (0.6 
percent). 
  High inflation and the distribution of preferential credits 
did not prevent the production slump. The inadequately 
consistent monetary policy caused some drop in the actual money 
supply, but it did not ward off the high inflation expectations 
and this is why it intensified the scale of the industrial slump. 
  In the sphere of macroeconomic regulation, a practice 
extremely adverse from the economic point of view arises when 
periods for a real reduction in the scope of the emission 
inflation of the economy are replaced by the expansion of 
credits and the budget deficit. The expansion of the money 
supply just for a short period stimulates an increase in 
production, but it rapidly speeds up inflation and inflation 
expectations. The inevitable measures which follow this for 
restricting credits and inflation cause a reduction in the 
actual money supply and a more substantial slump in production. 
  As a result, the wave-like movement of credits and the 
periodic change in the vector of the harshness of the monetary 
policy lead to an unending slump in production. The 
inconsistency in the monetary policy will never make it possible 
to stabilize production and, in some countries, the governments 
of which adhered to such a policy for many years, the matter 
ended in deindustrialization and the loss of the industrial 
potential base. The last 2 years of reforms have demonstrated to 
the fullest extent the futility of such a policy. 
  It is necessary to take into account the fact that the 
indicators for production, the people's incomes and inflation 
cannot currently be considered to be entirely reliable. There is 
every reason to assume that the data published by the 
statistical organs concerning production do not take into 
account a significant part of the products produced and sold 
(previously, they devoted themselves to padding the accounts and 
now they are devoting themselves to understating them). This is 
being done in order to evade taxes and to obtain additional 
revenues. 
  Many methods have appeared for understating paid monetary 
compensation and for using material incentives (for example, 
leased vehicles, apartments and free meals), paying wages 
through savings accounts, which are untaxed, the use of benefits 
for the construction of individual housing, travel allowances, 
expense accounts, the distribution of securities, the depositing 
of a portion of the wages abroad and dozens of others. 
  Many new private enterprises will not fall into the 
statistician's field of view for a long time, since their number 
has increased by hundreds of thousands. For example, just in 
Moscow, over 2 years, the number of taxpayers increased from 
40,000 to 250,000. 
<H8>  Tasks for 1994 </H8>
  1. The main goal formulated on the government's plan for 
intensifying the economic reforms is the attainment of 
substantially lower inflation (3-5 percent per month by year's 
end). 
  2. A subsequent reduction in the Central Bank's net credits 
for funding government expenditures of up to 3-4 percent of the 
GDP. 
  3. A subsequent lowering of inflation expectations and the 
creation of conditions for stimulating accumulation. 
<H5>  3. The Budget Policy </H5>
<H5>  3.1. The Budget Process </H5>
  The government's budget policy and the Ministry of Finance's 
position on this matter were one of the sharpest points of 
conflict of the different opinions, around which passions 
seethed all year long. 
  The unsettled nature of the relations between the 
legislative 
and executive powers in the first half of 1993 led to the 
wrecking of the deadlines for the adoption of budget legislation 
and frequent adjustments of it occurred. The Russian 
Federation's republic budget for 1993 was approved by the 
Russian Federation [RF] Law No 4968-1 only on 14 May 1993. The 
measures undertaken by the government in the area of the pursuit 
of a restrained financial policy were not supported by the 
deputies, rather, on the contrary, attempts were undertaken to 
increase state spending without consideration of the state's 
financial condition. In order to do this, the unfounded 
forecasts of the macroeconomic indicators, which were based on 
overstated data about the receipts of revenues into the budgets 
of all levels, were foisted on the government. 
  The fulfillment of all the decisions of the VS [Supreme 
Soviet] could have led to the growth of the federal budget 
beyond the limits, which would have caused a colossal 
intensification of inflation and the final destruction of the 
country's financial system. In the summer, the government, 
supported by the president, refused to carry out the July 
refinements of the law on the budget, which were adopted by the 
parliament, according to which the deficit would have exceeded 
the total amount of revenues. This position was reflected in the 
RF Presidential Directive No 2234 of 12 August 1993. 
  The final period mark in the budget planning was written by 
Presidential Edict No 2234 of 21 December 1993 on Refinement of 
the Indicators of the Russian Federation's Republic Budget for 
the Fourth Quarter of 1993, which established the procedure for 
funding budget expenditures within the limits of the actual 
receipt of revenues and for the involvement of Central Bank 
credits while observing the established budget deficit limit. 
This meant, first, the priority funding of the protected 
spending items. And second, keeping the amount of the 
expenditures within the limits determined by the total budget 
revenues and Central Bank credit. At the same time, the amount 
of credit had been severely restricted beforehand in the 
calculations for the upcoming quarter and month. 
  Thus, additional restraining of the increase in state 
spending was accomplished, which made it possible for the 
government to avoid going beyond the agreed bounds of the limits 
for the increase in indebtedness for Central Bank credits and to 
restrain the increase in the supply of money in the economy. 
This system of using the budget was of critical importance for 
the realization of the entire anti-inflation program. 
  At the same time, the established practice for the 
organization of budget funding had obvious shortcomings. It made 
the use of budget resources unstable and insufficiently 
systematic, inasmuch as, for many items, there occurred a 
substantial restriction of expenditures, which occurred 
unexpectedly for the recipients of budget funds. The acute 
problem of the underfunding of planned expenditures included in 
the republic budget emerged. The various sections of the budget 
turned out to have been funded to varying degrees. 
  The indicated shortcomings were a heavy but unavoidable 
price 
to pay for a policy of limiting the budget deficit under 
conditions when expenditures were not adequately supported by 
revenues and, first and foremost, by the tax receipts. However, 
the Ministry of Finance's moderate policy, which was aimed at 
limiting the state's expenditures over the course of the year, 
yielded fruit in the form of a lowering of inflation in November 
and December. 
<H5>  3.2. The Tax Policy </H5>
<H5>  3.2.1. Tax Legislation </H5>
  Russia's tax legislation did not undergo substantial changes 
in 1993. However, because of the change in the rate for the 
value-added tax (NDS [VAT]), over the course of the year changes 
in the structure of the tax revenues occurred: the share of 
indirect taxes decreased and the share of direct taxes, 
including payments associated with the use of natural resources, 
increased. 
  At the end of 1993, two presidential edicts were adopted, on 
changes in the taxation of natural and legal persons who, on the 
one hand, contributed to the improvement of the tax legislation 
and the elimination of "loopholes" in it and, on the other hand, 
supported the set of mutually balancing decisions on increasing 
the tax rates (on profits, value added and property) and the 
narrowing of the tax base or the expansion of tax breaks. The 
basic changes were as follow: 
  1. An increase in the brackets of income groups for the 
taxation of the incomes of natural persons; 
  2. A potential opportunity for increasing the corporate 
profits tax rate (at the discretion of the regional authorities) 
from 32 percent to 38 percent (to 43 percent for banks and 
insurers) or decreasing it down to 13 percent. At the same time, 
changes occurred in the calculation of the taxable profit, which 
lead to a reduction in the tax burden for enterprises despite 
the tax rate increase: 
  a) there was a revaluation of fixed capital (by a factor of 
26 on average), which led to an increase in depreciation 
allowances and a decrease in profits with an increase in the 
resources remaining at the enterprises; 
  b) the standardized wage level was increased from four times 
the minimum wage to six times the minimum wage and any excess 
above this level is subject to the profits tax; a change was 
made in the procedure for ultrahigh taxation (at the rate of 50 
percent) of a wage level higher than eight times the minimum 
wage; together with an increase by a factor of 1.9 in the 
minimum wage, this led to an increase in the standardized wage 
level by a factor of 3. According to estimates, the impact of 
this factor alone is equivalent to a reduction in the profits 
tax burden by approximately 20 percent. 
  3. Tax breaks are being introduced for enterprises which 
invest assets in production development and social construction: 
  a) exempted from taxation are enterprise profits directed 
toward these goals using the proportional financing procedure, 
but not directly, and profits directed toward paying off 
long-term bank credits obtained in order to solve investment 
problems; 
  b) exempted from taxation are bank profits from the granting 
of special purpose long-term investment credits, which will make 
it possible for banks to lower the interest rates for the issued 
credits; 
  c) the time frame for recovering the value-added tax amounts 
paid by enterprises when purchasing equipment has been reduced 
from 2 years to 6 months; when equipment is imported, the VAT 
amounts are written off once only when the equipment is placed 
into service; 
  4. In order to compensate partially for budget losses, a 
special purpose fee is being introduced to support the national 
economy's most important sectors at a rate of 3 percent, as well 
as excise taxes on certain types of goods; 
  5. Real steps have been taken to federalize the tax system: 
the rights of federation entities and local organs of power in 
establishing tax rates and impositng new taxes have been 
expanded and the basic principles of budget federalism in Russia 
have been formulated. 
<H5>  3.2.2. Customs Duties </H5>
  In accordance with the RF Law on Customs Tariffs, as well as 
for the purpose of creating favorable conditions for stimulating 
Russian exporters and partial compensation for the loss of their 
competitiveness as a result of the stabilization of the ruble 
exchange rate, as of 1 November 1993, new rates have been 
introduced for export customs duties and a list of goods to 
which they apply. The Ministry of Finance proposed this back in 
August, but the sectorial lobbies opposed it, all the while 
professing the slogan of the saturation of the domestic market 
due to the ban on exporting goods. 
  In the list of goods subject to the imposition of export 
duties, provision has been made for a reduction in the rates by 
50 percent on average and the number of groups of goods 
subjected to customs duties has been reduced from 53 to 29. At 
the same time, the volume of export quotas has been reduced -- 
quotas have been established only for 12 groups of strategically 
important raw material goods, the exporting of which, as of 
1994, will be carried out by enterprises and organizations 
registered by the MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] 
for this purpose. 
  As of 19 November 1993, new, increased rates were introduced 
for excise taxes on the importing into Russia of certain types 
of alcoholic drinks, cigarettes and passenger cars with engines 
larger than 1800 cubic centimeters. 
  A new list has been drawn up of goods subject to the 
imposition of import duties and of import duty rates, which 
provides for an increase in the level of the rate basically for 
non-necessities, for example, alcoholic drinks, articles made of 
precious metals and stones, carpets, furs and so on. At the same 
time, it is being proposed that import duties be removed almost 
completely from investment-purpose goods and, first of all, from 
modern manufacturing equipment not produced in Russia. 
  In 1993, the danger of excessive protectionism for domestic 
producers intensified. This theme is being actively used by all 
the political forces trying to enhance their popularity among 
the voters. It is alarming that they are trying to include cars, 
household electronics and foodstuffs among the non-necessities. 
With the aid of the customs duties, they are trying to 
camouflage the extreme inefficiency of agriculture and a number 
of sectors of industry, the products of which are ceasing to be 
in demand in the domestic market. 
  They are thereby forcing Russian consumers to purchase 
notoriously lesser quality and more expensive goods, so that, in 
fact, outdated sectors are being subsidized at the expense of 
their pockets, the incentives for increasing efficiency are 
disappearing and industry is being doomed to progressive 
stagnation. This directly contradicts the course of the reforms 
for the liberalization of foreign economic activities and the 
opening up of the domestic market. 
<H5>  3.2.3. International Agreements </H5>
  An important direction of the Ministry of Finance's work is 
the preparation of intergovernmental agreements with other 
countries on avoiding double taxation. As the rightful successor 
of the USSR, Russia took upon itself all the obligations of the 
USSR for similar agreements (21 agreements, including 2 
multilateral agreements with the member countries of CEMA), 
which made it possible to encompass all of Russia's basic 
economic trading partners. 
  At present, in connection with the change in the economic 
and 
political situation and the expiration of the period of validity 
of the previously signed agreements, work is being performed on 
the preparation of new agreements on these matters. After 
ratification by the Russian Supreme Soviet, revised agreements 
with the USA and Poland went into effect as of 1 January 1994. 
Signed agreements with seven countries (Luxembourg, Korea, 
Turkey, Vietnam, Bulgaria, Sweden, and Romania) are awaiting 
ratification in the State Duma. Initialed and ready for signing 
are agreements with another 13 countries, among which are 
Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, Finland, Ukraine, Belarus, 
Israel, Hungary, and the RSA [Republic of South Africa]. The 
negotiating process has been started with nine countries, among 
which are China, France, Germany, Argentina and Uzbekistan: it 
is contemplated that, before the end of 1994, the agreements 
with these countries will also be ready for signing. 
Negotiations will begin in 1994 with a number of countries, in 
particular, with Switzerland, India, Italy and the Baltic States. 
<H5>  3.2.4. Tax Amnesty </H5>
  On 27 October 1993, Presidential Edict No 1773 on the 
Implementation of a Tax Amnesty in 1993 was issued. In 
accordance with this edict, the submission of arrears to the 
budget for taxes was done in November without penalties, while, 
as of 1 December, the amount of the penalties was tripled. 
  Despite the skeptical attitude toward this step, the tax 
amnesty worked: in November, on the whole, across Russia, more 
than 43,000 legal persons and over 2,000 natural persons 
declared their debts to the budget. The total amount of payments 
submitted to the budget came to R270 billion or 5 percent of all 
the receipts in November of 1993. 
<H5>  3.3. Budget Revenues </H5>
  In 1993, the revenues for Russia's budget system amounted to 
around R48 trillion, including R40.4 trillion due to state taxes 
and other obligatory payments. According to the preliminary 
report data, in 1993, the share of budget revenues amounted to 
29.5 percent of the GDP (29.3 percent in 1992), while the share 
of tax receipts decreased from 28.7 percent to 25.1 percent. 
  The share of receipts for the VAT in the GDP decreased by 
4.4 
points, of which 2.6 points were associated with the lowering as 
of 1 January 1993 of the rate for this tax from 28 percent to 20 
percent. The remaining losses were associated, primarily, with 
the underpayment of the VAT because of the enterprises mutual 
non-payments -- around 0.8 percent of the GDP, tax breaks and so 
on. 
  On the other hand, the share of the withdrawal of the 
enterprises' book profits into budgets of all levels increased 
to 49.9 percent as against 46.7 percent in 1992, which entailed 
an increase in the revenues from this tax as a share of the GDP. 
The increase in the taxable profits base basically occurred 
through an increase in the amount of the wage fund above its 
standardized value and a reduction in the share of depreciation 
allowances in the production cost of products.

  The problem of the overall tax burden remains the most 
painful matter of the tax policy. It is being asserted that 
taxes are smothering the producers, that the tax burden is 
unbearable and so on. The listed figures testify to the fact 
that the total tax burden in Russia in 1993 decreased in 
comparison with 1992, although it is somewhat higher in 
comparison with the world's developed countries. 
  The numerous suggestions about lowering taxes in order to 
stimulate the economy are not causing any major objections 
except for one -- how to compensate the budget for the drop in 
revenues. If it is compensated for through a reduction in 
spending, then this can be welcomed, but if it is compensated 
for through emission -- then this is a catastrophe for the 
economy. The experience of the past year showed that a lowering 
of taxes and every possible kind of tax break did not lead to an 
increase in production in a single sector of the national 
economy and if the tax stimulation of investments had an effect, 
then its size does not lend itself to statistical evaluation. 
  A serious problem during the raising of the revenue portion 
of the republic budget in 1993 was the tendency toward a sharp 
decrease in the share of the tax payments being paid into the 
republic budget in the overall amount of the GDP. Thus, whereas 
the share of tax receipts in the GDP in the first quarter of 
1993 amounted to 16.7 percent, it decreased to 12.3 percent in 
the second quarter, to 9 percent in the third quarter and it was 
9.7 percent in the fourth quarter. Of course, it is not entirely 
correct to compare the 1993 results with the data for 1992's 
second half, when inflationary pumping up of the economy 
occurred under the influence of the mutual crediting carried 
out, but the trend itself is obvious. 
  The basic cause of this process was the lowering, beginning 
as of 1 January 1993, of the rate for the value-added tax from 
28 percent to 20 percent, which was not compensated for by an 
increase in other taxes. The effect of this factor began to be 
tracked clearly as of March 1993 and especially as of May, when 
the recalculation of taxes based on the results of the preceding 
year was completed. But, undoubtedly, this factor was not the 
only one and this is confirmed by the decrease in tax receipts, 
which continued up to the end of the year. Only the decrease in 
the inflation rate at year's end influenced a change in this 
tendency (in the short term, the increase in the collection of 
taxes as a share of the GDP, given the decreasing inflation, is 
explained by the technique for remitting the tax payments). In 
our opinion, it is possible to find several more factors which 
have caused such a development of events. 
  It is impossible not to acknowledge the fact that the tax 
collection system is operating poorly. Over the course of the 
year, there was a steady increase in the arrears for payments 
into the budget. According to the State Tax Service's data, 
based on the status on 1 January 1994 as a whole for the 
Republic Budget, they amounted to R1.8 trillion, including R1.0 
trillion for the value-added tax, R500 billion for the profits 
tax and R300 billion for the payments for the use of mineral and 
natural resources. 
  This is especially noticeable in the example of the excise 
taxes: the introduction over the course of 1993 of excise taxes 
for oil and gas did not lead to an increase in actual receipts 
(as a percentage of the GDP or in prices deflated by the rate of 
increase) from this type of taxes in comparison with 1992's 
first quarter, when, in point of fact, the excise taxes had just 
been introduced. Apparently, we should talk about the fact that 
the taxpayers have found very widespread opportunities for tax 
evasion, against which it is necessary to begin to conduct a 
struggle in the very near future. It must be noted that, due to 
the pressure from the sectorial lobby, the excise tax rates for 
oil for five of the largest producers (the share of which 
exceeds 50 percent of the overall amount of oil production in 
the country) were set at the level of 8 percent when the average 
rate is 24 percent. 
  The continuing process of a nominal increase in non-payments 
in the economy is having an adverse impact on the tax receipts. 
Inasmuch as the value-added tax (the cornerstone of the tax 
payments into the federal budget) is being levied on the basis 
of the sale of products and the receipt of money in the 
enterprises' current accounts, the slower settlements in the 
economy proceed, the greater the delays in the collection of 
this tax and the larger the devaluation of the tax receipts. 
According to the data of Rosnalogsluzhba [Russian Tax Service], 
the total of the indebtedness for this tax amounts to around 
R1.3 trillion. 
  It is also impossible to disregard the practice which became 
widespread in the second half of 1993 of granting mass tax 
deferments to large industrial enterprises by the Ministry of 
Finance and local finance organs. According to the Ministry of 
Finance's data, the overall amount of granted deferments just 
for industrial enterprises for the remittance of taxes into the 
federal budget over the period from July through December of 
1993 came to more than R230 billion, of which only R55 billion 
had been paid by year's end. The tax deferments became one of 
the basic methods for financial support of industrial 
enterprises. 
  Serious complications also exist in the collection of all 
types of taxes from a new sector of the economy. Here, a number 
of aspects are intermingled: the imperfect nature of the 
legislation and the availability of tax shelters, the 
organizational weakness and the low level of training of the tax 
workers, the difficulties in recording the activities of many 
entrepreneurs and the progressive development of cash 
settlements in the economy, caused by the low quality of the 
system of bank clearing operations, and simply the striving of 
many entrepreneurs to evade remitting taxes and so on. 
Overcoming these factors will take a long time, but this task is 
one of the priority ones for the state's financial system. 
  The real decrease in the share of tax receipts into the 
republic budget in the GDP was accompanied by the redistribution 
of revenues in favor of the lower levels of the budgets. This 
occurred partially, contrary to the laws, because of the 
decisions of local authorities. Thus, the change for this reason 
in the ratio for dividing receipts from the VAT in favor of the 
regional and local budgets meant a loss for the republic budget 
of approximately R550 billion based on the results for the year 
(see the section "Budget Federalism" [3.6.]). 
  To a large extent, the underpayment of revenues into the 
budget system is associated with the tax evasion which is 
occurring both through concealing the very fact of economic 
activities, through the refusal to register business ventures 
and also through the falsification of the records of commercial 
and production enterprises and banks. 
  As a result of all this, the tendency toward a decrease in 
tax revenues by the end of 1993 seriously concerned the 
government, which decided to increase the tax burden (the 
increase in the VAT rate and the rate for the profits tax and in 
the portion designated for the federal budget). It is true that, 
at the same time, a series of decisions was made which will lead 
to aggravation of the situation involving the collection of 
taxes, inasmuch as they will really have a telling effect on the 
decrease in receipts from the profits tax (which currently, in 
light of a number of reasons, amount to a very large figure in 
comparison with other Eastern European countries). We are 
talking about a revaluation of fixed capital (consequently, the 
depreciation allowances will increase and profits will 
decrease), an increase in the standardized figure for wages from 
four times the minimum wage to six times the minimum wage and an 
increase in the level itself of the minimum wage by a factor of 
1.9. As a consequence, there is no reason to expect an increase 
in tax collections in 1994. 
  The substantial decrease in tax receipts and the limitation 
on the budget deficit were inevitably supplemented by some 
decrease in expenditures and an increase in non-tax receipts. 
The last of the indicated processes became highly significant in 
the second half of 1993, when the ratio of the federal budget's 
overall revenues to the tax revenues (without consideration of 
customs duties) increased from the level of 1.3-1.4 (typical for 
1992 and the beginning of 1993) to 1.7-1.9. Even though, 
according to all the methodological canons, the non-tax revenues 
are budget revenues and not a method for financing, under 
Russian conditions, the budget's non-tax revenues have become an 
inflation-causing factor. The explanation is simple, there were 
two basic methods for obtaining an increase in non-tax revenues: 
the transfer of the Central Bank's profits into the budget and 
the sale of precious metals and stones, again by the Central 
Bank, i.e., in both instances, the increase in budget revenues 
was accompanied by an increase in net internal assets. 
  Around 3.2 percent of the GDP (a little bit less than R5 
trillion) was obtained from the sale of precious metals and 
stones and currency assets of the Central Bank. The use of the 
Central Bank's profits made up approximately 1.3 percent of the 
GDP (R2 trillion). These receipts combined amounted to 4.5 
percent and compensated for the decrease in the share of tax 
receipts in the GDP. 
  But, if the transfer of the Central Bank's profits into the 
budget is a method for the subsequent withdrawal of emission 
income into the budget -- seigniorage (essentially an inflation 
tax) is even better from society's point of view, when this 
profit is spent on state needs rather than on the financing of 
the CIS states and bonuses for Central Bank staff members (as 
was done in 1992), then the sale of precious metals to the 
Central Bank, paid for by the Central Bank through emission, 
contains additional negative aspects. 
  First, the illusion is created that there is no need to 
reorganize the budget funding system, inasmuch as it is possible 
to find the money for funding the state's expenditures. Second, 
it is obvious that the liquid reserves of precious metals (the 
liquidity of which can be confirmed by the world market) are not 
that large and, when reserves of dubious or low liquidity enter 
into the matter, then we should talk about shifting the burden 
of the problems to the banking system. (Although this is a 
separate theme, we consider it necessary to note that the threat 
of a large-scale crisis in the banking system in Russia, as 
before, is extremely high and, in its own consequences, such a 
crisis may be much more serious than the industrial production 
crisis, because internal stabilizers and reserves of any kind 
are lacking in the Russian banking system.) 
  The monitoring work of the tax service and the tax 
investigation department of the observance of the tax 
legislation had an effect on the total volume of tax receipts 
and other payments. During 1993, the total amount of additional 
payments, including penalties based on checks, came to 
approximately R2.6 trillion or 7 percent of the total amount of 
tax receipts (4.7 percent in 1992). 
  Concealing or understating revenues, overstating 
expenditures, which are taken into account during the 
calculation of the taxable base, and incorrectly applying the 
tax rates and breaks remain the basic violations of the tax 
legislation. The instances of direct evasion of the remittance 
of taxes and other obligatory payments and of gross tax 
violations in foreign economic activities have become more 
frequent. For example, after a check of these aspects of the 
activities of Ingosstrakh [Foreign Insurance Main 
Administration], R21.5 billion have been paid into the budget, 
as have R5.5 billion and $400,000 based on the results of a 
check of Sovfrakht [freight administration] and R6 billion from 
Gorknefteorgsintez. 
  It may be stated that the struggle against tax delinquencies 
intensified in 1993, powerful structures are being formed for 
the tax inspectorate (126,000 persons now and 200,000 in the 
future) and the tax investigation department (8,000 persons now 
and 40,000 in the future), they are acquiring experience and 
modern equipment and they are establishing contacts with foreign 
colleagues. In 1994, a sharp increase in operating efficiency is 
possible.

<H5>         3.4. Budget Expenditures </H5>
  The way in which the budget funding of state expenditures in 
1993 occurred showed the entire depth of the crisis in which the 
Russian budget policy and Russia's state finances happen to be. 
The reason for this is obvious: while the economic reforms on 
the whole have been proceeding throughout the country, at least 
without slowing down, for 2 years now, reforms in the budget 
process have not even occurred. To a large extent, the lack of 
changes in 1992 can be explained by the disintegration of the 
USSR and the changes in the staff of the Ministry of Finance, 
the annual cycle of budget planning and the lack of time at the 
end of 1991. 
  However, from the present standpoint, it is evident that 
these are only the external causes. Ultimately, nothing impeded 
the introduction of substantial changes in the budget practice 
as of the middle of 1992 or the beginning of 1993, but this was 
not done. A quite obvious conclusion comes to mind -- the old 
practice of budget planning and the implementation of the budget 
was outdated, while the reformers in the government limited 
themselves to the external indicators of the budget policy's 
successfulness (the level of the budget deficit, first of all). 
  The matter of real budget reform, just the realization of 
which is capable of laying a solid foundation for successes in 
the government's economic policy in the future, is still an even 
more urgent item on the agenda. 
  Most alarming from the standpoint of budget policy is the 
fact that the budget in Russia is being transformed more and 
more from an instrument of economic policy into a tool for 
plugging current holes and for solving short-term political 
problems before a referendum or elections. As a result, there 
are clashes between the planned requirements embedded in the 
annual budget and the stream of daily decisions of the 
government and the president about the necessity of carrying out 
one expenditure or another -- the latter's victory in the 
struggle for the budget ruble is more likely, but less 
efficient. It is obvious that, until this situation is overcome 
or restricted to the limits of the reserve funds, the budget 
will not be able to become a competent instrument of economic 
policy, but rather, it will only be summarized, based on the 
year's results, as the sum of the decisions on expenditures. 
  In 1993, this situation led to the fact that the state, by 
giving priority to the immediate problems, turned out to be in 
no condition to fulfill its planned decisions about raising 
wages and about the funding of investment programs and to pay 
for ordered products and mined precious metals, the bills for 
electricity and the domestic debt liabilities. As a result, the 
state itself, to a certain extent, is initiating the development 
of non-payments and condemning itself to a shortfall in taxes, 
the sum total of the budget expenditures is only a cash result 
and the amount of budget indebtedness remains unknown. 
  Of course, 1993's indebtedness can be carried over into 
1994, 
but it is obvious that, without changes in the attitude toward 
the budget, this situation will be reproduced annually on an 
ever-increasing scale. 
  The next problem is the problem of the promises and the 
excessiveness of the planned expenditures. Even in the budget 
planning stage, spending amounts are embedded in it which 
deliberately exceed the state's capabilities. For every ruble of 
the expenditures recorded in the budget, there is interest on 
the part of one department or another or one group of people or 
another. As a result, the funds are being allocated not to those 
who need them or for whom they would be most effective from the 
viewpoint of public interests, but rather, to those who are 
capable of securing the support of highly placed persons and 
exerting pressure on the Ministry of Finance when need be. As a 
result, the total amount of the republic budget's expenditures 
came to 75 percent of the planned budget, so that, during the 
compiling of the budget, the government, at the urging of the 
Ministry of Finance, in the course of refining the budget, twice 
sequestered all spending items (by 15 percent in the summer of 
1993 and by 20 percent during the determination of expenditures 
for the fourth quarter of 1993). Only this made it possible to 
prevent the uncontrolled growth of the budget deficit. 
  The total amount of the expenditures of the RF consolidated 
budget came to around R61 trillion and amounted with respect to 
the GDP in 1993 to 37.8 percent as against 33 percent of the GDP 
in 1992. This is associated with the increase in social spending 
and the inclusion in the budget of expenditures for a number of 
quasi-budget operations such as the credits for Roskhleboprodukt 
[Russian cereal products] for purchasing grain, conversion and 
investment credits and credits to the CIS states. In a 
comparable structure, the level of budget spending with respect 
to the GDP in 1993 decreased in comparison with 1992 by 1.6 
percent of the GDP. The structure of the consolidated budget's 
expenditures in comparison with 1992 is shown in Table 3.

  The republic budget's expenditures in 1993 amounted to 
R34.079 trillion. Implemented completely was the funding for 
socially protecting spending items to the extent of incoming 
revenues and the involvement of Central Bank credits. This 
determined the scale of the underfunding of the spending items 
as against the budget plan adopted in the RF law of 14 May 1993. 
The total amount of the underfunding came to R13.8 trillion. In 
capital construction, the state's overdue accounts payable 
amounted on 1 January 1994 to around R1.5 trillion; the 
indebtedness for the payment of deliveries of arms, military 
equipment, foodstuff, fuel and stores, for state defense order 
projects and installations and for other expenditures, which, 
proceeding on the basis of the actual prices and tariffs in 
effect in accordance with signed agreements, amounted to around 
R2.7 trillion; the indebtedness for transfers to the regional 
budgets was around R440 billion. The most urgent unfunded 
expenditures will be paid off during the implementation of the 
budget for the first quarter of 1994. 
<H5>  3.5. The Priority Directions of the Budget Expenditures </H5>
<H5>  3.5.1. The National Economy </H5>
  A substantial decrease in actual expenditures for the 
"national economy" (as a share of the GDP) occurred: from 6 
percent in 1992 they fell to 2.7 percent in 1993. In and of 
itself, this process is an indicator of the qualitative change 
in the RF budget, inasmuch as, instead of talking about "the 
necessity of separating the finances of the state and the 
enterprises," the state actually started to do this and is 
reducing its own meddling in the economy through the budget. At 
the same time (and this was mentioned above), quasi-budget 
methods are being developed for the financial support of 
enterprises through the granting of deferments for tax payments, 
the allocation of budget loans and individual tax breaks 
(basically, for foreign economic activities, although there are 
precedents for domestic taxes as well). 
  In this way, over the course of 1993, AO Rosselmash [Russian 
agricultural machinery] received around R100 billion (so that, 
of the R22 billion in profits derived over 9 months of 1993, 
this enterprise directed only R0.4 billion toward the 
replenishment of its working capital, while it remitted R1.6 
billion out of its profits for exceeding the standardized wage 
level), the Norilsk Nickel concern received around R70 billion, 
AO Kondpetroleum [Condpetroleum] -- more than R50 billion and 
AZLK [Motor Vehicle Plant imeni Leninist Komsomol] -- more than 
R30 billion.

  One more method for the financial support of enterprises of 
the national economy was centralized importing, i.e., purchasing 
goods abroad for the enterprises' needs using the state's 
resources (basically through foreign loans). The enterprises 
partially paid for the imported goods by using the so-called 
subsidy factors. The amounts of these subsidies for 1992 and 
1993 are shown below.

<H5>  3.5.2. Financial Support of the Agro-Industrial Complex </H5>
  Proceeding on the basis of the necessity of state support of 
the Agro-Industrial Complex during the period of the transition 
to market relations and its priority in the Russian Government's 
economic policy, R3.422 trillion rubles were provided for this 
purpose in the past year in the republic budget and they were 
distributed according to the following basic directions: 
  -- R1.260 trillion for the funding of federal capital 
construction programs; 
  -- R1.234 trillion to compensate for the difference in 
interest rates for preferential credits for agricultural 
commodity producers; 
  -- R444 billion for subsidies to cover part of the 
expenditures for the production of agricultural products, 
including subsidies for breeding and selected seed growing, 
compensation of part of the cost of fertilizers, energy 
resources and insurance payments and other subsidies; 
  -- and R372 billion for operating expenses for the 
maintenance of budget-controlled institutions and the 
implementation of measures in the Agro-Industrial Complex. 
  The strained situation involving the budget revenues was 
also 
reflected in the funding of the planned expenditures for the 
Agro-Industrial Complex: R2.198 trillion were allocated for all 
directions or 64 percent of the planned amount. The agricultural 
commodity producers were fully compensated through budget funds 
for the difference in the interest rates for preferential 
credits and the operating expenses of the ministries and 
departments were funded by 85 percent. 
  The situation involving investments and subsidies is worse. 
The lowest fulfillment occurs in the policy for state capital 
investments -- agriculture was allocated for this purpose 34.5 
percent of the planned amounts. Funding at the level of 35 
percent was provided for the subsidies to agricultural 
producers, including for such directions as breeding, selected 
seed growing and insurance. However, under the conditions of the 
strict limitation on financial resources, the budget funds were 
spent on extremely inefficient types of subsidies -- the 
acquisition of fertilizer and agricultural equipment, i.e., it 
was not agriculture which was supported, but rather, inefficient 
industrial production. 
  Substantial support is being given to the Agro-Industrial 
Complex using tax methods as well: all the agricultural 
producers have been exempted from paying the tax on profits 
derived from the production of agricultural products and, as of 
1 January 1994, from their processing. The total amount of the 
tax breaks for agriculture are estimated to be R500 billion 
based on 1993's results. However, a number of the breaks granted 
turned out to be extremely ineffective and they are being used 
for tax evasion. Thus, the farms have been exempted from payment 
of the VAT when selling their own products and acquiring 
agricultural equipment and instances have already been recorded 
when the agricultural equipment purchased by the farms simply 
cannot be housed on their plots of land. 
  One of the most important directions in the Ministry of 
Finance's work was the extension of credit for 1993 grain 
harvest purchases, for which FKK Roskhleboprodukt [farm sales 
concern Russian cereal products] was allocated R1.566 trillion 
in budget loans at 10 percent annual interest. In addition, R455 
billion in centralized credit resources were directed toward 
covering expenses associated with the purchasing of grain and 
oilseeds. 
  At the same time, the agrarian lobby asserted that the 
allocated funds were insufficient and that the state owed large 
sums (around R600 billion) to the commodity producers. As is 
well known, the problem of the payments for grain arose because 
the state, first of all, promised to purchase an enormous 
quantity of grain, while funding was included in the federal 
budget for purchases not only of grain for federal needs, but 
also for the regions' needs; and second, the state was obligated 
to pay a price for the grain which was approximately 40 percent 
higher than the exchange's price and to index these prices 
monthly by 10 percent. All these decisions were made without 
consideration of the state's financial capabilities and adopted 
despite the Ministry of Finance's position. 
  In addition, and this is an overall problem of the budget, 
the allocated funds were partially used for purposes other than 
the intended ones. The state allocated funds to pay for the 
purchased grain, while Roskhleboprodukt was financing its own 
current expenditures through budget loans. It is obvious that 
the existing state grain-purchasing system needs substantial 
changes and some of them were implemented at the end of 1993. 
  Thus, as of November, the state abandoned the indexing of 
prices for purchased grain, which is now being acquired at lower 
free prices and a decision was made about the repeated use of 
issued budget loans to complete the payments for the grain from 
1993's harvest and for payments for grain purchased for the 
federal reserves in 1994. 
  In 1994, RF entities will independently provide for their 
own 
needs for grain and the products from its processing, forming 
regional reserves proceeding on the basis of the needs and the 
possibilities for funding grain purchases using the funds of the 
corresponding budgets. 
  Over the course of the year, R3.181 trillion in centralized 
credit resources, including R1.650 trillion in preferential 
credits, were allocated for conducting spring planting and 
harvesting operations, for purchasing and warehousing potatoes 
and vegetables for winter storage, for acquiring fodder, and for 
purchasing sugar beet, wool, flax and hemp to the agricultural 
commodity producers and enterprises and organizations of 
Roskompishcheprom [RF Committee on the Food and Processing 
Industry] and the fishing industry. 
  In the second half of 1993, after the refinancing rate for 
Central Bank credits had increased substantially, it became 
clear that granting preferential credits is not only extremely 
inefficient, but also a highly expensive system for rendering 
financial support. As is well known, preferential credits to 
enterprises were granted at an annual interest rate of 28 
percent, while the budget financed the difference between the 
Central Bank's rate and this level. As soon as, during the 
summer, the Central Bank's refinancing rate exceeded 128 
percent, the budget expenditures to cover the difference in the 
percentage rates became larger than the amount of credit. Giving 
direct financial aid from the budget is turning out to be 
cheaper and this was one of the main reasons for the 
government's refusal to grant preferential credits (25 September 
1993). 
  The financial support of the Agro-Industrial Complex in 
Russia, apparently, will still be maintained still for a quite 
long time to come, but, in order for it to have a real effect, 
the government should abandon the policy of allocating the 
largest possible amount of financial resources and should focus 
attention, rather, on determining those specific programs, the 
funding of which actually helps the agricultural producers and 
produces a return in the interests of society. 
<H5>  3.5.3. Investments </H5>
  In 1993, the state continued to be the largest investor in 
the economy, while the investments were aimed at both the 
production and the nonproduction spheres. 
  The funding of state centralized capital investments, as an 
unprotected item of the federal budget, was carried out in 1993 
based on the extent of revenues received, as a result of which, 
with annual allocations in the amount of R3,890.3 billion, 
R2,235.9 billion were actually funded, or 57 percent of the 
plan. In comparison with 1992, when, with planned allocations of 
R346.6 billion, the actual funding came to R303.3 billion, or 
87.5 percent -- the situation has deteriorated. 
  Under the conditions of the extreme limitedness of budget 
funds, state preferential credit for investment needs, allocated 
in the amount of R400 billion and transferred completely to the 
borrowers, became one of the basic methods for state support of 
federal programs and projects of statewide importance in 1993. 
In 1992, the amount of state preferential credits extended came 
to R105 billion. 
  At the same time, it must be noted that the funds for 
investment credits and direct budget investments in the 
production sphere were scattered among a large number of 
projects and were often aimed at the realization of projects 
with long construction time frames. As a result, according to 
the State Committee for Statistics' data, of the 149 projects, 
the construction of which was begun in 1993 using budget 
allocations, only 10 have been placed into service, while, of 
the 504 projects, toward the construction of which investment 
credit funds have been directed, only 18 have been placed into 
service. 
  In 1993, within the framework of the government-approved 
State Program for Conversion of the Defense Industry for the 
Years 1993- 1995, funding of programs for the reconfiguration of 
defense orders toward the production of civilian products 
continued. Monetary assets on a repayment basis in the amount 
of R300 billion have been allocated for this purpose from the 
republic budget. In connection with the limitedness of the 
indicated credit resources, funding has been implemented for 
only 734 conversion programs, including 459 totally completed in 
1993. 
  Production capacities for the production of new civil 
aviation equipment, equipment for the oil and gas production 
industry and the processing industries of the Agro-Industrial 
Complex, many types of complicated household equipment, medical 
equipment, and environmental protection products, have been 
brought on line through the conversion credits to the defense 
complex enterprises. According to the enterprises' calculations, 
the expected increase in capacities as a whole for all the 
convertible enterprises will come to R1.560 trillion worth of 
civilian products per year. 
  An important task in 1993 was providing the conditions for 
the development of the "Housing" Program. As a result of the 
realization of the first stages of the "Housing" Program, the 
slump in housing construction, which had been going on for 4 
years, was successfully stopped. According to the preliminary 
data, residential houses with an overall space of 42 million 
square meters have been started, which amounts to 101 percent as 
against 1992's starts. 
  Over the course of the past year, the structure of housing 
construction with respect to financing sources was successfully 
changed substantially, sharply increasing the share of 
non-budget financing of housing construction. In accordance with 
the program, federal budget funds were directed toward the 
construction of housing for military personnel. At the same 
time, there was a significant decrease in housing starts using 
the assets of state enterprises and organizations, while the 
construction of housing by individuals building for themselves 
on their own increased by 10 percent, by joint-stock companies 
by more than 15 percent and by economic partnerships by nearly 
35 percent. 
<H5>  3.5.4. Financing the "Northern" Shipment </H5>
  On orders of the Governmental Commission on Credit Policy, 
preferential credits in the amount of around R2 trillion were 
allocated for the financing of early shipments in 1993 and 
compensatory payments were made in the amount of around R200 
billion. The favorable terms for issuing these credits and the 
poor return make this type of credits almost a form of gratis 
budget financing. 
  The necessity of these expenditures is motivated by the 
remoteness of the Far North's regions, the harsh climatic 
conditions, the limited navigation periods and the industrial 
specialization. However, this justification does not stand up to 
criticism. The relatively high level of expenditures for the 
establishment of reserves means that the prices for the shipped 
goods should be higher than in the country's central oblasts. In 
point of fact, the consumer prices in these regions are 
appreciably higher, despite the preferential nature of the 
credits extended for the shipments. 
  This fact and the numerous abuses involving the preferential 
special-purpose credits are proof that this mechanism for 
financing the shipments is extremely inefficient and it needs to 
be changed. In connection with this, it is advisable in the 
first stage to budget delivery assistance and, in the second 
stage, to transfer the financial resources to the local 
administrations on a non-repayment basis. Under conditions when 
the interest rates for deposits in commercial banks are 
favorable, there is a possibility for maintaining the actual 
value of working capital initially transferred from the republic 
budget. 
<H5>  3.5.5. Reinforcing the Social Orientation of the Expenditures </H5>
  In 1993, a real increase occurred in the social significance 
of the budget expenditures. Spending for social and cultural 
measures increased in real terms from 7.1 percent of the GDP in 
1992 to 7.5 percent. The level of the actual expenditures for 
social and cultural measures increased by 6 percent in 
comparison with 1992, while the actual expenditures for the 
needs of education and health care increased by a factor of 1.3. 
The actual funding of science increased by a fourth. 
  Over the course of 1993, the indexing of pensions was 
carried 
out three times, the amounts of social allowances and 
compensatory payments for children were increased repeatedly, 
compensation for feeding children and for purchasing clothes for 
children was started, the decision was made to introduce in 1994 
a single allowance for each child, regardless of the family's 
average per capita income, payments of an allowance for bread 
have been made to low-income categories of citizens, and state 
financial support was given to public organizations for the 
handicapped. A decison was made about additional material 
support for citizens for special services to Russia. Support was 
implemented for young students receiving scholarships and free 
rooms in dormitories, nutritional subsidies are being made, 
travel benefits are being granted and health-improvement 
measures are being carried out. 
  State financial aid is being given to television and radio 
broadcasting, the periodical press and cultural institutions. At 
the same time, 26 especially valuable sites of the cultural 
heritage of the peoples of Russia are being funded from the RF 
federal budget. Among them are the GABT [State Academic Bolshoy 
Theater] of Russia, the State Kremlin Palace, the MGU [Moscow 
State University], the State Scientific Library, the State 
Russian Museum, the State Hermitage, and the State Tretyakov 
Gallery. 
  In 1993, the Russian Government adopted a series of measures 
for the support of science, state scientific grants have been 
established for Russia's prominent scientists and for talented 
young scientists, provisions have been made for monthly 
supplementary payments for the academic degrees of doctor of 
science and candidate of science, as well as for members of the 
RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] for the academic titles of 
academician and corresponding member. 
  Under the conditions of the harsh inflation and the shortage 
of funds, the resources for the normal functioning of social, 
cultural and scientific institutions must be found also through 
more efficient use within the sectors themselves. 
  Over the course of the last few years, measures have not 
been 
carried out for the structural reorganization of these sectors, 
as a result of which the available network is being used 
inefficiently and the proof of this is in the low workload of 
the children's preschool and medical institutions and the 
decrease in the fullness of the classes in general education 
schools and in the groups of kindergartens and nurseries and the 
like. 
  It is impossible to consider as rational the use of budget 
allocations over the course of recent years by higher 
educational institutions in which, given the decrease in the 
student body, an increase is taking place in the size of the 
professorial and teaching staff. At the same time, the 
calculated number of students assigned to a single teacher 
amounts to an insignificant figure. 
  It is impossible to consider as rational a system for the 
social protection of the population, which is oriented toward 
the widest possible circle of recipients, when the recipients of 
budget subsidies are both the truly needy and also people with 
ultrahigh incomes. 
  In view of the insufficiency of financial assets, the state 
can no longer maintain the number of scientific organizations 
which were inherited from past years. In order to ward off the 
currently occurring spontaneous decrease in the scientific 
research sphere, it is advisible that, in 1994, budget 
allocations be aimed basically at the development of the 
priority directions of basic and exploratory research. The 
funding of developments of an applied nature should be carried 
out using budget funds for the funding of NIOKR [research and 
development], bank credits, and advance funding on the part of 
enterprises which are consumers of scientific products and other 
non-budget sources. 
<H5>  3.6. Budget Federalism </H5>
  The federal budget's mutual relations with the budgets of 
the 
regions (budget federalism) were one of the must acute problems 
of 1993. Everyone remembers the crisis of August and September, 
when more than 30 regions made the decision not to transfer tax 
receipts to the federal budget. This behavior had been partly 
provoked by the lack of funds in the republic's Ministry of 
Finance for fulfilling the obligations for financial support of 
the regions, which were contained in 1993's planned budget. 
  In 1993, the old system of the mutual relations of budgets, 
based on the coordination of all the figures for the revenues 
and expenditures of the regional budgets in Moscow, was 
retained. Undoubtedly, in these coordinations, some of the 
regions gained relatively more, some relatively less, but 
everyone won, and the only loser was the federal budget, for 
which the burden of the financial support of the regions 
increased. The losing regions, in trying to recoup their losses, 
"perforated" for themselves the government's decrees or the 
president's edicts with obligatory financial injections 
(frequently, the entire text of a document consisted of the 
items "The Ministry of Finance shall provide..."). As a result 
the losers gained, while the winners lost and everything was 
repeated again. Based on 1993's results, there were almost no 
regions, for the support of which a separate document had not 
been adopted. 
  If all the methods of financial support from the federal 
budget are considered (subsidies, subventions, clearing accounts 
and the individual standards for deductions from the VAT into 
the regional budgets), then, in the 1993 budget, 72 regions 
should have received financial aid from the Center, but, in 
point of fact, however, there was not a single region which 
would not receive this aid in one form or another. 
  Over the course of 1993, never settled were the budget 
mutual 
relations with Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Yakutia and Chechnya. 
In the second half of the year, temporary agreements were 
reached with the first three listed republics as part of the RF 
about their participation in partially covering the federal 
budget's expenditures. However, their validity expired as of the 
end of 1993 and the problem of the interbudget mutual relations 
with the indicated federation entities is again becoming one of 
the "hottest." 
  The situation in the area of budget federalism, to a large 
extent, is unique. The existence of 89 federation entities 
determines the complexity of a structure which is supposed to 
satisfy everyone, but if all the differences of a historical, 
geographical, climatic and ethnic nature and so on are added to 
this, then the task is exceptionally complicated. 
  In 1994, Russia is entering the period of implementing the 
most serious reform of the budget mutual relations between the 
federal and regional levels of power on the basis of the 
division of responsibility for solving the economic and social 
problems of the development of the country and the regions by 
means of the corresponding distribution of state expenditures 
and revenues. 
  Presidential Edict No 2268 of 22 December 1993 on the 
Formation of the Russian Federation's Republic Budget and the 
Mutual Relations with the Budgets of the Russian Federation's 
Entities laid the foundation for a new system and provides for 
its construction on the following principles: 
  -- the consistent differentiation of the responsibility of 
the republic, regional and local authorities in conformity with 
the federative organization of the state and the differentiation 
on this basis of the expenditures of the different levels' 
budgets so that the regional and local organs of power would 
have sufficiently broad independence in the economic policy. The 
division of the expenditures should be implemented in such a 
manner as to bring them as close as possible to the 
administrative unit, in the interests of which these 
expenditures are being carried out and to avoid thereby their 
unnecessary centralization; 
  -- the centralization of revenues at the republic level 
should be implemented exclusively for the purpose of the 
realization of statewide economic and social programs, to ensure 
the stability of state finances and the monetary system, as well 
as the redistribution of financial resources for the purpose of 
equalizing the development of the regions. The preservation and 
strengthening of a unified state is possible only on the basis 
of the independence of the federal and territorial budgets and 
the equal participation of all the territories in the funding of 
the federal government's expenditures through the application of 
common principles for raising the republic budget's revenues. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-004L-35A>      Figure 12. The Share of Local Budgets in the Revenues and Expenditures of the Consolidated </FIG>


  Various schemes will be used during the division of the 
revenue receipts between the levels of the budgets: the transfer 
to the regional budgets of a portion of the federal tax receipts 
(with respect to the VAT), the addition of rates (the profits 
tax) and the division of the sources of revenue receipts. The 
regional and local organs of power have been granted the right 
to impose on their own additional regional and local taxes for 
replenishing the revenue portion of their own budgets. 
  Special attention during the formation of the budget for 
1994 
is being paid to solving the problem of the asymmetry of the 
territories' financial supply -- for various reasons, the 
majority of the territories lack revenue sources of their own 
for the funding of expenditures even at a level which ensures 
the satisfaction of the minimum social needs. In all countries, 
this problem is being solved by means of the redistribution of a 
portion of the financial resources through a central budget 
which favors territories which are experiencing a shortage of 
funds. In Russia, it was and is being solved in a similar 
fashion, but, without a common approach in the mutual relations 
between the center and the regions in matters of the 
redistribution of budget funds, some regions are receiving 
investments, tax breaks and enhanced standards for the formation 
of the budget's revenue base: others are not receiving any of 
these things and, what is more, they have been forced to bear 
the additional burden of collecting the financial resources. 
  Understanding the necessity of establishing a clear system 
for the redistribution of resources within the budget system, it 
is being proposed that the following mechanism be used. A 
special budget fund is established for the regions' financial 
support (in order to increase the subsidized regions' revenue 
base), into which will be entered 22 percent of the VAT receipts 
(from the portion subject to entry into the republic budget). 
Distribution of this fund's assets will be carried out 
automatically to the extent of the funds received by it in 
proportions approved by the government simultaneously with the 
approval of the republic budget. During the determination of the 
proportions for the distribution of this fund's assets among the 
regions, it is assumed that a number of factors will be 
considered (the actual transfers in 1993, the regions' tax 
potential and the correlation of the regional budget's 
expenditures, allocated on a per capita basis, with the average 
for this economic region). 
  In addition, the Russian Government will continue solving 
the 
problem of the equalization of the various regions' economic 
development levels, which will be solved through the realization 
of the federal special-purpose programs. 
  At the same time, the government intends to abandon making 
decisions about granting various credits (first and foremost, 
for remitting customs duties) to the regions. 
  These steps will make it possible to systematize 
organizationally and quantitatively the rendering of financial 
support to the regions, but, at the same time, they will require 
the strengthening of control over the budget planning and 
verification of the validity of the budget expenditures of the 
territories appealing for assistance. 
<H5>  3.7. Funding the Deficit of Government Expenditures </H5>
  The evaluation of this indicator in conformity with 
international practice is of essential importance, inasmuch as 
it makes it possible to establish the real extent of the 
government's financial deficit. According to the IMF's 
methodology, the overall amount of the expanded government 
deficit is determined as the sum: 
  (1) of the net credit to the government from the banking 
system, which includes the Central Bank and the commercial 
banks, as well as the Ministry of Finance's use of its own net 
international reserves for the funding of government 
expenditures;

  At the time of the report's preparation, comprehensive 
information on 1993's results was lacking and this is why 
estimates have been used for a number of items. First and 
foremost, this pertains to the amount of unpaid foreign debt 
obligations and the net credit from the rest of the banking 
system. The preliminary estimates indicate that the expanded 
government deficit in 1993 amounted to 9.2 percent of the GDP, 
including 5.5 percent due to domestic funding and 3.7 percent to 
foreign funding. The same indicator for 1992, calculated 
according to the IMF's methodology, amounted to 36.5 percent of 
the GDP, i.e., in 1993, the deficit had been reduced almost by a 
factor of 4. 
  But this result in and of itself, although it is undoubtedly 
important, cannot serve as the sole indicator to which attention 
must be paid during the analysis of the results of the budget's 
execution in 1993. The funding sources for the government's 
expanded deficit in 1993 are shown in Table 7. 
  It is impossible not to note the qualitative shift which 
occurred in 1993 in the methods for funding it. Of course, the 
basic methods for funding the deficit, as before, were the 
Central Bank's credits and foreign credits, the share of which 
came to 75 percent of the overall amount of the budget deficit. 
<H5>  3.8. Servicing the Domestic Debt </H5>
  In 1993, for the first time in the post-revolutionary 
period, 
the entire state domestic debt of the former USSR, accepted by 
Russia, was legalized. Simultaneously with the budget for 1993, 
calculations of the amount of the state debt and a projection of 
its upper limit were submitted to the Supreme Soviet. On the 
whole, based on 1993's results, the total domestic state debt 
amounted to R35.3 trillion, which is equivalent to approximately 
22 percent of the GDP (see Table 8).

State Domestic Debt as a      21.8 
Percentage of the GDP 


  In 1993, the structure of the state debt was changed. The 
share of the indebtedness to the Central Bank for credits to 
enterprises under a government guarantee decreased from 47.9 
percent to 12.9 percent. The share of Central Bank credits to 
the government to cover the budget deficit increased from 
one-third to 83.6 percent. The share of the indebtedness to the 
Savings Bank decreased from 8.1 percent to 0.9 percent (in 
connection with the repayment of part of the indebtedness and 
the increase in the total state debt). 
  The paramount strategic goal -- the transition to 
non-inflationary funding of the budget deficit -- was not 
attained in 1993. In all, 2-3 percent of the total federal 
budget deficit (R330 billion) was covered through the sale of 
state securities. However, the most important result is the 
establishment, jointly with the Central Bank within a very short 
time frame, of a stable infrastructure for the state securities 
market, providing them with high liquidity and the gradual 
restoration of confidence in the state as a borrower. 
  The most complicated problem in the debt servicing plan in 
1993 was the problems of the former USSR's debts to the public. 
The conversion of the USSR 1982 loan into RSFSR 1992 loans and 
the redemption of USSR treasury bonds in the hands of the people 
made it possible to reduce and to legalize the indebtedness to 
the public for securities. Currently, the people are holding 
bonds for the 1982 loan in the amount of R15 billion, since the 
yield for them has been raised twice and amounted at the 
beginning of 1994 to 45 percent. 
  In the amount of the entire state debt, the share of the 
commodity debts to the public continued to increase because of 
the increase in prices for consumer goods. The indebtedness to 
the holders of special-purpose checks which gave them the right 
to acquire motor vehicles in 1991 has been paid off and 120,000 
holders of these documents received full compensation. The 
indebtedness for Urozhay-90 [Harvest-90] checks has been 
partially paid off by the lessors of 1991's agricultural 
products. Something on the order of R160 billion was spent for 
these purposes in 1993. At the same time, drafts of the 
appropriate documents which provide for the complete repayment 
in 1994 of the state's remaining indebtedness for commodity 
obligations have been submitted to the government. 
<H8>  The Basic Tasks for 1994 </H8>
  1. Budget reform has become the most important necessity for 
the state. Budget reform should be all-encompassing and include 
inherently a new budget classification, a new system of budget 
federalism, a change in the principles of budget planning and a 
change in the structure of the Ministry of Finance and the 
financial system. It is understandable that the execution of a 
budget cannot stop for even a single day and this is why the 
reforms must be implemented "on the run," and thus they will be 
difficult and painful. But, unless the system for budget 
planning and the budget's execution are brought into line with 
the new realities, the budget will remain the "Achilles heel" of 
the economic policy in Russia. 
  2. The greatest attention should be paid to strengthening 
the 
budget's revenue base. This can be achieved by improving the tax 
legislation, strengthening the tax service and abandoning the 
policy of granting individual breaks to enterprises, no matter 
how large and important they are. 
  3. A key task is the banning of a budget deficit increase 
funded through emission sources above 1993's level. On the one 
hand, a drop in production leads to a drop in the actual level 
of tax receipts just as the budget-funding requirements are 
being regularly indexed based on the inflation rate. On the 
other hand, undoubtedly, the sources of non-tax receipts (of 
which the state made good use in 1993's second half) will 
gradually dry up (the gold reserves will dwindle and the Central 
Bank's profit will decrease as the refinancing rate decreases) 
and, given a lack of real changes in the budget policy, the 
state will not be able to resist the pressure for an increase in 
budget expenditures and the deficit's level. 
  4. During the planning of budget revenues and expenditures, 
it is necessary to proceed on the basis of realistic rather than 
"politicized" estimates of the dynamics of the GDP and the main 
budget-forming indicators. It is better to underestimate the 
amount of possible revenue receipts going into the budget, than 
to overestimate them and to run into an acute shortage of 
financial resources. 
  5. In 1994, it is necessary to complete the process of 
including in the budget the quasi-fiscal operations which had 
previously been funded through Central Bank centralized credits 
-- agriculture's seasonal needs, the shipping of consumer goods 
and fuel to the regions of the Far North and territories 
comparable to them and the like. At the same time, the tolerable 
amount of a deficit within the limits of 6-7 percent of the GDP 
should be a legislative limitation for any plans for increasing 
the budget's spending section. 
  6. It is advisable that the federal budget be strengthened 
with the inclusion in its spending section of obligatory 
reserves for the basic spending directions. These directions can 
be used by order of the government only in the event that the 
inflation indicators in the first and second quarters will 
exceed the forecasts which have served as the basis for the 
spending plan. In this way, the constant revising of all the 
budget's indicators, which disorganizes its execution, should be 
stopped. 
  7. It is necessary to repudiate a whole series of statutes 
of 
previously adopted legislative acts and government decrees, 
which are absolutely unfounded from a financial viewpoint. 
Examples of these kinds of decisions are the law on social 
guarantees for inhabitants of the North, the Law on Grain, the 
Law on Social Guarantees for Military Personnel, the 
government's decree on compensation for transport costs during 
"shipping to the North" and many others. The execution of these 
decisions fully would result in the country's financial collapse 
within the shortest of time frames. 
  8. It is necessary to develop sequentially the state 
securities market, switching to lengthier time frames for their 
repayment so that the funds accumulated in this manner would 
cover a substantial share of the federal budget's deficit. 
<H5>  4. Monetary Policy </H5>
  In appraising Russia's monetary policy in 1993 as moderately 
harsh, it must be emphasized that its realization was carried 
out while there was constant opposition to the course pursued by 
the government. It is important that, even under the conditions 
of the primitive forms and methods of this policy and the lack 
of the necessary instruments, the Ministry of Finance managed to 
force the Central Bank to change its activities to a great 
extent. 
  The conflicts which arose during this time and which, in a 
number of instances, grew into open confrontation between the 
two departments, undoubtedly complicated the financial 
stabilization process. Meanwhile, it is obvious that, without 
pressure on the Central Bank, it would not have been possible to 
achieve the appreciable positive results in this area. 
  The basic instruments of the anti-inflationary monetary 
policy were: 
  1. Limiting the absolute amounts of centralized credits 
granted by the Central Bank to the government to cover the 
budget deficit and to the economy. 
  2. Standardizing and gradually raising the Central Bank's 
official interest rate for centralized credits to the economy. 
  3. Stabilizing the ruble's exchange rate by means of Central 
Bank interventions in the buying and selling of currency in the 
currency market. 
  Of the named instruments, it is likely that the most 
effective one was the limiting of the quarterly absolute 
increases in centralized credit indebtedness, the volume of 
which, as before, is the chief factor in the increase of the 
total money supply. The doubling of the interest rate for the 
Central Bank's centralized credit to the economy exerted 
noticeable influence on the formation of the credit market. At 
the same time, of disproportionately great importance was the 
Central Bank's buying and selling of currency in the currency 
market, as a result of which there was an additional "infusion" 
into the economy of approximately R2.5 trillion worth of credit 
emissions (see the section on the currency policy [5.1.]). 
<H5>  4.1. Centralized Credits </H5>
  In 1993, there was a consecutive limiting of the amounts 
of the centralized extenditure of credit -- of Central Bank 
credits to the government and the economy. Given the relative 
decrease in the share of these credits with respect to the GDP 
from 35 percent in 1992 to 12.8 percent in 1993, the proportion 
of centralized credits in the total amount of credit extended 
decreased insignificantly: from 88.2 percent to 85 percent, 
which testifies to the weakness of the banking system and the 
inadequate development of the loan market. The extremely high 
proportion of centralized credits is one of the main 
shortcomings of the credit policy. 
  The limiting of the absolute amounts of the increase in 
centralized credit indebtedness is the result of the work of the 
Governmental Commission on Credit Policy, which, guided by the 
joint declaration of the government and the Central Bank of 22 
May 1993, began, as of the second quarter, to establish 
quarterly limits for centralized credit extension with a 
breakdown by sectors and individual enterprises. 
  The largest targets of the centralized credits, just as in 
previous years, were: the Agro-Industrial Complex and the Fuel 
and Energy Complex, as well as the shipments to the Far North. 
The key thing which differed from the established practice was 
the fact that, in 1993, the imposed harsh limiters on the 
increase in centralized credit indebtedness were maintained 
consistently (with the exception of the third quarter), which, 
with all the costs, provided the minimally necessary control 
over the increase in the amounts of credit extended and the 
inflation rate. 
  The most important event in the realization of the goals of 
the monetary policy in 1993 was the adoption by the government 
on 25 September 1993 of the decision on the abolition of 
subsidized credits, by which it was established that, 
henceforth, all centralized credits to sectors of the national 
economy and individual enterprises should be granted at a common 
interest rate by the Central Bank. Along with the gradual 
raising of the overall level of the rates (to a favorable level 
by year's end), this decision made it possible to reduce the 
unfounded demand for centralized credits. 
  At the same time, an unresolved problem is ensuring the 
repayment of centralized credits to the economy, which were 
granted for a term of up to 1 year, which is undoubtedly 
inadequate for sectors and enterprises with a lengthy production 
cycle or production of a seasonal nature. The constant 
extensions, in point of fact, are converting these credits into 
subsidized financing and hidden subsidies. The Central Bank is 
carrying out the issuing of centralized credits to the end 
recipients through commercial banks, which by far are not always 
interested in and capable of ensuring their timely repayment.

  In addition, granting credit to financially unstable sectors 
of the economy places them in an even more difficult position, 
inasmuch as they are known to be unable to pay even the lower 
but still quite high interest for the received resources, not to 
mention the repayment of the debt's basic amount. The increase 
in such credits is also leading to a deterioration of the 
quality of the banking system, in which the share of potentially 
irrecoverable credits is increasing. The adoption by the 
government on 18 November 1993 of the decision on deferring the 
repayment of credits from agriculture, for all practical 
purposes, signifies the first step on the path to the future 
write-off of the indebtedness, as happened repeatedly during the 
time of the old system. 
  In the second quarter, the established limits for 
centralized 
credit extension were realized. The breakdown occurred in the 
third quarter, when, to by-pass the Commission on Credit Policy, 
the Central Bank issued credits to the Agro-Industrial Complex 
and for the shipments to the Far North's regions above the 
established limits, alluding to separate decisions of the 
government and the former RF Supreme Soviet. Then the same 
commission made errors in the estimation of the seasonal demand 
for credits for shipping goods to the Far North's regions, which 
immediately had a telling effect on the rate of inflation, which 
reached a record level by the end of the third quarter. 
  The extraordinary measures undertaken by the Ministry of 
Finance in the fourth quarter made it possible to maintain the 
established limits for centralized credit extension, although it 
must be acknowledged that the repeated early transfers of the 
current year's Central Bank profits for the republic budget's 
needs, as well as the sale of banking assets from the 
government's reserve to the Central Bank, played their own role 
here. 
<H8>  The Basic Task for 1994 </H8>
  The consecutive abandonment of the system of centrally 
distributed credits between sectors of the economy and the 
transition to the generally accepted methods of refinancing of 
the commercial banks. 
<H5>  4.2. The Interest Policy </H5>
  The year's most important achievement is increasing the 
interest rates for Central Bank centralized credits to the 
economy and raising them to a level comparable with the level of 
inflation, as a result of which, in December of 1993, the 
commercial banks' loan rates and even the rate for time deposits 
almost became favorable. The dynamics of the Central Bank's 
official rate for centralized credits to the national economy 
developed as follows: 
  as of 29 December 1991 -- 20 percent 
  as of 10 April 1992 -- 50 percent 
  as of 1 July 1992 -- 80 percent 
  as of 30 March 1993 -- 100 percent 
  as of 2 June 1993 -- 110 percent 
  as of 22 June 1993 -- 120 percent 
  as of 29 June 1993 -- 140 percent 
  as of 15 July 1993 -- 170 percent 
  as of 23 September 1993 -- 180 percent 
  as of 15 October 1993 -- 210 percent. 
  While the Central Bank's rate remained unchanged from May of 
1992 through April of 1993, the commercial banks' average credit 
rates increased continuously and the disparity between them 
increased. The successive raising of the Central Bank's rate 
gradually brought it closer to the market rates, especially 
after the joint declaration of the government and the Central 
Bank of 22 May 1993, which established that the interest rate 
for Central Bank credit to the national economy can not be lower 
than the market rate by more than 7 percent. Beginning as of the 
summer, the raising of the Central Bank's rate began to have a 
noticeable impact on the market rates and was conducive to their 
consecutive increase. The market rates for bank credits for a 
term of 1-3 months increased over the year as a whole from 
85-100 percent to 210-250 percent. 
  At the same time, the lack of a normal bank refinancing 
mechanism, the Central Bank's granting of credits to the 
economy's sectors in significant amounts without repayment 
guarantees and real security and the availability of a 
preferential rate for credits to cover the budget deficit are 
still preventing the Central Bank's rate from being converted 
into a really effective instrument of monetary policy, although 
its raising is also one of the most important reasons for the 
slowing down of inflation and the strengthening of the ruble's 
exchange rate. 
  The interest rates for credits and deposits in Russia differ 
substantially by regions and, as a rule, they are higher in 
regions distant from the main banking centers. Therefore, the 
most important task in the area of the interest policy should be 
the formation of a unified and efficient credit market. In 1993, 
the formation was begun of a market for "short-term money," a 
GKO [State Short-Term Bonds] market, and a fairly large number 
of "sites" for trading interbank credits emerged but this is 
still extremely inadequate. The Central Bank's plans for 
organizingon credit auctions in 1993 remained unrealized. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-004L-42A>      The Central Bank Refinancing Rate and Inflation in 1993 </FIG>


  In characterizing the results of the monetary policy, 
attention must be paid to the fact that even the loan rates over 
the course of almost all of 1993 (excluding December) remained 
substantially below the inflation level and this is why the 
general dissatisfaction with the "too high interest rates" has 
no economic basis whatsoever. The most indicative thing in our 
country is comparison on a monthly basis, but even if the 
international methodology (with capitalization of interest) is 
applied to the Central Bank's rate, then 210 percent is 
equivalent to just 600 percent, while prices over the year 
increased by nearly 900 percent. 
  A shortcoming is the fact that the floating interest rate 
technique, a different type of indexing in order to maintain a 
real equivalent of the basic amount of credit over time, is 
still being used poorly. What is positive, however, is the fact 
that the interstate credits to the CIS countries are being 
recorded as of 1993 in a dollar equivalent with calculation of 
the interest according to the LIBOR [London Interbank Offered 
Rate] rate (see the section on relations with the CIS [4.6.]). 
<H8>  The Basic Tasks for 1994 </H8>
  1. Providing a favorable level of interest rates for bank 
deposits, which will make it possible to restore the interest 
and confidence of the public and legal persons in organized 
methods for saving in Russian rubles and will create conditions 
for investing in the economy. 
  2. Developing an efficient Russia-wide interbank market for 
credits and short-term securities, which will make it possible 
to determine interest rates more efficiently, to equalize their 
level for the regions and to carry out special-purpose 
transactions within the framework of monetary regulation of the 
economy. 
  3. Graduallyy lowering the Central Bank's official rate for 
centralized credits to the national economy, if the tendency 
toward a decrease in the rate of inflation acquires a stable 
nature. 
<H5>  4.3. New Monetary Policy Instruments </H5>
  For the first time in recent decades, the normal issuing 
of state securities in the market was successfully begun in 
Russia. In the market 3- and 6-month state short-term bonds 
(GKO-3 and GKO-6, respectively) and "gold certificates" emerged. 
It is hard to talk about the GKO-6, inasmuch as only one 
floating in all of these types of securities has occurred in the 
market, but the course of events in the market involving the 
other two types of state securities makes it possible to draw 
certain conclusions. 
  First, the market trusted the state which, for the first 
time 
in many years, had decided to borrow funds on a universal basis, 
without coercion or deception. Moreover, apparently, the 
confidence which emerged in the GKO-3s (which had already been 
issued eight times and paid off five times) had also spread to 
the other securities issued by the state. 
  Second, a stable trend toward an increase in demand for the 
state securities is taking shape. Of course, even despite the 
impressive rate of increase in the monthly GKO-3 issues (from R1 
billion in May to R130 billion in December), the transaction 
volumes in this market are remaining substantially below the 
transaction volumes in the currency market, but maintaining the 
established rate of increase in demand for GKOs over the course 
of another 6-8 months will make it possible, provided a firm 
financial policy is persistently pursued, to drive the market's 
total capacity for GKO-3s up to R1 trillion by the middle of 
1994 and up to R2 trillion by the end of 1994 and, at the same 
time, the monthly GKO-3 issue volumes will exceed R1 trillion. 
However, the very short repayment term of these securities 
against a background of decreasing inflation will lead to a 
decrease in their "attractiveness" for the state: an ever larger 
portion of the attracted funds will have to go for paying off 
previous issues. The GKO-3s' total "net" contribution to the 
funding of the budget deficit in 1994 will hardly exceed R1 
trillion. Consequently, in the event of the realization of the 
intended goals for suppressing inflation in 1994, beginning as 
of the fourth quarter, the state will have to "reorient" itself 
toward the longer-term GKO-6s, while a specific steady demand 
for GKO-3s will be maintained by financial speculators. If the 
floating of GKO-6s follows approximately along the same 
trajectory as the GKO-3s, then, by 1994's fourth quarter, the 
limit of a R500 billion monthly issue of these securities may be 
"surpassed," while their contribution to the funding of the 
budget deficit will turn out to be more substantial than that of 
the GKO-3s -- approximately R1.5 trillion. In the final tally, 
by the end of 1994, state securities worth around R5 trillion 
will be circulated in the market at the same time. 
  In September, the government adopted the Decree on the 
Issuing of Gold Certificates by the Ministry of Finance in 1993. 
Each gold certificate is a forward contract for the purchase of 
10 kg of gold at the world price. By doing this, several 
problems are solved at once at the same time: the issuing of 
securities fully backed by a precious metal, the protection of 
investors from inflation and assistance to the development of 
the market for gold and securities. The gold certificates have 
been accepted by the market and the demand for them is 
increasing gradually, although the issue rate is lagging 
somewhat behind the calculations, which has been caused by the 
high cost of the securities, a certain complexity in registering 
transactions and the absence of a secondary market for the gold 
certificates, as well as the inadequate legislative base for 
regulating precious metals trading. 
  Obviously, the lower earning potential of the "gold" 
certificates, even with an optimistic improved forecast of an 
increase in gold prices in the world market, in comparison with 
the earning potential of investments in GKOs or interbank 
financial transactions, did not satisfy the "appetite" of 
potential investors. Most likely, the potential state securities 
purchasers' considerations of yield are prevailing over the 
considerations of maintaining liquidity and stability. In this 
situation, the collapse of several large non-state issuers of 
securities may, to a certain extent, increase interest in state 
securities. There is no talk that the state should provoke these 
events, they are occurring anyway, but public opinion needs to 
be widely informed about them and, moreover, under no 
circumstances, should the state take upon itself responsibility 
to the public during the bankruptcy of financial structures (as 
was done in instances involving voucher fraud in Moscow and St. 
Petersburg). 
  Thus, 1993 became the year of the formation of the state 
securities market and laid the groundwork for the relatively 
cheerful prospects for its further development in the coming 
year. 
<H8>  The Basic Tasks for 1994 </H8>
  1. Forming a unified system for a Russia-wide state 
securities market which operates on a real-time basis and 
inherently includes regional financial centers. 
  2. Issuing new, highly liquid, time financial instruments 
intended for the support of civilized methods of refinancing of 
commercial banks. 
  3. Floating newly issued medium-term (1-3 years) bonds with 
a 
flexible interest rate primarily among the public. 
<H5>  4.4. The Problem of Non-Payments </H5>
  The enterprises' mutual non-payments remained one of the 
most painful problems which complicated the conducting of an 
active monetary policy in 1993, and was constantly used by the 
opponents of the reforms as an argument about the unsoundness of 
the financial stabilization policy. 
  Significant amounts of the enterprises' mutual indebtedness 
are not the result of a too harsh financial policy. They have 
been caused, first of all, by the features inherited from the 
planned economy of an economic practice built on the guaranteed 
sale of products based on state orders, the lack of alternative 
solvent customers and the failure to apply harsh economic 
penalties for payment delays. 
  Along with this, among the basic reasons for the 
non-payments 
are: 
  1. Inflation, which gives rise to a shortage of working 
capital (especially among enterprises with a sufficiently 
lengthy production cycle). 
  2. The shift, caused by inflation and the lack of commodity 
credit, of enterprises to prepayment for goods and services, 
additionally stimulating the slump in production. 
  3. The extreme inefficiency of production, the decrease in 
labor productivity and the inability of managers to adjust to 
working under the new conditions (the unwillingness to 
economize, to cut employment, to reduce reserves, to sell off 
unneeded assets, to reduce material and energy consumption, to 
seek new markets, and to change products list). 
  4. The imperfection of the legislation, which makes it 
possible to fail to pay debts with relative impunity (for 
example, the failure to process payment documents by the 
deadlines and the excessive length of the examination of 
lawsuits in the courts of arbitration). 
  Given the lack of a reliable centralized accounting of the 
enterprises' mutual non-payments, their volume is being 
exaggerated everywhere, although it is obvious that the 
acuteness of the discussions on this theme has abated. This is 
no accident, inasmuch as any analytical indicators -- the volume 
of the non-payments in real terms, with respect to the GDP, to 
the volume of industrial production, to the volume of the total 
financial streams and so on -- testify to the fact that a 
decrease in the relative magnitude of the non-payments is 
occurring. A certain increase in the mutual indebtedness in 
absolute terms at the end of 1993 is associated with the fact 
that, prior to 1 October 1993, the accounting of the 
non-payments was done based on the production cost, but 
beginning as of the fourth quarter, it was done in selling 
prices.

  In 1992, the "sectorites" and the Central Bank managed 
successfully to insist on the necessity of carrying out the 
crediting of the enterprises' mutual indebtedness. This measure 
produced a transitory effect at the beginning of the spring of 
1992 and led to an abrupt intensification of the inflation rate 
and a drop in the ruble's exchange rate by year's end. 
Nevertheless, the idea of carrying out a new intersectorial 
crediting is again being placed on the Central Bank's agenda 
with enviable persistence, despite the fact that the 
indebtedness for the credits issued for the completion of 1992's 
crediting has remained unpaid up to the present. Simultaneously 
with the crediting in 1992, significant funds were given out for 
replenishing the enterprises' working capital in order to reduce 
the non-payments and to give financial support to industry. 
Checks have shown that the basic amount of this money was used 
not as intended, rather, it was basically used for the payment 
of wages, which had a strong inflationary effect. 
  In 1993, mutual crediting and indexing of working capital 
was 
successfully avoided and, at the same time, searches for 
noninflationary solutions to the problem were carried out. One 
solution was Presidential Edict No 1662 of 19 October 1993 on 
Improving Settlements in the Economy and Increasing the 
Responsibility for Their Timely Implementation, which provided 
for the compulsory re-registration of the enterprises' overdue 
indebtedness as time debentures -- simple financial notes, upon 
the expiration of the unified deadlines of which, the amount of 
the debt is subject to unconditional recovery from the debtor's 
account or to application to his property, including real 
estate. Despite the large amount of preparatory work for the 
implementation of the edict, its practical realization has been 
unjustifiably delayed because of the frank opposition of a 
number of departments and the unresolved nature of many legal 
problems. 
<H5>  4.5. The Banknote Exchange in July and August of 1993 </H5>
  The sudden exchange at the end of July and the beginning 
of August of 1993 USSR State Bank and Bank of Russia banknotes, 
series 1961-1992, for 1993-series Bank of Russia banknotes was 
implemented by the Central Bank without the knowledge of and 
without coordination with the RF Ministry of Finance, despite a 
preliminary declaration about the gradual withdrawal of 
old-series banknotes up to the end of the year. 
  In objectively assessing this measure, it must be emphasized 
that it turned out to be the only "shock" measure of 1993. 
Besides the obvious lack of technical preparation for this 
action (for example, the lack of small change, the shortage of 
exchange centers and the inadequate degree of safeguards for the 
new banknotes), the exchange of banknotes in Russia and the 
influx which followed it of the cash ruble supply from the near 
abroad (around R1 trillion --17 percent of the cash money supply 
in circulation at the end of July of 1993) provoked a strong 
surge in inflation, a temporary destabilization of the ruble's 
exchange rate and numerous violations of exchange conditions. 
  The public's legitimate dissatisfaction with the money 
exchange's humiliating procedure and time frames sharply 
aggravated the political tension in society, which required 
special measures to adjust the conditions of the exchange even 
as it was going on. 
  In addition to the cited negative consequences, the money 
exchange led to the fact that: 
  -- there was a violation of the law, according to which the 
banknotes are unconditional obligations of the Central Bank and 
the imposition of any kinds of restrictions on their exchange is 
not permitted; 
  -- the unilateral procedure with no warning violated 
obligations to the CIS countries given the lack of a new 
mechanism for monetary relations; 
  -- and the faith of the public and entrepreneurs in the 
government and in the executive power as a whole was undermined 
for the latest time. 
  In deciding on such an unpopular step, the Central Bank's 
management, according to its official explanation, set as the 
main goal a one-time cut-off of the excess ruble supply which 
had been circulating in the republics of the near abroad and 
which had threatened to pour into the Russian market in 
connection with the expected introduction of national currencies 
in these countries. To what extent the Central Bank's intentions 
corresponded to reality is revealed, in particular, by the fact 
that there was an unsanctioned shipment of R50 billion in 
1993-series Russian cash rubles to the Republic of Uzbekistan, 
carried out by the Central Bank immediately after the money 
exchange. 
  Clearly, the Central Bank's position on the negotiations for 
the creation of a "new type of ruble zone," which began almost 
simultaneously with the money exchange and where the Central 
Bank unfailingly discovered a willingness to reunite the 
monetary systems with the CIS republics on terms very favorable 
for them, did not correspond to the set goal -- the final 
separation of the monetary systems of Russia and the near abroad. 
  As a matter of fact, the question of conducting an exchange 
of cash money in the countries participating in the negotiations 
remained open right up to October and November of 1993, when 
Armenia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan deemed as unacceptable the 
conditions put forward by the Russian side for uniting the 
monetary systems and adopted a decision about introducing 
national currencies. The talks about a "new type of ruble zone" 
were stopped (see the section "Mutual Relations with the CIS 
Countries" [4.6.]), 
  The final period in the cash money exchange operation was 
written by the Central Bank's withdrawal from circulation of 
small old-series banknotes (1-25 ruble notes), which was 
completed on 31 December 1993. 
  Thus, a positive result from the money exchange, which 
consisted of stopping the uncontrolled subsidization of the 
republics of the former USSR through free deliveries of cash 
money and separating the monetary systems, was achieved despite 
the Central Bank's attempt to restore the former model of 
relations with the republics' central banks patterned on the 
USSR State Bank. 
<H5>  4.6. Mutual Relations with the CIS Countries </H5>
  The monetary relations with the countries of the so-called 
"ruble zone" in 1993 developed in an extremely complicated 
fashion, which was caused by the contradictions of the absurd 
system which arose after the USSR's disintegration, under which: 
  -- a noncash money turnover, divided as of 1 July 1992 
between Russia and the other republics which used the ruble as a 
means of payment, coexisted with a formally unified cash-money 
turnover; 
  -- the Central Bank continued free deliveries of banknotes 
to 
the central (national) banks of the ruble-zone republics, 
despite their complete autonomy in monetary emission; 
  -- noncash settlements between contracting parties in Russia 
and other ruble-zone states could be carried out only using a 
centralized procedure within the limits of the residual funds in 
the correspondent accounts of the corresponding central 
(national) banks in the RF Central Bank; 
  -- the shortage of funds in correspondent accounts was 
compensated for by the Central Bank by granting the ruble-zone 
republics so-called technical credits without interest being 
levied and by indexing the amount of the debt and the repayment 
guarantees; 
  -- the complete independence of and lack of coordination 
between the ruble-zone states in financial, monetary, currency 
and foreign economic policies caused uncoordinated economic 
reform rates, as a rule, slower than in Russia, higher inflation 
rates and weaker financial discipline. 
  The first quarter of 1993 was spent in continuous attempts 
to 
demolish this system, which generated up to a fourth of the 
inflation processes in Russia. Various methods were used for 
this purpose (to the point of direct bans against the Central 
Bank issuing credits above one-twelfth of the annual limits per 
month and so on), however, their effectiveness remained low, 
inasmuch as the Central Bank, for incomprehensible reasons, 
showed no interest in stopping the basically uncontrolled 
dispensing of funds to the countries of the near abroad.

  The turning point arrived only after the former Supreme 
Soviet's establishment of a ban on granting technical credits 
and the shift to interstate credits through the RF republic 
budget, issued within the bounds of the overall budget limits 
and with a fixed dollar equivalent, specific repayment periods, 
interest rates and security deposits. From 1 January through 20 
April 1993, the distribution of technical credits amounted to 
approximately R850 billion, while a limit for interstate credits 
for the remainder of the year had been established in the amount 
of R895 billion. However, the actual use of interstate credits 
from the budget during the second half of the year barely 
exceeded R500 billion, i.e., the amount of these kinds of 
subsidies to the states of the near abroad decreased in real 
terms by a factor of at least 10. 
  The stopping of technical credits led to a sharp increase in 
applications from the ruble-zone republics for the delivery of 
cash money, which the Central Bank, despite the Ministry of 
Finance's protests, satisfied on an ever increasing scale. The 
RF Central Bank's sudden exchange of cash money in Russia in 
July and August of 1993 caused a panic reaction in many CIS 
member countries, which were not ready for the introduction of 
their own currencies and the complete separation of the monetary 
systems from the RF monetary system. 
  The way in which the introduction of the Russian currency 
took place forced Russia and the ruble-zone countries to 
confront the need for a quick solution to the problem of 
organizing monetary and settlement relations on a new basis. The 
starting point in this matter was the joint declaration of the 
presidents of Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan about the 
creation of a "new type of ruble zone" (RZNT), adopted 
immediately during the period of the money exchange in Russia. 
The lengthy negotiations, the participants in which in addition 
to Russia, were Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and 
Tajikistan, were completed with the signing of the framework 
multilateral Agreement on Practical Measures for the Creation of 
a New Type of Ruble Zone and Russia's bilateral agreements with 
each of the countries which participated in the negotiations on 
uniting the monetary systems. 
  Of key importance in these agreements was the statement 
about 
the necessity of a transition period, by which means the 
immediate reuniting of the monetary systems of Russia and the 
ruble-zone countries was removed from the agenda. Over the 
course of the transition period, the countries participating in 
the agreements were obliged to carry out the standardization of 
economic legislation and the coordination of monetary, 
financial, credit, currency, customs and price policies, as well 
as to support the stability of the exchange rate for the 
national currencies with respect to the ruble and to shift 
gradually to mutual convertibility of the national currencies. 
In addition to this, subject to coordination with the Russian 
side were the key macroeconomic indicators: an increase in the 
amount of the money supply, the budget deficit, the inflation 
rate and others. 
  It turned out to be impossible to realize the conditions 
stipulated by the agreements for the standardization of 
legislation and the establishment of effective regulatory 
mechanisms over the course of a few months. Serious differences 
had also been uncovered in the approaches to the implementation 
of the agreements between Russia and the other countries which 
participated in the negotiations, which were interested, first 
of all, in ensuring the exchange of cash money for the 
new-series Russian rubles on the same terms as within Russia. 
The remaining elements of the mechanism for the uniting of the 
monetary systems (the consolidation of the budgets, the 
organization of a currency market and the standardization of the 
settlement mechanism) were viewed at this time as secondary. 
  Under these conditions, despite the RF Central Bank's 
willingness to have every possible relaxation of the criteria 
for uniting the monetary systems on the basis of the Russian 
ruble, Russia's economic interests required the complete 
fulfillment of the agreements by the parties which signed them. 
The increase in political tension in the participating countries 
of the new-type ruble zone in connection with the unsettled 
nature of the matter of the exchange of old banknotes and the 
mutual apprehensions because of the possibility of the 
uncoordinated introduction of the national currencies 
predetermined the suspension of the negotiations with Armenia, 
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. In November of 1993, these countries 
introduced national currencies; in Belarus, temporary banknotes 
had already been in circulation since 1992 and the matter of the 
exchanging of old banknotes in this republic did not come up. Of 
all the participants in the agreements on the new-type ruble 
zone, the one which turned out to be in the most difficult 
situation was Tajikistan, to which the Russian Government 
granted a special interstate credit for a term of 6 months in 
cash Russian rubles in order to stabilize the nearly destroyed 
economy and monetary turnover. 
  The new-type ruble zone did not go through. Despite the 
failure of the agreements, integration with the republics of the 
former [Soviet] Union in the area of finances and credit is one 
of the indisputable priorities of Russia's economic policy and 
the suspension of the talks on the new-type ruble zone does not 
mean the abandonment of the set goal. However, the process of 
financial and credit integration, as the experience of other 
countries shows, takes a long time and requires the convergence 
of the levels of economic development, the harmonization of 
economic legislation and the fulfillment of a whole series of 
other conditions. On the other hand, there is no possibility for 
viability on the part of pseudo-integration structures, in which 
the groundwork has been laid from the outset for conflict 
between the economic and political interests of the parties, for 
example, in no place and at no time has there ever been nor can 
there ever be a single currency and two emission banks. 
  Unfortunately, these are precisely the kinds of items which 
have turned out to be embedded in the interbank agreement 
between the RF Central Bank and the NB [National Bank] of 
Belarus, which was signed at the beginning of January of 1994. 
At the same time, the drafts of the documents on uniting the 
monetary systems of Russia and Belarus contained no proposals 
for uniting budgets, customs and currency control -- as a matter 
of fact, a question was raised about the gratis transfer by 
Russia to Belarus of cash and noncash money, moreover, at an 
exchange rate of 1:1, even though the market exchange rate for 
Belarussian rubles currently amounts to 4-5 for 1 [Russian] 
ruble. 
  Such a position, taken exclusively out of business and 
political considerations and based on elementary economic 
ignorance, in the event of its realization, may have the 
following consequences: 
  -- the large-scale subsidization of Belarus at the expense 
of 
Russia; 
  -- an increase in the price-increase index by 3-5 percent; 
  -- complications with former partners in the new-type ruble 
zone, which had not obtained similar preferential conditions for 
the uniting of the monetary systems. 
  In considering the political and economic realities of the 
present day, it must be acknowledged that reaching an agreement 
on uniting the monetary systems is possible only when there is: 
  -- the unconditional retention of a single emission bank, 
which means the conversion of the Central Bank of Belarus into a 
branch of the Bank of Russia without the right of emission. At 
the same time, the mutual relations of Belarus' budget with 
Russia's budget should be organized in a manner similar to the 
procedure which operates in the relationship of Russia's 
republic budget with the budgets of RF entities; 
  -- an exchange of money in the event of the merging of the 
monetary systems at the market exchange rate; 
  -- and approval of the decision about uniting the monetary 
systems in the State Duma -- this key question cannot be solved 
on the basis of agreements between the central banks or 
spontaneous decisions of the executive power. 
  What has been said pertains not just to Belarus, but also to 
all the CIS countries which are striving for closer financial 
and credit integration with Russia. This process will take a 
long time and any hasty attempts to obtain short-term political 
dividends will inflict damage on both Russia's interests and the 
economic integration goals. Despite serious opposition, in 1993, 
the Ministry of Finance managed to uphold this key position and 
to prevent the adoption of economically unsound and technically 
unprepared decisions. 
  The immutability of this position even in the future remains 
the main task of the monetary and financial policies 
for 1994. At the same time, at this stage the fastest possible 
establishment of practical mechanisms which ensure the mutual 
convertibility of the Russian ruble and the CIS countries' 
currencies is extremely important and will make it possible to 
solve the most painful problems in the organization of 
commercial and noncommercial payments within the framework of 
the Commonwealth and to shape gradually the prerequisites for a 
Payment Union. 
<H5>  4.7. The Development of the Stock Market </H5>
  In 1993, the volume of shares issued by non-state issuers 
increased continuously. In all, offered for public investment 
were shares worth R3.9 trillion in comparison with R315 billion 
in 1992 (an increase faster than the rate of inflation). The 
issuing of bonds in 1993 amounted in all to R1.1 billion (R1 
billion for AVTOVAZ and the rest for municipal loans). Federal 
budget receipts from the registration of issued securities came 
to R4 billion, while the total amount of the securities 
transaction tax came to R29 billion. 
  The majority of issuers declared as the goal of the share 
emissions the attracting of resources for long-term investments. 
The basic issuers are private enterprises, ones undergoing 
privatization, banks and investment and finance companies. It 
may be stated that securities have been turned into the most 
important instrument for the accumulation of monetary assets not 
only for institutional investors, but also for the public. A 
number of companies carried out secondary securities emissions. 
  Noticeable changes have occurred in the stock market's 
infrastructure, which have been manifested, first of all, in the 
decrease in the number of stock exchanges and the concentration 
of securities trading. Thus, whereas 98 Ministry of Finance 
licenses were in effect at the end of 1992, by the end of 1993, 
their number had decreased to 72. 
  Going on at the same time is the active establishment of 
investment structures which service the non-exchange market. 
Listed in the Ministry of Finance's register are 1,035 
institutes, the overwhelming majority of which operate as 
brokers (700), consultants and investment companies. The end of 
1993 was marked by the emergence of specialized institutes 
associated with the organization of the secondary securities 
market (associations of investment firms, depositaries, 
registrars and clearing houses). The necessary amendments and 
changes to the normative and legal base of the stock market were 
introduced at the same time. 
The Basic Tasks for 1994 
  1. Comprehensive stimulation of the development of the 
capital market as a source of investment resources. 
  2. Ensuring the protection of investors from dishonest 
issuers. 
<H5>  5. External Aspects of the Financial Policy </H5>
<H5>  5.1. The Currency Policy </H5>
  Russia's currency policy in 1993 was characterized by 
relative consistency. A currency market was developed, the 
ruble's exchange rate was strengthened substantially and its 
role in the economy increased, import subsidies were abolished 
and decisions against dollarization adopted, the gold and 
currency reserves increased and the formation of a 
currency-control system was begun. In the area of currency 
policy, the cooperation between the Ministry of Finance and the 
Central Bank was at a sufficiently high level. 
<H5>  5.1.1. Russia's Currency Policy </H5>
  A number of decisions were made in 1993 on the regulation 
of the currency market, which assisted its development and the 
strengthening of the ruble: 
  -- on 27 May, the Central Bank introduced a new procedure 
for 
the management by authorized banks of an open currency position; 
  -- as of 1 July, exporters began to sell 30 percent of 
currency earnings not to the Central Bank, but rather, through 
the currency market (i.e., in all, 50 percent went through the 
market); Russia's Ministry of Finance had been insisting on this 
measure since February; 
  -- and, on 15 July, non-residents were permitted to sell 
currency in the domestic Russian market (also due to pressure 
from the Ministry of Finance). 
  1993 was marked by the continuation of the rapid development 
of the Russian currency market in three basic directions; 
  -- an increase in the transaction volumes; 
  -- expansion of the number of quoted currencies; 
  -- and expansion of the currency market's geographical 
distribution. 
  The volume of currency transactions recorded in Russia's 
exchanges in 1993 amounted to $14.71 billion as against $2.86 
billion in 1992 and only $280 million in 1991. Taking into 
account the sales outside the organized market, the total 
turnover of the currency transactions in 1993 can be estimated 
at $20 billion, i.e., the market remained primarily an exchange 
market. Interbank conversion transactions have not yet been 
widely developed, but their scale is increasing steadily. 
  The Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (MMVB), in which 85 
percent of Russia's entire dollar exchange turnover in 1993 
occurred, remains the basic exchange. At the end of the year, 
150 banks were exchange members. Other exchanges are operating 
in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Vladivostok and 
Rostov-on-Don. 
  The overwhelming majority of currency transactions are being 
carried out on "spot" terms, but an organized futures market (a 
standard currency contract market with future delivery) has 
already been developed, as well as separate interbank forward 
transactions. 
  The U.S. dollar remains the leading currency in Russia's 
market -- not less than 60-70 percent, and the second most 
important currency is the German mark. Attempts to carry out 
trades in Austrian schillings, French francs, pounds sterling 
and Italian lira, and in the regional exchanges -- in Finnish 
marks and Japanese yen -- were noted in 1993.

  As of March of 1993, in the Moscow Interbank Currency 
Exchange, they began practicing transactions with the Ukrainian 
karbovanets. The preparations have been completed for trades in 
the Kazakh tenge and the Belarussian ruble. It is worth noting 
that, when the National Bank of Ukraine introduced a fixed 
exchange rate for the karbovanets to the ruble and SKV [freely 
convertible currency], the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange 
remained the only free market in which a karbovanets exchange 
rate was formed. However, the introduction of quotations for the 
currencies of the countries of the former USSR in 1993 has been 
unjustifiably dragged out and it should be accelerated. 
  In 1993, a significant disparity was observed in the 
quotations in various markets, but, based on the extent of the 
development of the transaction technique and currency arbitrage, 
this disparity had a tendency to decrease. The number of 
currency transaction participants has expanded substantially. 
The buying and selling of currency has become a daily routine 
for many industrial enterprises. The number of banks with 
currency licenses has reached nearly 600. 
  The cash currency market developed rapidly. The number of 
exchange centers of the bureaus has increased many times over 
and even the Central Bank does not know their total number. 
Mobile exchange centers have appeared. The disparity between 
cash and noncash exchange rates has decreased somewhat. Service 
efficiency has increased, although the poor control over the 
exchange centers' activities is leading to numerous violations 
(a lack of licenses, a refusal to accept dilapidated banknotes 
and certain types of banknotes, a periodic shortage of rubles 
and a lack of registration of transactions). 
  Over the course of 1993, the Central Bank acted both as a 
seller and a purchaser of currency, basically carrying out a 
policy of leveling the ruble's exchange rate. On the whole, over 
the year, the Central Bank turned out to be the largest net 
purchaser of currency (taking into account the direct sales of 
currency to it by the Ministry of Finance), since it tried to 
prevent an artificial strengthening of the ruble's exchange 
rate. On the whole, over the year, the Central Bank purchased 
$2.8 billion in the market and $3.7 billion from the Ministry of 
Finance, i.e., the sum of R6.5 billion, and sold only $4.0 
billion, which debunks the myth about artificial support of the 
ruble's exchange rate. In fact, the Central Bank was supporting 
the dollar's exchange rate in Russia. It can be asserted 
unambiguously that the ruble's exchange rate reflects the 
existing economic realities. 
  The Central Bank's large-scale interventions in the currency 
market were basically the sole instrument of the monetary policy 
and led to a substantial increase in the Central Bank's currency 
reserves. The Central Bank's attempt to purchase more currency 
than it sold, which means the pumping of an additional emission 
into the economy, prompted the Ministry of Finance at the end of 
the year to establish its own system for selling currency 
through the commercial banks, but, in reality, it was almost 
never used. 
<H8>  The Basic Tasks for 1994 </H8>
  1. The development of an interbank market and forward 
transactions. 
  2. The removal of the remaining restrictions on the buying, 
selling, importing and exporting of foreign currency and Russian 
rubles in order to achieve genuine convertibility. 
  3. The development of trading in the currencies of the near 
abroad and other reserve currencies. 
  4. A more considered use of currency interventions as an 
instrument of monetary policy. 
<H5>  5.1.2 The Ruble's Exchange Rate </H5>
  In 1993, the ruble's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar 
fell from R417 (5 January) to R1,247 (30 December) to the 
dollar, i.e., by a factor of 3. At the same time, the tendency 
of its movement can be divided into two stages: from the 
beginning of the year to the middle of June, when the exchange 
rate was at the R1,116 mark, and the following 6 months, when 
the exchange rate first strengthened and then fell by 12 percent. 
  Taking inflation into account, the ruble's actual exchange 
rate and, consequently, it purchasing power in 1993 increased by 
a factor of 3 (9:3). I.e., 1992's trend, when the actual 
exchange rate increase by a factor of almost 9 (26:2.8), 
continued. At the same time, in the first half of the year, the 
drop in the ruble's nominal exchange rate almost kept pace with 
inflation and was one of its sources and, in the second half of 
the year, the ruble's exchange rate remained very stable, while 
prices increased by a factor of almost 3. As a result, a 
significan convergence of the levels of domestic and foreign 
prices occurred. 
  The basic reasons for the strengthening of the Russian ruble 
lie in the tightening up of the budget and monetary policies and 
the change in the mechanism of the currency market. Of specific 
psychological significance was the receipt at the beginning of 
July of 1993 of the first part of the IMF system credit, but it 
was not this which was decisive for the correlation of supply 
and demand. The measures adopted and announced by the government 
at the beginning of the summer radically changed the inflation 
expectations in Russia. In the second half of the year, even the 
currency speculators believed in the impossibility of a 
"collapse" of the exchange rate and in its close connection with 
the pursued economic policy. 
  In 1993, the ruble became more attractive as an object of 
short-term investments and a means of payment. The conversion of 
foreign currency into rubles and their depositing in Russian 
banks in the second half of the year gave investors colossal 
profits. The development of market relations, the high interest 
rates and the stable exchange rate caused an influx of funds 
from the near abroad. For example, many enterprises, citizens 
and even government bodies of the near abroad are now keeping 
money in Russia for protection from inflation, "shuttles" from 
Belarus and Ukraine have congested Russian cities in the race 
for rubles and a tendency toward trips into Russia to make money 
has emerged. 
  The strengthening of the Russian ruble had the following 
consequences: 
  -- a lowering of inflation expectations; the role of the 
movement of the currency exchange rate in inflation under our 
conditions is extremely complicated to assess, but it is evident 
that the exchange rate could not, for the time being, play the 
role of a nominal anchor in the suppression of inflation; 
  -- some lowering of the increase in prices through the 
channel of the prices for imported goods, first and foremost, 
consumer goods; 
  -- the facilitation of importing; the ruble's understated 
exchange rate made imported goods unjustifiably costly and 
domestic ones too cheap; this led to demands for the 
subsidization of importing (import factors) and budget losses 
and, on the other hand, to the exporting from Russia for next to 
nothing of raw material riches and other goods, for which the 
government was constantly being criticized by the opposition; 
the relatively stable ruble led to a sharp increase in importing 
via private channels, which fundamentally changed the picture in 
retail trade; 
  -- a decrease in the competitiveness of exporting; the 
ruble's stabilization showed that a significant portion of the 
exporting was highly inefficient because of the low labor 
productivity and technological backwardness; the convergence of 
the domestic and foreign prices initiated the structural 
reorganization of industry and agriculture, when survival and 
exporting opportunities depend on production efficiency. 
  Under these conditions, it is necessary to eliminate all the 
artificial restrictions on exporting, which were imposed at one 
time in an attempt to "saturate" the domestic market. The 
government has already lowered the export duties and cut back on 
the practice of setting quotas, but this is insufficient and, in 
1994, they should be completely abolished. The attempts to 
"protect" inefficient production using the import duties run the 
risk of preserving stagnation and closing foreign markets to us, 
since retaliatory measures will inevitably be taken.

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-004L-54A>      Figure 16. Currency Purchase Volumes in Russia's Currency Exchanges </FIG>


<H8>  The Basic Tasks for 1994 </H8>
  1. The continuation of the policy of smoothing out market 
fluctuation in the currency exchange rate, i.e., the abandonment 
of official interventions in order to maintain the exchange rate 
at a fixed level. 
  2. The pursuit of sufficiently harsh financial and monetary 
policies aimed at strengthening the national currency. 
  3. An increase in the ruble's actual exchange rate by a 
factor of approximately 2. This means that, when prices increase 
by a factor of 3-4, the nominal exchange rate will not fall 
below R2,500 to the dollar. Given an increase in prices by a 
factor of 20, the exchange rate will amount to a minimum of 
R12,000. Based on the extent of the convergence of domestic and 
foreign prices, it will draw closer to the parity of the 
purchasing power. The separation will be preserved, but it will 
decrease based on the extent of the development of the 
commodity, currency and credit markets and the removal of 
protectionist barriers. 
  However, all this will depend on the financial and monetary 
policies pursued. The events of January of 1994, when the ruble 
lost more than a fourth of its value because of the political 
uncertainty, confirm the market's sensitivity to the 
government's policies. 
<H5>  5.1.3. Russia's Gold and Currency Reserves </H5>
  Russia's official gold and currency reserves are being 
formed from the reserves of the Central Bank and the government 
(the latter are under the control of the Ministry of Finance). 
In both instances, the reserves include gold and foreign 
convertible currency, although the Central Bank and the 
government also have at their disposal substantial reserves of 
other precious metals (palladium, silver, platinum and others) 
and stones (basically diamonds). 
  The Central Bank is storing its own currency reserves 
basically in foreign central and commercial banks, while the 
Ministry of Finance's currency reserves are in the Vneshtorgbank 
[Foreign Trade Bank] and a number of Russia's largest commercial 
banks. 
  In November of 1993, the Central Bank consented to a 
transaction, unique in world practice, for purchasing uncut 
diamonds from the government for $500 million, which were later 
sold for rubles to replenish the budget. 
  The increase in Russia's international reserves occurred in 
1993 basically due to foreign currency, while the gold reserves 
did not change substantially. Russia's net international 
reserves increased in 1993 from $2.8 billion to $6.1 billion by 
the end of November. During this period, the foreign liabilities 
increased by approximately R1 billion, i.e., the gross reserves 
increased even more substantially. The liabilities increased 
basically due to the Ministry of Finance's debt to the IMF. At 
the same time, the VEB [Foreign Economic Activity Bank] reduced 
its own foreign liabilities, paying off almost $500 million on 
the former USSR's debt. 
<H8>  Basic Tasks for 1994 </H8>
  1. A further increase in the Central Bank's reserves as a 
means for supporting monetary emission. 
  2. A gradual concentrating of all reserves in the Central 
Bank's hands. 
  3. An increase in efficiency in the management of the 
currency reserves.

<H5>  5.1.4. Dollarization </H5>
  Dollarization objectively expanded in the first half of 
1993, although, based on the extent of the stabilization of the 
ruble's exchange rate, this process went into reverse. The basic 
reasons for dollarization are inflation, unfavorable interest 
rates and the poor state of settlements. The scale of cash 
dollarization is estimated to be several billion dollars and it 
is likely that domestic settlements in currency are of a similar 
size. At the same time, the flight to dollars and other foreign 
currencies is not being affected (see The Flight of Capital 
[5.2.2.]). 
  A significant portion of the well-off circles of the 
population, including those which exert influence on the 
adoption of decisions in the state, has essentially begun to 
live in a parallel dollar economy. At the same time, the 
necessity of suppressing inflation was not as imperative for 
them, since it frequently produced an opportunity to get rich by 
speculating. 
  Over the course of the entire year, the Ministry of Finance, 
acting alone, tried to obtain the adoption of decisions against 
dollarization, but it found no support. Only after 21 September 
did the Central Bank finally issue a document about stopping, as 
of 1 January 1994, payments in cash currency -- precisely in 
conformity with the Ministry of Finance's demands. At the same 
time, cash currency deposited by non-banking institutions will 
be accepted, but it will not earn interest. 
  The decision caused inconvenience for the holders of cash 
currency and required a few more rubles, but it was implemented 
calmly on the whole and, at the same time, powerful stimulation 
was given to the distribution of debit and credit cards and the 
ruble expanded its own monetary functions, creating the 
prerequisites for more effective monetary regulation. 
  At the same time, final victory over dollarization is 
possible only if there are suppression of inflation, the 
attainment of favorable rates for rubles and substantial 
improvement in the system for settlements in rubles. 
Nevertheless, the adopted decisions are creating powerful 
compelling motives and a basis for intensifying the struggle 
against inflation. 
<H5>  5.2. Currency Control </H5>
<H5>  5.2.1. The Organization of Currency Control </H5>
  By law, the basic functions of currency control have been 
entrusted to the Central Bank, as well as to the Russian Federal 
Service for Currency and Export Control. 
  The federal service, in point of fact, had only begun to 
take 
shape in 1993 and only as of the middle of October did it begin 
its practical activities: checking the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations for observance of the law during the 
exporting of strategically important raw material goods, 
checking the foreign trade associations with regard to the 
timeliness of the repatriation of currency earnings and 
selective checking of the currency exchange centers. The 
preliminary amount of the penalties for the conducted checks 
comes to around $100 million. 
  The Central Bank also did not achieve substantial results in 
the area of currency control: 
  1. There was no regulation of the exchange centers' 
activities and the Central Bank does not even know the number of 
them in the country. Only at the beginning of 1994 were the 
appropriate instructions prepared by the Central Bank. 
  2. The Central Bank does not have data about the importing 
and exporting of currency and attempts are just being undertaken 
to prepare the corresponding statistics. The GTK [State Customs 
Committee] estimates the exporting of cash currency in 1993 at 
$3.7 billion. 
  3. In the procedure for penalties for violation of currency 
control, almost no currency licenses were withdrawn from banks, 
measures were not taken against enterprises which refused to 
accept rubles and there were no closings of exchange centers 
which defraud customers (for example, collecting a premium for 
exchanging dilapidated notes). Certain companies of the "GMM" 
type, given such connivance, unleashed a flurry of currency 
activities without any legal bases for this. 
  4. On the whole, the banking system remains the weakest spot 
in the currency control system. It has not yet been possible to 
really set up cooperation with the control organs of other 
states. 
  In fulfillment of the RF Law on Currency Regulation and 
Currency Control, the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank and 
the State Customs Committee worked out and adopted the Statute 
on the Procedure for the Exporting and Remitting from the 
Russian Federation and Remitting to the Russian Federation of 
Russian Federation Currency. This statute makes the control 
system clearer and stricter. 
  The decree On the Procedure for the Movement by Natural 
Persons Across the RF Customs Border of Goods not Intended for 
Porductio or Other Comerial Activities was worked out jointly 
with the State Customs Committee and other departments and 
adopted by the government on 23 December 1993. This decision 
reduced the value of goods which could be shipped across the 
border duty-free from $5,000 to $2,000 and eliminated other 
benefits and discrepancies in order to curtail foreign trading 
under the guise of private crossings and to increase budget 
revenues. 
  In the second half of 1993, proposals were prepared on the 
organization of control over the timely and complete 
repatriation to Russia of export earnings and other sums and the 
importing and exporting from the RF by residents and 
non-residents of currency assets, as well as for the improvement 
of the standards base, which provides for the strengthening of 
accountability for violations of the rules for currency turnover 
in Russia. 
  Significant amounts of freely convertible currency were used 
in 1993 in order to carry out private "shuttle" importing into 
Russia. For example, according to the State Customs Committee's 
data, just in the first half of the year, around 130,000 
foreign-made motor vehicles were imported privately into Russia. 
Firm importing has been partially concealed behind this figure, 
a substantial one for Russia, in order to avoid the payment of 
import tariffs. There are no reliable estimates of the "shuttle" 
importing of consumer goods, just as there are no estimates of 
the currency exported for this purpose. According to the State 
Committee for Statistics' data, the volume of unregistered 
importing amounted in 1993 to $10 billion. Currency control in 
this instance proved to be extremely ineffective. 
<H5>  5.2.2. The Flight of Capital </H5>
  In 1993, the problems of the flight of capital were widely 
debated. While doing this, the opposition used increasingly 
unlikely capital-outflow figures -- $10 billion, $17 billion, 
$30 billion and $80 billion. It was asserted that, because of 
this, the budget has a deficit and that decisive measures need 
only be taken and the state of the economy and the standard of 
living will immediately be improved dramatically. It is clear 
that two factors have become interwoven here -- economic 
ignorance and the traditional longing for a "magic wand," with 
the aid of which all problems can be solved easily and quickly. 
  In fact, the problem of the flight of capital arises from 
the 
following elements: 
  1. The attempt not to repatriate export earnings and other 
currency receipts in order to avoid the obligatory sale and 
taxation. It is quite natural that the political and economic 
instability is driving many firms to these actions. 
  It is extremely doubtful that there are more than $5-10 
billion in such funds abroad. Even if they had been repatriated 
to Russia, a large portion of them would not have gone into the 
state budget, since the bulk of them are private funds. 
  2. The enterprises' attempt to keep earned funds in foreign 
currency, the "flight from the ruble," can also be regarded as 
an outflow of capital and, simultaneously, as a manifestation of 
the dollarization of the economy. The fact that almost $20 
billion are officially in the accounts of Russian legal persons 
is a manifestation of the lack of confidence in the ruble and 
leads to the understatement of its exchange rate. 
  3. The attempt to export from Russia accumulated capital in 
currency form is a violation of the law. 
  It is obvious that the outflow of capital is disadvantageous 
for the Russian economy and, at times, a desire is expressed to 
impose administrative restrictions on the movement of currency 
assets, although the main direction of reform should be the 
almost complete abolition of restrictions on the movement of 
capital and comprehensive liberalization of currency conditions. 
However, it is necessary to have a reliable control system 
before abolishing the existing restrictions. Consequently, the 
two most important conditions for stopping the flight of capital 
consist of the following: 
  setting up effective currency control; lowering inflation; 
stabilizing the economic and political situation in the country. 
<H5>  5.3. Relations with International Organizations and the G7 </H5>
  In 1993, Russia's consultations with international 
financial organizations intensified significantly. On the whole, 
over the year which passed after Russia's entry into the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank's group (as 
of November of 1992), Russia received around $3.5 billion from 
international financial organizations. More modest were the sums 
in the mutual relations with the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (YeBRR [EBRD]). 
<H5>  5.3.1. The International Monetary Fund </H5>
  In 1992, Russia received from the IMF the first part of 
the reserve (Standby) credit in the amount of 719 million SDRs 
[Special Drawing Right] ($1 billion), which was placed in 
deposit accounts in the Central Bank. In September of 1993, $500 
million of this money was spent to pay the foreign debt. 
  In 1993, after the adoption of the declaration of the 
government and the Central Bank on economic policy and the 
implementation of a number of important measures, the first part 
of the special credit for the support of the reforms (STF) of 
1.1 billion SDRs ($1.5 billion) was received, the funds of which 
were used in July and August to fund the state's budget deficit. 
  The agreements with the IMF provide for granting credits in 
two parts. The first part is distributed upon the conclusion of 
an agreement, while the second part is distributed upon the 
attainment of agreed-upon macroeconomic indicators. Due to the 
fact that Russia could not achieve substantial progress in 
achieving financial stabilization, the grant of the second part 
of the credits was delayed and now talks are being held on the 
resumption of the extension of credit at the beginning of 1994. 
<H5>  5.3.2. The International Bank for Reconstruction and </H5>
Development 
  The World Bank's program provides for granting to Russia 
funds in the amount of around $2.5-4.0 billion annually. In 
1992, the MBRR [International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development -- IBRD] granted Russia the first part of a 
rehabilitation loan in the amount of $600 million. In 1993, $390 
million of these funds were used. 
  In 1993, two agreements were signed with the IBRD: a 
rehabilitation loan for the oil industry ($610 million) and a 
loan for the implementation of the privatization program ($120 
million). The signing of a second rehabilitation loan, planned 
for the end of 1993, is being delayed in connection with the 
fact that it has been linked with the IMF's granting of the 
second part of the STF credit. 
  Agreements have been reached and are intended to be signed 
in 
1994 for loans for housing construction, for the rehabilitation 
and maintenance of highways, for municipal transport, for the 
development of exporting, for the structural reorganization of 
enterprises, for improvement of the financial and banking 
sphere, for the development of employment and social protection 
services, for ecological needs, and for training personnel. 
  Russia's payments to the IBRD have been formalized by means 
of a tender for 44,795 shares for the sum of U.S. $300 million, 
which amounts to 2.99 percent of the total amount of the bank's 
charter capital. As stipulated by the IBRD's rules, $33.4 
million have been paid directly, while notes in rubles have been 
drawn up for the remaining amount. 
<H5>  5.3.3. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development </H5>
  The European Bank is financing projects in the private and 
state sectors of the countries of Eastern Europe and the 
republics of the former USSR. At the same time, in accordance 
with the bank's charter, up to 60 percent of its investments are 
supposed to go for investments in the non-state sphere. 
  Prior to 1993, EBRD loans for the state were not granted to 
Russia. In 1993, agreements were signed and went into effect on 
loans for the rehabilitation of Western Siberia's oil and gas 
wells ($174.3 million) and for privatization technical 
assistance ($43.8 million). At the end of 1993, a framework 
agreement was signed between the Russian Government and the EBRD 
on credits for the oil-producing associations, which define the 
general conditions for the EBRD's extension of credit to 
individual Russian oil-producing associations without state 
guarantees on the part of Russia. 
  Based on the status at the end of 1993, the bank's Board of 
Directors approved 16 projects for realization in Russia, the 
overall value of which is estimated to be 1.3 billion ECUs 
[European Currency Unit] ($1.7 billion). The EBRD's proposed 
participation in these projects comes to around 500 million 
ECUs. Another 19 projects are in the preparation stage. 
Basically, these projects pertain to the energy and transport 
sectors, as well as to the financial sphere. 
  Work is continuing on the EBRD's project for the development 
of small and medium-sized business in Russia, which provides for 
the establishment jointly with the leading "Seven" countries of 
a fund for small and medium-sized business in the amount of $300 
million. The program provides for the extension of credit to 
small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as for the fund's 
participation in their charter capital. 
  At the same time, the effectiveness of the cooperation with 
the EBRD remains clearly below its potential. To date, within 
the framework of the realization of the projects for the state, 
only $7.6 million of the bank's loan funds have been used. At 
the same time, Russia has already paid $56 million into the 
EBRD's charter capital and another $84 million are supposed to 
be paid in the next few years. 
<H5>  5.3.4. The Multilateral Investment Guaranty Agency (MAGI) </H5>
  In February of 1993, the Russian Government approved the 
issuing of MAGI [MIGA] guarantees for an investment project in 
the RF, which the Belgian firm, Multiserv International N.V., 
intends to carry out. The total amount of the investments for 
this project will come to $11 million and the size of the 
guarantee is $9.9 million. 
<H5>  5.3.5. The International Finance Corporation (MFK) </H5>
  When granting credit, the MFK [IFC] does not require state 
guarantees, but rather, it concludes agreements directly with 
enterprises and organizations. According to the Ministry of 
Finance's information, at the present time, IFC funds are 
beginning to be received within the framework of four projects. 
The IFC is contemplating investing in all $61.5 million in the 
oil-producing industry. In addition, up to $23 million will be 
granted to the Russian private sector and to joint ventures 
through the International Moscow Bank and the Framlington 
Investment Fund. 
  In 1993, $52.8 million were paid to the IFC as membership 
dues and, up to 1996, another $28.5 million will have to be 
paid. Dividends are paid annually on the funds deposited by the 
RF in the charter capital of the IMF, the IBRD, the EBRD, the 
MIGA, the MAR [International Development Association -- IDA], 
and the IFC. 
<H5>  5.3.6. The "Big Seven" </H5>
  In 1993, for the first time, talks with the countries of 
the "Big Seven" were placed on a permanent basis. A simple list 
of the meetings which have taken place testifies to the 
intensity of the contacts: 
  March -- a meeting with the sherpas [technical experts] in 
Hong Kong; 
  April -- a meeting of the ministers of finance and foreign 
affairs in Tokyo; 
  July -- a summit meeting in Tokyo based on the formula 7+1; 
  September -- a meeting with the ministers of finance and the 
chairmen of the central banks in Washington during the annual 
meeting of the IMF/IBRD; 
  and December -- a meeting with the sherpas in Paris. 
  It is necessary to emphasize not only the regularity, but 
also the highly representative nature of the talks held, in 
which Russia participated on an equal basis and, in a number of 
instances, acted as the direct initiator of the discussion of 
one question or another. A fact which reflects the recognition 
of Russia's status as an equal partner is its advance invitation 
to the next summit of the "Seven" in Naples in 1994. 
  The central event of the year in the relations with the "Big 
Seven" countries was unquestionably the July summit meeting in 
Tokyo. The understandings reached in the Japanese capital during 
the April consultations of the ministers of finance and foreign 
affairs were confirmed and developed further there. The results 
of the Tokyo round were of important significance for stirring 
up the West's efforts to give assistance to the economic reforms 
in Russia, giving the international assistance a more specific 
and purposeful nature. 
  The following items can be regarded as among the most 
substantial understandings about supporting Russia, announced 
based on the results of the meeting: 
  -- the granting of IMF credit for the purposes of system 
transformations ($3 billion); 
  -- the granting of an IBRD rehabilitation loan ($600 
million); 
  -- the rendering of financial support to the process of the 
privatization and restructuring of industrial enterprises ($2 
billion, including free assistance); 
  -- the establishment under the management of the EBRD of a 
fund for supporting the development of small and medium-sized 
business ($300 million); 
  -- the obtaining from the "Seven" countries of new export 
credits (up to $10 billion); 
  -- and the restructuring and deferment of payments on the 
foreign debt. 
  The rendering of assistance was conditioned on the adherence 
of the Russian leadership's course to the continuation of 
reforms and on progress in the attainment of the financial 
stabilization goals. The government's retreat in the fall of 
last year from the accepted obligations led to a delay in the 
implementation of many assistance programs. Problems also arose 
among the Western partners, which were associated, in 
particular, with the comprehension of the necessity of 
abandoning standard approaches and schemes of cooperation and 
with the difficulties with the mobilization of the promised 
financial assets. 
  In 1993, Russia received from the IMF only half of the 
credit 
for the purpose of system transformations. The granting of the 
remaining funds was postponed because of the deterioration of 
the financial situation in the country. The same fate befell 
almost completely the rehabilitation loan prepared and agreed 
upon with the IBRD. 
  The preparation of two loans by the IBRD and the EBRD for a 
total amount of $800 million within the framework of the program 
for financial support of privatization and restructuring has 
almost been completed. A free aid package for investments in 
fixed capital is also being put together. The program's 
uniqueness consists of the fact that the funds will be sent 
directly to enterprises through Russian commercial banks. 
  The formation of the fund for support of small and 
medium-sized business is being delayed. The "Seven" countries 
have not deposited into the fund the portion of the assets which 
is their share. The EBRD has independently started on the 
preparations for several "pilot" programs which are not 
comparable, however, to the amounts and goals agreed upon in 
Tokyo: the first five lines of credit for Russian regional 
commercial banks in the amount of $2.5 billion are ready for 
opening. At the same time, energetic efforts to assist the 
program have been undertaken by the Russian side. Thus, within a 
short time frame, the Bank for Entrepreneurship Development was 
established, the start of operations of which has been planned 
for January of 1994. In addition to the extension of credit to 
small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, the bank will also render 
financial support to the privatization process. 
  In the area of export credits, framework agreements have 
been 
signed with the U.S. Export-Import Bank on the financing of the 
oil and gas sector ($2 billion) and the extension of credit to 
other sectors' enterprises ($2 billion). For the first time, 
credits will be granted by the American side without state 
guarantees. It must also be noted that, under pressure from the 
"Seven" countries for the realization of similar projects, the 
World Bank has granted Russia an exemption from the so-called 
"negative tax," which, in particular, opened up for the gas 
industry the possibility of obtaining direct Italian credit. 
<H8>  The Basic Tasks for 1994 </H8>
  1. Obtaining the second part [tranche] of the system credit. 
  2. Concluding a "stand-by" agreement with the IMF. 
  3. Beginning the practical fulfillment of the programs for 
privatization and the support of small business.

<H5>  5.4. Currency Debts and Credits) </H5>
<H5>  5.4.1. Debt Negotiations </H5>
  In accordance with the government's Decree No 364 of 23 
April 1993 On the Procedure for Continuation of the Work on the 
Restructuring of the Foreign Indebtedness of the Former USSR and 
Decree No 732 of 30 July 1993 On the Authority of the Russian 
Federation Delegation in Negotiations with the London Club of 
Creditor Banks on the Restructuring of the Foreign Debt of the 
Former USSR, negotiations are being conducted with the official 
creditor members of the Paris club and the negotiations with the 
commercial creditor banks of the former USSR (the London club) 
have also been resumed. 
  At the same time, negotiations are being held on the terms 
of 
an agreement which correspond to the basic agreement of 2 April 
1993 for the "Paris Club" signed between the Russian Government 
and the official creditor nations, which provide for a 5-year 
grace period and a repayment period for the deferred payments 
over the course of 5 years. The uniqueness of the agreement with 
the Paris club lies in the fact that it is not just the payments 
to pay off the basic debt which have been restructured, but also 
the payments for part of the interest payments. 
  At the present time, negotiations have been conducted with 
all 18 of the club's member countries. Complete agreement has 
been reached on 14 agreements (of these, 8 have been signed, 
Ireland has received the payment due in 1993 and the rest are 
ready for signing). There are disagreements on key questions 
with two countries -- Finland and Italy. With respect to the 
remaining two countries (Canada and Holland), agreement has been 
reached on drafts of bilateral agreements in their basic 
features and all that remains is to reach a final agreement in 
due time. 
  Such a lengthy time for concluding the negotiations is 
necessary, inasmuch as the discussion and signing of a bilateral 
agreement should be preceded by work carried out by the Foreign 
Economic Activity Bank and the corresponding partner overseas 
and the signing of a corresponding protocol. In addition, the 
necessity of observing the principle of an equal attitude toward 
all creditors makes it impossible to agree with the demands put 
forward by Italy and Finland, inasmuch as this contradicts 
Russia's interests and it will also complicate the negotiation 
coming up in 1994 with the Paris club about granting a deferment 
for the payments due during this year. 
  All this made it possible to reduce substantially the burden 
on Russia's budget in the past year, inasmuch as the total 
amount of the payments to pay off the foreign debt came to 
around $2.5 billion, instead of $18 billion, as it would have 
been in the absence of an agreement on restructuring. This 
amount inherently includes the payments to all creditors of the 
former USSR and Russia. At the same time, the agreement with the 
Paris club obliges Russia to be guided firmly by similar 
conditions for debt repayment in the negotiations not only with 
its participants, but also with all the remaining creditors. 
  Similar work will be carried out in 1994 as well, inasmuch 
as 
the payments due in this year for repayment of the former USSR's 
debt exceed not only our capabilities, but also the similar data 
for the current year. 
  Negotiations have been held with the Bank Advisory Commitee 
of the London club of commercial banks (600). In the summer, an 
agreement was concluded on the payment of part of the interest 
for 1992 and 1993 in the amount of $500 million, as well as on 
the necessity of concluding a basic agreement on the 
restructuring of the former USSR's debt through long-term bank 
credits. Almost all of its conditions have been agreed upon 
except for the relinquishing of sovereign immunity and Central 
Bank guarantees for the payments. Russia cannot accept this 
condition legally or politically. 
<H5>  5.4.2. Attracting New Credits </H5>
  In January of 1993, the government's Monetary and Economic 
Commission approved the Ministry of Economics' proposals about 
strategic importing for 1993 in the amount of $8.8 billion, 
including $6.4 billion for credits and $2.4 billion in cash 
($0.6 billion for debt repayment). During this period (1992), 
Russia's policy for foreign borrowing was formed on the basis of 
the needs of enterprises and sectors for importing without real 
consideration of the country's payment capabilities. As a 
result, the problems of the budget stabilization and the foreign 
debt burden worsened. In order to reduce the borrowing amounts, 
at the request of the Ministry of Finance, with consideration of 
the actual capabilities, in August of 1993 the amount of foreign 
credits for the purpose of strategic importing in the second 
half of the year was reduced significantly. 
  The actual use of foreign credits in 1993 amounted to $4.2 
billion, including $2 billion for financing the importing of 
medicines, grain, foodstuffs and raw materials; and $2.2 billion 
for financing purchases of investment commodities. Thus, the 
amount of the increase in Russia's foreign debt was successfully 
reduced by $2.2 billion. Russia's creditors in 1993 were: 
  USA -- $370 million; 
  Germany -- $2,465 million; 
  Japan -- $150 million; 
  France -- $680 million; 
  Italy -- $230 million; 
  Canada -- $60 million; 
  Turkey -- $45 million; 
  ECC -- $200 million. 
  The problem of the state's mutual relations with Russian 
enterprises as a consequence of their significant indebtedness 
to the federal budget for the foreign credits used is currently 
acute. The negative consequences of the decisions made in 1992 
and at the beginning of 1993, when purchases of equipment for a 
number of enterprises were included in the government-guaranteed 
credit lines without analysis of the enterprises' financial 
capabilities on the basis of promises to pay for the credit 
independently, are becoming apparent. As a result, after the 
government's obligations became effective, the enterprises 
announced their inability to pay off the credits, demanded state 
subsidies or requested a full write-off of the indebtedness to 
the budget. 
  In order to regulate the work associated with attracting and 
using foreign credits, on 16 October 1993 the Russian Government 
adopted Decree No 1060, in accordance with which the entire set 
of questions on the preparation of drafts of government 
decisions on foreign borrowing has been entrusted to the 
Ministry of Finance. In this connection, the basic principles of 
the country's credit policy will be: 
  1. The establishment of annual maximum amounts for foreign 
borrowing as a firm limitation for attracting and using foreign 
credits and issuing guarantees. After the approval by the 
Federal Assembly of the maximum amounts of state foreign 
borrowing, the Ministry of Finance will draft and submit for the 
government's approval a detailed borrowing program. 
  2. The regulation of the practice of attracting credits by 
administrative organs of various levels, as well as by 
enterprises which are state property. 
  3. Orientation toward unrestricted financial credits, mainly 
credits from international financial organizations, for the 
purpose of maintaining the country's balance of payments, the 
establishment of currency reserves and the funding of the 
federal budget's deficit. 
  4. A strict approach to the formation of a list of 
enterprises included in credit lines, based on an analysis of 
their financial conditions, efficiency in the use of loan funds 
and independent implementation of payments for credit, as well 
as the granting of security notes (for example, the pledging of 
assets in favor of the state). Subsequently, it will be 
necessary to shift to the practice of project financing, which 
makes no provision for state payment pledges. 
  5. The abandonment of the practice of subsidizing imported 
goods and short-term credits. 
  6. Restricting the issuing of government guarantees to 
individual Russian borrowers who accept foreign credits outside 
of intergovernmental agreements. Guarantees will be granted only 
if the borrower has reliable sources for repaying the credit. 
  Solving these matters will make it possible to ensure 
optimum 
and efficient use of credit resources with consideration of the 
economy's development priorities and will promote the balancing 
of foreign relations and the normalization of the country's 
currency situation. 
<H5>  5.4.3. Servicing the Foreign Debt in 1994 </H5>
  At the end of 1993, Russia's foreign debt, including the 
former USSR's debt, amounted to more than $80 billion (without 
taking into account the indebtedness for settlements with the 
former CEMA countries). In connection with the lack of 
capability to carry out fully the payments for paying off the 
debt in 1992-1993, these amounts are subject to restructuring by 
the creditors in accordance with the achieved or outlined 
understandings. At the present time, the negotiations with the 
Paris club on restructuring the debt for 1994 have not yet been 
completed and Russia has received a 3-month deferment for the 
first quarter on the 1993 terms. 
  In 1994, the payments for paying off the foreign debt should 
amount to $28 billion. In order to reduce these payments, it is 
necessary to reach an agreement with the creditors on a new 
restructuring, which will lead to an increase in the amount of 
the payments for servicing the debt in 1995. In order to avoid a 
geometrical increase in the payments for servicing the debt in 
1994's budget, it is necessary to provide for expenditures for 
servicing the overdue debt in amounts appreciably larger than in 
1993, as well as funds for the full servicing of the new Russian 
debt of 1992-1993. 
  In the draft of 1994's budget, provision is being made for 
payments for servicing the foreign debt in the amount of $6.4 
billion, including: 
  1) $3.8 billion for the former USSR's debts (taking into 
account the restructuring for the payments for 1992, 1993 and 
1994); 
  2) and for Russia's debts (1992-1993) in the amount of $2.6 
billion. 
  This sum is 2.5 times greater than the sum payed in 1993 and 
this fact presupposes a strict limitation on the volumes and 
conditions for new borrowing. 
  Part of industry, as well as the social sphere, as before, 
need to import medicines and certain types of raw materials not 
produced in Russia and the CIS countries. In principle, the 
financing of these transactions should be carried out without 
state participation. However, during the transition period, 
Russian enterprises are unable to attract foreign credits 
without government guarantees. The government is being compelled 
to do this in minimal amounts, but to preserve the practice of 
special-purpose foreign loans. In order to do this, it is 
necessary to reach an agreement with creditors about conditions 
for obtaining credit, which do not exert noticeable influence on 
the level of servicing of the foreign debt for the next 2 years. 
  In order to fund the budget deficit, as well as to finance 
import purchases of equipment, medicines and certain types of 
raw materials, provision is being made in the budget draft for 
attracting financial resources through foreign sources in the 
amount of $6.3 billion, including $2.5 billion in unrestricted 
financial credits from international financial organizations; 
and $3.8 billion in restricted export credits (of those, $1 
billion are restricted credits from international financial 
organizations). 
  No provision is being made in the 1994 budget draft for 
financing import purchases of grain and foodstuffs using foreign 
credits. 
<H5>  5.4.4. Granting Credits </H5>
  For many years, the USSR was the largest creditor of many 
developing and former socialist countries. Credits were granted 
basically in the form of deliveries of equipment, construction 
services and otherwise in rubles. On 1 December 1993, credits 
worth R147.8 billion or $254.8 billion were granted. The actual 
indebtedness of these countries amounts to R93.2 billion ($160.7 
billion), including overdue indebtedness of R30.2 billion ($52 
billion). In accordance with agreements, the repayment of the 
indebtedness is supposed to be carried out in the amount of $6-7 
billion per year. 
  However, the repayment amounts are decreasing from year to 
year, delays have increased, problems have arisen with respect 
to the ruble's exchange rate and Russia's lawful succession and 
the payment structure is deteriorating. In a number of 
instances, it is necessary to agree to repayment of the debts at 
a discount from their nominal amount. 
  In 1993, the account for repayment of foreign states' debt 
received $138.2 million in cash and $200 million in commodity 
shipments, the ruble equivalent of which amounted to R47.4 
billion. The sale of the commodities was conducted by Russian 
importers using the different import factors established by the 
Ministry of Finance in relation to the competitiveness and 
quality of the goods. Part of the shipments went for 1994 in 
connection with the development of a new system for calculating 
the ruble equivalent of these shipments. 
  The payment of funds into the budget as repayment of 
indebtedness by debtor nations will remain, as before, 
insignificant and is estimated for 1994 to be in the amount of 
$1.55 billion, including $0.11 billion in cash and $1.44 billion 
in goods and services. 
  In accordance with intergovernmental agreements, Russia is 
continuing to grant state credits to a number of developing 
countries, basically, India, Cuba, Algeria and Guinea. Provision 
has been made for these expenditures in the 1994 budget in the 
amount of R1.0 trillion. 
  In April of 1993, the granting of "technical" credits to CIS 
member states, the total amount of which came to R2.407 
trillion, was stopped. As of May of 1993, the granting of 
credits to the CIS states is being done through the budget on 
the basis of intergovernmental agreements. In all, based on the 
agreements reached, the amount of these credits was supposed to 
come to R895 billion, while R503 billion were actually granted. 
<H5>  5.4.5. The Domestic Currency Debt </H5>
  The use of currency funds paid into the USSR Foreign 
Economic Activity Bank up to 31 December 1991 was halted by 
Decision No 2172-1 of 13 January 1992 of the Presidium of the 
Supreme Soviet of Russia On the USSR Foreign Economic Activity 
Bank. These funds were used for payments on the foreign debt and 
the payment of centralized importing of raw materials, 
materials, foodstuffs, medicines and consumer goods for all the 
former USSR's republics. 
  At the same time, Russia acknowledged lawful succession for 
the USSR's obligations to Russia's natural and legal persons for 
the accounts in the Foreign Economic Activity Bank. Adopted in 
order to fulfill the obligations was Presidential Edict No 1565 
of 7 December 1992 on Measures for the Regulation of the Former 
USSR's Domestic Currency Debt, which stipulated: 
  -- the re-registration of the USSR's obligations to Russian 
enterprises, organizations, institutions and banks for their 
accounts in the Foreign Economic Activity Bank as bonds in 
foreign currency; 
  -- the repayment of the Foreign Economic Activity Bank's 
indebtedness to natural persons as of 1 July 1993 on their first 
demand (in 1993, the Ministry of Finance allocated $240.2 
million to the Foreign Economic Activity Bank for this purpose); 
  -- the priority (over the course of the first year) 
repayment 
of bonds issued by the charitable fund for the full amount of 
the frozen assets in accounts in the Foreign Economic Activity 
Bank; 
  -- and the repayment of the domestic currency debt to other 
Russian legal persons which have accounts in the Foreign 
Economic Activity Bank during a period of 1-15 years, proceeding 
on the basis of the priorities specified by the edict. 
  The procedure and terms for issuing a domestic state 
currency 
bond loan and the time frames for issuing bonds to legal persons 
which have accounts in the Foreign Economic Activity Bank have 
been approved by the government's Decree No 222 of 15 March 1993 
On the Approval of the Terms for Issuing a Domestic State 
Currency Bond Loan. In conformity with it, the Ministry of 
Finance has issued bonds with face values of U.S. $1,000, 
$10,000 and $100,000 for a total amount of $7.885 billion. 
Provision has been made for the payment of an annual interest of 
3 percent on the bonds. The repayment time frames are 1, 3, 6, 
10 and 15 years in accordance with the bond terms specified by 
the presidential edict. The bonds can be sold publicly at market 
value for freely convertible currency or rubles. 
  In order to ensure repayment of the bonds, the Ministry of 
Finance will make provision annually in the federal budget for 
the appropriate amounts subject to payment to bond holders. In 
order to repay the first part on 14 May 1994, in 1993, the 
Ministry of Finance set aside $330 million in deposit accounts 
(the total amount of the payments, including interest, comes to 
around $500 million). 
<H5>  5.4.6. Foreign Investments in Russia </H5>
  The year 1993 did not produce a noticeable enlivening of 
foreign investors' activities in Russia. Caution and a 
wait-and-see attitude remained typical features. Investments 
were basically directed toward projects not requiring large 
expenditures and with a fast payback. The investment amounts 
also remained modest -- their total amount at the end of 1993 
was estimated to be $2 billion. 
  Russia continued to attract foreign investors mainly by 
natural advantages: a capacious domestic market, abundant 
reserves of natural resources, a relatively skilled and cheap 
labor force, a developed scientific and technical potential and 
opportunities for entry into the CIS countries' markets, which 
creates the objective prerequisites for the profitable 
investment of capital. 
  Joint ventures remained the basic form of foreign 
investments. In 1993, 5,400 joint companies were registered (as 
against 4,500 in 1992) and their overall number exceeded 11,700. 
At the same time, the number of enterprises wholly owned by a 
foreign investor increased. The share of the latter in the total 
number of enterprises with foreign participation reached nearly 
40 percent (as against 19 percent in 1992). The declared charter 
capital of the companies formed in 1993 amounted to R1,327.6 
billion and the scope of foreign participation was R725.1 
billion ($670 million). It must be taken into account that the 
discussion is only about the partners' intentions. In practice, 
during the initial period of activity, 10-15 percent of the 
announced amount is usually invested. 
  The main stream of investments into Russia continued to come 
from the countries of the West (more than 90 percent of all 
investments). The USA remained the largest investor. The share 
of partners from the former CEMA came to around 5 percent and, 
for developing states, it was less than 4 percent of the total 
amount of invested capital. A distinctive feature of the past 
year was the increase in investments made by China's commercial 
trade companies in the development of the sphere of services and 
light industry of the Far East. Based on the number of newly 
established enterprises with 100-percent foreign participation, 
China occupied the leading position in 1993. 
  For the majority of enterprises with foreign participation, 
the diversification of operations was typical, which testifies 
to the investors' uncertainty about the prospects of the 
situation in Russia. Despite the opinion that foreign capital is 
rushing mainly into the sphere of services, nearly half of the 
companies tried to set up production activities. Investments 
were directed primarily into the production of consumer goods 
(clothing, footwear, food, durable goods and building materials) 
and the raw materials sectors (especially oil and gas 
production). 
  In the sphere of services, foreign capital accumulated in 
those sectors whose development determines the condition of the 
market infrastructure: information science, communications and 
telecommunications, personnel training, consultation and 
auditing services and advertising. Western investors have 
displayed a growing interest in the operation of the banking 
business, the insurance business and real estate marketing. 
  The foreign investments are still playing a minor role in 
Russia's economy. In 1993, the share of enterprises with foreign 
capital in the overall total of industrial production did not 
exceed 2.5 percent, in the total number of employed people -- 
0.2 percent, in exporting -- 4 percent and in importing -- 6 
percent. 
  A perceptible effect from the influx of foreign capital may 
be noticeable only with the arrival of large strategic 
investors. Currently, however, there are no legal conditions and 
no mechanism for attracting foreign investments adequate for the 
needs of the economy's reorganization period. Western capital is 
not ready for large-scale investing in Russia. Its activities 
are limited to the realization of small projects not associated 
with the introduction of the latest technologies and not 
requiring significant expenditures, but which make it possible 
to maintain a presence in Russia. 
<H8>  The Basic Tasks for 1994 </H8>
  1. The conclusion of a long-term agreement with the Paris 
and London clubs on debt restructuring. 
  2. Payments on debts in 1994 at a level which will make it 
possible to shift to regulation of the indebtedness for the 
basic amounts of the overdue credits. 
  3. The complete fulfillment of the domestic currency debt 
obligations. 
<H5>  6. Russia's Financial System </H5>
  Russia's financial system includes the set of state and 
non-state specialized institutions which carry out various types 
of financial, credit, monetary, insurance and currency 
transactions, offer auditing services, provide consultations on 
the entire range of financial and economic matters and regulate 
the financial sphere. 
  State regulation of the financial and credit spheres is 
represented, first of all, by the RF Ministry of Finance and the 
RF Central Bank (not examined here). 
  Other state organs which are part of the financial system 
include the State Tax Service, the Tax Investigation Department, 
the Federal Service for Currency and Export Control, the Federal 
Service for Oversight of Insurance Activities, the State Customs 
Committee, and the Committee on Precious Metals and Precious 
Stones. 
  Prior to the reorganization at the end of 1993, the 
Committee 
on Price Policy and the State Inspectorate for the State 
Monopoly on Alcoholic Products also existed. 
  In order to coordinate the activities of the various organs 
of state management in the area of finances and credit, a number 
of commissions were established, including the Governmental 
Commission on Credit Policy Matters and the presidential 
commissions on securities and auditing activities. 
  Among the commercial organizations which are part of the 
financial system, the following stand out: 
  -- commercial banks (not examined here); 
  -- insurance companies; 
  -- auditing companies. 
<H5>  6.1. The Russian Ministry of Finance </H5>
  The Russian Ministry of Finance has been operating since 
1802 and has undergone reorganization repeatedly, including a 
merger in 1992 with the Ministry of Economics. 
  In 1993, the Ministry of Finance was the government's main 
organ in the area of the financial, tax, credit and currency 
policies, having gotten back for itself a number of functions 
previously in the Ministry of Economics, the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations and other departments. In 1993, the Ministry 
of Finance, for all practical purposes, ceased to be the guiding 
organ for the ministries of finance (19 in all), 
administrations, committees and departments of finance of the 
federation entities. On 1 January 1994, the actual number of 
central staff associates of the Ministry of Finance came to 
1,181 people as against 1.061 at the beginning of 1993. 
Attracting skilled personnel remained the most important problem. 
  The Ministry of Finance's system includes: 
  -- the central staff, the Treasury, the Control and Auditing 
Administration and Goznak [State Bank Notes, Coins and Medals 
Main Administration]. 
  The Treasury was established in 1993 in order to 
carry out the function of the execution of the budget, 
settlement, deposit and other transactions, which the Central 
Bank previously performed. The Treasury, headed up by the 
Federal Treasury Main Administration, which is part of the 
Ministry of Finance's central staff, has been subordinated 
directly to the minister of finance. In essence, the Treasury is 
the Ministry of Finance's domestic bank, with local branches and 
its own settlement system. On 1 January 1994, 59 territorial 
organs with a total force of 8,000 people (it will be 20,000 in 
the future) were established. 
  The Ministry of Finance's Control and Auditing 
Administration has been active since 1923 and has around 
8,000 staff members. This system has also been subordinated 
directly to the minister of finance. There are KRU [Control and 
Auditing Administration] organs in all federation entities, 
cities and rayons. They are funded from the federal budget. The 
Control and Auditing Administration is the sole state financial 
control system, which carries out document inspections at state 
enterprises, organizations and institutions and conducts checks 
on the instructions of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] 
within the framework of the struggle against organized crime. In 
1993, the Control and Auditing Administration conducted more 
than 50,000 document checks and inspections, the economic impact 
of which amounted to around R400 billion. The main problem is 
the lack of a legislative basis for state financial control. 
  In 1993, the following basic changes occurred in the 
structure of the Ministry of Finance's central staff, which 
reflect the change in its functions; 
  -- the establishment of the Macroeconomic Policy Department; 
  -- the conversion of the Budget Execution Administration 
into 
the Federal Treasury Main Administration (actually the central 
staff of the Treasury); 
  -- the conversion of the Balance of Payments and Foreign 
Credits Administration into the Foreign Credits and Foreign Debt 
Department; 
  -- and the establishment of the International Financial 
Organizations Department. 
  In addition, the Ministry of Finance has the following basic 
functional subdivisions: the Budget Department, the Currency 
Department, the Tax Reforms Department, the Securities and 
Financial Market Department, the Credit and Monetary Circulation 
Department, the Bookkeeping Records and Reports [Financial 
Balance Sheet] Methodology Department, sectorial financing 
departments, the Control and Auditing Administration, and the 
Legal Department. 
  There is still quite a large number of sectorial 
subdivisions 
for financing the defense complex, construction and the 
construction industry, transport systems and communications, 
agriculture, light industry and the services sphere, the social 
sphere and science, industry and the state machinery. One of the 
tasks of the improvement of the Ministry of Finance's structure 
lies in the reduction of sectorial subdivisions in favor of 
functional ones, with a gradual transfer of their functions to 
the Budget Department. The Budget Department, in turn, is 
supposed to be integrated in the future with the Treasury. 
  In January through March of 1993, the Russian Minister of 
Finance was V.V. Barchuk and, as of April and up to the end of 
the year, he was B.G. Fedorov, who simultaneously held the post 
of Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers -- the Russian 
Government. 
  In 1993, 12 deputy ministers joined the leadership of the 
Ministry of Finance. The first deputy ministers are A.P. Vavilov 
and S.K. Dubinin (appointed 15 March 1993), The deputy ministers 
are S.V. Aleksashenko (macroeconomics, taxes, bookkeeping 
records; appointed 30 May 1993), A.A. Astakhov (defense 
complex), A.I. Golovatyy (currency problems), A.I. Kazmin 
(credit and monetary circulation and financial markets; 
appointed 1 July 1993), S.A. Korolev (administration), A.A. 
Krasnopivtsev (agro-industrial complex), I.P. Molchanov (the 
social sphere), V.A. Petrov (budget; appointed 7 July 1993), and 
I.A. Selivanov (foreign credits, foreign debt and international 
organizations; appointed 1 July 1993). 
  Over the course of the year, deputy ministers S.B. Gorbachev 
(taxes and credit; 7 July 1993) and P.V. Chernomord (industry; 
30 December 1993) left the Ministry of Finance. 
  From 24 September 1993 through 5 January 1994, A.P. 
Pochinok, 
who was occupied with the takeover of the affairs of the former 
Supreme Soviet, was a deputy minister. Thus, in 1993, six deputy 
ministers were appointed and three were let go. 
<H5>  6.2. Other Financial Organs </H5>
  The year 1993 was marked by the further development of the 
system of state financial organs and, first and foremost, by the 
rapid increase in the forces of the tax service and the tax 
investigation department. 
  It is typical that the actual number of staff members of the 
above-listed departments amounts to around 170,000 as against 
almost 300,000 according to the manning table. This testifies to 
two trends: 
  -- the financial system is just being put together and new 
organs are emerging; in due course, the share of financial 
workers among state personnel will increase substantially; 
  -- and the low wages and the political instability are 
leading to the rapid exodus of personnel into commercial 
structures.

1. Including the financial organs of federation entities 

2. For 9 months 

3. The Tax Investigations Administration prior to the adoption of the law on 
the Tax Investigation Department 


  An important unresolved problem of the financial system is 
the artificial splitting of state organs, which leads to a lack 
of coordination, of a unified financial policy and of unified 
state financial control. The separation of the "revenuers" (the 
tax service, customs and the RF Committee on Precious Metals and 
Precious Stones) and the control organs (the tax investigation 
department, currency and export control and insurance oversight) 
cannot lead to anything good. Moreover, with the transfer of the 
Committee on Foreign Investments to RAMSiR [Russian Agency for 
International Cooperation and Development], one more important 
facet of the financial policy was lost. 
  Over the course of the year, attempts were made to push the 
Ministry of Finance away from the problems of the foreign debt, 
the credit policy and international organizations. In this 
connection, the Ministry of Finance repeatedly submitted 
corresponding proposals to the government and de facto expanded 
its authority. Nevertheless, without serious changes in the 
government's structure and in the functions of such key 
departments as the Ministry of Finance, it is impossible to 
count on a rapid increase in the effectiveness of the country's 
financial policy. 
<H5>  6.3. The Development of Auditing Activities </H5>
  Auditing activities developed relatively quickly in 1993. 
The first auditing firm, Inaudit, appeared back in 1987. At the 
present time, there are more than 2,000 firms which offer 
auditing and related consultation services in almost all of 
Russia's large and medium-sized cities. In the absence of a law 
on auditing, they have been established and registered as 
ordinary enterprises. In Moscow and St. Petersburg, branches 
have been opened by the largest international auditing firms, 
Arthur Andersen, Coopers and Lybrand, Deloitte and Touche, Ernst 
and Young, Price Waterhouse, and others. 
  On 22 December 1993, a presidential edict On Auditing 
Activities in the Russian Federation was issued, in accordance 
with which the Presidential Commission on Auditing Activities 
has been established. This commission will handle the procedure 
for certification and licensing for auditing activities and 
determine the range of economic entities for which an annual 
auditing check is obligatory (currently, this applies to joint 
ventures, banks, insurance companies and investment funds). 
<H5>  6.4. The Insurance Business </H5>
  In 1993, the rapid development of insurance was observed: 
insurance payments increased from R79.1 billion to approximately 
R1 trillion (as against R13.2 billion in 1991). At the end of 
1993, there were more than 2,000 insurance companies, in which 
around 200,000 people were working, while their number exceeded 
2,000 at the end of the year. At the same time, the pace of 
registration of new companies is not decreasing, but only 2 
percent of all the companies have internal assets of more than 
R100 million, while 70 percent have less than R6 million, which 
indicates the sector's weakness. Because of the restriction of 
the foreign partner's share to 49 percent of the capital, up to 
now, 25 companies with foreign participation have been 
registered and they are not playing a noticeable role. 
  A typical trend is the constant increase in the share of 
non-state companies in the total amount of payments, which came 
to 16 percent in 1991, 57 percent in 1992 and 67 percent for the 
first 9 months of 1993. Of the total amount of insurance 
payments, 35 percent is going for voluntary personal insurance, 
34 percent for voluntary property insurance, 24 percent for 
voluntary liability insurance and 7 percent for compulsory types 
of insurance. 
  The lack of a clear legislative basis and the insurance 
companies' weak financial condition are holding back the 
insurance sector's development, many types of insurance are 
completely lacking and there is no understanding of the benefits 
of insurance under the conditions of a market economy. The task 
for 1994 is a more active expansion of the insurance services 
market and the introduction of insurance into a larger number of 
spheres of life. 
<H5>  7. A Glance into the Future; the Prospects for 1994 </H5>
  As 1993 ended and 1994 began, the Ministry of Finance 
examined several alternative versions of financial and economic 
policies for 1994, which reflect the substantial gamut of 
opinion in this area. The socio-economic consequences of these 
alternative versions were also calculated. 
  The first of the examined versions assumes the abandonment 
of 
the widespread idea that the problems of structural 
reorganization can be solved through emissions, especially when 
conditions have not been created for efficient use of the 
financial resources in the real world. Therefore, in the first 
stage, it is necessary to solve precisely these problems. The 
attainment of efficiency in the use of financial resources in 
the economy, first of all, is associated with progress in two 
directions: the institutional transformations and the 
acquisition by money of real value through supporting favorable 
interest rates for credits to the economy, abandoning the 
widespread use of gratis emission and, as a consequence, 
bringing inflation to a low level. 
  According to the first version, it would be advisable to 
gradually reduce the Central Bank's credit emission in relation 
to the GDP further by a factor of approximately 3 in comparison 
with 1993, bringing it down to 5 percent of the GDP in the 
fourth quarter of this year. In this instance, an average 
monthly inflation of around 5-6 percent would be achieved as 
early as summer. The ruble's exchange rate relative to the 
dollar in the year's second half would amount to R2,000- 2,500 
to the dollar. The decrease in the GDP in real terms over the 
course of the first quarter would be quite considerable (in 
essence, this has already been "programmed' by the economy's 
sluggishness), however, in the subsequent period, it would be 
possible to count on the stabilization of its amounts in real 
terms. On the whole over the year, the GDP's volume would 
decrease by 8-10 percent (December to December). The people's 
actual incomes, after a slight drop in the first quarter, over 
the year as a whole, might increase by another 10 percent, i.e., 
approximately the same as for 1993. 
  The second version calculated by the Ministry of Finance 
assumed that the government would continue the emission support 
of production, but that it would use this mechanism moderately. 
The Central Bank's credit emission in this version would amount 
to 9-10 percent of the GDP in the year's first half and would 
decrease by a factor of 1.5 by year's end. This would make it 
possible to fix the average monthly inflation level achieved by 
year's end at 11-12 percent and to maintain a favorable 
refinancing interest rate. The drop in the GDP would also 
continue over the year as a whole and would amount to around 7-9 
percent. The people's actual incomes would remain at 1993's 
level. The ruble's exchange rate would increase more slowly than 
inflation and would amount to R4,500-5,000 to the dollar by 
year's end. Within the framework of this version, just as in the 
preceding one, the possibility of constructive cooperation with 
international financial organizations and of obtaining real 
financial aid and assistance in the restructuring of the foreign 
debt would be preserved. 
  The next version reflects the situation which actually 
emerged by the end of January of 1994: a recoil from the 
moderately harsh monetary policy which was pursued in 1993. 
There would be an increase in the emission covering of the 
government deficit, just as there would be for the Central 
Bank's credit emission as a whole, the institution of 
preferential credits would be introduced anew, along with the 
deferment of payments and the write-off of the Agro-Industrial 
Complex's debts. 
  During the quantitative assessment of this version's 
variables, the ministry proceeded on the basis of the fact that 
the presidential edict on the republic budget's maximum deficit 
which can be funded through Central Bank credit would set the 
limit for monetary expansion in the first quarter at R7.5 
trillion. Increasing this figure would require going to the Duma 
and a lengthy procedure for discussion of the 1994 budget. 
Therefore, it is most likely that expansion of the credit 
emission can proceed only through an increase in Central Bank 
credits to the economy (seasonal work in agriculture, shipments 
to the Far North and assistance to the Fuel and Energy Complex) 
and the drawing of its profits into the budget. In addition, 
decisions are being prepared at the present time on the payment 
of a number of the budget's "production" debts for 1993 
financing (basically, for the Ministry of Defense, agriculture 
and grain). This indebtedness arose as a result of the adoption 
of numerous government decisions which contradicted the 
presidential edict on a moratorium on increasing budget 
expenditures and the presidential edict on the RF budget for the 
fourth quarter of 1993 and which led to an unplanned increase in 
budget expenditures. The Ministry of Finance repeatedly went to 
the government with an initiative about revoking these 
decisions. However, not a single decision has been revoked. 
  The payment of the "production" debts within the limits of 
the anticipated tax revenues in the first quarter and the 
maximum deficit approved by the presidential edict is possible 
only through the abolition of the wage indexing in the 
budget-controlled sphere. Thus, the inflation mechanism will 
operate in the following manner. The intensification of the 
Central Bank's credit emission in favor of the production sector 
and the "production" reorientation of budget spending will 
result in a rapid deterioration of the situation in the 
budget-controlled sphere. This will require not talking about 
but actually carrying out the indexing in the second quarter of 
the budget-controlled workers' incomes. A sharp increase in 
inflation in the spring will require a sharp intensification of 
the financial assistance to agriculture, the Fuel and Energy 
Complex and so on. A sharp increase in grain prices will 
intensify the subsidy pressure on the budget. It is necessary to 
add to this the fact that, by the beginning of 1994, the 
domestic sources for increasing the currency supply in the 
currency market had been depleted. This means that, with a mild 
monetary policy, the danger of a synchronous or anticipatory 
increase in the dollar's exchange rate in comparison with 
inflation becomes real, as does the intensification of the 
flight from the ruble to foreign funds. In this situation, the 
"exchange-rate" pressure on the rate of inflation will increase 
sharply, the rate of turnover will shoot upward catastrophically 
and monetary control over inflation will be lost. In order to 
pursue the policy of support for production and to maintain 
balance on the brink of the survival of the budget-controlled 
sphere, the credit emission by at least the middle of the year 
should amount to 25-30 percent of the GDP. This is a moderately 
realistic assessment of the actions of the "Red Economic 
Managers." (In 1993, the Ukrainian Government carried out an 
emission in the amount of half of the GDP.) Thus, by 1994's 
third quarter, Russia might really find itself on the threshold 
of "Ukrainization" of the economy. The adverse processes in the 
financial sphere will be aggravated by an exodus of capital and 
a sharp drop in the ruble's exchange rate. An alternative to 
this process will be the reduction of emission at the end of the 
third quarter. While the current government will be able to 
carry this out, the sharp intensification of the production 
slump and the reduction in real wages will be a high price to 
pay for the inconsistency displayed at the beginning of the year. 
  An attempt to replace the monetary methods of control over 
inflation with non-monetary ones (price restrictions, the 
introduction of the 100-percent sale of currency earnings, a 
currency exchange rate for the ruble set by the Central Bank of 
Russia, obligatory deliveries and so on) will mean in the final 
tally a gradual turning aside not only from the economic 
reforms, but also from the political reforms and the course 
toward the democratization of society. Society is currently 
standing on the threshold of the most crucial decision since the 
start of the reforms in 1992. 
  Not examined in the Ministry of Finance's calculations was 
the version of non-monetary methods for limiting inflation, 
which must be understood as attempts to limit prices. The 
limiting of prices effectively is possible only in the raw 
materials and single-product industries. Attempts to do this 
will either cause the progressive ravaging of the fuel complex 
or will require enormous subsidies which will quickly destroy 
the state's financial system. Attempts to limit prices in the 
consumer sphere are currently simply impossible.

<H5>  Declaration on the Economic Policy of the Government and the </H5>
Central Bank of Russia 
  Tasks: 
  The goal of the tax and monetary policies of the government 
and the Central Bank is the reduction of the monthly rate of 
inflation to a level below 10 percent by the end of 1993 and the 
attainment in 1994 of a further stabilization of prices. The 
policy's goals in other areas, including foreign trade, the 
currency exchange rate system and privatization are increasing 
the efficiency of Russia's economy, acclerating its integration 
into the world economy and strengthening the market's role with 
consideration of the state's federal structure. The quantitative 
description of the economic policy measures contained in this 
declaration is given in the Technical Supplement. 
  1. Monetary and Credit Policy 
  a. Beginning as of 1993's second quarter, the overall 
increase in Central Bank of Russia (TsBR) credits shall be 
confined to the quarterly limits, which shall be determined 
proceeding on the basis of the tasks for reducing inflation. 
  b. Granting special-purpose subsidized credits by both the 
government and the Central Bank of Russia shall conform to the 
aforementioned credit guidelines. All applications for 
special-purpose bank credits shall be reviewed by the Commission 
on Credit Policy. 
  c. The Russian Government and the Central Bank of Russia 
shall gradually abandon the granting of all types of 
special-purpose credits through the Central Bank and shall shift 
to granting subsidies only through the budget, being guided by 
market mechanisms during the conducting of the monetary policy. 
In order to attain this goal, the Central Bank of Russia shall 
substantially increase the share of credits which it grants to 
commercial banks either through credit auctions or on market 
terms. The Central Bank of Russia shall refrain from 
distributing special-purpose credits on a sectorial or regional 
basis and also from granting credits directly to specific 
enterprises. By 15 July 1993, the Central Bank of Russia's prime 
rate shall be set at a level no more than 7 percentage points 
below the interbank basic market interest rate as indicated in 
the Technical Supplement and it shall then be maintained at this 
level. Henceforth, the interest rates shall be subsidized only 
through the budget in accordance with the established limits. 
  d. The government and the Central Bank of Russia shall not 
subsequently carry out the extension of credit for the mutual 
crediting of enterprises' non-payments. Measures shall be taken 
for the introduction of progressive settlements in the economy. 
  2. The Budget Policy 
  a. The overall budget deficit (i.e., the deficit of the 
consolidated budget plus the non-budget import subsidies) shall 
be limited by the quarterly guidelines which conform to the 
above-listed program in the area of credit. The government's 
borrowing of the banking system's funds, including the Central 
Bank of Russia's funds, shall be restricted with due 
consideration of foreign financing and the emission of state 
securities to be sold in the market. 
  b. The government shall implement the necessary measures on 
spending and revenue items in order to comply with the indicated 
restrictions on the overall budget deficit and the limit on 
obtaining bank credits. These measures shall be aimed at 
reducing tax breaks and subsidies, in particular, import 
subsidies and subsidized special-purpose credits, as well as at 
proportionally reducing the expenditures for budget items. 
Obtaining additional revenues from the tax on energy resources 
shall be planned. 
  3. Policy in the Area of Currency Exchange Rates and 
International Reserves 
  a. The government considers the establishment of a system 
for 
a unified market exchange rate for the ruble to be a key element 
of the transition to a market economy. Although the strategic 
task is the transition to a stable exchange rate, the ruble's 
exchange rate shall continue to float with respect to other 
currencies until the financial policy has been strengthened and 
inflation has been lowered substantially. Until then, the 
Central Bank of Russia shall not conduct interventions in the 
currency market for the purpose of artificially supporting the 
ruble's exchange rate. The government shall exert efforts for 
replenishing Russia's currency reserves. 
  b. The access of non-residents to the currency markets in 
Russia shall be expanded. As of 15 July 1993, non-residents 
shall be able to sell foreign currency and, as of 1 September, 
shall be able to buy foreign currency. 
  c. The Central Bank of Russia intends to encourage the 
currency market's further development, including by supporting 
regional currency exchanges and the transition to daily quoting 
of the currency exchange rate. 
  4. Foreign Trade Policy 
  The government shall undertake further steps aimed at the 
liberalization of foreign trade. Export quotas for various 
products shall be gradually eliminated in accordance with a 
specific schedule. The plan for centralized exporting shall not 
be expanded in 1993, while, in 1994, the volumes of centralized 
exporting shall be reduced to one-third of 1993's level. The 
government shall not introduce the practice of multiple currency 
exchange rates nor conclude bilateral payment agreements which 
would contradict Article 8 of the Articles of the IMF Agreement 
nor impose import restrictions for the purpose of supporting the 
balance of payments. 
  5. Basic Structural Changes 
  The government intends to implement consistently the 
privatization program and to improve the legal basis for market 
relations, to further the development of the financial markets 
and to promote actively structural changes in the economy. The 
government shall submit to the Supreme Soviet drafts of laws on 
joint-stock companies and securities, as well as a new Civil and 
Commercial Code, which include reinforcement of the legal 
protection of contracts; it shall strive for the removal of 
restrictions with respect to land ownership; and it shall ensure 
the implementation of the law on bankruptcies. 
  6. Economic Cooperation with Countries of the Former USSR 
  a. The government and the Central Bank of Russia acknowledge 
the longing of the states which were part of the former Soviet 
Union to introduce their own monetary units and are ready to 
cooperate fully with them. The government shall also seek to 
conclude appropriate agreements with those states which express 
a desire to use Russia's monetary unit. 
  b. We shall strive to reach agreements with the countries of 
the former Soviet Union on terms of financing for credits 
granted by Russia in 1992 and the beginning of 1993. We are 
ready to discuss with interested states amounts and methods for 
granting new intergovernmental loans. The credits to the former 
USSR republics shall go through the budget system and be 
formalized as official state credits. 
  c. We intend to work jointly with interested states on 
increasing the efficiency of the mechanism for payments between 
countries of the former Soviet Union, including through the 
establishment of interstate clearing mechanisms. 
  7. Policy Conduct and Monitoring 
  The Russian Government shall make available to the 
International Monetary Fund information necessary for monitoring 
the fulfillment of the program agreed upon with the IMF. In this 
connection and in cooperation with the IMF, the government and 
the Central Bank are developing a set of short-term financial 
and foreign economic indicators. Steps are being undertaken for 
the expansion of the government's capabilities for the 
implementing economic policy, including, in particular, 
strengthening the Commission on Credit Policy's role, adjusting 
the Treasury's operation and the development of interaction with 
non-budget-controlled funds. By 1 September 1993, the government 
shall form a mechanism for the effective monitoring of foreign 
receipts and a system for deriving the ruble equivalent of 
foreign financing and shall establish to this end a group which 
includes IMF representatives. 
  8. The Agreement on Standby Credit 
  The Russian Federation Government intends in the very near 
future to enter into negotiations with the IMF on the conclusion 
of a standby credit agreement. 
  [Signed] V. Chernomyrdin, Chairman of the Council of 
Ministers of the Russian Federation Government; V. Gerashchenko, 
Chairman of the Russian Federation Central Bank (the Bank of 
Russia); 22 May 1993. 
<H5>  Declaration of the Council of Ministers of the Russian </H5>
Federation Government on the Economic Policy at the End of 1993 
and in 1994 
  The government declares its firm intention to strive for 
the improvement and advancement of the Russian economy. The most 
urgent measures shall be aimed at lowering inflation, 
stabilizing production, increasing investments and accelerating 
structural transformations. The main task shall be lowering 
inflation to 15 percent in January and to 3-5 percent in 
December of 1994 as a necessary condition for stimulating 
investments and production. To this end, the government shall 
actively interact with the regions, the Central Bank of Russia 
and the future parliament. 
  1. The Budget Policy 
  a. The federal budget deficit in the fourth quarter of 1993 
shall not exceed R5.5 trillion, including R0.9 trillion due to 
the issuing of state securities in the financial market. 
  b. The Central Bank of Russia's net credits to the budget in 
the fourth quarter shall not exceed R4 trillion. 
  c. In order to reduce the deficit, the government intends to

and the Far North, shall be consolidated in the federal budget. 
  e. in 1994, the federal budget deficit shall be within the

should be covered through the issuing of securities floated on a 
voluntary basis. 
  2. The Monetary Policy 
  In the area of the monetary policy, the government has

interest rate for Central Bank of Russia credits at first and 
then for deposits in banks. 
  d. The Central Bank of Russia's rate shall not be lower than

begin to hold credit auctions and to grant lombard credits to 
banks, secured by securities. 
  f. In 1994, not less than 30 percent of the Central Bank of 
Russia's credits shall be distributed through auctions and 
lombard credits. In 1994, the Central Bank of Russia shall 
abandon the distribution of special-purpose credits through its 
own territorial organs. Any support of regions and sectors shall 
go through the budget. 
  g. The Central Bank of Russia's total extension of credit 
shall be restricted by the quarterly limits established by the

Ministry of Finance shall, each quarter, conclude an agreement 
on the basic variables of the monetary policy. 
  3. Currency Policy 
  a. The Central Bank of Russia shall not conduct currency 
interventions for the purpose of supporting the ruble's exchange 
rate and shall strive to operate in the currency market 
basically for the purpose of smoothing out fluctuations in the 
ruble's exchange rate. 
  b. The economic policy as a whole shall be aimed at the 
consistent increase of the ruble's purchasing power.

curtailed by a factor of at least 3 in comparison with 1993. 
  d. All import subsidies shall be abolished as of 1 January 
1994. 
  e. The government shall avoid increasing import duties. 
  f. Prior to the end of 1993, the restrictions on land 
ownership and the sale of land shall be eliminated. 
  g. In the first quarter of 1994, the restrictions on

creation of conditions for pursuing unified and efficient 
monetary, financial, currency and customs policies. 
  c. It is necessary to develop commodity and currency markets 
which provide for the exchange of the non-cash rubles of other 
countries for Russian rubles at exchange rates which arise under 
the influence of supply and demand. 
  d. During the country's transition period, the signers of 
the 
Agreement on the Establishment of an Economic Union who use 
series 1961-1992 banknotes, series 1993 banknotes and other 
means of payment, which circulate only on their territory, may 
introduce their own currencies.

Ministers of the Russian Federation Government; 5 November 1993. 
<H5>  Draft of the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation </H5>
  In order to stabilize the Russian ruble's exchange rate, 
to strengthen currency control and to prevent the exodus of 
capital from Russia, I decree that: 
  1. The Russian Federation Government shall: 
  -- prior to 1 April 1993, adopt a decision on a reduction by 
50 percent in the amount of import duties for centralized 
importing, with the intention of eliminating them completely by 
1 September 1993; 
  -- prior to 1 May 1993, re-register all benefits previously 
granted in the foreign economic sphere, with the intention of 
abolishing them completely by 1 July 1993; 
  -- prior to 1 July 1993, conduct negotiations with the 
recipient countries of Russian credits on the official 
registration of previously issued credits as an interstate debt 
and on the terms of and procedure for its servicing; 
  -- prior to 1 April 1993, establish the procedure for the 
granting to all foreign states (including the ruble zone states) 
of credits (including technical credits and cash credits) on the 
basis of intergovernmental agreements; this procedure should 
stipulate the inclusion of interstate credits in the state 
budget and the approval of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet 
of their amounts, directions of use and the conditions of and 
the procedure for servicing; 
  -- prior to 1 April 1993, adopt a decision on the compulsory 
sale of 50 percent of export earning to commercial banks at the 
market exchange rate;

exporting; 
  -- prior to 1 July 1993, adopt measures to stop settlements 
on the territory of the Russian Federation in foreign currency. 
  2. Recommend to the Central Bank of Russia that it should: 
  -- tighten up the monetary policy in accordance with the 
guidelines embedded in the Russian Federation Government's 
program of actions for 1993 and, in particular , it should: 
  -- bring the commercial bank's refinancing rate 
approximately 
to the market level; 
  -- impose rigid quantitative restrictions (limits) on the 
increase in the Bank of Russia's total credit, as well as 
direction limits, including credits to the government, 
commercial banks, enterprises and ruble zone countries; 
  -- jointly with the government, develop a more effective 
mechanism for supporting the ruble's currency exchange rate; 
  -- shift to an official quotation of foreign currencies, 
including the currencies of ruble zone states; the currency 
exchange rates determined on a market basis shall be used for 
transactions with authorized banks; at the same time, regulation 
of the exchange rate should be carried out using the methods of 
the monetary policy.

<H5>  Letter to Russian Federation President B.N. Yeltsin, Russian </H5>
Federation Supreme Soviet Chairman R.I. Khasbulatov and Council 
of Ministers--Russian Federation Government Chairman V.S. 
Chernomyrdin on the Central Bank 
  The most acute problem of the present day messing up 
Russia's economy is inflation. In the situation which has 
arisen, saving, investing and developing production are 
impossible. 
  Over the course of the last 3 months, I have painstakingly 
attempted to convince the Central Bank of Russia and, first and 
foremost, its chairman, V.V. Gerashchenko, of the necessity of 
adopting in a strict manner decisive stabilization measures. 
  Despite dozens of appeals and demands: 
  -- as before, we are not receiving any information about the 
Central Bank's activities and we do not know what is actually 
going on in the credit sphere; 
  -- the Central Bank has still not made a single decision 
within the framework of the program outlined by the government; 
  -- the Central Bank is actively sabotaging the specific 
measures already prepared -- raising interest rates (2.5 months 
of mocking evasions) and issuing treasury bills (planned for the 
end of February); 
  -- the Central Bank is sabotaging all the negotiations with 
the International Monetary Fund and, it is likely, will be the 
main reason for the failure to obtain a program of international 
financial assistance this year. All the world's central banks 
are perplexed by our Central Bank's policy. 
  The inclusion of the Central Bank's chairman in the make-up 
of the government has essentially changed nothing. We cannot 
give the Central Bank instructions of any kind, yet the bank 
does not intend to undertake actions of any kind. The last 
credit commission (22 March 1993) showed clearly that there will 
be no progress. V.V. Gerashchenko vaguely nods his head in 
Staraya Ploshchad, but, upon his return to the bank, he 
unambiguously announces to his associates the fact that nothing 
will be done. 
  Under these conditions, there is no hope for the success of 
our financial and economic policies and international support 
for the reforms during this period, which is so complicated for 
the country, is virtually slipping away. 
  Inasmuch as the matter has crossed into the political plane, 
then, in Russia's national interests, it is necessary to raise 
the question of a change in the leadership of the Central Bank 
in the most decisive manner. Otherwise, we will be continuing to 
pretend that we are carrying out reform. 
  [Signed] B. Fedorov; 23 March 1993. 
<H5>  Letter to Russian President B.N. Yeltsin and Russian </H5>
Government Chairman V.S. Cheronmyrdin, with a Copy to V.V. 
Gerashchenko, on the Financial Problems of 1993 
  1. The Politicization of Financial Decisions 
  The pre-election campaign in 1993 is becoming continuous. 
The 
preparations for the referendum have shown that all the 
political forces are resorting in the pre-election struggle to 
populist measures which are leading to the uncontrolled 
squandering of the Central Bank of Russia's financial resources 
and credits. 
  The adjustment (recalculation) of 1993's budget and the 
drafting of the 1994 budget will be carried out under adverse 
political conditions. The pressure with the demands for an 
increase in spending, for a lowering of taxes and preferential 
credits on the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of 
Russia will increase. It will take on a critical nature in the 
fall, when the elections are announced. 
  It is necessary to try to achieve the leadership's public 
declaration: "The policy of financial stabilization cannot be a 
hostage of the pre-election struggle." 
  2. The Budget Deficit 
  In 1992, the official estimate of the republic budget's 
deficit was around 7 percent of Russia's GDP. The IMF estimates 
that indicator at 22 percent of the GDP. This is associated with 
the consideration of the non-budget-controlled funds and a 
number of preferential investment credits. 
  In 1993, according to the budget approved on 25 March of 
this 
year by the RF Supreme Soviet, the deficit will amount to around 
15 percent of the GDP. With the recalculation of the budget, 
taking inflation into account, it will increase even more. 
However, if the IMF's approach is used and the 
non-budget-controlled funds, as well as the subsidizing of a 
favorable exchange rate for freely convertible currency for 
importing, are taken into consideration, then the republic 
budget's deficit will take on catastrophic proportions in 1993. 
  In April through June, the funding of the budget 
expenditures 
(without taking new ones into account) does not exceed 60 
percent. Our goal, in both the first and second quarters, is to 
keep the deficit at the level of R1.3 trillion (in the first 
quarter, the deficit's cash total amounted to R1.7 trillion in 
connection with the delay in the transfer of revenues in the 
amount of around R400 billion), which will produce a powerful 
stabilizing effect. The main problem comes from the new spending 
decisions (see below). 
  Central Bank of Russia credits will inevitably remain the 
sole source for covering the deficit. The floating of securities 
will produce only insignificant funds. Central Bank of Russia 
credits should be issued only at low interest rates in order to 
reduce emission. 
  3. The Tax Burden 
  The complaints about the tax squeeze are justified. On the 
whole, taxes and obligatory collections amount in 1993 to around 
47 percent of the GDP. However, their actual collection is 
lower, since large-scale tax evasion is going on. However, 
reducing taxes in the face of a budget deficit at the level of 
15-25 percent of the GDP is impossible. 
  The government should not dispense tax breaks. It is also 
impossible to abandon the method of levying taxes in advance. 
  4. Budget Federalism 
  At the present time, a single-channel system has been 
introduced de facto for the collection and transfer of taxes by 
such republics which are part of the Russian Federation as 
Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Chechnya and Yakutia-Sakha. Karelia is 
laying claim to a number of revenues allocated to the republic 
budget (for example, to the collection for the GRR [geological 
prospecting operations]). 
  Judicial allocation of them is intolerable without such a 
right within the framework of any kind of agreement or 
supplement to the Federation Treaty. In the treaty itself, 
financial policy has been relegated to the sphere of the joint 
jurisdiction of the federal center and the republics. 
  Any recognition of the legality of the single-channel system 
will lead to similar demands on the part of the oblasts. A 
number of them (Irkutsk and Perm) are already officially raising 
the question of at least a re-examination of the ratio for the 
distribution of the NDS [VAT] between the federal republic 
budget and the oblast budgets. Currently, this ratio amounts to 
80:20 and they are demanding 50:50. 
  To date, clear criteria for the distribution of revenues and 
expenditures among the various levels' budgets have not been 
worked out. There is also no clear policy of penalties for those 
who do not pay taxes. A firm political decision is necessary. 
  5. Indexing Pensions and Wages 
  The RF Supreme Soviet adopted a decision on increasing the 
minimum pension by a factor of 1.9 as of 1 May 1993. This is in 
keeping with the indexing principle previously adopted in the 
law. The pension minimum will exceed R8,000 per month. 
  Raising the minimum wage is inevitable. Currently, it is 
R4,275 per month. However, the republic budget is unable to fund 
the adopted decisions on increasing wages in the 
budget-controlled sphere as of 1 April 1993 by a factor of 1.9 
without a colossal increase in the deficit. An additional sum of 
around R1.4 trillion will be required just for the Ministry of 
Defense in 1993. Our spending, as a result of the recently 
adopted decisions, will increase as of April of 1993 by R800 
billion per month, which means a financial catastrophe. We will 
not be able to start on the fulfillment of these decisions 
earlier than June of this year. 
  In 1993's third quarter there will be a new increase in the 
pension minimum, apparently, also by a factor of 1.5-2. In 
August of 1993 it will amount to around R15,000. Also inevitable 
is a corresponding increase in wages. The mechanism for the 
long-term strengthening of the incomes -- expenditures -- prices 
inflationary spiral is being engaged at full power. This is 
where the notorious inflation of costs is. 
  In connection with what has been said, it will be necessary 
by May to declare a 6-month moratorium on reviewing the minimum 
pension and the minimum wage. 
  6. The Subsidy Nature of Budget Spending 
  Subsidies in the republic budget are the basic method for 
distributing funds. They are implemented in various forms: 
  -- as compensation for the difference in prices (subsidies 
in 
a pure form), they are aimed at the coal-mining industry and 
agriculture; 
  -- in the form of subsidies of a non-specific nature and 
special-purpose subventions, the funds are transferred to oblast 
budgets and the budgets of the republics which are part of the 
RF; 
  -- a number of sectors and individual enterprises are 
receiving subsidies in the form of preferential exchange rates 
for freely convertible currency during centralized importing; 
  -- subsidies are being granted in the form of compensation 
for part of the interest rate for preferential credit through 
the budget; 
  -- and tax rebates and tax credit (deferment of the payment 
of taxes for 5 years for the Nakhodka zone) are being dispensed 
widely by both decisions of the RF Supreme Soviet and of the 
Council of Ministers -- the RF Government. 
  The reduction of all forms of subsidies is absolutely 
necessary. Preferential credit must be granted only as a measure 
for smoothing out seasonal variations (the shipments to the 
North and the purchases of grain in the form of advance 
payments). It is necessary to summarize the information about 
all the granted credits and to conduct their revision from the 
standpoint of efficiency. The work is labor-intensive and 
affects a mass of interests, but it is necessary. It is 
necessary to attempt to carry it out during the preparing of the 
1994 budget. 
  7. The Mutual Relations with the CIS 
  Entering into an economic union with interested CIS 
countries 
has been officially proclaimed an RF policy. A version of such a 
union made up of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan is being 
considered. 
  The basic components of the union are: 
  -- an agreement on unified monetary and currency policies; 
  -- an agreement on a unified customs policy. 
  In the last government, skepticism prevailed with respect to 
the reality of these kinds of plans. It was believed that the 
euphoria of sovereignty would not allow any of the presidents of 
the former USSR republics to sign a firm agreement on a union 
with the RF. Consequently, it had been possible to talk a lot 
about a union as about the future and to pursue fully an 
independent RF policy. 
  Over the course of 1992, this tactic justified itself. 
Dividing the non-cash money turnover and the introduction (for 
now, just on paper) of a foreign trade procedure for mutual 
deliveries using customs duties were successfully managed. 
  However, at the beginning of 1993, when the RF started the 
final stage of the demarcation (the introduction of the customs 
duties in February of this year and the transition from Central 
Bank of Russia "technical credits" to interstate credits using 
budget funds), Kazakhstan and Belarus realized that living in 
the situation they had established of unclear and unorganized 
quasi-soviet relations would no longer work. 
  They again began actively to put forward the idea of an 
economic union. The RF fell into an unusual situation -- now the 
partners would accept any harsh demands, including the 
subordination of their own central banks to the Central Bank of 
Russia's decisions. Just 2 months ago, they had flatly rejected 
this. 
  The RF leaders also could not officially abandon the 
economic 
union for domestic political reasons. Apparently, there existed 
only one path: the harshest possible conditions for a union -- 
if they reject them, life will go on further in the direction of 
separation; if they accept them, it will be necessary to conduct 
a fierce struggle for the actual realization of these rules. 
  Ukraine and the Central Asian and Transcaucasian states, as 
well as the Baltic States, will remain outside this economic 
union. This situation eases the RF's tasks somewhat. 
  8. Fixing Petroleum Product Prices 
  The two edicts aimed at fixing the prices for gasoline and 
diesel fuel at the level of the price on 1 March of this year 
are part of a more general approach, according to which the 
increase in prices in Russia is associated basically with the 
increase in the cost of energy resources. 
  This is very widely believed. It is not been possible to 
change the sectorial leaders' minds. All that is left is to use 
the following arguments, which are aimed at proving the 
impossibility of fixing prices: 
  -- first, not less than R100 billion per month would be 
needed for the budget to compensate the petroleum sales 
organizations; 
  -- and second, a fixed price for gasoline and diesel fuel 
would lead to their disappearance from sale and to profiteering. 
Thus, at the height of the sowing season, a village simply will 
not receive them or will receive them, but, all the same, at an 
increased price. Later, the profiteers will submit a bill to the 
Ministry of Finance as well in accordance with the procedure for 
"compensation" for holding down prices. 
  There is no way we will be able to get away from further 
liberalization of prices, first and foremost, for coal and a 
number of other key products. Only in this way will it be 
possible to stop the constant shaking up of the economy by price 
explosions: we hold down prices for several months and then we 
increase them many times over. For a number of items, it is 
necessary to have a smooth increase in prices, without sharp 
jumps. 
  9. The Monetary Policy and the Central Bank of Russia 
  All of the government's efforts in the area of the monetary 
policy in the first 4 months were aimed at a gradual restriction 
of the amount of centralized credit extended: 
  -- for the first time, a summary of all credit flows was 
produced; 
  -- a credit emission limit for the second quarter in the 
amount of 30 percent of that of the first quarter (R3 trillion) 
was stipulated by the Central Bank of Russia; 
  -- and the question of a firm limitation on previously 
uncontrolled credits to CIS countries was raised. 
  At the same time, the Central Bank of Russia's official rate 
was raised to the level of 100 percent, along with the deposit 
rate in the Savings Bank. 
  The government's credit policy is being formulated by a 
special commission which includes Central Bank of Russia 
representatives. 
  The undertaken measures are clearly inadequate: 
  -- the Central Bank of Russia opposes the limiting of 
credit; 
  -- the Central Bank of Russia is continuing to oppose 
raising 
its own rates to the market level; 
  -- the Central Bank of Russia is continuing to grant 
sectorial credits, as well as technical credits and cash to CIS 
countries; 
  -- and the Central Bank of Russia is not giving out the 
needed information on its own activities. 
  Without cooperation from the Central Bank of Russia, 
lowering 
the rate of inflation will be nearly impossible.

-- the Russian Federation Government Chairman V.S. Chernomyrdin 
[on Bilateral Russian-Kazakh Commission] 
  1. On 7-9 October, in Moscow, the first meeting took place 
of the Bilateral Russian-Kazakh Commission on Ensuring Practical 
Measures for the Fulfillment of the Multilateral Agreement on 
the Establishment of a New-Type Ruble Zone and of the Bilateral 
Intergovernmental Agreement on the Unification of Monetary 
Systems and the Assessment of Their Fulfillment. 
  At the same time, the expert working groups carried out the 
initial comparison of the legislative acts of the RF and the 
Republic of Kazakhstan in the areas of the monetary, budget, 
price, tax and currency policies, as well as those of foreign 
economic activities and customs regulation. 
  2. It was noted at the meeting that, despite the lack of 
substantial differences between the parties' basic legislative 
acts in the indicated areas, which creates a basis for the 
completion of the work on the unification of the legislation, it 
is necessary to carry out additional work to eliminate the 
differences in the standard acts under these laws, by which, in 
practice, the implementation of the first level of laws is 
provided. 
  In order to accelerate the work in this direction, the 
Kazakh 
side has taken upon itself the obligation to ensure the 
unification of the standard acts under these laws within the 
shortest possible time frame. 
  The assessment of the fulfillment of the obligations 
accepted 
by the Kazakh side should be carried out according to a set of 
agreed-upon synthetic indicators which characterize the 
readiness of the Republic of Kazakhstan's monetary system for 
unification with the RF's monetary system. The working groups 
have been instructed to prepare the list of indicators by 15 
October 1993. 
  3. It was repeatedly emphasized in the course of the 
negotiations that the parties support the dynamic and consistent 
establishment of all the necessary prerequisites for the actual 
unification of the monetary systems, the most important ones of 
which, in accordance with the signed agreements, are the Kazakh 
side's ensuring of a stable exchange rate for the Kazakh ruble 
with respect to the Russian ruble and the unification of the 
gold and currency reserves. 
  The practical work on the establishment of the appropriate 
mechanisms for the agreements' implementation in this part has 
not yet been started. Meanwhile, without these key elements, the 
unification of the monetary systems will remain on paper. 
  The only thing inadequate is the formal correspondence of 
the 
standard and legislative base and it is necessary to establish 
and to place into effect quickly the mechanism for the 
convertibility of the Kazakh and Russian rubles, the procedure 
for the unification and joint use of the gold and currency 
reserves and the procedure for credit emission control and 
budget deficit funding. 
  4. In light of what has been stated, something which is 
causing extreme concern is the unexpectedly adopted decision to 
speed up the pace of the unification of the monetary systems of 
Russia and Kazakhstan without consideration of the economic, 
organizational and technical prerequisites actually existing for 
this and without carrying out an assessment of the parties' 
degree of readiness for this extraordinarily important decision. 
  In violation of the letter and the spirit of the signed 
agreements, which stipulate the necessity of a transition period 
for preparing for the unification of the monetary systems, the 
ratification of the named agreements by the Republic of 
Kazakhstan's Supreme Soviet is becoming the sole condition for 
this unification. 
  The ratification stipulated by the agreements (or a 
procedure 
which replaces this) is not required from the Russian side. 
  The corresponding entry has been made in the Bilateral 
Commission's protocol without consideration of the opinion of 
the key ministries and departments which participated in the 
negotiations. At the same time, the protocol, in point of fact, 
is becoming a document which confirms the Russian side's consent 
to the immediate unification of the monetary systems with the 
Republic of Kazakhstan. 
  5. Under the influence of the RF Central Bank's management, 
the plan for immediately conducting a one-time exchange of 
old-series banknotes for series 1993 Bank of Russia notes in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan is again being moved to the forefront. 
This has already been rejected repeatedly by the government. It 
is being proposed that the exchange be carried out at the rate 
of 1:1, which means a direct economic loss for Russia measured 
in billions of rubles (at the present time, the official 
exchange rate for 1 Kazakh ruble amounts to 0.67 of a Russian 
ruble). 
  The Bank of Russia's motivation with respect to the urgent 
necessity of this step is simple -- the reserves of old-series 
banknotes for supplying cash to the CIS republics are running 
low. Thus, in order to solve this technical problem, created by 
the Bank of Russia itself, which can also be solved by other 
means (for example, by resuming the production of the old 
banknotes or by putting appropriate overprints on banknotes to 
be shipped beyond the RF's borders), the bank's management is 
ready to forego the Russian ruble's stability. Behind this 
paradoxical attempt by the Central Bank to undermine the 
country's monetary system, for the stability of which it has 
direct responsibility, as before, stands the longing to convert 
the RF Central Bank into a supranational organ not under the RF 
Government's control. 
  6. While actively supporting the necessity of accelerating 
the establishment of the operating mechanisms for economic 
integration between Russia and the CIS republics and taking into 
consideration the extraordinary importance of the practical 
steps in this direction on the eve of the elections in Russia, 
we nevertheless consider it necessary to declare that the 
short-term political gain from the unprepared inclusion of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan in the Russian ruble's zone of 
circulation will immediately be canceled by a new, powerful 
inflationary explosion, which is the inevitable consequence of 
the planned action. 
  If it is taken into consideration that, following 
Kazakhstan, 
similar demands for the immediate exchange of cash money will be 
put forward by the other republics participating in the 
Multilateral Agreement, then the barely begun financial 
stabilization process will be wrecked. The hyperinflationary 
shock caused by this unconsidered decision will make impossible 
economic integration within the framework of the CIS and will 
provoke the collapse of the monetary system in Russia itself. 
  7. Being aware of the listed consequences, we consider it 
necessary: 
  -- to suspend from the Russian side the implementation of 
Point 4 of the Bilateral Russian-Kazakh Commission's protocol; 
  -- to hold immediately a meeting of the Presidium of the 
Council of Ministers -- the RF Government and the Governmental 
Commission on Credit Policy on this matter; 
  -- to instruct the RF Ministry of Finance to conduct an 
examination of the RF Central Bank with respect to the facts 
about the unauthorized shipment of banknotes beyond the RF's 
borders, as well as of the procedure for conducting an audit and 
for bookkeeping for emission and cash transactions; 
  -- to impose a ban, right up to the completion of the 
examination, on the shipping of series 1993 banknotes by the 
Bank of Russia beyond the RF's borders, with the exception of 
the amounts acquirable by the CIS republics using funds in a 
correspondent account, through an interstate credits account or 
in exchange for freely convertible currency; 
  -- and to raise the question of the professional compliance 
of the current chairman of the RF Central Bank, V.V. 
Gerashchenko, and the deputy chairman of the RF Central Bank, 
V.I. Solovov.

<H5>  Memorandum to the Members of the Council of Ministers -- the </H5>
RF Government on the Critical Financial Situation and the Fate 
of the Reforms in Russia 
  A critical situation has arisen with respect to the 
political, financial and economic stabilization. The fate of the 
reforms is being threatened. This is not yet noticeable to 
everyone, but decisions must be made as quickly as possible, 
taking into consideration the inevitable aggravation of the 
political tension. The political struggle has quite specific 
boundaries, caused by the state of the economy. 
  1. The Elections and the Possible Defeat of the President's 
Policy 
  The country is on the eve of elections and there are only 
two 
approaches to ensuring victory. 
  The first is to abandon the financial stabilization policy, 
to distribute credits and to swell the budget deficit (the path 
of the Supreme Soviet and the opposition). This is the path to 
ruin. The jump in inflation and the economy's collapse will 
reduce to naught all the thus-earned political dividends even 
before the voting. This scenario of the development of events 
has already been realized in Ukraine with well-known 
consequences for the structures of power. 
  The second is to keep the financial stabilization policy and 
to strive for a real lowering of inflation. Only a lowering of 
inflation can show the voters the real successes of the reforms. 
Only a lowering of inflation guarantees the revitalization of 
investments and a way out of the crisis. 
  2. Stabilization Prerequisites 
  In the first half of the year, the president and the 
government pursued on the whole a consistent economic policy 
which produced quite specific results: 
  -- some slowing down of the inflation rate; 
  -- stabilization of the ruble's exchange rate over the 
course 
of more than 2 months; 
  -- the beginning of the improvement of the budget; 
  -- the limiting of the unfounded extension of credit. 
  This policy received international support and, at the 
meeting in Tokyo in June of 1993, a financial aid package for 
Russia was adopted. 
  All this testifies to the fact that we have a chance for 
financial stabilization and a way out of the economic crisis on 
the whole. 
  3. The Possible Development of Events 
  In July and August of 1993, the situation changed abruptly. 
Clearly noted was a departure from the stabilization policy 
under pressure from the opposition and individual members of the 
government, which could not be justified by good intentions of 
any kind. 
  If this trend is maintained, we can easily predict a 
possible 
scenario for the development of events: 
  The pressure from the various lobbies will force us to swell 
the deficit and to distribute preferential credits. Inflation 
will jump up by year's end to 40-50 percent per month and the 
ruble's exchange rate will "fall" to at least R2,000 to the 
dollar. 
  In a number of sectors, including agriculture, metallurgy 
and 
the coal industry, we are rapidly approaching the world prices 
with an almost complete lack of structural changes, of an 
increase in efficiency and of stabilization of production. This 
brings the threat that, by the fall, there will be a sharp drop 
in the competitiveness of our goods within the country, 
disastrous unemployment and a production slump with further 
intensification of inflation and the curtailment of investments 
and an increase in the flight of capital from the country. 
  4. The Budget Failure 
  Given all the struggle for the budget, it is in critical 
condition for the following reasons: 
  -- the loss of part of the revenues because of the Supreme 
Soviet's rejection of our draft budget (up to R4 trillion); 
  -- the constant adoption of decisions unfunded by revenues 
and other sources in the budget, despite the presidential edict 
of 3 June 1993; examples are the subsidies for mixed feed (R1 
trillion), the overstating of prices for grain (by at least R1 
trillion), the increase in the minimum wage level and many other 
expenditures for trillions of rubles; 
  -- and the lack of clear-cut coordination during the 
adoption 
of decisions which touch upon financial matters (often without 
consideration of or despite the Ministry of Finance's opinion). 
  Prior to year's end, the "hole" in our budget may exceed R8 
trillion, but attempting to close it, given the current 
politics, is pointless. 
  5. The Credit Failure 
  The struggle against inflation envisions limiting 
centralized 
credits and, first of all, preferential credits. We made it 
through the second quarter and the goverment, jointly with the 
Central Bank, pledged to limit the increase in credit extended 
to year's end, including in the third quarter, to a 30-percent 
increase in credits. This would ensure a lowering of inflation. 
  However, it is clear by now that the increase in credits may 
reach 50 percent in the third quarter. This threat is becoming 
real for the following reasons: 
  -- the collapse of the budget (see above); 
  -- the flood of additional credits in defiance of the 
Governmental Commission on Credit Policy (first and foremost, 
for agriculture); 
  -- the Central Bank's distribution of credits for the 
regions' so-called "urgent needs." 
  The government, as a collegial organ, does not see the 
entire 
picture of the financial situation in the country and does not 
realize the macroeconomic consequences of the decisions being 
made. The continuation of this financial policy means a change 
of course and the failure of the reforms. 
  During the financial stabilization period, the financial 
policy should be unified and have a single and firm management 
center. 
  6. The International Aid Failure 
  The president and the government have repeatedly pledged to 
pursue a stabilizing financial policy. This has been confirmed 
by the declaration on the economic policy, signed by the 
government and the Central Bank on 22 May 1993, which is also 
the basis for obtaining international financial aid. 
  In the spring of 1993, we received $600 million from the 
World Bank. In July, the first IMF credit was in the amount of 
$1.5 billion. The Paris and London clubs of creditors gave us 
deferments on the debts. This was of great importance for the 
improvement of our financial situation. 
  In September, another $1.5 billion were supposed to be 
received from the IMF and, by year's end, $600 million from the 
World Bank (this refers only to budget credits). On the way are 
funds for the privatization program ($3 billion), standby 
credits ($4 billion) and numerous bilateral programs. 
  After the "famous" monetary reform and the failure to comply 
with the control figures for the basic budget and credit 
variables the above-indicated above forms of international 
support were placed in doubt (this has been officially 
announced). 
  A real prospect is that we could be declared bankrupt and 
all 
credits would be stopped. There is no need even to talk about 
the loss of the international prestige of the president and the 
government. 
  7. The Way Out of the Situation 
  In the existing situation, it is necessary to make a 
political choice: either the struggle against inflation and a 
harsh stabilization policy or a change in policy, the 
repudiation of international support and isolation. 
  If the first version is chosen, there should be a 
declaration 
of a financial state of emergency, which means: 
  -- adopting, without the Supreme Soviet, an emergency budget 
(a set of measures) for the period up to the end of the year, in 
which new revenue sources will be introduced and unsound 
expenditures will be cut off. Such a budget cannot be adopted by 
consensus and a political decision is necessary; 
  -- pledging unconditionally not to accept new expenditures 
of 
any kind at least up to the end of the year; any decisions on 
the allocating of financial resources should have sources; 
  -- placing the Central Bank under the authority of the 
government for at least 6 months within the framework of the 
financial state of emergency in order to ensure the unity of the 
financial and credit policy; 
  -- enhancing the status of the Commission on Credit Policy 
in 
order to weaken the pressure on the government, making it a 
presidential organ, and concentrating in it all financial, 
monetary, currency and credit matters (with the elimination of a 
number of other commissions); 
  -- and increasing the third quarter's credit limit up to a 
maximum of 40 percent and turning to the IMF with an explanation 
of our situation in order to obtain assistance to the fullest 
extent. 
  Continuing the established fallacious practice of adopting 
decisions on credit, budget and currency matters means 
repudiating the policy of the president and the government for 
financial stabilization and the economic reforms. We need to 
obtain a budget which will be unconditionally fulfilled 100 
percent, even if it will also be very strenuous. The existing 
underfunding situation should be stopped. 
  8. The Governmental Commission on Credit Policy (Fedorov, 
Chubays, Gerashchenko, Mashchits, Moskovskiy, Shapovalyants, 
Gaydar, and Kazmin) examined the matter of the country's 
financial situation and adopted a decision to request that it be 
submitted to a special meeting of the government, also that a 
request should be made to the IMF that consultations be started 
on the financial and economic policies. Pending the discussion 
of the matter in principle in the government, the commission 
decided not to examine the matter of the allocation of 
additional credits. 
  The work has begun on the preparation of a set of measures 
for stabilizing the financial situation for examination in the 
government. 
  I request that the members of the government submit their 
own 
proposals on this matter. 
  [Signed] B.G. Fedorov; August 1993. 
<H5>  Report to RF Government Chairman V.S. Chernomyrdin </H5>
Concerning the Working Center's Information on the Currency 
Policy and the Inadvisability of the Struggle Against 
Dollarization 
  1. I cannot in principle agree with the conclusions about 
the 
impossibility or the harmfulness of the struggle against 
dollarization of the economy. 
  In addition to the purely political significance, this 
matter 
is directly associated with the strengthening of the national 
currency and the effectiveness of the state's monetary policy. 
  Abandoning the struggle against dollarization would 
undoubtedly mean acknowledging defeat in the struggle for a 
strong national currency. 
  2. The failure in the struggle against dollarization was one 
of the big mistakes of the last few governments of the USSR, 
when the absurd transition was permitted away from the limited 
circle of "Berezkas [foreign currency stores]" with primarily 
substitute means of payment (certificates and VPT checks 
[foreign money orders]) to the widespread introduction of 
foreign currency into circulation. Well known is the unfortunate 
experience of Kamentsev's absolutely correct decision, which was 
crushed under absurd pretenses. 
  It is well known that the matter is rooted in the Torgsins, 
unfortunately famous at one time, which were established under 
Stalin and which reflected a quite specific type of economic 
policy. It is typical that the people deciphered the name 
TORGSIN (trade with foreigners) as: Tovarishchi, Opomnites! 
Rossiya Gibnet. Stalin Istreblyayet Narod [Comrades, come to 
your senses! Russia is perishing. Stalin is destroying the 
people.]. Dollarization is currently leading to the death of 
Russia's financial system. 
  No less well know is the fact that the reforms in nearly all 
the countries of Eastern Europe have automatically entailed the 
closing of currency-only stores, including even prior to the 
particular successes of the economic reform and with the help of 
administrative methods. 
  3. In the purely professional sense, it is absolutely clear 
that the ousting of the national currency from the payment 
transactions: 
  -- devalues this currency, in this instance, the ruble (a 
stronger currency is more fully supplied with goods); 
  -- distorts the statistics of trade, of the balance of 
payments and so on; 
  -- makes the measures for monetary, currency, customs and 
other regulations of little effect; 
  -- sharply increases the possibility of tax evasion; 
  -- leads to groundless disproportions in prices; 
  -- promotes the flight of capital from the country; 
  -- disturbs the investment process; 
  -- discriminates against the country's citizens and 
belittles 
the national dignity; and produces approximately 1,500 other 
negative features. 
  It is impossible not to understand this. 
  4. Since 1989, I have been constantly trying to draw 
attention to the problem of dollarization but, apparently, 
unsuccessfully. It is not surprising that M. Gorbachev and N. 
Ryzhkov did not understand this in their time, but it is 
surprising that some of our reformers do not understand this. 
  Meanwhile, the scope of the problem is rapidly increasing: 
  -- in Russia, already just under a thousand retail trade 
enterprises are trading for currency; add in the hotels, 
restaurants, bars, sports clubs, airline companies, taxi drivers 
and many other things and it becomes clear that the infection is 
spreading unceasingly; 
  -- whereas, in 1990, we estimated the total amount of cash 
currency in the country to be approximately 10 percent of the 
amount of cash rubles, now, the cash dollars outnumber rubles by 
several factors (based on the market exchange rate); 
  -- the epidemic dollarization is whipping up the demand for 
foreign currency, driving the ruble into a corner and 
intensifying the disparity between the exchange rate and the 
purchasing power parity; 
  -- just the uncovered instances of tax evasion due to 
dollarization amount to many billions of rubles and, in fact, it 
could be trillions; 
  -- the balances of many commercial banks already consist by 
two-thirds of foreign currency and this alarming process is 
increasing and so on and so forth. 
  The conclusion: we are at the point when it is necessary to 
make a choice between dollars and rubles. It is clear that this 
means a choice between an independent economic policy and a 
puppet one. 
  5. It is clear that the economic methods (first of all, the 
raising of the interest rates) play a key role in the struggle 
against dollarization. Therefore, we have demanded and will 
demand from the Central Bank an increase in the rates in order 
to make saving money in rubles worthwhile. At the same time, it 
is well known that not a single country in the world is carrying 
out economic policy using purely economic, indirect levers. On 
the other hand, the administrative basis and the harshness of 
the penalties for violating the laws in any market economy are 
much higher than in Russia. 
  6. In principle, there exist no absolute, comprehensive and 
definitive methods for combating dollarization and also no 
obligatory preliminary conditions for this struggle. 
  In the USSR, prior to perestroyka, dollarization had been 
extremely limited at least because, purely administratively, 
there was no use for foreign currency. In Bulgaria today, 
trading for currency has been administratively banned and the 
lev's exchange rate is currently less than 30 lev to the dollar 
(in our country, it is almost 1,100), although everyone 
remembers that, not long ago, the lev and the ruble were 1:1. 
  Even a deficit-free budget is not an obligatory prerequisite 
for the start of the struggle against dollarization, although 
this is feasible as a theoretical desire. How many countries 
currently have or had in the past a deficit-free budget? There 
simply are no such countries. Another matter is the fact that we 
have pledged to try to fund the deficit exclusively through the 
issuing of securities. 
  Nor is the argument that it is first necessary to introduce 
100-percent selling of currency. This thesis is false in 
principle. Let us take in hand the IMF's reference book on 
currency restrictions. How many of the more than 160 countries 
have such selling currently? Very few. We have already let the 
moment pass when such a measure was possible and now it is 
causing the additional flight of capital, since, after what 
happened with the Foreign Economic Activity Bank, there is no 
confidence. Only the ruble's steadfastness, firm financial and 
monetary policies and normal interest rates will compel the 
selling of currency. 
  It is impossible to take away the right to possess currency, 
but it is also impossible to tolerate discrimination against 
one's own currency in one's own country. Currently, this is 
happening everywhere, even in Moscow, in the center of the city. 
  7. A curious argument being put forward is the thesis about 
the fact that combating dollarization will require an increase 
in the issuing of cash money. 
  The liberal economists should know that the amount of cash 
money in circulation, in principle, is generally of no great 
importance, if there is a normal emission procedure. This means 
that the cash money is acquired (purchased) by commercial banks 
from the central bank for non-cash money, i.e., a buying and 
selling transaction is carried out. At the same time, the cash 
money in the central bank's balance should be counterbalanced by 
currency, gold and state and other securities. It is not the 
cash emission which is destructive, but rather, the credit 
emission -- the distribution of specific credits by our Central 
Bank, using assets created out of thin air. 
  The banknote policy of the Central Bank, which has a free 
hand in this area, is a purely technical matter not associated 
with profound economic processes. Judging by appearances, the 
ability to divine a trend has emerged in the bank. 
  So that this argument is simply untenable. 
  On the other hand, a comparison of the market value of the 
currency supply and the ruble cash supply shows that all our 
efforts at revitalizing the ruble may prove to be of little 
effect, if a blow is not struck against the use of foreign 
currency within Russia and, first of all, the use of cash which 
does not go through the banks, avoiding control, statistics and 
taxation. 
  8. The failure to adopt measures for a decisive struggle 
against dollarization is equivalent to the acknowledgement of 
defeat and the lack of a national monetary policy. Measures 
within the framework of this struggle should include without 
fail: 
  -- a guaranteed obligation to accept the national currency 
-- 
rubles -- for all types of payments in the country; any instance 
of refusal to accept rubles should be classified as a crime; 
  -- a ban on the acceptance of foreign cash currency for 
payments, i.e., its obligatory exchange for the national 
currency; 
  -- a ban on demanding payment in a foreign currency for any 
services or goods, including for foreigners; a specific example: 
at the ruble's present exchange rate, we should be a supercheap 
country and be earning a great deal from foreign tourism. In 
practice, however, we are earning next to nothing and the number 
of tourists has decreased even in such cities as St. Petersburg, 
since currency is being demanded for everything at prices higher 
than European ones. As a result, we have a parallel economy 
which is profitable only for its direct participants and is 
corrupting the country; 
  -- a ban on receiving wages in a foreign currency; 
  -- a total ban on settlements between residents in a foreign 
currency; 
  -- the freedom to save foreign currencies in Russian banks 
and the gradual expansion of the opportunities for using it for 
current and other transactions; at the same time, the state 
should attempt to see to it that saving money in a foreign 
currency gradually becomes economically unprofitable; 
  -- a tightening up of the demands on authorized banks as 
currency control agents; 
  -- the full application and tightening up of penalties 
provided for by the articles on currency transactions (no one 
has abolished them) and by the law on currency regulation and 
the tax legislation, including the seizing of accounts, the 
closing of the violating enterprises, fines and other items. 
  9. Many of the indicated measures have already been 
announced 
in one form or another (laws, edicts and decrees) and have under 
them a specific legislative basis. The problem lies in the fact 
that no one has even actually tried to implement the adopted 
decisions and now the essentially criminal inertia is being 
portrayed as the impossibility of doing something. It cannot be 
said that nothing is being done, but what has been done is still 
a fraction of what is necessary. 
  It is necessary to demand firmly, first of all, from the 
Central Bank, the Service for Currency and Export Control, 
customs, the tax inspectorate and the tax investigation 
department, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of 
Security, the adoption of real and decisive measures in this 
area. If the authority is lacking, it should be granted. One 
would think there would be no opposition to this from any part 
of the political spectrum. 
  The dollarization problem directly adjoins the problem of 
the 
flight of capital and the concealment of currency earnings and 
they should be solved together, including by very harsh measures. 
  10. It is obvious that the failure to adopt harsh measures 
for the struggle against dollarization along with the pursuit of 
the above-indicated monetary policy may lead to irreversible 
processes, when the ruble's stabilization will be held back 
primarily by this factor. Even now, the monstrous level of 
dollarization is significantly devaluing the government's 
efforts in the monetary and financial areas. 
  As necessary as air is an administrative jolt which would 
get 
the financial stabilization process moving and blow up the 
sluggishness of our economic system. 
  This is why I consider the procrastination in the adoption 
of 
specific measures for combating dollarization to be intolerable.

<H5>  The Theses of Finance Minister B.G. Fedorov's Speech at the </H5>
RF Supreme Soviet Session on 27 August 1993 
  Esteemed Supreme Soviet Deputies: 
  At today's meeting, only the first point of the president's 
table of amendments is of essential importance. This is the size 
of the republic budget's deficit. If this amendment is voted 
down, then the adoption of all the others will no longer be of 
any significance. And I want to say a few words about this. 
  The deficit which you adopted -- R26 trillion (originally, 
the deputies had incorrectly added up the expenditures for the 
budget items and were talking about R22 trillion -- a small 
error!) -- is an almost unique phenomenon in world practice as 
we know it. I would like you to ponder its economic and 
financial consequences. 
  Over the first 8 months, the actual budget deficit, taking 
into account the foreign credits, amounted to around R7 trillion 
and, consequently, for the Supreme Soviet's budget for the 4 
subsequent months of the year, the deficit increases by almost 
R20 trillion, i.e., R5 trillion in frivolous emission funds will 
be pumped into the economy monthly. 
  Considering the fact that further indexing of the budget is 
quite likely and the fact that there are still Central Bank 
credits for various needs plus benefits, we can, over these few 
remaining months of the year, go to R10 trillion in monthly 
credit emission, carried out, supposedly, for the economy's 
normal development. 
  The experience of all the countries of the world, including 
our experience of the last 2 years as well, clearly shows that a 
financial system which has this kind of emission goes to pieces 
and hyperinflation moves from the area of theory into the 
practice of daily life with well-known results. 
  Hyperinflation means, first of all, the impoverishment of 
the 
people. Even Lenin, an authoritative person for many in this 
hall, stated correctly that inflation is the worst type of 
compulsory loan. Inflation is a tax on each person in the 
country and on every enterprise. And the experience of all the 
countries where there has been hyperinflation shows that the 
stratification of society under these conditions reaches a 
critical point, a group of superrich people is formed and all 
the rest become impoverished. The "middle class" disappears. 
These are inflation's consequences. I will not talk next about 
investing, saving and an increase in production which, in 
principle, are impossible in the existing situation in our 
country. 
  I suggest that you ponder also the experience of Ukraine 
which, to a significant degree, adopted this inflationary 
development path. You know what happened recently with the 
Ukrainian karbovanets and you know how empty the stores there 
are and what kind of increase in inflation there is in Ukraine. 
I do not think that copying this experience would be good for 
the Russian economy. 
  A couple of words about the International Monetary Fund. 
Lately, there have frequently been complaints directed at the 
government and the Ministry of Finance that they are supposedly 
operating on this organization's orders. I assume total 
responsibility for declaring that all these accusations are 
unsubstantiated and false. We have actually joined the IMF and, 
like all the other member countries, we give it specific 
information about the state of our economy and hold 
consultations, but there has never been and will never be any 
talk about dictating anything to us. The financial stabilization 
policy is our policy. At the same time, it is clear that 
additional long-term credits will not hurt anyone, including 
Russia. 
  A few words about the course of our economic policy. In a 
situation such as we currently have in our country, at all times 
and in all normal countries, there can be only one plan of 
action. When prices increase, the Central Bank adopts a program 
of credit restriction. However, if these actions do not produce 
the expected results, then it is the duty of the minister of 
finance to put forward an initiative for higher tax rates and 
the restriction of state spending. In this instance, I am 
quoting almost word for word one of the works of R.I. 
Khasbulatov (1977), who can hardly be accused of monetarism. And 
this is precisely how our draft budget was put together. 
  As far as state support of the economy and the underfunding 
of the various sectors go, it is necessary to be fully aware of 
the fact that it is by far not always necessary to resort to 
subsidization as a constantly operating factor (although we have 
used it and will again), since this can cause stagnation at 
enterprises and a lag in the realization of scientific and 
technical progress. At the same time, it is necessary to avoid 
parasitical attitudes, lack of initiative and lack of economic 
enterprise. The constant and protracted injections by the state 
testify to the fact that, through the state budget and taxes, 
other sectors of the economy are being bled dry, for they are 
the source of these "injections" and the country is thereby not 
achieving the desired overall upswing in the economy. Again, 
this is almost a word-for-word quote from R.I. Khasbulatov 
(1987), who, with such opinions, might well become the minister 
of economics in our government. 
  There was a meeting yesterday of the Presidium of the 
Russian 
Government, which, over the course of 4 hours, discussed the 
grave financial and economic situation which exists in the 
country and specific measures for its improvement, which are 
quite similar to R.I. Khasbulatov's above-cited recommendations. 
  I have already repeatedly appeared here and explained why 
the 
underfunding and, in general, the tension with the budget are 
arising. At fault are both the executive and legislative powers, 
who constantly adopt decisions not secured by revenue sources. 
We propose to abolish a portion of these decisions and to seek 
opportunities for increasing revenues and reducing expenditures. 
Part of these measures will be submitted to the Supreme Soviet 
and part to the president to be formalized as edicts, however, 
the government intends to implement a large part of the measures 
independently. 
  In light of everything which has been said, the examined 
draft budget is absolutely unacceptable. From my point of view, 
it leads to the collapse of the country and I ask you not to 
adopt this budget and not to approve this deficit. I appeal to 
your civic stand, each of you specifically and all of you 
together. Finances and the budget should not be the hostages of 
any political battles, no matter which branches of power are in 
the conflict. In this instance, I am talking about Russia. 
History and the people will not forgive us if this budget is 
adopted. 
  If political ambitions prevail all the same over the 
interests of Russia's peoples and even over basic common sense, 
then I would like to remind you of P.A. Stolypin's words which 
were addressed to your Duma colleagues: "All your attacks have 
been calculated to cause in the government and in authority a 
paralysis of both will and thought and they all come down to two 
words addressed to authority -- 'hands up'." To these words, 
ladies and gentlemen, the government, with complete calm and 
with the realization of its correctness, can also respond with 
just two words -- "not intimidated."

August 1993 on Russian Federation Minister of Finance B.G. 
Fedorov 
  Having discussed the situation which exists in the budget 
and financial sphere of the Russian Federation and assessing the 
activities of Russian Federation Minister of Finance B.G. 
Fedorov in this process as destructive the Russian Federation 
Supreme Soviet decrees that: 
  The Chairman of the Council of Ministers -- the Russian 
Federation Government, Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, is 
ordered to submit to Russian Federation President Boris 
Nikolayevich Yeltsin a recommendation concerning the removal 
from office of Russian Federation Minister of Finance Boris 
Grigoryevich Fedorov. 
  [Signed] R.I. Khasbulatov, Chairman of the Russian 
Federation 
Supreme Soviet, Moscow, the Russian House of Soviets. 
<H5>  On Russia's Financial and Economic Policy in 1993 </H5>
  Russia's economy is in a profound crisis which threatens 
to develop into a total collapse with unpredictable economic, 
political and social consequences. The decline in production and 
the decrease in capital investments, the disorganization of 
state finances, the increase in inflation, the decrease in 
currency receipts and the undermining of the country's solvency 
are being accompanied by a sharp lowering of the standard of 
living for broad layers of the population. 
  Under these complicated conditions, Russia's national 
interests require the drawing up of a strict and consistent 
policy aimed at: 
  -- the financial and monetary system's stabilization; 
  -- the elimination of economic disproportions and the 
production structure's improvement; 
  -- an increase in the efficiency of foreign economic 
relations and the restoration of the country's solvency; 
stopping the subsidization of foreign states through prices and 
credits; 
  -- and ensuring the social protection of the population. 
  Currently, the economic policy's priority direction should 
be 
financial stabilization and the strengthening of the ruble. The 
main danger is hyperinflation, which leads to economic 
catastrophe and the impoverishment of people. Restraining 
inflation is a condition for solving other most important 
problems of the economic policy. The implementation of 
stabilization measures is also a decisive prerequisite for 
attracting the large foreign resources necessary for Russia's 
economic revitalization. 
  The following should be considered the basic special-purpose 
guidelines of 1993's financial and economic policy: 
  -- lowering the rate of inflation by year's end to 5 percent 
per month; 
  -- reducing the consolidated budget's deficit to 5 percent 
of 
the GDP; 
  -- stabilizing the ruble's exchange rate by the second half 
of the year; 
  -- lowering the rate of decline for production and gradually 
stabilizing it; 
  -- increasing the rate of savings and capital investments 
with a simultaneous decrease in the share of state consumption; 
  -- increasing the share of expenditures for social security; 
  -- restraining the increase in unemployment. 
<H8>  I. Financial Stabilization and the Strengthening of the </H8>
Ruble's Exchange Rate 
  The government's policy in this area should be aimed, 
first of all, at eliminating inflation's main causes, 
neutralizing its destructive impact on the economy and the 
people's well-being and reducing the rate of price increases. It 
is proposed that the following emergency measures be adopted for 
these purposes. 
  1. Within a 2-week period, a draft law should be prepared 
and 
presented to the president for submission to the RF Supreme 
Soviet, which provides for: 
  -- gradually reducing the federal budget deficit with its 
maximum values being set for each quarter (10 percent of the GDP 
for the first quarter, down to 8 percent of the GDP for the 
first half of the year, down to 6 percent of the GDP for 9 
months and down to 5 percent of the GDP for the year); 
  -- the intolerability of exceeding the established quarterly 
limits; 
  -- making decisions about increasing budget spending only 
when actual funding sources are available, to the extent of the 
incoming revenues; 
  -- tightening up control of the execution of the state 
budget 
and the amount of state debt; 
  -- giving the government the authority to reduce (sequester) 
federal expenditures or to impose emergency taxes and fees in 
the event of an unforeseen decrease in revenues for a period of 
up to 6 months. 
  2. In order to reduce the federal budget's deficit, within a 
month, a program for strict economy should be developed, which 
inherently includes measures for: 
  -- determining the directions and amounts of all types of 
subsidies and grants and adopting urgent measures for 
translating them into an obvious form (a preference for grants 
to consumers and not to producers); 
  -- reducing direct and hidden grants to unprofitable 
enterprises and accelerating their reorganization, clean-up or 
closure; determining within the framework of the federal program 
for the structural reorganization of the economy the specific 
list of enterprises subject to closure or clean-up with an 
indication of the amounts of the grant reductions; 
  -- refining the federal program for the structural 
reorganization of the economy in order to obtain a clearer 
determination of the priorities for the economy's development 
and the concentration of capital investments in these directions 
and start-up projects with a simultaneous reduction in the 
number of construction projects using budget funding and 
preferential credits; 
  -- reducing the expenditures for compensation for the 
differences in prices and, in particular, reducing substantially 
the grants for compensation for the difference in coal prices; 
  -- increasing revenues from the privatization and sale of 
state property, stipulating their crediting to the fund for 
supporting entrepreneurship and small business; 
  -- discussing with the Supreme Soviet proposals on the use 
of 
the Central Bank's profits for covering the federal budget's 
needs; 
  -- analyzing the effectiveness of tax breaks and abolishing 
unsound ones, first and foremost, those for export-import taxes, 
the VAT and the tax on profits, i.e., for expanding the tax base 
(the proposals for abolition as of the second quarter); 
  -- introducing fixed payments for the use of oil and gas 
fields and other natural resource sites, which provide for the 
confiscation into the budget of the differentiated rent and the 
convergence of domestic and world prices for energy resources 
with a simultaneous raising of the rates for the taxes on 
profits (with the exception of the portion used for investing) 
and above-standard wages; 
  -- reducing expenditures strictly for defense with a 
simultaneous strengthening through this of the social protection 
of military personnel and their families; 
  -- strengthening control on the part of the federal tax 
service over the receipt of tax collections; 
  -- putting in good order the structure of the administrative 
staff and reducing its size; 
  -- reducing the expenditures for and increasing the revenues 
from foreign economic activities. 
  3. Over the course of 1993, a mechanism should be 
established 
for funding the budget deficit, which provides for stopping the 
direct extension of credit to the government by the Central Bank 
and carrying out borrowing by means of the issuing of state debt 
notes. In order to do this, it is necessary: 
  -- to approve the state's unconditional fulfillment of its 
obligations to creditors and investors, regardless of their 
legal status; 
  -- to raise the level of the interest rates for state bonds 
already issued, taking into account the rate of inflation and 
the interest rates' market level or to adopt measures for 
converting these bonds into re-issued debt notes (first quarter); 
  -- to begin issuing treasury bills and other new borrowing 
instruments, floated on an auction basis or on market terms; 
  -- to exempt the holders of state securities from all taxes 
on them; 
  -- to propose that the Central Bank adopt measures for 
encouraging commercial banks to invest in state securities. In 
particular, to grant credits to commercial banks primarily 
secured by state securities. 
  4. The anti-inflation orientation of the monetary policy 
should be strengthened, with a view toward lowering the rate of 
inflation by year's end to 5 percent per month. In order to 
achieve this goal, it is necessary: 
  -- to tighten up control over the increase in the money 
supply, determining quarterly its special-purpose guidelines and 
adjusting the monetary policy as need be; 
  -- to intensify the supervision of commercial banks' credit 
transactions and their observance of the established economic 
standards; 
  -- to change in 1993 to the regulation of the banking 
system's liquidity using the interest rates, reserve 
requirements and transactions in the state securities market; 
  -- to recommend raising, first and foremost, the level of 
interest rates for deposits in the Savings Bank by a factor of 
approximately 2 as compensation for the public's losses from 
inflation and as an incentive for saving; 
  -- to limit by strict guidelines financial assistance to 
enterprises on the part of the Central Bank, not permitting the 
automatic extension of credit to them for the purposes of 
regulating mutual settlements and replenishing working capital; 
  -- to consider during the determination of taxable profits 
the funds in currency accounts based on the Central Bank's 
current exchange rate in order to stimulate the accumulation in 
settlement accounts of enterprise funds in the national currency; 
  -- to propose that the Central Bank submit detailed 
information about its policy and transactions to the government 
once every 2 weeks. 
  5. The Russian economy should be protected from a massive 
influx of cash funds from the USSR's former union republics, 
which would have a destabilizing effect on the monetary 
turnover. In order to protect the Russian national currency, it 
is necessary: 
  -- to recognize officially as legal tender in Russia cash 
rubles issued by the RF Central Bank in the form of bank notes 
and coins, as well as ruble funds in accounts in Russian 
commercial banks and other credit institutions; 
  -- to conclude agreements with the CIS countries on payments 
and on the regulation of mutual requirements and obligations; 
  -- to stop the acceptance of payments from the ruble 
accounts 
of foreign commercial banks until bilateral or multilateral 
agreements on the procedure for settlements for mutual trade 
with the former union republics are concluded; 
  -- to determine a mechanism for the mutual exchange of 
Russian rubles and ruble funds in accounts in foreign banks; 
  -- to complete over the course of 1993 the reorganization of 
the system of relations within the framework of the ruble zone, 
proceeding on the basis of the goal of protecting the Russian 
ruble's stability; 
  -- to recognize officially the fact of the separation of the 
non-cash monetary turnover of the USSR's former republics and to 
propose to all the independent states refusing to use Russian 
rubles on their territory that they also begin their replacement 
in the cash monetary turnover; 
  -- to form institutes and legal regulations for the 
functioning of a market for the national currencies of the 
states which are former USSR republics; 
  -- to begin officially quoting the national currencies 
(including national rubles) with respect to the ruble -- the RF 
currency; 
  -- to begin the accumulation of reserves of currency 
(rubles) 
of the CIS countries as foreign currency; 
  -- to stop the RF Central Bank from granting credits to CIS 
states without special decisions of the Governmental Commission 
on Credit Policy Matters, which stipulate the providing of 
security for the repayment of credits on the part of the 
borrowing states (property and other assets); 
  -- to carry out work on converting technical credits into 
state debts of the corresponding countries with subsequent 
conversion into property. 
<H8>  II. Overcoming the National Economic Disproportions and the </H8>
Inefficient Production Structure 
  The most important task is the mobilization of finances and 
their efficient use for the economy's structural reorganization. 
In order to do this, it is necessary: 
  To encourage the public to save by: 
  -- setting interest rates for savings deposits with 
consideration of the inflation rate and the market rates for 
bank credits (January of 1993); 
  -- the Savings Bank's introduction of new methods for saving 
with favorable conditions for depositors with consideration of 
international banking practice (February-March of 1993); 
  -- the establishment of a system of state insurance for the 
people's deposits (April); 
  To carry out the mobilization of financial resources, 
without 
resorting to the indexing of working capital, in order to extend 
credits to the economy by: 
  -- expanding the network of banking institutions and 
providing an incentive for the enhancement of the quality of 
their operation (over the course of 1993); 
  -- adopting additional measures for the development of the 
interbank money market and the capital market (over the course 
of 1993). 
  To adopt measures for improving the enterprises' financial 
condition and for combating non-payments which require that: 
  -- the Central Bank, jointly with the Ministry of Finance 
and 
Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for State Property 
Management], prepare specific proposals for improving the 
settlement system and for regulating the enterprises' mutual 
obligations (by 5 February); 
  -- appeals be made to international organizations for 
technical assistance in the areas of settlement systems and 
enterprise reorganization; 
  -- assistance be given using centralized resources to a 
limited number of unprofitable enterprises for their clean-up 
and reorganization, with strict control over the special-purpose 
use of credits and a number of the enterprises' financial 
indicators (including wages) and a review of production 
efficiency; 
  -- the system for distributing budget allocations for the 
preferential extension of credit to sectors be put in good order 
(including accelerating the introduction of futures contracts in 
plant growing and replacing the mechanism for extending 
preferential credits for early shipping of products to the Far 
North with specific support for the needy layers and enterprises 
of these regions' life-support system); 
  -- in the event that an enterprise is insolvent, its 
currency 
funds in bank accounts be used to cover its obligations; 
  -- a procedure be tried out in the first half of the year 
for 
the reorganization, clean-up and stopping of the activities of 
enterprises (based on the example of 2-3 hopeless bankruptcies), 
including replacing the management, appointing emergency 
managers, imposing strict economic planning conditions, selling 
off unneeded reserves, searching for new spheres of activities 
and other items; 
  -- the work on converting the enterprises' debts into 
securities be continued; 
  -- urgent measures for the realization of the bill turnover 
and the registration of the enterprises' mutual obligations as 
bills of exchange which can be taken into account in the market 
be adopted; 
  -- the work on the introduction of changes to the Law on 
Enterprises and Entrepreneurial Activities, with a view toward 
strengthening control over state enterprises, be accelerated; 
  -- and the matter of the possibility of using the state 
enterprises' property as security for their debts, with its 
subsequent sale, be decided quickly. 
  Ensuring the rational spending of budget funds is not the 
goal of the economy's structural reorganization, for which it is 
necessary to shift from the financing of individual enterprises 
to the funding of state programs and strictly limiting the use 
of budget funds for purchasing imported machine-building 
products. 
<H8>  III. Increasing the Efficiency of Foreign Economic Relations </H8>
and Strengthening the Country's Currency Position 
  The following measures are being proposed in this area: 
  1. The improvement of state regulation of foreign trade 
along 
such directions as: 
  -- unifying foreign trade conditions and stopping the 
granting of new benefits and abolishing unfounded benefits for 
regions, sectors and individual enterprises; 
  -- accelerating the development of the customs service and 
imposing as quickly as possible customs control at the borders 
with the former union republics; 
  -- gradually replacing the setting of quotas for exporting 
energy resources and raw materials with competitive selling of 
quotas and then with an export tax in order to weaken the 
incentives for exporting and to replenish state budget revenues; 
  -- extending the value-added tax and excise taxes to 
imported 
goods in order to create equal conditions for competition in the 
domestic market and to increase budget receipts; 
  -- gradually reducing centralized exporting and importing 
and 
establishing a competitive mechanism for the distribution of 
orders for deliveries of goods for state needs for exporting 
purposes; 
  -- establishing specialized financing of exporting and 
guaranteeing export credits in order to stimulate the exporting 
of technical assistance, domestic equipment and other finished 
products (including establishing an Export-Import Bank); 
  -- completing the formation of trading conditions with 
states 
of the far and near abroad; 
  -- tightening up control over exporting and currency 
earnings 
and extending the procedures for the registration of exporters 
of strategically important raw material goods and other forms of 
export and currency control to the exporting of goods to the 
countries of the near abroad; 
  -- drawing up a federal program for developing the 
infrastructure of Russia's foreign economic relations. 
  2. The stimulation of the process for the formation of a 
national currency market as a means for the efficient 
distribution of currency resources by: 
  -- substantially expanding the circle of participants in the 
official currency market by granting licenses for conducting 
transactions in a foreign currency to private exchange offices; 
  -- developing an interbank currency market, including a 
forward market; 
  -- providing non-residents with access to the currency 
market 
in order to increase the supply of foreign currency; 
  -- removing the restrictions on ruble accounts for 
non-residents; 
  -- stimulating competition among currency market 
participants 
in order to eliminate its fragmentation and to form a unified 
currency exchange rate level throughout the entire country; 
  -- eliminating the barriers between the cash and non-cash 
foreign currency markets. 
  3. The providing of more complete mobilization of currency 
resources within the country by: 
  -- preserving the state monopoly on transactions involving 
precious metals and stones; 
  -- eliminating the restrictions on private persons opening 
bank deposits in a foreign currency and using the funds in 
currency accounts for payments, transfers and exporting abroad; 
  -- granting state guarantees to private depositors, which 
protect them from confiscation, blocking and compulsory 
exchanging of currency funds for rubles; 
  -- raising the interest rates for currency deposits to at 
least the level of the corresponding rates of the international 
money market; 
  -- limiting foreign banks' access to the domestic market (a 
high cost for licenses, a high minimum capital, a requirement 
for the reinvestment of mobilized currency resources in Russia 
and other items); 
  -- expanding the opportunities for investing currency funds 
within the country by offering new types of accounts, securities 
and other financial instruments. 
  4. The strengthening of currency control by: 
  -- declaring an amnesty for enterprises and organizations in 
the event of their repatriation within a 3-month time frame of 
export earnings illegally left abroad or foreign currency 
illegally transferred abroad from Russia, while simultaneously 
tightening up penalties for persistent violators right up to 
total confiscation of currency funds and severe criminal 
punishment of the executives; 
  -- gradually easing restrictions on current currency 
transactions for residents (natural and legal persons of 
Russia), while simultaneously strengthening control over the 
movement of capital in order to prevent the illegal exporting of 
capital abroad; 
  -- expanding cooperation with the law-enforcement agencies 
and currency control organs of foreign states in order to 
identify capital illegally exported from Russia and to prosecute 
violators in court; 
  -- providing materials, financial resources, equipment and 
personnel to the Currency and Export Control Inspectorate by 
making the corresponding subdivisions of a number of departments 
operationally subordinate to it; 
  -- publicizing in the mass media the results of the measures 
carried out in this area. 
  5. On the basis of the exchange ratios actually arising in 
the domestic currency market, the application of a single ruble 
exchange rate to foreign currencies for all international 
transactions as a uniform criterion of the efficiency of foreign 
economic activities. In order to use the currency exchange rate 
efficiently as an instrument for regulating foreign economic 
activities, it is necessary to: 
  -- shift from covert to overt (when need be) subsidizing of 
consumers of imported goods, subsequently reducing these 
subsidies; 
  -- pursue firmly the policy for stabilizing and 
strengthening 
the ruble's currency exchange rate using economic policy 
measures and regular, well-founded Central Bank interventions in 
the domestic currency market; 
  -- use foreign loans actively to stabilize the ruble and 
start negotiations with the IMF about the early release of the 
$6 billion in funds intended for this purpose; 
  -- adopt measures for combating the "dollarization" of the 
economy, in particular, ensuring the unconditional acceptance of 
the Russian national currency as the only legal tender in all 
retail trade enterprises, restaurants, hotels and other 
establishments, with the conversion, when need be, of the prices 
for foreign goods and services into rubles at a single currency 
exchange rate; 
  -- extend to residents' currency accounts the conditions 
applicable to ruble accounts in the area of the financial 
obligations of enterprises and institutions (the use of currency 
funds to pay off their indebtedness to the budget and suppliers). 
  6. Concluding agreements with the Paris Club and 
representatives of bank creditors on regulating Russia's foreign 
indebtedness, which provide for reducing the amount of the 
annual payments for servicing the debt to amounts acceptable to 
us. 
  The work on regulating the domestic currency debt should be 
accelerated. 
  7. A sharp reduction in direct and covert aid to foreign 
states in the following directions: 
  -- stopping the granting of any new credits to developing 
countries which are not honoring their own debt obligations to 
Russia or are not capable of paying back foreign loans on time; 
  -- establishing firm control on the part of the Governmental 
Commission on Credit Policy Matters over the extension of credit 
to former union republics; 
  -- shifting to settlements with all foreign states on the 
basis of world prices. 
  8. Ensuring an influx of financial resources from abroad, 
which are necessary for developing the economy and solving 
social problems. Energetically pursuing the reform policy and 
stabilizing the financial and economic situation in the country 
will make it possible to attract large currency funds from the 
following sources: 
  -- loans from the IMF, the IBRD and other international 
financial organizations; 
  -- financial and export credits from various countries on a 
bilateral basis; 
  -- direct foreign investments; 
  -- free assistance for charitable purposes. 
  The government's policy in this area should ensure: 
  -- the development of a clear-cut strategy for foreign loans 
and investment cooperation; 
  -- the establishment of the legal, institutional, 
organizational and technical prerequisites for the influx of 
foreign capital; 
  -- the efficient use of foreign resources for solving 
national economic and social problems; 
  -- the timely fulfillment of the obligations for servicing 
the foreign debt. 
  (The program was submitted to the government by Deputy Prime 
Minister B.G. Fedorov who prepared it together with a group of 
members of the government with the help of Russian and foreign 
experts.)

<H5>  Russia's Financial Policy After the Referendum </H5>
  Today in Russia, there is still a chance of overcoming 
inflation and ending the year with relative stability. The 
annual inflation rate has decreased from 2500 percent at the 
beginning of January to 1100 percent per year and it is 
necessary to support this trend by every means possible. There 
is no production slump, enterprises are really adjusting to 
market conditions and the pace of privatization is picking up. 
  However, the failure to adopt decisive and comprehensive 
measures will jeopardize, even in the next few weeks, the 
seedlings of stability. Meanwhile, in the referendum, the people 
unambiguously expressed support for the course of the reforms 
begun in 1992 and this obliges us to take steps forward, 
including possibly enlisting the help of the authors of last 
year's reforms. We have no right to betray the voters' hopes and 
to lose the pace. We have already actually lost the first 2 
weeks. 
  The economic successes are a pledge of political stability. 
Stopping the monstrous increase in prices is the only result 
which each and every person in our country will notice. An 
increase in prices when goods are available, rather than the 
percentages of a production slump, determines the actual 
prosperity of actual citizens. There is not a single government 
in the world which, having suffered defeat in the struggle 
against inflation, has been able to remain in power long. On the 
other hand, tough politicians like M. Thatcher, who beat 
inflation, repeatedly win in elections, despite the problems 
with production and unemployment. 
  Our economic reform has been based, first and foremost, on 
common sense, on practical experience and on proven methods and 
forms and not on some theory, including the bankrupt theory of a 
"planned" economy, which has inflicted immeasurable damage. The 
market was not invented by armchair marxists, but rather, by 
life. Great Russia needs to rectify the errors accumulated over 
70 years as quickly as possible and to return to a normal 
economy. 
  The most important near-term tasks of the financial policy 
come down to the following. 
  In order to avoid a budget catastrophe, it is necessary to 
impose a ban until the end of the year on the adoption by all 
branches of power of new decisions which substantially affect 
the budget. It is necessary to de-politicize the economy and to 
declare firmly that "Finances cannot be the hostages of policy." 
However, this requires postponing the fulfillment of a number of 
recently adopted decisions by approximately 2-4 months in order 
to accumulate the needed resources. 
  It is necessary to hold rigidly to the limits on the 
increase 
in centralized credit (30 percent in the second quarter and 20 
percent and 15 percent in the subsequent quarters) and budget 
deficits. It is likely that, for a real struggle against 
inflation, it will be necessary to reduce the announced budget 
expenditures by approximately 40 percent. Special attention must 
be paid to a sharp reduction in import subsidies which 
discriminate against our producers and various kinds of breaks 
and exceptions, on which we are losing trillions without real 
results. 
  Only in this way is it possible to restrain inflation and 
improve state finances. It is no secret that, as inflation 
increases, the budget deficit grows continuously and inflation 
is thereby whipped up. At the same time, inflation is a unique 
tax on enterprises (hence, the shortage of working capital), on 
the people (a lowering of the standard of living) and on the 
entire country (the flight of capital abroad, since it is being 
devalued in rubles). 
  In all of this, a strict monetary policy, the rational use 
of 
credits and the requirement for their repayment and efficient 
use are of colossal importance. The Central Bank of Russia 
should, finally, stand guard over the ruble and protect our 
national interests and this includes stopping the uncontrolled 
subsidizing of the former USSR republics (many billions of 
dollars), struggling to preserve the unity of the monetary 
system within the borders of Russia, adjusting settlements and 
transforming the interest rates into an economic regulator. 
  Unfortunately, in this we are extremely far from solving the 
problems using normal market methods. It is being suggested to 
us that we solve the problem of non-payments, which is 
associated with inflation, the imperfect nature of the 
settlement system and the dependence still of many enterprises, 
by stimulating inflation and infusing new inflationary funds 
into the economy. The question arises: are we to conduct the 
so-called creditings every 6 months? There is a limit to 
everything and you cannot cut the bough on which you are sitting. 
  No matter how strange it is, the struggle against inflation 
assumes a further liberalization of prices. For example, the 
level of subsidization of the coal industry comes to at least R2 
trillion. At the same time, everyone acknowledges the need to 
close dozens of inefficient mines, but nothing is being done. Is 
there any country in the world where the coal subsidy amounts to 
20 percent of the budget revenues? Profitable mines should live 
well, but poor ones need to be closed. The opposite path -- 
subsidizing all of them -- reduces interest in results, ruins 
the budget and intensifies inflation. 
  Moreover, our strange tactic of "restraining" some regulated 
prices over the course of many months and then raising them many 
times over all at once is an additional and even more dangerous 
source of inflation. We first scoff at a sector which is losing 
profitability and then we throw into the economy a chain of 
sharp price rises which creates chaos and does not permit 
enterprises to enter into a normal operating rhythm. Along with 
the popular decisions on pensions and wages, this price policy, 
rather than the "bad" enterprises, gives the country a fever and 
creates "the inflation of costs." This is why, in order to 
regulate prices, it is necesary to introduce a system of monthly 
regulation (for example, gas and transport tariffs) with a delay 
with respect to the inflation index (for example, 0.75 of a unit 
of increase in the price index). 
  Finally, a set of measures for expanding the currency market 
in order to stabilize the currency exchange rate should be among 
the immediate tasks. How much is it possible to talk about the 
need to admit non-residents and to restrict the circulation of 
foreign currency, where is the interbank currency market and 
where is the stimulation of foreign investments? Only by 
increasing the influx of currency into the market, including by 
tightening up the monetary policy and currency control and 
removing the various kinds of customs and tax obstacles is it 
possible to manage to bring the ruble's exchange rate to a more 
realistic level. 
  But fixing it artificially, as is being proposed, would be 
suicide and the end of the reforms. The Russian ruble's exchange 
rate, even if economically poorly grounded, reflects our 
economic mechanism, our regulation and our political situation. 
We will not be ostriches, hiding our heads in the sand instead 
of solving the problems. I believe that all obligatory selling 
of currency, and this needs to be abandoned gradually, should 
proceed through the currency market. It is impossible to accept 
a practice whereby you sell currency today to the Central Bank 
at one exchange rate, but you receive rubles when the exchange 
rate has already changed by 30 or 40 percent. 
  Financial stabilization and a firm ruble are possible and 
there are prerequisites for this. Just after several months 
people would feel this, the ruble's exchange rate would 
stabilize and interest rates would begin to decrease. It is only 
necessary to display the political will.

<H5>  Emission Is Opium for the National Economy (Notes on the </H5>
Obvious) 
  "Emission is opium for the national economy." First USSR 
People's Commissar of Finance G.Ya. Sokolnikov -- one of the 
fathers of the financial stabilization of the twenties -- at one 
time proposed hanging such a sign near the VSNKh [All-Russian 
Soviet for the National Economy]. Today, such a sign would be 
just right in the Central Bank or the Russian Supreme Soviet. 
  There is hardly any need for special proof of the obvious 
truth about the fact that people are alarmed, first and 
foremost, by prices, or more specifically, by the increase in 
them, i.e., inflation. Just the lowering of inflation will be 
felt by one and all. The fetish of production for the sake of 
production and the unreliable figures for the volume of 
production or purchases are not things you can have for supper. 
  What is even stranger is that many forces -- from the 
parliament and PRAVDA's editorial staff to managers and 
academicians -- do not want to or cannot understand this. What 
is being repeated is the situation at the beginning of the NEP 
[New Economic Policy], when the Narkomfin [People's Commissariat 
of Finance] was accused of an "anti emission bias" and of 
destroying industry. During those years, just like today, the 
"Red Economic Managers" were certain that the crisis was not in 
an excess of money, but rather, in its shortage, in the lack of 
working capital and in the inadequate attention toward 
investments. Just like today, there were calls to fight against 
the "dictatorship" of the People's Commissariat of Finance. 
  It must be said that the Bolsheviks had wisdom and the 
country did get stable money which became the basis for an 
economic upturn. Unfortunately, history did not teach anything 
to a great deal of people and financial stabilization is opposed 
to the interests of industry and the people, which is either a 
lie for purely political purposes or a delusion. 
  Let us leave aside the politicians who are ready to destroy 
the state in order to remove a disagreeable government. The 
sincere lack of understanding of the stabilizing financial 
policy is based, first and foremost, on economic ignorance and a 
lack of understanding of the laws of a market economy. 
  For example, Let us take the thesis: We will issue more 
money 
and we will help everyone (science, health care, education and 
the army). A typical delusion. Emission does not give anything 
to anyone -- it takes from those who have something. Given a 
fixed quantity of goods, an increase in the money supply means 
only one thing -- devaluation of the money and an increase in 
prices. In increasing pensions through emission we are taking 
money away from the teachers. In giving something to the 
teachers through this same emission, we will take from the coal 
miners and so on. Emission (inflation) is the worst form of tax 
on enterprises, citizens and the state. Not to understand this 
is criminal. 
  Under the conditions of uncontrolled inflation, there can be 
no normal development of production nor a rise in the standard 
of living. On the contrary, inflation destroys savings, 
investments and long-term credit and gives rise to the flight of 
capital, a technological lag and the sharp stratification of 
society into a handful of superrich and an indigent majority. 
This is precisely why we are coming out so sharply against the 
budget approved by Russia's Supreme Soviet since it is aimed 
directly at the disintegration of our economy and the 
impoverishment of the masses. 
  That same G.Ya. Sokolnikov successfully compared the calls 
for development through emission with the requests of a dying 
person who demands morphine from the doctor in order to lessen 
the pain. By injecting the morphine, it is possible to ease the 
death pangs. But if there is hope for a recovery -- why poison 
the body with a toxin? This would be the gravest of errors. Let 
us continue this comparison -- even a healthy body degenerates 
from the frequent use of narcotics, becoming absolutely hopeless 
at a certain stage. We have already reached this stage. 
  The widespread thesis of our current "Red Economic Managers" 
is that the emission will go for production needs and for 
investments, which will lead to an increase in the supply of 
goods and, finally, it will reduce inflation. They say that 
struggling against inflation is possible only through an 
increase in production. Besides, such delusions have not shown 
up currently. The problem lies in the fact that the money is 
being spent right away, while the production effect is 
frequently achieved after years, if it is at all. 
  Financing investments through emission is a dangerous folly. 
Inasmuch as the inflationary effect occurs almost immediately, 
while the capital investments have a lengthy cycle, then, after 
just a month or two, the money initially issued will not suffice 
and new inflationary infusions will be needed. The larger the 
inflationary investments, the higher the inflation and the lower 
the effectiveness of these investments. 
  Today, every cook and every deputy are trying to give 
instructions on how to pursue the financial policy. Every "Red 
Economic Manager" is trying to discuss monetarism, although he 
understands this subject no better than he does the theory of 
relativity. Let us discard the theories. There was no monetarism 
50 or 100 years ago, but everyone knew how to fight against 
inflation. 
  Almost every day, we hear: of course, the deficit is bad, 
but...; of course, we understand the country's difficult 
financial situation, but.... All the branches of power should 
rise above the important but private matters and concern 
themselves with ensuring the interests of the state as a whole. 
Yet a rise in the economy and in the standard of living always 
begins from the stability of the money, no matter how much the 
populists want to prove the opposite, placing immediate 
political goals above the national economic interests and 
attempting to regulate a market economy using the methods of the 
economic practice of the period of stagnation [the Brezhnev era]. 
  The means for combating inflation are well known and, in 
essence, do not depend on the type of economy. It is simply that 
in a planned economy inflation is manifested in the shortage of 
goods, while it is manifested in the rise in prices in a market 
economy. 
  No one throughout the world has yet devised anything new in 
comparison with lowering a budget deficit by reducing spending, 
increasing revenues (including through taxes) and tightening up 
monetary policy (first of all, by raising interest rates). 
  These simple methods are often extremely painful, but they 
are of basic importance. At the same time, the experience of 
dozens of states shows that the faster financial stabilization 
is carried out, the faster the economy and the people get on 
their feet. We have already been mocking the country for 8 years 
-- instead of obtaining normal money in a year. 
  Under contemporary conditions, calling for lowering taxes, 
for example, by a factor of 2 without reducing spending means 
calling for increasing emission. On the surface, this is a very 
popular slogan but, in actuality, with emission funding of the 
deficit, this would mean the redistribution of the available 
monetary resources from all to a few, which will not save the 
economy and will intensify the social stratification even more. 
All this is not as absurd as it is dangerous. 
  Today, we still have a chance of going forward to a normal 
economy and a normal standard of living. The disease needs to be 
treated rather than neglected. Otherwise, the sick person will 
finally die.

Minister of Finance; 15 September 1993. 
<H5>  The Losers in the Struggle Against Inflation also Lose the </H5>
Elections 
  Elections and an election campaign never promise anything 
good for the economy. This is why the faster they proceed, the 
better. 
  It is very important not to fall routinely into the abyss of 
pre-election populist promises. At the same time, the faster a 
competent parliament emerges, the faster the balance between the 
branches of power will be restored. 
  This year was marked by the fact that the majority of the 
practical people and the theoreticians finally understood that 
the state's economic policy consists by three-fourths of the 
financial and monetary policies. 
  The people have sensed the ruble's importance. Be that as it 
may, 1993 was much more stable than the preceding year. Hardly 
anyone can accuse the government today of changing the rules of 
the game too often. The mutual crediting of the enterprises' 
indebtedness through emission was not permitted, emission 
replenishment of working capital did not occur and technical 
credits and deliveries of cash to CIS countries were stopped. 
  The Central Bank's interest rate, which had remained 
unchanged from May of 1992 through March of 1993, was raised to 
210 percent, i.e., by 100 percent. The rates for deposits in the 
Savings Bank rose sharply. As of 1 October 1993, preferential 
credits were abolished (i.e., subsidies were not put into the 
budget). In July, the system of obligatory selling of currency 
was changed (only through the market). The ruble's exchange rate 
is being stabilized over the course of 4 months (and no one 
simply believed in this any more). 
  The liberalization of prices for coal, oil, grain and bread 
has continued. A system of subsequent indexing of prices for 
certain other monopoly goods and services has been adopted. The 
import subsidies have been done away with for all practical 
purposes, i.e., a unified currency exchange rate is actually 
being used. 
  Credit in the current year is increasing substantially more 
slowly than it did last year. The governmental commission on 
credit policy has started working: during last year's critical 
third quarter, Central Bank credit increased by 185 percent, 
while it did so by only 50 percent this year. 
  Despite all the difficulties, the budget restrictions were 
carried out and, still, we are setting the goal for the budget 
deficit at 10 percent of the GDP. At the same time, for the 
first time, securities have begun to be used to fund the deficit 
(state treasury notes and gold certificates). 
  In 1993, for the first time, Russia felt itself to be a real 
member of the world community -- successful negotiations have 
been held with the "Big Seven" and the first IMF and IBRD 
credits have been received ($2.1 billion). 
  However, the most important result, apparently, is the fact 
that the situation has settled down. We have begun to 
understand it much better and the economic policy has gradually 
started to take on an intelligible form. 
  But there were also failures produced by the extreme 
sluggishness. The state machinery, in essence, is operating 
using old methods and, in addition, is constantly being eaten 
away by the irrepressible transfer of the most skilled workers 
into commerce (especially financial, credit, tax and currency 
specialists). Instead of cutting the staff and sharply raising 
wages, we are constantly producing unneeded departments. 
  Under these conditions, it has still not been possible to 
carry out really radical changes, especially in agriculture. As 
a result, we have not been able to reduce subsidies to the 
needed extent and the budget deficit as a whole. The sectorial 
part of the government frequently refuses to think about the 
sources of funds and does not understand the overall 
macroeconomic picture. Reducing subsidies and inefficient 
expenditures as a whole is our next task. 
  The mechanism for extending credit through centralized 
resources has not been changed and, as a result, we have very 
poor repayment of these credits. Many of the sectorial workers 
view the centralized credits in the old way, as a form of free 
financing. The credits should, undoubtedly, be repaid, while 
purely budget expenditures should be in the budget. If we do not 
work out mechanisms for extending credit and financing the 
Agro-Industrial Complex and for supplying the North prior to the 
end of this year, then 1994, in this sense, may prove to be lost. 
  The Central Bank of Russia has still not turned into a real 
central bank and its monetary policy leaves much to be desired. 
There is no flexible interest policy, there is no normal system 
for the refinancing of commercial banks, the many accessible 
levers of the monetary policy are not being used and the needed 
bank oversight is almost non-existent. 
  Despite the numerous promises, real measures for combating 
dollarization were not adopted in 1992. However, the fact that 
the Central Bank of Russia recently adopted after all a decision 
on banning cash settlements in a foreign currency as of 1 
January 1994 is encouraging. In addition to protecting the 
ruble, this measure also has purely political significance. 
Moreover, it will stimulate settlements using credit cards. The 
main thing is that the words did not blow away in the wind as 
has happened before. 
  The problem of the non-payments, although it has become much 
less significant than it was in 1992, still remains extremely 
acute. A decision has been prepared on the compulsory conversion 
through commercial banks of overdue indebtedness into notes with 
specific repayment time frames. This means that bankruptcy 
procedures can be applied to defaulters after the expiration of 
the note's period. 
  1994 will be the year of budget reform, which includes 
the separation of the budgets and the transition to a new 
classification. The separation of the budgets means the 
separation of the income tax and the profits tax, i.e., the 
federal parliament establishes its own taxes, while the 
parliament of a federation entity establishes its own taxes. At 
the same time, the VAT will remain a federal tax based on a 
single rate for deductions for all the territories and will be a 
source for the redistribution and subsidization which are 
inevitable under our conditions. The transition from a 
unitary budget system to a federative budget system will 
occur. 
  This system, naturally, will give freedom of actions to 
"strong" regions which will have real budgets and will stop 
making humiliating trips to Moscow. The "weak" regions will 
receive subsidies at the 1993 level and will be forced gradually 
to learn to live within their means. 
  The new budget system will make it possible for such regions 
in default as Bashkortostan, Tatarstan and Yakutia to find an 
honorable way out of the dead-end situation. A single-channel 
nature for paying taxes is intolerable in a unified state. You 
can refer as much as you want to any documents, but the shift to 
"payments" to the federal budget will mean the end of Russia. 
The fact that Bashkiria and Tataria have already adopted 
measures for regulating the indebtedness to the federal budget 
for 1993 raises hope, although the key questions should be 
decided in the 1994 budget. 
  The ruble zone remains a colossal problem. There are no 
opponents of economic and currency integration. Everyone is for 
establishingt a large "common market" and restoring normal 
commercial exchange between the former union republics. However, 
very few people understand the complexity of this matter. There 
are quite a few people who are in a hurry to recreate the USSR 
without looking at the economic realities. The largest and most 
imminent danger is the merging of the monetary systems and 
deliveries of cash to other countries without a real merging of 
the economy and without real coordination of economic policy and 
practice. This unprepared merger will be a catastrophe for 
Russia. It is another matter if someone wants to join our 
federation. 
  Foreign aid has never been and is not now a key factor of 
the 
financial policy and of the reforms in Russia as a whole. At the 
same time, in the form of new credits, investments and debt 
deferments, it can promote the acceleration of movement forward 
and an easing of the transition period's negative consequences. 
It is necessary, as quickly as possible, to abandon the 
commodity and investment credits which the governments of the 
Union and Russia took on an enormous scale -- this is a matter 
for enterprises and companies. Centralized importing 
should die off completely. 
  The state's role is purely financial credits for 
replenishing 
currency reserves and solving the foreign debt problem. 1993 was 
marked by the development of the negotiating process with the 
Paris and London clubs, but without everything being put in 
order at home. As a result, irresponsible declarations appeared 
about the desirability of writing off the debts, i.e, actually 
acknowledging Russia's status as a helpless "third world" state. 
It is impossible to agree with this, all the more so since 
abandoning debt payments is equivalent to stopping new credits 
and investments. 
  We need a firm political will in order to keep the budget 
deficit within reasonable limits (R4.6 trillion in the fourth 
quarter), to continue the harsh limiting of credit and to 
achieve a rate of decline in the ruble's exchange rate by an 
approximate factor of 2 below the rate of inflation. Currently, 
there is still a real chance of achieving financial 
stabilization and lowering inflation by December to 15 percent 
per month and to 10 percent by February of next year. Only these 
achievements will demonstrate the correctness of the course. 
  The losers in the struggle against inflation also lose the 
elections.

<H5>  A "Financial Constitution" for Russia </H5>
  On days when everyone is discussing the upcoming elections 
and the referendum on the constitution, it is not out of place 
to recall also the basic provisions of the financial policy, 
which, strictly speaking, are somewhat more important than a 
discussion about the participation or the non-participation of 
ministers in the parliament (although, in my opinion, legitimate 
ministers will not impede either the government or the 
parliament). 
  We are talking about the compilation of the simplest 
principles and provisions, which can arbitrarily be called a 
"financial constitution." All these principles have undergone 
the test of time and practice in dozens of countries in the 
world and it would be useful to us in Russia to use this age-old 
wisdom. Without this, we will never achieve real financial 
stabilization and simple order in the economy. 
  The First Principle. The Central Bank is independent of both 
the government and the parliament; its main task is supporting 
the national currency's stability and the level of prices. One 
would think that these are obvious things, something already in 
the law. However, we do not yet have a real monetary policy and 
the Central Bank is ready to discuss whatever you want, except 
the struggle against inflation. 
  At the same time, the Central Bank's independence should 
include the principle of the irremovability of its head over the 
course of a fixed term, if he performs his main task as 
indicated above. The Central Bank's head should not receive or 
solicit any kinds of instructions from the government and the 
parliament within the limits of his authority, including by the 
direct telephone which was inherited as a legacy from the USSR 
State Bank. 
  The Second Principle. The government does not have the right 
to obtain credits from the Central Bank and is obliged to cover 
the budget deficit exclusively using loans from non-financial 
institutions and the public in the form of securities and other 
similar instruments. In turn, the Central Bank does not have the 
right to extend credit to non-financial institutions, to grant 
special-purpose or sectorial credit or to purchase securities 
directly from the federal government or a local government. 
  And here everything is obvious -- the size of the deficit 
should be determined by the confidence of the public and 
companies in this government. If they purchase the securities 
there is confidence and, if they do not purchase them, reduce 
the deficit. Covering the deficit using Central Bank "credits" 
(i.e., emissions) means stimulating inflation and the collapse 
of the economy. 
  The Third Principle. Any spending decisions above the 
approved budget can be made only after a preliminary 
investigation of the source or a reduction in other expenditures. 
  In private life, everyone understands that if there is no 
money in your pocket and no one will make you a loan then the 
purchase must be postponed. In public life in our country, 
everyone is very good and spends money which is not there. But 
if money is created out of thin air, given the same amount of 
goods, then, without a doubt, prices increase and those who 
earned money by working, having sold their own product, are 
robbed. This destructive practice is extremely dangerous and 
directly contrary to the national interests. 
  A most trivial thing is needed: before spending or promising 
money, reduce other expenditures, impose a new tax, sell 
something or simply curb your appetite. Only deceiving the 
people is prohibited. 
  The Fourth Principle. The parliament can accept or reject 
budget expenditures submitted by the government, but it does not 
have the right to initiate spending. We already have dozens of 
adopted laws and decisions which are impossible to fulfill 
without destroying the state. 
  It is annoying to hear on television: "The Ministry of 
Finance is not fulfilling the law on support of the northerners 
(grain, military personnel and so on and so forth) and the 
government's other promises." First, the government does not 
adopt the laws. Second, the Ministry of Finance is not a wicked 
uncle who hides money and does not give anything to anyone -- 
there simply is no money. And third, many laws (just like edicts 
and decrees) simply cannot be fulfilled, have not been checked 
and have not been well grounded. 
  The former Supreme Soviet, with enviable persistence, 
attempted to take the place of the executive power and wanted to 
give, distribute and extend credit itself. This is a clear 
violation of the principle of the separation of powers. Yes, the 
government has made and is making a lot of mistakes, but there 
should be only one accountable in the country, so that there 
would be someone to hold responsible. Logic of the type "we will 
promulgate the law and let them try not to fulfill it" is 
intolerable in a civilized state. 
  I suggest to all parties, movements and candidates for seats 
in the State Duma to whom Russia's interests are dear that they 
support the indicated provisions, which have been tested in real 
life, and include them in their own campaign programs. Then we 
will finally see the day when everything embedded in the budget 
will be fulfilled, while the prices in the stores will cease 
going through the roof.

<H5>  The Dollar Will Cost R10,000, if We Retreat from the Reforms </H5>
(the New Year's Prediction of Finance Minister Boris Fedorov) 
  The current financial policy is causing a strong reaction 
in the opposition. And this means that a consistent financial 
policy has been implemented. 
  Prices over the past year increased by a factor of 9 (as 
against a factor of 26 in 1992), while the rate of increase in 
prices amounted for the first time to 12 percent in all in 
December. The results could have been better many times over, if 
it had not been for the budget compromises, the promises of new 
allocations, which were not backed by financial sources, the 
artificial overstating of the purchase prices for grain and our 
continuous struggle against the Supreme Soviet, the Central Bank 
and the sectorial lobbies in the government. 
  Lowering inflation means easing the problem of the shortage 
of working capital and the devaluation of savings and 
investments. This is why even the production slump in the past 
year was not as great as the opposition had prophesied. However, 
900-percent inflation is still catastrophically much and it is 
simply ridiculous to talk as if we had too harsh a policy or 
shock therapy. Only incompetent or dishonest people can reason 
so. It is typical that, in all sectors without exception, wages 
in 1993 increased more than inflation did. 
  Back at the beginning of the year, we were criticized for an 
understated and unrealistic ruble exchange rate. But from June 
through year's end, the exchange rate decreased in all from 
R1,100 to R1,250 to the dollar, i.e., in all by 10 percent while 
prices increased by a factor of approximately 4. Our prices are 
fast approaching world prices, which means the end of the era of 
prosperity for low-efficiency industries which lived through the 
enormous price explosion. Now, many do not like the 
strengthening of the ruble, although this is a direct method for 
combating the exporting of our national wealth at a low price. 
  The time has come to ask the many authoritative managers of 
giant enterprises and the generals of agriculture -- but what 
about your labor productivity and why should we support you when 
your goods are going for the world price, but you are paying the 
people kopecks? I consider it a violation of human rights when I 
am forced to buy an item at a price higher than the world price, 
yet it cannot stand up to criticism of any kind. 
  We managed in 1993, over the fierce resistance of the 
Central 
Bank and a number of members of the government, to stem the flow 
of money, subsidies and credits to the CIS countries. 
  In 1993, despite the resistance of the Central Bank and 
various sectorial lobbies, we managed to raise interest rates 
substantially and to reduce the various benefits which always go 
to the least strong and efficient and are driven into the 
ground. What did this produce? First, the savings of the public 
and enterprises are now much better protected from inflation. 
And second, the all-devouring demand for gratuitous credits on 
the part of the Russian economy's "black holes" has been sharply 
restricted. It is no secret that outright plundering of state 
assets is going on behind the fine slogans about supporting one 
sphere or another. 
  I do not know who will be at the rudder of Russian financial 
policy in 1994 -- this is for the president and the prime 
minister to decide, but I think that it is necessary to demand 
from those who lay claim to power absolutely specific steps and 
obligations. I would consider the minimum program for 1994 to be 
the following: 
  -- the people's savings: provide interest rates higher than 
inflation so that savings would actually increase and people 
would be able to accumulate money for long-term purchases. Until 
this is done, there will be no investments and industrial 
upswing. At the same time, it is necessary to pay reasonable 
compensation for savings for the losses from the liberalization 
in January of 1992, but through non-inflationary sources; 
  -- the public's real incomes should increase by at least 20- 
30 percent and the dollar equivalent of the average monthly wage 
should increase from $100 to $250; it is necessary to introduce 
tax regulators which reduce the disparity in incomes between the 
richest people and the poorest people; 
  -- inflation should, in the very near future, be reduced to 
less than 5 percent per month, which is equivalent to 80 percent 
per year. This will mean an opportunity to reduce the interest 
rates' overall level, to stimulate investments and for 
enterprises to plan their own activities; 
  -- to the extent that the budget deficit is reduced to 5 
percent or less of the GDP and it is funded through market 
borrowing, it will be possible to reduce the tax burden on 
commodity producers; 
  -- the ruble's currency exchange rate, given a favorable 
turn 
of events, will not fall in 1994 below R2,000-2,500 to the 
dollar, which will make our exporting more significant, 
facilitate importing and force enterprises to think about 
competitiveness, productivity and quality. At the same time, all 
the remaining restrictions on exporting should be removed 
completely. 
  These are the most basic requirements for the financial 
policy in 1994. Will we have enough courage to accept these 
obligations and to answer then to the people? 
  I have carefully studied the opposition's demands and 
programs and have come to the conclusion that, in the financial 
area, no one is proposing anything basically new, except 
for a sharp increase in spending (social needs, investments 
and so on). I am all for such spending. However, no one is 
saying anything serious with respect to the sources of 
funds for these expenditures. And this means just one thing 
-- a further increase in the budget deficit and, consequently, 
inflation. But inflation, I reiterate for the hundredth time, 
strikes at the pockets of actual people, enterprises and the 
entire state. 
  On the eve of the new year, 1994, I will attempt to give a 
prediction in the event of a change in the exchange rate. A 
change in policy, a repudiation of the more than moderate policy 
pursued by us in 1993 (and correspondingly, a repudiation of the 
people who personified this policy, since a policy is always 
specific people), will mean the "Ukrainization" of our economy: 
  -- a rate of price increases by a factor of 20 over the 
year; 
  -- a dollar exchange rate in the area of R10,000 (the 
exchange rate can be fixed, so that this will be a "black 
market" exchange rate); 
  -- a further lowering of labor productivity; 
  -- a decline in the public's real monetary incomes (in 1993, 
there was an increase of 10 percent) by at least one-third; the 
dollar equivalent of the average wage will drop to $50 per month; 
  -- savings and investments will decrease in real terms; 
  -- the dollarization of the economy will intensify anew; 
  -- some prices will be fixed and an attempt will be made to 
confiscate money, especially currency, in banks; 
  -- a shortage of many types of goods will emerge again, 
stores will become empty and emigration will intensify. 
  I think that, instead of an enormous market around the Kiev 
Station in Moscow, where Ukrainians chasing after rubles, which 
have become a real currency, sell masses of goods, there will be 
a similar market in Kiev and trading there, possibly, will be 
Russians chasing after "karbovantses." I do not exclude the 
possibility that our miners will travel to Kazakhstan to earn a 
living -- currently, there are Ukrainians travelling to Rostov 
for half wages. It may be that our delegation will travel to 
Tashkent to request credits, while Russian enterprises will be 
trying to keep money in "zaychiks" in Belorussian [Belarusian] 
banks. 
  The only possible consolation for our adversaries is a 
production increase of 3-5 percent through an increase in the 
production of tanks and missiles. In truth, I do not think that 
this will bring much joy to Russia's citizens before the new 
year, 1995. 
  I do not believe people who change their views, who pursue 
one policy today and are ready to pursue another tomorrow. I do 
not believe in enterprise managers who have forgotten about 
labor productivity and production efficiency and know only one 
way to solve problems, by requesting money from the president or 
the prime minister. For us, there are only the interests of the 
state and of our citizens and they are demanding the 
establishment of strict financial order in the country and the 
continuation of the reforms, which have only one goal -- the 
improvement of our lives. 
  In the old parliament, at most 10 percent of the people 
supported the reforms and now at least 30 percent of them do. 
This is not too bad for the first time. The only way to stop 
marking time is to accelerate the reforms decisively and to draw 
closer to a normal life worthy of the citizens of a great 
country. Slowing down the reforms is the path to perdition, to 
the prolongation of the troubled times and to the betrayal of 
Russia's national interests. 
  Enough of deceiving and being deceived. Enough of false 
compromises. Enough of keeping in office people who are 
incapable of anything constructive. Enough of trying to cross a 
hedgehog with a snake -- what results, as is well known, is 
barbed wire. The elections have warned us. 
  God forbid that Russia should again swerve from the true 
path. Especially since the most difficult steps have already 
been taken and we have the forces.

Current Financial Situation (Forecast for the Third Quarter), 24 
June 1993 
  1. Analysis of the economic situation makes it possible to 
draw the conclusion that the country's financial situation may 
improve in the next 3 months and the inflation index will 
drop below 15 percent per month. 
  2. The Central Bank of Russia's interest rate by the middle 
of July should rise to approximately 150-160 percent, 
approaching the market rates. It is predicted that there will be 
an increase in the ruble's attractiveness and an 
intensification of the demand for them, as well as a tightening 
up of the policy of the government and the Central Bank with 
respect to trade and the offering of services for foreign 
currency (dollarization). 
  3. The ruble-to-dollar exchange rate has entered a stage of 
relative stability and will probably remain at a level of 
around R1,100 to $1. The arrival of large sums of 
currency in the market is expected prior to year's end, which 
will make it possible for the exchange rate to draw somewhat 
closer to the purchasing power parity. Up to $14 billion have 
been accumulated in accounts of banks in Russia and there is a 
trend toward a decrease in the flight of capital. 
  4. The credit commission has adopted a decision to fix the 
net increase in centralized credit in the third quarter at the 
level of R4 trillion, i.e., in relative terms, to maintain it at 
the second quarter's level. The second quarter's limits 
have been fulfilled both for the budget deficit allotment 
and for the remaining types of credits and credit increased 
slower than inflation by a factor of almost 2. 
  5. The plans are for the budget deficit to be kept at 
the level of 10 percent of the GDP with a gradual increase 
in issuing securities in order to fund it. In connection with 
the presidential edict on certain measures for combating 
inflation, it is anticipated that the budget will be strict but 
realistic, i.e, it will be executed much better than in the 
first half of the year. 
  6. Better execution of the budget, the limiting of 
inflation, 
the possible reduction in the amount of the obligatory selling 
of currency and the abolition of the quota system for a number 
of export items will halt somewhat the increase in 
non-payments. 
  At the same time, it is recommended that enterprises reduce 
as much as possible deliveries in the event of a risk of 
non-payment, use the capabilities of the law on bankruptcy, hire 
debt-collection firms, change the servicing banks, sell unneeded 
reserves and assets, determine the optimum size of the work 
force, and look for a more profitable line of goods, as well as 
investors and partners and ways to enter the foreign market. 
<H5>  Russian Ministry of Finance Press Release on the Status of </H5>
Russia's Budget, 29 June 1993 
  1. The Russian Government has submitted to the Russian 
Supreme Soviet a draft of the federal budget refinement. The 
stable financing of the economy and the payment of wages, grants 
and other social expenditures depend on the budget's rapid 
revision by the Russian Supreme Soviet. 
  2. The delay in submitting the budget has been caused by the 
large number of new decisions on expenditures, which have been 
adopted since the beginning of the year and which have actually 
ruined the previously adopted budget, since the previously 
unforeseen expenditures exceed R10 trillion. In addition, it has 
been necessary to index the majority of the expenditures, taking 
inflation into account, which increased the budget deficit even 
more. 
  3. The concept of a refined budget is extremely simple: a 
deficit funded through inflationary Central Bank credits should 
not exceed 10 percent of the GDP or R12 trillion, which will 
make it possible to continue the anti-inflation policy. 
Exceeding this sum, which has been determined as the maximum 
permissible amount, will mean a financial catastrophe and a 
subsequent burst of uncontrolled inflation. In this instance, 
the Russian Supreme Soviet is taking upon itself the 
responsibility for the intensification of the economic crisis. 
  4. Various measures have been undertaken in order to reduce 
the deficit, including a reduction in certain types of unfounded 
subsidies, including for importing, an increase in the excise 
taxes on energy resources, the introduction of special budget 
funds for the specific support of agriculture and the coal 
industry and a tightening up of the expenditures for the 
majority of budget items, including administrative and staff 
items. Temporarily suspending the enforcement of individual 
articles of RF laws which provide for new additional benefits 
estimated in trillions of rubles is also being proposed. 
  5. The proposed budget will be sufficiently tight, with sums 
smaller than everyone would like, but at least it will be 
realistic, i.e., it will be fulfilled 100 percent. Otherwise, we 
will again find ourselves in a situation of chronic underfunding 
of literally all the budget's items. 
  6. Signs of financial stability have been noted in the 
country and it is extremely important not to destroy them with 
ill-considered populist measures. 
  The Russian Ministry of Finance is appealing: 
  to all people's deputies with a request that they accelerate 
the budget review and make it possible to finance the economy in 
a normal fashion, at least in the third quarter; 
  to all workers and enterprises which are currently dependent 
on the budget and suffering from its collapse to display 
self-control and to await the adoption of a sensible decision by 
the Russian Supreme Soviet. 
<H5>  Declaration of the Russian Ministry of Finance on the </H5>
Central Bank of Russia's Decision on the Exchanging of Treasury 
Notes and USSR State Bank Notes Issued from 1961 through 1991 
and Bank of Russia Series 1992 Notes, 26 July 1993 
  The Russian Ministry of Finance declares its disagreement 
with the Central Bank of Russia's decision on the compulsory 
exchanging of old-series banknotes. The RF Ministry of Finance 
declares that it did not participate in preparing this decision 
and considers it politically and economically harmful. It looks 
like a planned political action aimed at causing public 
resentment of the president, his government and the policy 
pursued by them. It is no accident that this decision was 
adopted precisely at that moment when the first signs of 
financial stabilization appeared. 
  The RF Central Bank's decision signifies the latest outright 
deception of the public, which had been promised several weeks 
ago a calm, gradual withdrawal of the old notes up to the end of 
1994, and it actually comes down to the confiscation of part of 
the monetary assets of the people and enterprises, since the 
compulsory depositing means the devaluation of the money. This 
is reminiscent of the actions of the USSR State Bank and 
Pavlov's Government in January of 1991 with the well-known 
adverse results. 
  Practice has proven that using such measures to combat 
corrupt elements and criminals is of no use. The victims will 
turn out to be, first and foremost, the people who have 
accumulated money for a large purchase; vacationers; pensioners 
who do not trust banks and keep money in cash; and inhabitants 
of the remote regions of Siberia, the Far North and the Far East. 
  From the standpoint of the struggle against inflation, this 
RF Central Bank decision is not simply senseless, but harmful. 
The undermining of confidence in the state, the sharp decline in 
the ruble's exchange rate, the flight to the dollar and the 
numerous abuses and machinations during the exchange will 
inevitably lead to a weakening of the anti-inflation policy. 
  This exchange will have an extremely negative effect on the 
mutual relations with the countries which are former USSR 
republics and which, to one degree or another, use cash Russian 
rubles. Old-series banknotes are circulating in these countries; 
many of them are not prepared to introduce their own money. The 
exchange has caused chaos in these countries and a worsening of 
attitude toward Russia as an unreliable partner, which is 
already having an adverse effect on the situation of the 
Russian-speaking people living there. At the same time, matters 
regarding the future ruble zone have not been settled, as a 
result of which a new round of inflation in Russia is 
inevitable, inasmuch as the free deliveries of Russian cash 
money to the former USSR republics will continue, despite the 
fact that the non-cash money ceased to be equivalent to Russian 
money back in July of 1992. 
  On the whole, the decision about an immediate exchange of 
old-series banknotes may be categorized as a strike against the 
economic reforms in Russia and as a step which contradicts the 
president's policy and the referendum's results. It should be 
revoked immediately and the executives who prepared it should be 
held accountable. 
  For its part, the RF Ministry of Finance will make every 
effort to continue the policy of financial stability, to lower 
the rate of inflation, to ensure the Russian ruble's stability 
and to establish civilized forms of settlement and credit 
relations with the countries which are former USSR republics. 
<H5>  Russian Ministry of Finance Press Release, 10 August 1993 </H5>
  1. The Russian Ministry of Finance confirms its official 
position of unconditional rejection of the Central Bank's action 
with respect to the money exchange, about which the ministry had 
not been informed and in which it did not participate. In this 
instance, the ministry shares the opinion of the absolute 
majority of Russian citizens, not to mention that of the 
professional economists, financiers and bankers. 
  2. The Russian Ministry of Finance does not possess any 
official documents which confirm the approval by the government 
or even the discussion by the government of this action. All 
decisions of the government on monetary matters should 
absolutely be prepared with the Ministry of Finance's 
participation. According to the ministry's information, a whole 
series of members of the government did not support the Central 
Bank's action, including publicly. 
  3. The past 10 days have fully confirmed the economic 
senselessness and political harmfulness of the Central Bank's 
actions. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance is continuing to 
stand on its position about the necessity of the complete 
abolition of all restrictions on the money exchange as they are 
illegal, in order to restore the public's confidence in the 
state. 
  4. With respect to the Central Bank's delivery of R50 
billion 
in new banknotes to Uzbekistan, the Ministry of Finance has not 
received, despite the official inquiry of 2 August, any 
documents confirming the "sale" of the banknotes. The Central 
Bank has made an attempt to explain this action as a "sale on 
credit" and with clumsy allusions to documents which have no 
bearing on the matter. 
  In particular, the Ministry of Finance declares that there 
has been a direct violation of the intergovernmental agreement 
on state credit of 21 May 1993 and the supplement to it with 
full commodity breakdown of the amount of credit, which was 
approved by the Uzbekistani Cabinet of Ministers on 8 July 1993. 
Deliveries of 1993-series cash monetary notes against this 
credit have not been provided for by the agreement and the 
protocol. 
  Thus, again without an agreement with the government and the 
Ministry of Finance, an action has been undertaken, which is 
directly contrary to the Central Bank's arguments during the 
explanation of the money exchange and which exceeds the Central 
Bank of Russia's authority. 
  [Signed] The Collegium of the Russian Ministry of Finance. 
<H5>  Russian Ministry of Finance Press Release on the Current </H5>
Currency Situation, 10 August 1993 
  1. The Russian ruble's currency exchange rate has remained 
relatively stable now over the course of 2 months. At the same 
time, the increase in the ruble's popularity has forced the 
Central Bank to shift from the guideline of R1,100 to the dollar 
to R1,000 to the dollar plus or minus 5 percent. The disparity 
between the market exchange rate and the parities of the ruble's 
purchasing power is decreasing gradually. 
  2. Rumors are constantly circulating in the market about 
alleged mass Central Bank interventions and about an impending 
drop in the exchange rate and hardly professional forecasts are 
being made. Some publications have been repeating over and over 
for 60 days in a row that "this is it, tomorrow the reverse 
trend will begin." A number of commercial structures which have 
been playing at this have already lost serious money. 
  3. In point of fact, the state's currency reserves over the 
2 
months have increased by several billion dollars and, for the 
first time, every cash ruble in circulation is backed 
approximately 75 percent by hard foreign currency, while the 
entire money supply is backed by almost a third. In Russian 
commercial banks, due to the foreign trade balance, the volume 
of currency deposits is increasing continuously. 
  4. The basis of the coordinated tactics of the Central Bank 
and the Ministry of Finance in recent months is the striving to 
further the exchange rate's stability, without permitting its 
excessive and sharp strengthening, since this would inflict 
damage on exporting. 
  5. Key factors in the ruble's strengthening are the raising 
of the Central Bank's interest rates up to 170 percent, the 
adequately strict monetary and budget policies and the change in 
the mechanism for the obligatory sale of currency. 
  6. The assessment of all the above-presented factors makes 
it 
possible to talk about the possibility of maintaining a 
relatively stable ruble exchange rate up to year's end and not 
just up to September (approximately at the present level). Even 
as of August, this will begin to have a noticeable effect on the 
rate of increase in inflation in the direction if its lowering.

Soviet's Adoption of the Draft Law on Refinement of the 
Indicators of the Russian Federation's 1993 Republic Budget, 12 
August 1993 
  On 22 July 1993, the RF Supreme Soviet adopted the draft 
law on refinement of the indicators of the Russian Federation's 
1993 Republic Budget. 
  The proposals submitted by the RF Government on ensuring the 
financial system's stable functioning and aimed at strengthening 
the budget's revenue base and restraining the increase in its 
deficit were completely voted down during the discussion process. 
  The examination of the refined indicators for the 1993 
budget 
in the RF Supreme Soviet showed that the most important 
instrument of state regulation of the economy -- the budget -- 
is being used to an ever greater degree by the parliament for 
political purposes. The deputies' alleged concern for the 
Russian economy was manifested in the form of an increase in 
budget spending in practically all sectors of the national 
economy and the social sphere with a simultaneous reduction in 
revenues, which was motivated by the well-known thesis about the 
necessity of removing the "tax burden." 
  This step has been assessed by the Ministry of Finance as a 
manifestation of political populism in a hypertrophied form, 
which has nothing in common with the economic stabilization 
measures. The implementation of the budget adopted by the 
Supreme Soviet, the deficit of which has actually increased as 
against the original budget submitted by the government by a 
factor of 2-3 and amounted to R26.9 trillion, or 23 percent of 
the GDP, will mean (as world experience and analysis of the 
actual methods for funding the deficit testify) a sharp jump in 
the rate of inflation to 40-50 percent per month. As a 
consequence, there will be an equal increase in prices and 
further stratification of society through a lowering of the 
standard of living of the least protected layers of the populace 
with a simultaneous unfounded enrichment of individual groups of 
entrepreneurs. 
  Thus, the budget adopted by the RF Supreme Soviet runs 
counter to the course of economic and social development and 
cancels out the work done on stabilizing state finances. The 
execution of the adopted budget will lead to a revving up of the 
inflationary spiral, an increase in the state debt, which is 
already so burdensome for the economy and the undermining of 
confidence on the part of international financial and business 
circles which are rendering assistance in the implementation of 
the reforms in Russia. 
  Under these conditions, the RF's financial condition even as 
of October of this year may be assessed as critical, inasmuch as 
the actual funding source for the budget deficit today is only 
the Central Bank's credit emission, which should increase in the 
second half of this year by at least 100 percent, which, 
undoubtedly, is of a purely inflationary nature. 
  The measures being undertaken in conformity with the 
economic 
policy pursued by the Russian Government jointly with the 
Central Bank of Russia to hold the increase in centralized 
credit resources at the level of 30 percent, which make it 
possible to avoid a sharp inflationary pumping of money into the 
economy, as well as to limit the increase in state spending, 
will be in vain in the event that the republic budget's refined 
indicators are approved and there is a failure to adopt at this 
time the measures on introducing a number of revenue sources 
abolished by the RF Supreme Soviet. 
  We consider it necessary to report also on the violation by 
the RF Supreme Soviet during the approval of the republic budget 
of existing legislation with respect to the observance of the 
procedure for adopting the refined indicators of the RF's 
republic budget and on the permitted technical inaccuracies of 
the draft law drawn up by the Supreme Soviet. 
  In connection with what has been presented above, as well as 
with the impossibility of fulfilling the adopted amendment to 
the RF's 1993 Republic Budget because of the catastrophic 
consequences for the country's economy, we consider it necessary 
to return the draft law on the refinement of the indicators of 
the RF's 1993 Republic Budget to the RF Supreme Soviet for a 
second examination at a joint session of the Soviet of the 
Republic and the Soviet of Nationalities of the RF Supreme 
Soviet. 
<H5>  Russian Ministry of Finance Press Release, 26 August 1993 </H5>
  In order to make clearer the Postfactum agency's 
information, published 19-21 August 1993 in a number of 
newspapers (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA [FINANCIAL NEWS], DELOVOY MIR 
[BUSINESS WORLD], MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI [MOSCOW NEWS] and others), 
on the RF Ministry of Finance's incomplete use of RF Central 
Bank credits, the RF Ministry of Finance considers it necessary 
to come forward with the following explanation. 
  By RF Supreme Soviet Decree No 5312-1 (Point 6) of 1 July 
1993 on the Funding of State Expenditures from the Russian 
Federation's Republic Budget in the Third Quarter of 1993, the 
RF Central Bank is permitted to grant credit in 1993's third 
quarter to the Council of Ministers -- the RF Government, the 
manager of which is the RF Ministry of Finance, to cover the 
deficit of the RF's republic budget in the amount of R3.2 
trillion within the limits of the overall amount of credits, 
established for 1993, for the indicated purposes. 
  In accordance with the indicated RF Supreme Soviet decree, 
on 
14 July 1993, an agreement was concluded between the RF Central 
Bank and the RF Ministry of Finance on granting credit to the RF 
Ministry of Finance in 1993's third quarter in the amount of 
R2.6 trillion (against the R3.2 trillion provided for in the 
third quarter of this year). The establishment of the lesser 
amount of credits by the RF Central Bank for the RF Ministry of 
Finance for the third quarter based on the agreement in 
comparison as against the RF Supreme Soviet's limit was caused 
by the joint obligations of the Council of Ministers of the RF 
Government and the RF Central Bank, as fixed in the Declaration 
on the Economic Policy of 22 May 1993. According to the status 
report for 25 August 1993, of the credits in the amount of R2.6 
trillion provided for by the agreement with the RF Central Bank, 
R1.934 trillion have been used. The remaining R666 billion are 
intended for funding of budget deficit in September of this year. 
  As for the RF Ministry of Finance's "saving" of credits 
issued to it by the RF Central Bank for investment and 
conversion programs, in accordance with Agreement No 23 of the 
RF Central Bank and the RF Ministry of Finance of 28 April 1993, 
the Ministry of Finance is transferring funds to the 
correspondent accounts of the appropriate commercial banks after 
these banks have concluded agreements with enterprises which are 
to be the recipients of the credit. According to the status 
report for 25 August 1993, of the R400 billion allocated to the 
RF Ministry of Finance on 28 June 1993 for investment credits, 
R328.8 billion have been transferred to the commercial banks; of 
the R300 billion allocated for conversion credits, 
correspondingly, R148 billion have been transferred. The 
remaining funds intended for the indicated purposes, in the 
respective amounts of R71.2 billion and R152 billion, are being 
held in the corresponding accounts in the RF Central Bank's 
OPERU [operations administration] and will be used to the extent 
that the customer enterprises conclude agreements with the 
commercial banks. 
<H5>  Russian Ministry of Finance Press Release on Russia's </H5>
Financial and Economic Situation, 31 August 1993 
  1. The following factors were the basic causes of 
inflation's acceleration (to 25-30 percent) in August: 
  -- the banknote exchange, which provoked an influx into 
Russia of hundreds of billions of rubles in cash money from the 
CIS countries and the sharply increased demand for durable goods 
in order to use up cash money; 
  -- the increase in prices for energy resources, electricity 
and transport tariffs (an even indexing system has now been 
introduced); 
  -- the seasonal easing of the credit policy in connection 
with gathering in the harvest and the shipments to the country's 
northern regions. 
  2. The ruble-to-dollar exchange rate, despite the gloomy 
predictions of the "experts," in accordance with the Ministry of 
Finance's forecast, was stable and, if the financial 
stabilization policy is continued, it may remain up to the end 
of the year at the level of the beginning of June (R1,100 to the 
dollar, plus or minus 5 percent). 
  3. The Central Bank's monetary policy remained moderately 
harsh, although it is obvious that the centralized refinancing 
rate (170 percent) remains basically favorable when credits are 
granted for a period of 6-12 months. 
  4. The budget is, as before, the most important source of 
inflation, since approximately half of the Central Bank's credit 
emission goes for it. At the same time, in the first 8 months of 
the year, a strict budget policy was pursued and the actual 
deficit (taking into account the foreign sources for covering 
it) amounted to around R7 trillion. If the borrowing from the 
Central Bank is successfully kept at the level of R6.5 trillion 
until the year's end, then it is possible to expect a dying down 
of inflation and relative stability for the ruble's exchange 
rate. 
  5. The Ministry of Finance submitted for discussion at a 
meeting of the Russian Government's Presidium a program of 
measures aimed at financial stabilization. In particular, this 
program includes: 
  -- measures for increasing budget revenues; 
  -- the revocation of spending decisions which are not 
secured 
by revenue sources; 
  -- a reduction in subsidy-type spending; 
  -- strict measures for combating dollarization, right up to 
the closing of the violating enterprises; 
  -- the compulsory conversion of the enterprises' mutual 
indebtedness into notes with period of 3-12 months with 
subsequent application of the bankruptcy procedure to insolvent 
payers. 
  The government's presidium supported this program and 
ordered 
the drafting over the course of a week of drafts of laws and 
decrees for immediate implementation. The adoption of the 
Ministry of Finance's program in the next few days means a 
continuation of the stabilization policy and a lowering of 
inflation. 
  6. The alternatives to the harsh financial policy are the 
Supreme Soviet's destructive budget, a burst of inflation, a 
sharp decline in the ruble's exchange rate and a financial 
catastrophe which will affect one and all. High inflation always 
means the impoverishment of the masses, the disappearance of the 
"middle class," the stopping of investments and the 
impossibility of saving and social and political shocks. The 
daily experience of Russian citizens of recent years has shown 
that any increase in nominal wages and pensions is quickly 
"eaten up" by inflation. 
<H5>  Russian Ministry of Finance Press Release on Russia's </H5>
Current Financial and Economic Situation, 23 September 1993 
  1. In September of this year, no substantial changes 
occurred in Russia's financial and economic policies. The limits 
on the increase in centralized credit were exceeded somewhat, 
however, a concentrated infusion of an inflationary money supply 
into the economy was successfully blocked. 
  2. The Governmental Commission on Credit Policy, at its 
meeting on 23 September, established a limit for the increase in 
centralized credit for funding the budget deficit in the fourth 
quarter in the amount of R4.6 trillion, which means maintaining 
the financial stabilization policy. A shortage of financial 
resources above the planned deficit can be covered through a 
reduction in non-priority spending and a search for new revenue 
sources. 
  The government is issuing decrees almost daily, which are 
part of the package of financial measures proposed by the 
Ministry of Finance at the beginning of September. 
  3. The sharp decline in the ruble's exchange rate on 23 
September was not caused by economic fators, but rather, is 
associated with the political situation in the country and the 
Central Bank of Russia's inability to react rapidly to events 
using the monetary policy's available instruments. For its part, 
the Ministry of Finance will take all the steps necessary to 
ensure the stability of the ruble's exchange rate. 
  The Central Bank of Russia's interest rate has been raised 
to 
180 percent and, by governmental decree, is supposed to be 
brought up to 200 percent. At the same time, as of 1 October, 
there will be a substantial raise in the interest rates for 
Savings Bank deposits, which has been called upon to stabilize 
the situation. 
  The government has sanctioned the issuing of a gold loan for 
1993 in an amount equivalent to 100 metric tons of gold (more 
than R1 trillion), which will also further the "tying together" 
of the commercial banks' liquid assets and a decrease in the 
goverment's inflationary borrowing from the Central Bank of 
Russia. 
  4. The change in the political situation in the country 
means 
that Russia will be living according to the government's budget 
until year's end and will accelerate the carrying out of those 
stabilization measures, the approval of which previously came 
under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Soviet. 
  The government does not intend to engage in populism and, on 
the threshold of the elections, distribute cash funds right and 
left. On the contrary, the stabilization policy, the abandonment 
of mutual creditings and replenishments of working capital and 
the reduction in preferential credit extension has been 
confirmed once again. For the majority of points of the 
financial and economic policies there are no longer any 
contradictions between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry 
of Economics, which has strengthened the government's unity. 
<H5>  Russian Ministry of Finance Press Release on the Ruble Zone, </H5>
21 October 1993 
  In connection with the recent appearance of numerous 
contradictory reports about the process for the formation of the 
new-type ruble zone, Deputy Prime Minister and Russian Minister 
of Finance B.G. Fedorov has announced the following: 
  The process for the establishment of the new-type ruble zone 
does not provide for the immediate unification of the monetary 
systems right after the signing or ratification of the 
Multilateral Agreement on Practical Measures for the 
Establishment of a New-Type Ruble Zone and the corresponding 
bilateral agreements. This requires the actual convergence of 
the economies, the market institutes and the legislation. 
  The establishment of a ruble zone does not mean one-sided 
advantages for any of the parties, the automatic extension of 
credit, the unrestricted distribution of cash money and so on. 
This is a process which implies the consideration of mutual 
interests and mutual responsibility. It is necesary to go into 
it with open eyes, recognizing all the danger and the complexity 
of merging basically different economies under the conditions of 
the quite complicated situations in all the countries. 
  The signing of the multilateral agreement on the 
establishment of the new-type ruble zone does not preclude the 
introduction of national currencies in the CIS countries. 
Moreover, it is stipulated in the agreement that these countries 
may establish fixed exchange rates for their own currencies with 
respect to the Russian ruble during the transition period, which 
will also be the basis for this ruble zone. 
  Russia respects the decision of a number of states regarding 
the introduction of national currencies and does not intend to 
discriminate against them in economic and credit relations. 
  Introducing national currencies while supporting stable 
exchange rates is the most important condition for the normal 
development of trade and economic integration, since it will 
make it possible to eliminate the existing uncertainty in the 
mechanism for settlements and payments. 
  No one in Russia is coming out against economic and 
political 
integration with the former USSR's republics, in favor of which 
the economic, historical, cultural, geographical and national 
factors testify and, first and foremost, the obvious advantages 
of a large market. However, the persistent striving by 
individual executives of the Central Bank of Russia to 
accelerate this process artificially without consideration of 
Russia's actual interests and capabilities, as well as of the 
degree of readiness of the agreement's participating republics 
for the monetary systems' unification is extremely dangerous and 
unacceptable. 
  Just as stipulated by the multilateral agreement, all 
countries desiring to join the new-type ruble zone have to go 
through a transition period, in the course of which all the 
parties will have to undertake significant efforts for the 
convergence of their economies and the unification of the 
monetary systems. Just as soon as this transition period ends 
and the unification of the key economic variables and mechanisms 
for regulating the market is actually achieved, it will be 
possible to begin working on the complete unification of the 
monetary systems on the basis of the Russian ruble. Today, 
however, we are just at the beginning of this path and the 
rubles in circulation in a number of CIS countries differ 
basically from the Russian ruble, being essentially these 
countries' national currencies. Raising the question of the 
immediate unification of the monetary systems at this stage is 
premature. 
<H5>  Russian Ministry of Finance Press Release, 5 November 1993 </H5>
  The RF Ministry of Finance proposes the inclusion in the RF 
Constitution of the following provisions which may arbitrarily 
be called a "financial constitution." Without this, we will 
never achieve real financial stabilization and simple order in 
the economy. 
  1. The RF Central Bank shall be independent of both the 
government and the State Duma; its main task shall be support of 
the national currency's stability and the level of prices. 
  2. The government shall not have the right to obtain credits 
form the Central Bank and shall be obliged to cover a budget 
deficit exclusively using loans from non-financial institutions 
and the people. 
  3. The Central Bank shall not have the right to extend 
credit 
to non-financial institutions and to grant special-purpose or 
sectorial credits. 
  4. Any spending decisions above the approved budget may be 
adopted only after a preliminary investigation of the source or 
a reduction in other spending. 
  5. The State Duma may adopt or reject budget expenditures 
submitted by the government, but it shall not have the right to 
initiate spending. 
  The RF Ministry of Finance appeals to all parties and 
movements and candidates for State Duma Deputy with a call to 
support the indicated provisions, which have undergone the test 
of practice in dozens of countries, and to include them in their 
own pre-election programs.
