<SUMMARY>

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This hearing is being held to consider proposals to amend five Federal milk marketing orders. The proposals would
establish a multiple component pricing plan for pricing producer milk under the orders. Producer milk utilized in
Class II and Class III would be priced to handlers on the basis of three components. The components priced would be butterfat,
protein and solids-not-fat other than protein. Under some of the proposals, producer prices or protein prices would
be adjusted for quality attributes of milk, such as somatic cell content. The hearing was requested by a dairy trade
association and several cooperative associations that represent a substantial number of dairy farmers who supply
these markets. A number of other dairy cooperative associations and dairy organizations submitted proposals to
be considered at the hearing. The proponents maintain that the proposed payment plans would give producers a direct
economic incentive to produce the components valued by the marketplace.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This administrative action is governed by the provisions of Sections 556 and 557 of title 5 of the United States Code
and therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given of a public hearing to be held at the Sheraton Inn Airport, 2500 E. 79th Street, Bloomington,
Minnesota 55425 (telephone 612/854&hyph;1771), beginning at 9 a.m. on January 25, 1994, with respect to proposed
amendments to the tentative marketing agreements and to the orders regulating the handling of milk in the aforesaid
marketing areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing is called pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7
U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing
agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part 900). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the hearing is to receive evidence with respect to the economic and marketing conditions which relate
to the proposed amendments, hereinafter set forth, and any appropriate modifications thereof, to the tentative
marketing agreements and to the orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Actions under the Federal milk order programs are subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354).
This Act seeks to ensure that, within the statutory authority of a program, the regulatory and information requirements
are tailored to the size and nature of small businesses. For the purpose of the Act, a dairy farm is a ``small business''
if it has an annual gross revenue of less than $500,000, and a dairy products manufacturer is a ``small business'' if
it has fewer than 500 employees. Most parties subject to a milk order are considered as a small business. Accordingly,
interested parties are invited to present evidence on the probable regulatory and informational impact of the hearing
proposals on small businesses. Also, parties may suggest modifications of these proposals for the purpose of tailoring
their applicability to small business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the rules proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.
They are not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state
or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with these rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law
and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for
a hearing on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
courts of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties who wish to introduce exhibits should provide the Presiding Officer at the hearing with 6 copies
of such exhibits for the Official Record. Also, it would be helpful if additional copies are available for the use of
other participants at the hearing.

For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine
for each month the value of milk of each handler described in &sect;1030.9 (a), (b), and (c) as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The handler's obligation for producer milk shall be computed as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Multiply the total hundredweight of producer milk in Class I as determined by &sect;1030.44 by an amount equal
to the Class I differential price pursuant to &sect;1030.50(h) for the month (this amount may be negative); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the total hundredweight of producer milk in Class II as determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1030.44 by an amount equal to the Class II differential price pursuant to &sect;1130.50(i) for the month (this
amount may be negative); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the hundredweight of skim milk in Class I as determined pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1030.44 by the skim milk price pursuant to &sect;1030.50(d); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to
&sect;1030.44(a) by the average protein content of producer skim milk received by the handler (reported pursuant
to &sect;1030.30(e)), and multiplying the resulting pounds of protein by the protein price specified in &sect;1030.50(f);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1030.44(a) by the average other solids content of producer skim milk received by the handler and multiplying
the resulting pounds of other solids by the other solids price specified in

supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received less the Class III price by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat
in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to &sect;1030.43(d) and &sect;1030.44(a)(7)(i)
and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to &sect;1030.44(a)(11) and the corresponding
steps of &sect;1030.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk products from an
unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant
by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an
offset for any other payment obligation under any order; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1030.61, redesignate paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) as (c), (d), (e) and (f); revise the introductory

For each month the market administrator shall compute a producer price differential per hundredweight for Zone 1
(this price may be negative). If the unreserved cash balance in the producer settlement fund to be included in the computation
is less than 2 cents per hundredweight of producer milk on all reports, the payments required pursuant to &sect;1030.71
for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of the uniform price. The report of such handler shall
not be included in the computation of the uniform price. The report of such handler shall not be included in the computation
for succeeding months until he has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations. Subject to the aforementioned
conditions, the market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in the following manner: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Combine the values computed pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1030.60 (a)(1), (a)(2), and (b) through (k) for all handlers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Add the values computed pursuant to &sect;1030.60 (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) and subtract the value obtained
by multiplying the protein price by the handlers' total pounds of protein and by multiplying the other solids price
by the handlers' total pounds of other solids.

a. Compute the protein price by multiplying the barrel cheddar cheese price, instead of the cheddar cheese price for
40-pound blocks, by 1.32, and eliminate the plus adjustment based on the whey protein concentrate price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Include an adjustment for the somatic cell count of producer milk and for milk used in Classes II, III, and III&hyph;A.
Class I milk would not have a somatic cell adjustment. The adjustment for somatic cells would be on a hundredweight
basis and would be a positive adjustment beginning with a somatic cell count of 500,000, increasing as the somatic
cell count approaches zero. No adjustment would be applied for somatic cell counts greater than 500,000. The somatic
cell adjustment would be computed by subtracting the actual somatic cell count (in thousands) from 500 and multiplying
by .0005 times the barrel cheese price.

c. In calculating the protein price, subtract an appropriate make allowance per pound of barrel cheddar cheese from
the cheese price before multiplying by 1.32. This modification may require creation of a separate residual ``component''
in addition to the butterfat, protein and other solids components, which would require a formula to determine the
value of other milk solids (not protein).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing
Model 747 series airplanes, that currently requires that the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program include
inspections which will give no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural Significant
Item (SSI). This action would require the inclusion of additional airplanes to the candidate fleet. This proposal
is prompted by a recommendation from the Airworthiness Assurance Task Force, Model 747 Structures Working Group.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure the continued structural integrity of the total Boeing
Model 747 fleet.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 18, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8526 (58 FR 19571, April 15, 1993), applicable
to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, to require that the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program be
revised to include inspections which will give no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural
Significant Item (SSI). That action was prompted by a structural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
re-evaluation by the manufacturer which identified additional structural elements where, if damage should occur,
supplemental inspections may be required for timely detection. The requirements of that AD are intended to ensure
the continued structural integrity of the total Boeing Model 747 fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Document No. D6&hyph;35022, Volumes 1 and 2,
``Supplemental Structural Inspection Document (SSID) for Model 747 Airplanes,'' Revision E, dated June 17, 1993,
that revises the effectivity by adding airplanes to the candidate fleet on which supplemental inspections that give
no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural Significant Item (SSI) must be performed.
This document also clarifies the selection criteria for candidate airplanes. The original Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
747&hyph;100 and &hyph;200 series airplanes in the candidate fleet were selected based on having accumulated 10,000
flight cycles by June 30, 1983. Subsequently, selected high time airplanes were added to the candidate fleet to replace
out-of-service airplanes. Incorporation of the inspections described in this document will ensure the continuing
structural integrity of the total Boeing Model 747 fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the failure of an SSI can compromise the structural integrity of these airplanes, and since such conditions
are likely to exist or develop on other Model 747 series airplanes, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01
to expand the applicability to require that the inspections identified in the Boeing document, described previously,
be performed on the airplanes in the candidate fleet to provide no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR)
for each Structural Significant Item (SSI) listed in Revision E of the SSID. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the FAA has identified eight additional airplanes that are not listed in Revision E of the Boeing Document,
and that must be added to the candidate fleet to replace certain airplanes that were removed from the candidate fleet.
Some of these newly identified airplanes were operated as short range (SR) airplanes and have now been converted to
freighters. Therefore, the FAA has determined that these airplanes must be included in the SSID program, and that
supplemental inspections must also be performed on these additional airplanes to ensure safety of the entire Boeing
Model 747 fleet. The AD proposes to expand the applicability by adding these eight airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 128 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 87 airplanes of U.S. registry and 8 U.S. operators would be affected by this proposed AD. Incorporation
of the SSID program into an operator's maintenance program, as required by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, and retained in
this proposal, is estimated to necessitate 1,000 work hours (per operator) at an average labor rate of $55 per work
hour. Based on these figures, the total cost to the 8 affected U.S. operators to incorporate the SSID program is estimated
to be $440,000, or $55,000 per U.S. operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recurring inspections costs, as required by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, and retained in this proposal, is estimated
to be 1,275 work hours per airplane at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the annual recurring
cost required by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, and retained in this proposal, is estimated to be $6,100,875 for the affected
U.S. fleet, or $70,125 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since no new operators have been added by this proposal, there will be no new costs associated with incorporating the
SSID program into an operator's maintenance program. Therefore, the future economic cost impact of this proposal
on U.S. operators is now only the cost of the recurring inspections for these additional airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of required work hours for the recurring inspections in this proposal, as indicated above, is presented
as if the accomplishment of the actions were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' action. However, in actual practice,
these actions, for the most part, would be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled
airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of necessary additional
work hours will be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any costs associated with special airplane scheduling
will be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document revises an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain de Havilland Model
DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes, that would have required a one-time inspection to assess the adequacy of the clearance
between various adapter plates and seal retaining angles on the fuselage side access panel, and modification, if
necessary. That proposal was prompted by reports of incidents involving corrosion and fatigue cracking in commuter-class
airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal. This action revises the proposed rule
by requiring modification of both the forward and rear seal retention angles, regardless of whether damage is found.
The actions specified by this proposed AD are intended to prevent degradation of the structural capabilities of the
affected airplanes.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to add an airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes, was published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 4, 1993 (58 FR 12349). That NPRM would have required a one-time inspection to assess the adequacy of the clearance
between: (1) The wing forward pick-up adapter plate and the seal retaining angle on the fuselage side access panel,
and (2) the wing rear mounting adapter plates and the seal retaining angle on the fuselage side access panel; and modification,
if necessary. That NPRM was prompted by reports of incidents involving corrosion and fatigue cracking in commuter-class
airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal. That condition, if not corrected, could
result in degradation of the structural capabilities of the affected airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has received a comment that has caused the FAA to reconsider its position on
certain aspects of the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter requests that the proposal be revised to require modification of the forward and rear retention angles
and adapter plates, regardless of whether damage is found in the adapter plates. The commenter contends that if the
forward and rear seal retainers are not trimmed, they may be inadvertently interchanged with seal retainers from
other airplanes in an operator's fleet. The FAA concurs. The FAA has reviewed all available data and has determined
that in order to preclude the possibility for installing an untrimmed seal retainer in an airplane that lacks sufficient
clearance, the forward and rear seal retainers must be trimmed. Although the referenced service bulletins do not
specify trimming the forward and rear seal retainers when the seal retainers are found undamaged, the FAA finds that
safety can be best assured when the seal retainers are trimmed, regardless of whether damage is found, to avoid the
possibility for inadvertently interchanging seal retainers from other airplanes. Therefore, proposed paragraph
(a) of the previously issued NPRM has been revised to propose requiring that Modification 7/2319 (forward adapter
plates and seal retaining angle), and paragraph (b) of the NPRM has been revised to propose requiring that Modification
7/2355 (rear adapter plates and seal retaining angle) be accomplished.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, this commenter indicates that the proposed 6-month compliance time to accomplish the inspection was unnecessarily
stringent in light of the age of the service bulletins. From this comment, the FAA infers that the commenter requests
an extension to the compliance time, although the commenter does not specify an alternative. The FAA concurs that
the compliance time may be extended somewhat. The FAA has determined that extending the compliance time by 6 additional
months will not adversely affect safety, and will allow the inspection to be performed at a base during regularly scheduled
maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be available. It will also provide additional
time to accomplish the additional modification proposed in this action. Therefore, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
supplemental NPRM have been revised to require that the inspection be accomplished within 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since certain of these changes expand the scope of the originally proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is necessary
to reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 44 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
8 work hours per airplane to accomplish the modifications and inspections, and that the average labor rate is $55 per
work hour. Required parts would be nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $19,360, or $440 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator
has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

I. Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission estimates the public reporting burden for this collection of information under the proposed rule
to average 66.2 hours per respondent, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The information
will be collected under FERC&hyph;592, Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines. In lieu of being physically
filed with the Commission on a periodic basis as a ``response'' or ``filing'', the data will be updated continuously
and made available to customers/shippers, the public, and the Commission by Electronic Bulletin Boards (EBBs) established
and maintained by the pipeline respondents pursuant to Order No. 636. The annual reporting burden for some 61 respondents
under the proposed rule is estimated to total 4,038.2 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the proposed rule provides for fewer information items, the burden estimate for FERC&hyph;592 in the subject
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) represents a burden reduction of 63 hours per respondent_or a total reduction
of 3,843 hours. The current annual reporting burden attributable to the FERC&hyph;592 information collection is
7,882 hours. A copy of this proposed rule is being provided to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may send comments regarding the burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information,
including suggestions for further reductions of this burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North
Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415,
FAX (202) 208&hyph;2425]. Comments on the requirements of this proposed rule may also be sent to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Washington, DC 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(202) 395&hyph;6880].

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, in Order No. 497,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 issued a rule intended to prevent pipelines from providing preferential treatment to their marketing or brokering
affiliates. The rule adopted standards of conduct (codified at part 161 of the Commission's regulations)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and tariff and reporting requirements (codified in &sect;250.16).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The reporting requirements required the pipelines to file FERC Form No. 592, a log containing information relating
to transportation for affiliated marketers, and to maintain the same information for nonaffiliated shippers. The
Commission imposed a sunset provision requiring a reevaluation of the requirements of the rule within one year to
determine whether increased competition in transportation had mitigated the concerns about affiliate abuse. The
Commission has extended the sunset provision until December 31, 1993, and, contemporaneously with this NOPR, is
issuing Order No. 497&hyph;E which extends the reporting requirements until June 30, 1994.

Order No. 497&hyph;E also revises &sect;161.3(f) of the standards of conduct dealing with the contemporaneous disclosure
to nonaffiliates of transportation, sales, and marketing information provided to affiliates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 636, the Commission created a new operating environment for interstate pipelines and shippers by requiring
pipelines to unbundle their sale of gas from their transportation service and implementing changes in the terms and
conditions for providing transportation. One of the principal changes introduced by Order No. 636 was the initiation
of capacity release mechanisms through which firm shippers can release their firm transportation capacity, including
storage capacity, to others wanting to obtain the capacity. The Commission mandated that all allocations of firm
capacity, both firm capacity available from the pipeline and released capacity, be implemented through Electronic
Bulletin Boards (EBBs) operated by the pipelines (or operated on their behalf by third parties). The Commission also
has begun the process, in Docket No. RM93&hyph;4&hyph;000, of standardizing the methods by which pipelines will
provide information about available capacity through their EBBs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another significant change in Order No. 636 was the Commission's determination that pipelines must provide shippers
with flexible receipt and delivery points. The Commission provided this flexibility to promote efficient use of
pipeline capacity particularly through the capacity releasing mechanism. A shipper obtaining released capacity
(replacement shipper) is not restricted to using the receipt or delivery points of the releasing shipper; it is able
to select alternate receipt or delivery points for that capacity to accord with its requirements for transportation
service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission previously has addressed the effect of EBBs and capacity release on the Order No. 497 requirements.
In Order No. 497&hyph;D, the Commission eliminated the requirement that pipelines file the Form No. 592 containing
the affiliated transportation log with the Commission, requiring instead that they provide this information on
their EBBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission also determined that Order No. 497 does not apply to temporary capacity releases, because such releases
are not a request for transportation to the pipeline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The releasing shipper, not the pipeline, controls and makes the determination to release capacity; the pipeline
merely facilitates the transaction.

Northwest Pipeline Corporation, 65 FERC &para;61,007 (1993). A temporary capacity release occurs when the releasing
shipper retains its rights to the capacity when the release period ends. A permanent release ends the releasing shipper's
rights and responsibilities under the contract and the contract is transferred to the replacement shipper.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Now that Order No. 636 has been implemented on virtually all pipelines, the Commission finds this to be the opportune
time to do a comprehensive reevaluation of the Order No. 497 requirements in light of the requirements of Order No.
636 as well as the Commission's experience under Order No. 497. In Order No. 636, the Commission stated that increased
competition resulting from the unbundling of gas sales from transportation service might reduce the pipelines'
incentive for granting preferences to affiliates, but it concluded such competition probably would not eliminate
the incentive altogether.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Similarly, the implementation of capacity release may reduce the pipelines' incentive to provide its marketing
affiliates with preferences for interruptible transportation, because shippers seeking interruptible service
are not restricted to the pipeline as the sole avenue for such service, as they were in the past; they now can obtain firm
service through capacity release which is superior to the pipelines' interruptible service.

At this juncture, the Commission does not deem the evidence sufficient to warrant rescission of the Order No. 497 standards
of conduct and tariff and reporting requirements. As part of its continuing assessment of the need for these regulations,
the Commission will consider in the final rule any comments relating to the need for, and retention of, these regulations
as a whole. Nevertheless, the significant changes wrought by Order No. 636 do appear to warrant substantial revision
of the Order No. 497 standards of conduct and tariff and reporting requirements to eliminate unnecessary information
and to reduce and streamline the compliance burden. Modifications to the Order No. 497 filing requirements also are
needed to conform the regulations with the requirement that affiliate information be posted on pipeline EBBs.

The Commission proposes to eliminate &sect;161.3(h) of the regulations which prohibits pipelines from conditioning
or tieing an agreement to release gas subject to take-or-pay relief to the purchase of services from a marketing affiliate.
The Commission in Order No. 636 established procedures for dealing with gas supply realignment costs resulting from
the reformation or termination of take-or-pay contracts after the unbundling of sales from transportation service.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Revisions To Coordinate With Other Regulatory Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reporting requirements currently apply to interstate pipelines transporting gas pursuant to subparts B, G,
H, or K of part 284. The Commission proposes to remove the references to subparts H and K. Subpart H applies to capacity
release transactions and is an unnecessary and duplicative reference, since, by its own terms, it applies only to
pipelines transporting gas under subparts B and G. Subpart K, which applies to pipelines transporting gas on the outer
continental shelf, is similarly unnecessary because, it too, requires such pipelines to transport gas pursuant
to subpart G. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Tariff Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current &sect;250.16(b)(1) presently requires pipelines to include in their tariffs information about shared
operating personnel and facilities, the information and format for a request for service, the procedures used to
address complaints, and the procedures used to inform shippers about the availability and pricing of transportation
service. Current &sect;250.16(g)(1) requires pipelines to maintain and follow certain procedures to make the tariff
information available to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission proposes to eliminate the requirement, in current &sect;250.16(b)(1)(ii), that pipelines include
in their tariffs the information required for a valid request for service, including the information required for
the Form No. 592 affiliate transportation log. This provision was intended to ensure that pipelines obtained from
a shipper requesting service information known to the shipper, but not to the pipeline, which the pipeline was required
to maintain by the regulations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The information which pipelines needed to obtain included items such as the supplier of gas, the end-user, and whether
or not the gas was subject to take-or-pay relief. The requirement for pipelines to include the request for service
information in their tariff no longer appears necessary, because pipeline tariffs already include procedures for
requesting service, and more important, this NOPR is proposing to eliminate the information which the pipelines
previously had to obtain from the transportation request form. Under the proposed regulations, pipelines should
know all the relevant information, without having to obtain additional information from the requesting shipper.

The Commission proposes to eliminate the requirement, in current &sect;250.16(b)(1)(iv), that requires pipeline
tariffs to include the procedures used to inform affiliated and nonaffiliated shippers of the availability and pricing
of transportation service and of the capacity available for transportation. This requirement appears superfluous
since pipelines are required under Order No. 636 to provide equal and timely access on their EBBs to information relevant
to the availability of service on their systems.

The Commission also is proposing to eliminate the requirement, in current &sect;250.16(g)(1), that pipelines maintain

pipeline tariff information to be publicly available and the Commission's regulations already require that the
information be made available at the pipelines' offices as well as through the mail.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current &sect;250.16(b)(2) requires pipelines to file with the Commission a transportation log reporting a variety
of information related to affiliate transactions, and &sect;250.16(c) requires pipelines to maintain the same
information for nonaffiliate transactions. The Commission is proposing to reduce the amount of information that
must be maintained and to clarify the filing requirements in light of the requirement, promulgated in Order No. 497&hyph;D,
that pipelines post the information on their EBBs in lieu of filing it with the Commission.

a. Information requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing to eliminate the requirement that pipelines maintain information relating to firm transportation
under &sect;250.16. As a result of Order No. 636, the posting and awarding of firm service, including the reservation
charge for that service, will be conducted through, and reported on, the pipelines' EBBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since all the details regarding an affiliate's or other shipper's acquisition of firm service will be on the EBB, a
similar posting requirement for affiliate information under &sect;250.16 appears unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission recognizes that pipelines may offer firm shippers discounts on the reservation charge after the capacity
is awarded and also may discount the firm usage charge. But the Commission does not deem the potential for such discounting
sufficient to warrant the continuation of the reporting requirements under &sect;250.16. Such discounting has
not proven to have been extensive in the past. Moreover, information on any firm discounts that pipelines do provide
affiliates will be available on pipeline EBBs under former standard I and under the Commission's Part 284 discount
reporting requirements, although without as much detail as required by &sect;250.16. See 18 CFR 161.3(i)(revised
&sect;161.3(h)); 18 CFR .8(b)(4)(v) (requiring standards of conduct information to be posted on EBBs); 18 CFR 284.7(d)(5)(4).
In addition, the Commission's adoption of straight-fixed-variable (SFV) rate design in Order No. 636 virtually
eliminates the pipelines' ability to discount the firm usage rate as well as the impact of any discounts if they did
occur. Under SFV, the usage rate reflects only variable costs (and applicable volumetric surcharges), and pipelines
cannot discount below variable cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For interruptible transportation, however, the EBBs will not provide the relevant discount information, because,
unlike firm service, the EBBs will not be used to allocate interruptible capacity or establish a shipper's rate for
interruptible service.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The allocation of interruptible transportation and the rate for individual transactions usually takes place during
the pipelines' monthly and daily nomination and scheduling process. Accordingly, the Commission is retaining the
current requirement to maintain and post information for discounts on interruptible service (proposed &sect;250.16(c)).

 The Commission's experience in administering Order No. 497 is that the most important information for monitoring
potential undue discrimination is the discount information for individual transactions. Once that information
is known, the Commission can obtain information regarding the transportation request during an investigation if
it is needed. Indeed, some of the information on the request, such as the extent of affiliation between pipelines and
suppliers or shippers, would appear to be well known to the parties transacting business on the pipelines and should
not need to be posted.

The Commission is proposing to eliminate a series of requirements for posting information obtained from the transportation
request on the source and destination of gas.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
21
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Information from the transportation request form on source and destination should no longer be of much value since
the Commission has required pipelines to provide for flexible receipt and delivery points. By making use of alternate
receipt or delivery points, shippers will be able to transport gas between a variety of sources and destinations,
regardless of the source or destination information provided on the transportation request form. The Commission,
however, is retaining the requirement that pipelines post the quantity of gas at each delivery point for discounts
actually granted.

 A commenter had requested additional protection against affiliate abuse, contending that, after unbundling, a
pipeline could avoid the Order No. 497 requirement to post transportation discounts by charging its affiliate the
maximum transportation rate to deliver the gas, but selling gas to its affiliate at a loss. As part of its response,
the Commission stated that concealment of such an arrangement would be difficult in light of the &sect;250.16(b)(2)(xiv)
requirement for pipelines to report whether affiliated marketers or their blanket sales operating units were selling
gas below cost.

However, after further consideration and review of experience under Order No. 497, the Commission is proposing to
eliminate the sales below cost provision, because it has not proved meaningful in evaluating discounts granted by
pipelines. The Commission understands the pipelines obtain the information on below cost sales from the affiliated
marketer in its initial request for service. The information reported by the pipeline, therefore, would not provide
current below cost sales information that can be directly related to the current transportation arrangements posted
in the log. Experience also shows that 98% of the time pipelines report this information as ``no'' or ``unknown''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has no evidence that the manipulation of gas and transportation prices, as suggested by the comment
in Order No. 636&hyph;A, has occurred or resulted in discrimination. Moreover, the Commission seriously doubts
whether, in the competitive market for gas sales, any pipeline reporting requirement would permit monitoring of
the ever-changing price which shippers, whether affiliated marketers or others, will be paying for gas. Shippers
in the market are in a better position to obtain information on gas prices and to file complaints with the Commission
if they believe a manipulation of gas and transportation prices results in an undue discrimination relating to the
transportation component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also is proposing to clarify the reporting requirements by requiring the provision of information
on whether an affiliate or sales operating unit is involved in the transportation transaction and its role. Current
&sect;250.16(b)(2) (revised &sect;250.16(d)) already requires pipelines to report transactions in which an affiliated
marketer is involved, even if it is not the shipper. For example, an affiliate or pipeline sales operating unit could
be involved in a transaction as a seller of gas or as an agent, but not as the shipper. The requirement to report the extent
of such involvement would ensure that those obtaining the affiliate information would know the role of the pipeline
affiliate when it is not a shipper.

The existing regulations require pipelines to file transportation logs at the Commission. The Commission is proposing

 The Commission similarly required the pipelines to maintain nonaffiliate information in electronic form and to
provide this information to the Commission upon request or to the public under the Commission's discovery procedures.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since pipelines are now required to comply with the Part 284 EBB requirements for posting of the affiliate information,
they must make this information available through downloadable files. The regulations have been revised to reflect
this requirement.

The Commission is also proposing to modify the requirements for providing both affiliate and nonaffiliate information
to the Commission upon request. Under the proposal, pipelines would only have to maintain the information and be prepared
to make it available electronically within a reasonable time upon request, according to specifications and formats
promulgated by the Commission. Under the proposal, pipelines would not have to maintain the nonaffiliate information
in one computer file. They could maintain the information in different files so long as they could extract the information
and provide it, upon request, in electronic form. The Commission proposes to revise Form No. 592 to set forth the specifications
and formats to be used for downloading and for providing the information to the Commission upon request.

Current &sect;250.16(d)(4)(ii) provides that filing the discounted rate report for affiliate transactions within
15 days of the close of the billing period satisfies a pipeline's obligation to file discount reports under &sect;284.7(d)(5)(iv).
Since pipelines are no longer required routinely to file transportation logs with the Commission, they must now fully
comply with &sect;284.7(d)(5)(iv) for affiliate transactions.

IV. Sunset Date
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is not proposing to include a sunset provision in this rule. The proposed revisions reduce the compliance
burden significantly, and a firm sunset date, such as one year from issuance, would not necessarily provide sufficient
time for the Commission fully to evaluate the effect of Order No. 636 on the pipelines' incentive to favor affiliates.
The Commission always can reevaluate the rule when sufficient information is available. For example, after evaluation
of the impact of the capacity release mechanism, the Commission may find that the availability of released capacity
has so reduced the significance of interruptible discounts from the pipeline that the regulations are no longer needed.
But, the Commission cannot predict when it would have sufficient data to make such a determination. The Commission
notes that even without a sunset provision, it must review these regulations within three years because the Paperwork
Reduction Act does not permit OMB to approve an information collection requirement for a period in excess of three
years.

V. Environmental Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is required to prepare an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement for any action
that may have a significant adverse effect on the human environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from these requirements as not having a significant effect
on the human environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
32
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The action taken here falls within categorical exclusions provided in the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
33
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

The information required under FERC&hyph;592 enables the Commission to carry out its legislative mandate under
the NGA and NGPA and will help ensure a viable capacity release market under the Commission's Order No. 636. Specifically,
the required information allows the Commission to review/monitor pipeline transportation, sales, and storage
transactions with its marketing affiliates to deter undue discrimination and to take appropriate action, where
and when necessary. The information is also used by others to indicate whether or not there has been discrimination
in pipeline/affiliate/nonaffiliate transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is submitting notification of these FERC&hyph;592 information requirements to OMB for its review
and approval. Interested persons may obtain further information by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division,
(202) 208&hyph;1415]. Comments on the requirements of the subject proposed rule may also be sent to the Office of Information

A. Affiliate Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The required Form No. 592 information for interruptible transportation/storage service must be publicly available
on an electronic bulletin board (EBB) which satisfies the pipeline's obligations under Order No. 636. This Form No.
592 data/information is also required to be downloadable in ASCII flat files conforming with the specifications
of these instructions and record formats.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement for back-up, archive, and retrieval of the Form No. 592 interruptible transportation/storage information
on the EBB is the same as for information posted pursuant to &sect;284.8(b)(4). Each affiliate interruptible transportation/storage
transaction must be posted for a 90 day period. EBB functionality shall be provided to permit users to extract currently
posted Form No. 592 data, for one or more months, and to download a flat file containing this material formatted in accordance
with these instructions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Pipelines must have the capability to create flat files containing the Form No. 592 interruptible transportation/storage
information, for a specified time period, for both pipeline affiliates and nonaffiliates. For discovery, the Commission
may require pipelines to submit these Form No. 592 flat files for both affiliates and nonaffiliates on 9-track tape
reel(s), 18-track tape cartridges(s), or on computer diskette(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pipeline may also be requested to provide one paper copy of the information submitted on the magnetic tape(s) or
diskette(s) formatted so as to assist Commission staff in reading the company's flat files. The paper copy, if requested,
must cover the same time period as the flat files submitted on the magnetic tape(s) or diskette(s).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
General Instructions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The notation f(m,n) will be used to denote a numeric string of length ``m'' including a decimal (``.'') with ``n''
digits following the decimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In preparing the required flat file, the following conventions must be followed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) All numeric fields must not be left blank and must be right justified unless indicated otherwise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) All money items should be rounded to the nearest dollar except where noted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) All volumetric data should be stated in MMbtu's (rounded to the nearest MMbtu), except where noted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) All rates should be stated in cents per MMbtu fixed decimal numbers, format f(10,2). For example, $1.5264/MMbtu
should be stated as 152.64. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Negative values should be reported with a ``^'' sign preceding the first nonzero digit reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) Commas must not be included in any numeric field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) Percents should be reported as whole numbers between 0 and 100 inclusive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H) All dates should be reported as six digit numerics (year, month, day), unless otherwise indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The sequence number is the sequential number assigned to a record as it is recorded on a schedule/record. The sequence
number is incremented as additional records are added to a schedule/record and will be between 1 and 999,999, inclusive.
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The sequence number should be right justified, zero filled.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The reference number is the alphanumeric string formed by concatenation of the Schedule ID, Record ID, sequence
number, and item location number. E.g., a respondent's Company ID reported in the first record on the ``General Information''
record would have reference number ``X101000001011'' formed by joining (concatenating) the schedule ID ``X1'',
the record ID ``01'', the sequence number ``000001'', and the item location number ``011''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Report any footnote relative to any item reported on Schedule X1 in the ``Footnotes Record'', (Record 06 of Schedule
X1). Each footnote should be cross referenced to the schedule and record (line) it pertains to by the appropriate reference
number. E.g., a footnote for Company ID reported in the first record of the ``General Information'' record, (Schedule
X1, Record 01), would be recorded in the ``Footnote Record,'' (Schedule X1, Record 06), using the reference number
``X101000001011''. At a minimum, the respondent should report the following information, in footnotes, for each
contract/ request reported in the ``Transportation Service Data Record,'' (Schedule X1, Record 02). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The field ``Respondent Affiliation,'' item number 15, should be footnoted to provide a complete list of personnel
and facilities shared by the interstate pipeline and affiliated marketer or broker, or by the interstate pipeline
and its blanket sales operating unit. Negative reports are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The field ``Disposition of Request,'' item number 11, should be footnoted to provide any complaints and the disposition
of such complaints by the shipper or end user concerning the requested or furnished service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Source of codes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Pipeline Company ID: Use the code for the pipeline as contained in the Buyer Seller Code List, U.S. Department of
Energy's publication DOE/EIA&hyph;0176. A code may be obtained by calling EIA at (202) 254&hyph;5435. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Contract ID: The respondent's own designation for the contract or agreement covering the transaction being reported.
This identifier will either be assigned by the respondent or the party providing a service to the respondent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A pipeline blanket sales operating unit is any entity operating under a subpart J of part 284 blanket sales certificate,
and is considered the functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate.

OSM published a proposed rule on November 8, 1993 (58 FR 59334), that would revise the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) regulations
in 30 CFR chapter VII, subchapter R to ensure that they will be consistent with agency practice and all past amendments
to Title IV of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The specific changes proposed to the AML rules are set
forth in the November 8, 1993,

The comment period for the proposed rule was scheduled to close on January 7, 1994. However, an extension of the comment
period was requested in order to provide more time in which to comment on the proposed rule. Therefore, OSM is extending
the comment period. Comments will now be accepted until 5 p.m. local time on March 8, 1994.

SUMMARY:

 USEPA is proposing to disapprove the State of Wisconsin's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Rules,
Natural Resources (NR) 405.01 through 405.17, as a revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan (SIP). The
State developed the rules as Wisconsin's plan to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in areas designated
as unclassifiable or attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and to satisfy the requirements
of part C of the Clean Air Act (Act). USEPA proposes to disapprove these rules because they do not meet USEPA's regulation
governing State PSD programs (40 CFR 51.166). Until USEPA approves a SIP submission from Wisconsin satisfying these
requirements, the Federal PSD requirements at 40 CFR 52.21 remain applicable within the State of Wisconsin.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act added part C to title I, which required implementation of a PSD program. On June
19, 1978 USEPA promulgated a PSD program to meet the requirements of part C. It promulgated 40 CFR 51.24 (now 40 CFR 51.166),
which listed the requirements a State must meet in order to have a State PSD program approved as a part of its SIP. It promulgated
40 CFR 52.21, which contains the procedures and requirements which USEPA follows when it carries out the mandates
of part C itself. These &sect;52.21 requirements were then promulgated into those State SIPs where a State did not
have an approvable plan in place. Section 52.21 provides that its requirements and authorities, or parts thereof,
can be delegated to the State and local air programs if USEPA determines they have the ability and authority to carry
out its mandates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 On June 19, 1978 (43 FR 26410), USEPA promulgated the Federal PSD program, 40 CFR 52.21(b) through (v), into the Wisconsin
SIP at 40 CFR 52.2581 because Wisconsin had not submitted an approvable PSD program. On August 19, 1980 USEPA gave Wisconsin
partial delegation to run the Federal PSD Program and on November 13, 1987 gave Wisconsin full delegation of the program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seeking a SIP approval of the State's PSD Program, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted
its PSD rules, NR 405.01 through NR 405.17, to USEPA as a revision to its SIP on March 16, 1987. A further revision to these
rules, which addresses oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), was submitted on November 24, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wisconsin NR 405 deals exclusively with PSD permitting requirements.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 USEPA evaluated NR 405 by comparing each section of the rule to the appropriate paragraph of 40 CFR 51.166 (formerly
40 CFR 51.24). Although Wisconsin's PSD rules essentially incorporated the Federal PSD provisions in 40 CFR 51.166,
USEPA's evaluation revealed deficiencies relative to references to New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), National
Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), federally issued PSD permits, source-specific allowable
emissions, and modeling guidelines.

Chapter NR 405 applies the PSD regulation within the total area of the State of Wisconsin. Court decisions have determined
that State governments do not have jurisdiction over most Indian lands. This in itself does not affect USEPA's proposal
to disapprove the rule, but would have to be addressed by Wisconsin if it submitted a revised rule.

A. NSPS and NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal PSD definitions at 40 CFR 51.166 pertaining to: (1) ``Best Available Control Technology'' (BACT), (2)
``Allowable emissions'', (3) ``Federally enforceable'', and (4) the control technology review requirements make
reference to applicable standards and standards of performance under 40 CFR part 60 (NSPS) and 40 CFR part 61 (NESHAP),
respectively. In the comparable provisions of the State rule, the State refers to other NR 400 series chapters, i.e.,
NR 440, 445 to 499, and 400 to 499 of the State code. Although the State may have intended that these chapters approximate
the requirements of 40 CFR parts 60 and 61, Wisconsin's NSPS and NESHAP regulations are not federally enforceable
and may, in certain circumstances, differ significantly from the parts 60 and 61 requirements in the Federal PSD requirements.
The references to parts 60 and 61 in the Federal PSD requirements for BACT and control technology review (&sect;&sect;51.166(b)(12)
and 51.166(j)(1), respectively) set minimum emissions requirements. Because the State can set less stringent NSPS
and NESHAP emission limits than the Federal standards, or not set any limits at all, the State PSD provisions which
are dependent upon the requirements of Chapter 440 and Chapters 445 to 449 are not approvable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Stack Height 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions in 40 CFR part 51, subpart I_``Revision of New Sources and Modifications'' set forth both general and
specific requirements for permitting PSD sources, including definitions. In order for the State to implement the
stack height provision in accordance with 40 CFR 51.164 and 51.166(h), it must have definitions of such terms as ``stack'',
``dispersion technique'', and ``good engineering practice''. On November 6, 1985, the State submitted a letter
stating that permits issued for new or modified sources will conform with the requirements with the Stack Height Regulation,
as set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 8, 1985, until such time that the State promulgates its own rule. As submitted, this provision meets the stack
height requirements of the PSD program, and USEPA approved Wisconsin's commitment on August 4, 1989 (54 FR 32074),
as a portion of Wisconsin's stack height plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Federally Issued PSD Permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the State's definition of ``major modifications'', NR 405.02(21)(b)(6), the rule exempts an increase in hours
of operation or in production rates from review unless such increases are prohibited by permits issued after January
6, 1975, under NR 405. This rule is deficient for not requiring review of sources with such increases if the increases
were prohibited by previously issued Federal permits or during the period when EPA issued the permits prior to the
delegation of the program's authority. The State rule only exempts from the exclusion those permits with conditions
``pursuant to this chapter'', which is in the Wisconsin rule. There is no requirement for review of modifications
to federally issued permits with exemptions pursuant to 40 CFR 52.21. As submitted, this provision is not approvable
as a PSD rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Source-Specific Allowable Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NR 405.02(1) contains the term ``source-specific allowable emissions''. The meaning of the term is unclear. The
Federal rule depends upon the preamble language published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 7, 1980 (Vol. 45, No. 154), to qualify the term to exclude cases where data on actual emissions are available.
The language in NR 405.02(1) would have to be clarified so that the State term has the same meaning as the Federal term.
This provision is not approvable in its present form.

E. PSD Increments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State PSD increments for sulfur dioxide and particulate matter are found in Chapter NR 404.05. The increments
were not included in Wisconsin's March 16, 1987 PSD SIP submittal, but were included in its November 24, 1992 submittal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Modeling Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The modeling guidelines referenced in NR 405.10 are now outmoded, although they were current at the time of submittal.
To make NR 405.10 approvable, it would either have to reference the most recent guidelines (See 40 CFR 165(l)) or state
that the applicant must use USEPA's most current applicable guideline models. Although the modeling guidelines
were current at the time of submittal, this deficiency would need to be addressed if Wisconsin were to resubmit the
rule as a SIP revision.

H. Particulate Matter (PM) Significant Level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24713), USEPA promulgated the significant level for PM at 15 tons per year. Wisconsin submitted
two PM SIP revisions on March 13, 1989 and May 10, 1990 to meet the Federal PM requirements. These submittals were proposed
for approval on March 13, 1989 (NR 400.02, 404.02, 405.02, 406.04, 484.03) which contain the PM significant level,
and May 10, 1990 (NR 404.04, 484.03). USEPA then proposed to disapprove the package on December 23, 1992. After receiving
comments from the State, USEPA moved to approve the package. The final rulemaking approving these rules was published
on June 28, 1993 (58 FR 34528).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the deficiencies noted above, USEPA is proposing to disapprove Wisconsin's Prevention of Significant
Deterioration Permit Program as not meeting the requirements of part C of the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency reviewed this PSD SIP revision request for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted
on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action did not conform with the statute before it was amended,
that the Amendments did not in any way affect this determination, and that the revision does not conform to the Act,
as amended. If resubmitted, Wisconsin's PSD SIP submission should include all requirements and changes added by
the 1990 Amendments. Thus, USEPA is proposing that the revision be disapproved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C., section 605(b), I certify that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities (see 46 FR 8709). If USEPA were to disapprove this rule, its disapproval
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because USEPA's PSD program
remains in effect under delegated authority. Sources would remain subject to the same requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12291, this action is not ``Major''. It has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) for review.

Reply Comment Date: February 9, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By the Chief Engineer:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. On December 23, 1993, the Cable-Consumer Electronics Compatibility Advisory Group (Advisory Group) requested
that the time for filing comments to the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) in the above-captioned proceeding be
extended from January 10, 1994 to January 25, 1994 and that the reply comment date be extended from January 25, 1994
to February 9, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In its request, the Advisory Group indicates that a 15 day extension of the comment periods would increase the chances
that the cable and consumer electronics industries, though the Advisory Group, will be able to prepare a joint filing
that help to narrow the issues in dispute between those industries and should increase the quality of such joint submission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Commission does not routinely grant extensions of time.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In this instance, however, we believe that extending the comment deadline by 15 days will serve the public interest
by providing the cable and consumer electronics industries additional opportunity to reach a consensus on the proposals
set forth in the NPRM and should result in a improved record being submitted to the Commission. We also believe it is
in the public interest to extend the reply comment deadline correspondingly. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
it is ordered 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
That the deadline for filing comments is extended to January 25, 1994, and the deadline for filing reply comments is
extended to February 9, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Authorization Act of 1991 directs this agency to initiate rulemaking
to consider the need for any additional brake performance standards for passenger cars, including antilock brake
standards. Pursuant to this mandate, the agency is issuing this notice to obtain responses to questions regarding
the braking performance of passenger cars and other light vehicles and the need to require antilock brake systems
on these vehicles. This notice poses questions about the desirability of a requirement that light vehicles be equipped
with antilock brake systems (ABS), including questions about such a requirement's anticipated safety benefits,
potential regulatory approaches and anticipated performance requirements and test procedures, the requirement's
applicability, its schedule for implementation, and the anticipated costs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hydraulic Brake Systems, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
specifies requirements for vehicles equipped with hydraulic brake systems. (49 CFR 571.105). Standard No. 105 applies
to all vehicles except motorcycles that are equipped with hydraulic brakes. It has specific requirements which apply
to passenger cars and to vehicles other than passenger cars with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) (1) equal to or
less than 10,000 pounds and (2) greater than 10,000 pounds.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The Standard's purpose is to ensure safe braking performance under normal and emergency conditions. The Standard
includes a variety of performance requirements that evaluate a vehicle's service brake system in terms of stopping
distance, partial failure, fade and recovery, water recovery, and spike stops. It also sets forth requirements related
to a vehicle's parking brake performance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
None of NHTSA's safety standards currently mandates the installation of antilock braking systems (ABS) on light
vehicles or specifies performance requirements intended to ensure the proper functioning of an ABS voluntarily
installed on a light vehicle. A light vehicle equipped with an ABS is required to meet the same stopping distance requirements
as a non-ABS-equipped light vehicle. In addition, a light vehicle with a failed ABS must be capable of meeting the stopping
distance requirements for partial failure of the service brake system, as follows: passenger cars are required to
stop within 456 feet and other light vehicles must stop within 517 feet when traveling at 60 mph on a high coefficient
of friction surface. (See section S5.5 of Standard No. 105).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has proposed requirements for functioning and failed ABSs. NHTSA is currently reviewing comments to a supplemental
notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) that proposes to establish a new standard, Standard No. 135, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Passenger Car Brake Systems
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which would replace Standard No. 105 as it applies to passenger cars. (56 FR 30528, July 3, 1991). The rulemaking to
establish the new standard resulted from NHTSA's efforts to harmonize its safety standards with international standards.
The agency anticipates the next regulatory action related to Standard No. 135 will be issued in early 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the SNPRM, NHTSA proposed requirements for functioning antilock systems, which include straight line stops on
high and low coefficient of friction surfaces, a high coefficient of friction to low coefficient of friction surface
transition test, and a low coefficient of friction to high coefficient of friction surface transition test. A high
coefficient of friction surface, such as dry asphalt, is one that is relatively sticky and thus provides higher levels
of braking force and better lateral stability and control during braking. Conversely, a low coefficient of friction
surface, such as wet or icy pavement, is one that is relatively slippery and thus provides lower levels of braking force
and poorer lateral stability and control during braking. These surfaces are referred to as high mu and low mu surfaces,
respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also proposed requirements for failed antilock systems, which are more stringent than Standard No. 105's
antilock failure requirements. For an antilock functional failure, the agency proposed a stopping distance of 85
meters (279 feet) from 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph).

B. Statutory Mandate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 2500 through 2509 of the ``Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991'' are called the ``National
Highway Traffice Safety Administration Authorization Act of 1991'' (``Authorization Act''). Among other things,
the Authorization Act directs NHTSA to initiate rulemaking on a number of safety matters, including brake performance
standards for passenger cars.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's ANPRM initiates the rulemaking required by section 2507 of the Authorization Act. That section provides
that, not later than December 31, 1993, an advance notice of proposed rulemaking be published, in accordance with
the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, to consider the need for any additional brake performance
standards for passenger cars, including ABS standards. The Act also directs the agency to ``consider any such [antilock
brake system] adopted by a manufacturer'' to facilitate and encourage innovation and early application of economical
and effective antilock brake systems for all such vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2507 requires the rulemaking action to be completed not later than 36 months from issuance of the ANPRM. Under
sections 2507 and 2052(b)(2)(B)(ii), the action will be considered completed when the agency either promulgates
a final rule or decides not to promulgate a rule.

C. Antilock Brake Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary benefit of an ABS is its ability to prevent loss-of-control accidents caused by wheel lockup during braking.
This allows the driver to maintain steering control and lateral stability even in panic braking situations. In addition,
vehicles equipped with an ABS typically have enhanced braking efficiency and as a consequence usually have shorter
stopping distances, particularly on low mu surfaces, compared to the same vehicle without an ABS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ABSs help prevent braking induced loss-of-control situations by automatically controlling the amount of braking
pressure applied to a wheel. Current antilock braking systems include wheel speed sensors that measure wheel speeds
and transmit signals to an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The ECU monitors wheel speeds, and changes in wheel speeds,
based on electrical signals transmitted from sensors located at the wheels or within the axle housings. If the wheels
start to lock, the ECU signals a modulator control valve to actuate, thereby holding constant or reducing the amount
of braking pressure applied to the wheel or axle that is nearing lockup. This continuous feedback cycle of sensing,
controlling, modulating, and sensing prevents wheel lockup, and results in improved vehicle stability and steering
control during braking on all types of road surface conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two primary types of ABS configurations that are currently available for most light vehicles: all-wheel
systems and rear-wheel-only systems. An all-wheel ABS directly controls all the wheels on the vehicle, typically
by using individual wheel control for the front axle wheels and either individual wheel control or select low control
for the rear axle wheels. (Select low control provides the same brake pressure modulation to both wheels of an axle
whenever either wheel on that axle approaches lockup.) A vehicle equipped with an all-wheel ABS is able to maintain
steering control, even during hard braking on wet surfaces. Because maintaining steering control can be a key factor
in accident avoidance, a vehicle equipped with an all-wheel ABS would be expected to experience better lateral stability
and control during hard braking, particularly on wet or slippery road surface conditions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rear-wheel-only ABSs directly control only the rear wheels of the vehicle, using the select low method of control.
A vehicle equipped with a rear-wheel-only ABS may still experience front wheel lockup during braking, since the front
wheels are not controlled by the ABS. Rear-wheel-only systems have relatively less accident reduction potential
than all-wheel systems, because front wheel lockup could result in a vehicle losing steering control. In a crash-threatening
situation, maintaining steering control can be a critical factor in accident avoidance.

D. Current Size of ABS Market
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ABSs are currently available on over 130 models of passenger cars and other light vehicles (light trucks and vans (LTVs),
and sport utility vehicles). ABSs are offered as standard equipment on almost all top-of-the line models and as standard
equipment or an option on an increasing number of mid-priced and low-priced models. For instance, the Chevrolet Cavalier
with a manufacturer's suggested retail price of under $10,000 offers an ABS as standard equipment. Manufacturers
of ABSs currently available on vehicles sold in the United States include Bendix, Bosch, Dewandre-WABCO, GM-Delco,
Honda, Kelsey-Hayes, Nippondenso, Sumitomo, and Teves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, 2,682,218 of the passenger cars sold in the United States were equipped with an ABS. This represented approximately
32 percent of all passenger cars sold in this country during that year. Passenger cars that are equipped with an ABS
typically have an all-wheel ABS that permits steering control since the system modulates the brake force at each wheel.
That same year, approximately 3,600,000 of the other light vehicles sold in the United States were equipped with an
ABS, and approximately 3,100,000 of those vehicles were equipped with a rear-wheel-only ABS. While rear-wheel-only
systems provide benefits (e.g., improved stability during braking) for light trucks that frequently experience
a wide range of loading levels, a rear-wheel-only ABS provides no ABS control to the front wheels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These nearly 6,300,000 ABS-equipped passenger cars and light trucks represented 49 percent of the 12.8 million light
vehicles sold in the United States in 1992. Based on reports from industry, NHTSA estimates that over 75 percent of
all new passenger cars and other light vehicles will be equipped with an ABS by 1996.

II. NHTSA Activities Related to Braking Performance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the years, NHTSA has studied the effectiveness of ABSs in avoiding crashes and reducing their severity. The agency
conducted the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tri-Level Study of the Causes of Traffic Accidents,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (DOT HS 801&hyph;631, Final Report, June 1975) to determine the effectiveness of ABSs. While this is not a recent study,
its conclusions might still be relevant. Among these conclusions are that (1) rear-wheel-only ABSs had an accident
reduction potential of one to four percent, (2) four wheel ABSs provide the greatest safety benefits and could reduce
accidents by eight to 15 percent, (3) an ABS's ability to maintain control was found to be a more important safety attribute
than its ability to improve stopping distance performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has also conducted test track evaluations of ABS equipped light vehicles. (Hiltner, Arehart, and Radlinski,
``Light Vehicle ABS Performance Evaluation,'' DOT HS 807 813, December 1991; and ``Light Vehicle ABS Performance
Evaluation_Phase II,'' DOT HS 807 924, May 1992.) The December 1991 report describes tests conducted on ten light
vehicles to evaluate the improvement in braking performance and vehicle stability and control resulting from each
vehicle's ABS. The test program's purpose was to show the degree to which an ABS improves a given vehicle's brake performance,
not to compare vehicles or similar ABSs to one another. Therefore, each vehicle was tested with the ABS ``on'' and with
the ABS ``off'' or disabled. Eight of the ten vehicles were equipped with an all-wheel ABS. Each vehicle was run through
a set of eighteen separate test conditions, using both panic stops and driver-best-effort stops in both the empty
and loaded condition at speeds of 35 mph and 60 mph. Braking maneuvers consisted of straight line stops on a uniform
surface, straight line stops on a split mu surface, stops in a 500 foot curve, and stops involving lane changes. The
tests were conducted at 35, 45, 50, and 60 mph, at both the empty and loaded weight conditions. The tests were conducted
on a variety of surfaces, including wet Jennite, gravel, and dry concrete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the findings in the December 1991 report were that (1) each ABS, and especially the all-wheel systems, improved
the vehicle's lateral stability during panic braking; (2) the all-wheel systems shortened stopping distances on
most hard paved surfaces, with improvements of up to 25 percent on wet concrete and up to 50 percent on wet Jennite; (3)
each ABS lengthened the vehicle's stopping distances in panic stops on gravel, with increases exceeding 25 percent
in some cases; and (4) the rear-wheel system enhanced the vehicle's lateral stability but did not reduce stopping
distances in most panic brake applications.

The May 1992 report describes tests conducted on eight light vehicles to evaluate how the ABS influenced vehicle stopping
distance and lateral stability and control on various surfaces. This evaluation supplements the December 1991 program
by testing different vehicles on more slippery test surfaces, although it only used straight line maneuvers. Among
the report's findings were that (1) with one exception, the seven vehicles with all-wheel systems were under complete
directional control during the tests with the ABS ``on,'' (2) the vehicle with a rear-wheel-only ABS generally provided
improved, but not complete, lateral stability and control, (3) ABSs improved stopping performance on all surfaces,
except that stopping distance worsened on dry gravel surfaces, and (4) no vehicle experienced problems in the high
to low mu transition testing with the ABS operational.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has recently published two proposals related to the braking performance of medium and heavy vehicles (hereinafter
referred to as ``heavy vehicles''). On February 23, 1993, the agency proposed reinstating stopping distance requirements
for these vehicles. (58 FR 11003). In addition, on September 28, 1993, the agency published a proposal that would require
heavy vehicles to be equipped with an ABS to improve the lateral stability and control of these vehicles during braking.
(58 FR 50738). The ABS requirement would be supplemented by a 30 mph braking-in-a-curve ``check'' test conducted
on a low coefficient of friction surface using a full, panic brake application. Some of the issues raised in these rulemakings,
such as the test surface and the proposed definition of ``ABS,'' are relevant to this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This ANPRM discusses whether the agency should propose to require ABS for light vehicles, pursuant to the mandate
in ISTEA. While manufacturers are equipping an increasingly large number of light vehicles with ABS, it appears that
it would be quite a few years, if ever, before all light vehicles would voluntarily be equipped with such devices. Based
on the agency's review of comments to this notice and its review of additional accident data and other information,
NHTSA will determine whether it should propose to require that all light vehicles be equipped with ABSs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This ANPRM also makes a number of requests for data and information. The agency wishes to emphasize that since this
is an ANPRM, no rule will be issued on this specific subject without first issuing an ANPRM to provide further opportunity
to comment. In commenting on a particular matter on responding to a particular question, interested persons are requested
to provide any relevant factual information to support their conclusions or opinions, including but not limited
to, testing, statistical, and cost data, and the source of such information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency seeks comments about the following topics:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The anticipated safety benefits from requiring light vehicles to be equipped with ABSs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Potential regulatory approaches to improve the lateral stability and control of light vehicles during braking,
including a requirement for an ABS and any anticipated performance requirements and test procedures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The types of light vehicles to which these requirements would apply and whether all vehicles should be required
to be equipped with an all-wheel ABS;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A schedule for implementing the ABS requirements to maximize their benefits at reasonable costs; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The costs of requiring light vehicles to be equipped with antilock braking systems that would comply with the anticipated
requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For ease of reference, the questions below are numbered consecutively. The agency requests that commenters identify
each answer they give by the number of each question being answered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Safety Need
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The threshold issue in deciding whether to amend an existing safety standard concerns the requirement's safety need.
NHTSA is reviewing accident data, including information from the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS), NHTSA's
General Estimates System (GES), the National Accident Sampling System (NASS), and State accident data files. This
review focuses on the benefits achieved by equipping light vehicles with an ABS in a variety of different crash modes.
Among the crash modes being studied are (1) single vehicle run-off-the-road crashes in which skidding or spinning
was the vehicle's pre-crash stability condition, (2) multi-vehicle crashes resulting from a vehicle's loss-of-control
or inability-to-stop-in-time, and (3) crashes in which a vehicle strikes pedestrians, animals, or road objects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial data from these sources indicate that braking induced loss-of-control crashes and inability-to-stop-in-time
crashes are frequent types of crashes that warrant further study. Such crashes are especially prevalent on wet or
slippery roads, a condition in which ABSs would be effective. Eleven percent of all fatal crashes in 1991 occurred
on wet or slippery roads, and 18 percent of property-damage-only crashes occurred under such conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA's research test findings indicate that equipping light vehicles with an ABS would be beneficial to safety.
The primary benefit with equipping light vehicles with an ABS is that a driver is better able to maintain vehicle stability
and steering control during crash-threatening braking situations. A secondary, but still important benefit with
an ABS, is that a vehicle's stopping ability is improved on some surfaces.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA's preliminary evaluation of rear-wheel antilock brake systems indicates that such ABSs on light trucks are
particularly effective in reducing the number of run-off-road crashes. Analyses of State accident files found that
rear-wheel ABS was effective in reducing the risk of such nonfatal rollovers (and side and frontal impacts with fixed
objects) for almost every type of truck, under any type of road condition. Reductions of rollovers were typically
in the 30&hyph;40 percent range, reductions of side impacts with fixed objects in the 15&hyph;30 percent range, and
reductions in frontal impacts with fixed objects in the 5&hyph;20 percent range. The risk of collisions with pedestrians,
animals, bicycles, trains, or on-road objects was also significantly reduced, by about 5&hyph;15 percent. A copy
of this preliminary evaluation is available in the public docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is continuing to analyze the data and a comprehensive report of the findings will be published at a later date.
In the meantime, the agency requests additional information on braking induced loss-of-control crashes and inability-to-stop-in-time
crashes from rental fleets, corporate fleets, insurance companies, police officers, and others. This information
would assist the agency in its efforts to quantify the benefits from ABSs. Accordingly, the agency requests comments
from these organizations and others about their experiences in which drivers of light vehicles have lost control
during braking or been unable to stop before a crash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With these considerations in mind, the agency poses the following questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Based on the available data, what safety benefits would result from the issuance of requirements to prevent or minimize
the effect of braking induced loss-of-control crashes or inability-to-stop-in-time crashes? In what types of crashes
would these benefits occur? Please provide estimates in terms of accidents, injuries, and fatalities prevented.
The agency also requests quantitative estimates of reductions in property damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What additional injury and non-injury data and other information exist about real-world crashes and near crashes
involving drivers of light vehicles who skidded or otherwise lost control?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. At the time of loss-of-control or inability-to-stop-in-time crashes, what were the driving conditions and weather
environment? At what speed was the vehicle traveling? Was the roadway dry, wet, or icy? To what degree did these adverse
driving conditions contribute to the crash and its severity? Did the crash occur on an interstate, secondary highway,
or residential road? What, if any, crash avoidance maneuver precipitated the crash?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. With respect to loss-of-control or inability-to-stop-in-time crashes known to the commenter, would equipping
the vehicle with an ABS or a more effective ABS (e.g., an all-wheel system instead of a rear-wheel-only system) have
helped in avoiding any of the crashes or reducing their severity?

5. With respect to fleets that have switched or begun switching to ABS-equipped light vehicles, have the ABS-equipped

If NHTSA were to propose amending its braking safety standards to improve the lateral stability and control of light
vehicles during braking, the amendment would have to meet the Vehicle Safety Act's criteria that the requirement
be practicable and be stated in objective terms (section 103(a)). Any rulemaking addressing antilock would also
be guided by the findings in

held that objective test methods and more probative and convincing data evidencing the reliability and safety of
vehicles that are equipped with antilock and in use must be available before the agency can enforce a standard requiring
its installation.

6. In the NPRM addressing lateral stability and control for heavy vehicles, NHTSA proposed that each heavy vehicle
be equipped with an antilock braking system that satisfies the agency's proposed definition of ``ABS.'' In addition,
as a ``check'' on the performance of the ABS, the agency proposed that a heavy vehicle would have to comply with a braking-in-a-curve
test. The agency tentatively concluded that this approach would ensure that heavy vehicles would be able to significantly
improve their lateral stability and control during braking.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is considering applying this approach to light vehicles by proposing both a requirement mandating the installation
of ABSs on light vehicles and road tests that serve as a check on the performance of the ABS. The agency requests comments
about the possible benefits and shortcomings of using this approach for light vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In developing the proposed definition for ``ABS'' in the heavy vehicle rulemaking, NHTSA referred to the definitions
of ``ABS'' adopted by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and the Economic Commission for Europe's (ECE) Regulation
13, Annex 13 (1988). Based on these definitions and other considerations, the agency proposed the following definition
of ``antilock brake system'' in the heavy vehicle rulemaking:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
a portion of a service brake system that automatically controls the degree of rotational wheel slip during braking
by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) sensing the rate of angular rotation of the wheels;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) transmitting signals regarding the rate of wheel angular rotation to one or more devices which interpret those
signals and generate responsive controlling output signals; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) transmitting those controlling signals to one or more devices which adjust brake actuating forces in response
to those signals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this definition describing fundamental and necessary performance aspects that any braking system must have
to be considered an ABS, the agency believes that any ABS would be permitted, provided that it is a ``closed loop'' system
that ensures feedback between what is actually happening at the tire-road surface interface and what the device is
doing to respond to impending wheel lockup.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency requests comments about whether to apply to light vehicles the approach proposed to improve the lateral
stability and control of heavy vehicles. Is it necessary and appropriate to supplement the combination of a definition
of ``ABS'' and an equipment requirement with one or more ``check'' tests to ensure the lateral stability and control
of light vehicles? Is the definition of ``ABS,'' as proposed in the heavy vehicle NPRM, appropriate for light vehicles?
What are the advantages or disadvantages of a requirement expressly mandating an ABS instead of taking the more indirect
approach of adopting dynamic tests? Notwithstanding the agency's tentative conclusion that the proposed definition
for heavy vehicle ``ABS'' is sufficiently broad to allow a variety of ABSs, the agency welcomes comment about the use
of this definition for light vehicles. Would it ensure suitable stopping distances and cover all appropriate brake
designs, while not unnecessarily prohibiting brake systems that effectively prevent wheel lockup in a sufficiently
wide variety of circumstances?

8. In the heavy vehicle ABS rulemaking, NHTSA proposed that such vehicles would have to comply with a braking-in-a-curve
test, but decided not to propose additional tests such as a split mu test or a lane change test. The agency believed that
such additional tests would be impracticable for heavy vehicles given the criteria set forth in

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is considering additional tests for light vehicle antilock systems for three reasons. First, ABS requirements
on passenger cars were originally developed in proposals for Standard No. 135, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Passenger Car Brake Systems, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which are based on the effort to harmonize braking standards with EEC and ECE requirements. These proposals included
split mu tests and surface transition tests. Second, the agency believes that light vehicle ABS may need to have a higher
level of capability for some aspects of performance than heavy vehicle ABS. For instance, the antilock systems on
heavy vehicles do not have to be as quick as the systems on light vehicles in responding to impending wheel lock. The
wheel lockup allowed by light vehicle antilock systems available today is about 0.2 seconds, compared with a lockup
duration closer to one second for heavy vehicle systems. This is so because heavy vehicles typically have a longer
wheel base than light vehicles, and a high vehicle moment of inertia about the vertical axis. On these vehicles, yaw
movement during braking with ABS on a split mu surface or during a braking-in-a-curve maneuver takes place at a relatively
slower rate than on light vehicles, primarily because of the higher vehicle moment of inertia. Third, in contrast
to testing light vehicles, the availability of test facilities and the safety of the tests would make more extensive
testing impracticable for heavy vehicles because such vehicles are larger and more prone to rollover than light vehicles.
For the above reasons, the split mu and surface transition tests might be appropriate additions to the braking-in-a-curve
test for light vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency anticipates that each of these tests would be conducted at 30 mph using a full pedal application (200 pounds
pedal force applied within 0.2 seconds) and that the vehicle would be required to stay within a 12-foot lane. There
would be no stopping distance requirement as part of these tests. (The issue of separate tests for stopping distance
is discussed below in connection with question 13.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. As mentioned above, NHTSA is considering whether to propose a ``braking-in-a-curve test'' in which a light vehicle's
braking would be evaluated at a relatively slow speed on a slippery surface. This test is designed to evaluate the capability
of a vehicle to be controlled while braking in a curve. The test could be conducted on a 500-foot radius curve on a surface
with a peak friction coefficient (PFC) of 0.5 or less. What benefits would be obtained from such a braking-in-a-curve
test? What problems, if any, would be associated with this maneuver? Would this testing approach be a sufficient indicator
of the lateral control and stability expected from an ABS equipped light vehicle? How would rear-wheel-only antilock
systems perform under this test procedure? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. NHTSA is considering whether to propose another type of test, possibly as an alternative to the braking-in-a-curve
test. This test is known as a ``split coefficient of friction test'' (or split mu test) and is designed to evaluate a
vehicle's ability to be controlled when one side of a road is slick and the other side is much stickier. If NHTSA were
to propose such a test, it probably would be conducted on a straight lane surface with the high mu part of the surface
having a PFC equal to or greater than 0.5 and the low mu part of the surface having a PFC of less than or equal to one-half
the PFC of the high mu surface. An alternative way to describe the test surface would be to specify the PFCs for both parts
of the surface (e.g., the high mu part would be 0.9 or greater and the low mu part would be 0.45 or less). The test lane would
be split down the centerline along its length, so that the wheels on one side of the vehicle are on the high friction surface
and the wheels on the other side of the vehicle are on the slick surface. What benefits would be obtained from testing
on such a split mu surface? What problems, if any, would result from such a surface? Would this test be a sufficient indicator
of the lateral stability and control expected from an ABS-equipped vehicle? How would rear-wheel-only antilock
systems perform under this test procedure? What is the best way to specify the test surface? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. NHTSA is also considering whether to propose a ``low to high mu surface transition test.'' This test is designed
to evaluate the capability of an antilock system to modulate brake pressure to achieve a high level of deceleration
after the vehicle makes a transition to the high mu surface. NHTSA anticipates that if it proposes such a test, the high
mu surface would have a PFC equal to or greater than 0.5, and the low mu surface would have a PFC of less than or equal to
one half the PFC of the high mu surface. The agency is considering whether to propose requiring that the vehicle achieve
at least 95 percent of the deceleration of the uniform coefficient deceleration on the high mu surface within one second.
What benefits would be obtained from such a transition test? What problems, if any, would be associated with this test
maneuver? Would this test be a sufficient indicator of the modulation capability expected from an ABS-equipped light
vehicle? Would the suggested way of specifying test surfaces be appropriate? The agency requests comments about
whether to specify the time needed to achieve a specific deceleration and to specify a maximum lockup duration during
the transition. How would rear-wheel only antilock systems perform under this test procedure?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. NHTSA is considering whether to propose a ``high to low mu surface transaction test.'' This test is designed to
evaluate the response for the ABS when the vehicle begins braking on a high mu surface then experiences a change to a
low mu surface. This type of surface is discussed in the previous question. The agency is considering whether to require
that the vehicle's wheels not lock for more than 0.2 seconds, with wheel lock defined as 100 percent slip. What benefits
would be obtained from such a surface transition test? What problems, if any, would be associated with this test maneuver?
Would this test be a sufficient indicator of the modulation control and the response to impending wheel lock expected
from an ABS-equipped light vehicle? How would rear-wheel only antilock systems perform under this test procedure?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The efficiency of an ABS affects a vehicle's stopping distance performance with the ABS cycling. Consistent with
the agency's decision in the heavy vehicle ABS rulemaking not to propose stopping distance requirements with tests
involving low mu surfaces, NHTSA does not anticipate proposing, at this stage of this rulemaking, stopping distance
requirements with the curve, split mu, or transaction tests because of the variability of vehicle stopping distance
performance on low mu surfaces. Do commenters agree with the agency's tentative decision not to propose stopping
distance requirements with tests involving low mu surfaces? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding this tentative decision, NHTSA believes that a measurement of efficiency might provide consumers
with information to compare the relative overall performance of various ABSs. In its evaluations, the agency has
calculated ABS efficiency by dividing vehicle decelerations (g's) by the peak friction coefficient measured with
the vehicle's tire. The agency notes that an ABS efficiency value could provide consumers with a means of comparing
the ABS performance capability since no stopping distance requirements are being considered for the tests mentioned
in this notice to evaluate ABS performance. Each antilock system achieves a certain level of efficiency based on design
factors such as the wheel deceleration rate threshold at which ABS cycling begins, the control algorithm, and the
modulator valves. In general, the higher the ABS efficiency, the shorter the stopping distance should be with the
ABS operational. NHTSA's light vehicle ABS testing has shown that the improvements in braking performance provided
by an ABS varies, in some cases considerably, from system to system and from vehicle to vehicle. Hence, simply setting
a standard that requires all-wheel ABS would not necessarily mean that the performance of these systems would be similar.
The agency therefore request comments on what would be an appropriate method for measuring ABS efficiency, and whether
ABS efficiency would be a meaningful indicator of a system's overall performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The current requirements in Standard No. 105 for vehicles with failed antilock systems including stopping distance
requirements from 60 mph of 456 feet for passenger cars and 517 feet for other light vehicles with a GVWR of not more than
10,000 pounds. This test is designed to ensure that the vehicle has adequate braking if the ABS fails. These distances
may be overly generous for an ABS failure on some vehicles, given that the service brake system is generally still intact.
NHTSA anticipates proposing ABS failure requirements for Standard No. 105 similar to those proposed for Standard
No. 135. In that rulemaking, the agency proposed a stopping distance of 279 feet from a test speed of 62 mph on a surface
with a PFC of 0.9. What problems, if any, would be associated with such a requirement? Should the standard allow an ABS
that experiences a large degradation of stopping performance if the ABS fails? What is the best method for disabling
an ABS for a failed system test? Should performance requirements for integrated ABSs be any different from the requirements
for add-on ABSs, in the failed condition? If so, why? Should the failed ABS stopping distance be one absolute value
for all vehicles, or should it be based on the performance relative to the stopping distance performance when each
vehicle's ABS is in the ``on'' position?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
15. As explained in the previous section, NHTSA anticipates specifying the test surfaces used in the test procedures
in terms of peak friction coefficient. While the braking-in-a-curve test would have a PFC of 0.5, the split mu and transition
tests would have the surface specified based on the relative PFC of each of the two portions of the surface. The braking-in-a-curve
test surface represents a wet secondary road in poor condition, and the split mu and transition test surface represent
roads with different coefficients of friction such as those with ice patches. What practicability concerns, if any,
are raised by conducting tests on surfaces with both low and high coefficients of friction?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Two different methods of applying brakes can be used when testing ABSs (and braking systems in general). One method
is a ``full pedal'' application typical of how a driver might apply the brake pedal in reaction to a crash-threatening
situation. This type of brake application can precipitate wheel lock-up and loss-of-control if the vehicle is operating
on a slippery surface. A second method is a modulated ``driver-best-effort'' application in which the driver modulates
the brake in an attempt to maintain stability and lateral control. This method enables stops that are as quick and short
as possible while still maintaining stability and steering control. As with the heavy vehicle ABS rulemaking, the
agency anticipates proposing a full pedal application because it is more representative of a typical driver's response
to a real world crash-threatening situation. In addition, such an application is more objective and repeatable.
In specifying the amount of brake application force in this test procedure, the agency anticipates that a pedal force
of 200 pounds in 0.2 seconds would adequately represent a full pedal application for light vehicles. The agency requests
comments about the best way to specify the brake application provisions.

17. Agency testing indicates that all-wheel antilock systems provide full steering control and lateral stability
during braking. Real-wheel-only antilock systems do not ensure steering control during braking, but provide some
measure of vehicle stability during braking. Should the proposed requirements be drafted so that light vehicles
must be equipped with systems that provide ABS control on all wheels, or should the requirements be drafted to allow
rear-wheel-only systems as well? What are the differences in benefits between rear-wheel-only and all-wheel systems?

18. If NHTSA were to propose its braking standards to improve the lateral stability and control of light vehicles during
braking, all light vehicles would have to be equipped with lateral stability and control devices to achieve the new
performance requirements. As mentioned above, all-wheel ABSs were installed on 2,700,000 passenger cars and on
470,000 other light vehicles in 1992. While another 3.1 million light vehicles were equipped with rear-wheel-only
ABSs, vehicles are increasingly being equipped with all-wheel systems rather than rear-wheel-only systems. How
many vehicles would need to be equipped with ABSs to comply with the requirements discussed in this notice? Would it
be necessary to equip a vehicle with an all-wheel ABS to comply with the requirements discussed in this notice or would
rear-wheel-only systems be adequate?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. The ECE currently uses three categories to classify antilock systems by their performance capabilities. While
the ECE mandates the most sophisticated Category I systems for heavy vehicles, ABS installation remains voluntary
for light vehicles. Nevertheless, if a manufacturer decides to equip a light vehicle with ABS, then it must inform
the government approving body about the Category of ABS being installed on a given light vehicle. After being reviewed
by the government, the manufacturer may market its system to consumers as that category of ABS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is considering whether to propose a classification system like the ECE's in which there would be categories
of increasingly stringent performance criteria instead of a minimum requirement for all antilock systems. The performance
criteria, if proposed, might include the following factors:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency anticipates that most, but not all, of the all-wheel ABSs would satisfy the criteria for Category I systems
and that poorer performing all-wheel ABSs and rear-wheel only ABSs would satisfy the less stringent criteria of either
Category II and Category III.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifying categories would permit simpler antilock braking systems to comply with the standard, without lowering
the requirements for the higher capability systems. It would also serve to inform consumers that not all ABSs have
the same performance capabilities. However, the agency notes that there might be significant drawbacks to specifying
categories, since such an approach might result in unnecessary complexity and permit the manufacture and installation
of poorer performing systems that do not provide steering control and other significant safety benefits. The agency
invites comments about whether the standard should specify categories of ABSs.

G. Implementation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA's goal in initiating rulemaking to require light vehicles to be equipped with an ABS is to determine whether
significant improvements in braking performance can be achieved at a reasonable cost to manufacturers and consumers.
There are a number of different approaches that the agency could take in scheduling the implementation of the potential
proposals. One approach would be to apply the requirements to passenger cars first and then to all other light vehicles.
A second approach would be for the agency to apply the ABS standards to all light vehicles at the same time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
20. While the Authorization Act requires NHTSA to initiate rulemaking on brake performance for passenger cars, NHTSA
is contemplating using its general authority under the Vehicle Safety Act to broaden this mandate to include trucks,
vans, sport utility vehicles, and buses under 10,000 pounds GVWR. The agency is considering this approach because
it believes that ABS has more potential benefits for vehicles which have a greater disparity between their unloaded
and fully loaded weights. These latter type vehicles fall into this category. The agency notes that the market appears
to agree with this position as ABS is more prevalent in light trucks than passenger cars. NHTSA seeks comment on its
tentative decision to include these vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 21. At this stage in the rulemaking, NHTSA is inclined to propose an effective date of two years after the final rule,
for passenger cars, and three years after the final rule for light vehicles other than passenger cars (i.e., trucks).
The agency believes that this would give the industry sufficient leadtime to develop the production capacity needed
to supply the market with antilock systems. The agency expects that an increasing number of light trucks will be offered
with all-wheel antilock systems, particularly if the proposed requirements cannot be met with rear-wheel-only
systems. If this is the case, then manufacturers of light trucks with these systems might need more leadtime than manufacturers
of passenger cars to comply with the proposed requirements. Would this implementation schedule be appropriate?
Would it be reasonable to accelerate or delay any portion of it? Should the agency apply requirements for ABSs to some
light vehicles but not others?

22. NHTSA estimates that this rulemaking's potential cost would be approximately $1.04 billion per year. This cost
consists of ABS costs of $920 million, installation costs of about $80 million, and increased fuel costs of about $40
million due to a small increase in vehicle weight. The average retail price of an ABS system to the consumer would be
about $450. This price is based on a cost study of seven ABS systems entitled ``Evaluation of Costs of Antilock Brake
Systems'' and a markup factor of 1.51. The agency's cost estimate assumes that all-wheel ABS would be required on all
light vehicles. It projects that all-wheel ABS would be voluntarily installed as standard equipment in 85 percent
of model year 1999 passenger cars, the first model year that would be affected if a final rule were issued in 1996 and
a 2-year leadtime for compliance were provided. The remaining 15 percent or about 1.4 million vehicles would be equipped
only as a result of a requirement. The cost estimate also projects that all light trucks would be voluntarily equipped
with ABS by model year 1999/2000, 75 percent of them having all-wheel systems. Thus, 25 percent of new light trucks,
or about 1.5 million vehicles, would be involuntarily equipped with all-wheel ABS if the agency issued a final rule
requiring this. In this case, all-wheel ABS hardware and installation costs would be incrementally higher (about
$200 more), as compared to those for rear-wheel systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 How much would it cost per vehicle to equip all light vehicles with all-wheel ABSs? How much would it cost per vehicle
to equip these vehicles with rear-wheel-only ABSs? What would be the likely costs to a final purchaser for either of
the two types of antilock systems? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 23. Each light vehicle manufacturer is requested to provide, with respect to model year 1994, and for each of the following
types of vehicles, passenger cars, light trucks, and light MPVs: the total number of the vehicles it will produce;
the vehicles it will equip with rear-wheel-only ABSs; and the vehicles it will equip with all-wheel ABSs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 With respect to each of model years 1995&hyph;1999, and for each of the following types of vehicles, passenger cars,
light trucks, and light MPVs, what percentages of vehicles do you expect to voluntarily equip with a rear-wheel-only
ABS? With an all-wheel ABS? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Do you expect to install all-wheel ABSs on all of your passenger cars? If so, when? On all of your light trucks? On all
of your light MPVs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 24. NHTSA notes that some insurance companies currently offer discounts for antilock equipped passenger cars, light
trucks and light MPVs. Which insurers provide such a discount? How large is the discount offered by each of those insurers?
What is the basis for such discounts?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has considered the potential burdens and benefits associated with this advance notice. NHTSA has determined
that this advance notice is a significant rulemaking action under the Department of Transportation's Regulatory
Policies and Procedures and an economically significant notice under Executive Order 12866. The advance notice
would have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. It concerns a matter in which there is substantial
public interest. Further, there is a potential for significant safety benefits if effective requirements can be
developed to address braking stability and control of light vehicles. The preliminary Assessment of Economic Significance
for this advance notice addresses preliminary estimates of the costs and benefits of potential countermeasures
that the agency is considering in this action. Those estimates are summarized below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that ABS is effective in preventing, and reducing the severity of many inability-to-stop-in-time
and loss-of-control crashes. The previously mentioned 1975 Tri-Level study found ABS to be effective. Also, a preliminary
agency evaluation of more current data found rear-wheel ABS on light trucks to be effective in preventing certain
types of crashes. The agency is continuing to analyze the on-road experience of ABS-equipped vehicles as compared
to those with standard braking systems. At this time, the agency does not have sufficient data to estimate the safety
benefits of requiring mandatory installation of ABS on all light vehicles types. In this advance notice, the agency
is requesting information on ABS effectiveness and the safety benefits that could be expected from a requirement
for mandatory installation of the technology. In assessing the cost-effectiveness of any requirement for mandatory
installation of the technology, benefits accruing to vehicles on which ABS would not have been voluntarily installed
would be estimated and compared to the costs associated with equipping those vehicles with ABS. In the case of light
trucks, depending on the extent and type of ABS voluntarily installed and the type of ABS required, the benefits at
issue might be those that would be realized from all-wheel ABS as compared to rear-wheel systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA estimates that the annual consumer cost of requiring antilock brake systems on light vehicles to be $1,040 million:
$710 million for passenger cars and $330 million for light trucks. This assumes that all-wheel systems would be required.
Estimated ABS hardware cost would be $920 million, installation costs would be $80 million, and increased fuel costs
(due to a small increase in vehicle weight) about $40 million.

B. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has analyzed this action under the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612. The agency had determined
that this advance notice does not have sufficient Federalism implication to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. No State laws would be affected. The agency welcomes comment on this issue.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service proposed to determine the Alabama sturgeon, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Scaphirhynchus suttkusi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, to be an endangered species and to designate its critical habitat on June 15, 1993 (58 FR 33148). The Alabama sturgeon,
a small sturgeon with a maximum length of about 30 inches, is endemic to the Mobile River system, Alabama and Mississippi.
Its current range is restricted to the lower Alabama River and the Cahaba River in Alabama. Both of these areas and the
free flowing portion of the lower Tombigbee River are proposed as critical habitat. Factors in the sturgeon's decline
include dams, and possible adverse effects from altered water flows, channel maintenance and gravel dredging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A public hearing on the proposed rule was announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 13, 1993 (58 FR 47851) and was held on October 4, 1993 near Mobile, Alabama. The capacity of the facility
selected for the public hearing was not sufficient for all the individuals that wished to attend. A second hearing
was then announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 55036). The second public hearing was scheduled for November 15, 1993, in Montgomery, Alabama,
to allow additional oral statements to be presented and to receive comment on a scientific report prepared by experts
on the taxonomy and on the likelihood of existence of the Alabama sturgeon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The November 15 hearing was canceled in response to a preliminary injunction issued on November 9, 1993, that restrained
the Service and others from: (1) Disseminating the scientific report to the public; and, (2) utilizing or relying
upon the scientific report or any product of the experts' deliberations in connection with the decision-making process
on the proposal to list the Alabama sturgeon and to designate its critical habitat. Because the notice announcing
the November 15 hearing specifically addressed the availability of the scientific report and the Service's intent
to receive comments on it, the Service decided to postpone the hearing until a revised notice could be published to
announce the limitations imposed by, and to thereby avoid inadvertent violations of, the court order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 22, 1993, the court that issued the November 9 order issued another order providing, in most relevant part,
as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal defendants and defendant-intervenor, and those acting in active concert with them, are hereby permanently
enjoined from publishing, employing and relying upon the Advisory Committee report *&blank;*&blank;* for any purpose
whatsoever, directly or indirectly, in the process of determining whether to list the Alabama sturgeon as an endangered
species.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, a second public hearing has now been scheduled for January 13, 1994, and will allow additional oral statements
to be presented (of course, written comments will also be accepted and will be given equal consideration). The time
allocated for individual oral statements may be limited if the number of parties present at the hearing, or if the conduct
of the individual commenter, necessitate such a limitation. There is no limit, however, on the length or volume of
written comments or materials presented at the hearing or mailed to the Service office in the

, Civ. No. 93&hyph;AR&hyph;2322&hyph;S, the Service considers itself compelled to enforce the following constraints
on the submission of oral and written comments while the court restrictions remain in effect: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Individuals or organizations cannot refer to the scientific report, issued on November 5, 1993, or to any drafts
or other product derived from the preparation of that report, in presenting any oral statement or written comment;
and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Individuals or organizations cannot attempt to bolster their oral or written comments or opinions by reference
to the scientific report as authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Departmental hearing officer at the hearing on January 13, 1994, will be authorized to terminate the opportunity
to speak of any person making a statement if, in the judgment of the hearing officer, that person disregards the instructions
not to address the scientific report or its contents. Written comments or materials that contain information that
violates the above restrictions will be marked and thereafter excluded from the administrative record while the
court restrictions remain in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service intends that any final action resulting from the proposed rule will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Except for the court-imposed restrictions set out above, the Service encourages the submission of all individual
scientific opinions, biological data, and other relevant scientific data that will assist in arriving at the ``best
scientific and commercial data available,'' as mandated by Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend its regulations to establish Reference Daily Intakes
(RDI's) for vitamin K, selenium, chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum for use in declaring the
nutrient content of a food on its label or labeling; change the units of measure for biotin, folate, calcium, and phosphorus;
and make consideration of selenium, molybdenum, fluoride, and chromium optional when determining nutritional
inferiority. The agency is taking this action to assist consumers in understanding the nutritional significance
of the levels of these nutrients in the context of the total daily diet and in recognition of the fact that the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS) has established Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA's) or Estimated Safe and Adequate
Daily Dietary Intakes (ESADDI's) for these nutrients.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 19, 1990 (55 FR 29476), in a document entitled ``Food Labeling; Reference Daily Intakes and Daily Reference
Values'' (hereinafter referred to as the July 1990 proposal), FDA proposed to amend its food labeling regulations
by revising and expanding the list of label reference values for nutrients in foods that it had established. This list
was known as the ``U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances'' (U.S. RDA's) (&sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv) (21 CFR 101.9(c)(7)(iv)).
The agency proposed to replace the U.S. RDA's with RDI's for protein and 26 vitamins and minerals for which RDA's or
ESADDI's were provided in the 9th and 10th Editions of NAS' ``Recommended Dietary Allowances'' (proposed &sect;101.9(c)(11)(iv)
(56 FR 60366 at 60390)). FDA proposed to establish RDI's for vitamins and minerals for five groups: Adults and children
4 or more years of age, children less than 4 years of age, infants, pregnant women, and lactating women. It also proposed
to establish Daily Reference Values (DRV's) for eight nutrients and food components (i.e., total fat, saturated
fat, unsaturated fat, cholesterol, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sodium, and potassium) for adults and children
4 or more years of age.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the comment period on this proposal, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Nutrition Labeling
and Education Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535) (hereinafter known as ``the 1990 amendments''). In response to this
new law, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366, and corrected at 57 FR 8178, March 6, 1992), FDA issued a document entitled ``Food
Labeling: Reference Daily Intakes and Daily Reference Values; Mandatory Status of Nutrition Labeling and Nutrient
Content Revision'' (hereinafter referred to as ``the supplementary proposal''). In that document, FDA republished
and supplemented the July 1990 proposal and a proposal on nutrition labeling that FDA had also published in July of
1990 to make clear that in the agency's view, with some modifications, these proposals addressed the requirements
of the 1990 amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA received approximately 800 responses to the July 1990 proposal, and approximately 700 responses to that part
of the supplementary proposal that addressed the RDI's and DRV's, from trade and retail associations, government
organizations, retailers, consumer groups, State groups, private organizations, professional societies, and
universities. Each of the responses contained one or more comments. FDA summarized and reviewed these comments in
the final rule entitled ``Food Labeling; Reference Daily Intakes and Daily Reference Values'' that it published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2206, and corrected at 58 FR 17104, April 1, 1993) (hereinafter referred to as ``the RDI/DRV
final rule'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, on October 6, 1992, before FDA issued a final rule in response to the July 1990 and the supplemental proposals,
Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;571) (hereinafter referred to as the ``DS act'').
Section 202(a)(1) of the DS act established a moratorium on the implementation of the 1990 amendments with respect
to dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances (hereinafter referred
to as ``dietary supplements'') until December 15, 1993. Section 203 of the DS act prohibited FDA from promulgating
before November 8, 1993, regulations that require the use of, or that are based upon, recommended daily allowances
of vitamins or minerals, other than regulations establishing the United States recommended daily allowances specified
in &sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv) as in effect on October 6, 1992. The label values in &sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv) were based,
to a large extent, on the 1968 RDA's and thus were almost 25 years old. Nonetheless, with its discretion constrained
by section 203 of the DS act but faced with a need to establish a labeling scheme that manufacturers could implement
as quickly as possible, FDA simply adopted the values in &sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv) as in effect in 1992 in its new regulations
(see the RDI/DRV final rule).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, this solution created a new set of problems. Section 101.9(c)(7)(iv) as in effect in 1992, and the 1968 RDA's
that it was based on (Ref. 1), did not contain reference values for a number of nutrients that were included in the 1989
RDA's (Ref. 2). Thus, there is no provision in the RDI's for a number of nutrients whose importance for good nutrition
has been generally accepted. To remedy this situation, FDA is proposing to establish RDI's for these nutrients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is not proposing to change the RDI levels for those nutrients for which it has already established RDI's. FDA recognizes
that there is active debate within the scientific community as to the basis on which such levels should be established,
and therefore, the agency considers it premature to modify its current levels. However, FDA believes that at least
the list of nutrients for which it has RDI's, if not the RDI levels themselves, should reflect scientific consensus.
Therefore, FDA is proposing to establish RDI's for seven additional nutrients.

II. Authority for Additional Label Reference Values
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section (2)(b)(1)(A) of the 1990 amendments states that nutrition label information shall be conveyed in a manner
that, among other things, enables the public to understand its relative significance in the context of a total daily
diet. In the legislative history of this provision, Congress stated that this provision requires the Secretary to
specify requirements that would permit the consumer to understand the nutrition information pertaining to a particular
food in relation to recommended dietary information (H. Rept. 101&hyph;538, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 18 (1990)). Thus,
FDA has required that a presentation of the percent of the daily value of the nutrients listed in the nutrition label
be a fundamental part of the nutrition label format (see 58 FR 2079 at 2123 through 2135). Given the approach that FDA
has taken, it is clear that the more nutrients for which RDI's or DRV's are clearly established, the easier it will be
for consumers to understand information about that nutrient in the context of the total daily diet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the RDI/DRV final rule, FDA stated that over the last 20 years, there have been significant advances in scientific
knowledge with respect to essential nutrient requirements (58 FR 2206). In 1980, NAS established ESADDI values for
vitamin K, biotin, pantothenic acid, copper, manganese, fluoride, chromium, selenium, molybdenum, sodium, potassium,
and chloride for the first time (Ref. 3). These suggested intake values were based on less complete scientific data
than the RDA values and were regarded as more tentative and evolutionary (Ref. 3). In 1989, NAS updated the values for
vitamin K and selenium, making them RDA's rather than EASDDI's (Ref. 2). At that time, NAS continued to provide ESADDI
values for manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum but dropped the suggested values for sodium, potassium,
and chloride, giving instead estimated minimum requirements for healthy persons at various ages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Thus, given the usefulness of RDI values in conveying the information that Congress has said should be conveyed by
nutrition labeling, and given the fact that NAS has developed the basis for RDI's that are not included on the current
list, FDA tentatively concludes that it is appropriate to establish reference values for these seven nutrients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. The Need for Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;101.9(c)(8) that becomes effective May 8, 1994, only those vitamins and minerals for which FDA has established
label reference values may be listed in the nutrition labels of food in conventional food form. FDA proposed to take
a similar position with respect to nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals (58 FR 33715,
June 18, 1993). Several comments on the dietary supplement proposal argued, however, that because RDA's or ESADDI's
have been established by NAS for vitamin K, selenium, manganese, fluoride, chromium, molybdenum, and chloride,
manufacturers of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals should be allowed to declare these nutrients in products'
nutrition labels with an asterisk in the ``Percent Daily Value'' column. The comments suggested that the asterisk
refer to a footnote stating ``No Daily Value has been established.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its consideration of these comments and because the format that FDA proposed for dietary supplements of vitamins
and minerals provides for the listing of quantitative amounts for vitamins and minerals (in contrast to the format
for the nutrition labeling of foods in conventional food form, which provides for only a listing of the percent of the
daily value for each vitamin and mineral provided by the food), FDA provided for the listing of these nutrients in the
manner that was suggested by these comments in the final rule entitled ``Food Labeling; Requirement for Nutrient
Content Claims for Dietary Supplements of Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs, and Other Similar Nutritional Substances,''
published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, as an ultimate matter, FDA considers this solution to be deficient in two respects. First, even on dietary
supplements of vitamins and minerals, this solution provides no basis for a declaration of the percent of the daily
value for these nutrients, information that is, as stated above, important for consumers in putting the information
presented in the nutrition label in the context of the total daily diet. Second, the agency's action with respect to
dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals does nothing to provide information on the levels of these nutrients
in foods whose labeling is subject to &sect;101.9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the comments on the proposed rule on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33731)
pointed to a third type of problem created by the lack of reference values for the nutrients in question. Several of
those comments requested that nutrient content claims be allowed for all vitamins or minerals for which NAS has established
RDA's or ESADDI's. These comments could not be readily accommodated, however, because, as explained in the final
rule on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, FDA's regulations define terms such as ``high'' and ``good source'' based on the RDI or DRV for the nutrient that is
the subject of the claim. This approach has the advantage of linking nutrient content claims to established reference
values that provide a consistent, quantitative basis for the claims. However, because the agency's current list
of RDI's and DRV's does not reflect the entire list of nutrients for which dietary recommendations have been established,
no claims can be made about nutrients whose essentiality is generally recognized unless the list of nutrients with
RDI's is updated as quickly as possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, FDA is proposing to establish RDI's for vitamin K, selenium, chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium, and
molybdenum for three reasons. First, it will permit the declaration of these nutrients in the nutrition labeling
of all foods. Second, it will permit consumers of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals, as well as other foods
that contain these nutrients in significant amounts, to understand the amount of these nutrients present in these
products in the context of the total daily diet. Third, it will permit nutrient content claims to be made for these nutrients
on all foods.

IV. The Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Basis for RDI's for Vitamin K, Selenium, Chloride, Manganese, Fluoride, Chromium, and Molybdenum
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has determined that NAS RDA's are an appropriate basis for label reference values. Strong and uniform support
was provided for the use of NAS RDA's during the initial development of label reference values in 1972 as well as in response
to the July 1990 proposal and the supplementary proposal. The agency continues to believe that these established
nutrient allowances are the most widely accepted and respected source of information on human nutrient requirements
and recommended intakes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposing RDI's for these seven nutrients, the agency recognizes that if it adopts this proposal, some label reference
values will be based on the 1968 NAS RDA's, while others will be based on the 1980 and 1989 NAS RDA's. The agency believes,
however, that providing label information regarding the seven additional nutrients covered by the proposal would
be useful to consumers in making healthy dietary choices. As discussed in the previous section, without RDI's, there
can be no percent Daily Values expressed for these nutrients on the nutrition label, and nutrient content claims cannot
be made for them. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that the advantages of having a reference value for all nutrients
that NAS has found to be essential outweighs any disadvantages that derive from the fact that some of these values are
more reflective of current scientific thinking than others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, NAS is in the process of reevaluating the basis on which RDA's are determined. NAS is considering whether
values should be selected to prevent deficiencies or to promote optimal wellness. The agency believes that any action
to establish a set of RDI's with consistent derivation should await completion of the NAS process. FDA is committed
to working with NAS to help resolve this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Determination of Reference Amounts for Vitamin K, Selenium, Chloride, Manganese, Fluoride, Chromium, and Molybdenum
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on its consideration of comments on the 1990 proposal and on the supplementary proposal, FDA determined in the
RDI/DRV final rule that there is considerable support for the general approach of establishing label reference values
for vitamins and minerals by selecting the highest NAS RDA value from among those for persons 4 or more years of age (excluding
pregnant and lactating females) (58 FR 2206 at 2211). The comments stated that vulnerable or at-risk groups would
be sufficiently covered by selecting the highest value. Therefore, in the RDI/DRV final rule, FDA tentatively determined
that in establishing label reference values from NAS' RDA values, it would be appropriate to select the highest value
from among those for adults and children 4 or more years of age, excluding values for pregnant females and lactating
females (58 FR 2206 at 2211). FDA referred to this approach as the ``population coverage approach.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to use this approach in adopting RDI's for vitamin K, selenium, chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium,
and molybdenum. In doing so, the agency is setting forth a quantitative amount as well as a unit of measure for each nutrient.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to vitamin K, a review of the 1989 RDA values shows a range of recommended levels from 20 micrograms (&mu;g)
for children 4 to 6 years of age to 80 &mu;g for adult males from 25 to 51+ years of age (Ref. 2). Accordingly, using the
population coverage approach, FDA is proposing to adopt 80 &mu;g as the RDI for vitamin K.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the 1989 RDA values for selenium shows a range of recommended levels from 20 &mu;g for children 4 to 6 years
of age to 70 &mu;g for adult males from 19 to 51+ years of age (Ref. 2). Using the population coverage approach, FDA is
proposing to adopt 70 &mu;g as the RDI for selenium.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the 1980 ESADDI values for chloride shows a range from 700 to 2,100 milligrams (mg) for children 4 to 6 years
of age to 1,700 to 5,100 mg for adults (Ref. 3). To be consistent with the population coverage approach being used for
vitamins and minerals with RDA's, FDA said in the RDI/DRV final rule that when nutrients had ESADDI values, it would
select the highest ESADDI within the specified age groups to serve as the label reference value. When the ESADDI value
is presented as a range, FDA said it would use the midpoint of that range as the RDI. No comments were received that objected
to this approach (58 FR 2206 at 2212). Therefore, in accordance with this procedure, FDA is proposing to adopt 3,400
mg (the midpoint between 1,700 to 5,100 mg) as the RDI for chloride.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the 1989 ESADDI values for manganese shows a range from 1.5 to 2.0 mg for children 4 to 6 years of age to 2.0 to
5.0 mg for adults (Ref. 2). Consistent with the procedure discussed above, FDA is proposing to adopt 3.5 mg (the midpoint
between 2.0 to 5.0 mg) as the RDI for manganese.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For fluoride, a review of the 1989 ESADDI values shows a range from 1.0 to 2.5 mg for children 4 to 6 years of age to 1.5 to
4.0 mg for adults. Consistent with the procedure discussed above, FDA is proposing to adopt 3.0 mg (rounding the midpoint
between 1.5 to 4.0 mg, 2.75 mg, to 3.0 mg) as the RDI for fluoride.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For chromium, a review of the 1989 ESADDI values shows a range from 30 to 120 &mu;g for children 4 to 6 years of age to 50
to 200 &mu;g for adults and children 7 or more years of age. In accordance with the population coverage approach, FDA
is proposing to adopt 130 &mu;g (rounding the midpoint between 50 to 200 &mu;g, 125 &mu;g, to 130 &mu;g) as the RDI for
chromium.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, a review of the 1989 ESADDI values for molybdenum shows a range from 30 to 75 &mu;g for children 4 to 6 years of
age to 75 to 250 &mu;g for adults and children 11 or more years of age. In accordance with the population coverage approach,
FDA is proposing to adopt 160 &mu;g (rounding the midpoint between 75 to 250 &mu;g, 162.5 &mu;g, to 160 &mu;g) as the
RDI for molybdenum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv) to include the following values:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Vitamin K, 80 micrograms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selenium, 70 micrograms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chloride, 3,400 milligrams
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manganese, 3.5 milligrams
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fluoride, 3.0 milligrams
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chromium, 130 micrograms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Molybdenum, 160 micrograms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment to the proposal on nutrition labeling for dietary supplements recommended that biotin and folate be declared
in terms of micrograms, not milligrams, and that calcium and phosphorus be declared in terms of milligrams instead
of grams. The comment stated that consumers are more familiar with these nutrients being expressed in this manner.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA proposed in 1990 (56 FR 29476) to use the units suggested by this comment. However, section 203 of the DS act limited
the values that FDA could use in establishing RDI's to those contained in &sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv) until after November
8, 1993. Accordingly, as stated above, FDA adopted the current U.S. RDA values as the RDI's, with biotin and folate
expressed in terms of milligrams, and calcium and phosphorus expressed in terms of grams. Public health guidelines
and nutrition education efforts typically use the same units of measure as those found in the 10th Edition of NAS' RDA
and repeated in the 1990 proposal. Therefore, the agency agrees with the comment that changing the current units of
measure of biotin, folate, calcium, and phosphorus to those units specified in the 1990 proposal will facilitate
consumer comprehension of quantitative nutrient information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv) by changing the units of measure for biotin, folate,
calcium, and phosphorus to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
biotin-micrograms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
folate-micrograms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calcium-milligrams
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phosphorus-milligrams
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA points out that in following the provisions of the DS act and retaining the label reference values in current &sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv),
it did not adopt label reference values in the RDI/DRV final rule for use on foods purported to be or represented for
use by infants, children under 4 years of age, or pregnant or lactating women. Given the continuing questions about
how to arrive at such values, FDA is deferring action on this issue with respect to the issue of updating the RDI's. FDA
intends to propose RDI's for all nutrients, including vitamin K, selenium, chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium,
and molybdenum, for infants, children under 4 years of age, and pregnant and lactating women in a future rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the lack of reference values for infants, children under 4 years of age, and pregnant and lactating women,
labels of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals that are intended for these specific groups and that are regulated
under &sect;101.36 (21 CFR 101.36) may continue to specify the milligram or microgram amounts of these nutrients
with an asterisk in the percent Daily Value column. The asterisk would refer to a footnote stating ``Daily Value not
established.'' However, since milligram and microgram amounts are not listed for vitamins and minerals on labels
of foods in conventional food form, until such time as RDA's are established for infants, children less than 4 years
of age, and pregnant and lactating women, and barring a significant change in agency position in the final rule in this
proceeding, the seven subject nutrients may not be declared on labels of foods in conventional food form that are represented
or purported to be for use by these groups. FDA requests comment on whether or not this position is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One possible alternative would be to allow foods in conventional food form that are represented or purported to be
for use by infants, children less than 4 years of age, or pregnant and lactating women to list vitamin K, selenium, chloride,
manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum when they are present in the food in more than insignificant amounts
but without milligram or microgram amounts, only an asterisk that refers to a footnote stating that a Daily Value has
not been established. This alternative would alert consumers to the presence of these nutrients in the food, although
it would not give any indication of the amount present. FDA solicits comment on this and other alternative approaches.

C. Issues Concerning Specific Nutrients

1. GRAS Status of Selenium, Fluoride, and Chromium
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the RDI/DRV final rule, FDA reviewed several comments expressing concern about the GRAS status of selenium, fluoride,
and chromium (58 FR 2206 at 2215). These comments centered primarily around issues of their use in supplements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the agency stated in the final rule on mandatory nutrition labeling (58 FR 2079 at 2170), decisions with regard to
whether the use of sources of these nutrients is GRAS are outside the scope of this rulemaking. Any direct addition
of these trace minerals to a food is based on the manufacturer's judgment that use of the nutrient sources is GRAS.

The RDI/DRV final rule also addressed the effect of the label reference values on alternative products (e.g., reduced
fat foods). One comment suggested that with a larger number of vitamins and minerals listed in &sect;101.9(c)(8),
selected vitamins and minerals should be removed from the list of nutrients that, under &sect;101.3(e)(4)(ii) (21
CFR 101.3(e)(4)(ii)), must be present at the same level in a substitute food if that food is to be considered not nutritionally
inferior to the food for which it substitutes and resembles (58 FR 2206 at 2225). The agency acknowledged that an increase
in the number of nutrients for which label reference values (RDI's) are established would mean that efforts to obtain
nutritional equivalency may require the addition of nutrients to substitute foods (58 FR 2206 at 2225).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering this comment, FDA acknowledged that there were no FDA-approved sources of selenium, fluoride, chromium
or molybdenum for direct addition to foods (58 FR 2206 at 2225). Since there are no listed sources for these four nutrients,
the agency stated in the RDI/DRV final rule that if RDI's had been established for these nutrients, FDA would have amended
&sect;101.3(e)(4)(ii) to state that these nutrients are not required for nutritional equivalency (58 FR 2206 at
2225).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having received no objections to this statement, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;101.3(e)(4)(ii) to state that selenium,
molybdenum, fluoride, and chromium need not be considered in determining nutritional inferiority. If adopted,
this amendment will mean that a product that substitutes for another food that contains at least 2 percent more of the
RDI for selenium, molybdenum, fluoride, or chromium will not have to be fortified with these nutrients to avoid being
an ``imitation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency feels compelled, however, to point out that there are circumstances in which adequate amounts of selenium,
chromium, and molybdenum need to be supplied by particular foods because those foods may well be the sole item of the
diet. These foods include infant formulas, medical foods, or total diet replacement formulas. The agency notes that
selenium, molybdenum, and chromium have been used for several years in some infant formulas, medical foods, and total
diet replacement product without apparent problems. Although the agency has not determined whether the use of certain
compounds used by manufacturers of such products as sources of these nutrients is GRAS, FDA has not objected to these
additions at levels that result in daily intakes that do not exceed the upper limits of the NAS' ESADDI's.

V. Conforming Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revision of the nutrition labeling regulations in &sect;101.9 to provide RDI's for vitamin K, selenium,
chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum necessitates that FDA revise &sect;101.36(b)(3), (b)(4),
and (b)(4)(vi) as finalized in the document entitled ``Food Labeling; General Requirements for Nutrition Labeling
for Dietary Supplements of Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs, or Other Similar Nutritional Substances'' published elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 101.36(b)(3) specifically provides for vitamin K, chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum,
and selenium to be listed in the nutrition label of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals when present and for
quantitative amounts of the nutrients to be declared. Section 101.36(b)(4) states that no percent of Daily Value
shall be given for these seven nutrients in the nutrition label, and &sect;101.36(b)(4)(vi) states that when no percent
is given, an asterisk shall be placed in the ``Percent Daily Value'' column in the nutrition label that refers to another
asterisk that is placed at the bottom of the nutrition label that is followed by the statement ``Daily Value not established.''
FDA is proposing to amend &sect;101.36(b)(3) to remove all references to vitamin K, chloride, chromium, fluoride,
manganese, molybdenum, and selenium. Because these nutrients are proposed to be included in &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv),
they will be permitted to be listed in nutrition labeling without specific provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to &sect;101.36(b)(4) and (b)(4)(vi), once RDI's are established for vitamin K, chloride, chromium,
fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, and selenium for adults and children 4 or more years of age, the percent Daily Value
of these nutrients will be able to be calculated for this group. However, because RDI's are not being proposed for infants,
children less than 4 years of age, and for pregnant or lactating women (as discussed in section IV.C.1. of this document),
labels of products represented or purported to be for use by those groups will not be able to declare the percent Daily
Value for these nutrients. Therefore, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;101.36(b)(4) and (b)(4)(vi) to provide for
the use of an asterisk that will refer to the statement ``Daily Value not established'' for the seven subject nutrients
on products represented or purported to be for use by infants, children less than 4 years of age, and pregnant or lactating
women.

VII. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(11) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

VIII. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the economic implications of the proposed rule amending 21 CFR as required by Executive Order 12866
and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs
and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches
which maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects; distributive
impacts; and equity). The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that agencies analyze options for regulatory relief
for small businesses. FDA finds that this proposed rule is not a significant rule as defined by Executive Order 12866.
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed regulation allows manufacturers of foods in conventional food form and dietary supplements to declare
certain nutrients within the nutrition panel and to make content claims about those nutrients. The proposal provides
flexibility for those manufacturers who wish to disclose information about these seven nutrients without imposing
requirements on those firms producing products without these nutrients. Manufacturers of food in conventional
food form must change food labels if any of the nutrients are added to the product or if any claims are made. FDA is unsure
of the extent to which this will occur. FDA believes that the costs of this regulation are minimal. This regulation
will create benefits to the extent that the additional information allowed in nutrition labeling will help consumers
make healthy dietary choices.

present, or that are present in amounts that would be declared as zero, shall not be declared. In addition, potassium
shall be declared except when present in quantitative amounts by weight that allow a declaration of zero. The name
of each nutrient listed shall be immediately followed by the quantitative amount by weight of the nutrient. Nutrient
names and quantitative amounts shall be presented in a column under the heading ``Amount Per Serving'' and aligned
on the left side of the nutrition label. The heading ``Amount Per Serving'' shall be separated from other information
on the label by a bar above and beneath it, except that when calories are listed, the bar shall be placed beneath the calorie
declaration. When the serving size of the product is one unit (e.g., 1 tablet), a heading consistent with the declaration
of serving size, such as ``Amount per Tablet'' or ``Each Tablet Contains,'' may be used in place of the heading ``Amount

except that the percent for protein may be omitted as provided in &sect;101.9(c)(7), no percent shall be given for
sugars, and, for labels of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals that are represented or purported to be for
use by infants, children less than 4 years of age, or pregnant or lactating women, no percent shall be given for vitamin
K, chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, or selenium. This information shall be presented in one
column aligned under the heading of ``% Daily Value'' and to the right of the column of nutrient names and amounts. The
headings ``% Daily Value (DV),'' ``% DV,'' ``Percent Daily Value,'' or ``Percent DV'' may be substituted for ``% Daily
Value.'' The heading ``% Daily Value'' shall be placed on the same line as the heading ``Amount Per Serving'' or placed
beneath this heading and the bar underneath it, except that ``% Daily Value'' shall be placed beneath this bar when
calorie information is required to be declared. Calorie information shall be placed beneath ``Amount Per Serving''
and above the bar.
