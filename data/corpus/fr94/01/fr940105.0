SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule amends the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) regulations by providing that an
application for labor certification filed with a state employment office before October 1, 1991, must be filed with
the Service in connection with a petition filed under section 203(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act)
before October 1, 1993, in order to maintain a pre-October 1, 1991 priority date. This rule implements section 302(e)(2)
of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA), which amended section
161(c)(1) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT). This rule is necessary to ensure full public awareness of the October
1, 1993 deadline.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 29, 1991, the Service published a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 56 FR 60897&hyph;60913, revising 8 CFR 204.5(d), which provides that the priority date for an employment-based
petition that is accompanied by a labor certification shall be the date the request for labor certification was accepted
for processing by any office within the employment service system of the Department of Labor. A priority date cannot
be established unless the Service approves a petition under section 203(b) of the Act based on a labor certification
approved by the Department of Labor. Subsequent to the promulgation of this regulation, the President signed into
law the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991, (MTINA) Public Law 102&hyph;232,
dated December 12, 1991. Section 302(e)(2) of the MTINA, which amended section 161(c)(1) of the Immigration Act of
1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 102&hyph;649, dated November 29, 1990, was enacted in order to address the transition of
labor certifications filed before October 1, 1991 into the new employment-based immigrant visa categories created
by IMMACT. Section 302(e)(2) of MTINA provides that, in order to maintain the priority date of a labor certification
filed in connection with an employment-based petition which was submitted to a state employment office before October
1, 1991, the employer must file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act before October 1, 1993. Section 302(e)(2)
of MTINA further provides that if the Department of Labor approves a pre-October 1, 1991 labor certification application
subsequent to October 1, 1993, the employer must file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act within 60 days of the
date of certification. Although not specifically provided for in section 302(e)(2) of MTINA, the Service has interpreted
that section to require that, in the case of labor certifications which have been certified by the Department of Labor
between August 2, 1993 and October 1, 1993, a petition under section 203(b) must be filed within 60 days after the date
of certification to preserve the earlier priority date. This reading of section 302(e)(2) of MTINA furthers congressional
intent by allowing at least 60 days from the date of certification to file the petition under section 203(b) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of the above, 8 CFR 204.5(d) will be amended to reflect these MTINA amendments. The regulation will be further
amended to provide that if the petitioner fails to maintain the priority date by filing a timely petition, the new priority
date shall be the date a new petition is properly filed with the Service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service's implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provision for post-promulgation public comment,
is based on the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3). The reasons and necessity for immediate
implementation of this interim rule are as follows: Immediate promulgation of this interim rule is necessary to insure
full public awareness of the October 1, 1993 deadline mandated by MTINA. Specifically, petitioning employers who
submitted labor certification applications with a state employment office before October 1, 1991 and who have not
submitted a petition with the Service under section 203(b) of the Act, must be made clearly aware that the provisions
of 8 CFR 204.5(d), regarding assignment of priority dates, have been superseded by the MTINA amendments. Moreover,
immediate promulgation of these regulations will inform the petitioning employer that, in cases where the request
for labor certification was filed with a state employment office before October 1, 1991, it should file a petition
under section 203(b) of the Act with the Service as soon as possible after the Department of Labor has issued the labor
certification in order to obtain an earlier priority date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is anticipated
that this rule affects only a very limited number of petitioners and aliens who filed requests for labor certifications
prior to October 1, 1991, but have not yet filed petitions under section 203(b) of the Act. This rule is not significant
within the meaning of section 3(f) of E.O. 12866, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations governing fitness-for-duty (FFD) programs
that are applicable to licensees who are authorized to construct or operate nuclear power reactors and to licensees
authorized to possess, use, or transport formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material (SSNM). The amendment
permits licensees to reduce the random testing rate for all persons covered by the fitness-for-duty regulations
to an annual rate equal to 50 percent.

The NRC has reviewed experiences gained since publication of the current FFD rule on June 7, 1989 (54 FR 24468), and
implementation by power reactor licensees on January 3, 1990, and determined that it may be appropriate to modify
the random testing rate. Accordingly, on March 24, 1993 (58 FR 15810), the Commission published a proposed modification
to the FFD rule that would permit a reduction in the random testing rate for licensee employees, but maintain the 100-percent
random testing rate for contractors and vendors.

Summary of Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment period expired on June 22, 1993. Forty comment letters were received. Twenty-eight were from power reactor
licensees, six from unions, one from an industry association, one from a vendor, three from licensed reactor operators,
and one from a private citizen. There was overwhelming support for the proposed reduction in the annual rate of random
testing for licensee employees. Most of the commenters believed that the reduced rate also should apply to contractors
and vendors, and several commenters proposed a flexible, performance-based rate. There was no support for excluding
from any reduction in the random testing rate certain positions critical to the safe operation of a nuclear power plant,
such as licensed reactor operators. A summary of the comments received and the NRC's responses are presented below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Comment. The random testing rate for licensee employees should be reduced to 50 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the 23 commenters submitting comments on the Commission's proposed reduction of the random testing rate to
50 percent for licensee employees supported the proposal. The reason most often expressed was the low rate of positive
random test results experienced by licensee employees, particularly in comparison with other industries having
significant safety concerns. These commenters believe that this low industry-wide positive rate justifies the
lowering of the random testing rate to 50 percent. Some commenters stated that a 50-percent rate for licensee employees
would make that rate consistent with the random testing rate currently required in the substance abuse programs mandated
for entities regulated by the agencies within the Department of Transportation (DOT), including the Federal Aviation
Administration and the Federal Highway Administration. They also noted that DOT is currently considering lowering
its proposed random testing rate below 50 percent even though Federal Highway Administration data, for example,
indicate a significantly higher positive rate than that experienced among NRC licensee employees. Another commenter
pointed out that the lowered random testing rate for licensee employees subject to the NRC's FFD rule also would be
consistent with the random rate applied in the Commission's own internal drug testing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters supported the reduction with the expectation of significant cost savings for licensees as a result
of only testing approximately one-half the number of employees now being tested. In this regard, the Nuclear Management
and Resources Council (NUMARC) made reference to the November 1992 GAO report, ``Employee Drug Testing: Opportunities
Exist To Lower Drug-Testing Program Costs'' (GAO/GGD&hyph;93&hyph;13), which suggests reduced random testing
rates as a means of producing cost efficiencies in Federally mandated drug testing programs without adversely affecting
program integrity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning the relative effectiveness of alternative random testing rates, some commenters believe that a 50-percent
random testing rate would produce satisfactory deterrence of drug and alcohol abuse. This is particularly true in
light of the fact that other FFD program elements, such as program awareness training and behavioral observation,
and the access authorization program will continue to inhibit such behavior. Two commenters also supported the proposed
change because it would lessen the disruption of workers lives and reduce the invasion of privacy that random drug
testing creates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
NRC Response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC concurs with those commenters who stated that a 50-percent random testing rate as applied to licensee employees
can be expected to provide sufficient deterrence to justify lowering the rate at this time. It also agrees with the
observation that the access authorization program and other FFD program elements, such as policy communications
and awareness training, behavioral observation, for-cause testing, employee assistance programs, and the imposition
of strict sanctions for violations of an FFD policy will continue to deter drug and alcohol abuse by most of the workforce.
As some commenters noted, requiring fewer tests of licensee employees should decrease the privacy invasion experienced
by some employees. It also should result in cost savings across the industry by reducing lost work hours and the number
of tests to be administered.

The Commission recognizes that positive results in the nuclear power industry's random testing are generally among
the lowest of any U.S. industry. Nonetheless, it realizes that there are many variables that can affect the rate of
positive testing results and that relatively low positive test results, by themselves, are not the only indicator
of the effectiveness of a testing program either on an industry-wide or a licensee program level. Some of the variables
that could affect the testing results are the propensity of the population being tested to use drugs and alcohol, the
effectiveness of other program elements, and the extent to which tested employees have been successful in subverting
the testing process and avoiding detection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC does not have sufficient information about these or other factors that may influence testing results to be
able to determine that the decreasing positive rates reported by licensees are an unqualified indication of FFD program
effectiveness. Nonetheless, the Commission is gratified to observe the decreasing positive rates in licensee employees'
random test results during the past three years. The recently published NUREG/CR&hyph;5758, Volume 3, ``Fitness
for Duty in the Nuclear Power Industry: Annual Summary of Program Performance Reports,'' indicates that licensee
employees' positive random testing rate in 1992 was 0.20 percent as compared to 0.28 percent in 1990 and 0.22 percent
in 1991. There also have been decreasing positive rates for random testing of contractor and vendor personnel, viz.,
0.56 percent in 1990, 0.55 percent in 1991, and 0.45 percent in 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making its decision, the Commission has considered these testing results along with the apparent continuing strength
of the other elements of most licensees' FFD programs, the reduced invasion of employees' privacy interests, and
the potential for cost savings. In light of this industry experience and of these beneficial effects, the Commission
has concluded that it is reasonable at this time to lower the random testing rate for licensee employees and contractor
and vendor personnel to 50 percent. The response to Comment 4 discusses the Commission's reasons for allowing reduction
in the random testing rate for contractor and vendor personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Comment. The random testing rate should be reduced to less than 50 percent.

Four commenters recommended that the random testing rate be reduced to less than 50 percent. The rates they recommended
varied from 5 percent to 25 percent. Their central argument was that the random testing rate can be lowered substantially
without threatening the effectiveness of the program. The very low rates of drug and alcohol positive tests that have
been recorded by the nuclear industry during the first two years of FFD program operations are the basis for their recommendation.
One licensee stated that most chronic drug users probably have been eliminated and currently there is not a serious
drug or alcohol abuse problem in the industry. This commenter and NUMARC also cited the GAO study that found that the
percentage of positives does not vary significantly among Federal agency drug testing programs, regardless of what
random rate is used. Another licensee emphasized that behavioral observation, not random testing, is the most potent
tool in detecting drug abuse. Another commenter recommended that the NRC consider further reductions because the
effectiveness of other program elements makes a random rate of even 50 percent unnecessarily high.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant cost savings was given as the most compelling reason to reduce the random rate below 50 percent. One licensee
estimated the industry would save up to $30 million annually without degradation of the overall program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the response to Comment 1 above, positive random testing results are not, by themselves, the only indicator
of the FFD program's effectiveness in detecting substance abuse. The NRC does not have sufficient information about
the many variables that could affect testing results to be able to determine that a lower random testing rate would
maintain an acceptable level of program effectiveness. Therefore, the Commission believes that the industry's
relatively low numbers of drug and alcohol positive random test results should not be used as the sole justification
for lowering the random testing rate below 50 percent. While behavorial observation and for-cause testing are valuable
program elements, there still must be a strong random testing program that provides an adequate level of detection
and deterrence. The Commission continues to believe that it must choose a conservative and prudent random testing
rate that maximizes both detection and deterrence of substance abuse while minimizing the monetary and social costs
of such testing. The Commission believes that a 50-percent random testing rate will strike the proper balance between
the dictates of public health and safety, the financial needs of licensees, and the privacy and other interests of
workers subject to the testing requirement. Given the substantial unknowns currently associated with the true detection
and deterrence effectiveness of alternative random testing rates as applied to the particular conditions of the
nuclear power industry workforce, the Commission believes that it cannot establish a random testing rate lower than
50 percent for any segment of the industry at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that relatively low positive test rates do not necessarily indicate that there is not a drug
and alcohol abuse problem, as some commenters asserted. First, some users have become adept at avoiding detection,
and the use of increasingly effective subversion techniques may be one reason why random testing results are decreasing.
Second, while it may be that most of the chronic drug users who were in the industry when the program started have been
detected or have left, there can be expected to be a continuing level of intermittent illegal drug use and alcohol abuse
among industry employees; such use is difficult to detect. The Commission concludes that the low positive random
test results do not indicate that there has ceased to be a drug and alcohol abuse problem and that further reduction
in the random testing rate would not be appropriate at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the commenters' reference to the GAO's observation that the percentage of positives does not vary significantly
among Federal agency drug testing programs, the NRC notes that the GAO's objective in that report was to identify potential
cost savings in Federal employee drug testing programs. Its objective did not include determination of the relative
deterrent values of alternative random testing rates. In accomplishing its objective, the GAO properly concentrated
on only the costs associated with Federal employee drug testing. It did not perform an indepth analysis of the several
variables that influence testing results nor of the very complex relationship between those variables and the deterrence
value of testing. Such variables would include the inclination for drug or alcohol abuse among the employees in the
various industries in which the Federal testing programs operate, the extent to which the strength and effectiveness
of other, non-testing program elements, such as drug awareness training, may affect testing results, and the relative
stringency of sanctions imposed by the various Federal agencies following positive test results. Because the GAO's
objective was to address the cost rather than the deterrence effectiveness of testing, the NRC does not consider the
commenter's reference to the GAO's observation to be a persuasive argument for reduced random testing rates.

The NRC will continue to monitor implementation of the rule and will modify the rule in response to industry experience,
advances in technology, or other considerations to ensure that the rule is achieving the general performance objectives
set forth in 10 CFR Part 26.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Comment. The random testing rate should be flexible and based on performance, such as the positive rate of random
testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twelve commenters recommended that the Commission allow some form of performance-based approach to determine the
random testing rate. Under such a system, the random testing rate would vary over time. This would depend on each licensee's
or, alternatively, the industry's positive random test results from a previous period. One licensee, for example,
suggested that each licensee's random testing rate should be based upon that particular licensee's previous 12-month
testing results. Under this approach, a licensee would be subject to a minimum 50-percent random testing rate if it
experienced a positive rate of greater than 0.50 percent during the previous 12 months. That licensee could reduce
its random rate to 25 percent if it subsequently had a 12-month positive rate between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent
or to as low as 10 percent if its positive rate for the previous year was less than 0.25 percent. Three other licensees
recommended similar schemes whereby a licensee's random rate would be determined by its own record of positive test
results. One of these recommendations based the rate on the results of the previous 2 years rather than those of the
previous 12 months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUMARC proposed that the industry-wide random testing rate be determined by the industry-wide random testing results
from the previous period. This recommendation was endorsed by five licensees. Under NUMARC's proposed approach,
the industry would be allowed by regulation to adjust its random testing rate based on testing results from the previous
reporting period. All licensees would be required to test at a 100-percent random rate if the industry-wide positive
rate were greater than 1.0 percent in the previous period, at a 50-percent random rate if the positive rate was between
0.50 percent and 1.0 percent, at a 25-percent random rate if the positive rate was between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent,
and at a 10-percent random rate if the positive rate was less than 0.25 percent. Two of the eleven licensees favoring
a performance-based testing system provided a general recommendation that did not specify whether the random testing
rate should be based on the positive testing results of each individual licensee, or on the results of the industry
as a whole.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters noted various potential advantages of adopting a performance-based approach to setting the random
testing rate. One stated that adopting such an approach would be consistent with the NRC's initiative to identify
performance-based programs that would be beneficial to the industry. Another listed cost savings, equity in that
each licensee's random rate would be commensurate with its program performance, and an incentive for licensees to
maximize program conformance with the FFD rule as advantages of such an approach.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During development of 10 CFR part 26 in 1989, the Commission considered a variation of the flexible, performance-based
random rate similar to the approaches recommended by these commenters. (See, for example, the NRC's response to Comment
7.4.2 in NUREG&hyph;1354, ``Fitness for Duty in the Nuclear Power Industry: Responses to Public Comments.'') At
that time, the Commission decided against adopting a performance-based rate for various reasons. As stated above,
positive random testing results are not the only indicator of detection and deterrence effectiveness or of overall
random testing program performance to allow the testing rate to vary with testing results. Adopting a performance-based
approach would tend to discourage the initiatives that the Commission is encouraging in 10 CFR 26.24(b) and in Section
2.1 of Appendix A to Part 26. In &sect;26.24(b), the NRC allows licensees to implement programs with more stringent
standards, for example, lower screening and confirmation cutoff levels and a broader panel of drugs than those specified
in the rule. In Section 2.1 of Appendix A, licensees are permitted to test for any illegal drugs during a for-cause test
or analysis of specimens suspected of being adulterated or diluted. Program performance data for the first three
years of FFD program implementation have shown that those licensees using screening cutoff levels for marijuana
that are lower than the maximum allowed 100 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) have had a higher percentage of confirmed
positive results than those screening at 100 ng/ml. (See NUREG/CR&hyph;5758, Vols. 1&hyph;3.) Licensees that employ
special measures to detect attempts to dilute specimens or flush metabolites from the body report that their positive
rate is about doubled. This result is similar to data presented to the Department of Health and Human Services' Drug
Testing Advisory Board on June 10, 1993, and reported in ``The National Report on Substance Abuse'' on June 18, 1993.
(The study is currently undergoing peer review before publication.) Adopting a performance-based approach that
allowed licensees to reduce their random testing rates as positive testing results declined would likely discourage
licensees from adopting lower screening cutoff levels and taking measures to detect attempts by users to avoid detection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, a performance-based approach would require the collection and analysis of performance data to provide the
bases for adjustments to the random testing rate. Such data is not currently collected by the licensees or the NRC.
Previous efforts known to the NRC staff to identify and analyze the many candidate performance indicators for measuring
the effectiveness of random testing have been inconclusive, primarily because of the numerous variables. Furthermore,
assuming that the proper performance indicators can be developed, it would appear that the collection and analysis
of data to support a performance-based approach would add a considerable administrative burden to both licensees
and the NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all these reasons and until further experience is gained that would support a performance-based approach, the
Commission declines to adopt such an approach to setting the random testing rate.

4. Comment. The reduction in the random testing rate should be applied to all workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four of the 30 commenters on this issue_three unions and one licensee_supported the Commission's proposal that licensees
maintain the 100-percent random testing rate for contractor and vendor employees. Their reasons included a concern
for lack of commitment by contractor employees to maintaining the industry's high drug-free standard and the need
for the higher testing rate to provide continued deterrence for contractor employees. One of the three unions recommended
that long-term contractors should have the same lower random testing rate as that of licensee employees because test
results of long-term contractors and licensee employees have been almost identical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were several issues consistently mentioned by those 26 commenters who opposed maintaining the 100-percent
random testing rate for contractor and vendor employees. There was a general concern for unnecessary inconsistencies
in random testing rates between Federal agencies. Commenters recommended that the NRC program be kept as consistent
as possible with programs in other Federally regulated safety-related industries. These include the DOT programs
that currently require contractors and vendors to be randomly tested at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50-percent rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various licensees cited the testing results from 1990 and 1991 which, in their opinion, create no statistically sound
rationale for testing contractor and vendor employees at a rate different from that of licensee employees. They argued
that, while the contractor/vendor positive testing rate has been twice that of licensee employees, it is still low
enough to make unnecessary the expenditure of the resources necessary to maintain two separate random testing pools.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various commenters noted that contractors and vendors are subject to the identical access authorization and other
FFD program requirements as are licensee employees, including behavioral observation. These stringent requirements,
in their view, obviate the need to keep the contractor/vendor random rate at 100 percent. Some also noted that the deterrent
value of random testing is in the act of testing itself and not in what many consider to be a high rate of testing. Some
commenters warned that keeping contractors and vendors at 100 percent could be construed as discriminatory against
those employees and may be perceived as punitive rather than as a corrective measure. Two licensees also cited a study
of the detection effectiveness of nine random testing rates published in NUREG/CR&hyph;5784, ``Fitness for Duty
in the Nuclear Power Industry: A Review of the First Year of Program Performance and an Update of the Technical Issues,''
which indicates that a 100-percent testing rate is only a little more effective than a 50-percent rate for detecting
occasional drug users.

Although there is a difference between the positive results of random testing of licensee employees and those of contractor
and vendor employees, the positive random testing rate of both groups has been less in each year since 1990, as stated
in the response to Comment 1 above. While the contractor/vendor random testing positive rates continue to be about
twice the rate for licensee employees and statistical analysis of the data shows that the difference in proportion
between the contractors' and licensees' employees is not explained within statistical fluctuations (therefore,
differences in the rates are statistically significant), the Commission agrees that the absolute numbers of positive
test results of all categories of nuclear power workers are low. Therefore, the Commission will permit its licensees
to lower the random testing rate to 50 percent for all persons covered by 10 CFR part 26. However, the Commission will
continue to monitor licensee program performance and effectiveness and will make program adjustments as necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the comments regarding the study of the detection effectiveness of nine random testing rates published
in NUREG/CR&hyph;5784, the Commission notes that the study explicitly dealt with only the hypothetical detection
effectiveness of those alternatives. It did not address their relative deterrence effectiveness. While it may be
that the effectiveness of a 100-percent random testing rate for deterring occasional drug users could be slightly
higher than that of a 50-percent rate, the Commission nonetheless believes that a 50-percent random testing rate
will provide sufficient deterrence to drug and alcohol abuse by contractor and vendor employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to commenters' concerns about unnecessary inconsistencies in random testing rates between Federal
agencies, the Commission continues to believe that the random test rate for employees in the nuclear power industry
need not be similar to the rates applied to employees in all, or even most, other Federal agencies or Federally mandated
programs. Not all Federal agencies have identical safety concerns or responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Comment. There should be no difference in the random testing rate for certain positions critical to the safe operation
of a nuclear power plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventeen commenters responded to the Commission's question as to whether certain positions critical to the safe
operation of a nuclear power plant, such as licensed reactor operators, should be excluded from any reduction of the
random testing rate. All these commenters recommended against such differentiation. Two licensees stated that
treating people in positions critical to safety differently from other employees could have a negative effect on
the morale, self-image, and motivation of this group of highly trained and dedicated specialists. Another stated
that all plant employees are critical to safe operation. Therefore, a reduction in the random testing rate should
apply to all employees. The potential for added record-keeping requirements creating unnecessary burdens for the
industry was another reason for not making this distinction. In the opinion of one commenter, the 1990&hyph;1992
industry-wide program performance data do not support testing people in positions critical to safety at a different
rate than that applied to other licensee employees. Finally, one licensee cited potential problems getting union
agreement to testing this classification of employees at a higher rate than other licensee personnel subject to the
FFD rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The essence and unanimity of these comments_that licensed operators and other employees in positions critical to
the safe operation of a nuclear power plant should not be excluded from a reduction of the random testing rate_is not
surprising. These particular members of the nuclear power industry's workforce have collectively demonstrated
their dedication to safe and efficient plant operations. As at least one commenter noted, the industry's program
performance data for the first three years of operation do not support differentiating between people in safety-critical
positions and other licensee employees insofar as the random testing rate is concerned. The 1992 program performance
data, for example, show that eighteen of the industry's approximately 5,000 licensed operators tested positive
for drugs or alcohol or otherwise violated the licensee's FFD policy; twelve of these were a result of random testing.
When comparing these results to the 461 positive results out of 156,730 random tests administered to the industry
workforce, the difference in proportion between the licensed operators and the industry workforce is within statistical
fluctuations and the difference in the positive rates is not statistically significant. While the NRC expects licensees
to continue to take action to drive this number of positives down even further, this record does not merit testing people
in these positions at a rate different from that applied to other licensee employees. The Commission, therefore,
concurs with the commenters' recommendation that certain positions critical to the safe operation of a nuclear power
plant, such as licensed reactor operators, should not be excluded from a reduction of the random testing rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Comment. Random testing is expensive and produces false positives. Furthermore, chronic users are able to avoid
detection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters, a power plant worker and a union, argued against the usefulness of continued random testing. One of
these commenters stated that random testing produces false positives. These cost the industry large amounts of money
in settlements and damage the public's perception of licensees' fairness. As additional support for this position,
this commenter warned that chronic drug abusers are particularly adept at escaping detection from random testing
by subverting the testing process. The other commenter recommended that random testing be eliminated because it
is not effective in identifying workers who are impaired at the time urine samples are collected. For-cause testing,
in this commenter's opinion, is more effective because it more accurately reflects a worker's present ability to
perform his/her job at the time he/she is tested. This commenter also stated that random testing appears to be a means
of having the NRC enforce the Controlled Substances Act which is not the NRC's responsibility.

The Commission has long been well aware of the types of FFD program-related concerns as addressed by these commenters.
During the promulgation of 10 CFR part 26 in 1989, the Commission fully addressed these and many other such concerns.
(See NUREG&hyph;1354, ``Fitness for Duty in the Nuclear Power Industry: Responses to Public Comments.'') At that
time the NRC concluded, for example, that licensee FFD programs should be concerned not only with impairment, but
also with worker reliability and trustworthiness. The NRC believes that any illegal drug use or alcohol abuse by a
worker reflects upon his or her trustworthiness and reliability. Likewise, random testing is not intended, nor has
it ever functioned, as a means to enforce the Controlled Substances Act. Section 26.29(b) provides that licensees,
contractors, and vendors shall not disclose test results to law enforcement officials unless those officials request
such information under court order. It also is noted that there is no requirement to routinely provide such officials
with testing results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is well aware that there is a potential for false positive results and, therefore, has required numerous
quality control measures and safeguards to prevent such occurrences. In Appendix D to NUREG/CR&hyph;5758, Volume
3, the testing process errors that were reported by licensees during the first three years under the FFD rule were analyzed.
Of over 800,000 specimens tested, there were two false positives of personnel specimens reported by the laboratories,
both due to administrative errors. In both cases, the quality assurance programs detected and corrected the problem.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the NRC's particular concern with the degree to which the testing process can be subverted, the Commission
staff has continued to track the ways in which workers have subverted testing processes in industries across the country.
These efforts have resulted in staff recommendations for amending 10 CFR part 26 to introduce various means for combatting
subversion. Lastly, the Commission believes that the added protection of public health and safety that the FFD program
provides is well worth the industry's costs of administering this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Comment. Maintaining two separate populations of workers for random testing is an unnecessary and expensive burden.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the commenters stated that requiring two random testing rates would force licensees to develop two separate
testing programs. The resulting additional administrative and financial burdens would cancel out any savings resulting
from reducing the licensee employee rate to 50 percent. NUMARC stated that the industry would save approximately
$4.1 million if the number of tests of contractor and vendor employees was cut in half.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some of the comments noted above asserted that separate random testing rates for licensee employees and contractors/vendors
would create additional administrative and financial burdens for licensees. Although this issue is somewhat moot
since the Commission will permit licensees to reduce the random testing rate to 50 percent per year for all persons
covered by Part 26, the Commission does not concur that conducting random testing using two random rates would have
caused appreciably higher administrative or operating costs. Presumably, most licensees' data bases already distinguish
between licensee employees and contractor/vendor employees subject to testing. Numerous commenters on the initial
rule in 1989 indicated that the workforce population should be separated so that permanent employees would not be
tested at a much higher rate to make up for contractors who might not be on site when selected for testing (see comment/response
7.4.3 of NUREG&hyph;1354). The NRC staff understands that several licensees have divided their testing population
as permitted by the rule. The number and identity of licensee employees in the testing pool remains rather constant
over time. The number and identity of contractor/vendor employees in the testing pool, on the other hand, varies quite
considerably over time depending on outages and other operational considerations. A licensee may choose to create
more than one test population so that it may test portions of its workforce at a greater rate or reduce the burden on its
employees from being tested at a higher rate to compensate for the testing of contractors and vendors not normally
on site.

In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule affects only the licensing
and operation of nuclear power plants and activities associated with the possession or transportation of Category
I material. The companies that own these plants do not fall within the scope of the definition of ``small entities''
set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act or the Small Business Size Standards issued by the Small Business Administration
in 13 CFR part 121.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule represents a relaxation from current part 26 requirements for drug testing since the rule permits (but does
not require) licensees to reduce the random testing rate for all persons covered by the rule. Accordingly, the rule
does not represent a backfit as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1), and a backfit analysis is not required for this rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 an amendment adopting Airworthiness Directive (AD) T93&hyph;24&hyph;51 that was sent previously to all known U.S.
owners and operators of all Airbus Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes by individual telegrams. This AD
requires repetitive operational tests of feel and limitation computers (FLC) 1 and 2. This amendment is prompted
by a report that the pitch control on a Model A300&hyph;600 series airplane operated with stiffness. The actions specified
by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD are intended to prevent stiff operation of the pitch control and undetected loss of rudder travel limitation function.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 1, 1993, the FAA issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
telegraphic airworthiness directive (AD) T93&hyph;24&hyph;51, which is applicable to all Airbus Model A310 and
A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. That action was prompted by a report from an operator that the pitch control on a Model
A300&hyph;600 series airplane operated with stiffness. Investigation into the cause of this stiffness revealed
that the feel and limitation computer (FLC) failed and caused stiff operation of the pitch control. This condition,
if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not corrected, could result in stiff operation of the pitch control and undetected loss of rudder travel limitation
function, which may adversely affect controllability of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Airbus Industrie has installed these computers on all Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. Each airplane
has two FLC's, designated FLC 1 and FLC 2. The FLC and the pitch feel fault lights are integral components of the pitch
feel system. (The pitch feel fault lights indicate a failure of the FLC.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, these airplanes are allowed to operate with one inoperative pitch feel system. If the airplane is operated
with one inoperative pitch feel system, failure of the other FLC could result in stiff operation of the pitch control
and undetected loss of rudder travel limitation function. This failure could also allow excessive elevator movement,
which could expose the airplane structure to excessive air loads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus Industrie has issued All Operator Telex (AOT) 27&hyph;14, dated November 2, 1993, applicable to all Airbus
Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes, that describes procedures for performing repetitive operational
tests to verify proper operation of FLC's 1 and 2. The Direction &Gacute;e&nacute;erale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC),
which is the airworthiness authority for France, classified this AOT as mandatory and issued French telegraphic
airworthiness directive 93&hyph;202&hyph;153(b), dated November 2, 1993, in order to assure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described
above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action
is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered
in the United States, the FAA issued Telegraphic AD T93&hyph;24&hyph;51 to require repetitive operational tests
to verify proper operation of FLC's 1 and 2. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the AOT previously
described. Any FLC that fails the operational test is required to be repaired or replaced in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with a method approved by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AD also prohibits operation of any airplane with an inoperative pitch feel system or inoperative pitch feel fault
lights.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, notice and opportunity for prior public comment
thereon were impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately
by individual telegrams issued on December 1, 1993, to all known U.S. owners and operators of all Airbus Model A310
and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. These conditions still exist, and the AD is hereby published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as an amendment to &sect;39.13 of part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to make it effective as to all persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer has advised that it currently is developing a modification
that will positively address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this modification is developed, approved,
and available, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
``ADDRESSES.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted
will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in
the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;NM&hyph;208&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the
Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to certain Allied Signal Aerospace Company,
Air Transport Avionics (Allied Signal) Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) II processors that are
installed on aircraft. This action requires replacing the existing TCAS II processor with a new processor that incorporates
updated computer logic. The development of candidate enhancements to TCAS II logic that improves its utility and
increases its overall operational acceptance prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by this AD are
intended to prevent collisions or near misses caused by incompatibility between the TCAS II processors and the current
air traffic control system.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that applies to certain Allied Signal
TCAS II processors that are installed on aircraft was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 9, 1993 (58 FR 47405). The action proposed to require (1) removing from service all processors that do
not have computer logic ``Change 6.04A'' incorporated; and (2) mandatory incorporation of ``Change 6.04A'' into
the TCAS II computer system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Interested persons have been afforded an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to participate in the making of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment. Due consideration has been given to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received from 33 different owners, operators, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, and organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All commenters express their concern of the FAA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance date of December 30, 1993, especially since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allied Signal's service bulletin will not be available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until early 1994. The following summarizes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance times that the commenters recommended: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;18 recommended one year or less; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;5 recommended longer than one year; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;10 recommended an extension without a proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Air Traffic Controllers Association and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Airline Pilots Association both recommend an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``aggressive implementation'' of ``Change 6.04A''. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has re-evaluated the December 30, 1993, compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time and has determined that the compliance time should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be changed to December 31, 1994. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Change 6.04A'' has been upgraded to ``Change 6.04A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced'', which eliminates unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-crossing resolution advisories (RA's) included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Change 6.04A''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allied Signal has assured the FAA that (1) the upgrade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ``Change 6.04A Enhanced'' is minor and will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated in the logic change for the TCAS II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor upgrades; and (2) this compliance time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correlates with their schedule for disseminating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service information and kits necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the incorporation of ``Change 6.04A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced''. The proposed AD has been changed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect the compliance time change and logic change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, Allied Signal states that ``Change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.04'', which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA-certified and is currently in service, accomplishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the major intent of ``Change 6.04A Enhanced'' and should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered as an acceptable interim version to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the eventual upgrade to ``Change 6.04A Enhanced''. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA recognizes that ``Change 6.04'' incorporates several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the features of ``Change 6.04A Enhanced''. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FAA has determined that (1) ``Change 6.04'' does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an equivalent level of safety to that of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Change 6.04A Enhanced''; and (2) ``Change 6.04A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced'' should be incorporated as a way to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collisions or near misses caused by incompatibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the TCAS II processors and the current air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traffic control system. Compliance time extension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration will be given on a case-by-case basis to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airlines or operators experiencing compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficulties that arise because of fleet size. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD remains unchanged as a result of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allied Signal also lists several additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aircraft that these TCAS II processor units are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified for installation. The FAA has incorporated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these into the proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, who supports the implementation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Change 6.04A Enhanced'', requests that the FAA issue a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propose installing this revised software by June 30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995. This commenter states that significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differences exist between ``Change 6.04A'' and ``Change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.04A Enhanced''. The FAA does not concur. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received in response to the proposed AD reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unanimous support for implementing ``Change 6.04A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced''. The FAA considers the logic change (which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduces non-crossing RA's) to be minor. The intent is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to correct the unsafe condition by installing modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCAS II computer units that incorporate updated logic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that the requirement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement Version 6.04A software, including the latest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhancement, will (1) correct the unsafe condition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) maintain the same intent originally proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without altering the substance of the proposed rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) impose no additional burden on the public than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was previously proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, issuing a supplemental NPRM would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessitate (under the provisions of the Administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comment period, considering any additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received, and eventually issuing a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The time required for these procedures could take as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long as four additional months. In light of this, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in consideration of the amount of time that has already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elapsed since issuance of the original NPRM, the FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concludes that soliciting further public comment is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary and that further delay of the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters request that the FAA revise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact specified in the proposed AD to reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs associated with the development, testing prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification, and certification of the modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor. These costs would be absorbed by suppliers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installers, and airline operators. The FAA does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concur that the economic impact statement include this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. The 1 workhour necessary to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed action was provided to the FAA by the TCAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II processor manufacturer based on the best data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to date. This number represents the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to install the revised software. The cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis in AD rulemaking actions typically does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include costs associated with development, testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to certification, and certification of a modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor. The proposed action remains unchanged as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of these comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of all available information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the comments noted above, the FAA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that air safety and the public interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change in compliance time, the logic reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change, the incorporation of known aircraft that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCAS II processor units are installed on, and minor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these changes and corrections will not change the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public than was already proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 3,000 TCAS II processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it will take approximately 1 workhour per processor to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the required action, and that the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these figures, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators is estimated to be $165,000. These figures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are based on the assumption that none of the operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the airplanes equipped with the affected TCAS II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors have accomplished the actions specified in

The regulations adopted herein will not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the national government and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, or on the distribution of power and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities among the various levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all Honeywell Traffic Alert and Collision
Avoidance System II (TCAS II) computer units installed on various transport category airplanes, that requires replacing
certain TCAS II computer units with new units that incorporate updated collision avoidance system (CAS) logic, and
modifying the computer surveillance logic. This amendment is prompted by the development of candidate enhancements
to TCAS II logic that will improve its utility and increase its overall operational acceptance. The actions specified
by this AD are intended to prevent collisions or near misses caused by incompatibility between the TCAS II processors
and the current air traffic control system.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to all Honeywell Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS II) computer units installed on
various transport category airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 9, 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(58 FR 47407). That action proposed to require replacing certain TCAS II computer units with new units that incorporate
updated collision avoidance system (CAS) logic, and modifying the computer surveillance logic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the issuance of the notice, an additional change to Version 6.04A collision avoidance system (CAS) logic was
recommended at a meeting held to discuss the progress made in implementing logic modification 6.04A. Meeting attendees
included representatives from the FAA and European civil aviation authorities, U.S. and European aviation industry,
and U.S. operators. The logic change that was recommended involves reducing unnecessary crossing resolution advisories
(RA). That change is included in a new enhanced software package (identified as Version 6.04A), specified in Mitre
letter F046&hyph;L&hyph;0069, dated September 21, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequently, Honeywell Inc. has issued Service Bulletin 4066010&hyph;34&hyph;SW16, dated December 20, 1993.
The service bulletin describes procedures for converting certain TCAS II computer units to new units (Version 6.04A).
The new units incorporate all of the logic changes specified in the preamble to the notice, including updating CAS
logic, modifying the computer surveillance logic to ensure that these units accommodate Mode C altitude input of
100-foot increments, and ensuring that the system will be tracked and coordinated by intruding aircraft when the
Mode S transponder CA field is set at CA=7. The conversion is onboard-loadable, or it may be accomplished at a field
repair shop. The first method involves data loading the TCAS II computer unit in the aircraft equipment bay using an
ARINC 615 or 603 data loader. The second method entails performing a final test, and then programming the TCAS II computer
unit to convert it to the latest enhanced version at a field repair shop.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice proposed that operators accomplish the modification requirements of this AD in accordance with a method
approved by the FAA. However, the FAA has reviewed and approved the Honeywell service bulletin discussed previously,
and has determined that accomplishment of this service bulletin is an appropriate method of compliance. Consequently,
the FAA has revised paragraph (a) of the final rule to cite the Honeywell service bulletin as the appropriate source
of service information, and has removed the language referring to accomplishing the actions ``in accordance with
a method approved by the FAA.'' Even though this language has been deleted from paragraph (a), operators may still
be permitted to accomplish the actions in accordance with an FAA-approved method under the provisions of paragraph
(c) of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of this new data and software developement, the FAA has revised the final rule by changing the reference to
Mitre letter F046&hyph;L&hyph;0056, dated July 20, 1993, which appeared in paragraph (a)(1) of the NPRM, to Mitre
letter F046&hyph;L&hyph;0069, dated September 21, 1993, since the latter identifies the enhanced software package.
Since the original Version 6.04A software was never issued, no operator could have installed that version. Therefore,
no redundant actions would be required on the part of any operator as a result of this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the enhanced Version 6.04A software introduces a change in the operation of the aircraft, the FAA also finds
that a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) is necessary as a conforming change to correspond with that new
software configuration. The AFM revision is advisory only, and will ensure that the flight crew is aware of the changes
associated with the new software installation. Consequently, paragraph (b) has been added to the final rule to reflect
this informational AFM revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received in response to the notice:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, Honeywell, objects to the proposed compliance date of December 30, 1993, and states that December
31, 1994, represents a more realistic compliance timeframe. Honeywell indicates that operators vary in their ability
to load the updated software due to maintenance and aircraft schedules and data-load/test resources. Honeywell
states that, although it has been working aggressively to implement the latest change, that change has resulted in
a delay in the date operators will be able to implement the latest change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other commenters also request that the FAA extend the proposed compliance date from 3 to 18 months after the
date specified in the proposal in order to accommodate implementation, verification, certification, and incorporation
of the proposed software change into existing installations. One commenter, the Air Transport Association (ATA)
of America, supports implementation of the latest enhanced Version 6.04A, and requests that the FAA issue a supplemental
notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to propose that this revised software be retrofitted by June 30, 1995. ATA contends
that significant differences exist between Version 6.04A and the latest enhanced version. Another commenter requests
that the FAA solicit comments from foreign agencies participating in TCAS evaluation and simulations to help ensure
that the proposed Version 6.04A revision will be compatible and acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs partially with these requests to extend the compliance time. The FAA has considered the safety implications,
the time necessary for approval of the enhanced Version 6.04A software, the size of the fleet, and normal maintenance
schedules for timely accomplishment of implementation of the modification. In light of these considerations, the
FAA has determined that a compliance date of December 31, 1994, is appropriate. Paragraph (a) of the final rule has
been revised to specify the revised compliance date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in response to the requests that a supplemental NPRM be issued and that further public comments be solicited,
the FAA submits the following. Comments received in response to the proposal reflect unanimous support for implementation
of the latest enhanced Version 6.04A software. The FAA considers the logic change (reduction of unnecessary crossing
RA's) incorporated in the enhanced software to be a minor change. The intent of this AD is to require that the addressed
unsafe condition be corrected by installing modified TCAS II computer units that incorporate updated CAS logic.
The FAA has determined that a requirement to implement Version 6.04A software, including the latest enhancement,
will meet that intent, will not alter the substance of the rule, and will impose no additional burden on any member of
the public. Additionally, issuance of a supplemental NPRM would necessitate (under the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the period for public comment, considering additional comments
received, and eventually issuing a final rule; the time required for that procedure may be as long as four additional
months. In light of this, and in consideration of the amount of time that has already elapsed since issuance of the original
NPRM, the FAA concludes that solicitation of further public comment is not necessary and that further delay of this
final rule action is not appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requests that the FAA require Honeywell TCAS II processors that are already installed be operated in
the ``traffic advisory (TA) only'' mode until the updated software package is installed. The commenter indicates
that ``possible hidden problems'' could exist between the different versions of logic that are installed currently
in the TCAS II processors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. Operation of currently installed TCAS II processors in the ``TA
only'' mode would impair the capability of those processors to alert the flight crew of appropriate aircraft maneuvers
that must be taken to prevent mid-air collisions. Further, the FAA is unaware of any ``possible hidden problems''
between the different versions of logic installed currently in the TCAS II processors, as suggested by the commenter.
Therefore, the FAA concludes that currently installed TCAS II processors should not be operated in the ``TA only''
mode until the updated software packaged is installed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests clarification of the unsafe condition specified in the proposed rule. This commenter points
out differences in the wording of the unsafe condition between this proposed rule and two existing proposals that
address the same CAS logic change for Rockwell International/Collins Air Transport Division (Collins), and Allied
Signal Aerospace Company/Air Transport Avionics (Allied Signal), TCAS II processors. From this comment, the FAA
infers that the commenter requests that the proposed statement of unsafe condition more closely parallels the statement
of unsafe condition in the other two proposals addressing the same subject.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs. The FAA has revised the unsafe condition specified in this final rule to coincide with the proposals
that address Collins and Allied Signal TCAS II processors to more explicitly reference safety considerations, as
follows: ``*&blank;*&blank;* to prevent collisions or near misses caused by incompatibility between the TCAS II
processors and the current air traffic control system.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, Falcon Jet Corporation, indicates that Honeywell TCAS II processors are installed on Mystere-Falcon
Model 50 and 900 series airplanes, and requests that these airplanes be included in the portion of the applicability
of the AD that lists airplanes on which this TCAS II processor may be installed. The FAA concurs with the commenter's
request and has revised the final rule accordingly. In addition, the FAA has become aware of other airplane models
affected by this AD and has included those models in that portion of the applicability statement of the final rule.
The FAA clarifies that, as stated in the preamble and the applicability of the proposal, the affected Honeywell TCAS
II processors are installed on various transport category airplanes and are not limited only to those airplanes listed
in the applicability of this AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters request that the FAA revise the economic impact information specified in the proposal to reflect
costs borne by suppliers, installers, and airline operators associated with development, testing, and certification
of the modified processor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur with the commenters' request to revise the economic impact information contained in this AD.
The appropriate number of hours required to accomplish the required actions, specified as 3 in the economic impact
information, below, was provided to the FAA by the processor manufacturer based on the best data available to date.
This number represents the time required to gain access, remove the existing processor, install a diskette containing
the revised software, and close up. The cost analysis in AD rulemaking actions typically does not include costs associated
with development, testing, and certification of a modified processor, as suggested by the commenter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 2,700 transport category airplanes in the worldwide fleet on which the Honeywell TCAS II
computer units may be installed. The FAA estimates that 1,150 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD,
that it will take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average
labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $189,750, or $165 per airplane. This
total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the requirements of this AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

International, Collins Air Transport Division 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Collins), Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(TCAS) II processors that are installed on aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action requires replacing the existing TCAS II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor with a new processor that incorporates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
updated computer logic or reprogramming certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors while they are still on board the aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of candidate enhancements to TCAS II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logic that improves its utility and increases its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall operational acceptance prompted the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action. The actions specified by this AD are intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent collisions or near misses caused by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incompatibility between the TCAS II processors and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received from 31 different owners, operators, manufacturers, and organizations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All commenters express their concern of the FAA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance date of December 30, 1993. The following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarizes the compliance times that the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;21 recommended one year or less; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;3 recommended longer than one year; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;7 recommended an extension without a proposed time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Air Traffic Controllers Association and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Airline Pilots Association both recommend an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``aggressive implementation'' of ``Change 6.04A''. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has re-evaluated the December 30, 1993, compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time and has determined that the compliance time should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be changed to December 31, 1994. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Change 6.04A'' has been upgraded to ``Change 6.04A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced'', which eliminates unnecessary non-crossing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution advisories (RA's) included in ``Change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.04A''. Collins has assured the FAA that (1) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upgrade to ``Change 6.04A Enhanced'' is minor and will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated in the logic change for the TCAS II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor upgrades; and (2) this compliance time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correlates with their schedule for disseminating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service information and kits necessary to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the incorporation of ``Change 6.04A Enhanced''. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD has been changed to reflect the compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time change and logic change described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter states that the affected aircraft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators should operate their TCAS II units in the ``TA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mode Only'' until the new logic is incorporated because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of possible hidden problems that could exist between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different logic versions currently installed. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not concur that these TCAS II units should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated in the ``TA Mode Only''. The information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by an RA may prove to be useful to the pilot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pilot has the option of whether to utilize the RA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommends referencing Collins Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bulletin (SB) No. 16, TTR&hyph;920&hyph;34&hyph;16, dated December 9, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993, as a way of complying with the proposed AD. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA concurs that this service information is a way of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complying with the proposed action, and has included a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
note in the final rule that so indicates this. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter proposes a change to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD that would allow reprogramming the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit on board the aircraft as a method of compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the proposed action. The FAA concurs that certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing TCAS II part numbers may be reprogrammed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the unit on board the aircraft. The proposed AD has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been modified to include this method on the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCAS II processor part numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that reference to the SAAB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
340B airplanes in the General Aviation Airplanes list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be deleted. This commenter also recommends that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the Aerospatiale ATR&hyph;42 and ATR&hyph;72 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes be moved from the General Aviation Airplanes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list to the Air Transport Airplanes list. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurs and has revised the proposed AD accordingly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, who supports the implementation of ``Change 6.04A Enhanced'', requests that the FAA issue a supplementary
notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to propose installing this revised software by June 30, 1995. This commenter
states that significant differences exist between ``Change 6.04A'' and ``Change 6.04A Enhanced''. The FAA does
not concur. Comments received in response to the proposed AD reflect unanimous support for implementing ``Change
6.04A Enhanced''. The FAA considers the logic change (which reduces non-crossing RA's) to be minor. The intent is
to correct the unsafe condition by installing modified TCAS II computer units that incorporate updated logic. The
FAA has determined that the requirement to implement Version 6.04A software, including the latest enhancement,
will (1) correct the unsafe condition; (2) maintain the same intent originally proposed without altering the substance
of the proposed rule; and (3) impose no additional burden on the public than was previously proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, issuing a supplemental NPRM would necessitate (under the provisions of the Administrative Procedures
Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the public comment period, considering any additional comments received,
and eventually issuing a final rule. The time required for these procedures could take as long as four additional months.
In light of this, and in consideration of the amount of time that has already elapsed since issuance of the original
NPRM, the FAA concludes that soliciting further public comment is not necessary and that further delay of the final
rule action is not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters request that the FAA revise the economic impact specified in the proposed AD to reflect costs associated
with the development, testing prior to certification, and certification of the modified processor. These costs
would be absorbed by suppliers, installers, and airline operators. The FAA does not concur that the economic impact
statement include this information. The 5 workhours necessary to accomplish the proposed action was provided to
the FAA by the TCAS II processor manufacturer based on the best data available to date. This number represents the time
required to install the revised software and test for proper operation after installation. The cost analysis in AD
rulemaking actions typically does not include costs associated with development, testing prior to certification,
and certification of a modified processor. The proposed action remains unchanged as a result of these comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of all available information including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that
air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the change in compliance
time, the logic reference change, the option of reprogramming certain units on board the aircraft, reference to Collins
SB No. 16, TTR&hyph;920&hyph;34&hyph;16, dated December 9, 1993, and minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined
that these changes and corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public
than was already proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 1,995 TCAS II processors in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
5 workhours per processor (1 workhour for installation and 4 workhours for operational testing) to accomplish the
required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $548,625. These figures are based on the assumption that none
of the operators of the airplanes equipped with the affected TCAS II processors have accomplished the actions specified
in this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action
is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is issuing a final rule adopting regulations to standardize
the content of, and procedures for accessing, information relevant to the availability of service on interstate
pipelines. The Commission's standards will require pipelines to make this information available on Electronic
Bulletin Boards (EBBs) and through downloadable files and will detail procedures and protocols for EBB operation
and file transfers.

 the Commission created a new operating environment for interstate pipelines and shippers on those pipelines by requiring
pipelines to unbundle the sale of gas from the transportation of that gas and by introducing a mechanism permitting
shippers to trade unneeded capacity through Electronic Bulletin Boards (EBBs) maintained by the pipelines. Because
shippers will now be transporting gas over multiple pipelines, the Commission concluded that the development of
uniform standards covering the content of, and methods for accessing, information relating to transportation would
improve the efficiency of gas movement across the interstate pipeline grid. To begin the process of developing the
needed standards, the Commission directed its staff to convene a series of informal conferences with all facets of
the gas industry to consider standards relating to capacity allocation. As a result of these conferences, the industry
reached consensus agreements on the information about available capacity that should be included on EBBs and the
procedures and protocols for making that information available.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is adopting a final rule reflecting the consensus agreements reached by the industry. The rule amends
the Commission's open access regulations by requiring pipelines to provide standardized information about the
availability of service on their systems. This information will be provided both on the pipelines' EBBs and through
files which users can download from the pipelines' computers to their own computers. The rule further requires pipelines
to provide this information according to standardized procedures and protocols, which will be maintained in a document
entitled ``Standardized Data Sets and Communication Protocols'' that can be obtained at the Commission. Pipelines
must implement the requirements of this rule by June 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also recognizes the standards and protocols it is adopting will need to be updated as more experience
with capacity release and the transportation environment under Order No. 636 is obtained. The Commission, therefore,
is proposing to continue the industry conferences to consider and propose modifications when needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Reporting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission estimates the public burden for the information requirement under this final rule_including the
one-time start-up burden related to pipeline EBBs_will average 6,770 hours per company. The burden estimate includes
the time required to review and implement the standards, develop the necessary software, search existing data sources,
gather and maintain the data needed, create/validate common and proprietary codes/information and complete and
review the information. The information/data elements required to be maintained on pipeline EBBs will be under a
new information requirement, FERC&hyph;549(B), Gas Pipeline Rates: Capacity Release Information. The annual
burden associated with the new FERC&hyph;549(B) information requirement will be 528,060 hours based on the estimated
initial EBB development burden and daily EBB informational updates by an anticipated 78 pipeline respondents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Included in the annual burden estimate are 40,560 hours (520 hours per company) attributable to the creation of common/proprietary
codes to identify pipelines and common transaction points. The codification requirements were not part of the burden
estimates contained in the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) issued July 29, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the final rule contains new information and EBB requirements, many of which are one-time start-up activities,
it is anticipated that FERC&hyph;549(B) burden will be reduced by 2,250 hours per respondent (for a total reduction
of 175,500 hours for all respondents) the year following the implementation of the EBB systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arkla Energy Resources Company and Mississippi River Transmission Corporation state that providing comments on
the burden estimate in the NOPR is difficult until final resolution of EBB issues. Interstate Natural Gas Association
of American states the burden estimate in the NOPR is reasonable for the items included in the proposed rule, but would
be too low if additional items, such as common codes are included. No party has submitted contrary data on a revised
burden estimate for the requirements proposed in the NOPR. The only significant change from the NOPR is the requirement
to create a common code data base and the Commission has revised its estimate to include the additional burden of this
effort. Accordingly, the Commission finds its burden estimates reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of this information requirement,
including suggestions for reductions of the burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol
Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415,
FAX (202) 208&hyph;2425]; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,
Washington, DC 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission].

III. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 636, the Commission required pipelines to establish EBBs to provide shippers with equal and timely access
to relevant information about the availability of service on their systems, including service available through
capacity release transactions and firm and interruptible capacity available directly from the pipeline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission recognized the efficiency of capacity allocation would be enhanced by standardizing both the content
of capacity release information and the methods by which shippers could access that information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 26, 1993, the Commission held a technical conference to examine the industry's efforts in standardizing
information content and communication procedures. The participants at the conference expressed a willingness
to establish a broad industry-wide working group to reach consensus on standards governing capacity release transactions.
The Commission subsequently established informal conferences with Commission staff and all interested members
of the gas industry to facilitate the development of consensus standards.

A broad spectrum of firms and organizations participated in these Working Groups, including representatives from
the major segments of the gas industry and other interested parties, such as computer and software firms. The participants
at the conferences divided their efforts into five working groups covering different areas of standardization and,
on July 1 and July 6, 1993, the Working Groups submitted reports on their deliberations. Working Groups 1 and 2 reached
consensus on proposed standardized data sets setting forth the information concerning available capacity. Working
Group 4 agreed on a set of communication protocols governing the dissemination of the information. Working Group
5 proposed methods for developing codes to identify companies and common transaction points, but had not finalized
standards in these areas. Working Group 3 reported on its progress in considering standards relating to business
practices other than capacity release, but did not propose any standards. The Working Group reports included minority
positions on several items. The Commission also provided an additional period for the public to comment on the Working
Group proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 29, 1993, the Commission issued a Notice Of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) proposing to adopt standards reflecting
the consensus agreements reached by the industry working groups.

IV. Summary of the Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule adopts the regulation and standards as proposed in the NOPR, with only slight modifications. The final
rule adopts &sect;284.8(b)(5) requiring pipelines to provide standardized information relevant to the availability
of service on their systems. Under the rule, pipelines must provide the standardized information on their EBBs and
provide users with the ability to download the standardized information in compliance with standardized procedures
and protocols. The rule provides that the details of the required information, procedures, and protocols will be
made available in a document entitled ``Standardized Data Sets and Communication Protocols,'' which would be available
from the Commission's Public Reference and Files Maintenance Branch.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the standardized information includes information relevant to the availability of interruptible transportation,
the rule also revises &sect;284.9(b)(4), which governs interruptible transportation, to cross-reference the
standardization requirements in &sect;284.8(b)(5).

 This information includes offers to sell firm capacity (either by the pipeline or releasing shippers), bids for capacity,
awards of capacity, withdrawals of capacity offers and bids, operationally available (i.e., interruptible) capacity,
and system-wide notices. The protocols establish principles and procedures relating to the operation of pipeline
EBBs and the provision of downloadable files to users. Under these protocols, pipelines will provide for file downloads
in two formats: one that complies with standards for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) promulgated by the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 and a second format that does not comply
with ASC X12, but which provides files in standard flat ASCII format.

On-line EBB refers to a continuous computer connection between a pipeline EBB and a user's computer in which the information
from the pipeline's computer is displayed visually on the user's computer and the user can enter data directly to the
pipeline's computer. File downloading refers to the transfer in computerized format of a file from the pipeline's
computer to the user's computer. The user can use its own internal computer programs to manipulate the data.

A. Need for a Flexible Mechanism To Make Revisions to the Standards and Protocols 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to proceed through rulemaking, rather than a policy statement, finding that
the benefits of standardization can be achieved only when all pipelines provide the same information through the
same procedures. The Commission concluded a rulemaking was the proper approach to issuing mandatory requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters support the Commission's issuance of a rule to ensure full compliance, but urge the Commission
to commit itself to a process for revising the requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 They maintain that once the industry obtains experience with capacity release, revisions may be needed. Natural
supports the use of notice and comment rulemaking, but it requests clarification that, even though the referenced
document of standards and protocols is not contained in the Code of Federal Regulations, any modifications to these
standards or protocols will be made through rulemaking procedures. It maintains changes to this document could result
in significant administrative burdens and costs and, therefore, contends the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)
requires that such changes be made only through a notice and comment rulemaking. O&amp;R and Williston urge the Commission
to proceed using a policy statement to ensure the utmost flexibility for modifications.

The Commission adheres to its determination to proceed through rulemaking to ensure the uniformity standardization
requires. Nevertheless, the Commission agrees with the commenters that revisions and modifications to the standards
and protocols will need to be made on a regular basis as the industry obtains more experience with capacity release
transactions and with the changed operating environment created by Order No. 636. For example, in the two months after
issuance of the NOPR, Working Groups 1 and 2 already have proposed revisions to the standardized data sets to ensure
that they function effectively and to clarify a number of items. The Commission proposes to continue the informal
conferences and the Working Groups as the best means for monitoring the performance of the standards and proposing
needed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the Commission's ability to respond to the need for changes, it adopted only a general regulation requiring
the pipelines to standardize their provision of capacity information, while the standards and protocols themselves
were to be provided in a separate document not contained in the Code of Federal Regulations. The Commission is committed
to making needed modifications and revisions to the standards and protocols as quickly as possible. Determining
the appropriate mechanism for making such changes is premature, because the method should vary depending on the type
of change contemplated; maintenance of the standards to correct problems or improve their functioning should be
handled differently than significant substantive changes in the means of providing the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making changes to the data sets and protocols, the Commission intends to follow the APA and provide notice and an
opportunity for comment, just as it has in the past with respect to proposed changes by the Working Groups. For example,
when Working Groups 1 and 2 submitted their recent set of revisions, the Commission noticed the filing and provided
an opportunity for written comments as well as for consideration of the revisions at one of the Commission's EBB conferences.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Commission is issuing the current data sets along with this rule, the Commission realizes that as pipelines
begin the process of correlating the downloadable data sets with the information provided by offerors and bidders
through their on-line EBBs, difficulties with the data sets may be identified. All pipelines immediately must begin
the correlation process, so they can report any significant difficulties to Working Groups 1 and 2. The Commission
is committed to implementing the data sets by June 1, 1994, and Working Groups 1 and 2, therefore, should ensure that
they provide the Commission with any additional changes they believe are essential in sufficient time to permit implementation
of the data sets, including ASC X12 downloadability, by that date. The Commission recognizes that the data sets may
not be perfect when implemented, but, as discussed above, the Commission is committed to a process for revising the
data sets on a regular basis after implementation.

Sabine maintains small pipelines may not be able to comply with the requirements outlined in the NOPR. It does not suggest
a blanket exemption for small pipelines, but instead recommends they be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate that
the costs of implementing the standards would outweigh the benefits of compliance.

The Commission recognizes small pipeline compliance with some of the requirements of the standards and protocols
may not be cost justified or essential to obtain the benefits the Commission sought to achieve through standardization.
The Commission cannot make a generic determination of the particular standards and protocols with which small pipelines
should not have to comply; compliance with some of the standards may not involve as much added cost as compliance with
others and partial compliance may still be of benefit to users.

C. Implementation Date
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NOPR, the Commission proposed an April 1, 1994 implementation date, finding this date would provide pipelines
with sufficient time to program their computers to incorporate the changes required and would permit final testing
of the system during the off-peak summer season. Many commenters support the April 1, 1994 implementation date, some
suggesting no extension be given.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Peoples Gas, et al., and UDC state this date should not result in delay in implementing the on-line EBBs already required
by Order No. 636. Some commenters contend the April 1, 1994 date is sufficient for the items included in the NOPR, but
would not give sufficient time for implementation of additional requirements resulting from the Working Groups'
February 1, 1994 reports on those items which the Commission set for further consideration.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Other commenters contend the April 1, 1994 date is too ambitious for all items and assert the Commission should not
set an interim date, but should require full implementation by the fall of 1994.

 AER/MRT contends an April 1, 1994 implementation date for the ASC X12 requirement, in particular, is unreasonably

The Commission will agree to delay the implementation date to June 1, 1994, to allow the Working Groups and the pipelines
to make final revisions that will improve the functioning of the EBBs and the downloadable data sets. But, given this
extension, the Commission expects the pipelines to have an operational set of standards fully implemented by June
1, 1994. At the same time, the June 1, 1994 date will permit capacity release transactions, which may be significant
in the off-peak season, to benefit from the standards. The June 1, 1994 date applies to the implementation of EDI, but
not to the implementation of common codes, as discussed later.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission clarifies that this date applies only to the items included in this rule, not to further items resulting
from the February 1, 1994 reports. The June 1, 1994 date also does not delay pipelines' compliance with the EBB requirements
of Order No. 636; pipelines must comply with these requirements by the date specified in their restructuring orders.

The June 1 date is not an interim date, but the final date for compliance with these requirements. The reference in the

to uncover lacunae in operation not detected during routine small scale (or beta) testing of the system.

later than the June 1, 1994 date.

Williston Basin asserts the February 1, 1994 date for the Working Group reports is premature since the industry will
not have sufficient experience with capacity release by then to make additional modifications. The Commission is
not persuaded to change the February 1 date for the Working Group reports. These reports are intended to cover the items
on which the parties did not have the time to reach consensus in time for their July reports, but which the Commission
found were susceptible to resolution given more time. As discussed earlier, the Commission is committed to updating
these standards when necessary in light of experience. The timing of additional meetings or reports to consider further
revisions are better made at a later point.

D. Modifications to the Regulatory Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NGSA and Process Gas Consumers Group suggest the rule should be revised to require each pipeline to submit a compliance
filing specifying in its tariff the details of how it will supply the services required by the rule. UDC suggests the
imposition of reporting requirements to permit the Commission and the public to monitor the initial operation of
EBBs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission perceives no need at this point for requiring compliance filings by pipelines or the submission of
periodic reports. The requirements of the rule are straight-forward. The communication protocols require pipelines
to provide users with scripts detailing the procedures for accessing (logging-on to) the pipelines' computer systems,
and providing further detail through tariff filings seems unnecessary. Monitoring of the system can be better accomplished
through Commission oversight of pipelines' compliance by accessing their EBBs and through the use of industry conferences
than through tariff filings or inflexible periodic reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Process Gas Consumers Group suggests the deletion of the phrase ``on its Electronic Bulletin Board'' from the opening
clause of the rule. It contends this phrase suggests the rule may not cover EDI access to data, may not apply to pipelines
using third-party vendors to provide EBB services, and appears to require pipelines to provide information about
accessing their EBB solely through their EBB, thereby creating a Catch-22 in which shippers can obtain information
on how to access a pipeline's EBB only by knowing how to access the EBB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will not delete the reference to Electronic Bulletin Boards because pipelines must provide the required
information on their EBBs as well as through downloadable files. The Commission, however, will modify the regulation
slightly to make even more explicit that both modes of communication must be provided. The Commission expects pipelines
to provide users with instructions for accessing their EBBs or using EDI transfers without having the user first access
the pipelines' EBB.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposed to set forth the information on capacity availability and the protocols governing the dissemination
of that information in a separate document entitled Standardized Data Sets and Communication Protocols that would
be available at the Commission. The Commission included this document in the NOPR and commenters raised issues with
respect to the proposed provisions.

El Paso requests clarification that a pipeline can leave fields in the data sets blank if the pipeline's tariff does
not require the information to be provided. It cites, as an example, differences in pipelines' tariffs as to whether
volumetric releases are subject to minimum quantity requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANR contends the definitions of the terms mandatory and optional, as used for some fields in the data sets, are confusing.
It submits mandatory refers to data fields that every pipeline must support, while optional refers to data fields
pipelines may offer at their discretion, unless their individual tariffs require that those fields be supported.
If optional means that all pipelines must support the field, thereby permitting releasing shippers or bidders with
the option of including information in the field, ANR asserts it would have to incur added expense to redesign its EBB
to include these fields.

As an example of the difference in definition, an optional field is releaser contract number. Data Set I.1, line 6.

pipelines must provide the field so releasing shippers have the ability to include the information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Commission understands that El Paso's and ANR's interpretation of the manner in which the data sets
are designed to operate accords with the intent of the Working Groups, and the Commission agrees with that approach.
The Commission, however, sees a need to provide further clarification of the operation of the data sets and the mandatory
and optional characterization of certain fields. At the outset, it is important to recognize that these data sets
must apply to all pipelines, and, therefore, the Working Groups had to design them to be flexible enough to accommodate
the different operational characteristics and information requirements of different pipelines. Implementation
of the data sets perforce will differ across pipelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data sets are organized along the following lines. First, they are divided into generic groups for offers, bids,
awards, withdrawals, operationally available capacity, and system wide notices. Some of these groups are then divided
into specialized data sets, for example for receipt and delivery point information or for storage releases. Each
of these subsets contain mandatory, optional, or contingent fields.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All pipelines must support the six broad categories of data sets. Pipeline support of the subsets within each category,
however, may depend on the operational characteristics of individual pipelines.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 For example, data sets are included for receipt and delivery point information and for segment information although
not all pipelines are segment systems. Pipelines will choose from among the combination of these data sets the ones
that best present the relevant information for their systems.

The easiest example is the storage data sets which obviously will not have to be supported by pipelines without storage
fields.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All pipelines choosing a particular data set will be required to support the mandatory fields in that data set. Pipelines
are not required by this rule to support the optional fields. Some pipelines, however, may be required by their tariffs
or other requirements, to support some of the optional fields.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, pipelines must display all information, whether mandatory or optional, on their on-line EBBs. For example,
if a pipeline is not now displaying mandatory information on its on-line EBB, it must revise its display format to accommodate
that information.

As mentioned earlier, the Working Groups are continuing to make refinements in the data sets. In making these refinements,
they should make a further effort to clarify how pipelines must implement these requirements, such as which fields
pipelines must support and which are optional.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enron suggests the standardized data sets should be minimum requirements that pipelines can supplement to accommodate
tariff provisions. As an example, it claims the data sets do not accommodate Florida Gas' proposal to permit several
shippers temporarily to combine their capacity rights to facilitate release transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is not sure what flexibility Enron is requesting. Pipelines cannot add or delete fields from the capacity
data sets because standardization requires that all pipelines use the same structure for downloading, so shippers
can process that information using the same computer software. For example, if pipelines could add new data fields,
shippers' ASC X12 software might be unable to interpret the information because the software is keyed to the specific
fields on the implementation guide. Moreover, the Working Groups anticipated the need to accommodate special release
offers or unique circumstances and included special terms and miscellaneous note fields for providing such details.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 As discussed previously, the Commission recognizes that pipelines may uncover difficulties in correlating their
information requirements with the downloadable data sets and the Commission anticipated possibly having to make
corrections to the data sets. The best way for pipelines to avoid problems is to begin the implementation process immediately
so they can report difficulties to the Working Groups for resolution prior to implementation.

Enron did not describe the specific problem created by combination offers, and the Commission cannot discern why
it could not be accommodated within the prescribed data sets. For example, the combination offer could be assigned
a single offer number (Data Set I.1, line 3) with any special circumstances described in the miscellaneous field (Data
Set I.1, line 52).

2. Date and Time Stamps
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal put forward by Working Groups 1 and 2 included fields identifying the date and time when release offers,
bids, withdrawals of bids or offers, and capacity awards are posted on pipelines' EBBs. No consensus was reached over
whether fields should be included to identify when pipelines actually received offers, bids, or withdrawals or made
the determination to award capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NOPR proposed to require the inclusion of fields for bid receipt date and time, but not for the date and time offers
and withdrawals were received or capacity awarded. Since releasing shippers and pipelines may choose the first come,
first served method to break ties, the Commission found that routine posting of the bid receipt date and time would
permit shippers to verify the award of capacity without having to contact the pipeline. The Commission did not propose
to include the date and time fields for receipt of offers and withdrawals or capacity awards, concluding this information
was not as important to capacity release transactions as the bid information. The Commission stated, however, that
information about the date and time offers and withdrawals were received and capacity awards determined must be provided
by the pipelines upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters support the Commission's decision to include only the information about bid receipt in the standardized
data sets.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some request clarification as to whether pipelines must include both the date and time bids are received and posted
as mandatory fields.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Process Gas Consumers Group contends the Commission should require inclusion of all the contested items. It contends
the date and time for receipt of capacity withdrawals is particularly important because releasing shippers have
only a limited right to withdraw offers; it maintains the date and time information is needed so bidders can determine
whether that right has been exercised validly. It contends pipelines easily can make all the contested information
available in electronic form. The National Registry requests that even if pipelines are not required to post information
concerning the receipt of offers and withdrawals and determination of capacity awards, they should be required to
provide this information in electronic form when requested.

The Commission adheres to its decision not to require pipelines routinely to post the receipt date and time for capacity
offers and withdrawals and the date and time capacity awards are made. The Working Groups could not reach agreement
on providing the additional information, and, as stated in the NOPR, the Commission does not find that this information
is as crucial to capacity release, or will be needed as frequently, as the bid information. The Commission will not
require pipelines to provide the additional information in electronic form, because such a requirement would not
be significantly different than requiring the routine, electronic posting of this information, which the Commission
has determined is not necessary. The ability of users to obtain the information for offers, withdrawals, and awards
upon request appears sufficient. The Commission clarifies that both the bid receipt and bid posting data fields are
mandatory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PEC Pipeline Group contends the date and time for bids should be the posting time, arguing if receipt date and time is
used, the information would be unreliable because the bids would not have been verified for accuracy. It maintains
only the date and time of verified bids should be used to break ties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission agrees, in principle, that the appropriate information to include is the date and time used to break
ties. However, in most instances, that will be the date and time bids are received, not when they are verified. For example,
when bids are submitted near the end of bidding periods, the pipeline may not verify the bids until after the bid window
closes. Under a first come, first served tie breaking system, capacity would be awarded to the highest bid received
first in time even if the bid was not verified until later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Operationally Available Capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposed to adopt the Working Group's consensus agreement that pipelines provide information on
the amount of unscheduled capacity available at specific locations, such as receipt and delivery points, mainline,
or mainline segments. This field serves to identify the capacity that would be available as interruptible service
from the pipeline. Edison contends this definition would not allow shippers to determine whether firm or interruptible
capacity is available. It suggests operationally available capacity be defined as the capacity a firm shipper can
nominate at a point, asserting this definition would include interruptible capacity that can be displaced by a firm
shipper. Transco contends the amount of unscheduled capacity is proprietary information that would not be provided
in the free market. Williston Basin does not oppose this requirement, but states shippers may be able to use this information
only for trend analysis, not for making decisions on a daily basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds the requirement to provide information on operationally available or unscheduled capacity
is necessary to comply with the requirement that pipelines identify the interruptible capacity available on their
systems.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
28
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The unscheduled capacity at a point reveals the capacity available as interruptible service. In response to Edison's
comment, the Commission finds that the consensus approach is adequate at this point to disclose both the firm and interruptible
capacity available to potential shippers. The operationally available capacity reveals interruptible service
and pipelines also are required to post the firm service they have available.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
29
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Working Groups still are considering issues relating to operationally available capacity, and the Commission
will be open to modification of this definition if needed.

For example, the Commission is not certain whether Edison and Transco principally are concerned with the definition
of operationally available (or unscheduled) capacity or with the different, albeit somewhat related, issue of whether
additional fields are required to divide scheduled (or nominated) capacity into firm and interruptible components.
The issue of identifying the firm and interruptible components of nominated capacity is still under deliberation
by the Working Groups, and Edison and Transco will have a further opportunity to address these issues in the Working
Group meetings.

ANR asserts that the data field for operationally available capacity should indicate that the data may be estimates.
It also suggests an additional data field to enable the pipeline to qualify the accuracy of any information. The Commission
agrees with ANR that the information in this field may be estimates and leaves to the Working Groups the decision on
whether another field is necessary to convey information about how the estimates are provided.

As discussed earlier, NGSA suggested pipelines be required to make compliance filings and it submits that these filings
include information on the locations at which operationally available information will be provided, the manner
of display, and the timeliness of the data. WEV suggests generally that the information provided under the data sets
be as current as the pipeline can provide. While pipelines will not be required to make compliance filings to implement
this rule, they should provide users with adequate information about the locations at which they are reporting the
information and the timeliness of the information, which should be as current as is possible. Since the Commission
will have access to the pipelines' EBBs, it can monitor the adequacy of the information pipelines provide.

4. Disclosure of Minimum Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hadson contends the Commission should eliminate the field providing for disclosure of minimum price terms (Data
Set I.1, lines 23 and 24). It contends disclosure of this information while the market is open facilitates collusion
among releasing shippers to maintain higher prices in a falling market. The Commission will not eliminate this field
because it comports with the Commission's policy of providing releasing shippers with the option of having their
minimum conditions posted on the EBB.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This technical proceeding is not the proper forum to reexamine the Commission's policy in this regard. The Commission
notes, however, that, in a free market, sellers can choose to disclose minimum price conditions if they find such disclosure
beneficial. For example, stating a minimum price protects against the possibility a deal will fail simply because
a buyer submits a bid lower than the minimum price even though it is willing to pay the minimum price if it had known this
condition. Moreover, since minimum price terms are public, the Commission can monitor the situation, and eliminate
this field, if experience shows it does facilitate collusion.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 ASC X12 standards provides an electronic data submission capability that allows computers to exchange information
over communication lines using standardized formats. To facilitate these transfers, the ASC X12 standards provide
standardized transaction sets for different types of transactions, such as requests for quotations and responses
to such requests.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

transaction sets must be customized to individual applications by correlating or ``mapping'' the specific information

A few comments address the proposed implementation date for ASC X12. Tenneco asserts the April 1, 1994 implementation
date should not include EDI compliance, because EDI should be implemented only when trading partners agree. AER/MRT
suggest the date is too ambitious for ASC X12 implementation. PEC Pipeline Group maintains ANSI must approve the implementation
guide developed by Gas*Flow and asserts obtaining this approval could affect the timing of ASC X12 implementation
as well as the commitment of ASC X12 software vendors to guarantee the use of their software with these data sets. Despite
these concerns, PEC Pipeline Group is willing to go forward and implement ASC X12 based on Gas*Flow's recommendations.

Tenneco argues no implementation date for ASC X12 be set, contending implementation should occur when trading partners
agree. As the comments suggest, EBB operators need lead time to modify their system to incorporate ASC X12 downloads.
The Commission, therefore, concludes it needs to set a date by which ASC X12 downloads will be available to ensure that
users wanting this service can obtain it expeditiously. As specified by Working Group 4, the details of any special
arrangements for access to ASC X12 data between the pipeline and a trading partner would be worked out between those
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters address the Commission's proposal to use Gas*Flow to prepare the implementation guide. UDC and
Tenneco support the use of Gas*Flow, but Tenneco suggests the Gas*Flow documentation should be submitted to the Working
Groups prior to submission to the Commission. Columbia Gas believes the Commission's estimate of one month for Gas*Flow
to prepare the implementation guide is overly optimistic and provides too little opportunity for the industry to
participate in development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission expects Gas*Flow to continue its current procedure of receiving industry comment on its proposed
implementation guide and to submit the guide to the Working Groups for their final approval. The extension of the implementation
date until June 1, 1994, provides Gas*Flow with sufficient time to obtain industry input and still finalize the implementation
guide in time for the industry to meet the June 1, 1994 date. Working Groups 1 and 2 and Gas*Flow should coordinate their
efforts to ensure that any additional revisions made by the Working Groups in the data sets are made in sufficient time
to ensure that EBB operators can implement the ASC X12 downloads by June 1, 1994. Once the implementation guide is completed,
the Commission will include the guide with its data sets.

 They generally argue mandating a second download in ASCII format is not worth the increased expense and maintain the
resources could be better devoted to development of ASC X12. They recommend ASCII downloads should remain a pipeline
option, as proposed by Working Group 4. AER/MRT and Northwest, on the other hand, recommend ASCII downloads replace
ASC X12, contending that ASCII is less costly, and faster and more efficient to implement than ASC X12 and that their
customers prefer ASCII to ASC X12. Others support the Commission's proposal of maintaining ASCII as an adjunct to
ASC X12 since some users may not have ASC X12 capability and ASCII would ensure those users could download the data.

The Commission will not substitute ASCII downloads for ASC X12 as suggested by Northwest and AER/MRT. Even if ASCII
downloads would be less expensive to prepare initially, as Northwest and AER/MRT contend, the consensus of the industry
was to provide for download capability using ASC X12 because it provided significant benefits when compared with
downloads using ASCII format. Some of these benefits include the availability of already standardized and well-accepted
procedures and the concomitant software and businesses available to implement the technology. The Commission anticipates
that, as ASC X12 is more widely used in the gas industry, users will recognize the advantages to using ASC X12, as they
have in other industries, and it will become the industry standard for communication. Nevertheless, to ease the transition
to ASC X12 for those customers not yet familiar with the ASC X12 technology, the Commission will require EBB operators
to provide for downloading capability in a flat ASCII format as well.

2. Protocols for Communications Software and Hardware, Access Requirements, and Log-On Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters raise questions about the Commission's proposed protocols relating to the software and modem speeds
used to access EBBs, the requirements for obtaining access to EBBs, and the procedures and principles for logging-on
to computers. Columbia Distribution argues the Commission's proposed protocols fail to reflect two principles
to which the pipelines agreed: the pipelines' recognition of the need to develop a mechanism under which users can
log-on to multiple EBBs with one phone call; and their commitment to work in good faith to address other customer concerns,
such as log-on procedures, additional file transfer options, and other logistical concerns. IPAA suggests a standardized
basic user interface must be developed, as opposed to each pipeline specifying a different communications package.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the statements mentioned by Columbia Distribution reflected a goal for future discussions, rather than
a consensus on specific procedures or principles, the Commission did not include them in its current protocols. The
Commission recognizes that further standardization of access requirements could reduce the burden on users which
have to access many pipeline EBBs. But Working Group 4 concluded, from its review of pipeline EBBs, that adoption of
one standard communication package for accessing EBBs was made impracticable at this time by the proliferation of
different hardware and other operating considerations used by the various pipeline EBBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Instead, it reached consensus on the principle that each EBB operator must provide a script detailing its log-on procedures
which is compatible with the software package used to access the EBB and must provide for file downloads through VANs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
41
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission, therefore, will not require further standardization in this area at this time, but will leave any
such modifications to the continuing Working Group deliberations.

Columbia Distribution also asserts some pipelines are proposing to make electronic contracting mandatory for certain
transactions; it contends electronic contracting raises legal and business practice issues that should be addressed

Northwest contends the Commission should not require pipelines to support the 2400 baud modem speed because any speed
slower than 9600 baud will place too great a burden on the EBB communication network. It recommends each pipeline be
able to choose the appropriate modem speed so long as it identifies the hardware necessary to access the EBB. Working
Group 4 reached consensus on the principle that pipelines must support a minimum modem speed so all potential users
will have reasonable access to the EBBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
43
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission will not disturb the consensus, since Working Group 4's rationale is reasonable and the Commission

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission recognizes that modem speeds higher than 9600 are in use. The Commission is amending the protocols
to provide that EBB operators supporting such higher modem speeds must comply with the recognized national or international
standards governing modem communication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transco recommends changes to three of the communication protocols. First, it argues the Commission should clarify
that the requirement for 24-hour EDI access (protocol ID) is subject to two separate contingencies, required periodic
maintenance and unpredicted downtime. The Commission sees no need to change this language from what was proposed
by Working Group 4; the possibility of unforseen events causing computer problems is well understood and need not
be addressed separately. Second, Transco contends the Commission's proposed language on advance authorization
for third-party access to commercially sensitive data (protocol IIIA) is unclear because it does not specify that
the pipeline's customer must provide the authorization.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
44
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission agrees that the customer must authorize access to commercially sensitive data and will modify this
principle accordingly. Third, Transco asserts the Commission's proposed language for log-on scripts (protocol
IVB) does not reflect the principle put forward by Working Group 4, because it fails to make clear that the script for
customized software packages is part of the customized package, not a separate software code. The Commission will
modify this protocol to reflect this principle.

C. Common Codes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NOPR, the Commission found the post-Order No. 636 business environment and the computerization of capacity
release transactions required the development of common, standardized codes in two areas: Codes to identify companies;
and common transaction point codes to enable shippers to use a single coding structure to identify pipeline points,
particularly interconnect points between pipelines. Working Group 5 had identified, but had not finalized, a process
for developing both sets of codes. In the NOPR, the Commission stated that it expected Working Group 5 to finalize its
proposal for common company codes by February 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For common transaction points, Working Group 5 proposed an approach in which a third-party (code assignor) would
prepare a computerized cross-reference table correlating pipelines' proprietary codes (as verified and updated
by the pipelines) to a common code. Those wanting to use the common code would maintain the cross-reference table on
their computers and could convert proprietary pipeline codes to the common code, and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vice versa.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission was concerned about the feasibility of this process, at least in the short term, because Working Group
5 had not worked out the details of the approach (such as how to select a code assignor, pay for the costs of the initial
assignment and continued maintenance, or distribute the code) and had suggested this process be undertaken by a yet
undeveloped gas industry standards board. Due to the importance of this issue, the Commission gave the Working Group
until October 1, 1993, to finalize this approach or reach another consensus approach. If no consensus was reached,
the Commission proposed to select a common code and require the pipelines to make the translation to the common code.
The Commission requested comments on whether it should adopt the PI&hyph;GRID code developed by the Petroleum Information
Corporation or another common code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters support the development of a common code and the selection of the PI&hyph;GRID code if consensus on
an alternative is not reached.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
45
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Columbia Distribution and Exxon contend the pipelines, not the users, should make the translation. Pipelines contend
that requiring them to make the translation to the common code would increase costs significantly, because it would
affect all their computer operations, such as those for accounting, scheduling, and management, which are based
on the use of proprietary codes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 They assert Commission selection of the common code could impede the cooperative efforts of the industry to date and
recommend the Commission permit Working Group 5 to continue its efforts.

On October 12, 1993, Working Group 5 filed its report which detailed its consensus agreement on a code assignor process
along the lines of its previous proposal. As discussed below, the Commission is adopting the Working Group's proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The common code structure proposed by the Working Group would consist of two components. The first would be the code
number itself, a 16 digit number, which according to the Working Group, would provide the user with some information
about each point.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
47
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The second is a common code data base consisting of data elements that will be associated with each common code. These
data elements include such information as the name of the point, the owner operator of the point, a flow indicator showing
the direction of gas flow at the point, and a point locator (e.g., geographic coordinates, survey coordinates, or
line number or mile marker) to be provided when the information is available.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, for each non-well facility point, the first two numbers indicate the state; the second three, the county;
the next five a surface location within the state; the next two, the facility code; the next two, a sub number identifying
components of certain types of facilities (e.g., gas plant inlets from tailgates); and the final two, a detail number
identifying multiple facilities at the same location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal, PI&hyph;GRID will be the code assignor and will provide a copy of the data base to any requestor
at a price reflecting only its distribution and handling costs. The Working Group also proposes that various Code
Distributors will enter into agreements with PI&hyph;GRID to distribute the code. These agreements would provide
that the Code Distributors would not be able to charge for the data base itself, but would be able to charge for other
``value added'' services, such as selective extraction of information from the data base.

The Working Group envisions a series of contracts, beginning with a master agreement between PI&hyph;GRID and a consortium
of the gas industry. If a gas industry standards board eventually is developed, it would then take over this contract.
PI&hyph;GRID would enter into contracts based on the master agreement with Code Distributors, and the Code Distributors
would enter into agreements with users specifying the services Distributor will provide.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on discussions with PI-GRID, the Working Group anticipates six months will be required to establish and validate
the common codes for a large majority of interstate pipelines. If the industry begins the coding process this winter,
the Working Group expects the creation of a complete common code data base by the 1994&hyph;95 winter heating season.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, all business will be transacted with pipelines using proprietary codes. Those wanting to use
the common code will have to program their computers to translate between common and proprietary codes to communicate
with pipelines. Pipelines will be required to verify and validate their proprietary code information to PI-GRID.
The proposal also provides for ongoing assignment of new transaction points and modifications to existing points.
The information for these revisions must be provided at least ten days before a new or modified code goes into effect.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group states that, at this point, the demand for common codes is unknown; some parties using only one or
a small number of pipelines may prefer to continue using proprietary codes. Given this level of uncertainty, the Working
Group contends the code assignor process provides a number of benefits compared to a requirement that all pipelines
adopt a common code. It provides a verified and validated common code system to those who need it, while ensuring that
the costs of using common codes are borne by the users, not those still preferring to use proprietary codes. It will
provide consistent communication between pipelines and customers using proprietary codes, avoiding the difficulties
that would be created if business transactions and other customer contacts employed different coding systems. And,
it will provide an initial first test of the level of demand for, and efficiency of using, a common code. Should a common
code prove efficient, the Working Group expects the market to evolve to the point where common codes will be used for
all communications.

3. Comments on the Working Group Filing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Process Gas Consumers Group and NYMEX/Enersoft raise objections to the code assignor process. Process Gas Consumers
Group objects to the shipper having the responsibility for maintaining a rather large data set on its computer and
having to develop, or acquire from others, the ``intelligence'' needed to compare capacity release offers among
pipelines to identify possible alternative transportation paths.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It maintains that the most burdensome task facing pipelines is verifying their proprietary codes and that including
the common code in the capacity release data sets would not be particularly burdensome. It emphasizes that including
such codes in the data sets would be for informational purposes only, and would not require the pipelines to conduct
business using the common codes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
It also suggests that a common code system could include mile markers or other geographic location information so
software could identify delivery points either upstream or downstream of a location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NYMEX/EnerSoft contend pipelines should not be able to require customers to communicate using proprietary codes,
because users will then have to obtain translation software to convert the common codes to the proprietary codes.
It maintains that having the pipelines perform the translation is preferable since there are fewer pipelines than
market participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other commenters support the code assignor process. AER/MRT supports the use of proprietary codes for communication
between pipelines and users, because use of one code will minimize the likelihood of miscommunication. It also argues
requiring shippers to perform the translation appropriately requires those using common codes to bear the costs
of that use. Gaslantic contends the Commission should ensure that initial and updated common codes are distributed
on an open-access basis, and IPAA similarly supports the provision of the data base without cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Registry suggests two clarifications. It is concerned about the possibility that PI-GRID, as code assignor,
might delay distribution of the code in order to degrade the value of services provided by competitors. It suggests
PI-GRID should be required to file a letter with the Commission when it has completed more than 90% of the cross-referencing
for each pipeline and provide the code to distributors at that point. It further contends that information on the location
of points (such as geographic coordinates or pipeline line number of mile marker) is critical, but that the proposed
data sets requires this information to be included only when available. It maintains the Commission should clarify
when this information must be provided, suggesting it should be supplied for path pipelines, but not for point-to-point
or network pipelines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In line with this request, it suggests the Commission require pipelines to include in their next Form 567 filing an
identification of the proprietary point code associated with the points in the flow diagrams.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given the level of support for the code assignor process, the Commission accepts the Working Group proposal and will
implement it by requiring pipelines to provide a mechanism through which any person can obtain a validated computerized
data base that will provide the ability to convert from pipeline proprietary codes to a common code. The Working Group
stated the code assignment process could be completed by the start of the 1994&hyph;95 winter heating season, and
the Commission, therefore, will require the implementation of this approach by November 1, 1994. The Commission
also will require pipelines to ensure that the common codes and data base, and any updates, will be provided without
charge, except for reasonable distribution and handling fees.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will adopt the data sets as proposed by the Working Group with one modification. The Commission will
require that the point locator information be mandatory. The Commission agrees with the commenters that the ability
to locate pipeline points in relation to other points on the system is important if users are to use the common code data
base to determine if a package of released capacity fits their needs. When pipelines verify their proprietary codes
to PI-GRID, they must include information sufficient to enable users to locate a point on one pipeline in relation
to other points. At this point, the pipelines can choose the method of locating the points, such as geographic coordinates,
line number or line marker, but the Commission envisions that eventually all pipelines should move to using geographic
coordinates so that points on different pipelines can be related to each other. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gaslantic and IPAA support the provision of the data base and updates at no cost to the user. The Working Group report
states distributors cannot charge more than postage and handling costs for providing the code itself, but can charge
for value added services. The Commission is requiring the pipelines to ensure that users can obtain the data base and
any updates at a price that reflects only reasonable costs of distribution and handling. Additional charges, however,
may be assessed for other value added services relating to updates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement that point locator information be mandatory for all pipelines obviates the requests by the National
Registry for a further definition of the term ``available'' to describe when point locator information will be provided
and for requiring point location disclosure in Form 567 filings. The provision of point locator information also
should satisfy Process Gas Consumers Group's request for geographic location points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Registry suggests that the Commission require PI-GRID to file a statement with the Commission when it
has completed more than 90% of the cross-referencing for each pipeline and provide the code to distributors at that
point. The Commission has set a deadline for final dissemination of the common code data base and finds no reason to
require filings as the data are compiled or piecemeal implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NYMEX/Enersoft contend pipelines should be required to conduct business using common codes. The Commission will
not impose this requirement at this time, since it goes beyond the consensus agreement reached by Working Group 5.
Shippers will be able to use the cross-reference table to convert electronically from the common codes to the proprietary
codes for communication with the pipeline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Process Gas Consumers Group maintains that including the common codes in the capacity release data sets would be more
efficient, although they do not suggest pipelines be required to conduct business using the common code. This suggestion
too goes beyond the consensus agreement reached by the Working Groups, and the Commission will not impose it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, even if the common code (consisting of 16 digits) was included in the capacity release data sets, the efficiency
of the process might not be enhanced to a significant degree. The extensive data base that goes along with the common
code would not be on the EBBs, and users may very well need the underlying data base to provide the information they require
to perform an analysis of capacity paths. As described earlier, the sequence of numbers in the code itself provides
users only with limited information, such as identifying the state and county of the point. But the entire common code
data base provides additional information about points, such as the point locator information, that users may well
need to use the common code effectively in comparing capacity releases over multiple pipelines. The Commission further
notes that Working Groups 1 and 2 have included an optional field for common codes which pipelines may make available
to their users. Use of this field may provide a test of whether bidders would derive value from access to the common code
numbers, without also having the underlying data base available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, the Commission finds that the industry has taken a positive step forward by designing a process that
will ensure that those wanting to use common codes can do so effectively within a reasonable period of time. The Commission
expects use of this system will prove to enhance efficiency by better enabling shippers to manage the transportation
of gas supplies across the nationwide pipeline grid. As pipelines review and update their computer and financial
systems in light of the changed business environment created by Order No. 636, the Commission expects them to incorporate
the use of common codes. Ultimately, the Commission anticipates that the common codes ultimately will become the
standard used for all transactions and communications between pipelines and their customers.

VII. Issues not Addressed in the Standardized Data Sets and Communication Protocols
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Working Group reports included minority positions on some issues, and these issues also were addressed in the
comments on the Working Group reports. On several issues, the Commission recommended that the Working Groups continue
their efforts to seek resolution, with reports to be made by February 1, 1994. Others involved policy questions which
the Commission found were beyond the scope of this proceeding and would be better examined in other fora.

A. Proposed Additions to the Standardized Data Sets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Index of Purchasers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Registry proposed that an Index of Purchasers (Index), which would disclose a variety of information
about the capacity rights of firm capacity holders, be available on EBBs and through downloadable files.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It asserted this index could be used to establish the baseline contractual rights of current holders of pipeline capacity,
information which it believed was needed so potential purchasers could determine the releasable rights of firm capacity
holders. In the NOPR, the Commission did not propose to include the proposed Index because the proposal appeared too
burdensome and costly. But the Commission stated it considered a more limited Index to have value in identifying firm
shippers with releasable capacity. It suggested the Working Groups work on a cost-effective method of presenting
such information.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters contend the benefits of an Index do not warrant the cost, since shippers willing to release capacity
are free to post offers to sell and potential purchasers can post so-called want ads, advertising the capacity they
want to acquire.

The Commission will not decide this issue now because it is still being considered by the Working Groups. But the Commission
continues to find merit in the concept of providing a cost-effective electronic Index of purchasers and expects the
participants in the Working Groups to consider this issue in the same open-minded and conciliatory manner they used
to build consensus on other issues in this proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also did not propose to make data items for contract number and replacement contract number mandatory
fields, finding that these items were tied to the proposed Index.
<FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>
 The National Registry contends its request to make contract and replacement contract numbers mandatory fields is
independent of the Index. It asserts these data are needed by the Commission, state commissions, and others to create
an audit trail to verify the ownership of capacity being released and acquired.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Commission will not require the inclusion of contract and replacement contract number in the data sets
at this time, it does recognize that pipelines will need to maintain a correlation between release transactions and
the contracts resulting from those transactions for Commission audit requirements if not also for the pipelines'
own purposes. Since pipelines must maintain this information in any event, the Working Groups should consider making
this information mandatory in the downloadable data sets to make access easier.

2. Nominations for Firm and Interruptible Capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No consensus was reached in the Working Groups whether to include fields showing confirmed firm and interruptible
nominations and a field showing whether no-notice service is available at a location. Proponents of providing this
information contended it was needed for releasing shippers and bidders to assess the value of released capacity,
while opponents maintained it is not needed to bid on capacity, but would unfairly tilt the market in favor of bidders.
The parties also disagreed on the availability, and costs, of providing the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NOPR, the Commission found that the available information did not permit it to resolve the issue. Moreover,
the Commission recognized the Working Groups had little time to consider this matter fully and, therefore, strongly
encouraged them to continue their discussions and to explore alternatives for providing information relevant to
the purchasing of capacity that is operationally feasible to provide at reasonable cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments on the NOPR essentially parallel the previous positions: proponents state the information is needed
to make business judgments and is information that would be available in a free market;
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 opponents contend it would undermine capacity release, is too costly to provide, would not be provided in a free market,
and unfairly requires shippers to divulge competitive information that would be used against them.
<FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>
 NGSA and Destec Energy comment that the Commission must be prepared to judge the merits of disputes, like this one,
which are based on competing economic interests. FMA asserts that for unresolved disputes, special consideration

The Commission finds that the Working Groups should continue to examine and explore means of reaching a compromise
on this issue. The Commission does not agree that the views of any one group should predominate over others. The parties
should seek to accommodate each other's interests, as they have on other issues, a process more likely to produce a
resolution preferable to both sides than if the Commission decides. Should agreement on whether to provide the information
prove elusive, the parties should, at a minimum, seek to agree upon a cost effective method of providing the information
if the Commission determines it is necessary.

B. Communication Protocols for Uploading Files and Downloading Subsets of Files 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NOPR, the Commission stated that development of standards permitting users to transmit (upload) files to the
pipelines' computers as well as to download subsets of files could increase the efficiency of the capacity allocation
mechanism. File upload capability, for example, would permit bidders to submit their bids electronically without
having to sign-on to the pipelines' on-line EBBs. The ability to download a subset of a capacity release file, such
as release information received after a certain date, would permit users to eliminate unneeded information from
the files they download and also increase the efficiency of the communication process. The Commission endorsed Working
Group 4's plan to continue its efforts to develop these capabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters support file uploading to provide efficient communication.
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 Others, principally pipelines, raise questions about file uploading. They contend file uploading is not as well
suited as on-line EBBs to handling bids submitted near the close of bidding periods, because, unlike EBBs, uploading
is not an interactive system permitting immediate notification to bidders of errors in their bids.

Edison states downloading of file subsets should be a priority. Columbia Gas maintains downloads of subsets based

downloads would be too expensive. UDC suggests the Commission should not mandate file uploading or downloading of
file subsets, but should trust the market to develop these capabilities if they are needed.

The Commission is convinced that the development of effective file uploading and subset downloading capability
would markedly enhance communication efficiency related to capacity release. Working Group 4 should continue to
assign a high priority to developing standards in this area. The Commission recognizes the concerns with uploads
submitted close to the end of the bidding period, but is confident the Working Groups can develop the necessary standards
to deal with this issue.

C. Standardization of Non-Capacity Release Business Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The industry established Working Group 3 to consider the development of standards relating to business practices,
other than capacity release, resulting from the business changes fostered by pipeline restructuring under Order
No. 636. In its report, the Working Group did not propose any standards; it outlined the areas of highest priority and
its process for continuing to examine these issues. Several commenters support the continuation of these efforts,
maintaining standardization of these business data is critically important to the industry.
<FOOTCITE>61</FOOTCITE>
 Vesta contends the Commission should require the pipelines now to provide the 16 data items tentatively established
by Working Group 3 as being the most critical. Others oppose the continuation of Working Group 3's deliberations,
arguing standards in these areas are not required by Order No. 636 and the Commission should limit its promulgation
of standards to those essential for capacity release.

From over 66 items proposed for review, Working Group 3 found 33 to be of high priority, and of those 33, focused its initial
review on ten elements.
<FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>
 In the Commission's view, standardization of these ten, or most of them, would provide a good departure point for this
effort. The Commission realizes all facets of the industry may not have equal need for all these elements, but these
elements would appear to have wide enough coverage that the benefits from standardization will be widespread. Moreover,
once standards are in place, those who may not now perceive a need for standards, may come to realize the standards will
make their business more efficient, and even those who do not need the standards themselves, stand to benefit if other
segments of the industry become more efficient.
<FOOTCITE>65</FOOTCITE>
 The Working Group should propose an appropriate implementation schedule for the ten identified data elements. The
Working Group also should continue its efforts to identify which of the remaining 23 high priority data elements,
as well as any others, require standardization and propose a schedule for implementation of standards for these elements
as well.

D. Policy Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The minority reports and initial comments raised questions about three policy issues: the method of recovering the
costs of standardization, pipeline disclaimers of liability for EBB operation, and the disclosure of non-price
considerations underlying capacity release transactions. The Commission stated in the NOPR that such substantive
policy issues are beyond the scope of this proceeding and are more appropriately considered in individual proceedings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Costs of Standardization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NOPR, the Commission recognized the concern of firm shippers that the costs of compliance with the EBB standards
should be spread equitably across all those benefitting from the standards. The Commission encouraged the industry
to consider methods for ensuring equitable sharing of such costs, such as user or access fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters support development of a fair and equitable method of allocating costs.
<FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>
 Transco and Williston Basin maintain EDI, in particular, is not suitable for all customers and suggest the costs of
implementing this technology should be borne by those benefitting from it. PSCW contends LDCs should not have to subsidize
the costs of providing information benefitting other parties and suggests an incremental pricing system for all
information beyond a basic level. A number of commenters are concerned about leaving the issue solely to rate cases.
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 They maintain the policy needs to be consistent across pipelines and urge the Commission to decide on the method for
allocating costs in this proceeding or in another generic proceeding, leaving implementation to individual rate
cases. Power Generators opposes inclusion of this issue in the Working Groups, because the success of the Groups was
due to their focus on technical issues.

INGAA suggests direct charges may be appropriate for additional services and features that go beyond the standards
to be adopted by the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Commission finds that its previous policy of permitting the pipelines to recover fixed costs through
a reservation charge and only variable costs through a usage charge is appropriate for the basic EBB service. This
basic service includes, at a minimum, the downloadable data sets and communication protocols established in this
rule, which the Commission finds are necessary to promote a viable capacity release market and should provide generalized
system-wide benefits to all users of the pipeline grid. Until additional standards are presented, the Commission
cannot determine whether they provide sufficient benefits to the industry as a whole to warrant inclusion in the basic
EBB package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For enhancements to the basic EBB service, which are not of general benefit, the Commission is open to considering
cost recovery approaches that will recover fixed costs from the limited number of users deriving benefit from the
service. The Commission encourages the industry to pursue such approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an example, pipelines could consider using a process for recovering the costs of enhancements to the standard EBB
package from only those customers that subscribe to the enhancements. The pipeline could explore with the users of
its EBB the costs of providing a particular service or group of services and methods of recovering these costs from
the subscribing users, such as through access fees, reservation charges, or direct charges. The pipeline and the
users also could establish mechanisms for reimbursing the initial subscribers if additional users later evince
an interest in obtaining the services. Once having obtained agreement from those customers desiring the service,
the pipeline could make a tariff filing to establish the method of recovery or submit an application or petition for
a declaratory order requesting advance Commission review of the proposed costs and charges.

Several commenters suggest the liability standard for EBB operations should be the same across all pipelines and,
therefore, should be resolved either in this proceeding or in another generic proceeding.

supports consideration of the issue in individual proceedings, but suggests the Commission restate here its standard
that pipeline liability for EBB operations should be no different than for other operations. UDC asks the Commission
to state that it will enforce its standard. Some parties contend the Commission should adopt a new standard, arguing
EBBs are not like other pipeline operations since parties other than the pipeline are responsible for providing information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
71
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because verification of such information is time consuming, they recommend each party ensure the accuracy of the
information it provides. Con Edison, in contrast, argues that pipeline tariff provisions regarding EBB user indemnification
of the pipeline are too onerous and hold the EBB user to a higher standard of responsibility than applies to the pipeline.
Enron contends the issue is beyond the scope of this proceeding.

The Commission agrees that this issue goes beyond the technical concerns with standards development which were the
focus of this proceeding. The Commission can determine policy related issues in individual cases without having
to establish a new generic proceeding and already has addressed this issue in restructuring orders. The Commission
has adopted the principle that a pipeline's liability for EBB operations should be the same as for its other operations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

3. Non-Price Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
O&amp;R contends standards are needed to guard against capacity releases involving deals for indirect consideration,
such as capacity release transactions tied to gas supply arrangements. It asserts this issue is not better addressed
in individual proceedings, but requires a definitive policy statement. The Commission adheres to its conclusion
that this issue is outside the scope of this technical rulemaking and should not be an issue considered by the continuing
Working Group sessions. The Commission has addressed this concern in individual restructuring proceedings based
on the facts and circumstances in each case.

Commission need not articulate its policy through a generic proceeding, but can do so in individual proceedings.

E. Gas Industry Standards Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several of the Working Group reports, and initial comments, endorsed the development of a Gas Industry Standards
Board (GISB) which ultimately would replace the Working Groups and continue the development and maintenance of industry-wide
standards. In the NOPR, the Commission stated it was interested in this concept and invited submission of a proposal
as to how it would operate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters support an industry standards board in concept as long as all industry segments are represented,
but noted the concept is still in the planning phase so any detailed comments would be premature.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
75
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of commenters emphasized that the GISB concept should not interfere with the on-going efforts of the Working
Groups. El Paso did not support an industry standards board unless it was limited to communication format standards,
and O&amp;R contended such a board should be an advisory panel only. Con Edison, in contrast, contends the scope of
the board should be extended beyond electronic communication to include standardization relating to pipeline operations,
imbalances, and nominations.

On November 2, 1993, the Commission met with representatives from the Natural Gas Council to hear a report on the progress
of GISB. The Commission remains interested in this concept and looks forward to a detailed proposal. When the Commission
receives a proposal, it will give close consideration to the effects of such an independent industry standardization
effort on all facets of the gas industry, Commission regulation, and state regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the meantime, the Working Group efforts should continue apace. The Working Groups should not defer or delay the
development of standards in anticipation of the formation of a standards board. Moreover, they should ensure their
proposals can stand alone and should not rely upon the eventual existence of a standards board as the means to administer
the standards.

VIII. Environmental Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is required to prepare an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement for any action
that may have a significant adverse effect on the human environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
76
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from these requirements as not having a significant effect
on the human environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
77
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The action taken here falls within the categorical exclusions in the Commission's regulations for rules that are
clarifying or procedural and that relate to information gathering, analysis, and dissemination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
78
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, an environmental assessment is unnecessary and has not been prepared in this rulemaking.

The required information under FERC&hyph;549(A) enables the Commission to carry out its legislative mandate under
the NGA and NGPA and will ensure a viable capacity release market under Commission Order No. 636. Specifically, the
required information allows the Commission to review/monitor capacity release transactions and firm and interruptible
capacity made available directly from pipelines and to take appropriate action, where and when necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is submitting notification of these information/EBB requirements to OMB for its review and approval.
Interested persons may send comments regarding the burden estimates or any other aspect of these EBB standards/information
requirements, including suggestions for reducing the estimated burden, by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services
Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415]. Comments on the requirements of the subject final rule may also be sent to the Office

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its public information regulations to reflect changes already
adopted by the agency as a result of the 1986 amendments to the Freedom of Information Act (the FOIA), executive branch
directives, and judicial standards governing disclosure of agency records under the FOIA. In practice, FDA modified
its policies and procedures to comply with these changes as they became effective. The regulations are being updated
to reflect these changes. The agency is also adding clarifying language to certain of its public information regulations
and making technical changes necessary to update citations and cross-references.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's practice and policy under the FOIA have undergone a number of changes as a result of legislation, executive directives,
and judicial precedents over the past years. FDA modified and updated its practices and policies to comply with these
changes as they became effective. FDA is now formally amending its public information regulations to reflect changes
that were required by law and which have already been put into effect. Specifically, FDA is updating its public information
regulations to reflect provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508), the Freedom
of Information Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;570), Executive Order 12600 (June 23, 1987) establishing predisclosure
notification procedures, guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) (52 FR 10012 at 10018,
March 27, 1987), the revised Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulations at 45 CFR part 5, and the widely
adopted District of Columbia (D.C.) Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in

FDA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 704 F.2d 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The agency is also adding language to &sect;&sect;20.53 and 20.85 (21 CFR 20.53 and
20.83) in order to clarify particular aspects of those regulations that have been the subject of some confusion. In
addition, FDA is making technical revisions to certain public information regulations to update citations to cross-references
that have changed since the last revision of part 20 (21 CFR part 20).

II. Procedural Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Investigatory Records Compiled for Law Enforcement Purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language of &sect;20.64, regarding records compiled for law enforcement purposes, is being changed to conform
to the 1986 amendments to the FOIA, which broadened the FOIA exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7) that protects certain law enforcement records from mandatory public disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Disclosure to Congress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 20.87 is being revised to reflect the provision of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 that removed
the statutory barrier that previously prohibited FDA from disclosing certain trade secret information to Congress,
(Pub. L. 101&hyph;508). Section 4755(c)(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended section 301(j)
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 331(j)) in order to permit FDA to disclose to Congress
certain trade secret information that is otherwise prohibited from disclosure except to employees of DHHS or to the
courts in relevant judicial proceedings. Such disclosures to Congress may only be pursuant to a request from the Senate,
the House of Representatives, any committee or subcommittee with jurisdiction over the matter being investigated,
or any joint committee of Congress or any subcommittee of such joint committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Trade Secret and Confidential Commercial Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12600, issued June 23, 1987, requires Federal agencies to establish predisclosure notification
procedures in certain circumstances before releasing commercial information submitted by businesses. FDA has
complied with the terms of the Executive Order since it became effective, and has followed the procedures adopted
by DHHS in the regulations published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 25, 1988 (53 FR 47697). To clarify these practices and for the convenience of the public, FDA is incorporating
DHHS' regulations concerning predisclosure notification into FDA's regulations governing the disclosure of trade
secret and confidential commercial information at &sect;20.61. Accordingly, the standards and procedures promulgated
by DHHS at 45 CFR 5.65(c), (d), and (e) are being added to FDA's public information regulations in &sect;20.61(d),
(e), and (f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 20.61 also is being amended to reflect the narrow definition of ``trade secret'' that was adopted by the D.C.
Circuit Court of Appeals in

FDA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 704 F.2d 1280, 1288 (D.C. Cir. 1983). That definition requires a direct relationship between the information being
protected and the productive process. The definition adopted by the D.C. Circuit in that case has become the most widely
adopted judicial test for defining trade secret information under the FOIA and is already codified in the DHHS FOIA
regulations at 45 CFR 5.65(a). This amendment to &sect;20.61 will not affect agency practice because FDA has distinguished
between trade secret and confidential commercial information in accordance with the definition in the

D. Fees and Fee Waivers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 20.42 and 20.43 are being amended to reflect changes required by the 1986 amendments to the FOIA concerning
fees and fee waivers and the OMB guidelines promulgated to implement those changes. FDA is adopting the standards
and procedures promulgated by DHHS at 45 CFR 5.41 through 5.45, except that 45 CFR 5.42(g) is excluded from &sect;20.42
because 45 CFR 5.42(g) pertains only to the Social Security Administration. In general, the regulations being adopted
codify the descriptions of categories of requesters, the new fee structure and fee limitations, and the revised standards
for fee waivers or reductions established by the 1986 amendments to the FOIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 20.41 is being amended to remove the paragraphs that refer to $25 as the amount that triggers a requirement
for prepayment of FOIA fees. The guidelines promulgated by OMB and the DHHS regulations include an advance payment
provision for fees that exceed $250. That requirement is being included in revised &sect;20.42. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Clarifications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Indexing Trade Secrets and Confidential Commercial or Financial Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A recent report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) criticized FDA's regulation concerning &sect;20.53 Indexing
trade secrets and confidential or financial information. GAO believed that it would be an abrogation of the agency's
responsibilities to disclose information in those circumstances when a submitter failed to intervene to defend
against the release of its records. The report hypothesized circumstances in which a firm could suffer severe financial
loss because it could not afford legal representation to defend the competitive value of its commercial information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the regulation has been in effect for almost two decades, such a situation has never materialized. The agency
continues to believe that the burden of defending business related records should be borne by the owner and submitter
of such information, who is in the best position to explain the competitive harm that may result from disclosure. A
company's unwillingness to take steps to protect the information it has submitted to the agency and to index the records
at issue is ordinarily evidence to FDA that disclosure of the information is not likely to cause the submitter substantial
competitive harm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the agency has never and would not at any time abandon its responsibilities to protect information that is
truly prohibited from release. Although the situation has never previously arisen, there may be exceptional circumstances
that would make it unreasonable for FDA to expect a submitter to participate as an intervenor in defending the proprietary
value of its records. Accordingly, the language of the regulation is being amended to clarify that a company's failure
to intervene to defend the exempt status of its information and to itemize and index the disputed records is not treated
as an automatic waiver of the submitter's interest in protection of the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Disclosure to Other Federal Agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 1991 contract report ``FDA Safeguards Against Improper Disclosure of Financially Sensitive Information,'' which
was undertaken as part of the FDA Commissioner's integrity initiative, recommended that FDA obtain written pledges
of confidentiality when it provides nonpublic information to other Federal agencies, such as the Securities Exchange
Commission (SEC), as part of cooperative law enforcement efforts. FDA's regulations governing the disclosure of
information to other Federal agencies, &sect;20.85, is intended to require written commitments of confidentiality,
and staff manual guides and internal agency guidance have consistently instructed personnel to obtain such written
commitments. However, because the 1991 report named above suggested some confusion among FDA and other Department
and Federal employees, FDA is adding the word ``written'' to &sect;20.85 so that the regulation clearly states that
such disclosures can only be made pursuant to a ``written'' agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Technical Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 20.100 is being revised to update cross-references that have changed because agency regulations have been
amended or new regulations have been promulgated since the last revision of part 20. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the agency's current practice with respect to disclosure of records will not change as a result of any of these
amendments, and because the amendments set forth in section I. of this document are required either by statute, executive
branch directives, or judicial decisions, FDA finds for good cause under &sect;10.40(e) that notice and public procedure
are unnecessary (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) and (d)). However, under &sect;10.40(e), FDA is providing an opportunity
for comment to determine whether the regulations should subsequently be modified or revoked.

have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental

FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Executive
Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation
is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental,
public health and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity). The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354)
requires analyzing options for regulatory relief for small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule amends the regulations for FDA's practice and policy under the FOIA. Because the amendments merely update
the regulations to reflect procedural changes already adopted by the agency as a result of legislation, executive
branch directives, or legal precedents, no additional impact is anticipated. Accordingly, FDA finds that this final
rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866. In compliance with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small businesses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;20.42 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Fees to be charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Categories of requests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section state, for each category of request, the type of fees that the Food and
Drug Administration will generally charge. However, for each of these categories, the fees may be limited, waived,
or reduced for the reasons given in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and in &sect;20.43 or for other reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Commercial use request. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the request is for a commercial use, the Food and Drug Administration will charge for the costs of search, review,
and duplication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Educational and scientific institutions and news media. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the request is from an educational institution or a noncommercial scientific institution, operated primarily
for scholarly or scientific research, or a representative of the news media, and the request is not for a commercial
use, the Food and Drug Administration will charge only for the duplication of documents. Also, the Food and Drug Administration
will not charge the copying costs for the first 100 pages of duplication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other requests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the request is not the kind described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, then the Food and Drug Administration
will charge only for the search and the duplication. Also, the Food and Drug Administration will not charge for the
first 2 hours of search time or for the copying costs of the first 100 pages of duplication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General provisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Food and Drug Administration may charge search fees even if the records found are exempt from disclosure or
if no records are found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If, under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, there is no charge for the first 2 hours of search time, and those 2 hours
are spent on a computer search, then the 2 free hours are the first 2 hours of the operator's own operation. If the operator
spends less than 2 hours on the search, the total search fees will be reduced by the average hourly rate for the operator's
time, multiplied by 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If, under paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, there is no charge for the first 100 pages of duplication,
then those 100 pages are the first 100 pages of photocopies of standard size pages, or the first 100 pages of computer
printout. If this method to calculate the fee reduction cannot be used, then the total duplication fee will be reduced
by the normal charge for photocopying a standard size page, multiplied by 100. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) No charge will be made if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the
amount of the fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If it is determined that a requester (acting either alone or together with others) is breaking down a single request
into a series of requests in order to avoid (or reduce) the fees charged, all these requests may be aggregated for purposes
of calculating the fees charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Interest will be charged on unpaid bills beginning on the 31st day following the day the bill was sent. Provisions
in 45 CFR part 30, the Department of Health and Human Services regulations governing claims collection, will be used
in assessing interest, administrative costs, and penalties, and in taking actions to encourage payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fee schedule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration charges the following fees: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Manual searching for or reviewing of records. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the search or review is performed by employees at grade GS&hyph;1 through GS&hyph;8, an hourly rate based on the
salary of a GS&hyph;5, step 7, employee; when done by a GS&hyph;9 through GS&hyph;14, an hourly rate based on the salary
of a GS&hyph;12, step 4, employee; and when done by a GS&hyph;15 or above, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS&hyph;15,
step 7, employee. In each case, the hourly rate will be computed by taking the current hourly rate for the specified
grade and step, adding 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits, and rounding to the nearest whole dollar. As of January
1, 1993, these rates were $12, $24, and $43 respectively. When a search involves employees at more than one of these
levels, the Food and Drug Administration will charge the rate appropriate for each. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Agreement to pay. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration generally assumes that a requester is willing to pay the fees charged for services
associated with the request. The requester may specify a limit on the amount to be spent. If it appears that the fees
will exceed the limit, the Food and Drug Administration will consult the requester to determine whether to proceed
with the search. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Advance payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a requester has failed to pay previous bills in a timely fashion, or if the Food and Drug Administration's initial
review of the request indicates that the charges will exceed $250, the requester will be required to pay past due fees
and/or the estimated fees, or a deposit, before the search for the requested records begins. In such cases, the requester
will be notified promptly upon receipt of the request, and the administrative time limits prescribed in &sect;20.41
will begin only after there is an agreement with the requester over payment of fees, or a decision that fee waiver or
reduction is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Billing and payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ordinarily, the requester will be required to pay all fees before the Food and Drug Administration will furnish the
records. At its discretion, the Food and Drug Administration may send the requester a bill along with or following
the records. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may do this if the requester has a history of prompt payment.
The Food and Drug Administration may also, at its discretion, aggregate the charges for certain time periods in order
to avoid sending numerous small bills to frequent requesters, or to businesses or agents representing requesters.
For example, the Food and Drug Administration might send a bill to such a requester once a month. Fees should be paid
in accordance with the instructions furnished by the person who responds to the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;20.43 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs will waive or reduce the fees that would otherwise be charged if disclosure
of the information meets both of the following tests: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations
or activities of the Government; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. These two tests are explained in paragraphs (b)
and (c) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public interest.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Disclosure of information satisfies the first test only if it furthers the specific public interest of being likely
to contribute significantly to public understanding of Government operations or activities, regardless of any
other public interest it may further. In analyzing this question, the Food and Drug Administration will consider
the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether the records to be disclosed pertain to the operations or activities of the Federal Government; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether disclosure of the records would reveal any meaningful information about Government operations or activities
that is not already public knowledge; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether disclosure will advance the understanding of the general public as distinguished from a narrow segment
of interested persons. Under this factor, the Food and Drug Administration may consider whether the requester is
in a position to contribute to public understanding. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may consider whether
the requester has such knowledge or expertise as may be necessary to understand the information, and whether the requester's
intended use of the information would be likely to disseminate the information to the public. An unsupported claim
to be doing research for a book or article does not demonstrate that likelihood, while such a claim by a representative
of the news media is better evidence; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding will be a significant one, i.e., will the public's understanding
of the Government's operations be substantially greater as a result of the disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Not primarily in the requester's commercial interest.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If disclosure passes the test of furthering the specific public interest described in paragraph (b) of this section,
the Food and Drug Administration will determine whether disclosure also furthers the requester's commercial interest
and, if so, whether this effect outweighs the advancement of that public interest. In applying this second test, the
Food and Drug Administration will consider the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether disclosure would further a commercial interest of the requester, or of someone on whose behalf the requester
is acting. Commercial interests include interests relating to business, trade, and profit. Both profit and nonprofit-making
corporations have commercial interests, as well as individuals, unions, and other associations. The interest of
a representative of the news media in using the information for news dissemination purposes will not be considered
a commercial interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If disclosure would further a commercial interest of the requester, whether that effect outweighs the advancement
of the public interest as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deciding between waiver and reduction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the disclosure of the information requested passes both tests described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section,
the Food and Drug Administration will normally waive fees. However, in some cases the Food and Drug Administration
may decide only to reduce the fees. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may do this when disclosure of some
but not all of the requested records passes the tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedure for requesting a waiver or reduction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A requester must request a waiver or reduction of fees at the same time as the request for records. The requester should
explain why a waiver or reduction is proper under the factors set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
Only the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs may make the decision whether to waive or reduce the fees. If the
Food and Drug Administration does not completely grant the request for a waiver or reduction, the denial letter will
designate a review official. The requester may appeal the denial to that official. The appeal letter should address
reasons for the Associate Commissioner's decision that are set forth in the denial letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

*&blank;*&blank;* If the affected person fails to intervene to defend the exempt status of the records and to itemize

whether that person has waived such exemption so as to require the Food and Drug Administration to promptly make the
records available for public disclosure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;20.61

which is privileged or confidential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A trade secret may consist of any commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making,
preparing, compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product of either innovation
or substantial effort. There must be a direct relationship between the trade secret and the productive process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) A person who submits records to the Government may designate part or all of the information in such records as exempt
from disclosure under exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act. The person may make this designation either at
the time the records are submitted to the Government or within a reasonable time thereafter. The designation must
be in writing. Where a legend is required by a request for proposals or request for quotations, pursuant to 48 CFR 352.215&hyph;12,
then that legend is necessary for this purpose. Any such designation will expire 10 years after the records were submitted
to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The procedures in this paragraph apply to records on which the submitter has designated information as provided
in paragraph (d) of this section. These procedures also apply to records that were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration
when the agency has substantial reason to believe that information in the records could reasonably be considered
exempt under exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act. Certain exceptions to these procedures are set forth in
paragraph (f) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When the Food and Drug Administration receives a request for such records and determines that disclosure may be
required, the Food and Drug Administration will make reasonable efforts to notify the submitter about these facts.
The notice will include a copy of the request, and it will inform the submitter about the procedures and time limits
for submission and consideration of objections to disclosure. If the Food and Drug Administration must notify a large
number of submitters, notification may be done by posting or publishing a notice in a place where the submitters are
reasonably likely to become aware of it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The submitter has 5 working days from receipt of the notice to object to disclosure of any part of the records and
to state all bases for its objections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(3) The Food and Drug Administration will give consideration to all bases that have been stated in a timely manner by
the submitter. If the Food and Drug Administration decides to disclose the records, the Food and Drug Administration
will notify the submitter in writing. This notice will briefly explain why the agency did not sustain the submitter's
objections. The Food and Drug Administration will include with the notice a copy of the records about which the submitter
objected, as the agency proposes to disclose them. The notice will state that the Food and Drug Administration intends
to disclose the records 5 working days after the submitter receives the notice unless a U.S. District Court orders
the agency not to release them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If a requester files suit under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain records covered by this paragraph, the
Food and Drug Administration will promptly notify the submitter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Whenever the Food and Drug Administration sends a notice to a submitter under paragraph (e)(1) of this section,
the Food and Drug Administration will notify the requester that the Food and Drug Administration is giving the submitter
a notice and an opportunity to object. Whenever the Food and Drug Administration sends a notice to a submitter under
paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the Food and Drug Administration will notify the requester of this fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The notice requirements in paragraph (e) of this section do not apply in the following situations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Food and Drug Administration decided not to disclose the records; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The information has previously been published or made generally available; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Disclosure is required by a regulation issued after notice and opportunity for public comment, that specifies
narrow categories of records that are to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, but in this case a submitter
may still designate records as described in paragraph (d) of this section, and in exceptional cases, the Food and Drug
Administration may, at its discretion, follow the notice procedures in paragraph (e) of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The information requested has not been designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure when the submitter
had an opportunity to do so at the time of submission of the information or within a reasonable time thereafter, unless
the Food and Drug Administration has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result
in competitive harm; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The designation appears to be obviously frivolous, but in this case the Food and Drug Administration will still
give the submitter the written notice required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section (although this notice need not
explain our decision or include a copy of the records), and the Food and Drug Administration will notify the requester
as described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.

(1) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) Would deprive a person to a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign
agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis; and information
furnished by a confidential source in the case of a record compiled by the Food and Drug Administration or any other
criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national
security intelligence investigation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions or would disclose
guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, if such disclosure could reasonably be expected
to risk circumvention of the law; or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is revoking a regulation that implements section 403(d) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) by defining the circumstances in which a food is misbranded, and that became final
by operation of law on May 10, 1993. In addition, the agency is replacing this revoked regulation with one that was included
in a final rule that published in the

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535) became law on November
8, 1990. Section 6 of the 1990 amendments established a procedure under which FDA was given 30 months from the date of
their enactment to promulgate final rules implementing that section. Pursuant to that procedure, FDA published
a proposal on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2957) (the misleading container proposal), to amend its regulations by implementing
new &sect;100.100 (21 CFR 100.100) to define the circumstances in which a food is misbranded under section 403(d)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(b)(3)(D)(ii) of the 1990 amendments provides that, if the final rule to implement section 403(d) of the
act is not promulgated within 30 months of the date of passage of the 1990 amendments (November 8, 1990), then the regulation
proposed to implement that section is to be considered a final regulation. Further, section 6 provides that States
and their political subdivisions shall be preempted with respect to section 403(d) of the act at that time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 30-month period established by the 1990 amendments expired on May 9, 1993. Because FDA was unable to publish a final
rule, in the proceeding instituted in January 1993, by May 9, 1993, FDA published a document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 12, 1993 (58 FR 27932) (the May 12, 1993, regulation), announcing that the regulation that FDA had proposed in
the misleading container proposal was considered to be a final regulation by operation of law, effective May 10, 1993.
This document did not conclude the rulemaking begun in January, 1993, however. Rather, the May 12, 1993, regulation
was part of a separate proceeding that is compelled under section 6(b)(3)(D)(ii) of the 1990 amendments (see H. Rept.
101&hyph;538, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 18 and 136 Congressional Record 5842 on the effect of this ``hammer'' provision).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64123), FDA published a final rule on the circumstances in which containers are misleading
and thus would misbrand the food under section 403(d) of the act. This final rule concluded the proceeding that the
agency instituted with the misleading container proposal. In the May 12, 1993, document, FDA stated that when it issued
such a final rule, it would act to supersede the regulation that had become final by operation of law. Thus, the agency
proposed to withdraw the May 10, 1993, regulation in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64208).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA explained that it was proposing to do so for two reasons. First, the May 10, 1993, regulation did not have the benefit
of public comment. Thus, the regulation included in the December 6, 1993, final rule (the December 6, 1993 regulation),
which was the product of notice and comment rulemaking, is better able than the May 10, 1993, regulation to ensure adequate
implementation of section 403(d) of the act and to facilitate compliance. Second, FDA tentatively found that because
of the minor differences between the May 10, 1993, regulation and the December 6, 1993, regulation, replacing the
former with the latter will not result in any hardship to manufacturers who have relied on the May 10, 1993, regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA gave interested persons 10 days to comment on its proposal to withdraw the May 10, 1993, regulation. It also proposed
to make any final rule that issues in this proceeding effective on the date of its publication in order to ensure that
the supersession of the May 10, 1993, regulation proceeded as expeditiously as possible and with a minimum of confusion
or ambiguity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on the proposal to withdraw the May 10, 1993, regulation closed on December 17, 1993. FDA received
no comments on this proposed action. Therefore, FDA advises that the May 10, 1993, regulation, which became final
by operation of law, is withdrawn. FDA advises that it is replacing that regulation with the December 6, 1993, regulation.

Environmental Impact

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the December 6, 1993, proposal (58 FR 64208 at 64209), FDA stated that it had determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(ii)
that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment,
and that as a result, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. FDA
received no comments on the conclusion; therefore FDA restates it here.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the December 6, 1993, proposal (58 FR 64208 at 64209), FDA incorporated the conclusion from the December 6, 1993,
final rule on slack-fill that the agency's action in replacing the May 10, 1993, regulation would not have any significant
economic effects. The agency received no comments on this conclusion and consequently is restating it here.

Misleading containers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 403(d) of the act, a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its container is so made, formed,
or filled as to be misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A container that does not allow the consumer to fully view its contents shall be considered to be filled as to be misleading
if it contains nonfunctional slack-fill. Slack-fill is the difference between the actual capacity of a container
and the volume of product contained therein. Nonfunctional slack-fill is the empty space in a package that is filled
to less than its capacity for reasons other than:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Protection of the contents of the package;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The requirements of the machines used for enclosing the contents in such package;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Unavoidable product settling during shipping and handling;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The need for the package to perform a specific function (e.g., where packaging plays a role in the preparation or
consumption of a food), where such function is inherent to the nature of the food and is clearly communicated to consumers;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The fact that the product consists of a food packaged in a reusable container where the container is part of the presentation
of the food and has value which is both significant in proportion to the value of the product and independent of its function
to hold the food, e.g., a gift product consisting of a food or foods combined with a container that is intended for further
use after the food is consumed; or durable commemorative or promotional packages; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Inability to increase level of fill or to further reduce the size of the package (e.g., where some minimum package
size is necessary to accommodate required food labeling (excluding any vignettes or other nonmandatory designs
or label information), discourage pilfering, facilitate handling, or accommodate tamper-resistant devices).

The establishment of viticultural areas and the subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of viticultural area names as appellations of origin in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wine labeling and advertising will help consumers better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify the wines they may purchase, and will help

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF&hyph;53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27 CFR part 4. These regulations allow the establishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of definite American viticultural areas. The regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also allow the name of an approved viticultural area to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used as an appellation of origin in the labeling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advertising of wine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF&hyph;60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing for the listing of American viticultural areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4.25a(e)(l), title 27, CFR, defines an American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguishable by geographical features, the boundaries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which have been delineated in subpart C of part 9. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for proposing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American viticultural area. Any interested person may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area. The petition should include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area specified in the petition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the viticultural area are as specified in the petition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Evidence relating to the geographical characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from surrounding areas; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A description of the specific boundaries of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area, based on features which can be found on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largest applicable scale; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Wisconsin, to establish a viticultural area in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
south-central Wisconsin to be known as ``Lake Wisconsin.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The viticultural area is bounded by the shoreline of Lake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wisconsin and the Wisconsin River on the north and west. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wollersheim Winery is the sole winery located in the 28,000

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to Mr. Wollersheim's petition, ATF published a notice of proposed rulemaking, Notice No. 781, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49949), proposing the establishment of the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area. The notice
requested comments from all interested persons by October 25, 1993.

Comments to Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seven comments were received concerning the proposal to establish the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area. All seven
commenters stated that they fully support the proposed area as delineated in Notice No. 781. One of the commenters
was under the mistaken impression that this area had been proposed to be called the Roxbury Viticultural District.
However, despite the misunderstanding about the name, this commenter stated in his letter that he heartily supports
the establishment of a new viticultural area in this part of Wisconsin which includes the Wollersheim Winery.

Viticultural Area Name 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The place-name ``Lake Wisconsin'' was first used ca. 1917 to describe a widened section of the Wisconsin River that
was submerged when the Baraboo hydroelectric dam was constructed one mile upriver from the town of Prairie-du-Sac.
A travel brochure and map produced by the Lake Wisconsin Chamber of Commerce in 1989, entitled Lake Wisconsin Chamber
Recreation Area Vacationland, shows various recreational and tourist facilities in the Lake Wisconsin viticultural
area. The viticultural area has a long history of wine grape growing and wine making activity. Agoston Haraszthy,
an immigrant from Hungary well known as an early pioneer in the American wine industry, first planted wine grapes on
Wollersheim Winery property in 1847. Cold winter temperatures frustrated this early attempt to establish grapevines
and two years later Haraszthy moved to California. However, wine grape growing and wine making continued in this area
until 1900. Because of its role in the early history of Wisconsin, Wollersheim Winery and the adjacent homestead were
listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

Evidence of Boundaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The boundaries of the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area are clearly shown on two U.S.G.S. quadrangle maps, Sauk City,
Wisc. and Lodi, Wisc. The Sauk City, Wisc. quadrangle map shows the viticultural area to be bounded by the shoreline
of Lake Wisconsin and the Wisconsin River on the north and west. The southern boundary is defined by Mack Road and State
Highway Y, and the eastern boundary, shown on the Lodi, Wisc. quadrangle map, follows State Highway Y, State Highway
60, State Highway 113, and Spring Creek. The petitioner states that some of the natural boundary features, which closely
approximate some of the roads and highways used as boundaries for this viticultural area, can be found on county maps,
plat maps and county atlases dating back to 1861.

Geographical Features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Wisconsin River (of which Lake Wisconsin is a part) is a major natural feature of the State and of the region. It is
the largest river in the State after the Mississippi River, of which it is a major tributary. Roads and highways define
the southern boundary of the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area. The landscape of the viticultural area is comprised
of discontinuous end moraines interspersed with ground moraines and occasional outwash plains. The landscape outside
the southern boundary is of higher elevation and is comprised of rolling, hummocky upland with some outwash material.
The eastern boundary, which closely approximates Spring Creek, identifies an area of low relief, continuous and
intermittent stream drainage, and marsh. To the east of Spring Creek and outside the viticultural area is a glaciated
upland plain where the landscape is generally of higher elevations and comprised of end moraines with little or no
outwash material.

Topography and Elevation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The vineyards in the viticultural area are located at an elevation of 800&hyph;900 feet along south and southwest
facing slopes of 10&hyph;40 percent gradient. This combination of elevation, aspect, and relief contributes to
the well-drained quality of the vineyard soils, the free circulation of air in summer and winter, and the locally longer
growing season. Outside the viticultural area to the north and west, higher elevations of 900&hyph;1,200 feet increase
the risk of wind damage to grapevines, or the soils become too shallow for successful grape cultivation where bedrock
is nearer the surface or exposed. Outside the viticultural area to the east, elevations between 720 feet (Wisconsin
River level) and 800 feet are generally less well drained or are saturated during periods of rainfall or snowmelt.

Climate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Lake Wisconsin viticultural area benefits from the microclimate effects of the lower Wisconsin River valley.
The river moderates winter temperatures in the viticultural area several degrees higher than areas north and west
of the river or further south. Air circulation within the river valley helps prevent cold air accumulation and frost
pockets from forming in the vineyards. In summer, the river valley and limestone bluffs along the river's edge serve
to channel air currents and increase localized air circulation, protecting the vineyards from mildew and rot in hot,
humid weather. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The viticultural area has a mean precipitation of twenty-nine inches, one inch less than the average rainfall in the
area north and east, three inches less than the average rainfall in the area to the west, and two inches less than the
State average. The petitioner describes the viticultural area as an ``island'' of locally below-average rainfall
and drier soils conducive to the grapevines concentrating their vigor in ripening fruit. The viticultural area has
a growing season of 140&hyph;160 days, ten to twenty days longer than across the river to the west and to the north. The
additional frost-free period allows the grapes to reach maturity before the onset of winter cold.

Soil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Wisconsin River forms an approximate dividing line between the glaciated and unglaciated regions of south-central
Wisconsin. Soils primarily of glacial till and outwash material are found east of the river valley and characterize
the soils in the viticultural area. The unglaciated ``driftless'' soils west of the valley result from significant
differences in soil parent materials, microrelief, and drainage. The soils that support viticulture within the
viticultural area are Typic Hapludalfs of mixed mineral material and silty or loamy texture. All are underlain by
gravelly or sandy loam glacial till or by dolomitic bedrock. The soils are typically well drained and about 36&hyph;60
inches deep on slopes and rolling areas of 2&hyph;45 percent gradient. The soils outside the viticultural area to
the north and west are predominately unglaciated, and so are not underlain by glacial till and contain less outwash
material. The soils outside the area to the south and east, although glacially derived, are found on topography of
rolling upland with fewer limestone outcrops and no outwash plains. The soils there have formed on slightly higher
elevations over discontinuous end and ground moraines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local
or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is hereby certified that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities. The establishment of a viticultural area is neither an endorsement nor approval by ATF of the quality
of wine produced in the area, but rather an identification of an area that is distinct from surrounding areas. This
process merely allows wineries to more accurately describe the origin of their wines to the consumers, and helps consumers
identify the wines they purchase. Designation of a viticultural area itself has no significant economic impact because
any commercial advantage can come only from consumer acceptance of wines made from grapes grown within the area. In
addition, no new recordkeeping or reporting requirements are imposed. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis
is not required.

The Lake Wisconsin viticultural area is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in Columbia and Dane Counties, Wisconsin. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundary is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The point of beginning is on the ``Lodi, Wisc.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.G.S. map in the northeast quarter-section of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17, Lodi Township, Columbia County, where Spring Creek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enters Lake Wisconsin; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) From the point of beginning, follow the southern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shoreline of Lake Wisconsin northwest to where Lake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wisconsin narrows and becomes the Wisconsin River on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
map, in the vicinity of the town of Merrimac, Sauk County; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Then continue along the southern shoreline of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wisconsin River, west and south past Goose Egg Hill, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia County, on the ``Sauk City, Wisc.'' quadrangle map, and then west to a southwest bend in the shoreline opposite

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wiegands Bay, Sauk County, where the Wisconsin River 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-half a mile; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Then in a northeasterly direction about 1,000 feet on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State Highway 188, to the intersection of Mack Road; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Then east on Mack Road to the intersection of State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Highway Y, about 3 miles; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Then follow State Highway Y in a generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
northeasterly direction onto the ``Lodi, Wisc.'' quadrangle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
map and continue in a northeasterly direction to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intersection with State Highway 60; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

By letter dated October 6, 1993 (Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;18), Arkansas submitted a proposed amendment
to its plan pursuant to SMCRA. Arkansas submitted the proposed amendment in response to a required program amendment
at 30 CFR 904.26(a) that was placed on the Arkansas plan when OSM approved Arkansas' March 31, 1993, plan amendment
(58 FR 38532, July 19, 1993; Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;17). Arkansas intended that this amendment be in
compliance with section 402 of SMCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arkansas proposed to amend Arkansas Code Annotated (ACA) 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) that provides criteria for
the determination of the eligibility of certain project sites for AML funding. Specifically, Arkansas proposed
to require at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) a finding that the surface coal mining operation occurred during the
period beginning on August 4, 1977, and ending on November 5, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the November 1, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 58313; Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;25) and in the same notice opened the public comment period and
provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the substantive adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment
period closed on December 1, 1993. No substantive comments were received. The public hearing, scheduled for November
26, 1993, was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After a thorough review pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 884.14 and 884.15, the Director finds,
as discussed below, that Arkansas' October 6, 1993, proposed plan amendment is in compliance with SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM required at 30 CFR 904.26(a) that Arkansas submit a revision to ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) to limit operations
eligible for AML funds because of insolvency of a surety company to those operations whose surety became insolvent
during the time frame provided by section 402(g)(4)(B)(ii) of SMCRA. Section 402(g)(4)(B)(ii) of SMCRA, as revised
by the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508), provided that the period of time during
which such an operation would be eligible for AML funds because of the insolvency of the surety company would begin
on August 4, 1977, and end on the date of enactment of the revision to SMCRA, which was November 5, 1990. Because Arkansas
revised ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) to specify a period of time beginning on August 4, 1977, and ending on November
5, 1990, ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) is no less stringent than section 402(g)(4)(B)(ii) of SMCRA, as revised
by the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Act of 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director approves ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) and removes the required amendment at 30 CFR 904.26(a).

1. Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing
was held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Agency Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 884.14(a)(2) and 884.15(a), the Director solicited comments from the heads of various other Federal
agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Arkansas plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated October 29, 1993, (Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;22), the U.S. Bureau of Mines responded that
it had no comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated October 29, 1993 (Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;23), the U.S. National Park Service (NPS)
responded that the proposed amendment would not impact NPS program responsibilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated November 8, 1993 (Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;24), the U.S. Bureau of Land Management responded
with a recommendation that Arkansas be required to revise ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(c) so that it would read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining which sites to reclaim pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Director shall follow the priorities
stated in paragraphs (1) and (2) of 15&hyph;58&hyph;402. The Director shall ensure that priority is given to those
sites which are in the immediate vicinity of a residential area or which have an adverse economic impact upon a community
[once coal mining sites and toxic mining material sites on federal or state surface tracts have been reclaimed].
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
BLM proposed the addition of the bracketed language and stated that its intent was to protect the public interest as
a whole, particularly in the Ouachita National Forest, prior to focusing in on individual communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Referenced ``paragraph (b) of this section'' in ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401, as revised by the amendment that is the
subject of this notice, allows the reclamation under Arkansas' plan of certain surface coal mining operations that
operated on or after August 7, 1977, and were abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Referenced ``paragraphs (1) and (2) of 15&hyph;58&hyph;402'' require that the expenditure of AML funds reflect
the priorities of (1) the protection of public health, safety, general welfare, and property from extreme danger
of adverse effects of coal mining practices and (2) the protection of public health, safety, and general welfare from
adverse effects of coal mining practices. These State provisions are substantively identical to sections 403(a)
(1) and (2) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(c) is substantively identical to section 402(g)(4)(C) of SMCRA. In addition, section
411 of SMCRA provides for the use of AML funds for lands affected by noncoal mining only after a State has certified that
all abandoned coal mines have been reclaimed. Arkansas has not yet made this certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM cannot, as requested by BLM, require that Arkansas give higher priority to the reclamation of coal mining sites
and toxic mining material sites on federal or state surface tracts because sections 403(a), 402(g)(4)(C), and 411
of SMCRA do not do so.

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above finding, the Director approves Arkansas' proposed plan amendment, as submitted on October 6, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 904, codifying decisions concerning the Arkansas plan, are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State plan amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their plans into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay.
Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State abandoned mine land reclamation plans
and revisions thereof since each such plan is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Decisions on
proposed State AML reclamation plans and revisions thereof submitted by a State are based on a determination of whether
the submittal meets the requirements of Title IV of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1231&hyph;1243) and the applicable Federal regulations
at 30 CFR parts 884 and 888.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since agency decisions on proposed State abandoned mine
land reclamation plans and revisions thereof are categorically excluded from compliance with the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332) by the Manual of the Department of the Interior (516 DM 6, appendix 8, paragraph 8.4B(29)).

5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon Federal regulations for which an economic analysis
was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial
number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA or
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions in the analyses for
the corresponding Federal regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 20, 1990, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 published the Environmental Protection Agency's (the Agency's) revision of the National Emission Standards for
Hazardous Air Pollutants for Asbestos (asbestos NESHAP), 40 CFR part 61, subpart M, 55 FR 48406. The asbestos NESHAP
applies to any facility as defined in 40 CFR 61.141. The Agency has learned that some of the regulated community have
questions concerning the analysis of samples which may contain multiple layers, any or all of which may be asbestos
containing materials (ACM) under the asbestos NESHAP. Because these questions are frequently asked, EPA is making
this clarification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This clarification does not supersede, alter, or in any way replace the existing asbestos NESHAP. This notice is intended
solely as guidance and does not represent an action subject to judicial review under the section 307(b) of the Clean
Air Act or section 704 of the Administrative Procedure Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Clarification of Multi-layered ACM System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Protection Agency has received many questions about analyzing multi-layered systems for asbestos
content to determine the applicability of the asbestos NESHAP. This clarification reiterates EPA's position for
analysis of multi-layered samples for applicability of the asbestos NESHAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, when a sample consists of two or more distinct layers or materials, each layer should be treated separately
and the results reported by layer (discrete stratum). Specific examples are given below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Plaster/Stucco Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If plaster and stucco wall or ceiling systems are layered, and the layers can be distinguished, then the layers must
be analyzed separately. Where a plaster or stucco wall system is constructed in layers, and the asbestos-containing
layer becomes a distinguishable but ``non-separable'' component of the wall system, the results of the analysis
of the individual layer(s) may include a small amount of the other layers when analyzed (e.g. a skim coat layer may contain
a small amount of the base coat layer in the analysis of the skim coat layer).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Add-on Materials
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All materials ``added'' to wallboard or other base materials (e.g., sprayed-on materials, paint, ceiling or wall
texture, etc.) must be analyzed separately, if possible. The results of the analysis of those individual layers of
``add-on'' material may not be averaged with the result of the analysis of wallboard for a composite result, but must
be analyzed and reported separately. Where a thin coating of one material is applied over another material and the
materials cannot be separated without compromising the layers, the analysis may include a small amount of the base
layer. If for example, a paint layer containing asbestos is spread over a wallboard layer, and the paint layer cannot
be separated from the wallboard, then a small amount of the wallboard layer may be included in the sample of the paint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If any of the ``add-on'' materials meet the definition of regulated asbestos-containing material (as defined in
40 CFR 61.141), and if at least 160 square feet of the material(s) are involved in demolition or renovation (whether
planned or unplanned during a calendar year), then the project would be subject to the asbestos NESHAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Joint Compound/Wallboard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When joint compound and/or tape is applied to wallboard it becomes an integral part of the wallboard and in effect becomes
one material forming a wall system. Therefore, where a demolition or renovation impacts such a wall system, a composite
analysis of the wall system (percent of asbestos in the joint compound, tape and wallboard) should be conducted. If
the analysis shows an asbestos content of greater than one percent and at least 160 square feet of the wall system is
involved in the demolition or renovation activities (whether planned or unplanned, during a calendar year), then
the activities would be subject to the asbestos NESHAP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. On May 11, 1993, final rules were adopted that established call sign administrators for club and military recreation
stations in the amateur service. Subsequently, a petition for reconsideration was filed in which it was argued that
the establishment of such administrators was not minor and non-controversial and that a notice and comment proceeding
should have been held before final rules were adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Further, the Commission is activating a new automated licensing system that will enable it to perform, with minimal
burden, the function that administrators in the private sector were going to perform without reimbursement. Also,
a new proposal by the Commission regarding call signs will meet the need of persons interested in obtaining a club station
license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Because there appears to be merit in the argument that the establishment of administrators is controversial, and
because the new proposal will meet the need of persons interested in the club station licenses, the rule provisions
that established private entity club call sign administrators can be vacated.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Chapter Ten of NAFTA requires the three NAFTA countries (the United States, Canada, and Mexico) to eliminate ``buy
national'' restrictions on non-defense related purchases, by their responsible Federal Governments, of goods
and services provided by firms in North America. NAFTA applies to most United States Government agencies. The Canadian
Free Trade Agreement is suspended while NAFTA remains in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by NAFTA, specified agencies must evaluate certain NAFTA country end products offers without regard
to the restrictions of the Buy American Act or the Balance of Payments Program. This evaluation method will apply to
offers of Canadian end products under supply contracts with an estimated value above $25,000 and Mexican end products
under supply contracts with an estimated value of $50,000 or more, except for the Department of Energy's Power Marketing
Administrations, where the estimated acquisition value is $250,000 or more. This evaluation method also will apply
to construction contracts with an estimated acquisition value of $6,500,000 or more, except for the Department of
Energy's Power Marketing Administration, where the estimated acquisition value is $8,000,000 or more.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicable rule of origin for NAFTA country end products under the agreement is that of ``substantial transformation'',
which means an article that is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a NAFTA country or has been substantially
transformed in a NAFTA country into a new and different article may be offered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Designates NAFTA country end products as eligible products under the Trade Agreements Act, as implemented in
Trade Agreements under the FAR;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Adds language to require that, when an overseas procurement for performance overseas is subject to NAFTA, it will
be synopsized in accordance with agency procedures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Revises the prescriptions for the provisions, Submission of Offers in the English Language, and Submission of
Offers in U.S. Currency, to clarify and include NAFTA;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Updates the list of designated countries in FAR 25.401 to add ``Portugal'' and revise ``Upper Volta'' to ``Burkina
Faso'';
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Includes the new threshold of $182,000 for application of the Trade Agreements Act and the European Community
(EC) Agreement, which is effective January 1, 1994;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Updates FAR 25.407 list of agencies covered by the Agreements on EC and NAFTA; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Makes clarifications to the interim rule published in FAC 90&hyph;18 (58 FR 31140), at FAR 25.407, to implement
the Memorandum of Understanding between the United States of America and the European Economic Community on Government
Procurement and NAFTA.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The interim rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because the rule waives the Buy American Act for certain Mexican and Canadian products. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis (IRFA) has been prepared and will be provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy for the Small Business Administration.
A copy of the IRFA may be obtained from the FAR Secretariat. Comments are invited. Comments from small entities concerning
the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately
and cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (FAR Case 93&hyph;310), in correspondence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) is deemed to apply because the new provision at 52.225&hyph;20
requires offerors to list the line item number and country of origin for any end product other than a domestic end product.
Accordingly, a request for clearance of a new information collection requirement concerning the NAFTA Act is being
submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Public comments concerning this requirement are invited through an OMB clearance request appearing in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 58 FR 68636, December 28, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Determination To Issue an Interim Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense (DOD), the Administrator of General
Services (GSA), and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that compelling
reasons exist to promulgate this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. This action is necessary
because the NAFTA Implementation Act, signed into law on December 8, 1993, becomes effective on January 1, 1994. However,
pursuant to Public Law 98&hyph;577 and Federal Acquisition Regulation 1.501, public comments received in response
to this interim rule will be considered in formulating the final rule.

the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057) and the

(2) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of materials from another country or instrumentality,

or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was transformed. The term includes services (except
transportation services) incidental to its supply; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

otherwise specified, the Acts apply to all items in the schedule. The Contractor agrees to deliver under this contract
only domestic end products unless, in its offer, it specifies delivery of foreign end products in the provision entitled
``Buy American Act_Trade Agreements_Balance of Payments Program Certificate.'' An offer certifying that a designated,
NAFTA, or Caribbean Basin country end product will be supplied requires the Contractor to supply a designated, NAFTA,
or Caribbean Basin country end product or, at the Contractor's option, a domestic end product. Contractors may not
supply a foreign end product for line items subject to the Trade Agreements Act unless the foreign end product is a designated,
NAFTA, or Caribbean end product (see FAR 25.401), or unless a waiver is granted under section 302 of the Trade Agreements
Act of 1979 (see FAR 25.402(c)).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as a participant in the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program, is issuing
interim regulations to govern the referral of delinquent debts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for offset against
the income tax refunds of persons owing money to EPA. These regulations allow EPA to collect debts by means of offset
from the income tax refunds of persons owing money to EPA provided certain conditions are met. This rule establishes
procedures to be followed by EPA in requesting the IRS to offset tax refunds due to taxpayers who have past-due legally
enforceable debt obligations to the EPA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule provides procedures for EPA to refer past-due legally enforceable debts to the IRS for offset against
the income tax refunds of persons owing debts to EPA. This rule is authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3720A, the purpose of which
is to improve the ability of the government to collect money owed it while adding certain notice requirements and other
protections applicable to the government's relationship to the debtor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule implements 31 U.S.C. 3720A, which directs any Federal agency that is owed a past-due legally enforceable
debt by a named person to notify the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with regulations issued by the Department
of the Treasury at 26 CFR 301.6402&hyph;6. Before a Federal agency may give such notice, however, it must first: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Notify the debtor that the agency proposes to refer the debt for a tax refund deduction; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Give the debtor 60 days from the date of the notification to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due
or legally enforceable; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider any evidence presented by the debtor and determine whether any amount of such debt is past-due and legally
enforceable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Satisfy such other conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe to ensure that the agency's determination
is valid and that the agency has made reasonable efforts to obtain payment of the debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule, in accordance with IRS regulations, provides that before EPA refers a debt to Treasury (through IRS), a
notice of intention (Notice of Intent) will be sent to the debtor. This Notice of Intent will inform the debtor of the
amount of the debt and that unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of EPA's Notice of Intent, EPA intends
to collect the debt by requesting the IRS to offset any tax refund payable to the debtor. In addition, the Notice of Intent
will state that the debtor has a right, during such period, to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due
or legally enforceable. This rule also establishes procedures for the debtor to present such evidence.

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of
the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken
or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan
programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out
of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.

Public Comments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to an agreement between the IRS, the Financial Management Service, and EPA regarding EPA's participation
in the Tax Refund Offset Program for 1994, EPA is required to have promulgated regulations regarding referral of debts
to IRS for tax refund offset prior to EPA's participation in the program. EPA is issuing interim final regulations
to take effect today in order to fulfill that requirement. Although EPA will respond to written comments on today's
notice, EPA is not holding a hearing, providing an opportunity for prior comments, or delaying the effective date
because this regulation is mostly procedural and because there are no significant issues of law or fact or relevant
substantial impacts on the Nation or large numbers of persons of which EPA could take account consistent with law.
Moreover, issuance of immediately effective interim final regulations does not prejudice the due process rights
of debtors and is essential in order for EPA to participate in the 1994 program. Written comments are solicited for
60 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A final document discussing any comments received and revisions required will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart establishes procedures for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to refer past-due debts to the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for offset against the income tax refunds of persons owing debts to EPA. It specifies
the Agency procedures and the rights of the debtor applicable to claims for the payment of debts owed to EPA.

Applicability and scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This subpart implements 31 U.S.C. 3720A, which authorizes the IRS to reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past-due
legally enforceable debt owed to the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For purposes of this section, a past-due legally enforceable debt referable to the IRS is a debt which is owed to
the United States and: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent for at least three months but has not been delinquent for
more than ten years at the time the offset is made; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2) or cannot be
collected by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by the Agency against amounts payable to or on behalf of
the debtor by or on behalf of the Agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) With respect to which EPA has given the taxpayer at least 60 days from the date of notification to present evidence
that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable, has considered evidence presented by such taxpayer,
if any, and has determined that an amount of such debt is past-due and legally enforceable; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Has been disclosed by EPA to a consumer reporting agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f), unless a consumer reporting
agency would be prohibited from using such information by 15 U.S.C. 1681c, or unless the amount of the debt does not
exceed $100.00; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) With respect to which EPA has notified or has made a reasonable attempt to notify the taxpayer that the debt is past-due
and, unless repaid within 60 days thereafter, the debt will be referred to the IRS for offset against any overpayment
of tax; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Is at least $25.00; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Department of the Treasury regulations at 26 CFR 301.6402&hyph;6
relating to the eligibility of a debt for tax return offset have been satisfied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;13.11, all administrative charges incurred in connection with the referral of a debt to
the IRS shall be assessed on the debt and thus increase the amount of the offset.

Notice requirement before offset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A request for reduction of an IRS tax refund will be made only after EPA makes a determination that an amount is owed and
past-due and provides the debtor with 60 days written notice. EPA's notice of intention to collect by IRS tax refund
offset (Notice of Intent) will state: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The amount of the debt; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of EPA's Notice of Intent, EPA intends to collect the debt
by requesting the IRS to reduce any amounts payable to the debtor as refunds of Federal taxes paid by an amount equal
to the amount of the debt and all accumulated interest and other charges; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) That the debtor has a right to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A mailing address for forwarding any written correspondence and a contact name and phone number for any questions.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notification by debtor. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A debtor who receives a Notice of Intent has the right to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due
or not legally enforceable. To exercise this right, the debtor must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Send a written request for a review of the evidence to the address provided in the notice;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) State in the request the amount disputed and the reasons why the debtor believes that the debt is not past-due or
is not legally enforceable; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Include in the request any documents which the debtor wishes to be considered or state that additional information
will be submitted within the remainder of the 60-day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of evidence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The debtor may submit evidence showing that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable along
with the notification required by paragraph (a) of this section. Failure to submit the notification and evidence
within 60 days will result in an automatic referral of the debt to the IRS without further action by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Review of the evidence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA will consider all available evidence related to the debt. Within 30 days, if feasible, EPA will notify the debtor
whether EPA has sustained, amended, or cancelled its determination that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Following review of the evidence, EPA will issue a written decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If EPA either sustains or amends its determination, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall notify the debtor of its intent to refer the debt to the IRS for offset against the debtor's Federal income tax
refund. If EPA cancels its original determination, the debt will not be referred to IRS.

If the debtor timely notifies the EPA that he or she is exercising the right described in &sect;13.38(a) and timely
submits evidence in accordance with &sect;13.38(b), any notice to the IRS will be stayed until the issuance of a written
decision which sustains or amends its original determination.
